1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,140
Rym: It's Wednesday April 12th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,730
Rym: We talk about Shinigami no ballad, and we have some final thoughts on mushishi.

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,968
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:23,966
Scott: You might notice that I'm not here and Rym's doing the news on his own.

5
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:26,999
Rym: yes indeed in fact We recorded this many days ago now.

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,307
Scott: the reason for this is because it's Passover Which means I don't go to work and I go do stuff with my family.

7
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:39,433
Rym: now I'll say that Scott wanted to do this disclaimer mostly for the same reason that I don't have a Darwin fish on my car even Though I used to.

8
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:40,217
Rym: now.

9
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:44,167
Rym: the reason I don't have a Darwin fish on my car is because from a distance It looks a lot like a Jesus fish.

10
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:46,230
Rym: Didn't want to confuse anyone.

11
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:55,799
Scott: I don't want anyone to be confused and think that because I'm not here on Passover that I somehow believe in an omnipotent deity despite my atheism.

12
00:00:56,102 --> 00:01:00,356
Scott: you see I'm not religiously Jewish.

13
00:01:00,797 --> 00:01:04,548
Scott: I'm sort of ethnically culturally Jewish sort of freaking Jewish.

14
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:05,953
Scott: well Think about this.

15
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:07,297
Scott: right an Irish guy.

16
00:01:07,378 --> 00:01:09,464
Scott: right Irish isn't really a religion.

17
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:11,190
Scott: It's sort of like a nationality culture.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,890
Scott: You know you drink in pubs, and you have leprechauns.

19
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:21,940
Rym: That's not the best example Scott.

20
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:23,529
Scott: No you got a better example.

21
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:25,836
Rym: Just do your bit.

22
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:28,310
Rym: Oh my god if anyone out there is Irish.

23
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,973
Rym: I'm sorry.

24
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,490
Rym: Scott for the longest time actually didn't know the difference between Ireland and Scotland.

25
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:35,381
Rym: He'd asked me like so which one has the leprechauns?

26
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,529
Rym: yeah, which one has golf right?

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,350
Scott: Scotland's a good one Scotland.

28
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:49,876
Scott: Yeah, you got kilts, and you got Loch Ness monsters, and you got all those things right, but they don't involve any particular like you know Fantastical beliefs.

29
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:52,366
Scott: you can be both Scottish and atheist at the same time.

30
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:53,410
Rym: What about magic runes?

31
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,213
Scott: Magic runes you can ignore.

32
00:01:55,634 --> 00:02:05,102
Scott: so I'm sort of like that like I'm Jewish because it's cool and fun in a cultural sort of Ethnic way, but I don't believe any of the crazy like.

33
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:06,667
Scott: oh, no if I'm not kosher.

34
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:07,610
Scott: It's terrible.

35
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,636
Rym: Oh, you don't cast spells from the Kabbalah.

36
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:11,622
Scott: No no that that's not even Jewish.

37
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:12,826
Scott: That's like crazy Jewish.

38
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,520
Scott: Yeah, it's like Wow, I'm not even gonna get into that.

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,486
Scott: That's all I need to do.

40
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:29,729
Scott: a show on that Yeah, a Jew show or even just a Kabbalah show cuz it's really becoming popular among idiots All right, yeah, so no one be confused and start screaming about how Scott's really Jewish or something cuz.

41
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:30,050
Scott: yeah

42
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:53,706
Rym: Well, it's like how I often end up celebrating like Christmas or Easter or Thanksgiving though Thanksgiving doesn't really apply, but I celebrate a lot of holidays just with my family or Emily's family or Just various people, but I only like I celebrate being with family and having fun, and I'm really not Caring so much that someone may or may not have died 2,000 years ago.

43
00:02:54,591 --> 00:03:00,649
Scott: Well you know what the godfather says a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,194
Scott: Yeah That's what that's about.

45
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:06,082
Scott: so I see you next week.

46
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:11,029
Rym: now that Scott's actually gone I can talk about the forum goings-on.

47
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:22,522
Rym: You see for those of you who haven't been following the forums too closely Flaming geek who we somewhat called out yesterday Decided not to accept our offer of amnesty.

48
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:26,681
Rym: He was lying about various things and we offered him to come clean.

49
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:45,729
Rym: he decided not to and I realized that we hadn't actually planned for the possibility of actually banning people from the forum Or how we would deal with that since we currently only actually have three moderators two of which are myself and Scott And then mr.. Period who would probably not actually ban anyone without talking to us.

50
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:55,109
Rym: so Scott is out of town And I decided that the best way to do this is to set up some sort of overly complicated and extremely fun to implement court-martial system.

51
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:59,897
Rym: Now I'll talk to Scott to see what he thinks of it But I'm very pleased with it.

52
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:11,630
Rym: basically if someone on the forum is For whatever reason doing something that is worthy of being banned I will put them in the group that marks them for a forum based court-martial.

53
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:29,575
Rym: All of their posts will be flagged and they will not be able to alter their profile or post anywhere At least for 24 hours while we have a thread that will be sticky describing the goings-on Why we feel he should be banned and asking for any comments from the forum at large After 24 hours.

54
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:34,255
Rym: if it is found that the person should indeed be banned We will ban them.

55
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:38,110
Rym: if anyone feels that there should be they should be given some sort of second chance.

56
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:49,122
Rym: I can put them in a probationary mode where they'll be able to speak in their own defense But only we'll be able to post in certain specific threads Our categories, and then we could see where it goes from there.

57
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:56,136
Rym: now as for the flamming geek No offense I hate to lose a listener.

58
00:04:56,397 --> 00:05:00,390
Rym: I'd love you to keep listening, but I really can't have you in our forums anymore.

59
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:07,037
Rym: The votes are thus far unanimous and unless something drastic happens overnight I'm going to ban you.

60
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:08,122
Rym: come tomorrow.

61
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:20,835
Rym: now again since Scott's not here I'm only going to do one news and one thing of the day obviously since he didn't record any ahead of time And then I'll go into an anime episode that we actually recorded some time ago in preparation for events Just like this.

62
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:38,270
Rym: so without further ado in the news I'm sure you're all aware of the lawsuit and scandals surrounding the fact that AT&T has allegedly been allowing the NSA to basically look over all of their records and databases for many years and In fact have been helping the NSA to spy on Americans.

63
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:43,998
Rym: Now these allegations are fairly serious And there are numerous lawsuits around this.

64
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:48,431
Rym: now the interesting news is not that this is going on because this was actually announced quite some Time ago.

65
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:58,810
Rym: the interesting part is that AT&T the defendant here has decided that they are going to try to Remove from the evidence all of the incriminating documents that they originally submitted.

66
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,522
Rym: Now these are documents that for various reasons.

67
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:11,930
Rym: I'm not really going to go into the details about it But they described the spying program how it was undertaken These specific means that were used and all sorts of juicy tidbits.

68
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:19,258
Rym: AT&T feels for various reasons that these documents should be stricken from the record and Not used in the lawsuit against them.

69
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:22,750
Rym: now AT&T's rationale here is somewhat interesting.

70
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:37,367
Rym: they are saying that the widespread criticism and press coverage about the case has been causing quote grave injury to AT&T and they furthermore claim that it is Releasing their trade secrets to the wild and making them vulnerable to attacks by hackers.

71
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:39,719
Rym: personally I find these claims laughable.

72
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:44,583
Rym: AT&T got caught doing something They shouldn't be doing and they're doing everything within their power to get out of it.

73
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:49,061
Rym: now on a more broad level This isn't the only spying scandal going on.

74
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:51,130
Rym: I mean aside from AT&T spying on all of us.

75
00:06:51,772 --> 00:07:15,390
Rym: I know you all know that President Bush had a while ago authorized the spying on American citizens who were calling foreign countries and He also recently admitted and even was proud of the fact that they're also Authorizing the spying of entirely domestic conversations despite the fact that he has at no point ever gone to a FISA court to get warrants for this Despite the fact that even as previous presidents have indicated is quite trivial to do.

76
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:29,930
Rym: Now, I don't know about you, but I really don't like the idea of my government spying on me Particularly when my government has been rather shall we say rash Even evil or wellian lately.

77
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:33,010
Rym: It's kind of a slippery slope scary trend.

78
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,929
Rym: I hate to use the term slippery slope and I hate to use that sort of argument But this is a very slippery slope.

79
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,117
Rym: I mean every it just.

80
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:42,702
Rym: it's getting worse every day.

81
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:48,568
Rym: and the scary thing is it's not that the spying is getting worse every Day, it's that we're finding out more about it every day.

82
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:57,069
Rym: now I know we actually have a lot of listeners who aren't inside of the United States and all I really have to say to you Is that despite what other problems the countries you live in may have?

83
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:17,650
Rym: I would consider you fairly lucky in many ways that you don't have to deal with the things that we're dealing with as a nation right now and If things continue on the trend they're continuing I mean actually continuing exactly the way they are and getting worse at the same rate Then I really can't see myself continuing to live in this country within the next I don't know decade or so maybe even sooner.

84
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:22,510
Rym: But that's all talk for another time since this is GeekNights anime day and not GeekNights politics day.

85
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:35,419
Rym: So without further ado, so my thing of the day Now I didn't actually find this today.

86
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:39,980
Rym: I found it while Scott found it yesterday and we were both reading it and we almost used it as a thing of the day.

87
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,539
Rym: It just got lost out to other things.

88
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:45,453
Rym: But I thought this was very interesting and I'm glad that they have.

89
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:47,600
Rym: I have the opportunity to share it with all of you today.

90
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:56,479
Rym: Now if you know David Copperfield the magician He has a fairly famous flying trick that many people really have no idea how he did it.

91
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:59,350
Rym: He flies around a stage in front of a live audience.

92
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,294
Rym: He flies through hoops.

93
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:14,220
Rym: He flies into this glass container and then they put a lid on it, but he can still fly and This website very succinctly and very clearly shows you exactly how this trick is done in a very clear and easy to understand way.

94
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:24,326
Rym: Basically all he was doing is he has two incredibly incredibly thin special Wires and a little harness around his waist and the wires are almost invisible.

95
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:28,021
Rym: They're tiny tiny tiny little wires and that's it.

96
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:34,142
Rym: when he goes into the little box the wires are so thin that they slide to the side and They're still.

97
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:36,131
Rym: they just go to the side around the cover.

98
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:38,019
Rym: they put on the box and then they still go up to the winch.

99
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,100
Rym: He doesn't actually fly through the hoops.

100
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,528
Rym: He does some sort of trick that you could.

101
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,760
Rym: they explain it with a little animation on this site.

102
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:46,996
Rym: Now the site itself went down fairly quickly.

103
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:50,360
Rym: I Wonder if anything was done.

104
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:58,800
Rym: I mean I know magicians are traditionally very secretive about the way they do their magic and I wonder if this was any sort of retaliation for someone revealing it.

105
00:09:59,146 --> 00:09:59,779
Rym: I have no idea.

106
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:06,465
Rym: all I know is that I'm linking to the Google cache that has the vast majority of the content for you all of you to See complete with the pictures.

107
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,154
Rym: So it being Wednesday and anime day.

108
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:10,238
Rym: We have two shows.

109
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:19,940
Rym: yet again We are going to review and have our final thoughts on mushishi and Actually, there are going to be no spoilers in that part because mushishi doesn't have spoilers.

110
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:24,613
Scott: yeah, really like if we told you how any particular episode ended.

111
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:30,240
Scott: that might be a spoiler for that episode, but There is no overarching plot of mushishi.

112
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:39,471
Scott: It's purely episodic that and we're going to talk about preview Shinigami Which we saw one episode of and we're probably not gonna watch anymore.

113
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:40,795
Rym: it started out.

114
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:42,240
Rym: Yeah, and it went.

115
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:44,484
Scott: It's see.

116
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:46,718
Scott: basically the story of the show is there's this.

117
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:58,200
Scott: Well, if you don't know a shinigami is like a grim reaper a god of death god of death and they go around Collecting souls of dead people or writing in death notes, right?

118
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,938
Scott: But that's in other comics and such and there's an anime even it's not even a comic.

119
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:12,080
Scott: So it's a story of this girl who's a shinigami and Her little shinigami cat which is cute and has little devil wings and he's really an asshole.

120
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:14,590
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like a kamako.

121
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:15,574
Rym: Haha.

122
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:20,803
Rym: I forgot all about a kamako And It seemed.

123
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:31,545
Scott: we don't know if it's episodic or serial, but it seems like each episode She goes and kills someone and you basically you don't see a lot of this girl who's the shinigami so much.

124
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:48,188
Scott: you see more of like the characters that are involved with the death and It's like, you know, you get to know a few characters over the course of the episode and you know what their story is and you know you get along with them and then someone dies and then The shinigami appears and the episodes over

125
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:58,540
Rym: now, it seemed like a neat idea to me at first, you know we have a very heartwarming show where you can explore death and the way people react to it and the Reactions of the shinigami who actually has to do it and you know something nice.

126
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,545
Rym: It's really just kind of contrived and boring.

127
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:13,093
Scott: honestly, yeah, it seemed really silly and Plain very plain Like there's a guy There's a girl the guys with the girl.

128
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:14,379
Rym: the girl has a sickness.

129
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:18,435
Scott: The girl and the guy are working together to take care of the stray cat.

130
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:19,640
Rym: the girl dies.

131
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,108
Scott: The guy was well refers.

132
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:29,979
Scott: the other important plot is the guy wants to hang out and play soccer with his friends But oh he feels bad for the girl cuz she's gonna die.

133
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:38,245
Rym: And then sure enough she dies and he decides he wants to kill the cat because it's the cat's fault that she died Kinda kinda sorta.

134
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,192
Rym: and then the shinigami appears.

135
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:41,336
Rym: We're ruining the whole first episode.

136
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:41,797
Rym: It doesn't matter.

137
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:46,574
Rym: The show's not good Yeah, and basically says oh if you leave the cat out in the rain, it'll die.

138
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:47,276
Rym: Do you want that?

139
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:48,179
Rym: And he's like, yeah, whatever.

140
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:54,728
Rym: and then she tries to kill the cat because she's a shinigami and he saves it and It just really doesn't go anywhere.

141
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:55,191
Rym: That's it.

142
00:12:55,211 --> 00:13:00,472
Scott: That's the end of the episode pretty much You know, then it's like oh, it's sad the girl died, but it's okay.

143
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:00,893
Scott: She would have.

144
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:04,786
Scott: you know, it's the way of the world Be happy and that's it.

145
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:10,020
Rym: The show just feels a lot less inspired than a show that has so much potential it should be.

146
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:18,338
Scott: Yeah, I mean if they made the show maybe like about the shinigami like observing people or something

147
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:29,780
Rym: or if they just did what they're Doing where it's just 26 or however many one-shot treatments of death and how people react to it Yeah, but no no, I mean it is that but it just wasn't good.

148
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,884
Rym: I didn't there was.

149
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:32,770
Rym: no I didn't really empathize with the characters.

150
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,934
Rym: I didn't really feel anything.

151
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:34,676
Rym: I didn't really care.

152
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:37,168
Rym: I Definitely spent more time yelling.

153
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:38,134
Rym: I'll bet the girl dies.

154
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:39,200
Rym: No, I'll bet the guy dies.

155
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:41,147
Rym: No, they're the cats gonna fucking die.

156
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,953
Rym: then we did, you know actually caring.

157
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:49,120
Scott: Yeah, I think The problem is is that the real characters don't get enough time at all.

158
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,179
Scott: I mean the awesome devil cat was on the screen for maybe a minute and

159
00:13:53,981 --> 00:14:04,820
Rym: Actually the devil cat and the shinigami they come in right away and They don't say anything and they're on the screen for maybe 30 seconds And then you don't really see him again until the last few minutes of the episode.

160
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,860
Rym: They don't when they kill they don't actually really do anything which would be fine again.

161
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,148
Rym: It's just I guess.

162
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,000
Rym: here's what the main thing that bothered me about the show.

163
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,819
Rym: A lot of shows are very atmospheric and I usually like that.

164
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:19,473
Rym: You know the camera will pan around a lot and they spend time looking at the environment.

165
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:27,815
Rym: characters are in and it's not just face shot Face shot face shot action shot like American shows tend to be but I mean a place promise did that really well.

166
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:33,940
Rym: now this show Seems to be trying to do that, but it's not good.

167
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:35,666
Rym: It's hard to explain.

168
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:46,020
Rym: but like the camera kept panning to things that just it looked like they were lazy And they didn't want to animate the whole show So they kept panning the camera to static useless shots of like half of a tin of cat food.

169
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:50,000
Scott: Yeah, it's not exactly the highest production value show.

170
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,577
Rym: I mean the animation is basically standard for modern-day animation and honestly, I don't think the voice acting is that good.

171
00:14:56,597 --> 00:15:00,913
Scott: I Wasn't really paying attention, but it sounded just like people talking.

172
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:04,361
Scott: It wasn't like Sounded.

173
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,213
Rym: it sounded like people talking.

174
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:12,354
Scott: Hey, yeah Well, you know actually the voice actor for the devil cat was good and you know what.

175
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:14,503
Scott: the only thing the show has going for It is a double kit.

176
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:15,890
Scott: Yeah, say that right now.

177
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,984
Scott: Yeah, they should just make a show about that cat Whatever his name is.

178
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:21,836
Rym: Well, actually the Shinigami is very cool-looking.

179
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:22,620
Rym: I like the way she was drawn.

180
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:28,175
Scott: Yeah, she's kind of glowy with the red shoes and I don't know about the red shoes.

181
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:31,029
Scott: and then with the big sigh it's it's sort of.

182
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:36,807
Scott: it looks like a. You know either a you know Taku kind of look like the kind of things.

183
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:40,198
Scott: Oh, Taku like like they'll probably go like little models of her.

184
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:46,200
Rym: and and Yeah, she's definitely designed in the same vein that like Chi from Chobits was designed.

185
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:52,811
Scott: Yeah, it appeals to a certain demographic not us No, but the devil cat right up our alley.

186
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:54,316
Rym: Well, the devil cats an asshole.

187
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:55,139
Scott: That's the idea.

188
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,111
Rym: So really we're not gonna say any more about the show.

189
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,839
Rym: it's probably not worth watching.

190
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,869
Scott: Actually, we can contrast the show with mushishi.

191
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:11,920
Scott: You see mushishi, which is what we're gonna talk about now Which we're gonna semi spoil because there really isn't an overarching plot to spoil.

192
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,412
Scott: But we might say what happens at the end of a few of the episodes.

193
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:25,870
Rym: so now mushishi just y'all know We've talked about it before we reviewed it when we'd seen I don't know five or six episodes And if you search through the archives, you'll find that We've seen the whole show now.

194
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:30,243
Scott: It's a 20 episode show now unlike Shinigami.

195
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:30,784
Scott: no valid.

196
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:36,300
Scott: We're like the strongest characters being the Shinigami and the devil cat barely appear.

197
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:42,857
Scott: You know the strongest character in mushishi is ginkgo who's the main dude and he always appears.

198
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:49,395
Scott: he's all around Even though it's also episodic and the story is never except for one episode.

199
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:51,320
Scott: The story is never about ginkgo.

200
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,800
Scott: It's always about some other people and he's just they're helping or figuring it out, but he's always there enough and he's awesome.

201
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:01,792
Scott: So it kind of works out whereas in Shinigami no valid it's.

202
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:05,631
Scott: you know, it's also not about the Shinigami But the Shinigami is not there.

203
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:12,579
Rym: Yeah Now, I mean we talked about it before so I'm not gonna explain the whole concept of the show in detail again.

204
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,617
Rym: But basically mushishi is about.

205
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,029
Rym: well It's a world that it's kind of hard to place.

206
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:21,001
Rym: what era the show the story is set in Like.

207
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:24,371
Rym: it could be medieval or like late medieval Japan.

208
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,473
Rym: It could be modern Japan.

209
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:26,557
Rym: It's really hard to tell.

210
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:34,140
Scott: I Don't think it's modern Japan because everyone seems to be living in villages in the mountains somewhere through villages in the middle of nowhere.

211
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:36,358
Scott: so it's like pre.

212
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:43,285
Scott: you know modern Japan when people still had some sort of traditional stuff and you know everyone.

213
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:57,031
Scott: you wore kimonos all the time and of course, it is definitely a Non-standard historical timeline because there are mushi about yeah, and there are not samurais or ninjas about Which tells you something.

214
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:04,200
Rym: but basically in this world There are these mushi which are like a cross between a ghost and a spirit and a bacteria.

215
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:17,153
Scott: Yeah, I think they describe them as like creatures that are somewhat in-between plant and animal and nothing and they go around in the world just like bacteria and everything would and they're most.

216
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:18,739
Rym: people can't see him and don't interact with them.

217
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:25,420
Rym: and Whenever mushi or mushi and humans come together Strange things tend to happen.

218
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:36,170
Scott: I mean some mushi cause good things some bad things some have no effect Some just cause a weird effect that doesn't actually do anything like oh my god The mountain looks like it has a hole in it, but nothing happens.

219
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:48,340
Rym: now some people called mushishi are mushi catchers or mushi doctors and for whatever reason they can see the mushi and As a result mushi are attracted to them so they really can't stay in one place for long or mushi.

220
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,260
Scott: I don't know if mushi are attracted to all the mushishi or if that was just ginkgo's thing because of what happened to him In the episode that told us about him.

221
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,644
Rym: Yeah, it's hard to say but they've.

222
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:01,098
Rym: they've mentioned that a couple times about other mushishi - did they?

223
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:10,987
Rym: yeah I'm pretty sure I don't remember that but anyway all the way it's obvious that all the mushishi tend to travel around and Just help people with mushi.

224
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:13,418
Rym: they study mushi they kill mushi they capture mushi.

225
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:19,160
Scott: Yeah, it's like imagine if it it's sort of like Pokemon where there's these creatures about that.

226
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:26,542
Scott: You know are a new class of creature, and they do stuff, but people aren't collecting them to fight against each other They're.

227
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:29,674
Scott: they treat them more like you know diseases.

228
00:19:29,694 --> 00:19:30,557
Scott: I guess kinda.

229
00:19:30,658 --> 00:19:32,124
Scott: It's like They.

230
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:34,759
Scott: they do things and people go around correcting them.

231
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:36,105
Scott: You know they're not.

232
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:39,340
Scott: some of you know some of them are good and some of them are bad.

233
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:45,440
Scott: But you won't see like two mushishi meet up and all of a sudden whip out their mushishi and see which ones are higher level.

234
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:47,891
Scott: It's not about that.

235
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:53,351
Scott: It's it's Sort of like these spiritual stories of things in fact.

236
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:56,640
Rym: We never really run into any other mushishi until the last episode.

237
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:03,235
Scott: Yeah, well there are some mushishi about but you don't really care about them now.

238
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,324
Rym: like we said we've seen the whole show now and For starters the show is very episodic.

239
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:20,719
Rym: every episode is basically entirely on its own with the tiniest vague bit of continuity in that ginkgo the main character has been around and he's been to all these places already mm-hmm and That is done very well.

240
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:23,569
Scott: Yeah, you know it seems like everything.

241
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:37,115
Scott: I most of the media that I engage nowadays is Siri is if not completely serial at least somewhat serial in that you know it's Last time on such-and-such next time on such-and-such, and it just continues.

242
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,560
Scott: comics just continue.

243
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:44,932
Scott: You know it's like you got to wait for the next issue with the next something you know to continue the story And you forget that.

244
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:48,006
Scott: hey episodic stuff You know is also good.

245
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:48,327
Scott: you get.

246
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,294
Scott: you know shows like The Simpsons are episodic.

247
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:58,819
Scott: every episode is different and When in most anime are not episodic so when one is it's like kind of weird, but it can still be good.

248
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:07,419
Rym: Now if any of you are wondering like we said no there is no overarching plot at all And it's one of those shows that doesn't end it simply stops.

249
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:11,932
Rym: There's no resolution nothing special happens in the last episode.

250
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:12,975
Rym: It's just the show's over.

251
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:15,304
Scott: Yeah at the end of episode 20 They're like that's it.

252
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:17,053
Scott: We're not making any more, and they give you.

253
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:18,280
Scott: they put a picture on the screen.

254
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,110
Scott: That's like the end.

255
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:27,159
Rym: Thank you for watching Bye-bye, and I guess the fact that I wasn't at all disappointed with that really really makes me respect the show and enjoy it.

256
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:35,290
Scott: Yeah, it is definitely a excellent show, but you know as with any episodic show You can always want for more episodes.

257
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:40,020
Rym: I would love to see the show go on forever Yeah, as long as the quality didn't diminish.

258
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:47,039
Rym: Yeah, I mean the cool thing about the show is that it's definitely not for the most part as far as I can tell based on any actual legends.

259
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:50,173
Scott: It's but all the it is based on legends.

260
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:51,923
Scott: It's based on obscure ones We don't know,

261
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:58,717
Rym: but all the stories have this very like Japanese fairytale folktale feeling to them

262
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:03,359
Scott: like if you told someone it was a legend they would believe you easily and

263
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:11,583
Rym: It really had this neat idea of like a lot of times People even in the show would talk about the legend of such-and-such and Ginkgo the mushishi.

264
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:16,018
Rym: would you know hear about this and realize that it's not anything magical.

265
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:16,680
Rym: It's just a mushi.

266
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,206
Rym: I know exactly what mushi that is.

267
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:20,657
Rym: I'm gonna go kill it or stop it or whatever.

268
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:21,159
Rym: mm-hmm.

269
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:27,857
Scott: Of course he usually solves the problems not by killing mushi, but by you know doing something to him.

270
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:33,800
Rym: or yeah You get the impression that most mushishi tend to go around just killing mushi or capturing them for fun.

271
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:41,620
Scott: Yeah, but ginkgo the main guy he kind of goes around like fixing him like a doctor.

272
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:47,899
Rym: Yeah, well he very much seems to have the philosophy that they live in their world We live in ours, and we all just have to live together.

273
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:56,620
Rym: Yeah, now if you wonder about ginkgo's past because the show is very episodic We will say that there is one episode that basically it's ginkgo's origin story.

274
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,750
Rym: It basically gives you everything you actually need to know about ginkgo.

275
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:04,774
Scott: Yeah, it tells you why he's got one eyeball And why he doesn't remember.

276
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:10,380
Scott: like before He was mushishi, and why are mushi following him around everywhere?

277
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,766
Scott: He can't stay in one place for too long, and it explains all of that stuff, but other than that It's just like every other episode.

278
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:19,759
Scott: You know there's a mushi problem, and he runs into it.

279
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,576
Rym: Yep, and not one nice thing is that it's not a very predictable show.

280
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:24,520
Rym: I mean some episodes.

281
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,330
Rym: He saves whoever was caught by mushi some episodes.

282
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:27,872
Rym: They die.

283
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:28,795
Rym: some episodes.

284
00:23:28,835 --> 00:23:30,200
Rym: something horrible ends up happening.

285
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:34,920
Rym: It's really random and you really can't predict how an episode will go based on any sort of meta.

286
00:23:35,743 --> 00:23:37,810
Rym: Oh, they always save the girl in the end logic.

287
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:39,757
Scott: Yeah, there is one thing though.

288
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:48,419
Scott: it seemed like There were certain components that each story was made out of and they seem to be running out of new components with which to make stories.

289
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:48,660
Scott: like.

290
00:23:49,342 --> 00:23:54,200
Scott: You know it started to follow sort of a formula towards the end of shows up in town.

291
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,785
Scott: Someone's sick with something He can't figure out what it is He tries to figure it out.

292
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:03,533
Scott: He does something he leaves he comes back.

293
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:08,447
Scott: the situation is different than it was when he left Then he does something else and then it's over.

294
00:24:08,568 --> 00:24:15,535
Rym: yeah, though at that point in the show it seemed like they started introducing more elements Like we're not gonna spoil this one, but mushi mail.

295
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:20,214
Rym: no Even though actually I thought that episode was really cool.

296
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:21,380
Scott: It was an okay episode.

297
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,288
Scott: Yeah with the blanket and whatnot.

298
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:25,779
Rym: yeah the best part in the show is when the mud monster appears.

299
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:29,660
Scott: Yeah, it's like certain parts of the show like stuff.

300
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:38,567
Scott: That's sort of the show moves kind of like not story wise But physically slowly like there aren't.

301
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:43,260
Scott: there isn't a lot of quick action or cutting or things zooming around quick.

302
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,440
Scott: It's like everything's kind of calm and moving around nicely and everyone walks and talks slowly

303
00:24:49,902 --> 00:25:04,460
Rym: Which is really really interesting because whenever there is action which is rare But when something is happening immediately, it's such a stark contrast between ginkgo walking slowly You know through the wasteland for hours and hours and suddenly crazy action for three seconds.

304
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,549
Scott: Yeah, it's like all of a sudden.

305
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:08,860
Scott: You know the monsters coming out of the mud.

306
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,166
Scott: It's like whoa cuz.

307
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:16,111
Scott: usually the show is like nice and calm and peaceful like And then all of a sudden a monster.

308
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:20,420
Scott: Oh my god, but no it's not a monster It's just ginkgo coming out of the mud, and then you laugh hysterically.

309
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:32,434
Rym: And the show is very I don't want to say realistic, but it's realistic in the sense that it's Sad happy humorous dark all at once.

310
00:25:32,454 --> 00:25:34,020
Rym: It's just there's no real pattern to it.

311
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,059
Rym: I mean the show is it's very real feeling.

312
00:25:37,882 --> 00:25:43,480
Rym: The characters feel very realistic in that they react to things in the way that people would probably actually react to them.

313
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:45,426
Scott: Yeah, it's never like.

314
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:59,267
Scott: you know it doesn't seem like any of the characters like usually in a show You have like that guy is the comic relief and each character is associated with some sort of emotion like that's the angry guy And that's the sad girl, and that's the what you know.

315
00:25:59,387 --> 00:26:01,252
Scott: everyone seems to be everything.

316
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:05,105
Scott: You know sometimes ginkgo's like oh You're sick.

317
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:14,158
Scott: I don't think you're gonna get better, and he's all kind of Sad about that, but then another time something he'll joke about something and he's like hey, what's up?

318
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,000
Scott: It's funny.

319
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:23,468
Rym: Now despite the generally very serious nature of the show it is often humorous But the humor is very subtle and very wry.

320
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:27,459
Rym: oh very subtle and I mean to the point of we and you.

321
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:29,029
Rym: really once you Start watching the show more.

322
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,380
Rym: This is my favorite aspect of the show.

323
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,240
Rym: It's that you you learn about how the show and how the world works as you watch.

324
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:35,760
Rym: But they don't tell you anything outright.

325
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:39,620
Rym: They don't say these kind of moosh here like this and these kind of like this.

326
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,639
Rym: But as you watch and you watch ginkgo solve these problems you start figuring out How you would solve them if you were him yeah?

327
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,792
Scott: Well he's also figuring out cuz you know he doesn't know everything about.

328
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,977
Scott: there is to know about mushi.

329
00:26:50,017 --> 00:26:59,116
Scott: so a lot of times He'll show up in town, and there'll be a problem, and he'll be like huh I don't know what kind of mushi it is and then he'll figure it out And he'd like ah I know now yep

330
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,287
Rym: And you'll figure it out right along with him.

331
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:06,109
Rym: after you watch the first half the show and you start figuring out how these things Work because they're very self consistent.

332
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,597
Scott: the other brought the other thing.

333
00:27:07,618 --> 00:27:11,719
Scott: that was Sometimes he'll come in in town and be like oh, it's the blugga blugga blugga mushi.

334
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:13,186
Scott: I know what kind that is.

335
00:27:13,246 --> 00:27:16,540
Scott: it does this and this and this and he'll tell you the story about how that mushi works.

336
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:24,572
Rym: But in terms of the humor like once it's like once you get to know ginkgo I mean he seems like a very mysterious character in fact in the first episode.

337
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:26,480
Rym: I didn't know he was the main character.

338
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:35,437
Scott: Yeah, well, I kind of guess yeah Shows called mushishi, and he is a mushishi so true, but I mean the show starts with his boy.

339
00:27:35,457 --> 00:27:38,171
Scott: well at first I didn't realize the show was gonna be episodic.

340
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:38,915
Scott: that was the thing.

341
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,513
Scott: yeah It was gonna be episodic.

342
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:52,576
Rym: I would have known that Ginkgo is the main character right away, so it does tell you at the end of the first episode when they basically say I Never found out what happened to that boy, but I knew he would do great things or something like that.

343
00:27:52,858 --> 00:28:04,460
Rym: yep Now one temporarily the show tends to skip around Into the future a lot like he'll do something in a village And then he'll leave and then the narrator will say you know two years hence.

344
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:07,555
Rym: And then you find out like what happened two years later to the people he helped.

345
00:28:07,575 --> 00:28:08,158
Rym: mm-hmm.

346
00:28:09,202 --> 00:28:11,490
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't seem to actually care about time at all.

347
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:16,873
Scott: like you could probably rearrange the episodes a whole lot And it wouldn't make a lot of difference at all.

348
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:19,488
Scott: I Mean some of them might make some difference.

349
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:26,340
Scott: like if you find out the story of ginkgo right away Then you might not understand because you didn't learn about mushi enough for the previous episodes.

350
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:33,660
Rym: Yeah Or you might miss a lot of the humor in later episodes because you can really only spot it if you've gotten to know ginkgo from the previous 15 episodes.

351
00:28:34,401 --> 00:28:40,480
Scott: Yeah, I think the funniest part was when this is one guy who seems to recur in a few episodes that he sells.

352
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:43,700
Scott: Oh that guy that guy there is there is a recurring character.

353
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:53,169
Scott: He's a guy that ginkgo sells interesting artifacts to things that he collects along the way while he's mushi-ing not mushi themselves But like physical things there's.

354
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:56,000
Rym: and there's this one time where he kind of rips the guy off.

355
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:57,411
Scott: Yeah, like most of the time.

356
00:28:57,452 --> 00:28:58,420
Scott: He doesn't rip the guy off.

357
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,600
Scott: He sells him the real stuff for a fair price, and this is a smart guy.

358
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:05,118
Scott: He's actually the guy's a doctor not in mushi-shi, but a doctor.

359
00:29:06,441 --> 00:29:09,820
Scott: But one time he goes and he has this he wants to get this coat.

360
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:12,939
Scott: There's like magic coat sort of thing to sell to the guy.

361
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:15,829
Scott: But the guy who owns the coat won't give it to ginkgo.

362
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:18,840
Scott: so ginkgo is like how about you just make me an exact copy?

363
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:27,980
Rym: And then he goes and sells it to the guy and he's like hey Now the scene when he sells it to him is just great because like it's outwardly just very simple business transaction.

364
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,788
Rym: But you're if you look at ginkgo.

365
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:32,600
Rym: He's got this very subtle expression on his face.

366
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:38,759
Rym: That's different from an expression You've ever seen him make before and it's obvious that he just can't contain the fact that he's ripping this guy off.

367
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:43,975
Scott: Yeah, and he's like yeah, cuz the real coat has like magic like smoke appears on it.

368
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:46,992
Scott: It's sort of magical, but It's not magic.

369
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:47,839
Scott: It's mushi-ical.

370
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:53,680
Rym: That's a perfectly cromulant word.

371
00:29:53,981 --> 00:30:02,180
Scott: It is perfectly cromulant, but what he tells this guy is he's like yes smoke appears on it once every seven years And the guy's like oh, I hope it happens soon.

372
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:08,543
Rym: Ginkgo's like yeah, yeah, we'll see I Just really like.

373
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:14,618
Rym: it sounds weird, but getting to know ginkgo as I watch the show Like you really start to feel like you know this guy.

374
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:16,792
Scott: He's a cool guy.

375
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:19,800
Scott: yeah It's like you know right away.

376
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,764
Scott: it's like you know not.

377
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,015
Scott: a lot of the people in some of the episodes you like like.

378
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:31,018
Scott: some of them are cool and some of them are dumb and Some of them are just naive or whatever, but ginkgo is always cool, and he's in control and knows.

379
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:41,125
Scott: It's up You know and the way he handles things is a good way like he doesn't force it on anyone, but you know he doesn't Just let shit be.

380
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:44,118
Scott: he tries to fix it without being evil.

381
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:59,819
Rym: Now I noticed one kind of interesting trend, and I don't know if it was on purpose or what but it seemed that Whenever there is a situation where a man and a woman are together in some way and Amushi affects one of them It always seemed to affect the woman.

382
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:02,179
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what was up with that.

383
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:09,238
Rym: I just I don't know if that was a conscious decision if it just ended up that way because it's not true 100% of The time, but it just seems like a trend.

384
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:15,490
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what it was But there was the episode where the guy had the pillow.

385
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,796
Scott: remember like you think he killed everyone in the village.

386
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:22,891
Scott: Yeah, yeah Yeah, that one was kind of that was one of my favorite ones too.

387
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:23,372
Scott: Actually.

388
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:23,834
Rym: I don't know.

389
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:25,719
Rym: I like the baby swamps baby swamps.

390
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:31,486
Scott: See it seems like the women were affected by mushi more But I don't think they.

391
00:31:31,948 --> 00:31:34,099
Scott: you know there are plenty of men affected by mushi.

392
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,740
Scott: It wasn't like some sexist thing is just the store that just happened to be the stories plus.

393
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,849
Scott: It was based on a manga that I haven't read.

394
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,295
Rym: I'd like to read it now.

395
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:45,547
Scott: Yeah, and we have to find it I don't know and it's not an English yet.

396
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,020
Scott: I don't think it's gonna be for I don't know if it's licensed it.

397
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,345
Scott: I don't think so.

398
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:52,875
Scott: I'll make Emily happy.

399
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:54,220
Scott: we could talk it We.

400
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,653
Scott: she she is apparently animated where it's called two Z's or something.

401
00:31:58,693 --> 00:31:59,395
Scott: doesn't that what you said?

402
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:01,000
Rym: Oh, I don't remember offhand.

403
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:02,916
Scott: Yeah, it's like usually there's like.

404
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:08,985
Scott: Basically for every three frames of animation in a normal anime There are two.

405
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:12,540
Scott: or is it for every one frame of animation in a normal anime?

406
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,597
Scott: There's two frames of animation in mushishi or something like that.

407
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:17,083
Rym: I don't.

408
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:22,140
Rym: all I remember is that we should probably ask her and get her to send us a wave file from Japan.

409
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:31,950
Scott: Just to put it I know for sure that the there are more frames of animation per second in mushishi and as a result the animation is Smoother and higher quality.

410
00:32:32,554 --> 00:32:33,399
Scott: I know that for sure.

411
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:46,440
Rym: So I guess in the end our recommendation since we've seen the show from start to finish Is that it's probably the best show to have come out recently that we've seen so far and it's well worth watching.

412
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:47,966
Rym: It also hasn't been licensed yet.

413
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:49,190
Rym: So it's readily available.

414
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:49,813
Scott: Yep.

415
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:51,740
Scott: Go hit them bit Torrance.

416
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,638
Scott: There should be some Torrance that'll have all 20 episodes pretty soon.

417
00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:56,791
Rym: Plus it's definitely one of those shows that cuz.

418
00:32:56,831 --> 00:33:02,766
Rym: I'm not one who buys a lot of anime Netflix and I only buy something that I would want to own Because it's just so awesome.

419
00:33:02,787 --> 00:33:06,119
Rym: I'd want to show to people and I think mushishi is a show that I would like to own.

420
00:33:07,282 --> 00:33:15,100
Scott: You know, I probably normally wouldn't want to own it But because it's only 20 episodes it might be in like some really nice for DVD box set.

421
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,840
Scott: That's that's small and cheap for like 30 or 40 bucks even like all the slayers box.

422
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,386
Rym: That's our.

423
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:22,512
Scott: yeah because of that It might be worth it.

424
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:27,680
Scott: because you know If it was a 26 episode show that cost like a hundred bucks, then maybe I wouldn't want it.

425
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,279
Scott: But yeah, if it's only if if it comes out and it's four DVDs in a little tiny box, then that's totally worth it.

426
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:37,680
Scott: Especially if you get a nice sale at a con or something.

427
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:43,562
Scott: Yeah Or maybe a TV will pick it up and you can wait three years and get it cheap on a holiday when they have a Supercell.

428
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:45,388
Rym: if they'll take your credit card.

429
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:50,402
Scott: Yeah, we'll say oh Right stuff is the one who doesn't take the credit card.

430
00:33:58,028 --> 00:34:00,670
