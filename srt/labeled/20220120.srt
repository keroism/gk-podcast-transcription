1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,435
Rym: It's Thursday, January 20th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:09,696
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:14,490
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,857
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:18,109
Rym: Tonight we are talking about greeting cards.

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,307
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:25,110
Rym: So I am continuing my odyssey and I've turned this into an actual challenge.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,289
Rym: My goal now, like what am I just low-key goals in my life?

9
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,570
Rym: Lower priority than Genji because I'm rapidly approaching the finish line.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,519
Rym: I don't think Genji's got much longer to live.

11
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,490
Rym: He's uh, anyway.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,318
Rym: So, uh, I'm trying now.

13
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:49,250
Rym: My goal is to beat every single song in DDR on every difficulty, nine feet or under, not like max 300 legend of max.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,030
Rym: Like, cause that did, that shit didn't even exist until like six.

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:01:00,730
Scott: So basically you said a line, you said, this is the difficulty of DDR song that I'm capable of beating and I'm going to beat every song that's that level or easier.

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,970
Rym: So it's a little more than that because.

17
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:05,750
Scott: That's like saying I can lift a hundred pounds.

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,590
Scott: I'm going to lift every rock on earth that weighs less than a hundred.

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,710
Rym: Actually, you know why I picked?

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,910
Rym: I actually did not pick that line for that reason because as of now, there are several songs I cannot pass following my rule.

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,110
Scott: And you set the bar a little bit higher to level up.

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:27,130
Rym: And in fact, uh, before recently, most of the songs that I've passed in this challenge, I passed for the first time in the last two or three weeks.

23
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:30,090
Rym: And it was never able to pass in my life up till this point.

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,470
Scott: Is that because you had never done them before in your life?

25
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:33,949
Rym: Some of them I'd never done before.

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,350
Rym: Some of them I had tried to do.

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,550
Scott: I could do a song on basic and be like, wow, I've never been able to beat that before.

28
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,229
Rym: Oh, no, I'm only talking about nine footers.

29
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:45,028
Rym: Most of the nine footers I have passed in my life, I have passed for the first time in the last month.

30
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:46,689
Rym: The majority of them, in fact.

31
00:01:48,511 --> 00:02:00,510
Rym: But the reason I chose nine feet is actually a reason you would appreciate, uh, up until eighth mix DDR dance, dance revolution for you kids who've never heard of this, has a foot rating from one to nine.

32
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,190
Rym: And nine was the maximum difficulty.

33
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:11,550
Rym: Like when we were playing DDR at RIT, Scott and I got to the point we could do seven footers like reliably, like, like no chance of failure.

34
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,409
Rym: That's like music.

35
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:12,834
Rym: Like.

36
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,008
Rym: that's about the level we were at.

37
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,207
Rym: Eight footers were the hard songs and nine footers were like the Orion dot 78 bullshit.

38
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,569
Rym: I could barely pass most nine footers that I could even pass back then.

39
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:32,009
Rym: But I picked nine feet because that was the maximum difficulty of DDR until max 300 appeared in six mix.

40
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:33,629
Rym: That was the first 10 footer.

41
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,530
Rym: And up until eighth mix, there were only a few 10 footers and 10 footer basically just men.

42
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,870
Rym: These are the weird, special bullshit songs.

43
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:51,630
Scott: I mean, I always enjoyed that those existed, but I like, I didn't play DDR to play the, you know, I just never interested in like, you know, raising the difficulty level.

44
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,178
Rym: It's like, oh, I never wanted, it was always like a sticker ad.

45
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:03,750
Scott: If I saw other people trying it, you know, it's like, I played songs and it's like, okay, this song doesn't have enough arrows to even be interesting.

46
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,230
Scott: I'm like going step step, right?

47
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,247
Rym: And then it's silent Hill, the Christmas song basic.

48
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:12,790
Scott: And I guess, you know, judging by the fourth mix measurement, right?

49
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:20,630
Scott: The harder trick, easier maniac songs, like a six, seven foot, six, seven, eight is like the sweet spot of like super fun.

50
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,710
Scott: Sweet spot where there's enough arrows that it's interesting.

51
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,990
Scott: It's still challenging, but you're, you're can still dance.

52
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,088
Scott: You're not just sort of like, right.

53
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:31,846
Scott: You know?

54
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:39,930
Scott: And it's, you know, it's like, yeah, there were some harder ones that I could do, you know, but it's like, I just, it wasn't fun to do those.

55
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:46,630
Scott: Cause it became a, you know, not only was it harder, but it was actually a different game at that level, right?

56
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:47,569
Scott: It wasn't the same.

57
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:51,490
Scott: You know, it's like, no longer is it about right.

58
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,950
Scott: It's about something different.

59
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:54,770
Scott: You know, it's not just like straight.

60
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,890
Rym: We would get like that's the seven footer, the same game, just harder.

61
00:03:58,596 --> 00:03:58,807
Scott: Yeah.

62
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:03,072
Rym: Like most of how we played DDR was, Hey, let's do this song and have fun and try to show off.

63
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:05,950
Rym: and Hey, I'm going to try to do a spin like that kind of nonsense.

64
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:15,250
Rym: But so as of now, I have passed every song on DDR on every difficulty through up to eight feet all the way through the end of seventh mix.

65
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,326
Rym: And I'm halfway through eighth mix.

66
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:26,487
Rym: Uh, nine feet, uh, I have two nine footers to go in six mix and I currently can not pass either of them.

67
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,290
Rym: Uh, one of them I'm real close to passing.

68
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,570
Rym: It's one of the weird orions.

69
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,249
Rym: Like if I try it one more time, I'll pass it.

70
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,930
Rym: But flash in the night, the fuck that song is weirdly hard for a nine footer.

71
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,248
Rym: Like compared to any other nine footer I've ever seen.

72
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,869
Scott: I haven't heard of that one.

73
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:43,130
Rym: It's a six mix song.

74
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:48,486
Rym: You probably only ever saw it at, uh, remember there was a six mix machine at the bowling alley.

75
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,488
Scott: I played six mix a few times because I was the machine, the head of the bowling alley.

76
00:04:54,331 --> 00:05:00,110
Rym: But, uh, the things, I guess the things I've noticed is I have added some techniques now to my repertoire that I never did before.

77
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:07,109
Rym: Like rocking a foot between heel and toad and Nintendo foot because 40 year old Rym cannot mash his foot that fast.

78
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:08,249
Rym: Like directly.

79
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,029
Scott: I got, I wasn't a fan of arrows that made me do that.

80
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:17,987
Rym: Yeah, but I also noticed that I can do seven footers without dancing adjacent, but it's that kind of stuff.

81
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:22,530
Rym: But, uh, yeah, this is actually a super fun thing that's pretty low effort.

82
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:32,430
Rym: And my goal is just to be able to pass every song that existed in the ecosystem of DDR that existed up until like after eighth mix.

83
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,610
Rym: Like when we really weren't paying attention to DDR anymore.

84
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:41,570
Scott: Well, I'm spending my time doing a lot of reading because it's cold outside and I don't have to read the tale again anymore.

85
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,429
Scott: So I read and I'm reading all kinds of stuff and I'm reading it way faster.

86
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,564
Scott: It's like, oh, yes, reading words.

87
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:54,189
Rym: Well, it's not because it's the words were written in the past few decades.

88
00:05:55,491 --> 00:06:02,670
Rym: There's it's like the difference between when we read Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey versus the last time before that that I read the Odyssey.

89
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:03,836
Rym: It is the actual.

90
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:05,949
Scott: how to say it is difficult to read.

91
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:08,470
Scott: Well, not the actual Odyssey in Greek.

92
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:09,273
Scott: No,

93
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,661
Rym: I mean, I know some translation

94
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:11,862
Scott: who

95
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:22,230
Rym: have read that thing in Greek and I know a guy at work who can recite it in Greek because that's a thing that a lot of people in the UK just do as part of college is learn enough ancient Greek to read the classics.

96
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,229
Rym: So there's a guy at work who literally can recite the Odyssey in Greek, mostly from memory.

97
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:27,769
Scott: Uh huh.

98
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,850
Rym: He's still like, pull this out and just do it at a party.

99
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,048
Rym: Like I've seen him do it.

100
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,067
Scott: That's that guy.

101
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,450
Rym: I know that's the Odyssey guy.

102
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:51,029
Rym: Hey, that's like two steps above the person who you see very, like, very ostentatiously like making the mouth movements of the soliloquies when they're watching Shakespeare to make sure everyone around them knows that they memorized it.

103
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:52,067
Scott: That's you.

104
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,629
Rym: That is not me.

105
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:57,450
Rym: I know I know two soliloquies from Shakespeare still.

106
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,750
Scott: That's two more than anyone who's not that guy knows.

107
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:06,990
Rym: Yeah, that's just because I played those parts in high school in like dump ass productions of Hamlet and Macbeth.

108
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,670
Scott: You were in dump had more dump ass productions than anyone who's not that guy.

109
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,590
Rym: That was that you realized that was required in AP English.

110
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,107
Rym: You had to perform in the in the Shakespeare stuff.

111
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:19,345
Scott: Okay.

112
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:20,387
Rym: Unless you got a note.

113
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:24,970
Rym: Yeah, I played, I played, I played Laertes once.

114
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,180
Rym: I played, I did.

115
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:31,090
Rym: I get to get to get to be actual Macbeth once, which was annoying.

116
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,549
Rym: Anyway, got any news?

117
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:36,780
Scott: Uh, do we have?

118
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:37,930
Rym: I got a bunch of news.

119
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:39,729
Rym: Did you not actually come up with the news?

120
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:41,349
Rym: Do I have to go through all mine in a row?

121
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:42,699
Scott: Is there anything?

122
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:43,730
Rym: I don't think you sent me a link?

123
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,705
Rym: I don't think you had a news.

124
00:07:45,737 --> 00:07:46,390
Scott: I think I forgot.

125
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:49,429
Rym: I ain't stopping the show is about.

126
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:51,589
Scott: Let's go see what's what's going on.

127
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,249
Rym: Cause I got it.

128
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,149
Rym: I'll start with a few.

129
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:03,949
Rym: So, uh, this is, this is something that is important, but it's also not something that is like as scientific as some people make it out to be.

130
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,729
Rym: But it's something that I think people should pay attention to.

131
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:15,679
Rym: Partly because I started to realize just talking about this and poking at it recently because it made the news again, that a lot of younger people sort of lost the context for what this is.

132
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:18,349
Rym: The thing I'm talking about is the doomsday clock.

133
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:25,128
Rym: The doomsday clock has existed for a long time and it actually was invented and publicized during the cold war.

134
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:37,197
Rym: The goal of it, uh, was to have a, a pseudo objective, but mostly qualitative measure, agreed upon by a body of experts.

135
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:49,010
Rym: that is roughly just an analogy or a arbitrary metric, like a baseline to say, how close is humanity to destroying itself by its own hands?

136
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,609
Rym: Like, are we close to doing this?

137
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,729
Rym: Have we backed away from doing this?

138
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,930
Rym: Like what's a relative measure of the danger of humans to themselves on a global scale?

139
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,126
Rym: Like that's the intent of it.

140
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:08,988
Rym: And it really existed to highlight the fact that nuclear weapons for the second time in human history, cause I have a point to make here.

141
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:17,708
Rym: Where, where there was a second time humans made something that we could theoretically destroy our entire society with if we chose to.

142
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:24,288
Rym: I say second time because fossil fuel and the way we use cars is the first time.

143
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,569
Rym: we just didn't recognize the danger of that at the time.

144
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:30,450
Scott: And no one recognizes the slow roll.

145
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,026
Rym: Yeah.

146
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:41,749
Rym: Like nuclear weapons, uh, the doomsday clock was cool, was less close to destruction of during at any point in the cold war than it is now.

147
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:49,310
Rym: And it is where it is now primarily due to climate change and the global rise of fascism and the dysfunction of global governments.

148
00:09:51,170 --> 00:10:10,486
Rym: We are so among experts who's basically entire professional identities are around thinking about existential crises to humanity from our own hands have agreed pretty much unilaterally that climate change is a bigger risk to humans than nuclear weapons ever were at any point and likely ever will be.

149
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,950
Scott: That is obvious to people, but also nuclear weapons are still a threat.

150
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:25,350
Rym: Nuclear weapons are not less of a threat, but we are closer to crisis due to climate change than we are due to nuclear weapons.

151
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,530
Scott: In fact, there could be many, you know, uh, combinations of the two, right?

152
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:32,070
Scott: You know, some, you know, are the three, right?

153
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:43,869
Scott: Some, uh, you know, uh, dilapidated government somewhere here that has nuclear weapons and is being, you know, ravaged by climate crisis might end up using them.

154
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:52,810
Scott: If it's a strong government that is in good shape and isn't facing crisis, I mean, it's less likely to news.

155
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:59,490
Rym: I'm not going to talk about just because, uh, it's moving rapidly and you should just read the real news about this and we'll talk about it later.

156
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:08,370
Rym: But, uh, there is a, there is a very significant likelihood there will be war in Europe with Russia and Ukraine in the nearing future.

157
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,449
Scott: I don't know why Russia wants to invade Ukraine so bad.

158
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,330
Scott: Uh, one thing I don't understand.

159
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,025
Scott: Just let it go.

160
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,529
Rym: A light, a light stroll to Wikipedia actually answers that question pretty directly.

161
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:20,808
Scott: Uh, just let it go.

162
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:29,770
Rym: But, uh, to agree, you are making an obvious smart point, but, uh, same thing with China and all those islands.

163
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,327
Scott: Let them go.

164
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,910
Rym: Just like what Emily, I talk about politics.

165
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,299
Rym: Like, yeah, everything you're saying is 100% to 100% reasonable objectively.

166
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:49,170
Rym: Like people aren't reasonable, but the people in the position of making decisions here have different motives and their motives are stupid and evil and wrong.

167
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,450
Scott: Yeah, that's the funny, you know, it doesn't mean, you know, there's no point in focusing on the, you know, solving the new thing, right?

168
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,450
Scott: Or the climate change thing.

169
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:17,350
Rym: We need to solve the, some people are real bad, but, uh, you know, so to give you some perspective, because the, the, the clock was kept at 100 seconds to midnight, which is the closest it's ever been to the theoretical destruction of human society by human hands.

170
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:23,930
Rym: Uh, and it moved there actually pretty recently and it basically, they're keeping it there.

171
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,890
Rym: Uh, the least close to doom it ever was, was during the fall of the Soviet Union.

172
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:36,730
Rym: And then it rapidly started ticking back up because the states that emerged out of that crisis were basically hyper capitalist, uh, disaster states.

173
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:44,890
Rym: But anyway, I highly recommend you go read about why the clock was set to 100 seconds to midnight recently.

174
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:58,109
Rym: And I just point out that one of the people who spoke at the, uh, the ceremony, because this has been going on for 75 years, uh, was Hank Green, the V of the vlogger guy, the YouTube, the YouTube guy, the YouTube guy.

175
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:00,870
Rym: Uh, he's actually pretty close to this organization.

176
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:05,050
Rym: Uh, and I'll just, as you know, I, I'm a fan of the, the green brothers.

177
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,230
Rym: I have been pretty much from the beginning.

178
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:13,494
Rym: Like, I just love those two, but Hank is really like grown as the one I paid the most attention to.

179
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,229
Rym: And I really like, he's very insightful and I like what he has to say.

180
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:21,428
Rym: And I think you will be interested in what he had to say about why the doomsday clock is set, where it's set.

181
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:26,240
Rym: Was that enough time for you to come up with the news or I got to keep going?

182
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:28,820
Scott: No, I didn't really see anything that interesting.

183
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,699
Rym: So I got another little news.

184
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,180
Rym: Uh, it's one of those things that's not news to anyone, but it is always valuable to look at case studies.

185
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:49,940
Rym: If there's something you care about, like look at individual actual concrete, non hypothetical examples of something you're mad about or interested in, uh, independent of looking at actual data about behavior and aggregate.

186
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:58,640
Rym: So this is a story on vice, really short, really simple, but it's journalism in that it follows a handful of gaming NFTs.

187
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:03,840
Rym: Uh, specifically like, like it follows like who bought these things?

188
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:05,179
Rym: What happened to them?

189
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,899
Rym: Like, let's talk to the person who owns it to see what their deal is.

190
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:25,680
Rym: And it is fascinating because the story here seems to be the people they talk to who actually for real have an NFT and are not just an NFT scammer selling NFTs kind of bottom out of vague curiosity at best.

191
00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:29,639
Rym: Don't give a shit about NFTs, barely understand them.

192
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:38,679
Rym: And like it is the most interesting one was the person who bought one because they were themselves doing journalism on what it's like to buy one.

193
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:40,099
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,440
Scott: I mean, this isn't anything new.

195
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,700
Scott: We talk about this all the time.

196
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:54,500
Scott: That's how, you know, we're the kind of people where any decision we make in life, even the simplest thing, like I'm going to go to the grocery store and buy some fucking, I don't know, uh, dishwashing detergent.

197
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:54,920
Rym: Oh yeah.

198
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:03,399
Rym: That's me and Scott spending like hours reading about different chemicals in dishwashing detergents, trying to figure out which brands are all actually the same brand.

199
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:15,319
Scott: Like trying to find, trying to find a bootleg access to consumer reports, figuring out, you know, the tabs, the powder, the liquid with, you know, which with our, our type of dishwasher, which mode to use, what, you know, it's all.

200
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,860
Rym: There is a, there is a, there's a, there's a YouTube video that goes deep into how you got to use that.

201
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,140
Scott: I'm aware of, I've seen the same YouTube video.

202
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,220
Rym: Did you see the followup that had several retractions and updates?

203
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:26,940
Rym: That's even longer.

204
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,679
Scott: I mean, which of the several followers?

205
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:37,719
Scott: Anyway, the point is we're the kind of people we think really hard about everything, you know, and we, you know, we research and whatnot.

206
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,718
Scott: A lot of people just sort of coast through life, right?

207
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:44,520
Scott: You're not thinking too hard, right?

208
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,980
Scott: It's like, you know, if they need to buy some pad of paper, right?

209
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,460
Scott: They'll just go to Staples or a drug store and just grab the cheapest one.

210
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:57,120
Scott: Whereas I'm like, what's the nicest paper?

211
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,560
Scott: What kind of pen do I have?

212
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,040
Scott: What do I should get the lines?

213
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,180
Rym: How far apart should I even need a pen or paper?

214
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,119
Rym: Like, do I, do I really actually need this?

215
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:11,560
Rym: A lot of my research when I think I'm buying anything is, do I need a thing to solve this problem at all?

216
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:12,580
Scott: Right.

217
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,080
Scott: And not even just buying things, just doing things, right?

218
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:16,480
Scott: Ah, I have to cut up this onion.

219
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,420
Scott: What cutting technique should I use?

220
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:21,780
Scott: Which, which of the knives I already bought should I be using?

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,060
Scott: What, you know, it's like techniques, you know, all these things.

222
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
Scott: We're thinking really hard.

223
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:34,880
Scott: And even if we're not thinking hard about a particular problem we have right now, I just constantly read things all over all the time.

224
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:42,258
Scott: I spend most of my time just reading things all over and learning techniques, information about things.

225
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,779
Scott: So I think most people don't do that or don't do it to the same extent that I do.

226
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:55,359
Scott: Now, therefore it's like, if they open, they're playing a video game, they open it up and it says, Hey, buy this NFT skin.

227
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:56,879
Scott: It's like, all right.

228
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,280
Scott: You know, they're the kind of person who doesn't think too hard about that then.

229
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,319
Scott: And they got money and they want the thing.

230
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:04,977
Scott: Okay.

231
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,290
Scott: Yeah.

232
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:06,155
Scott: They just do it.

233
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:06,740
Scott: All right.

234
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:12,536
Scott: You know, they're not like necessarily an NFT believer or, you know, something like that.

235
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,093
Scott: They might be.

236
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,539
Scott: Um, but it's like, they're just going along with life.

237
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:21,780
Rym: Not, you know, but it's also, I mean, not that everyone does that for everything.

238
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,799
Rym: Like for all the research I do for like, there's a certain type of purchase.

239
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:25,316
Scott: I do.

240
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,000
Scott: I don't think there's anything I don't like in terms of anything I do in life.

241
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,280
Scott: I think I've researched the techniques and equipment.

242
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:42,739
Rym: But in terms of there, there are classes of completely fungible consumer products where I literally do not care and buy whatever the generic option is.

243
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:50,362
Scott: But that is such a, I think the it's, if anything in my life that I don't like heavily research.

244
00:17:50,543 --> 00:18:02,900
Scott: the right way or the best way of doing a thing is, uh, or like any, like even minor life decisions or major ones, the only times I don't do extensive research investigation.

245
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,720
Rym: I'll give you an example.

246
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,340
Rym: I bought a battery for my car.

247
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,620
Rym: I did zero research.

248
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,780
Rym: I just bought an equity, the cheapest battery from a brand that appeared to be a real brand.

249
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:20,100
Scott: that was the only time I don't do that is if it's something I've decided I'm just not going to do that way.

250
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,520
Scott: I don't have to, you know, it doesn't matter what choice.

251
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,000
Scott: Cause I just, I chose not to, but, uh, it's really funny.

252
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,860
Scott: I do have a goal of just, you know, minimizing life, right?

253
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,178
Scott: Do as few things as possible.

254
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:35,640
Rym: But at least in the NFTs, like fake space where, you know, NFTs are just a scam.

255
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,046
Rym: It is the media.

256
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:51,139
Rym: like landscape around NFTs acts like they're a thing because the most of the conversation about NFTs are from the people who are running NFT scams and Astro turfing everywhere they can Astro turf.

257
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:59,200
Scott: But I mean, a large, a large part of media is not at, you know, a very small part of media is journalists who think hard about a thing.

258
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:12,019
Scott: And even if they do think hard about a thing, they write about the thing from within its own context and not, you know, I think about almost everything I ever encountered, like case in point, I consider it with a global context.

259
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:24,920
Rym: Like a good journalist would literally point out that the Republican party in America is engaged in fascist voter suppression, but no, they're going to talk about them as somehow being an equal entity to other political parties.

260
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:29,560
Rym: And they're going to have this very neutral, simplistic, like dialogue about it.

261
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,740
Scott: That's not about shrinking the context.

262
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,283
Scott: That's just.

263
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:34,080
Scott: that's just about being wrong.

264
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:45,920
Scott: But it's like I'm talking about, like, you know, someone might be discussing like a game and they talk about it within, you know, these with these assumptions already existing, right?

265
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:52,120
Scott: Like, you know, whereas I'm going to look at like, OK, you're playing this game in the world, right on Earth.

266
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,940
Scott: And the only assumption I have is the conservation of matter and energy.

267
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:01,220
Rym: So the listener pointed out your extensive research.

268
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:11,599
Rym: Does this apply to decisions you make in games, which I know that you often do not do any research on how, say, work arts work in civilization sex?

269
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:15,158
Scott: Oh, well, that's just because it's a pain, too much of a pain in the ass.

270
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:22,760
Scott: But no, I'd also don't like it when I am unable to do the right.

271
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,120
Scott: I don't enjoy the games that require too much research into useless minutia.

272
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,920
Rym: So so in one last news, you can watch it if you want to.

273
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:35,840
Rym: It's 11, almost 12 hours long because they tried their best.

274
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:45,840
Rym: So last night, the Democratic Party of the US basically forced the issue through a somewhat complicated and weird Senate procedure to force a floor vote.

275
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:53,279
Rym: Basically, in the Senate, you can't like force a vote without weird shenanigans because of how broken that chamber of the American government is.

276
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:04,139
Rym: So because, you know, we need to pass voting rights legislation or huge numbers of non white people basically lose access to the vote in the United States, mostly in Republican controlled states.

277
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:05,540
Rym: This is all common knowledge.

278
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:16,000
Rym: But one of the avenues, one of the few avenues we have to stop this is to pass a specific bill in our Senate, which has passed our house and is ready to be signed by our president.

279
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:27,179
Rym: And because of the obscure rules of the Senate, basically you need 51 people to vote to proceed or the bill is just dead.

280
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:32,800
Rym: And basically what the Democrats did is pull the shenanigans to actually force that vote.

281
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:37,780
Rym: Up until this point, nobody actually had to say they were against the voting rights.

282
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:42,965
Rym: They only had to just not show up, let the filibuster happen and kind of get away with it.

283
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:52,880
Rym: So they basically exercised their final power to make it clear that there is no possible way to pass a bill like this via legal channels in the Senate.

284
00:21:53,241 --> 00:22:01,540
Rym: Whatever we do about the 2022 elections, there is no way to solve it via the existing Democratic process in the United States Federal Congress.

285
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,019
Rym: They forced the issue.

286
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,359
Scott: Following the rules that exist, yeah?

287
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:09,158
Rym: Yeah, well, the rules that exist can only be changed by the exact same vote of that body.

288
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,700
Scott: But I mean, you only need to change the rules if you've already decided to follow them.

289
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:22,206
Rym: Yeah, I don't think there's any world where the Senate just passes a bill not following Senate rules.

290
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:23,580
Rym: that somehow becomes law.

291
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,140
Scott: I'm just saying you only have to change rules if you already have decided to follow rules.

292
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,718
Scott: If you're not following rules, doesn't matter what the rules are.

293
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:34,600
Rym: So this is the interesting thing.

294
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:42,240
Rym: It's worth watching the end of it, because what is interesting is that they basically went as hard as possible in the actual debate.

295
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:51,540
Rym: And it was one of the first times in my life I've seen an actual, serious, no punches are pulled, real discussion of an issue like this.

296
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:58,797
Rym: Like they went as hard as you can imagine going and they made extremely succinct, simple points.

297
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,198
Rym: They made it very clear that the vote is literally just to protect the voting rights of non-white people.

298
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,040
Rym: And 52 senators said, yeah, fuck that.

299
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:09,320
Rym: I'm going to vote no on the record.

300
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:09,777
Rym: Fuck you.

301
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,175
Rym: It's over.

302
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,080
Scott: Yeah, that's, you know, because they're bad people.

303
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:13,560
Rym: Yep.

304
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,920
Scott: So nothing was learned or gained.

305
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:22,079
Rym: No, actually, one thing was learned because this is actually something that's moderately important.

306
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:42,340
Rym: A big, false and honestly ridiculous argument that a lot of leftists and progressives in America have been making in public channels and even pundits have been making is they try to make a case that even if you got these two shitbag, like, traitor senators to vote on this bill, other Democrats wouldn't let this filibuster go away.

307
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,199
Rym: Like there's other people.

308
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,078
Scott: That's not true at all.

309
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:45,499
Scott: It's just two shitbags.

310
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:46,539
Scott: We know that.

311
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,479
Rym: No one could prove that.

312
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:49,819
Rym: No one believed that.

313
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,879
Scott: You know, in case you weren't on the same page that we've been on.

314
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,640
Rym: If you believe that ridiculous talking point, that's what happened.

315
00:23:57,285 --> 00:23:59,180
Scott: I never I haven't heard of anyone who said that.

316
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:01,620
Scott: But that is extremely widespread, Scott.

317
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,318
Rym: Even among some of our friends, it is.

318
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,540
Scott: Well, if you didn't realize it was just two shitbags holding up the entire country.

319
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,456
Scott: Now, you know.

320
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:09,832
Rym: Yep.

321
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:10,559
Rym: But it is.

322
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,499
Rym: But that argument is absolutely false because 48 Democrats voted right then and there to end the filibuster.

323
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:26,220
Rym: It would have happened instantly if these two shitbags or if any two Republican senators who are also shitbags had voted.

324
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:33,960
Rym: So fifty two human beings who represent roughly twenty five percent of the American population have an absolute veto on all legislation.

325
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:43,580
Rym: And forty eight senators representing a actually terrifyingly small percentage, terrifyingly large percentage of the population have zero recourse.

326
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:46,540
Scott: And nothing new was learned or gained.

327
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,780
Rym: The thing we just said was learned because a lot of people.

328
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,460
Scott: Well, I guess someone needed to learn that, but nothing new was learned.

329
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:59,939
Rym: I guess the point is a scary number of people needed to learn that there are actually 48 senators willing to overturn the filibuster for this.

330
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,799
Scott: I think the only thing that was gained is that you made all those old white guys sit there for that many hours.

331
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,460
Rym: The only possible thing that Democrats could do now in the Senate is something that they started to do last night.

332
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,140
Rym: My wonder is the threat or whatever.

333
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,040
Rym: But there is one other thing is kind of obscure.

334
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:17,540
Rym: There is the concept of a reverse filibuster.

335
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:20,772
Rym: It was used in like 2003 by the Republicans once.

336
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,608
Rym: I don't know of any other instance of it happening, but basically what you do is you bring a bill to the floor, OK?

337
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:30,879
Rym: You vote to make it pass.

338
00:25:31,741 --> 00:25:35,660
Rym: The Republicans then filibuster filibuster you at the last second.

339
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,640
Rym: You make sure that your majority leader votes last.

340
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:39,099
Rym: You vote no against your own bill.

341
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,931
Rym: So it gets pulled from the floor without like.

342
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:44,899
Rym: if you vote yes for it and it fails, you can't bring it back to the floor.

343
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:49,036
Rym: But if you vote no and pull it from the floor, you can theoretically bring it back to the floor.

344
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,379
Rym: So you bring it to the floor.

345
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:51,878
Rym: All the votes come in.

346
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:54,439
Rym: If it didn't pass, you vote against it.

347
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,579
Rym: Bring it back from the floor.

348
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,577
Rym: You immediately raise a point of order and bring it back to the fucking floor and you start over.

349
00:26:01,021 --> 00:26:04,960
Scott: OK, so but they're happy to do that because that what does that get you?

350
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,560
Scott: They don't want anything to pass ever.

351
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:12,519
Scott: So if you keep doing that and you keep repeating it, so I think they'll get what they want, which is you just write this.

352
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:20,540
Rym: You can do one thing because the thing the reason the filibuster is so broken in America is that for most of its history, it was a talking filibuster.

353
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,075
Rym: If you wanted to filibuster something, you had to actually stand up there and piss your pants.

354
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,400
Rym: Keep talking.

355
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,118
Rym: Read the phone book.

356
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:30,360
Rym: So when they change that rule, you can do nothing and filibuster.

357
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,620
Rym: Filibusters are just automatic.

358
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:39,399
Rym: The thing you could do with the reverse filibuster is force all those old men to sit there and they literally cannot leave.

359
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:46,679
Rym: If once you start this process, if they leave, the bill passes, they would be forced to sit there and wait you out.

360
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:51,420
Rym: And you could force a ridiculous public spectacle and also block all other Senate business.

361
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,459
Rym: That's basically the last holy grail.

362
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:02,978
Scott: Problem is, is you still need even if you, you know, OK, you avoided this filibuster thing and now you're actually voting on the bill itself, whether it will become law.

363
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:08,160
Scott: You still need 50 votes and a tiebreaker to pass the law.

364
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:09,439
Rym: Which could happen.

365
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,000
Scott: But do you think the two shit bags who are going to vote for the law?

366
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,249
Rym: So it's like there's more complication.

367
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:22,980
Rym: I'm skipping, but I think one of those two shit bags could be brought enough to ship.

368
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:30,118
Rym: The problem is one of them seems to just be a plant like she is just like working with Republicans openly at this point.

369
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:35,040
Scott: So so it won't really matter even if you get past the filibuster and then.

370
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:35,920
Scott: Right.

371
00:27:36,242 --> 00:27:39,360
Scott: OK, let's say you get this thing past the filibuster.

372
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,338
Scott: You pass this law.

373
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:41,220
Rym: It's instantly law.

374
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,280
Rym: Biden signs it that day.

375
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,128
Rym: He has said as much.

376
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:44,340
Scott: that is true.

377
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,239
Rym: Already passed the House.

378
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:46,599
Scott: That's true.

379
00:27:47,204 --> 00:27:48,259
Scott: Here's what's not true.

380
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,660
Rym: The Supreme Court could just overturn it immediately if they wanted.

381
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:54,239
Scott: Well, that but not overturn it.

382
00:27:54,501 --> 00:28:00,200
Scott: But OK, so some red state is still conducting voter suppression against the law.

383
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:00,759
Scott: Right.

384
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:06,220
Scott: You have to now sue that state in a court and then you have to fight in the court.

385
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,398
Scott: And then even if the.

386
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,600
Rym: Oh, do you actually know what's in the John Lewis voting?

387
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:18,559
Rym: That voting rights act is watertight, trivial to enforce, almost impossible to pull up into the courts or the Supreme Court.

388
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:20,759
Rym: And more importantly, you know what it does.

389
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:28,199
Rym: It basically gives the Department of Justice, which is way less constrained by rules than Congress, the ability to enforce.

390
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:35,055
Scott: Yeah, you know, you're definitely going to get some enforcement, but, you know, it's not.

391
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,471
Rym: Also, honestly, we really only need this bill for a couple of swing states for the short term.

392
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:43,120
Rym: Like it only needs to really be enforced in like Georgia and a couple other places.

393
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:48,079
Scott: Well, yeah, because I mean, it doesn't matter if that, you know, OK, voter suppress all you want in Utah.

394
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,153
Rym: It's the West Virginia is 98 percent white.

395
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,440
Rym: No statewide election goes toward the Democrats in that state under any circumstances.

396
00:28:56,461 --> 00:29:00,979
Rym: But the other new piece of information that we get to the rest of the show, that's actually very important.

397
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:08,280
Rym: There is a way forward if the Democrats hold the House in 2022, which is not impossible.

398
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:10,279
Scott: It seems unlikely.

399
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:20,820
Rym: It's less unlikely than it was a few weeks ago because the gerrymandering the Republicans were doing wasn't actually as effective as people expected because they're running out of room to gerrymander.

400
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:22,339
Rym: They've gerrymandered so much.

401
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,560
Scott: The only hope that I have is enough Republicans died of covid.

402
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,157
Scott: That's my hope.

403
00:29:29,364 --> 00:29:31,079
Rym: I was I was actually about to bring that up.

404
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,978
Rym: That is what I look.

405
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,000
Scott: But I did some cursory research on that at one point.

406
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:38,258
Scott: I was like, all right, how many people died of covid in Florida?

407
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:38,620
Scott: total?

408
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:40,160
Rym: Oh, no, you don't need Florida.

409
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,759
Scott: Where the margins on like, you know, I looked at them.

410
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,940
Rym: I don't even need Florida.

411
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,820
Rym: All that matters is like Arizona, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin.

412
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:50,600
Scott: I think I looked at also at like Texas.

413
00:29:51,321 --> 00:29:51,803
Scott: But it's like.

414
00:29:52,284 --> 00:30:03,520
Scott: even it was like even if every person who died of covid in Florida was a Republican and all, you know, it's like it wasn't enough to make up the margins on any of the statewide elections.

415
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:06,360
Scott: So I don't think that's going to remember.

416
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,000
Rym: All we have to do theoretically is win what we like, win things that like things we've won very recently.

417
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:13,280
Rym: It's not impossible.

418
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,940
Rym: It's actually it's plausible.

419
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:20,600
Rym: But mostly Republican seats are up for election in the Senate in twenty twenty two.

420
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:33,559
Rym: Very few Democrats are up, meaning they're mostly playing defense because forty eight senators, none of whom are likely to lose their seats, are have voted yes for this and would vote yes for it again.

421
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:37,034
Rym: If we pick up even two seats, we can immediately pass this bill.

422
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:39,477
Rym: if we hold if we hold the House by even one seat.

423
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,199
Scott: Well, which two seats do you think you're going to get?

424
00:30:42,662 --> 00:30:44,775
Rym: There are several that I think talking about.

425
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:45,700
Rym: that's out of scope for the show.

426
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,280
Rym: You could join us in the angry politics section of the discard board.

427
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,500
Rym: We're talking about this constantly.

428
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,920
Scott: Yeah, no, there's no, but I'm saying I don't know what you're talking about.

429
00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:58,400
Scott: To simultaneously talk about a hopeless and free to serve.

430
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,800
Rym: Picking up two Senate seats makes it actually for real possible to pass this bill.

431
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,360
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

432
00:31:12,481 --> 00:31:13,679
Rym: So check this out.

433
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:19,040
Rym: This I found this video as part of a conversation I was having about old commercials.

434
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:30,120
Rym: And this is a compilation of a bunch of commercials for dot com companies during the late 90s, early 2000s dot com boom, which was like Mike.

435
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,540
Rym: That was like Scott and I were already nerds.

436
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:37,614
Rym: And this was like before the Internet existed.

437
00:31:37,654 --> 00:31:40,892
Rym: in the way that you know today, like this is Web 1.0 Internet ads.

438
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:43,239
Rym: Mm hmm.

439
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:45,139
Scott: It is paperweight paperweight style.

440
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,360
Rym: Yeah, it is amazing.

441
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:56,160
Rym: Like just what some of these are selling, especially when you see screenshots of what websites look like back then, like I know what websites look like back then.

442
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,339
Scott: I made those websites and use those websites.

443
00:31:58,561 --> 00:31:59,920
Rym: Yeah, I made and use those websites.

444
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:07,563
Rym: This was an era when most online shopping meant mail a check or money order in the via the U.S.

445
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:11,620
Rym: post office to a company after you bought something on their website.

446
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:17,580
Scott: Or type your credit card number into an unencrypted Web form and make an HDTV post.

447
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,147
Rym: Yep.

448
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,519
Rym: Very few websites could accept credit cards back then.

449
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,758
Rym: Very few.

450
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,800
Scott: And they weren't accepting them the way they are now, where like a transaction happens.

451
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:35,998
Scott: You were basically just posting and then it was going into a database or a file and someone at the other end would then look in that file and then process your order manually.

452
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,320
Scott: It'd be like it'd be like if I sent you an email with my credit card number and said, I'd like two pizzas, please.

453
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,479
Scott: And then someone opened the email, looked at it, then charged my card using their point of sale system and then started making the pizzas.

454
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,420
Rym: That is, I'm pretty sure how that one experimental online pizza delivery website at RIT worked.

455
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,240
Scott: I mean, I worked at broa.com for many years before that, before I got there.

456
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,380
Scott: Well, before I got there.

457
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:20,420
Scott: But when that business was new in the late 90s, it was literally just email these two and they would run down physically to the theater and buy the tickets and then they would get your money and then you would show up to New York and then you'd come to the office and they'd give you the tickets from the safe that they bought.

458
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:26,938
Rym: So I just scrolled down and I saw the top YouTube comment on this video and it hit me right in the old.

459
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:28,459
Rym: I'm just going to read this.

460
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,480
Rym: It's one sentence quote.

461
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,680
Rym: I never knew Amazon was originally a book only website.

462
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:33,898
Scott: Yeah.

463
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,399
Scott: People don't know that they just sold books.

464
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:39,988
Scott: The first thing I ever bought on Amazon was a copy of catch 22 a book.

465
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:42,858
Rym: So what do you got?

466
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,579
Scott: What do I have?

467
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,500
Scott: So, uh, we love the go, the old factory videos, right?

468
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,964
Scott: Anytime you see the inside of a real factory making some, you know, common everyday goods, right?

469
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,500
Scott: Really fascinating stuff, really satisfying, especially a lot of the processes.

470
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:05,000
Scott: Here's one that is not just interesting for the process and how shockingly manual a lot of it is.

471
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,840
Scott: I think a lot more could be automated in this factory, even with my limited factory knowledge.

472
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:19,199
Scott: But what's really fascinating is just, you know, the, I guess, eco friendliness in this factory in South Korea where golf is pretty popular.

473
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:20,679
Scott: It's one of the golf playing nations.

474
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:29,279
Scott: They are taking old golf balls, which usually go to the driving range and then go to the mini golf and then go to the garbage.

475
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:29,958
Scott: Right.

476
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:34,319
Scott: And basically, if you think about a golf ball, it's like, yeah, you use it.

477
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:38,460
Scott: You know, and for like a round of golf, maybe you lose some in the woods, right?

478
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:39,239
Scott: And they're still good.

479
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,440
Scott: But if they don't lose them to the woods, they're not really good to use again.

480
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:51,780
Scott: The next game of golf, they've gotten beat up and damaged and whatnot, but it's only really the outside shell that's damaged from flexing and getting smacked.

481
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:59,957
Scott: The inside is largely just fine, um, you know, and could see a lot more use than the outside could see.

482
00:35:00,662 --> 00:35:03,860
Scott: And what they do in this video is they basically get old golf balls.

483
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:06,440
Scott: They cut the outside off and throw it away.

484
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:17,920
Scott: And then they make new outsides and they're reusing golf balls, which is very economic, ecologically good, not wasting so much plastic and rubber.

485
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:20,078
Scott: So that's pretty cool.

486
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:31,220
Rym: And in general, the the actual reality of how physical things and physical labor get done are way more important to society than the tech stuff that we're doing.

487
00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:41,740
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if all golf balls were, you know, made this way, like reused in this fashion, instead of just being thrown out or lost in the woods, that would probably have a pretty significant impact.

488
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,538
Rym: So in the moment, getting used to the book club book, The Tale of Genji, Scott has reached the end.

489
00:35:48,821 --> 00:35:51,410
Rym: I am rapidly already a third into.

490
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,380
Scott: I'm a 33 percent done with the next book club.

491
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,279
Rym: I feel like we'll do that next book club book inside of a couple of weeks tops after we finish this one.

492
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,500
Rym: But I'm steamrolling ahead.

493
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,799
Rym: I think Genji is about to die.

494
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,839
Scott: I feel like I think you are not that close to the end that you got a ways to go.

495
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,680
Rym: I think he's going to die like next chapter, which means you better read some more.

496
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,866
Rym: Well, that's the I know.

497
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:21,100
Rym: I know the historical context of the chapter chapters that follow at least more so than I know about the other part.

498
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,872
Scott: They are easier to read, but they are not.

499
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:25,979
Scott: you know, they're going to take you some time still.

500
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:26,400
Rym: Yeah.

501
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:35,340
Scott: But I also when I'm reading this book, I read it pretty fast, but partly because every time I read the chapter where Genji dies, that one's going to take you.

502
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,478
Scott: You're going to read that one real fast.

503
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:38,514
Rym: Oh, I looked ahead and I saw.

504
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:39,180
Rym: I saw that one.

505
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:40,939
Rym: I saw that chapter.

506
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:42,659
Rym: That's that's cool and clever.

507
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:47,500
Rym: Anyway, I also learned something about the chapters that come after that.

508
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,480
Rym: And there's a lot of debate over the intent around them.

509
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,020
Rym: There's even some debate around who wrote them, apparently.

510
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,974
Rym: You know.

511
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,582
Rym: Yeah, but also Genji is only like 40.

512
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:02,479
Scott: So people didn't live that long back then.

513
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:04,580
Rym: And Turnabout's fair play.

514
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,700
Rym: Some of the things that happened to Genji in the last few chapters are a lot like the things that Genji was doing to other people in earlier chapters.

515
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,178
Rym: You see the cycle there.

516
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:15,909
Rym: I got things to say about like the.

517
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:24,200
Rym: the structure of these books get more and more like modern novels the further you get into them as you see her clearly refining her technique.

518
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,880
Rym: And that's the thing that is standing out the most to me as I get near the end.

519
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,320
Scott: It's like reading a webcomic.

520
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,979
Scott: It gets better as the time goes on.

521
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:37,500
Rym: Like if you just grab the Tale of Genji and read one of the later chapters, you'll understand it a lot better than if you read like the second chapter.

522
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:45,440
Scott: And it's it's not just your understanding of it that improved because I went back and tried to read an earlier chapter and it was still hard to know.

523
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,500
Rym: There's a lot more context in the text.

524
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:51,720
Rym: There's a lot more like of the way we expect books to be written in the text.

525
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,420
Rym: It's it's fascinating.

526
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,580
Rym: That's I'm taking more away from that than I am from anything else in these books anyway.

527
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,780
Rym: Well, this book, these chapters anyway.

528
00:38:00,602 --> 00:38:01,679
Rym: So we'll be doing that.

529
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,659
Rym: We'll be finishing that show up in the next couple of weeks.

530
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:07,140
Rym: And then we'll be Steve Rollin ahead with a bunch of book club books.

531
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:08,280
Rym: And I have a pile of nonfiction.

532
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:10,299
Rym: I've been really, really itching to read.

533
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,898
Rym: Otherwise, PAX East.

534
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,900
Rym: Most likely the best is either us or likely just me.

535
00:38:20,261 --> 00:38:24,780
Rym: We'll be there for one day to do one or two panels like I did for PAX Unplugged.

536
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,499
Rym: I feel like that's the extent.

537
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:31,040
Rym: But Tracy, see if if he's going to do a panel, I'm going to a panel.

538
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,240
Rym: See if we can arrange them on the same day and maybe we'll do a panel together.

539
00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:33,918
Rym: If you don't want to go.

540
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,839
Scott: Not going to Boston just to do a panel.

541
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,499
Rym: I'll go to Boston.

542
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:44,359
Rym: I work in an industry where pre-COVID I would just go to Boston for the day, like kind of commonly as part of my job.

543
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,079
Rym: Like I'd literally just get up, get out in a cellar, go to Boston, work there all day and get out in a cellar home.

544
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,934
Scott: Yeah, no, not doing it.

545
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:52,079
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

546
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:53,900
Rym: April is later than other PAXes.

547
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,726
Rym: So I'm less hesitant about.

548
00:38:57,228 --> 00:39:01,980
Rym: I hope the COVID situation is way better in April than it is now.

549
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:22,460
Rym: But mostly having been to PAX Unplugged for a few hours, the thing I would be most worried about at a gaming con now is even if it was safe to go, I discovered what it's like to be at a table with four people trying to talk to each other in masks in a place that is as echoey and loud as a gaming space at a con like PAX East.

550
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:26,000
Rym: I don't think most people can understand each other well enough to play an RPG.

551
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:27,530
Scott: No.

552
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:28,819
Rym: Like that.

553
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,080
Scott: That isn't playing RPG under normal circumstances in a non-COVID time.

554
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,760
Rym: There is nothing obstructing the words coming out of my mouth.

555
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:43,599
Rym: Us playing an RPG at PAX East is us yelling at each other for hours at a table and constantly repeating ourselves.

556
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,460
Scott: You need the quiet room, right?

557
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,500
Scott: The quiet room is the way.

558
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:45,836
Scott: Yep.

559
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,260
Rym: And if we're going to just go to a hotel room, why even go to the con?

560
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,200
Rym: Let's just all meet in one of our apartments and play an RPG.

561
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,239
Scott: Yeah, why don't we do that?

562
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:54,178
Scott: Let's do that.

563
00:39:54,581 --> 00:40:00,159
Rym: I actually do want to start off that Blades in the Dark game in Queens like as soon as I unbubble again.

564
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,380
Scott: I want to play other games.

565
00:40:01,641 --> 00:40:02,519
Rym: Like what game do you want to play?

566
00:40:04,163 --> 00:40:07,180
Scott: I mean, I have a huge pile of indie tabletop RPG PDFs.

567
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,620
Scott: I want to play each one one time.

568
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,820
Scott: I'm not really interested in.

569
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:16,659
Rym: I'm honestly, right now, I'm mostly interested in taking a game I've never played and doing a full campaign to really explore it.

570
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,220
Scott: Full campaign means, you know, I got all these games.

571
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,580
Scott: Just eat the same burger every night?

572
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,760
Scott: It's like, I want to try everything.

573
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:25,920
Scott: I want to go to the buffet and feast upon all the different games.

574
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,500
Scott: And then maybe after I've tried all these different games, maybe then I'll be like, that one was the real good one.

575
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,519
Scott: Let's play a campaign of that.

576
00:40:31,882 --> 00:40:36,820
Rym: Thing is, I know, I know mostly how these games will go just from reading the rules and having a lot of experience with them.

577
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,039
Scott: I haven't even read the rules yet.

578
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:39,839
Rym: I did too.

579
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:49,038
Rym: I did stop reading the rules to indie RPGs that have come out in the past couple of years because I have read a lot of indie RPG rules over the years and not played those games yet.

580
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:50,360
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

581
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:52,820
Scott: I want to play all these games, one time each at least.

582
00:40:55,263 --> 00:41:01,993
Rym: I guess the thing I'm most interested in in RPGs, now that I've played a campaign for a while again, is that that is what I've always loved.

583
00:41:02,013 --> 00:41:05,599
Rym: the most about RPGs is playing long form, not the one offs.

584
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,020
Rym: The one offs are just like hollow appetizers compared to campaigns.

585
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Scott: Me, I don't really care for the campaign.

586
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:23,620
Rym: I mean, my whole life, most of the D&D I played, the vast majority of all role playing I've ever done in my life was from a grand total of five campaigns.

587
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,680
Scott: It's, you know, because with the campaign, it's always more of the same.

588
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:27,820
Scott: I need the novelty.

589
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:29,580
Scott: I want to try to explore the same.

590
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,699
Rym: You're doing different things.

591
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,440
Rym: We are taking out the Denver Sisters.

592
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:34,100
Scott: Okay, whatever.

593
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:36,420
Rym: Okay, I guess we will play RPGs.

594
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,839
Rym: I'll go run campaigns with everybody else.

595
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:42,360
Rym: Anyway, so greeting cards.

596
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:48,016
Rym: Yeah, we're going to do a bunch of shows on different kinds of cards, so stay tuned for that.

597
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,380
Scott: Well, I've wanted to do a YouTube series about cards.

598
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,280
Scott: I've had some, you know, but it's a project shit talk situation.

599
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:55,836
Rym: Oh, yeah.

600
00:41:56,544 --> 00:41:59,380
Rym: We thought about doing a meta show on GeekNights, and we just recently did one.

601
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:13,960
Rym: So greeting cards or just cards, the kind like Hallmark cards, the card you send to someone for an event based reason, like a birthday, a death, a graduation, a funeral.

602
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,939
Scott: It could also just be a greeting like, hi, I was thinking of you, you know, you also might not send it.

603
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,460
Scott: You might like tape it onto a gift or true, you know, hand it to someone.

604
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:32,360
Scott: These are especially in the US because I know that I don't know what the culture of greeting cards is in other countries.

605
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,700
Scott: They're very different everywhere.

606
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:40,639
Rym: I have encountered the equivalents from various countries over the years in my professional career, getting professional gifts.

607
00:42:41,341 --> 00:42:57,200
Rym: And yeah, I actually had like a coach at my old company who would like help us, help me and help us as a company respond to or proactively do whatever the equivalent culture is in the countries we were doing business in, because this culture is radically different everywhere.

608
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:08,160
Rym: So everything we're talking about is going to be primarily from a US-centric perspective because we're US-ians and really in the forum, like let us know what it's like in your country.

609
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,699
Rym: Like this is I am very interested in that.

610
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:11,679
Scott: I want to know.

611
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,118
Scott: But anyway, so in the US, when I was growing up, I don't know what the history was because I never researched it.

612
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,134
Scott: I'm sure I could look it up.

613
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:30,002
Scott: But when I was young, basically, if there was a special occasion, usually in accompanying a gift, but not always, not always, you would you would go and buy a card, which is either made by.

614
00:43:30,223 --> 00:43:39,700
Scott: there were basically two companies that sort of have Monopoly, American Greetings and Hallmark and American Greetings, made famous by Penny Arcade and Hallmark, made famous by capitalism.

615
00:43:40,382 --> 00:43:49,460
Scott: And you would go to either a Hallmark store that was like a store that just sold cards and gift shit or, you know, the grocery store, the drugstore.

616
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,240
Scott: They always had a section of them, you know, needed one quickly.

617
00:43:52,903 --> 00:43:54,639
Scott: And you'd you'd pick one out.

618
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:58,659
Scott: And there were all these licensing deals so you could get Snoopy's and Garfield's.

619
00:43:58,881 --> 00:43:59,440
Rym: It was organized.

620
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:03,560
Rym: And it was always like they were like literally organized by topic alphabetically.

621
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,980
Rym: So you're like funeral function, like you're just looking down the list until you find like 40th birthday.

622
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,699
Scott: That's the one.

623
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:11,300
Scott: But right.

624
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,460
Scott: So first it's by topic, but then it's by audience.

625
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:17,420
Scott: It's like, OK, birthday, but is an old person's birthday, a young person's birthday?

626
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,139
Scott: What gender is the person that you're giving the birthday card to?

627
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,740
Scott: Or a, you know, a gender neutral one.

628
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:25,479
Scott: Right.

629
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:31,140
Scott: Or, you know, is it is it gonna be a funny one or a serious one or a sentimental one?

630
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,980
Scott: Or, you know, every different flavor for each event was or circumstance was available.

631
00:44:37,346 --> 00:44:37,597
Scott: Right.

632
00:44:38,749 --> 00:44:39,077
Scott: And then.

633
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:39,820
Scott: Right.

634
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,880
Scott: That there was licensing deals and there were some that weren't licensed.

635
00:44:43,244 --> 00:44:44,598
Scott: Some of them had words in them.

636
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:45,294
Scott: Right.

637
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:45,561
Scott: Like.

638
00:44:45,702 --> 00:44:48,120
Scott: and some of them were just blank and you had to write your own words.

639
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,859
Scott: Some of the words are minimal, but you could add your own words in the other space.

640
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,320
Rym: So I don't know about you, but I at least, you know, we talked about this.

641
00:44:55,661 --> 00:44:58,060
Rym: We did all the shows around our childhoods in history.

642
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:02,200
Rym: I grew up in like like very young childhood Detroit.

643
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:21,499
Rym: But most of my like post kid brain childhood was in the most suburban suburbs to ever grace Midwestern suburbia like pop generic Americana and greeting card like cards like this were such a fixture of life.

644
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:31,440
Rym: And there were such like specific and simple rules about them that literally like kids would all almost even get the exact same card for their birthday.

645
00:45:31,784 --> 00:45:32,896
Rym: Like as time went on.

646
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,378
Scott: Like that's something I didn't notice until more, you know, maybe the past decade or decade and a half.

647
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:38,840
Scott: Right.

648
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,580
Scott: Is that the quality of cards and variety of cards back then was much lower.

649
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:44,857
Scott: Right.

650
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,440
Scott: Number one, making your own cards was like much more difficult back then.

651
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,440
Scott: You know, even if you had a printer, it wasn't a high quality printer.

652
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:55,820
Scott: You were using Microsoft Publisher and getting some clip art.

653
00:45:56,062 --> 00:45:56,860
Scott: You didn't have Photoshop.

654
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,047
Scott: Right.

655
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,819
Scott: You know, now anyone can make any card.

656
00:46:00,443 --> 00:46:02,060
Scott: So computers helped a lot.

657
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:17,518
Scott: There have been a lot of advances in terms of cutting machines that are available to industry as well as home people and basically just, you know, the technology of cards and also, you know, the art of cards, Hallmark and American greetings.

658
00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:18,240
Scott: Right.

659
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:24,300
Scott: We're only making cards and like a certain amount and a certain spread of ideas.

660
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:24,485
Scott: Right.

661
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,779
Scott: And they were really staying in their lane.

662
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:41,180
Scott: Whereas once that opened up to other companies, butting in the monopolies long over and people making their own cards, the range of expression on cards expanded, you know, massive.

663
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:53,819
Rym: I've seen in drugstores sections like big congratulations versus just a regular congratulation or like work anniversary versus significant work anniversary, like different levels of condolences.

664
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,860
Scott: Well, I mean, I'm talking more like, OK, so there's a company, Papyrus with the overpriced cards or whatever.

665
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:00,197
Scott: Right.

666
00:47:00,662 --> 00:47:02,520
Scott: I think they might have gotten bought by so I don't know.

667
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:06,660
Scott: Anyway, but their cards are like extra fancy with like materials.

668
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,619
Scott: And right.

669
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:14,179
Scott: And then you've got some like the love pop ones which came out, which are like these pop up cards.

670
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:16,720
Scott: And it's like, you know, they're really fancy.

671
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,159
Scott: You open it up and like there's a pop up scene.

672
00:47:20,483 --> 00:47:25,328
Scott: It's like, you know, and then the way those have like an insert that you write on and there's no words.

673
00:47:25,368 --> 00:47:26,500
Scott: you have to write everything yourself.

674
00:47:26,668 --> 00:47:26,879
Scott: Right.

675
00:47:27,182 --> 00:47:28,580
Scott: So those are pretty good.

676
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:42,840
Scott: And then, you know, in Astoria here, we've got like, you know, the local, you know, we've got local shops and they've got like some hyper local cards going on right from companies you never even heard of that are like making greeting cards and selling them a whole bunch.

677
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:47,060
Scott: But only, you know, in in more indie stores.

678
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:47,210
Scott: Right.

679
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:57,760
Scott: It's like the indie greeting card market, because now the, you know, the technology to make design cards with Photoshop and then print them, you know, got democratized.

680
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,798
Scott: You didn't have to have a giant, enormous printing press like Hallmark had in the 80s or whatever.

681
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,280
Scott: And, you know, anyone could do it now, but also an Etsy.

682
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:12,100
Scott: You could make you could design a greeting card, go on Etsy, sell it, and people will buy it and use it for their occasions.

683
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:21,660
Rym: You know, so when I was a kid, as a result of, you know, before all of that, there weren't that many different greeting cards and you'd all get the same one.

684
00:48:22,082 --> 00:48:32,820
Rym: And the other thing I always remember is that there were just sort of like these social rules of sending them where you were like as a kid, like we're obligated to send them even if we didn't care about people, like they were just a thing.

685
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,240
Scott: Every relative said, well, it's not like you could email someone and phone calls were long distance cost money.

686
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,820
Scott: So like, you know, you would send someone, you know, it's like someone's birthday.

687
00:48:42,305 --> 00:48:43,100
Scott: You sent cards.

688
00:48:43,201 --> 00:48:45,059
Scott: If it's your birthday, you got cards.

689
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:48,420
Scott: You know, but what's interesting now, you just text someone when it's their birthday.

690
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,013
Rym: If I wanted to communicate, I would like.

691
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,559
Rym: back then, I was like, sometimes I would write a letter like that was the thing.

692
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,818
Rym: You know, we're very old.

693
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:56,540
Rym: I would write letters to people.

694
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,440
Rym: Sometimes people like relatives read letters to us.

695
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,980
Rym: We do a phone call, which for was a big deal in the era when long distance was the thing.

696
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:04,940
Rym: like couldn't call.

697
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,138
Scott: People who went on vacation would send you a postcard because it's not like they could call you or anything from there.

698
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:17,340
Rym: I remember when my grandparents were in New Zealand, we we did one phone call with them and it was late at night.

699
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:19,740
Rym: And that was like the biggest fucking deal.

700
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:21,580
Rym: Like we're going to do this phone call.

701
00:49:21,682 --> 00:49:22,740
Rym: It's going to be really expensive.

702
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:26,000
Scott: We just sent postcards when someone was in an island or something.

703
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:36,760
Rym: But what I also what I remember as a result of that is that most of the cards I received and most of the cards I sent, we had and there was I would not write a message in them.

704
00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:37,718
Rym: I would just sign them.

705
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:44,440
Rym: They had a canned message and almost every greeting card I ever received just had a canned message, even within the family.

706
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:59,180
Rym: It was mostly just canned messages, except the handful of people both in the family and just friends and people I knew who were like the greeting card people who would always get a blank one and completely fill it with a letter.

707
00:50:00,304 --> 00:50:01,500
Rym: But that was the exception.

708
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:13,700
Rym: Like there was one on who would do this, one grandma who would do this, the mom of the one friend who would do this, the one family who would get a custom card with their own photos in it and send like the same card to everyone over Christmas.

709
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,660
Scott: Oh, you got to talk about the holiday card thing.

710
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:25,740
Rym: Yeah, but I noticed, at least in my family, it really dropped off once the Internet started to take off and we started to email each other.

711
00:50:26,281 --> 00:50:31,260
Rym: And there was a period when I just stopped like middle, late middle school.

712
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:32,840
Rym: I stopped doing cards of any kind.

713
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:34,120
Rym: I would give no one a card.

714
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:35,499
Rym: I would only email people.

715
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:42,316
Rym: And I noticed that I stopped getting cards from anyone who wasn't old around that time as well.

716
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:48,000
Scott: Yeah, everyone just sends a Facebook, you know, post on their Facebook wall on your birthday or whatever, you know, no one send in a car.

717
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:50,336
Rym: They started to come back around later.

718
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:56,720
Rym: But I think that's partly an artifact of my less online contacts and less online relatives.

719
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,439
Rym: Like my mom just watches the stream.

720
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,559
Rym: She's really watching this right now.

721
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,880
Rym: Like some of my distant friends and family follow me online or we interact online.

722
00:51:05,221 --> 00:51:12,600
Rym: But then there's the subset who aren't as online and I interact with them much more via cards than I do everyone else.

723
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:21,840
Rym: Not that I don't talk to them outside of cards, but those are the people who tend to send and receive cards with me more so than people who are online enough to just text me on like my birthday.

724
00:51:23,134 --> 00:51:23,240
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:31,660
Scott: I mean, you know, the card nowadays is really, you know, when I was a kid, it was common probably because, you know, you're getting birthday gifts constantly, you know, holiday gifts constantly.

726
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,619
Scott: So there's cards attached to them in some way.

727
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,166
Scott: Right.

728
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:38,180
Scott: Or, you know, there's relatives, you know, you don't see or talk with often enough.

729
00:51:38,381 --> 00:51:51,379
Scott: You know, there's a special event, but nowadays it's like, OK, I'm only really using the card and getting the card when it's like a special situation like, OK, I'm coming to your wedding and I'm giving you a gift.

730
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:52,159
Scott: Right.

731
00:51:52,582 --> 00:51:54,680
Scott: And I'm putting the gift in this card.

732
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:55,163
Scott: I can't just.

733
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:57,320
Scott: it would be weird if I just handed you a check on its own.

734
00:51:57,403 --> 00:51:57,577
Scott: Right.

735
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,359
Scott: So I got to put it in a card.

736
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:00,138
Scott: Right.

737
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:04,300
Scott: It's almost, you know, or I'm getting you a gift for the holiday.

738
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,183
Scott: I will.

739
00:52:05,424 --> 00:52:10,196
Scott: it would be weird if I just gave you the gift and just a blank just wrapped and that's it.

740
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,920
Scott: I have to take a card and tape it to the outside of the package for years now.

741
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,539
Rym: What we've been doing is Emily would do this a lot.

742
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,320
Rym: Her family does it.

743
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:26,860
Rym: So we started doing it just generally is if we have a gift, we'll wrap it in some sort of towel, like a nice cloth of some kind and reuse that for future gifts.

744
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,660
Scott: We you know, there's the gift bags for people who don't want to wrap anything.

745
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:35,000
Scott: Yeah, we we have the gift bags and then we just save them and use them again.

746
00:52:35,542 --> 00:52:36,979
Rym: Yeah, we just use the fancy cloth.

747
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,140
Scott: You just put tissue paper to hide what's inside so no one goes to the top.

748
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,520
Scott: And then you next year you just look and you go look in the closet and see if you have a bag that's the right size.

749
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:50,999
Scott: And you know, you only have to use the wrapping paper if it's, you know, a more serious biz deal.

750
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:51,900
Rym: Yeah.

751
00:52:52,540 --> 00:53:11,112
Rym: The other thing I remember is some the holiday cards were a special thing because many families, not every family, not every part of every family, like even in my family orbit, some like a subset of them would send a very long like card that was really just a letter or just really honestly, and

752
00:53:11,172 --> 00:53:12,299
Scott: I don't have anyone who did that.

753
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:29,720
Rym: We did, but it was mostly that like really disappeared from my entire life around the time that the Internet really took off in that those letters were mostly just like, here's an update on all the things that happened to us because we don't talk often because you live really, really far away.

754
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,480
Scott: You don't know because there's no such thing as Facebook.

755
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:41,518
Scott: And the thing as a kid, like the cards that we don't talk on the phone regularly, but I still think of you.

756
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:45,980
Rym: I always hated the the cards that they made us do in school.

757
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,020
Rym: Like, all right, it's Valentine's Day.

758
00:53:48,362 --> 00:53:50,058
Rym: You have to make a card for everyone in your class.

759
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:57,279
Rym: Well, I mean, I thought that I like those because I only like getting the candy that would generally come along with it.

760
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,780
Scott: But you would get the box that was full.

761
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,720
Scott: That was designed for school.

762
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:02,296
Rym: Oh, yeah.

763
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,579
Rym: The one that's like, hey, it's Zelda cards.

764
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,520
Scott: Exactly.

765
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,700
Scott: And it would you get a cool one like, you know, Ninja Turtles or something.

766
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,378
Rym: But I was the nerd who gave the cool Nintendo one and the non nerds thought that stuff was lame as hell.

767
00:54:16,203 --> 00:54:17,580
Scott: I mean, there were enough nerdy people.

768
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,280
Scott: I got some good ones and then you got some normal ones to choose, you know, whatever.

769
00:54:21,827 --> 00:54:22,039
Scott: Right.

770
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,860
Scott: But, you know, you got it was like getting a goodie bag.

771
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:24,992
Scott: Right.

772
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,440
Scott: It was fine.

773
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:25,940
Scott: You know, it's fine.

774
00:54:26,185 --> 00:54:26,980
Rym: One class had a rule.

775
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:32,894
Rym: You had to write something in every card, which was rough because I didn't even know half of these kids and the other half of them.

776
00:54:32,954 --> 00:54:33,820
Rym: I avoided on purpose.

777
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,459
Scott: I just wrote Happy Valentine's Day.

778
00:54:37,184 --> 00:54:40,820
Rym: One year in third grade, they were like, it can't just be Happy Valentine's Day.

779
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,979
Rym: You have to write something personal.

780
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:43,719
Scott: Whatever.

781
00:54:44,321 --> 00:54:44,857
Rym: I was right.

782
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,139
Scott: I'll write the word something personal.

783
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:46,649
Scott: Yeah.

784
00:54:49,446 --> 00:54:50,179
Rym: I don't remember what I did.

785
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,459
Rym: I remember being mad about it.

786
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:53,685
Scott: Yeah.

787
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,099
Scott: Pretty much only use and get the cards in the special occasion times.

788
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:00,920
Scott: Especially if I have to put money or a check in something.

789
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,686
Scott: Or if it's like, yeah, you got to give a gift to the door people at the end of the year.

790
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:05,640
Scott: Super.

791
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:06,280
Scott: Right.

792
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,198
Scott: You put that in a card.

793
00:55:07,491 --> 00:55:07,640
Scott: Right.

794
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,935
Scott: You can't just give some Benjamin's like, there you go.

795
00:55:13,424 --> 00:55:13,534
Scott: Right.

796
00:55:14,402 --> 00:55:20,920
Scott: But I think that, you know, the purpose of the cards is not just this sort of physical gift vehicle.

797
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:30,600
Scott: You know, since the letter purpose is, like we said, gone, it's also sort of like this social lubricant for people.

798
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,398
Scott: You don't want you feel awkward or you feel uncomfortable, right?

799
00:55:37,562 --> 00:55:40,960
Scott: Expressing heartfelt, you know, sincere heartfelt sentimentality.

800
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:45,065
Rym: Either because that's difficult or because you don't have anything in particular to say.

801
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,698
Rym: There's a lot of reasons that could be the case.

802
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,740
Scott: Like face to face, right?

803
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:51,160
Scott: Like you're going to go to the doorman, right?

804
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:55,180
Scott: And be like, you know, I really appreciate, you know, you work hard, right?

805
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,839
Scott: You know, you think, you know, I see you here every day.

806
00:55:58,161 --> 00:56:01,899
Scott: You know, my life is a lot better, you know, than it would be if you weren't here.

807
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:02,126
Scott: Right.

808
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,439
Scott: You're doing a great job.

809
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:08,100
Scott: You know, imagine, imagine all my packages would be stolen if you didn't come and do this job, right?

810
00:56:08,485 --> 00:56:09,239
Scott: It means a lot to me.

811
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,680
Scott: It's like, that would be awkward to actually say that to the doorman, even though it's true.

812
00:56:14,943 --> 00:56:16,360
Scott: And that's what you feel, right?

813
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:25,899
Scott: It's like giving a card is like, aha, a non-awkward way to express those feelings to especially someone you're not super close with.

814
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,158
Scott: It's also, if you are close with them, right?

815
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,960
Scott: It's, you know, it's very important.

816
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:38,259
Rym: I don't know how long it'll remain this way for people to ping people who are not online in their lives.

817
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:54,219
Rym: Because in fact, like a lot of people you pay, you either have the mutual social media stuff or you use email or some technology to occasionally ping people that you want to stay in touch with, but don't have anything particular to say to like, hey, I recognize that we still know each other, us too.

818
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,699
Rym: Like, hey, I point out, I note that you still exist.

819
00:56:58,365 --> 00:56:58,568
Rym: Like.

820
00:56:58,609 --> 00:56:59,260
Rym: I've clicked on you.

821
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,480
Rym: I poked you on Facebook or whatever, but not online people.

822
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,960
Rym: The card is like the only way to do that because those people aren't going to SMS you.

823
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,740
Rym: They're not going to text you.

824
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,919
Scott: I don't think there's any such people anymore.

825
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:11,359
Rym: I still encounter people like that.

826
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:20,198
Rym: And also those are the people who you don't often necessarily want to call them because you don't have a lot to say to them.

827
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,620
Rym: Even if you care about call would be awkward.

828
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:28,899
Rym: Like I said, so the generic card with a little bit like a little note is a really good way to stay in touch with those people.

829
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,560
Scott: So let's talk about the thing I mentioned before.

830
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:31,840
Scott: Right.

831
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,659
Scott: The holiday card.

832
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,500
Scott: There is a tradition that I didn't do because we're Jews.

833
00:57:35,709 --> 00:57:35,920
Scott: Right.

834
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,083
Scott: But in the

835
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:37,644
Scott: U.S.,

836
00:57:38,406 --> 00:57:46,280
Scott: especially Christmas, people will make a holiday card usually with like a family photo or a pet photo.

837
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:46,525
Scott: Right.

838
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:57,300
Scott: They'll have them made and they'll send one to literally everyone they know, every family at every other house in their family, every address in their contact list.

839
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:57,465
Scott: Right.

840
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,279
Scott: That's someone who is close enough relation to them.

841
00:58:02,664 --> 00:58:06,800
Rym: Everyone had like the one extended family relation who did that.

842
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,737
Rym: And you get it every year.

843
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,800
Scott: Like who's the friend, family, coworkers.

844
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:14,280
Scott: And they would send the card like to everyone, like holiday greetings from our family.

845
00:58:14,773 --> 00:58:14,940
Scott: Right.

846
00:58:15,021 --> 00:58:16,498
Scott: Here's a photo of us this year.

847
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:16,965
Scott: Right.

848
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,679
Scott: And just, you know, make a huge pile of them, like a little project every year.

849
00:58:21,361 --> 00:58:27,986
Scott: And, you know, on the one hand, it's sort of like, eh, you receive one of those and you're like, eh.

850
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:34,339
Scott: But on the other hand, it's like if I'm on the sending end, it's like, eh, you know.

851
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:34,788
Scott: Yeah.

852
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,620
Scott: It's like, you know, it's all right.

853
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,597
Scott: It's like I could have fun doing that, especially, you know, when you're getting creative with it.

854
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,880
Scott: Especially nowadays with your photo shops and your printing skills.

855
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:54,060
Rym: You know, you can make a lot of the artist friends we have do a Chinese New Year card where they put some of their own original art on a card and like do a little thing.

856
00:58:54,680 --> 00:59:03,279
Scott: That's one thing I do know is that in Japan, the manga artists all make a and all the animators, they'll always make like a New Year image.

857
00:59:04,101 --> 00:59:05,380
Scott: They'll draw a New Year's picture.

858
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:11,363
Scott: And I think they, you know, in the past, they may have put it on cards, but now they'll like like.

859
00:59:11,404 --> 00:59:16,840
Scott: I think even like Miyazaki drew a picture and then he just posts it on the posted on social media or whatever.

860
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,699
Scott: Like, here's my New Year's image that I drew.

861
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:19,097
Rym: Yeah.

862
00:59:19,304 --> 00:59:19,433
Rym: Right.

863
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,268
Scott: Yeah.

864
00:59:20,562 --> 00:59:21,719
Scott: And that's, you know, that's nice.

865
00:59:22,306 --> 00:59:22,739
Scott: I like that.

866
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:34,240
Rym: But yeah, it's this industry definitely got largely altered by the fact that technology exists, but it moved in.

867
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,200
Scott: It's in a really good place right now.

868
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,036
Scott: Yeah.

869
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,980
Rym: Apparently, there still are really only two major producers of them in the globe.

870
00:59:41,821 --> 00:59:44,440
Scott: It's still weird that there's still two major producers even.

871
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:52,858
Rym: But like, I think what's happening is most people do not put as much thought into this topic as we just did doing a podcast about it.

872
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:59,340
Scott: So echoing back to the first part of the show, I feel like for the past decade, though, I was like, I haven't bought a Hallmark or an American.

873
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:06,000
Scott: Oh, no, I've ever if I've ever gotten one, it's either been a local indie, you know, one or the the love pop ones.

874
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,479
Scott: I like a lot the pop of ones.

875
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:08,056
Rym: Yeah.

876
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:11,800
Scott: Although they may have that company may have been bought by one of the bigger companies.

877
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:12,377
Scott: I'm not sure.

878
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:15,940
Scott: But even if they did, I was buying from them when they were still small.

879
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:24,500
Rym: Well, I remember once when I was young, like late middle school, we got Christmas cards from like a family that was friends with our family.

880
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:31,960
Rym: But it had photos of them in it, which at the time was very expensive and not easy for normal people.

881
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,240
Scott: Film photos.

882
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,180
Scott: You're going to go to get them developed and print out a whole bunch of them.

883
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,940
Scott: And you can't just see photos on Facebook, right?

884
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:39,825
Scott: It was like that.

885
01:00:42,782 --> 01:00:44,940
Scott: They were they were having this person in months.

886
01:00:45,001 --> 01:00:47,059
Scott: Oh, I can see what they look like now.

887
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:50,834
Rym: And that was another, you know, another function that disappeared was.

888
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:54,099
Rym: that was the only way I would see what people who didn't live near us.

889
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,600
Scott: I didn't see selfies of them every day on Instagram.

890
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:06,739
Rym: So like I didn't have a digital image of myself that I could do anything with until eighth grade when I scanned a photo of myself in the computer lab at our at in my middle school.

891
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,999
Rym: And then I had that photo on a floppy disk.

892
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:14,680
Rym: It was like a couple hundred pixels, probably.

893
01:01:15,552 --> 01:01:15,615
Scott: Yep.

894
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,980
Rym: And I remember I photoshopped another earring onto my will not photoshopped.

895
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,271
Rym: I think I used MS pain to see what an earring would look like to decide if I should get a second earring like.

896
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:25,039
Rym: that was the extent.

897
01:01:28,463 --> 01:01:29,878
Rym: So, yeah, I think that was a show.

898
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:37,158
Scott: Yeah, I got a. you know, I got a. I basically say every greeting card that I've gotten, I have in a drawer over there.

899
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:39,160
Rym: But I started drawing old ones.

900
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,780
Rym: I keep them for like a year and I purge.

901
01:01:41,002 --> 01:01:41,160
Scott: I don't.

902
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,300
Scott: The thing is, I don't have that many because at a certain point they stopped coming.

903
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:46,619
Scott: So it's like that's all I've ever going to get pretty much.

904
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,120
Rym: I think I have a pile of them back at home.

905
01:01:49,421 --> 01:01:50,998
Rym: Like my mom probably has a pile of old ones.

906
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,239
Scott: My mom definitely has a huge pile of them.

907
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:57,440
Scott: But I've only got the ones that I've received directly since leaving home.

908
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:01,760
Scott: So and I'm not receiving any more.

909
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:07,180
Scott: And I guess if I have a special event, I can't imagine what special event would result in getting a bunch of cards.

910
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:07,598
Scott: I don't know.

911
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:10,060
Scott: Maybe if I get sick and I get get hopefully that doesn't happen.

912
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:10,759
Scott: I could get well soon.

913
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:18,780
Rym: I mean, the truest gift for a friend in the modern era is an old copy of EGM, which there are rituals and how that's delivered.

914
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:28,960
Rym: And this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

915
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:34,099
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

916
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,500
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

917
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,420
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

918
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,180
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

919

920
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

921
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,120
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

922
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:07,080
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Link Iggi, Dread Lillie, Tenderbrain, a bunch of people who don't want me to say who really don't want me to say their names.

923
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:16,880
Rym: Chris Lidad, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, Kishaya85, Rebecca Dunn, Revue, MadBull34, Cowards, Sam Erickson, Shervin, Mount Horrell, Taylor Braun.

924
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:27,474
Rym: The next station is York Mills, York Mills Station and several people who I will not reveal in this current stinger to this episode of GeekNights because they have asked me not to.

925
01:03:28,361 --> 01:03:30,258
Rym: So, uh, yeah, I don't know.

926
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:35,817
Rym: Let me know what color you want me to make my Rym light and I'll change it for the next stream.

927
01:03:35,923 --> 01:03:36,279
Rym: How's that?

928
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,673
Rym: I'll see who's actually listening to this stinger for right now.

929
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,302
Rym: I simply leave you with Earlier.

930
01:03:40,343 --> 01:03:45,838
Media: this evening, one of my colleagues from Crossy Isles said, why are we going down this road?

931
01:03:47,621 --> 01:03:48,900
Media: And there have been similar questions.

932
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,520
Rym: Why is this so important?

933
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,160
Media: Why is this bill so important?

934
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,680
Media: And I'll answer simply this, that dark money corrupts elections.

935
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:05,015
Media: If you and I donate more than $200 to a campaign, we are recorded.

936
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:18,160
Media: But if extraordinarily wealthy individuals donate hundreds of millions of dollars, they can do it with no attribution, corrupting the elections across this country.

937
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:25,580
Media: Gerrymandering corrupts the system of equal representation.

938
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:40,920
Media: From the earliest debates in this chamber, it was recognized that each of us has a stake in the integrity of the elections in other states so that the people of the United States experience equal representation.

939
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:52,560
Media: We do not have equal representation in the House today, and the gerrymandering going on now will increase that corruption.

940
01:04:54,161 --> 01:05:06,120
Media: And third and most importantly, the power to vote is the most significant right guaranteeing each citizen a voice in the direction of our democracy.

941
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,960
Media: It is the soul of what it means to be a democratic republic.

942
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:20,620
Media: And that power to vote is also the most important check in our system of checks and balances.

943
01:05:23,011 --> 01:05:31,370
Media: With rigged elections, leaders leaning towards autocracy can keep themselves in power.

944
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:43,910
Media: But with fair elections undergirded by a free press, the people can vote out those autocratic leaders who ignore laws and undermine our institutions.

945
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:52,970
Media: It's the most important check in maintaining the integrity of our beloved republic.

946
01:05:55,174 --> 01:05:56,229
Media: Let's go back in time.

947
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:08,040
Media: The rules of the Senate were forged in the Confederation Congress experience.

948
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:17,205
Media: Our founders were engaged during the time they were writing our Constitution and participating in the Confederation Congress.

949
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:25,139
Media: that required a vote of 9 out of 13, two-thirds plus a bit, in order to pass any law.

950
01:06:26,421 --> 01:06:31,100
Media: And it prevented them from being able to pay the pensions of our veterans.

951
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,940
Media: And it prevented them from raising money for Shea's Rebellion.

952
01:06:37,321 --> 01:06:44,778
Media: Our founders participating in that process said this supermajority has paralyzed our ability to act.

953
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:53,780
Media: And with that in mind, they wrote our Constitution so that legislation would be passed by simple majority.

954
01:06:54,660 --> 01:07:10,255
Media: That at the end of the debate, when all perspectives were duly considered, the perspective favored by the larger number would be accepted rather than the perspective favored by the smaller number.

955
01:07:11,722 --> 01:07:18,403
Media: And so our founders, leaving nothing to chance, warned us in their writings, "Never adopt a

956
01:07:18,463 --> 01:07:19,573
Media: supermajority.".

957
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:38,140
Media: They said, and I will quote James Madison, that when the general good might require new laws, the principle of free government would be reversed.

958
01:07:39,281 --> 01:07:44,900
Media: It would no longer be the majority that would rule, it would be the power transferred to the minority.

959
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:55,279
Media: And he went on to say the result would be particular emergencies to extort unreasonable indulgences.

960
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,879
Media: Hamilton said many similar things.

961
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:15,380
Media: If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of the majority, the result will be tedious delays and continual negotiation and intrigue and contemptible compromises.

962
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:23,569
Media: He noted the supermajority's real operations to embarrass the administration and destroy the energy of government.

963
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:37,229
Media: And anyone who has seen the energy drained out of this chamber by nothing happening, day after day after day when we have important issues to face, can understand just how right the founders were.

964
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:47,319
Media: So in writing up the guidelines and the vision for the initial Senate, our leaders came up with a Senate code.

965
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,685
Media: And that Senate code was here.

966
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:59,180
Media: all perspectives, in fact, guaranteed in rule four of the original rules that every senator will have the right to speak twice to a question.

967
01:09:01,501 --> 01:09:13,179
Media: In addition, they put into the rules a previous question just in case they couldn't get the debate to wrap up so they could get to that all important vote to determine where the greater number stood.

968
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:19,591
Media: And Thomas Jefferson put into the rule book the manual for the rules.

969
01:09:19,631 --> 01:09:29,520
Media: in 1801, no one is to speak impertinently or beside the question, superfluously or tediously.

970
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:39,470
Media: Hear the debate, consider all perspectives, and take the option the greater number favored.

971
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:49,828
Media: That Senate code endured in a powerful fashion for a very long time.

972
01:09:51,109 --> 01:10:10,669
Media: In 1806, Aaron Burr was rewriting the rules and he said, you know, we've never needed to use the previous question rule in the book because we hear everyone, we hear those perspectives, we take a vote, and we go forward, so we don't need the previous question, and it was dropped from the rule book.

973
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:23,770
Media: And when I hear folks say the Senate never had a simple majority to close debate, they had the Senate code, and they had a rule, and then they said we don't need the rule because we have the Senate code.

974
01:10:25,051 --> 01:10:29,873
Media: And that code continued to endure, which the full understanding of the members of this chamber was.

975
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:33,370
Media: they had no right to prevent the Senate from getting to a final vote.

976
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:50,280
Media: That code was so powerful that in the mid-1800s, when senators started to speak at length in order to make it very difficult to get to a final vote, the press called it piracy.

977
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:56,499
Media: You may wonder, where did that term filibuster come from?

978
01:10:58,982 --> 01:11:03,640
Media: That term is a corruption of the term freebooter, the term for piracy.

979
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,580
Media: The piracy was senators breaking the Senate code.

980
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:10,700
Media: That was the piracy.

981
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:24,380
Media: But still, it happened on rare occasion, and the code was stretched, but not really broken through the 1800s, except on civil rights.

982
01:11:25,602 --> 01:11:28,140
Media: And what happened in our history on civil rights?

983
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:39,360
Media: Well, you had John C. Calhoun leading the nullification movement that said, hey, states don't have to accept any given federal law.

984
01:11:40,221 --> 01:11:42,359
Media: They can choose and pick which ones they want.

985
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:57,959
Media: And initially, that nullification movement was in order to block laws that put tariffs on imported products that strengthened the North and cost more funds to the South, increased the prices of goods.

986
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:10,998
Media: But then it turned to the question of protecting slavery, and nullification continued and even went so far as to say states should have the right to succeed if they don't like those federal laws.

987
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,960
Media: And then we had a civil war over that question, and that was the end of nullification.

988
01:12:18,602 --> 01:12:22,240
Media: But it was not the end of attack on civil rights.

989
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,059
Media: So what did we see after the Civil War?

990
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:31,280
Media: We saw a group of states make it harder for individuals to register to vote.

991
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:38,840
Media: We saw a group of states make it hard for black Americans to get public accommodations.

992
01:12:40,421 --> 01:12:49,256
Media: We saw a group of states make it easier to re-enslave black Americans under the black codes utilizing the slavery clause of the 13th amendment.

993
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:53,180
Media: And Congress responded.

994
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:56,040
Media: The House responded.

995
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:07,300
Media: This Senate responded and said, no, we are here to defend the Constitution, that every person is created equal, and every person's rights must be protected.

996
01:13:07,421 --> 01:13:13,562
Media: That's what this chamber of the Senate did in 1875.

997
01:13:13,562 --> 01:13:22,260
Media: The House passed the Civil Rights Act on public accommodations, guaranteeing access to all public accommodations for all Americans.

998
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:33,700
Media: The House voted 152 to 99, and it came to the Senate, and the Senate voted 38-26, simple majority.

999
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:55,780
Media: Although there were senators here who desperately hated public accommodation bills, because it would end discrimination in the South, they did not filibuster because the Senate code said after all views are heard, you can hold a simple majority vote.

1000
01:13:58,552 --> 01:13:59,249
Media: The Senate code held.

1001
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:03,991
Media: But it didn't hold in 1891.

1002
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:13,921
Media: In 1890, Henry Cabot Lodge, down the hall in the House, introduced what became known as the Lodge Bill, and it said, in order to protect the foundation of

1003
01:14:14,863 --> 01:14:16,426
Scott: our nation, there

1004
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:27,009
Media: can be federal supervision upon request to make sure registration is fair, to make sure the voting process is fair, and to make sure the counting process is fair.

1005
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:52,370
Media: And the bill came here to the Senate, and a bipartisan group filibustered that bill of Southern Democrats and Western senators known as the Silver Senators, and they were anxious to get on to a bill about silver coinage, support the silver mining in the West, and that bill was eventually tabled.

1006
01:14:52,370 --> 01:15:01,850
Media: 1891, the Senate code was broken on civil rights and continued to be broken through.

1007
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:09,770
Media: 1922, the Dyer Anti-Lynching Act, it was filibustered.

1008
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:15,130
Media: 1934, the Cossack and Wagner Anti-Lynching Act, it was filibustered.

1009
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:22,869
Media: 1942, the anti-poll tax bill that put a price on being able to access the ballot box, it was filibustered.

1010
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,023
Media: And on and on.

1011
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:48,210
Media: With the exception of a one-week delay in a bill for arming commercial ships in 1917, virtually every filibuster was to deny black Americans the right to vote, because in lieu of nullification, there had to be a strategy for certain senators to make sure that black Americans didn't get their civil rights.

1012
01:15:48,771 --> 01:15:53,890
Media: That is the sorry chapter of that part of our American history.

1013
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:59,991
Media: Three generations through 1965 paid the price of denied opportunities.

1014
01:16:05,001 --> 01:16:08,895
Media: The Senate code on every other issue essentially survived until 1971 within our lifetimes.

1015
01:16:08,895 --> 01:16:19,657
Media: 1975, '71, we started to see the filibuster go to not just one or two filibusters a year, but to 12, a dozen, imagine that.

1016
01:16:21,881 --> 01:16:42,080
Media: And 1974 to '32, and that was just so outrageous, because each one takes up a week, and so this Senate said that is unacceptable, so we must reform the rules, and it led to the March 1975 rule reform where they went from two-thirds of those voting to 60 members voting.

1017
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,560
Media: Well, the result is that law backfired.

1018
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:57,729
Media: To quickly look at it, cloture on amendments, each one taking up a week, expanded from some six times an entire decade in the 1960s to 143 times in the 2010s.

1019
01:17:01,481 --> 01:17:05,580
Media: From motion to proceed, which is the ability to prevent debate from ever happening.

1020
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:11,280
Media: So the filibuster promote debate was used to kill debate on the motion to proceed.

1021
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,047
Media: It was used ten times in the 1960s, 175 times in the 2010s.

1022
01:17:19,061 --> 01:17:22,228
Media: And on nominations, it went from once in the 1960s to 545 times in the 2010s.

1023
01:17:28,182 --> 01:17:30,314
Media: And how did it happen that it expanded in the 2010s?

1024
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:49,460
Media: Well, it happened because the Republican majority, Republican minority, decided that they were going to obstruct as many of President Obama's nominations as possible.

1025
01:17:51,262 --> 01:17:53,640
Media: And the Democrats did the same thing to President Trump.

1026
01:17:55,701 --> 01:18:02,174
Media: Each one of these takes up a week, an intervening day, 30 hours of debate, another hour of debate for every other senator who wants to speak.

1027
01:18:02,194 --> 01:18:02,839
Media: who didn't get to.

1028
01:18:03,343 --> 01:18:04,040
Media: Every single one.

1029
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:10,220
Media: So when you have over 100 of these a year, it is impossible to have a Senate that works.

1030
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,420
Media: The Senate has been broken.

1031
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:25,590
Media: And perhaps the top champion of breaking the Senate is a minority leader who has engaged in the tactic of delaying obstruction, arguing.

1032
01:18:25,751 --> 01:18:38,640
Media: he wanted to make sure his top priority was making sure President Obama was never reelected and stopping him from having an agenda and stopping him from putting people into office was the strategy.

1033
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:44,560
Media: And Democrats took much the same approach to President Trump.

1034
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,059
Media: So we have both done it, but the Senate is blowing up now.

1035
01:18:50,421 --> 01:19:00,720
Media: You know, that original Congress, the Senate, first term, it said there were about four cabinet members to confirm, plus ambassadors and some judges, four.

1036
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:02,172
Media: We have over 1,000 positions now.

1037
01:19:03,462 --> 01:19:04,640
Media: It's completely out of sync.

1038
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:06,018
Media: The gears don't match.

1039
01:19:07,421 --> 01:19:11,420
Media: And every time there's a filibuster or a nomination, it's another week lost.

1040
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:14,320
Media: So the Senate is now paralyzed.

1041
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:22,638
Media: Because here is the interesting prospect and the unfortunate reality of 60 votes.

1042
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:30,479
Media: The interesting prospect is that a majority of less than 60 has to reach out to the minority to get something done.

1043
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:34,520
Media: And that sounds like it's going to increase cooperation and negotiation.

1044
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:49,139
Media: But the unfortunate reality in our tribal partisan politics is the minority looks at that and says, if we can hold 41 senators from agreeing to close debate, we can paralyze the majority.

1045
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:58,440
Media: That is the overwhelming impact is paralysis and accentuation of partisanship of our current filibuster.

1046
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:07,530
Media: Today's debate, it's not about a filibuster versus no filibuster.

1047
01:20:09,354 --> 01:20:11,190
Media: It's about fixing a broken Senate.

1048
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:23,230
Media: It's about the difference, as my colleague from Virginia has said, from the secret no show filibuster to the public talking filibuster.

1049
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:30,467
Media: Before 1975, people who wanted to extend debate had to actually debate.

1050
01:20:30,848 --> 01:20:32,426
Media: what a notion they had to show up.

1051
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:37,390
Media: And that is painful and difficult to maintain continuous debate.

1052
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,910
Media: And so there's an incentive to negotiate.

1053
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:54,650
Media: But when there's a no show, no effort filibuster where those who say they want to debate are off on vacation because 60 votes is required with or without them, there's no incentive to negotiate.

1054
01:20:55,530 --> 01:21:05,510
Media: So if you believe the Senate should be a place that encourages negotiation, we need a public filibuster, not a secret, silent filibuster.

1055
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:18,650
Media: If you believe that the public should be able to participate in our process, we need not a secret, silent filibuster, but a public filibuster.

1056
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:25,670
Media: We're here, day after day, week after week, we're debating the issue, we're raising amendments, we're considering amendments.

1057
01:21:26,372 --> 01:21:27,370
Media: And what is the result?

1058
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:30,349
Media: The citizens weigh in, they say finally they're considering it.

1059
01:21:30,754 --> 01:21:31,849
Media: Finally, they're debating it.

1060
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:33,450
Media: Finally, they're going to take a debate.

1061
01:21:33,851 --> 01:21:37,210
Media: Now we can weigh in effectively in this moment.

1062
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:55,750
Media: So this is about restoring, reinvigorating debate, restoring the public role, creating an incentive to negotiate, creating an incentive for both sides to work to reach an accommodation.

1063
01:21:57,292 --> 01:22:11,880
Media: Now, my Republican friends have made much today of Democrats signing a letter saying that they are determined to, quote, preserve the ability of members to engage in extended debate -- interesting.

1064
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,080
Media: Preserve the ability of members to engage in extended debate.

1065
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:27,160
Media: The ability to preserve the ability to engage in extended debate means we need the talking public filibuster, not the secret, silent filibuster, which requires no debate at all.

1066
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:43,960
Media: So to my Republican colleagues who signed this letter, this is your opportunity to do what you said -- vote for the principle that the majority leader is going to be laying out forthwith.

1067
01:22:48,960 --> 01:23:26,940
Media: So colleagues, if you believe in the Founders' vision of this Senate, of hearing everyone and hearing everyone well, but eventually getting to a final vote, if you believe in the Senate code, which stood up for so long, not even needing a rule to enforce it, except for civil rights, it held up through 1971, if you want more debate, and you want people who want to debate to have to show up to debate, support the talking filibuster.

1068
01:23:28,965 --> 01:23:34,520
Media: If you believe there should be an incentive for both the majority and the minority to negotiate, support the talking filibuster.

1069
01:23:36,301 --> 01:23:43,440
Media: If you believe the public should have the ability to see us debating issues, then support the talking filibuster.

1070
01:23:45,441 --> 01:23:50,500
Media: And my colleagues have said we must defend the minority leverage.

1071
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:51,960
Media: Amen to that.

1072
01:23:52,120 --> 01:24:03,860
Media: That is why in 2011 I put forward in this chamber the talking filibuster and said we need to defend the minority's right to participate.

1073
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:16,920
Media: Today we have another opportunity to defend the minority's participation, to speak at length for at least twice on any given question on through a complex bill.

1074
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:33,540
Media: But that, colleagues, depends upon ending the era of the secret, silent source of partisanship and paralysis that we currently have and replacing it with the talking public filibuster.

1075
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:46,719
Media: I encourage you all to stand today for the Senate to work and for the Senate, most importantly, to defend the fundamental rights of every American to access the ballot box.
