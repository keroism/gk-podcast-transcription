00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,039
Rym: It's Wednesday, November 1st 2017.

2
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,483
Rym: It's no longer spooky.

3
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:14,205
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:16,088
Scott: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,460
Rym: tonight We're actually reviewing an anime.

6
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:20,403
Rym: That's new.

7
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:22,330
Rym: the ancient magus is bride.

8
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:24,208
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:25,552 --> 00:00:30,510
Rym: So you went to the Rangers game on Halloween, and it was weird that they won, but that's good.

10
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,890
Rym: But because I didn't go to that Rangers game we did I was gonna throw a Halloween party.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:45,050
Rym: But the Rym who thought he wanted to throw a Halloween party is like from six months ago And the Rym right now is just real tired of dealing with like five conventions.

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,123
Rym: I got a plan stuff for and I've been busy and like laundries piling up.

13
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:58,282
Rym: so instead of doing a Halloween party We had a few people over and we just watched Bette Midler in hocus-pocus Which I have not seen since I saw it in the theater as a kid.

14
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:00,190
Scott: I don't even know what that is.

15
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:03,098
Scott: I know who Bette Midler is, but I don't know what.

16
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:13,770
Rym: so you realize Bette Midler played a really over-the-top Witch in a Disney horror movie that sounds about right that get aired in the 90s that I saw in the theaters.

17
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:20,450
Rym: I did not and I remembered more of this movie than I my brain has any right to have remembered.

18
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:21,950
Scott: I mean, it's entirely possible.

19
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:28,158
Scott: It's one of those things where if I see it some dark memory that's buried will just emerge But I never.

20
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:37,170
Rym: the only weird thing is that I remember There being way more songs than it because it was Bette Midler, but there's actually really only one and a half songs in it.

21
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:42,870
Rym: There's Bette Midler's big song I'll put a spell on you and then there's this other song that the other weird witch things.

22
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:45,530
Scott: I think I know a song called off this.

23
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,757
Scott: It sounds familiar.

24
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:48,801
Rym: It's not a new song.

25
00:01:49,383 --> 00:01:51,510
Rym: Okay, but yeah, so we watched it again.

26
00:01:52,791 --> 00:02:03,366
Rym: I'm probably just gonna do a Geek Bite review with Emily of it because we watched it again recently and I think my strategy for Halloween parties forever is going to be watch a weird old Halloween II thing.

27
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:08,568
Scott: I Also learned that it's usually a good strategy, but the you know, I got to watch some scary shit.

28
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,030
Scott: There's not a lot of scary shit these days.

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,293
Rym: well I feel like I could.

30
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:22,882
Scott: someday we'll just watch like one of the old classic slasher film and someone's gonna someone's gonna be like Oh, but Scott here's all these great horror movies that came out and I'm saying yeah There are plenty of horror movies that are and some even great ones.

31
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,490
Scott: I'm saying they're not fucking scary.

32
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,378
Scott: Nothing is scary.

33
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,727
Rym: I would argue get out was scary.

34
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:34,052
Rym: I found get out to be scary What?

35
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,097
Rym: what does it have to be scary?

36
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:35,398
Rym: does that?

37
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:38,010
Rym: does the knife have to actually come out of the screen and try to?

38
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,553
Rym: Hey,

39
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:41,951
Scott: I have to feel terror as it about K imagine

40
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:56,258
Rym: the difference between scary because it makes you feel terror versus scary in the sense that it shows the Situation of other characters who are scared in a tense situation that causes you tension If not necessarily direct fear, right

41
00:02:56,278 --> 00:03:00,570
Scott: like if I'm in real life and say there's lava coming down from a volcano.

42
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,847
Scott: Now I'm afraid and I'm running right if I don't feel that way watching the movie.

43
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:05,610
Scott: It's not scary.

44
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,596
Rym: That's real easy to fix.

45
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,750
Rym: So next time we watch a slasher film like on Halloween I'll say content of the movie has to be making me afraid not some outside.

46
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,897
Rym: no, cuz I was about to say all I have to do is stand behind you with a knife and I May or may not just cut you a little.

47
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:24,380
Scott: I'm saying The content of the movie has to be the thing causing the fear not you with the knife.

48
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,658
Rym: I think that definition is dumb because that is not really feasible or possible?

49
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:36,870
Scott: There have been scary movies in the past like what Name one that's gonna meet your modern definition.

50
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,295
Scott: I was scared of alien when I was a kid.

51
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:39,680
Rym: Yeah, you scared of it now.

52
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:42,278
Rym: No, what would have to change to make you scared of it?

53
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:44,192
Scott: Make it scarier how?

54
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:49,838
Rym: What mechanic will they use other than the jump scare?

55
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:55,560
Scott: or Actually putting you in real physical jump scare doesn't count because that gives me a feeling of surprise and not terror.

56
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,848
Rym: So what is a feeling of terror then?

57
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:01,060
Scott: the same feeling you have when you're standing at the bottom of volcano and lava is coming.

58
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,064
Rym: That's not terror.

59
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:04,916
Rym: That is now that's resignation to death.

60
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:05,518
Scott: No, it's not.

61
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:07,743
Rym: I'm running While I'm running.

62
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:11,413
Rym: I still have a nihilistic resignation toward death as opposed to any particular terror.

63
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:11,494
Rym: Mmm.

64
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,408
Rym: Anyway, I Throw myself down mountains for fun.

65
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:16,594
Rym: I'm not really afraid of stuff.

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:27,580
Rym: I Mean, I'm not afraid of Monsters, I think your definition of what constitutes scary in the context of media is misguided, but I digress hocus-pocus.

67
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:36,244
Rym: The things that are worth noting is that VFX when this movie was made in the early 90s Pretty fucking bad.

68
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:43,104
Rym: Oh, yeah there but they are a step above the VFX From the 80s.

69
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:48,459
Scott: Well, here's the something I noticed a lot is that when a Tron come out the first Tron 80 what?

70
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:52,346
Scott: 2 4 2 4 something.

71
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:54,913
Rym: It was 81, but I don't remember right.

72
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:59,325
Scott: and you look at the old Tron and it's obviously - I was right.

73
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,450
Scott: It's as old as us right.

74
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:04,425
Scott: and you look at the old Tron and I'm not gonna say it's good Obviously, it's not good.

75
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:10,680
Scott: You can see that it was made with really old 1982 computers Right with set with sad graphics.

76
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,798
Scott: I kind of graphics that your home computer made in the early 90s.

77
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,636
Rym: But it's dated in a way to where it looks like something from its time as opposed to.

78
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:19,720
Rym: well weird.

79
00:05:19,882 --> 00:05:22,162
Scott: And even though it is not good Right.

80
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:31,231
Scott: when you look at computer graphics from movies in the 90s pre Toy Story pre Toy Story Right, they're just awful.

81
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:43,400
Scott: Even if you watched them when they were brand new Wasn't until later Toy Story and then also even the matrix which you know All right, stuff like that where the seat the computer graphics in the movie got to a point.

82
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:50,177
Rym: I'm talking more about the VFX like just basic compositing and simple effects like those kinds of things.

83
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:52,322
Rym: They're just in a movie 80s.

84
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:59,473
Rym: all use like these same few techniques and if you watch I don't know Howard the Duck or the He-Man live-action movie.

85
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:03,828
Rym: they both use like this same Because their budget was low right.

86
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,794
Scott: Oh Star Wars didn't have those problems in his front.

87
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:08,080
Rym: the 70 Star Wars used primarily practical effects.

88
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,659
Scott: However, they'd still lightsaber still look good.

89
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,580
Rym: So yes, they did look good, but a lot of practical effects or hand-done effects, but I digress.

90
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,119
Scott: The x-wing still went pee-pee-pew.

91
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:25,579
Rym: The other crazy thing is we're watching the movie and all we could think was everyone involved in this is still alive and still working.

92
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:29,880
Rym: Hocus-pocus to with Bette Midler today would be fucking amazing.

93
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:32,007
Rym: So a lot of the trip.

94
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:32,749
Rym: guess what?

95
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,609
Rym: not only is that actually happening and Disney is doing it Mm-hmm, but Bette Midler was like guys.

96
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,894
Rym: stop trying to make this happen.

97
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,022
Rym: I'm not gonna be involved in this It's shit.

98
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:46,660
Scott: So here's the same story, but the opposite because it's all Halloween II lately, right?

99
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,970
Scott: The there's been talk again of God.

100
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,640
Rym: the article I clicked on randomly is about the remake, right?

101
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,930
Scott: Okay, there has been talk of Beetlejuice because it's Halloween.

102
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,215
Scott: people talking about Beetlejuice.

103
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:58,800
Scott: I got Beetlejuice is cool.

104
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,603
Rym: Yeah, we have to do it.

105
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:00,668
Rym: There's a show on you Beetlejuice.

106
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:03,680
Rym: I have a lot of very specific opinions about Beetlejuice.

107
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:09,620
Scott: Anyway, the thing is there was a Beetlejuice sequel and this huge story behind it and it could still happen.

108
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:16,180
Scott: No, like Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder have been like sort of signed on to it since it began way way way back.

109
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:25,799
Scott: it's called like Beetlejuice in Hawaii or something and It's like still has life somehow even after all those years and it's not a Bette Midler being like.

110
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,302
Scott: no It's like.

111
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,192
Scott: they're like, yes, but it just has.

112
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:29,640
Scott: it just hasn't come about.

113
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:32,820
Rym: So with Beetlejuice that we'll get into anime in a second.

114
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,507
Rym: But I noticed something in the course of talking more about Halloween shit after Halloween It's the day after Halloween where you want.

115
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,578
Rym: It's also the 12th anniversary of gig nights.

116
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:46,226
Rym: last night You're doing this for 12 goddamn years too many years 1,180 episodes.

117
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,109
Scott: I quit and go home.

118
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:47,831
Scott: I'm done.

119
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:48,393
Rym: Finally.

120
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,397
Rym: My time is here myself.

121
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:50,360
Rym: I'll just get the other Scott.

122
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,385
Rym: I got like three Scott's.

123
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:51,727
Rym: Uh-huh.

124
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:52,892
Rym: I'll just bring one of them in.

125
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:53,174
Rym: Uh-huh.

126
00:07:53,555 --> 00:08:00,186
Rym: I I Forced Scott prime to do at least one or two Podcasts in the past and I can.

127
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:01,291
Rym: I can train him.

128
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:01,794
Rym: Mm-hmm.

129
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:14,700
Rym: It'll take a while though, but Beetlejuice the in Beetlejuice the movie contrary to every spin-off and Related merchandise everything that wasn't the actual movie that it was ever made.

130
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:19,369
Rym: They all treat it like Beetlejuice is the hero But in the movie Beetlejuice is the goddamn villain.

131
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:21,357
Scott: Beetlejuice is only also only in like 20% of the movie.

132
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,915
Rym: Yeah, but he is the villain really.

133
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:29,843
Rym: Mm-hmm He like he's just this villain and he's there and the moral of the movie is don't fucking talk to that guy He's the worst.

134
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:33,475
Rym: He'll he will ruin everything and he's dumb also kind of annoying.

135
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:33,977
Scott: Yes.

136
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:34,799
Scott: He's just a bad dude.

137
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,591
Scott: Yeah, but they went to go.

138
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:38,159
Scott: He's basically it's a Faustian tale.

139
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,938
Scott: They went to make a deal with the devil and then he was like.

140
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:45,704
Scott: And then they beat him and they put him back and they did the deal They went to.

141
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,420
Rym: really they went to do with the devil's bureaucracy and that was too hard.

142
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,438
Rym: So then they went and talked to this like low-tier like shit devil and he made the shit that they expect like What did you expect?

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:06,386
Rym: But uh, like if there was a cartoon and that cartoon was just like Beetlejuice and Daria going on adventures together Like all that weird star.

144
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:12,020
Scott: now, I know that that you know, Lydia is Lydia is very goth and similar in character to Daria.

145
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:17,240
Rym: My brain was like nope, no, you're wrong.

146
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:25,108
Rym: So anyway, you know the biggest anime news that we probably haven't talked about is this funimation thing Which I haven't paid a lot of attention to.

147
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:26,734
Scott: so it's one of those situations.

148
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,821
Scott: That's a news but it's not a news yet Right.

149
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:40,372
Scott: So funimation is the number one anime distributor in the United States as far as I'm aware possibly North America I don't know if they do Canada or whatever, but and from a Anime fan like anime consumer perspective.

150
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:41,497
Rym: They're doing a pretty great job.

151
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:42,160
Scott: They're doing alright.

152
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:49,520
Scott: They're doing better than the previous ones that all failed like genie on and you know And a lot of those old companies were sort of I guess absorbed into fun.

153
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:59,520
Scott: I don't know what happened really back then But basically of all the ashes of all those companies that were trying to bring anime to the u.s It's pretty much now just like funimation is the king, right?

154
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,016
Scott: They get the licenses they want and they bring out those shows in the u.s.

155
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:03,860
Scott: And they're on crunchyroll.

156
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,688
Rym: The prince at this point is Netflix.

157
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,453
Rym: We're just like we're just gonna make our own anime.

158
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:09,958
Rym: Yeah, we're making like 30.

159
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,700
Scott: Amazon, Japan.

160
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:15,379
Scott: Yeah, you know you got these other players in there the crunchyrolls the Amazons whatever but it's mostly funimation.

161
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:19,552
Scott: So Funimation Now it's a private company.

162
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:20,195
Scott: It's not public.

163
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:20,978
Scott: You can't buy shares in.

164
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:22,784
Scott: it Has been.

165
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:31,416
Scott: a majority of it is now owned by Sony play PlayStation Sony that is a7s camera Sony TV Bravia Sony.

166
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:47,060
Rym: anything Involving Sony is fraught with ridiculous contradictions for the simple fact that different parts of Sony actually want very different things and Sabotage each other and they often operate Independently, but also not independently Sony.

167
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,641
Scott: The only thing a lot of them have in common is the name Sony and that they're all under the umbrella of big Sony in Japan.

168
00:10:52,722 --> 00:11:03,860
Rym: but like Sony's prosumer video stuff is pretty great But it's hobbled often by Sony's entertainment side that wants ridiculous DRM and nonsense and that kind of.

169
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,195
Scott: yeah Even the PSP was hobbled by like the computer department forcing it to use memory sticks.

170
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:09,460
Scott: It's like, you know stuff like that.

171
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:13,920
Scott: Anyway, so as of now Sony owns a majority of Funimation.

172
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:18,031
Scott: the CEO of Funimation Previously, what's his name?

173
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:19,379
Scott: guy Fukunaga or something?

174
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:24,479
Scott: His name you see a lot if you pay attention to anime news in the u.s.

175
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:25,544
Scott: I've never.

176
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,596
Scott: I don't know what the person is like though, you know old GeekNights.

177
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:29,660
Rym: We would have known they.

178
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:34,638
Scott: Yes, they still own some amount of Funimation, but obviously not enough to.

179
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:36,083
Rym: so according to this They probably might.

180
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,830
Rym: they own at most 5% now.

181
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,416
Scott: Yeah, something a CEO owns right.

182
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:43,347
Rym: a CEO owns shares Was only valued at 150 million.

183
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:46,074
Scott: yeah, but it's not that big that's they're just cuz.

184
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:46,455
Scott: think about it.

185
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:48,120
Scott: their profits are not huge.

186
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,268
Scott: They're paying to license animes.

187
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:51,211
Scott: They're not getting that right.

188
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:59,684
Scott: They're paying a lot of money in license fees and then Streaming it and selling merchants shit like that to try to make back the license fees Profit.

189
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:04,700
Scott: and then they send most of the money the revenue right back to the license plate, you know to Japan.

190
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:06,553
Scott: How much money does Funimation keep?

191
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,600
Scott: how many people even work there?

192
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,627
Scott: It's probably like a small little company in California.

193
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:10,570
Scott: So the listener says again.

194
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,714
Rym: Yeah Fukunaga.

195
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:12,176
Scott: Yeah.

196
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:20,314
Scott: Anyway, so Right as of now the CEO still the CEO that all their licenses are the same.

197
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:22,400
Scott: all their releases are untouched.

198
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:35,827
Scott: right everything they're doing for the near future is unchanged, but If I know what I know anytime ever in the history of ever that a company has been bought by another company Shit changes eventually, right?

199
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:40,140
Scott: They always say oh business is usual and then ain't gonna be business as usual.

200
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:57,020
Scott: So the changes that Sony brings to Funimation are going to have a huge impact on anime Legally released in the United States, but you won't see that impact for a year or plus ish Around a year at least minimum or maybe a little less me a little more.

201
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:08,697
Rym: It's interesting though that this is also happening at a time when the distribution side like how people actually watch anime Is having a pretty increasingly large splintering to where there isn't just one place.

202
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:14,500
Rym: You can watch all your anime Mm-hmm, and on one hand I was very happy when it was crunchyroll or bust because that was just easy.

203
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:15,839
Rym: I could see a lot of anime.

204
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:19,571
Rym: I'm basically not willing to pay for multiple services.

205
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:20,253
Scott: Nope.

206
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,598
Scott: I pay for one at a time.

207
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,860
Rym: That's my rule Yep, so I will weigh in the same area.

208
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,318
Rym: So I pay for Netflix and crunchyroll because I watch a lot of Netflix right now.

209
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:37,007
Scott: right now I'm paying for Hulu and crunchyroll, but as soon as The next your petal season is done and there's a new anime to watch I'll temporarily turn my crunchyroll off.

210
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:39,517
Rym: ever though cuz we're gonna we're gonna review a lot more anime.

211
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:46,500
Rym: on GeekNights I keep picking crunchyroll shows, but if you switch to Netflix I'll just pick a show that I know is on that right and then one South Park is over.

212
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,293
Scott: I'm gonna switch from Hulu to Netflix and watch some witches and some other stuff.

213
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:54,643
Rym: Oh, yeah, you haven't seen witches Scott.

214
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:55,426
Rym: it saved anime.

215
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:56,089
Rym: It's so good.

216
00:13:56,109 --> 00:14:00,067
Scott: I mean we trigger saved anime a long time ago Yeah, but it can't save it anime again.

217
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:01,553
Rym: anyway, it's crashed.

218
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,687
Rym: that that itch I had from Maho skydive.

219
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:05,611
Rym: so back in the day.

220
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:07,840
Rym: My brain was just like what's this drug?

221
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,568
Rym: It's back and then it ended.

222
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:14,392
Scott: it knows like I've seen the little witch academia movies Did we actually do the episode on that second movie?

223
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:15,277
Rym: No, we didn't know.

224
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:15,819
Scott: I've seen it.

225
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,168
Rym: Oh, yeah, I could watch that again.

226
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,355
Scott: We could do episode at any time.

227
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:23,560
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so yeah, just like when Disney bought Marvel, right?

228
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,174
Scott: Yeah, you didn't see changes for a while, but now you fucking do right.

229
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:30,480
Rym: so same deal Yep, so we don't know if it'll be good or bad.

230
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:36,617
Rym: I worry the changes will be negative partly because I don't necessarily trust I don't.

231
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:37,800
Scott: I can't see them being positive.

232
00:14:38,102 --> 00:14:39,811
Rym: Yeah, that Sony will.

233
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,440
Scott: they're gonna be neutral at best.

234
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,200
Rym: Yeah, like I see them doing shady stuff around exclusive streaming deals and weird nonsense as well.

235
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,491
Scott: You watch anime so it makes yourself a PlayStation 4.

236
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:56,220
Rym: Yeah PlayStation exclusive for the first month on the simulcast who knows doesn't matter.

237
00:14:56,261 --> 00:15:05,975
Rym: I'm not even a lie If I try to pay for anime and I do pay like I pay for country roll and stuff and I even paid for the Funimation thing for a while back to watch like Yurikuma and stuff back in the day.

238
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:07,360
Rym: Mmm got back in the day.

239
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,203
Rym: That wasn't that long ago.

240
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:19,418
Rym: No, but in all media the moment I encounter resistance where Figuring out how to click on buttons and pay money to watch something is even remotely challenging.

241
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:23,247
Rym: Yeah I pirate so fast.

242
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,052
Rym: I can't even blink.

243
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:25,460
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's how I do.

244
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,486
Rym: So it's kind of an aside.

245
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:38,421
Rym: but in the other news, that's not really new news about anime But it's a topic That I feel like we could do a deeper show on in the future because it's starting to actually affect a lot of anime fans Now.

246
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:43,380
Rym: so when our friends brought hocus-pocus over to watch it, they brought it on a DVD.

247
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,552
Scott: Yeah I had the same problem recently.

248
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:51,979
Scott: is I needed to show Porco Rosso to Amanda who hadn't seen it when one of the jubilee movies she had not seen better to be a pig than a?

249
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,083
Rym: That's right.

250
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:57,560
Scott: and I was like, whoa, I actually happen to have the DVD of that and a bonus DVD that came with it.

251
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:00,131
Rym: Hey remember I got like eight DVDs.

252
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:00,894
Rym: a beautiful dreamer.

253
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:01,377
Scott: So I went.

254
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:13,111
Scott: I found the DVD I had in my binder of DVDs and I went over to the Htbc the new one that has no optical drive to speak of and I said, oh Yeah, my desktop still had an optical drive.

255
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:14,296
Scott: So I used handbrake.

256
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:14,798
Scott: I ripped it.

257
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:15,420
Scott: I transferred it.

258
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,613
Scott: We watched a nice mp4.

259
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:17,179
Scott: It was all good.

260
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:26,247
Scott: But I thought hmm maybe what I should do since I ain't planning to buy a computer maybe next year sometime when Nvidia 1180s come out, right?

261
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:28,758
Scott: I don't not saying I'll buy an 1180, but I'll buy an 11 something.

262
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:38,900
Scott: Yeah presumably maybe I should buy myself a USB 3 optical drive now and Just have it and then never had to buy another optical drive again.

263
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,738
Scott: As long as I live that is what I did because actually mine doesn't play booray.

264
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,459
Rym: No, why would I ever have booray?

265
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,721
Scott: Well, the thing is I never planned to ever buy a booray in my life and I've managed to not do that up to this Point.

266
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,406
Scott: so I see no reason that that would ever change.

267
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:57,320
Scott: Yep, but there are occasions where you just come across a free booray.

268
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,868
Scott: it's just lying around or someone else has one.

269
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:05,356
Scott: and Or external booray drive that I say I know it's blue ray.

270
00:17:05,396 --> 00:17:06,219
Scott: I'm saying booray cuz.

271
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:11,262
Scott: Same reason I say Titan even though I know it's pronounced Titan My.

272
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:17,500
Scott: they're not really any significantly more expensive or different than any other optical drive that doesn't do booray.

273
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:23,260
Scott: So I was like, oh well Why not get the booray one for that one day that someone's gonna bring a booray to your house.

274
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:24,223
Scott: You can watch it.

275
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:28,500
Rym: thing is I could probably just pirate whatever it is that they ostensibly have on that booray faster.

276
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:34,819
Scott: Then I could get the booray Like, you know some data backed up on a booray because they have a booray writer or something or yeah.

277
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:36,525
Rym: Also put it on the cloud.

278
00:17:36,565 --> 00:17:41,822
Scott: sorry kid it's to pay the ten bucks extra or whoever small amount it is to get the Slightly better.

279
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:43,227
Rym: Oh, you want to I'm gladly.

280
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:47,480
Rym: I will gladly sell you my old zip drive because someone might bring a zip disk over.

281
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:48,303
Scott: What if?

282
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:49,226
Scott: what?

283
00:17:49,346 --> 00:17:56,071
Scott: if it's like apocalypse times and the important data is on the zip disk and then I go in I pull out My zip drive and I'm like the world is saved bitches.

284
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:58,220
Rym: All of his zip drives fail and zips fail.

285
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,432
Scott: Why do you think I got my apple 2gs in the closet?

286
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,900
Scott: gonna save the world with that motherfucking?

287
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:09,060
Rym: But there's no Intel management in there in the old days, the only way to see anime was to pirate it.

288
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,653
Rym: Well, the oldest days I'm skipping the old days.

289
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:13,421
Rym: as far as most of you are concerned Please is.

290
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:17,875
Rym: you either bought the DVD you saw in the theater in Japan or you pirated it.

291
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,300
Scott: Japanese TV in this.

292
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:53,414
Rym: but nowadays Pretty much we all just stream our anime Which is fine because I prefer streaming for almost all use cases and I generally don't buy physical media And I never have the exception to that is I would buy physical media before digital media really existed For things that I did not only watch but I had already seen in their entirety Mm-hmm that I thought were important for some reason and that I expected to not only rewatch Semi off like periodically for the rest of my life.

293
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:54,700
Scott: give to other people to watch.

294
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,416
Rym: Yes to show to other people like I will to this day be like, oh you haven't seen cowboy bebop.

295
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:03,559
Rym: take this Come back to me, you know after this weekend and tell me what you think.

296
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:08,660
Rym: Yeah, and now that physical media is stupid and I don't want all that space being wasted in my apartment.

297
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:16,917
Rym: I don't really have any way to own anime because I'm certainly not buying physical media the way it's structured today And no one's gonna sell you a DRM free mp4.

298
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:24,723
Rym: and the other important thing is even if I wanted to buy physical media not gonna buy physical media until I Watch a show.

299
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:28,280
Rym: and I'm confident that that show is going to be a classic for all time.

300
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:31,194
Rym: And I'm also not worried about the time I make that determination.

301
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:32,440
Rym: It's usually out of print again.

302
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:39,913
Scott: I'm also not worried about preservation because a everything that I thought would be like Oh, you'll never be able to get this is come back eventually.

303
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:44,655
Rym: I went on YouTube and watch the Halloween special last night in college.

304
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:45,820
Scott: I want to watch it in college.

305
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:55,711
Scott: I pre-ordered this macross box set from anime go right for like almost $300 of college money Which is a lot Sitting your poor college student.

306
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:56,556
Scott: I still have it.

307
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:57,160
Scott: It's still great.

308
00:19:57,221 --> 00:19:58,235
Scott: I'm still glad I bought it.

309
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:06,118
Scott: But now you can just watch the real macross not robo attack like on Amazon Prime streaming with subtitles.

310
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:13,140
Rym: Nope, so You know now I don't want physical media and I'm not even afraid of DRM.

311
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,351
Rym: The problem is streaming services stuff falls out of rotation.

312
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:16,934
Rym: Then it's gone.

313
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:18,640
Rym: Can't watch it unless you pirate it.

314
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,731
Scott: Well, you know it comes back eventually.

315
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,260
Rym: and also I'm sorry things don't you know.

316
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:27,340
Scott: The other reason you don't worry about preserving is because eat there's some other nerd out there who's preserving it, right?

317
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,194
Scott: Yep, it will always be accessible if you can find that one nerd.

318
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,400
Scott: that nerd doesn't have to be me.

319
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,761
Scott: I got better things to do with my short life on this earth now.

320
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:46,750
Rym: the other reason I you I would have bought physical media was sometimes I want to do a review thing like with antenna and I want to like use that media to make other media which is a pain in the ass To do through a streaming service.

321
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,499
Rym: So I just have to pirate that nowadays.

322
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,785
Rym: But I want.

323
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:52,994
Rym: there is still the use case where there is a show.

324
00:20:53,395 --> 00:21:02,079
Rym: that I decide is something I'm going to show to other people for a long time to come and I want to have per a file permanent access to it of some kind.

325
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,435
Rym: What I really want is actually just a DRM free file that I can pay money for.

326
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:10,286
Rym: I'll even pay good money for it And just download it and that doesn't exist.

327
00:21:10,306 --> 00:21:10,948
Rym: Mm-hmm.

328
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:14,257
Rym: I've been doing that with Amazon for certain shows.

329
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:18,060
Rym: I've been buying Steven Universe and Adventure Time instead of streaming.

330
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:22,060
Scott: I thought about see the thing is you when you told me you did that I was like first I didn't realize they had that.

331
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,320
Scott: They have like the newest episodes of Adventure Time on there.

332
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,263
Rym: Yeah, like.

333
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,335
Scott: they're up to speed with what like is somebody watching on Cartoon Network?

334
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:32,080
Rym: so episodes on TV It's on Amazon within like a day, right?

335
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,626
Scott: So that is really tempting.

336
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,417
Scott: but how much does the season of Adventure Time cost on there?

337
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:37,220
Rym: ten to twenty bucks?

338
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,227
Scott: Okay, so how many seasons are there?

339
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:40,934
Rym: the number of actual seasons?

340
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:42,300
Rym: times two because they split them usually.

341
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:47,520
Rym: So it costs about as much as an old anime box set to buy a many seasons long.

342
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:55,675
Scott: It cost about the same as a right but it's like compared to the price It would cost to like just subscribe to the thing and keep watching them, but they don't offer it.

343
00:21:55,756 --> 00:21:57,220
Scott: on the prime subscription thing.

344
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,380
Scott: Yeah, it's just like I. you know, it's just so much money that it's like it's not worth it.

345
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
Scott: But I do want to have access to those episodes.

346
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,267
Rym: Yep, but we're through at the convenience.

347
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:08,279
Rym: but anime for example can't rely on that kind of thing.

348
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,519
Scott: Can you just give me those episodes so I don't have to buy them?

349
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:15,040
Rym: Uh, I'd have to pirate them from my service cuz I can only watch them on the Amazon thing.

350
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:17,414
Rym: But it does just work like it's great.

351
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:18,316
Scott: I'm sure it does this work.

352
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:18,536
Scott: Yeah.

353
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:20,220
Rym: Yeah, and I do trust it won't go away.

354
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:21,679
Rym: I trust it as much as I trust steam.

355
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:24,026
Scott: Yeah, there was a recent poll of like.

356
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,255
Scott: which of the big tech companies do you trust the most?

357
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:28,143
Scott: and Amazon was like number one In all categories.

358
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:28,485
Rym: Yeah.

359
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:28,948
Rym: Yeah.

360
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:31,340
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, I don't want to go down.

361
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,340
Scott: Amazon's not evil.

362
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:41,992
Scott: They're just evil in such a way that it punishes other businesses that aren't Amazon and is great for customers Which is why people love Amazon, even though they're just as evil as everyone else.

363
00:22:42,052 --> 00:22:44,200
Scott: The difference is Facebook punishes users.

364
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:46,347
Scott: No, right Twitter punishes users.

365
00:22:46,387 --> 00:22:47,310
Scott: Google punishes users.

366
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,380
Scott: I guess Amazon only punishes other businesses by putting them out of business.

367
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:57,240
Rym: I still think physical media is stupid because physical media is just digital media locked on to a format for no good reason.

368
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,384
Rym: I'd rather just get a file.

369
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:04,067
Scott: even if I had the bure drive and I was willing to buy buries I would just rip them all and throw them out.

370
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:06,860
Scott: Yep, or tell them or bring them to book off or who knows what?

371
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:11,172
Scott: So just like we did back in high school with PlayStation games.

372
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:13,040
Scott: Yeah copy them to another CDR.

373
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:14,763
Scott: Bring them back.

374
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:18,679
Scott: You turn mod shit on a blockbuster rent the game copy it bring it back.

375
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:27,204
Rym: So, uh, yeah There's the these fracturing of all these different streaming services coupled with all the different ways to get media It the the problem

376
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:27,766
Scott: is growing

377
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:44,035
Rym: again rather than shrinking which I think is gonna drive a lot of people like me back to the high seas, sir, and that's all I got to say about that because it's time for things Of the day.

378
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:49,090
Rym: So if you don't follow it, which actually not that many people subscribe to this channel.

379
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:56,508
Rym: And again, I gotta be very clear I am NOT saying that you should watch the original he-man again in any capacity.

380
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:58,810
Rym: No, I Made that mistake.

381
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:10,213
Scott: I learned a thing I watched when I was extremely young and had almost no memories of it other than like vague images of and Toys more than the show because the show You know didn't air for that battle damage Skeletor.

382
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:17,404
Scott: like there's a point in my life where I must have been like five or six and wanted to watch he-man because I had He-man toys and it just was not on TV anymore and I couldn't see it.

383
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:18,268
Scott: and it's not like you could.

384
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,710
Scott: well It was later by VHS tapes of he-man.

385
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:27,270
Scott: You know this like it wasn't the thing you couldn't do that, but way more it wasn't until I'm here in college.

386
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:30,554
Scott: They put out like transformers on DVD and I was like, whoa I can actually see that.

387
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:39,670
Rym: now way more interesting than actually watching episodes of he-man is Learning about all the meta around the production of he-man itself and the character.

388
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,137
Scott: Didn't I do a thing in the day about that?

389
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:42,704
Scott: No, I did thunder the barbarian.

390
00:24:42,724 --> 00:24:54,470
Rym: Yeah, so the Official like for real official he-man YouTube account which has less than a hundred thousand subscribers And these videos have fewer views than a lot of our penny like packs lectures.

391
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:56,418
Rym: So you should probably subscribe to this.

392
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:59,150
Rym: the content there is pretty good and fascinating.

393
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:03,130
Rym: So what I'm linking to here is a pretty long video.

394
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,170
Rym: It's like 10 minutes long and it's just 50.

395
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,260
Rym: Interesting things about evil Lynn.

396
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:12,493
Rym: and if you don't remember who evil Lynn was no I remember this.

397
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:14,219
Scott: the thing is the only positive.

398
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:17,850
Scott: the most positive thing about he-man at least for me is the character design.

399
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,330
Scott: You're all these crazy characters because they're trying to make all these toys that I bought.

400
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:28,438
Scott: If I see a character I go that's a he-man character and unless it's he-man or skeleton or she-ra or something or orko I don't know their name.

401
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:29,809
Scott: I'm like who the hell is that?

402
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:33,490
Scott: You could have showed me that character and I say that's the evil lady from he-man.

403
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:33,911
Scott: I don't know.

404
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,456
Scott: I didn't know she was evil in till just now.

405
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:38,607
Scott: Yeah, and I also couldn't tell you the plot of any episode.

406
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:51,042
Rym: I Vaguely remember the plot of some of these episodes but anyway, this video is just kind of fascinating and If you watch t-man as a child and don't remember much about it, don't go.

407
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:55,085
Scott: don't go ruin your positive memories by Going to see this show.

408
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:55,570
Scott: that's awful.

409
00:25:55,931 --> 00:26:02,150
Rym: But this video will probably trigger a lot of weird flashbacks and you'll realize you remember more than you thought.

410
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:03,657
Scott: Nope, I definitely don't.

411
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:06,190
Rym: you don't remember the space battleship.

412
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,021
Rym: No, don't remember evil in teaming up with the sorceress woman and Skeletor.

413
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:11,362
Scott: No.

414
00:26:11,663 --> 00:26:12,886
Scott: Yeah, I don't.

415
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:13,888
Rym: so what do you got?

416
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:17,820
Scott: So You know these days in the in the hockey times.

417
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,070
Scott: There's not as many fights as there used to be which is a good thing.

418
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:23,666
Scott: Yeah, because fighting is barbaric and bad and we don't want to see that.

419
00:26:23,686 --> 00:26:24,670
Scott: we want to see hockey hockey.

420
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:26,176
Scott: I went to hockey game last night.

421
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:27,200
Scott: There were no fights.

422
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:28,505
Scott: It was still exciting as hell.

423
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:29,610
Scott: We don't need fights in hockey.

424
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:31,950
Scott: I'm glad that there are less of them and there should be none of them.

425
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,870
Rym: No, it's it's perverse, but I am also glad that it did exist at some point because I do enjoy hockey fight.

426
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,890
Scott: Well, I mean if it never existed that would have been fine too true, but you can't lie.

427
00:26:41,172 --> 00:26:45,532
Scott: I enjoy a night watching a nice hockey fight, but so many Happened.

428
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,327
Scott: there are already been so many hockey fights and I can already re-enjoy them.

429
00:26:49,387 --> 00:26:53,161
Scott: Thanks to the magic We don't need any more.

430
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,539
Scott: there's already enough that I can get all the enjoyment from hockey fights that I need for my whole life by watching the ones that have already happened.

431
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:06,626
Scott: and Today, I discovered one that is better maybe than any most I have seen top five maybe.

432
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:20,290
Scott: so this is not in the NHL it's in the ECH L between a hockey team from Tallahassee, which is where versus the Louisiana ice gators.

433
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:26,250
Scott: So these are southern United States hockey teams well below the messier line where hockey does not belong.

434
00:27:29,472 --> 00:27:32,415
Scott: February since it was winter 98 is pretty much like.

435
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:41,514
Scott: this is near the peak of like the last era of this kind of fight and even though this is a minor league hockey game, it was apparently being broadcast and Commentated.

436
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,890
Scott: and whoa, this is some brawl they had here.

437
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:50,330
Rym: Now frankly even as a kid like minor league hockey had way bigger fights than real hockey.

438
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:51,335
Scott: It's still true today.

439
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,424
Scott: every time I go to a minor league hockey game.

440
00:27:53,444 --> 00:27:54,208
Scott: There's always a fight.

441
00:27:54,369 --> 00:28:01,150
Rym: the Majority of the Detroit Falcons games I ever went to as a kid had a bench clearing brawl that's halted the game.

442
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:07,890
Rym: Yeah, like I'm not the the full real majority of the games I ever saw cleared the benches.

443
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:11,469
Rym: The best part about this video is the announcers.

444
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:18,333
Scott: It's really weird right because when you get to hockey that's super unprofessional like if you go to the roller hockey down it where I was Taking photos.

445
00:28:18,454 --> 00:28:20,463
Scott: Yeah, you'll never see a fight there cuz the cops will come.

446
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:22,090
Scott: the cops are actually standing there the whole time.

447
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:27,279
Scott: I don't think they were looking for fights, but you know the point is You'll be guilty of assault.

448
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:31,183
Scott: They were looking for offsides sure And it's super professional hockey.

449
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:32,010
Scott: at the top levels.

450
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:37,630
Scott: You see less fighting because people are making a zillion dollars, and they don't need a broken face or a broken leg, right?

451
00:28:38,472 --> 00:28:41,445
Scott: But in the in-between hockey, it's all happy Gilmore.

452
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:42,390
Rym: Oh, baby.

453
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:47,750
Rym: So in the meta moment the book the book was the fifth season we did the episode.

454
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:57,863
Rym: Nope, I'm gonna wait until I finish the entire trilogy of this broken earth or whatever the rest of the books from the fifth season because I had just finished the second one.

455
00:28:57,883 --> 00:29:14,210
Scott: and This weekend November 4th and 5th gamer X East LGBT focused gaming convention you do not have to be LGBT or any other have to be in New York and like games and show up and probably not a homophobe.

456
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:18,727
Scott: Homophobe is probably the only people who shouldn't be there, and it's a pretty great con.

457
00:29:18,747 --> 00:29:19,630
Rym: It's very well organized.

458
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:32,879
Rym: We're gonna be doing our writing game rules lecture on Saturday at 3 30 p.m.. In panels B. The only notable thing about this lecture because this is a talk we've given before for the most part Is that because of the nature of this con.

459
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,610
Scott: you know relatively metamoment fast is there many moments getting too big okay?

460
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,328
Rym: We're gonna actually take questions.

461
00:29:38,912 --> 00:29:42,064
Rym: Well, we normally don't do that so that that is the only reason to attend.

462
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:44,353
Rym: if you're already listening to the show I'm sad.

463
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:45,558
Scott: on September 17 18 19 PAX Unplugged.

464
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:49,694
Scott: Oh my god We're doing a Carcassonne thing.

465
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:53,827
Rym: on Saturday also at 3 30 p.m.. We're doing the Carcassonne thing.

466
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:54,910
Rym: It's weird.

467
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,674
Rym: Parallel.

468
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:56,337
Scott: okay.

469
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:58,769
Scott: next on the calendar after that.

470
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:08,290
Scott: oh I should also mention that this weekend in addition to gamer X is also Blizzcon is Friday and Saturday and the netrunner world championships are Saturday and Sunday.

471
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:13,788
Scott: So if you're sitting at home and can't go to any conventions you can enjoy lots of gaming goodness on your twitch TV.

472
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:21,705
Scott: Yep next month Nothing because that's December just it's holidays, and then we got magfest.

473
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:29,650
Scott: we got packed south January of next year magfest PAX South one two one two first week of the month second week of January.

474
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:32,000
Scott: It's just all con all the time.

475
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,145
Scott: Oh my god.

476
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,275
Rym: It's gonna be great It's gonna be glorious.

477
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:41,460
Scott: and of course if you can't do any of these things because you're really sad Follow us and all the places on the internet that exist.

478
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:45,919
Scott: we got multiple YouTube channels Instagram You can find all these things.

479
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:47,730
Scott: just if you have any brain.

480
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,636
Scott: You know how to use Google.

481
00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:50,588
Scott: you can find it if you want to.

482
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:55,810
Scott: We are the most public you can be on the internet, and you can follow all of our activities.

483
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,059
Rym: I'm not as public as what's-his-name in a on flux.

484
00:30:58,199 --> 00:31:05,858
Scott: if you're already so sad that you're listening to GeekNights And you're hearing my voice right now Then you might as well just you know be even sadder.

485
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,370
Rym: so a nice segue from the meta into our review of an anime shock.

486
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:11,418
Rym: It's been a while.

487
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:12,910
Rym: the ancient Magus is bride.

488
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:26,393
Rym: Part of the reason why we're doing this show and reviewing it is that as you might have noticed on Scott's YouTube channel We have taken the old anime Boston thing where we would review the upcoming season of anime Before

489
00:31:26,473 --> 00:31:27,155
Scott: it came out

490
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:35,161
Rym: based solely on an image and maybe a paragraph at most Mm-hmm, and we're pretty much always right about these shows.

491
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:44,579
Rym: so to put our money where our mouth is We're gonna try to review a lot of the shows that we already reviewed on that on that video By actually watching them and see.

492
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:50,604
Scott: if we don't remind me what we said about this show Let's talk about the show and then remind me what we said about it.

493
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:56,646
Scott: so the ancient You know I don't taint it to like you know agree with myself my heart's kind.

494
00:31:56,666 --> 00:32:04,733
Rym: Oh, you may wish Yeah, if you've seen my heart's guy tie you can figure out what all those words mean and how they line up it literally.

495
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:09,113
Rym: is the bride of the ancient Magus or mage or magic user?

496
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:21,330
Rym: yes, and it is the story of a Reason has replaced his head with a deer skull or always had a deer skull that we don't know what he looks like.

497
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,034
Rym: We don't really know.

498
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:23,020
Scott: yeah at one point.

499
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,090
Scott: He does cover it up with like a sheet Yep, so I guess he also uses that magic to hide it from muggles when he's out.

500
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,530
Scott: It's a human body with a deer skull for a head.

501
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:45,490
Scott: It's the Skeletor model, but otherwise body skeleton head yes, but otherwise he acts like a nice professor You know very powerful and wise mage who obviously has a lot of secrets and possibly evil ones in his past.

502
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,064
Rym: Meanwhile there's this girl who?

503
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,283
Rym: Has sold herself into slavery for reasons right.

504
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,236
Scott: so basically in the first episode It's really structured.

505
00:32:54,296 --> 00:33:00,323
Scott: quite strangely is that they show you the present and introduce these characters But they don't really introduce something to sort of show them right.

506
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:01,730
Scott: like this is the living situation.

507
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:11,210
Scott: She lives in a house with this wizard guy and this other thing and this servant Person who's cooking clearly a fairy and this dude who turns into a dog or dog who turns into a dude?

508
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:14,290
Scott: Oh, yeah, right who seemed cool, but you don't know anything about him anyway.

509
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:24,190
Scott: And then that episode and I guess also the second episode Basically are just a flashback to show you like her early life.

510
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,752
Scott: It doesn't actually show you how she ended up in this situation It just shows.

511
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:34,370
Scott: you like her origin story of like you know going from orphan to entering the world of magic ness.

512
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:38,315
Rym: so the Show itself.

513
00:33:38,355 --> 00:33:46,887
Scott: you know we watch a bunch of episodes so we can review this the way we typically have seen until this episode Where they go to the dragon land which is I'll be three I think or four maybe at most.

514
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,209
Scott: on one hand I think it's three.

515
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,519
Rym: It's if you describe the plot naively.

516
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:57,689
Rym: it has a few warning signs in the sense of This mage buys a woman out of slavery.

517
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:03,427
Scott: Very young clearly less than 18 year old girl 15. okay to be his wife.

518
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,721
Scott: Yeah, the wife is in the title of the show, but there is.

519
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:08,710
Scott: I've not seen any wife activity in the show.

520
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,618
Rym: What he said.

521
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,810
Rym: I want you to be my wife someday.

522
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:14,380
Rym: He says this to her like ten times, I don't remember that.

523
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,068
Rym: we just watched it.

524
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:18,913
Scott: I don't remember that part.

525
00:34:19,454 --> 00:34:30,585
Rym: Okay, okay anyway anyway, so uh That aside while that is in the show it does not go in the direction that that might imply.

526
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:46,030
Rym: It's more like a slice of life show about Really in human beings interacting with each other in parallel to humans in a world where magic is slowly dying Which is very similar actually to the world of Little Witch Academia.

527
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:51,090
Scott: There's also a conflict going on between apparently some evil magic and some good and some not evil magic.

528
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,078
Rym: But it's not really clear what all that is the show.

529
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:54,342
Scott: It's very mysterious like this.

530
00:34:54,362 --> 00:34:56,130
Scott: something's like a dark blobby thing.

531
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,790
Scott: That's you know obviously evil attacking some nice library, and you know messing with shit, right?

532
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:09,169
Rym: Well, I guess what you learn about the world you learn from the mage the same way that this girl learns it.

533
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:19,230
Rym: yep and a lot of the episodes just seem to Introduce over time all these various fantastic like fairies and dragons and other mages and other beings.

534
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:25,186
Rym: you're not really sure what their deal is and You sort of just see them all interacting and stuff playing out.

535
00:35:25,648 --> 00:35:27,128
Rym: and the thing I think it does very well.

536
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:37,464
Rym: That I'm very pleased with because this is something that eccentric family did even better is There are inhuman characters who clearly have inhuman sensibilities and do not act like humans.

537
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:47,786
Rym: the fairies are appropriately dangerous Mm-hmm in the way that a fairy would be expected to be based on the actual fiction about fairies.

538
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:51,901
Scott: the dragons are dragon e Yep, the super old dragon keeping guy.

539
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:53,648
Scott: He's a super old dragon keeping guy.

540
00:35:53,748 --> 00:35:59,973
Rym: Yeah He reeks a little bit of the kind of character I would play in the D&D game though, yes Yes, he is.

541
00:36:00,495 --> 00:36:01,560
Rym: everyone has pointed that out.

542
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:07,607
Scott: the only real negative thing I want to say about this show is that is kind of slow, right?

543
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:14,387
Rym: Yeah, it has a little bit that slice of life feel like we're gonna go to the land of the dragons And it seems like oh, it's not gonna be a good thing.

544
00:36:14,932 --> 00:36:17,750
Scott: It's not that it's slow, and then nothing happens, right?

545
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,758
Scott: It's like I watched one episode and they were.

546
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,870
Scott: I learned about dragons and a lot happened and the plot concluded.

547
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:24,575
Scott: It's like a thing happened right?

548
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:56,310
Scott: It's just that you'll get these shots and some people can see this as a positive, but I don't Where I see it as a positive actually when it occurs in anime movies where you got a lot shots where it's just like alright look it's a picture of the dragon land and we're panning across a Landscape and listening to noises and some dragons are flying over Right and it's like you're just watching like scenery and setting a mood Right and it and that you stay in that on those sorts of shots for like a good 10 20 seconds something like that.

549
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,342
Scott: Right, you know and in anime movies those shots are great.

550
00:36:59,362 --> 00:37:01,450
Scott: You got to open your movie with those, right?

551
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,047
Scott: I love an Evangelion, you know, like they'll have the elevator scene.

552
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:05,851
Scott: shit Like.

553
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:09,784
Scott: well, no shot the ones that all I always remember from evangelical shot.

554
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:10,547
Rym: You hear the crickets.

555
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,130
Scott: Yes crickets They're cicadas.

556
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:20,429
Scott: They show the outside the school in the summer and you hear cicadas for a good like five seconds And then they cut inside the school or inside the apartment right after that.

557
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:27,150
Scott: right it's like this show is loaded with shots like that where just Things are physically moving slowly.

558
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:37,250
Scott: They're showing you things happening second by second and creating these, you know We're not plot is not advancing and you're sitting there watching but ostensibly atmosphere is being created.

559
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,504
Scott: Right, you're watching for like a good 20 seconds to a minute and nothing.

560
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:43,689
Scott: No one says anything No one does anything and that happens a lot.

561
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:48,250
Scott: So like the first two episodes could have been done in one episode if you cut out some of those scenes.

562
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:55,186
Rym: right and that I guess Atmosphere like that kind of atmospheric setting is very common in anime.

563
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:55,809
Scott: and oh, yeah.

564
00:37:56,592 --> 00:38:01,594
Scott: But I think in this show it like I. it is common in anime I expect it and like it.

565
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:15,323
Rym: but in this show it was to the extent where I felt it, you know dragging a little bit well because in this show unlike say eccentric family, which does very similar things I Compare these two shows a lot because there's a lot of interesting comparisons to make.

566
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:17,690
Scott: eccentric family has the fun characters.

567
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:21,648
Scott: This show does not have any characters that I really liked other than the old dragon guy.

568
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:24,845
Scott: Yeah well I guess we're not the dragon person the actual dragon.

569
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:44,690
Rym: when Eccentric family who wanted or other or other great anime that I never feel bored at any second watching them Even when they have atmospheric setup shots like that the atmosphere Ties into the allegory or the story of the episode very neatly Or there's some sort of very nice interconnected artistry to it in this show.

570
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:56,957
Rym: It almost feels like we need atmosphere here it is, but it doesn't tie into any sort of overarching real story Relation or allegory or like.

571
00:38:56,998 --> 00:38:57,960
Rym: it doesn't intertwine.

572
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:03,685
Scott: those shots in Evangelion with the cicadas are reminding you that it's summer Reminding you that there's nobody left here.

573
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:05,395
Scott: Yeah, right They're like they have a purpose.

574
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,270
Scott: if you see it right the ones in this show don't really have a purpose.

575
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:11,602
Scott: They're just sort of like you're sort of like wait like you're just like alright now.

576
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:13,630
Scott: She's walking towards the library.

577
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,037
Scott: Can we get to the library already?

578
00:39:15,057 --> 00:39:19,700
Rym: No, I think part of that is that the as Interesting as the show is again.

579
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,082
Rym: I like it.

580
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:21,029
Rym: I'm not saying it's a bad show.

581
00:39:21,732 --> 00:39:24,600
Rym: It definitely feels very shallow in that.

582
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:31,279
Rym: the thing the themes that are being explored the stories everything Doesn't feel like there's that much under them.

583
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,884
Scott: No, it's pretty much just like okay.

584
00:39:32,924 --> 00:39:33,446
Scott: What's the best?

585
00:39:33,587 --> 00:39:34,570
Rym: Oh you went to the dragon land?

586
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,295
Rym: Oh, here's the dragon life cycle.

587
00:39:36,315 --> 00:39:37,859
Rym: Yep, and now we're leaving.

588
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,704
Rym: Yep, and that's kind of it.

589
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:48,142
Rym: So you get this very long atmospheric scene with this feeling of pathos and Understanding for this old dragon and the life cycle.

590
00:39:48,223 --> 00:39:52,690
Rym: and but at the same time You just met all these characters and it's a throwaway.

591
00:39:52,730 --> 00:40:02,970
Scott: I also created a Chekhov's gun where he's like, oh you're gonna make a branch for me You're gonna take one of my branches to make a magic wand one day and you know that it's some later episode She's gonna come back and make the wand and use it to solve something.

592
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:10,110
Rym: But because these can these dragons were all introduced in this episode and then I'm leaving them in this episode.

593
00:40:10,713 --> 00:40:13,828
Rym: I didn't really have any real investment in the life cycle.

594
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:20,689
Rym: That was repeatedly Telegraph by those children child dragons and just really shallow and kind of hamfisted.

595
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:25,970
Scott: Yeah Well, I mean it's really the main problem is that I just don't like or care about any of the characters.

596
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:39,107
Scott: I actually cared more about that story where when she was an orphan and the parents broke up because she was like draining on Their family and that mom was all upset like I think something much more tragic happened there that we're gonna.

597
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:39,849
Rym: we haven't learned yet.

598
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:52,770
Scott: No, I'm pretty sure it's just that the mom, you know, the the the problems between those two parents were Exacerbated and revealed by them having to actually, you know deal with this problem that they encountered.

599
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,023
Scott: I never see those parents and kids again in this in this.

600
00:40:57,063 --> 00:40:59,450
Rym: I suspect we'll see more in flashbacks of that.

601
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:00,037
Scott: I don't see.

602
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,070
Scott: I think we'll see them again.

603
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:09,762
Scott: But the point is I care about them more than I care about the the main girl The guy with the skull head like this terrible secret of space.

604
00:41:09,782 --> 00:41:11,910
Scott: Like why does he have a skull head the main girl?

605
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,093
Scott: I don't care that much.

606
00:41:13,435 --> 00:41:15,864
Scott: I'm like every anime has this terrible secret of space like that.

607
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:20,777
Rym: The main girl has no Real personality and are only defining characteristics.

608
00:41:20,977 --> 00:41:28,706
Rym: are she's the super powerful thing that we're gonna have a proper noun for yep, and Her past is tragedy.

609
00:41:28,908 --> 00:41:38,467
Scott: Yep and there are some characters who seemed like they cool and might have a good personality like the Dragon-keeping guy and the guy who turns into a dog or dog who turns into a guy.

610
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:45,670
Scott: I can't tell what the Where dog or dog where I don't know but it's like all they do is show you them for like a few seconds.

611
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,290
Scott: They don't really give them the serious attention to make you like them or give you any info.

612
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:51,550
Scott: I'm sure they'll get their episodes.

613
00:41:51,753 --> 00:41:53,713
Scott: But you know It's like you.

614
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:59,234
Scott: look at some other anime that has a cast of characters and they introduce a lot more characters a lot sooner and actually Introduce them.

615
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:00,624
Rym: Yep, but that's it.

616
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:14,795
Rym: It moves slow It has a lot of slice-of-life elements and the actual world building and character development are both actually Pretty shallow and they don't feel like they're all tying together into a deeper Overarching allegorical narrative.

617
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:18,607
Rym: I feel like it's going to be a very direct non allegorical narrative.

618
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:19,410
Scott: Yeah, it's like usually.

619
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:26,026
Scott: My gut feeling is that when you have a terrible secret of space thing, right?

620
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:27,090
Scott: Why does he have a skull head?

621
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:27,753
Scott: What's the deal?

622
00:42:27,773 --> 00:42:30,448
Scott: and you if it's going to be revealed?

623
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:35,310
Scott: well And you're actually gonna March on this plot that you'll have episodes that March on the plot.

624
00:42:35,974 --> 00:42:42,823
Scott: Right when you get these slice-of-life life episodes It feels to me like it's gonna be one of those not actually ending.

625
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:44,287
Scott: you're never gonna learn anything, right?

626
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:50,390
Scott: Well part of that is just backdrop cuz cowboy bebop has a lot of slice-of-life type episodes.

627
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:56,770
Rym: But a big difference too is that those episodes the plot didn't advance but the characters did.

628
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:03,589
Scott: Well partly because the characters change even if the world the characters You don't need to know what the terrible secret is.

629
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:08,770
Rym: But in this show the characters haven't really don't really change in any deep way at least not quickly.

630
00:43:09,511 --> 00:43:11,017
Rym: Nor does the world change.

631
00:43:11,237 --> 00:43:13,024
Rym: you're just getting a reveal of.

632
00:43:13,305 --> 00:43:14,410
Rym: here's the deal with this world.

633
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,582
Rym: But that aside the animation is great.

634
00:43:17,783 --> 00:43:20,918
Rym: The the show is beautiful Soundtracks good.

635
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:21,947
Rym: the opening themes good.

636
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:24,278
Rym: I like the opening theme.

637
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,618
Rym: it it reminds me of some older anime Mmm, I like the opening and closing animations.

638
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,765
Scott: Nah, I don't like the.

639
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:35,658
Scott: the song is just sort of like a Kind of like the opening song.

640
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:37,063
Scott: it's not something I'm gonna jam to.

641
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:39,821
Rym: well, no, I mean if you want a jam You gotta watch Gundam seed.

642
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:45,284
Rym: Yeah But I guess I'm gonna keep watching it for a while and it's only 12 episodes.

643
00:43:45,324 --> 00:43:46,629
Rym: I think so I can finish it.

644
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:52,635
Scott: You tell me if you find out why he has a skull head and then tell me why he has a skull head and I'm gonna Watch something else.

645
00:43:52,816 --> 00:43:54,224
Rym: I'll keep watching until I get.

646
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,594
Scott: it's not a bad show It's just.

647
00:43:55,654 --> 00:43:58,996
Scott: it's not a show that I'm gonna spend my time When I got all this stuff I can do.

648
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:07,810
Rym: it uses these scenes that are clearly meant to set an atmosphere And then make you feel a very strong emotion about something that's happening.

649
00:44:08,452 --> 00:44:19,409
Rym: But that strong emotion is not deserved by the show for what it has shown you up to that point Mm-hmm, so it acts like this is a very important moment and this is very somber and you should feel this.

650
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:29,772
Rym: but you don't feel it intrinsically because They're telling you to feel it and showing you a thing as opposed to making you feel it through the actual evolution of character And story.

651
00:44:30,094 --> 00:44:30,274
Rym: Mm-hmm.

652
00:44:30,998 --> 00:44:34,189
Rym: That's pretty much the harshest thing I can say about a show that I still kind of like All right.

653
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:36,991
Scott: Yeah I mean compare the way they you know They.

654
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:42,070
Scott: they basically literally tell you what the dragon's deal is and the dragon talks and says what his deal is.

655
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,636
Rym: I've never been a fan of right.

656
00:44:43,736 --> 00:44:44,358
Rym: Here's the thing.

657
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:45,301
Rym: What's the deal?

658
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,726
Rym: deal is explained.

659
00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:47,650
Rym: end of episode.

660
00:44:49,193 --> 00:44:53,443
Scott: That dragon is really similar to for example the robots from La Pita.

661
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,826
Scott: now compare how you feel about robots from La Pita to this dragon guy.

662
00:44:57,911 --> 00:45:04,130
Rym: So don't even talk because I've seen both Nao Chica and La Pita in the theater very recently.

663
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:05,595
Rym: I have some very.

664
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:13,078
Rym: that's a very good point to make about those robots because the robots in La Pita Get very little actual screen time.

665
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:14,161
Scott: Oh, yeah almost none.

666
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:18,821
Rym: Their origins are not explained in any explicit way Explicit enough.

667
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,677
Rym: No, no, no No.

668
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:25,510
Rym: So the beauty of La Pita is that the characters are pretty on know worthy like they're just sort of all there to set the world.

669
00:45:25,978 --> 00:45:33,610
Rym: the entire movie The entire movie is this beautiful case study in environmental storytelling.

670
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:46,387
Rym: You've just the places the characters visit the things that are in the world around them tell this epic story of the rise and fall of civilizations and technology over the endless ages.

671
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:51,803
Rym: and the story of those individual characters is almost just a way to experience that.

672
00:45:52,284 --> 00:46:01,978
Rym: and the robots have a Very a very complex implied story, but no character says these robots were made for X And this is why why happened.

673
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:08,927
Rym: but ancient magus bride is literally Dragons work like this and this is why this dragon is turning into a tree.

674
00:46:08,947 --> 00:46:09,308
Rym: Mm-hmm.

675
00:46:10,151 --> 00:46:11,899
Rym: So yeah, I'll keep watching for a while.

676
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:12,622
Rym: It just happened.

677
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:13,967
Scott: He turned into a tree while you were here.

678
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:14,590
Scott: Aren't you lucky?

679
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:22,068
Rym: Well, I mean isn't that the Galaxy Express of every planet you're getting to is having its existential crisis just at the moment that the train arrived?

680
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:30,358
Scott: Well a lot of times it's the existential crisis is Not something that's on the planet.

681
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:31,521
Scott: It's oftentimes.

682
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:33,146
Scott: It's a small like.

683
00:46:33,186 --> 00:46:34,730
Scott: it's not something that's a planet-wide thing.

684
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:39,875
Scott: It'll be like they encounter a character who's crying in the street and that's you know It's a small crisis.

685
00:46:39,915 --> 00:46:43,910
Scott: that true honor or them coming is the catalyst for the crisis.

686
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:45,946
Scott: That is also true showed up on the planet.

687
00:46:46,026 --> 00:46:47,889
Scott: therefore trouble.

688
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:49,942
Rym: Yeah, it's alright.

689
00:46:50,205 --> 00:46:50,629
Rym: I enjoy it.

690
00:46:50,712 --> 00:46:58,770
Scott: Okay if you you know If you're the kind of person who watches Animes that aren't a plus animes then watch this one because it's probably better than most of the other ones.

691
00:46:58,971 --> 00:47:00,941
Rym: Also, a lot of people are talking about it.

692
00:47:01,102 --> 00:47:03,790
Rym: So watch at least one or two episodes So you'll know what they're talking about.

693
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,857
Scott: It's not something you need to go run out and watch.

694
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:12,705
Rym: the manga has been recommended to me a lot over for a while So that was part of why I was feeling that a manga would give you more plus.

695
00:47:12,725 --> 00:47:13,830
Scott: you could read it a lot faster.

696
00:47:14,271 --> 00:47:18,325
Rym: Yeah, but the animation and the color and everything is really great in the anime.

697
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:18,706
Scott: Yes.

698
00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:19,529
Scott: It looks nice.

699
00:47:19,709 --> 00:47:21,516
Scott: Yes It's nice to look at the mod.

700
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:27,209
Rym: the monster like the dragons and the fairies are just really well animated and cool feast for them eyeballs, especially like the library scenes.

701
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:36,170
Rym: So Here is the audio from our judge anime by its cover segment on this exact show.

702
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:37,060
Rym: So, let's see.

703
00:47:37,101 --> 00:47:39,615
Rym: All right, we were No, yum.

704
00:47:39,716 --> 00:47:42,163
Rym: Oh, this is that wife of the magus bride.

705
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:50,775
Scott: Anyway, this description for this one Chisei has lived a full life full of neglect and abuse Far from the warmth of family.

706
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:52,320
Scott: then all hope is lost.

707
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:57,291
Scott: a fateful encounter with a man with a beast head wielding strange Already.

708
00:47:57,392 --> 00:47:58,715
Rym: it's not just a beast head.

709
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:00,861
Rym: It is a beast skull head.

710
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:02,606
Rym: It is Skeletor face.

711
00:48:02,686 --> 00:48:03,408
Rym: It's Skeletor.

712
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:06,789
Scott: this Reminds, but it's hot Skeletor.

713
00:48:07,313 --> 00:48:08,746
Scott: I mean it a little bit of.

714
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:09,109
Scott: you know.

715
00:48:09,411 --> 00:48:12,041
Scott: Just based on that only a little bit of goo and saga.

716
00:48:12,062 --> 00:48:14,010
Scott: right goo and saga is about the guy with the cheetah head.

717
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:15,699
Scott: Yeah, or there's a leopard head.

718
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:16,021
Scott: I don't know.

719
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:17,590
Scott: He's some sort of dangerous.

720
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:25,433
Scott: You know cat head right and in goo and saga and here you have a dude with a day a mysterious skull head, dude Rescuing some girl.

721
00:48:25,454 --> 00:48:26,498
Rym: I feel like this might be.

722
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:29,670
Rym: it says fantasy, but this might be in monster boy genre.

723
00:48:30,172 --> 00:48:31,176
Scott: Yeah, but it's not a boy.

724
00:48:31,236 --> 00:48:31,979
Scott: It's it's a girl.

725
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:34,890
Rym: right monster mysterious man who I will romance?

726
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:35,816
Rym: I don't know.
