00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,447
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 20th, 2019.

2
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:10,769
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:13,840
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,746
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:20,263
Rym: We review Dororo, the anime from 2019.

6
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:20,951
Rym: Not the one from the 60s.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,778
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,820
Rym: So I had to do a thing that I got to do every now and then, but I will only have to do a relatively small number of times in my entire life.

9
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,360
Rym: I had to renew my passport.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,153
Rym: No, I don't know.

11
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,120
Rym: We're gonna go--.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,220
Scott: Don't you just go to the post office?

13
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:36,944
Rym: No.

14
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:38,520
Rym: Have you ever renewed a passport?

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,320
Scott: Yeah, I went to the post office.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:40,862
Rym: Why?

17
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:44,940
Rym: You're not supposed-- So they've actually changed the process a bunch of times.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,726
Scott: I did it one time.

19
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:47,240
Scott: I went to the post office.

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,819
Rym: So nowadays, the correct way to do it is to just mail it to them with a form and they'll just mail it back like that's the way you do it.

21
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:55,251
Scott: All right.

22
00:00:55,842 --> 00:00:58,700
Scott: And the turnaround time-- And then they punch holes in it so you can't use the old one, right?

23
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,339
Scott: Well, yeah, they mail-- But they always give you back the old one.

24
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:02,720
Rym: Yeah, with a hole punched in it.

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,319
Scott: And with holes punched in it so you can't use it.

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,819
Scott: And it's like, why don't you just shred the old one?

27
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:08,500
Rym: Well, because one, people want it back for nostalgia purposes.

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,630
Rym: Maybe, but--.

29
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,080
Rym: Two, because the old one will often have unexpired visas in it if you're a world traveler.

30
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,680
Rym: And you can use the unexpired visa for many countries.

31
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,180
Scott: So you take two passports with you and you're like, here's my new passport.

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,020
Scott: Here's my old visa and my old passport.

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,341
Rym: Yep.

34
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:30,900
Rym: So supposedly, if I want to fly to, say, Brazil tomorrow, I would bring both passports, the old one and the new one, because the old one has my life.

35
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,420
Scott: I mean, it's like, I don't know about most countries, I've seen passports.

36
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,580
Scott: They're like books with actually like, they're not like just stapled.

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,120
Scott: There's like a nice binding on there.

38
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:40,839
Rym: Yeah, my passport is just like a binding.

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:49,320
Scott: Yeah, there's no reason that they, since it's such a somewhat moderately fancy book, they couldn't take those pages of visas out of-- you're sending them the old one.

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,738
Scott: You got to have the old one to renew it.

41
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,160
Scott: Take the pages out of the old one and sell them into the new one.

42
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,018
Rym: One, there is actually international law and treaties about the conformance of passports that make that difficult.

43
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,359
Scott: That must be why they're also similar.

44
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:06,140
Rym: Two, so fun fact, normal passports have a certain number of pages.

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,320
Rym: And as you might know, I filled mine like three times.

46
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:14,040
Rym: So I kept having to get pages added to my passport.

47
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:16,900
Rym: Adding them is a giant pain in the ass.

48
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:18,760
Rym: And it basically comes-- They're on special paper.

49
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:29,100
Rym: Well, it comes back to you with these two sets of pages like sewn into the passport and all these special notes in the passport that are like, yeah, fucking pages were added.

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,899
Rym: This is legit.

51
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:32,578
Rym: These pages are real, dude.

52
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:33,758
Rym: And it was a pain.

53
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,820
Rym: So luckily when I renewed, I'd been told by my guy that you can't get the thick passport anymore.

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,419
Rym: That was a lie.

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,440
Rym: I got the thick passport.

56
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,360
Scott: I haven't had to get any stamps because most of the countries I go to are just put your passport in the machine and then walk through.

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,220
Rym: Yeah, you know, it's funny.

58
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,739
Rym: Actually, most of the places I go are like that, too.

59
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:54,460
Rym: But I went to Turkey like ten goddamn times.

60
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,580
Scott: Oh, so you needed ten pages for ten turkeys.

61
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:02,520
Rym: And it wasn't because technically you're only supposed to get stamps for one country per page, though a lot of places just ignore that.

62
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:03,259
Rym: I didn't know that.

63
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,359
Scott: I thought I thought they were supposed to go in order, but they always just like go in a random place.

64
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,580
Scott: They just open up to a random page stamp.

65
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,139
Scott: Don't even try to get it in the squares.

66
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:13,340
Scott: There's like four squares on a page.

67
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:14,539
Scott: They don't stay in the squares.

68
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,820
Scott: They're just like, man, whatever.

69
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,620
Rym: So some like Germany was like hyper strict about it.

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,999
Rym: So Germany, I have a page.

71
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,559
Scott: The German would put the stamp right side up with the perfect amount of ink in the perfectly centered within the box.

72
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,305
Rym: I have a bunch of pages in a row that are all just Germany in Germany out Germany in Germany out.

73
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:32,040
Rym: That's far on the page.

74
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,579
Rym: Next page, Germany in Germany out.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,242
Rym: But then, like in the middle of one of those is a fucking Canadian stand just like right in the middle.

76
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:43,300
Rym: Why would you get a Canadian stamp if you go to Canada?

77
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,305
Rym: They don't care.

78
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:47,483
Scott: I thought you could just like show your passport and you're like, oh, OK, goodbye.

79
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:51,860
Rym: Well, I flew to Canada and I've flown to Canada several times.

80
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,200
Rym: And they're just like Canada cares.

81
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:57,060
Rym: They give the least fucks of anyone in terms of where they stamp.

82
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:58,380
Rym: As far as I don't see any reason.

83
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,722
Scott: I guess even if I was going to go to Vancouver, I feel like I would fly to Seattle and then go to Vancouver.

84
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:14,940
Rym: So I have one page in my passport that has Japan, Costa Rica, Turkey, Canada, London and Australia, like all just stamped all over the place.

85
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,339
Rym: It's kind of Australia didn't stamp.

86
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,687
Rym: Yeah, they.

87
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:19,420
Rym: I've been to Australia a bunch more times than you.

88
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:20,678
Rym: Sometimes they stamp me.

89
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,891
Rym: Sometimes they don't.

90
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:22,840
Scott: I bought that.

91
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,080
Rym: I got the what our visa, but Turkey was tough because Turkey had to get the stamps, but I also had to keep getting visas because they only lasted like six months.

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,653
Rym: I had to keep buying visas and you buy the.

93
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:33,920
Rym: it was kind of a scam.

94
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:45,319
Rym: Like for Brazil, like you go to the consulate and be like, I want a Brazilian visa and you do a bunch of crap and they give you what looks like an entire passport inside of your passport just for Brazil.

95
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:47,299
Rym: And it lasts like 10 years.

96
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:50,796
Rym: But Turkey, you go in and they will take 20 euros.

97
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:53,780
Rym: They'll take 20 American dollars.

98
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:55,479
Rym: They'll take 20 pounds.

99
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,020
Scott: They don't really care when you should give 20 of the shittiest currency, obviously.

100
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:01,275
Scott: Why would you give 20 pounds?

101
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,102
Scott: You great.

102
00:05:02,122 --> 00:05:04,380
Scott: Well, so pounds might become the shittiest currency.

103
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:05,406
Scott: Well, yeah.

104
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,280
Rym: So I mean, I don't know.

105
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:16,868
Rym: All I know is I go your pounds and they'd be like 20 and I'm like, OK, and I give them 20 bucks and with cash and they would literally just put a Turkish visa there, like no questions asked.

106
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:17,699
Rym: They didn't even look at me.

107
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,691
Rym: It was it was basically just a tax.

108
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:21,280
Rym: every time I came into the country.

109
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:27,545
Rym: The one the few times I came back and I already had a visa, they were shocked that I already had a visa.

110
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,440
Rym: And I had to, like, keep explaining, no, I already have a visa.

111
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,000
Rym: It's still good stamp.

112
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:32,599
Rym: I don't need to give you 20 more dollars.

113
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,900
Rym: But so I got my passport back.

114
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,980
Rym: And if you're worried about the turnaround time, like if I mail it and it comes back, what if I have to travel or something?

115
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,520
Scott: You should be doing the shit way in advance.

116
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,080
Scott: Too many people do it at the last second.

117
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,960
Scott: It's like how often is international travel truly a surprise emergency?

118
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:56,315
Rym: Well, the situation that often comes up is you literally travel internationally, like every single month.

119
00:05:57,842 --> 00:06:01,440
Scott: So you need so what you have to like, take a break in order to renew.

120
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:02,282
Rym: Yeah.

121
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:07,819
Rym: Or if you pay the little bit of extra money for an expedited process, they said like, oh, it'll reduce the time by a little bit.

122
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:09,007
Scott: I heard it's bullshit.

123
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,080
Rym: So I actually did it.

124
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,940
Rym: I paid the extra because I had to take four days.

125
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:19,880
Rym: Oh, I mailed it express because I didn't cost anything.

126
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:22,100
Rym: It got there the next week.

127
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,740
Rym: The passport just came back like done.

128
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,580
Scott: I mean, when I renewed, it didn't take long at all.

129
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,520
Scott: And I did the normal way.

130
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:26,701
Scott: Yeah.

131
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:33,680
Rym: But if you need it in a hurry and you pay for the express, it had it's like instant like it turned out much as it cost extra like 30 or 40 bucks.

132
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:34,474
Scott: Oh, that's not bad.

133
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:34,597
Scott: Yeah.

134
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:38,040
Scott: But I guess only do it if you're in a hurry because still 30, 40 bucks you could buy.

135
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:38,484
Scott: Yeah.

136
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,333
Scott: But nice dinner, 30, 40 bucks.

137
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:41,177
Rym: That's that's what I did.

138
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:41,986
Rym: Yeah.

139
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:42,798
Rym: Depending on where you're eating.

140
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,061
Scott: Yeah.

141
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:44,680
Rym: Well, it depends really outside of New York.

142
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,340
Rym: That's like 10 nice dinners like upstate in Pennsylvania.

143
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,540
Rym: That's like that's like a month's rent and a month's worth of food.

144
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:58,743
Rym: But so here's the crazy thing where I'm getting to my opening bit and then we'll do the real show.

145
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:00,480
Rym: So the craziest thing happens.

146
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:07,862
Rym: I then had to go to this like federal government portal to update my trusted traveler stuff.

147
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:11,259
Rym: So I keep getting like my skip customs thing to work.

148
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:14,620
Rym: And because my company paid for it like before.

149
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:15,425
Rym: So I just have it.

150
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:20,120
Rym: But every time you're near your passport, you got to go into this thing and tell them your new passport number.

151
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,819
Rym: And I assume if I lie, they'll find out.

152
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:24,939
Rym: So I put the real passport number in there.

153
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:31,440
Rym: I didn't want to like come back from a foreign country, try to use try to skip customs and get stopped and have not followed the rules.

154
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:37,866
Rym: So I did this and I go to this old, you know, it's a federal government site in the United States.

155
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,037
Rym: It's a piece of shit.

156
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:39,722
Rym: Yeah.

157
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,280
Rym: Like it like you have to make a password.

158
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,755
Scott: That's like I went to the Secret Service, not Secret Service.

159
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:48,380
Scott: I was social security.

160
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,660
Rym: I was about to ask you a question to the Social Security website recently.

161
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,440
Scott: Just, you know, check it out because you log in there once in a while.

162
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,087
Rym: Not great.

163
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:56,674
Rym: Yeah.

164
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:59,789
Scott: I mean, it worked, but it's not.

165
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,980
Scott: it's better than a 90s website, but it is not good.

166
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,120
Scott: So I've had similar experiences with the Treasury website.

167
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,329
Rym: So I have no chance.

168
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,217
Scott: A lot of security on it.

169
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:15,160
Rym: Oh, I had to use the Treasury website in two thousand and I was bonding it up.

170
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:16,064
Rym: Yeah, I was.

171
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:19,823
Scott: So I had the only reason a normal person would go there to get bond action.

172
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:21,800
Rym: So I went there when I had to do something weird.

173
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,099
Scott: Maybe I'll go buy some bonds.

174
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,220
Rym: I had a bunch of class like the good bonds, the double I think the good bond.

175
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,160
Scott: I had the kinds of people gave me as gifts and I wanted to turn them into money.

176
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,880
Rym: Basically, people our age had a certain kind of bond.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,706
Rym: I think it was the double.

178
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,299
Scott: But I don't buy those for kids.

179
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:36,629
Rym: I assume so.

180
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:37,779
Rym: But they pretty much suck now.

181
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,712
Scott: I mean, yeah.

182
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:40,780
Scott: Who wants to invest in the U.S.

183
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,224
Scott: government?

184
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,080
Rym: No, it's not double.

185
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:44,619
Rym: It's something before that.

186
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:45,189
Rym: Whatever.

187
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:45,780
Scott: It doesn't matter.

188
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,099
Scott: The point is, Treasury website me.

189
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,882
Rym: Anyway, I had like all these bonds and I cashed them all before I went to RIT to buy a computer.

190
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:56,439
Rym: All the bonds I got my entire life basically bought me one computer.

191
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:57,182
Scott: Yep.

192
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:02,440
Rym: Because I spent like four grand on this thing in the year 2000.

193
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,760
Rym: But two of my bonds I could not cash in because I'm not old enough.

194
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:07,263
Rym: No.

195
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:09,440
Rym: When they were all mature, they were actually worth it.

196
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,140
Rym: Like they were worth a lot of money.

197
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:11,635
Scott: Too old?

198
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:18,082
Rym: Uh, when they were purchased in the 80s, the bank just didn't fucking stamp them the right way.

199
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:20,918
Rym: Like they were they were stamped wrong.

200
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:25,340
Rym: So I had to go to the Treasury website and do a ridiculous amount of nonsense.

201
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:32,340
Rym: It would have been easier to tear them up, throw them away and claim they were lost than to get the bonds I actually had corrected.

202
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:35,160
Scott: All I had to do is go to the website, type in some numbers.

203
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:35,826
Scott: Yeah.

204
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:37,400
Scott: And I didn't need the piece of paper anymore.

205
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,860
Scott: Those bonds were now digital.

206
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:39,386
Scott: Yeah.

207
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,240
Scott: And then I could do whatever.

208
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:43,960
Rym: So I went to this government portal that I remember being a nightmare.

209
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:48,660
Rym: And when I go to it, it says, oh, we got rid of that portal.

210
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:53,160
Rym: You got to go over here to this other way more complicated portal now.

211
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:58,860
Rym: So I go there and it just worked automatically.

212
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:00,033
Rym: My account was just there.

213
00:10:00,094 --> 00:10:00,620
Rym: Everything worked.

214
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:03,516
Rym: And as soon as I made my new account, it was like, Mr.

215
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,819
Rym: Decoster, welcome to the portal.

216
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:09,620
Rym: Before you continue, you should set up two factor authentication.

217
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,263
Scott: Yeah, they have to.

218
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:17,800
Scott: Even though the sites are so black, even the crappy Social Security one has, you know, two factor auth of some kind.

219
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,380
Scott: But it wasn't even like the Google kind with some other kind.

220
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,559
Rym: It wasn't the other kind.

221
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,400
Rym: I had the other kind if you sucked.

222
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:25,778
Rym: But it was like, yo, T.O.T.P.

223
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:27,359
Rym: I scanned the barcode just work.

224
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,291
Rym: Google auth auth.

225
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:28,698
Rym: Good to go.

226
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,362
Rym: All right.

227
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:33,700
Rym: I was shocked that I really need the Google auth app to.

228
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,979
Scott: There's really two features that I need in the Google auth app that it doesn't have.

229
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,478
Rym: Back it up so I could like.

230
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,042
Rym: Right.

231
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:41,960
Scott: Feature one, I buy a new phone.

232
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,599
Scott: Let me move everything to my new phone.

233
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:43,962
Scott: Yeah.

234
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:47,500
Scott: And feature two, I got way too many sites in there now.

235
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:48,806
Rym: Let me say favorites.

236
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:51,420
Scott: Let me like set favorites and search and organize them.

237
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,899
Rym: Yeah, because I got like 12 in there.

238
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,173
Scott: I got way more than that.

239
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:54,679
Scott: Let me count.

240
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,500
Rym: Well, because I work doesn't use it.

241
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,039
Rym: I'm my own authenticator for work now.

242
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:01,440
Rym: So the only things I use it for are my own AWS account.

243
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:08,263
Rym: My Google stuff, three, four, like Amazon regular, like regular Amazon that you buy stuff on.

244
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:10,919
Rym: Are some of those work?

245
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,639
Rym: The nice forum, I guess I use it for twenty six.

246
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:15,734
Scott: And yes, some of them are work.

247
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:16,140
Rym: Yeah.

248
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:23,460
Rym: I used to have like eight just for work, but now I work at a place where we roll our own and I have like this fancy hardware three factor thing.

249
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,185
Rym: I don't need my phone.

250
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:25,777
Scott: I work.

251
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,220
Scott: All the things we use are like cloud services, like, you know, Google and Jira.

252
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:31,884
Scott: And so I have.

253
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:34,020
Scott: Yeah, I have a lot of doubles.

254
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,380
Scott: It's like I got like Amazon Web Services, personal Amazon.

255
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:38,364
Scott: Services work.

256
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:42,080
Rym: In fact, it was personal work at my old job.

257
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,639
Rym: I had personal Amazon services, Slack, personal Slack work.

258
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,520
Rym: I had work production, Amazon Web Services.

259
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,460
Rym: Then I had work non-production, Amazon Web Services, three accounts.

260
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:56,620
Rym: OK, but now I work for a company that's so big, like we roll our own everything.

261
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:57,607
Rym: So anyway.

262
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,640
Rym: So, yeah, that was interesting.

263
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,580
Rym: Anyway, it's anime day, right?

264
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,919
Scott: So in the anime news, there was an anime movie in theaters that you usually say, hey, this anime movie in theaters, go see it.

265
00:12:08,623 --> 00:12:10,460
Rym: So wait a minute, wait a minute, though, I'm going to qualify that.

266
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,880
Rym: We usually say I'm going to paraphrase our own advice.

267
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:27,980
Rym: If it's an anime movie that is not a sequel to an existing anime movie, like Pokemon Movie 10 or One Piece Movie seven or whatever it is, then and it's not a compilation hundred and is not a compilation movie.

268
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:29,536
Rym: Always go see it in the theater.

269
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:29,840
Scott: Right.

270
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,073
Scott: So Mobile Suit Gundam NT narrative.

271
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,171
Scott: narrative is like short for NT is short for narrative, not for Windows.

272
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:39,060
Scott: NT was in the theaters.

273
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,167
Rym: I'm actually less interested in this.

274
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:48,100
Scott: already based on this movie supposedly covers the events of like one of the Gundam Unicorn novels.

275
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:51,680
Scott: And it happens like after the regular Gundam Unicorn series.

276
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:54,520
Scott: But before the Gundam series.

277
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,119
Scott: Anyway, I don't understand where exactly it takes place.

278
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,221
Rym: It takes place in UC 0096.

279
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:06,100
Scott: OK, so way after Gundam Unicorn.

280
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:06,761
Scott: Yeah.

281
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:10,380
Scott: Anyway, Gundam Unicorn is OK, I guess whatever.

282
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:12,639
Scott: But yeah, I have not seen this.

283
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:17,620
Scott: I'm not going to see it, but I've seen a lot of people on Twitter comment on it.

284
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:21,200
Scott: And normally I wouldn't take such comments as truth.

285
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:21,883
Scott: Right.

286
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:26,583
Scott: Usually if people say something's good or bad, I just believe them because everybody's wrong.

287
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:30,900
Scott: But the opinion is so unanimous and so believable.

288
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:41,681
Scott: Based on one of my personal experiences, plausibility with other Gundam things that I must relay it to you as if it were true, because I would bet money that it is true.

289
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:48,060
Scott: and what people are saying is that Gundam NT is a Gundam movie and glowing review.

290
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:59,319
Rym: And it is incomprehensible, even to people steeped in Gundam lore and tradition, because Gundam F91 makes no goddamn sense unless you know about Gundam.

291
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:05,344
Scott: The best tweet I saw said Gundam NT was I should.

292
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:06,328
Scott: they said.

293
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:10,925
Scott: they said, why would I watch Gundam NT when I can watch Gundam F91?

294
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:15,351
Scott: And I said, whoa, whoa, is this person about to say something positive about Gundam F91?

295
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,622
Rym: Because you may recall we reviewed Gundam F91 a long time ago when it came out on DVD.

296
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:24,298
Scott: But anyway, they said, why would I watch Gundam NT when I can watch Gundam F91?

297
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:29,439
Scott: It's just as incomprehensible, but at least it looks really good.

298
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:37,960
Scott: So I, Gundam NT, even if I got Gundam, nice try, Gundam nice try.

299
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:46,559
Scott: But yeah, if you know a lot about Gundam, you might be able to understand something that's happening in this, but it might not still, it still might not be worth it.

300
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,021
Rym: Yeah.

301
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:49,841
Scott: And if you don't know anything about Gundam, this movie will mean nothing to you.

302
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:52,080
Scott: Just go watch a regular Gundam.

303
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:53,263
Scott: Yeah.

304
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:56,920
Scott: Like the original one, or maybe Gundam Seed or Gundam Wing or something.

305
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,920
Rym: I feel like the last Gundam.

306
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,188
Scott: This might even, I don't know.

307
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:01,980
Scott: I haven't seen it, so I can't say for sure.

308
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,640
Scott: But I mean, it could be worse than G Gundam.

309
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,240
Scott: At least G Gundam is crazy.

310
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,739
Rym: At least the G Gundam is good at being what it is.

311
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,323
Scott: Right.

312
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:10,739
Scott: You know, anyway, so yeah.

313
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,940
Scott: Avoid Gundam NT in the movie theater.

314
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:19,420
Scott: If you must see it, I guess wait till you can watch it for free somewhere.

315
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:23,476
Rym: I'm curious now, because I feel like there's two classes of Gundams.

316
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:28,861
Rym: in terms of what was the last, there's a lot of classes of Gundams, in terms of what was the last good one.

317
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:34,383
Scott: I mean, you know, the class one is there was a Gundam, the origin thing recently ish.

318
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:36,980
Scott: There was a some blooded orphan thing.

319
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,020
Scott: I don't know what that was about.

320
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,040
Rym: I guess I break them up.

321
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,920
Scott: Gundam Build Diver, which is for a certain group of people.

322
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,880
Rym: What was the last Gundam that was good?

323
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,900
Rym: If you care a lot about Gundam and what is the last Gundam that was good?

324
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:52,580
Rym: If you are aware of Gundam, but don't care that much about it, I mean, I feel like for the latter, Gundam seed might still be the last.

325
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,100
Scott: That's just the last one you saw and know about and care about.

326
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:57,251
Rym: I saw a bunch of unicorn and I just didn't.

327
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:58,076
Rym: I couldn't.

328
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:58,840
Rym: I didn't care.

329
00:15:59,222 --> 00:16:00,537
Rym: It just was all right.

330
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,665
Scott: It was good.

331
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:03,859
Rym: It just I didn't care about.

332
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,970
Scott: I don't watch it.

333
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:05,496
Scott: Good ish.

334
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:06,722
Scott: Good ish.

335
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:15,791
Rym: I think that my problem with gonna unicorn is it had too much talking about Gundam.

336
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:17,260
Scott: Isn't that every Gundam?

337
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:24,138
Rym: Yeah, but like say Gundam seed had a lot of talking about Gundam, but it also had a lot of fire of the low and greens.

338
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,680
Scott: Isn't that every Gundam?

339
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:27,860
Rym: But no, that's not every Gundam.

340
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,621
Rym: Gundam, the OAVs like War in the Pocket is look at this child experiencing the horrors of war.

341
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:38,763
Rym: Yeah, they don't talk a lot about Gundams and those are not like full Gundam series or movies.

342
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:39,937
Scott: Yeah, they're like OAVs.

343
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,940
Rym: But I don't know.

344
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,663
Rym: I just I don't feel like there's been a Gundam that people have talked about super positively since unicorn.

345
00:16:46,684 --> 00:16:54,682
Rym: And I feel like a lot of people kind of fell off the Gundam train if they were even getting on that train after seed, maybe because destiny put a bad taste in the medicine.

346
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:58,723
Scott: If you know, if you if you know a lot about Gundam, you don't need Gundam advice from us.

347
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:04,520
Scott: If you don't know anything about Gundam, just watch Gundam seed and or the original fucking Gundam.

348
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:04,861
Scott: Yep.

349
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:08,900
Rym: And then all the other a set of the OAV slash mini series movies.

350
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,095
Rym: If you're that into it, I think we're in the pocket is we're?

351
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:13,099
Rym: we're in the pocket.

352
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,542
Rym: A.M.S.

353
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:15,098
Rym: team like that stuff's all worth watching.

354
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:16,675
Scott: Those are only two things.

355
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,977
Scott: Yeah, those those two just to do two kinds, two kinds.

356
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:24,309
Rym: Cut it out.

357
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:25,179
Rym: Cut it out.

358
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:41,880
Rym: So in some other news of a movie we have not seen, I assumed from the beginning, from the earliest talk of they're going there being a live action Alita Battle Angel movie, like a non anime remake.

359
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,720
Rym: I assumed it wasn't going to happen because this gets announced for every anime property.

360
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,680
Rym: How many Cowboy Bebop remakes have been announced and not made?

361
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:59,580
Scott: Well, OK, so first of all, there's a long history of people wanting to optioning, trying to make live action Americanized versions of anime movies.

362
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,340
Scott: They have done it a few times.

363
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:03,392
Scott: For example, that goes in the show movie.

364
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:04,720
Scott: that was supposedly awful.

365
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,618
Scott: I didn't see it and I won't.

366
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:12,081
Scott: But this one is different in that I was a Cameron is not the Terminator guy, I think, right?

367
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:14,219
Scott: I'm pretty sure that's the guy anyway.

368
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:16,520
Scott: Famous director guy.

369
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,338
Scott: I think it was a Terminator directing guy, but it might be I'm wrong about you.

370
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:21,466
Rym: type in James Cameron.

371
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,060
Rym: Alita literally got recommend.

372
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:23,748
Scott: I was right.

373
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:24,500
Scott: All right.

374
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:28,100
Scott: That guy must have read the Alita manga at some point.

375
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,679
Scott: I have it actually digital because you can get a digital way cheap.

376
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:31,758
Rym: And he got obsessed with it.

377
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,279
Scott: No, I haven't read it yet.

378
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:34,147
Scott: But not you.

379
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:34,977
Scott: This guy read it.

380
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:44,760
Scott: He read it a long time ago when I guess it must have first come out in English, which is actually a long time ago, and became obsessed with it and has wanted to make a movie of it for a long ass time.

381
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:49,080
Scott: And he has kept trying and it was constantly in the nerd news.

382
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,320
Scott: This guy wants to make this Alita movie.

383
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:52,191
Scott: This is happening.

384
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:52,880
Scott: He's trying.

385
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,910
Scott: He's trying real hard.

386
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,860
Scott: He's doing this other thing.

387
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,543
Scott: He's trying hard.

388
00:18:55,583 --> 00:19:00,354
Rym: Listen, James Cameron, I got a manga that you should read called Sanctuary.

389
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:00,740
Scott: Yeah.

390
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,062
Scott: Right.

391
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:03,120
Scott: I don't think that's his kind of movie.

392
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,178
Rym: Now who we need.

393
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:07,460
Rym: We need the snatch guy to read sanctuary.

394
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,008
Rym: Oh, gosh.

395
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:11,420
Scott: It would be rated X, though, I would watch.

396
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,500
Rym: I would I would see that I would watch in the theater.

397
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:17,879
Scott: It's also the exact opposite of what is what is good in the work.

398
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:18,662
Scott: Yeah.

399
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:20,191
Scott: Anyway, you want to show Mr.

400
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,460
Scott: Tokai in twenty nineteen audience.

401
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:28,300
Rym: I feel like you take a. you make it a spiritual remake, not a line for line.

402
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:30,354
Scott: I think you would have to definitely erase Mr.

403
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:31,260
Scott: Tokai's existence.

404
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:31,822
Rym: Yeah.

405
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:33,980
Rym: You changed some of that anyway.

406
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,474
Rym: Anyway.

407
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:35,819
Scott: But yeah.

408
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:44,659
Scott: So it's somewhat of a miracle that despite, you know, so few of these actually being made, the ones that are made are awful and I avoid them.

409
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:46,579
Scott: This one was made.

410
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,180
Scott: It's in theaters now and much the opposite of Gundam NT.

411
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,319
Scott: Everything I see on Twitter is positive, which is freaky.

412
00:19:55,421 --> 00:20:01,200
Rym: Even the fact that when the early shots came out like the earliest, like, wow, it's actually getting made and she had like the anime.

413
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,843
Scott: I guess she has these weird and it's canonical because that's the way the robot's made.

414
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:11,640
Rym: So apparently, against all expectation, this movie is good on its own.

415
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,584
Scott: I have not seen it.

416
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,541
Scott: It could be those people could be wrong, but I don't entirely believe.

417
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:22,780
Rym: the people I trust have said that it is both good on its own and good as being an anime like live action remake movie.

418
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,420
Scott: So it was upgraded from never watch like Ghost in the Shell live action.

419
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,678
Rym: You will watch on two.

420
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,378
Scott: We'll watch at some point.

421
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:31,240
Scott: Probably not going to go to the theater.

422
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:32,880
Rym: Yeah, but I will see this movie.

423
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,321
Rym: I am.

424
00:20:33,842 --> 00:20:40,980
Scott: Some day I'll be sitting there and I like turn on my, you know, HDBC and open to the Netflix app and the icon will be there.

425
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,477
Scott: This is like I'll be like, oh, nothing to do.

426
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:45,823
Rym: I'll watch this.

427
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:51,700
Rym: So in some last news, so we don't go to Katsucon anymore.

428
00:20:52,143 --> 00:20:54,760
Scott: We haven't been there in a long time.

429
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:07,900
Rym: The last time we went to Katsucon, we were on the staff and helped run and like emcee the arcade that it had before it was in the Gaylord when it was literally an entirely different convention.

430
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:12,380
Rym: It says Katsucon today is a ship of Theseus from the Katsucon we staffed.

431
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,041
Scott: That is true.

432
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:21,499
Scott: The arcade at the Katsucons that we went to was similar to the arcade of Magfest at the time.

433
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,301
Scott: Yeah, right.

434
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:27,504
Scott: Magfest obviously was focused on arcade and gaming and expanded that tremendously.

435
00:21:27,544 --> 00:21:30,360
Rym: But there was a time when Katsucon had an arcade.

436
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:34,960
Scott: It was in a similar location on Earth, same city, same general area.

437
00:21:35,423 --> 00:21:37,179
Scott: But that wasn't their focus.

438
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,580
Scott: And I don't think they have that anymore.

439
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:46,124
Rym: Like seriously, this anime con had an arcade that to this back then, back in like 2000, like seven.

440
00:21:46,686 --> 00:21:51,961
Rym: This arcade was better than at this anime con than any PAX arcade has ever been.

441
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:57,139
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I had more fun in that Katsucon arcade for those two times.

442
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:58,998
Scott: we did it, I think, even though it was sick one time.

443
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:10,262
Scott: Then in the Magfest arcade at the first Magfest we went to in the shady hotel, I do think that Magfest arcade had more quantity of games, but the quality of games was not as high.

444
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:15,620
Rym: So Katsucon is a like large, gigantic, well-run anime convention today.

445
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,460
Rym: It's one of the big like cosplay anime cons.

446
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,260
Rym: Like cosplay is a big focus at Katsucon.

447
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,100
Scott: It is the number one focus of Katsucon far and away.

448
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,640
Rym: Like even relative to other major anime conventions.

449
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,582
Scott: They made it.

450
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:32,980
Scott: That gazebo is famous not because of cosplay photos from Magfest, but because of cosplay photos from Katsucon.

451
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,220
Rym: Yep.

452
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,220
Scott: Now we are now in the same building, by the way, these two conventions.

453
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,048
Rym: We don't go just because.

454
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:37,980
Rym: They were not originally.

455
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:41,200
Rym: I mean, we stopped going to anime Boston because of the security nonsense.

456
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:42,185
Rym: The only reason.

457
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:46,440
Scott: Also, it's just a pain in the ass to go to Boston in the spring for three days to do like two panels.

458
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:54,180
Rym: The reason we don't go to Katsucon is because Katsucon is in the thick of like our busiest conventions season already.

459
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,980
Rym: Like it would have been this past weekend.

460
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:56,842
Rym: Like we.

461
00:22:57,825 --> 00:23:01,580
Rym: well, we realized that we go to like four ish, four to five packs a year.

462
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:04,379
Rym: And they're actually all in a pretty short span of time.

463
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:09,395
Scott: They're really like, well, it's basically everything is when it's cold and in the summer we don't do nothing.

464
00:23:09,517 --> 00:23:09,680
Scott: Yep.

465
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:18,719
Rym: We got to go to PAX in September, October, if we go to us, November, January, March and then back around to September.

466
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:28,460
Rym: So Katsucon is in the same venue as Magfest and Katsucon announced something and did something really interesting and really amazing.

467
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:34,882
Rym: I am shocked and surprised that they were able to pull this off and Magfest needs to do this.

468
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:38,120
Scott: You have to hundred percent to understand what's going on.

469
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,739
Scott: You sort of have to look at a floor plan if you haven't been there.

470
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,734
Scott: But basically, you have this big ass hotel, right?

471
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:52,580
Scott: And then at the cross to the big lobby and there's this huge downstairs area with all this like a little Christmas village, this giant gazebo area, this restaurant area.

472
00:23:53,041 --> 00:24:02,340
Scott: And then once you get to the back of the lobby is like this area where there's like stores that sell like jewelry and clothing and and there's a spa.

473
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:10,700
Scott: And you go through this tunnel where the stores on the other side of this short tunnel past the hotel elevators is the convention center.

474
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:18,662
Scott: So there's sort of like this straight line across the building where it's like you're in the hotel side, you're in the convention center side, but it's a really short tunnel.

475
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:24,079
Scott: And because the lobbies are so huge and there's all these other vast areas where the gazebo is on the hotel side.

476
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:24,602
Scott: Yeah.

477
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:24,863
Scott: Right.

478
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:29,088
Scott: And there's actually ballrooms and stuff on the right behind that gazebo.

479
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:29,779
Scott: Guess what?

480
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,362
Scott: There's like a ballroom where there's all kinds of it's like a main panel room for breakfast.

481
00:24:34,402 --> 00:24:41,474
Rym: Right now, this is a. this is one of those like issues, concerns that only exists for some of the largest of the fan can write.

482
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,629
Scott: paxies doesn't have this problem because what paxies is?

483
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,598
Scott: one giant building.

484
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:45,364
Scott: Yes, one.

485
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,540
Scott: It's just one big rectangle.

486
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,062
Scott: The end.

487
00:24:48,142 --> 00:24:48,363
Rym: Yep.

488
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:54,199
Rym: Now, there is actually a hotel directly connected to paxies, but it's got this skywalk.

489
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:55,188
Scott: So you basically are.

490
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:56,499
Rym: Well, here's the more important part.

491
00:24:56,821 --> 00:24:59,439
Rym: That hotel has no convention programming in it.

492
00:24:59,740 --> 00:24:59,881
Rym: None.

493
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:03,460
Rym: And is entirely distinct as an entity from the hotel.

494
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:06,359
Rym: Or from the convention center for purposes of pax.

495
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:07,443
Rym: Yep.

496
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:21,900
Rym: But this is a common situation where the largest conventions tend to have a hotel convention center combo where significant portions of the convention center space overlap with the hotel or are technically public areas like anime, anime.

497
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,598
Scott: Boston has stuff in the Sheraton.

498
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,203
Scott: Yeah, it's like a mall in between a shopping mall, a public shopping mall between the convention.

499
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:33,260
Scott: Pax West, the convention center is a mall with like restaurants.

500
00:25:33,903 --> 00:25:34,739
Scott: Here's what this means.

501
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:42,343
Rym: The convention staff cannot require a badge for someone to be in one of those public areas.

502
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:42,745
Scott: Right.

503
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:54,120
Scott: So like if there's some, you know, people who would go to, say, anime Boston and we're just going to do cosplay stuff in, say, the shopping mall or the Sheraton lobby, anime Boston can't really stop them.

504
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,185
Scott: Those are public places.

505
00:25:55,245 --> 00:26:02,746
Scott: If someone goes to Pax West, they don't check your badge like at the entrance to the convention because the convention center is legally public space.

506
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:03,740
Scott: It's a public mall.

507
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,504
Scott: It's a shopping mall.

508
00:26:04,524 --> 00:26:08,389
Scott: What if you want to go in and wait in a super long line with a bunch of pax goers to buy a Subway sandwich

509
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:09,193
Rym: so they can only check

510
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:17,539
Scott: the badges at these glass doors at the top of the escalators that separate that shopping mall zone from the expo hall area?

511
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,799
Rym: So Katsucon has had a problem for a long now.

512
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,642
Rym: Lobby conning, if you've never not familiar with this term, is a perfectly valid fan practice.

513
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:39,600
Rym: The idea is, say, you go to conventions mostly to hang out with your friends, play games like hotel party, whatever, and maybe only a subset of your friends actually go into the convention to like go to panels and stuff.

514
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:39,801
Scott: Right.

515
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:43,585
Scott: Or maybe so only a few of your friends, you know, you want to do things at different times.

516
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:45,120
Scott: You share some badges, save some money.

517
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:46,103
Scott: Right.

518
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:48,959
Scott: You know, it's like it's a perfectly valid thing to do.

519
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:52,640
Scott: It's not in itself wrong or should be banned entirely.

520
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:59,860
Scott: So if I happen to know that even in non nerdy conventions, maybe you go to a tech conference with charges, an arm and a leg, you don't care about the content.

521
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,827
Scott: You're just there to network.

522
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:03,006
Scott: So you hang out in the hotel bar the whole time networking.

523
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:03,780
Rym: Here's what I used to do.

524
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,579
Rym: I used to go to trade tech Paris every year.

525
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:08,400
Rym: It is really fucking expensive to go to trade tech Paris.

526
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,819
Scott: But your company, your company would pay for.

527
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,700
Rym: Well, yeah, but even then, it's really expensive.

528
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:17,522
Rym: So what we would do is I'd get a badge for like one day to actually go into trade tech Paris.

529
00:27:17,924 --> 00:27:27,044
Rym: But I'd stay in a hotel and hang out around trade tech Paris for like the entire week because all the people I need to talk to are in town at the same time.

530
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:28,760
Scott: You have private meetings with them in other places.

531
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:34,544
Rym: Like I know some people who will go to Magfest, not buy a badge, never even go into the Gaylord.

532
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:41,180
Rym: And they literally just get drunk and hang out and party in their hotel room with all their friends and some of whom are going into Magfest.

533
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,323
Scott: They're going there because a bunch of people are going to be in this area that they want to see.

534
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:55,180
Scott: So lobby counting is the practice of going to the city and or hotel where a convention is to go near a convention because you want to hang out with the people who are going to that convention.

535
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,439
Scott: But you yourself do not want to go.

536
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,758
Rym: Totally OK to do this.

537
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:20,023
Rym: However, at the Gaylord, it for various reasons, conventions that are there have a problem in that a lot of people will lobby con and a lot of those people will completely fill the technically public areas of the convention center space and generally be a nuisance, get in the way, cause fire code issues, harass people, et cetera.

538
00:28:20,043 --> 00:28:20,163
Scott: Right.

539
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:27,380
Scott: It's to the point where so many people are doing it, but actually going to the lobby there, a getting convention content without paying.

540
00:28:27,842 --> 00:28:28,144
Scott: Right.

541
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,919
Scott: You know, they've crossed that line.

542
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:30,362
Scott: Yeah.

543
00:28:30,603 --> 00:28:30,844
Scott: Right.

544
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:37,160
Scott: They are interfering with the operation of the convention and they're harming the safety of the people who did pay for the convention.

545
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,885
Scott: So if you go to a convention, you expect that convention, you know, there's an expectation these days.

546
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:44,164
Scott: the convention will provide for your security at the convention.

547
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:46,299
Scott: You need to feel safe there or you're not going to go.

548
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,463
Scott: The convention.

549
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:53,059
Scott: really only thing they can do if people don't break the law is take people's badges away and kick them out.

550
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,708
Scott: You can't really do anything to someone who's not breaking the law, maybe just hanging around being a jerk.

551
00:28:58,313 --> 00:28:59,199
Scott: What can you do to them?

552
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:00,944
Scott: Not much.

553
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:05,763
Rym: If they don't have a badge, the best you can do is get the venue to trespass them.

554
00:29:05,783 --> 00:29:06,325
Rym: Yep.

555
00:29:06,686 --> 00:29:11,782
Rym: But that is hard to do to people who don't have badges or in the hotel.

556
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:21,779
Scott: There are a wide variety of behaviors that would not get you kicked out of a hotel lobby, but also would not send you to jail and all you can.

557
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,868
Scott: But you're still a bad person.

558
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:24,914
Rym: You kicked out of packs.

559
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:25,900
Scott: Right, exactly.

560
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:30,805
Scott: And those behaviors are exhibited a lot by people going to hotel lobbies, especially nerd cons.

561
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:34,462
Rym: So Kazukan did something that I didn't know was an option.

562
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:34,926
Rym: I did not.

563
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:36,335
Scott: And I've never heard of this before either.

564
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:39,374
Rym: So I knew about this was happening at Kazukan, but now we saw the result.

565
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,911
Rym: I'm going to read their own press conference.

566
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:42,293
Rym: Too long.

567
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:42,756
Scott: Don't read it all.

568
00:29:42,796 --> 00:29:43,622
Rym: No, just the beginning of it.

569
00:29:43,964 --> 00:29:50,275
Rym: Kazukan, in coordination with the Gaylord National, have made the decision for Kazukan to be what is called a "closed profile

570
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:50,737
Rym: event.".

571
00:29:51,279 --> 00:30:07,385
Rym: This means that for the duration of the convention, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the hotel and convention center will only be accessible to either people wearing or in the process of obtaining a Kazukan badge or registered guests of the resort itself.

572
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:09,210
Rym: Full stop.

573
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,185
Scott: Or guests with confirmed restaurant or spa appointment.

574
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:13,527
Scott: Yes.

575
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:16,003
Scott: I was I was wondering, I'm like, is the restaurant going to be upset?

576
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:18,480
Scott: Apparently you can go to the restaurant if you have a reservation.

577
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:22,118
Scott: You can't just walk in to go try to wait in line at the restaurant.

578
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:28,039
Rym: So what that means is that now convention staff, Kazukan staff, can be in that area.

579
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,300
Rym: And if someone's pulling some bullshit, they can kick them out of the convention.

580
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:38,293
Scott: Or at the very least, if it's a hotel guest who doesn't have a badge to Kazukan, they just they just bought a hotel room.

581
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:40,003
Scott: They can at least report them to the hotel.

582
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:40,605
Scott: Yup.

583
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:43,876
Rym: This magfest needs this desperately.

584
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:45,883
Rym: I'm glad that Kazukan did it.

585
00:30:45,963 --> 00:31:04,857
Rym: And so far, it seems like the only people who are mad about this policy are a huge number of cosplayers who have been used taking photos inside of the convention center in that gazebo area for years without buying badges and the photographers who would follow them in to do this.

586
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:13,374
Rym: So now all these photographers and all these cosplayers are really, really mad about this and had to buy Kazukan badges.

587
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:13,796
Scott: Yeah, good.

588
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:14,379
Scott: Buy some badges.

589
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:16,105
Scott: Yeah.

590
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,611
Scott: You're mooching off the convention here.

591
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:18,395
Rym: Yup.

592
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:20,726
Rym: This is a step beyond lobby conning.

593
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:27,497
Rym: This is like con squatting at this point because of the blended public private spaces of the largest events, etc.

594
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:28,964
Rym: Anyway, you can read more about it.

595
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:30,773
Rym: Kazukan, I'm glad you did this.

596
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:33,287
Rym: Magfest, please, for the love of everything.

597
00:31:33,347 --> 00:31:34,515
Scott: I'm curious how much.

598
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:36,645
Scott: I'm curious how much extra you got to pay to get that service.

599
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:50,726
Rym: I have a feeling that due to so one, I already ran into a lot of drunk shit ass white boy bros at magfest this past year who were complaining that they couldn't get into the arcade without a badge.

600
00:31:51,268 --> 00:32:03,683
Rym: Yeah, I, based on my own personal anecdotal experience, believe that a huge percentage of the people causing the problem at magfest are only causing the problem in those public spaces and do not have badges.

601
00:32:04,627 --> 00:32:06,955
Scott: If those people, maybe not legit ones.

602
00:32:07,477 --> 00:32:07,678
Rym: Yeah.

603
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:13,828
Rym: If those people could not get into the Gaylord at all, I think magfest would have a lot less of the problem.

604
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:15,394
Scott: Magfest would be way better in general.

605
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:15,997
Rym: Yes.

606
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,401
Scott: So it couldn't hurt.

607
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:19,863
Rym: It could not hurt, but only help.

608
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:28,236
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, what do you got?

609
00:32:28,397 --> 00:32:31,637
Scott: I was just sitting around today, you know, just thinking about programming.

610
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:33,206
Scott: Cause that's what I do all fucking day.

611
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:41,272
Scott: And I, you know, my brain, I forget how it arrived at this thought, but I was thinking about, you know, programming for like old computers or consoles and whatever.

612
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:47,044
Scott: And if my brain was thinking like, you know, yeah, I know an NES game is generally structured kind of right.

613
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:50,724
Scott: I know like the limitations of the system, like how an Atari game sort of is programmed.

614
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:50,985
Scott: Right.

615
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:56,135
Scott: And then my brain was just like, I don't know how the fucking arcade game, not like a new arcade game.

616
00:32:56,155 --> 00:33:00,605
Scott: Well, not new, but like, you know, and how like a dig dug works, like how the hell is a street fighter to work?

617
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:06,936
Scott: Like what if I wanted to like make a game like a ROM that ran on the same hardware as street fighter to what the fuck does that like?

618
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:10,894
Scott: So I just Googled, I typed in like street fighters, you source code.

619
00:33:10,915 --> 00:33:12,261
Scott: I'm like, it's probably online somewhere.

620
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:19,333
Scott: And I didn't find that I found a blog of someone trying to reverse engineer street fighter two.

621
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:24,517
Scott: And there's a terrific article on this blog about the AI of street fighter two.

622
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:28,998
Scott: And I was like, that's something I always wanted to know, but didn't think of to look.

623
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:29,741
Rym: Yeah.

624
00:33:30,023 --> 00:33:33,498
Rym: Cause like the AIs and dig dug pretty simple Pac-Man pretty simple.

625
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,186
Rym: How does Ryu like get you?

626
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:35,768
Scott: Right.

627
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:39,182
Scott: So now I read this and it was fascinating.

628
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:44,282
Scott: And I have learned more about the AI of street fighter two than I knew I wanted, but I definitely wanted.

629
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:58,882
Rym: And wow, I can, you can use crappy methods like this to make some pretty good AI, I guess expert systems and basic, like if then trees with pseudo randomizers, not bad solutions to a lot of problems.

630
00:33:58,902 --> 00:33:59,846
Scott: Anyway, it's really fast.

631
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:00,550
Scott: It's also fast.

632
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:05,673
Scott: It also answered an age old question of how does guile do that flash kick without ducking?

633
00:34:05,714 --> 00:34:06,496
Scott: He must be cheating.

634
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:07,982
Scott: Answer.

635
00:34:08,141 --> 00:34:08,804
Scott: He is cheating.

636
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:16,036
Scott: A human being has to duck for two seconds to do a flash kick, but, uh, you know, guile controlled by the AI does not.

637
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:16,598
Scott: Yep.

638
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:31,913
Rym: So I've been mad about this for a long time and I was thinking about it the other day and sure enough, our good friend who is not captain disillusion, but looks a little bit like him, depending on the angle you look at him, technology connections, he a great youtube channel.

639
00:34:31,933 --> 00:34:32,899
Rym: I've linked to them every now and then.

640
00:34:33,483 --> 00:34:39,536
Rym: He did a tear down of space heaters called space heater nonsense, where he's mad about the same goddamn thing I'm mad about.

641
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:40,322
Scott: What are you mad about?

642
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:44,509
Scott: I thought your favorite thing to be mad about regarding space heaters is why did they just exist?

643
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:45,453
Scott: Just use a computer.

644
00:34:45,554 --> 00:34:47,723
Scott: It's also 100% efficient at producing heat.

645
00:34:48,024 --> 00:34:48,284
Rym: Yep.

646
00:34:48,446 --> 00:34:50,435
Rym: So it's, it's adjacent to that.

647
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:56,342
Rym: I don't want to get into my like, use your computer as a space heater, but what I would like to get into is Scott.

648
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:59,258
Rym: What makes you say you want to get a space heater?

649
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,071
Rym: Like you might've bought one at some point in your life.

650
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:03,763
Rym: What makes one of them better than another one?

651
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:06,012
Scott: Better than another one.

652
00:35:06,113 --> 00:35:10,491
Rym: How can one space heater possibly be better or different than another space here?

653
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:12,461
Scott: I guess it could be bigger, right?

654
00:35:12,481 --> 00:35:13,988
Scott: So it could heat up a bigger room.

655
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:17,781
Rym: So how could a bigger space heater heat up a bigger room?

656
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:22,181
Scott: Uh, kind of like fans on it and stuff to help distribute the heat around the room.

657
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,011
Rym: How could a fan cause a speed?

658
00:35:24,312 --> 00:35:44,477
Rym: So there is literally no matter how big, no matter how many fans, lack of fans, no matter what you do, all electric space heaters have the exact same amount of heat they can produce and thus can heat any room of any size, the same amount, full stop.

659
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:45,543
Rym: There's no fucking difference.

660
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:47,152
Rym: Nothing you do matters.

661
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:47,955
Scott: You can.

662
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:52,412
Scott: So let's say that it's, you know, it got a space here in the corner.

663
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:52,854
Scott: All right.

664
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:59,486
Scott: It's using, of course it's turning all the electricity that comes out of the holes into heat with a hundred percent efficiency.

665
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:01,414
Rym: So there's a max on that.

666
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:05,690
Rym: The amount of BTUs based on American electrical systems, right?

667
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:12,135
Scott: So now, you know, the, the area around the space heater, if it's just say a hot coil, right?

668
00:36:12,155 --> 00:36:16,134
Scott: The area around the space heater will be quite hot here on the opposite side of the room.

669
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:18,303
Scott: You will still be quite cold, right?

670
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:24,848
Scott: Ah, there's only fan to sort of not move the heat, but to you move the air, right?

671
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:28,726
Scott: So now the room is now heating more evenly, right?

672
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:33,710
Scott: Instead of being hot in the corner and cold in the opposite corner, you can get that air moving, right?

673
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,840
Scott: Cause the convection won't really happen too much.

674
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:42,044
Rym: So the room as a whole will not get warmer and added at any at a different rates.

675
00:36:42,445 --> 00:36:42,646
Scott: No.

676
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:57,101
Scott: And in fact, the opposite side of the room will be warmer sooner potentially, but not in any meaningful way for space heaters because the overall temperature of the room will not rise somehow to a higher temperature at the end.

677
00:36:57,523 --> 00:37:03,825
Rym: Space heaters can't output enough heat for that fandom matter in any reasonably sized room.

678
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:06,015
Rym: They don't output that much heat.

679
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,234
Rym: There's a pretty low limit on how much heat they can output it.

680
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:12,731
Scott: I guess you can make a space heater that plugs into more outlets at once.

681
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:13,634
Scott: That is illegal.

682
00:37:13,895 --> 00:37:16,164
Scott: I'm aware, but you could do it.

683
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:18,795
Rym: So you could plug in more space heaters.

684
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:26,790
Rym: A lot of space heaters try to argue that they're designed for a large room versus a small room or they're designed for efficiency.

685
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:28,197
Rym: That's all made up bullshit.

686
00:37:28,218 --> 00:37:29,364
Rym: They all have a BTU rating.

687
00:37:29,405 --> 00:37:30,229
Rym: That's it full stop.

688
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:41,670
Rym: And in fact, if you have a fan, you might say, Oh, maybe the fan takes away some of the energy that would go into making heat, but that fan will itself, all the energy, the fan is going to move the air will also generate heat.

689
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,493
Rym: Exactly.

690
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:58,857
Rym: The only possible difference between a space, two space heaters you plug in would be if they're going to heat the air in the room via convection or ran a heating coil, or are they going to generate an infrared spotlight that you're going to point at your own body.

691
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:02,072
Scott: because infrared heaters, are there ones that do that?

692
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:02,555
Scott: Yeah.

693
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:03,579
Scott: I never heard of that.

694
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,488
Scott: I guess it would totally work.

695
00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:08,781
Rym: Let me find a picture of one red space.

696
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:11,933
Scott: I mean, why don't not just get like, uh, you know, a lamp.

697
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,026
Rym: They basically are a lamp that you point at yourself.

698
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:15,950
Rym: All right.

699
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:18,256
Rym: And they will give you cancer.

700
00:38:18,537 --> 00:38:23,978
Rym: No, they will basically warm you up at the expense of warming up the room.

701
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:25,626
Rym: They will not warm up the room.

702
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,499
Scott: So if the room is losing, you got to aim it at you.

703
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:29,001
Rym: Yes.

704
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:29,664
Rym: Aim it at you.

705
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:39,240
Rym: You will feel warm, even though the room itself is not actually make a transparent slash translucent chair that has lamps all under it.

706
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,226
Rym: That's not a bad idea.

707
00:38:41,246 --> 00:38:45,603
Scott: Just saying, it'll be like, it'll be sort of like heated seats in the car.

708
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:52,936
Scott: Only, uh, possibly safer because it just lamps and not, you know, I don't know, not the heated seats in a car or a danger.

709
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,162
Scott: I don't even know.

710
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:58,583
Scott: I've never seen anyone like, Oh my God, my heated car seat set on fire.

711
00:38:58,603 --> 00:38:59,989
Scott: That's never happened.

712
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:06,509
Rym: That's the only possible argument one could make is that shittier space heaters are more likely to catch on fire and or kill you because they're shittier.

713
00:39:06,549 --> 00:39:07,273
Scott: That is very true.

714
00:39:07,354 --> 00:39:08,338
Rym: Like cheaper components.

715
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:09,122
Scott: Extremely true.

716
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:11,233
Rym: So anyway, this video is 20 minutes.

717
00:39:11,273 --> 00:39:13,383
Scott: Like the one that you can plug into two hours at once.

718
00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:17,828
Rym: Well, like my old DOS keyboard that had to plug into two USB ports at once.

719
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:18,834
Scott: I've had keyboards like that.

720
00:39:19,055 --> 00:39:20,001
Rym: That is bad news.

721
00:39:20,182 --> 00:39:20,423
Scott: Yep.

722
00:39:20,564 --> 00:39:21,630
Rym: That is against the USB spec.

723
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:27,168
Rym: Anyway, this video is 20 minutes of explaining this in the meta moment.

724
00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:31,363
Rym: We are going to be live at PAX East in like 36 days.

725
00:39:31,684 --> 00:39:32,065
Scott: Okay.

726
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:36,058
Rym: Doing a panel on Friday called the real harm of game.

727
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:37,744
Scott: I started to outline it.

728
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:41,637
Rym: I found some Nora citations we can use.

729
00:39:41,677 --> 00:39:43,429
Rym: I found some stories and anecdotes and things.

730
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:44,072
Scott: Send me that then.

731
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:44,594
Rym: I will.

732
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:49,030
Rym: Uh, otherwise we are book club book 2001 A Space Odyssey.

733
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:49,711
Rym: I am.

734
00:39:49,912 --> 00:39:52,745
Scott: I am due to finish reading this book tomorrow.

735
00:39:52,825 --> 00:40:00,638
Rym: There is a good chance Thursday next week we will do the book club book episode on 2000. after all this time I'm going to start reading.

736
00:40:00,658 --> 00:40:02,207
Scott: It took me like no time to read it.

737
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:03,955
Scott: Also, I'm gonna.

738
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:07,510
Scott: my goal is to stick with my kindle train strategy and never stop.

739
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:16,340
Scott: Like if I read all the books I have in the kindle app, buy more books because you can only raise for so much galaxy to stop playing games on my phone on the train entirely, hopefully.

740
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,178
Scott: But of course, by summer, my reading might go down as I bike instead of subway.

741
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,869
Rym: So let's get it right to our main bit.

742
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,511
Rym: We got.

743
00:40:23,892 --> 00:40:28,608
Rym: there was a manga by the great Osamu Jessica called Dororo.

744
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:31,201
Scott: I read it when it came out in English, published by vertical.

745
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:32,468
Scott: That was a while ago.

746
00:40:32,488 --> 00:40:33,854
Scott: I remember too much.

747
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:35,823
Scott: I only remember the basics from reading it.

748
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:41,023
Scott: Uh, but this manga was adapted into an anime way back in the day.

749
00:40:41,203 --> 00:40:43,850
Rym: And I want to say 1969.

750
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:49,999
Scott: It's one of those manga that's sort of like on this like semi fame level where like it's it's known but not super.

751
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,309
Rym: no like manga comic people will know.

752
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:58,285
Scott: But like average American anime that I'm really curious like what percentage of Japanese people will know it if you just bring it up.

753
00:40:58,587 --> 00:40:59,573
Scott: But they know what you're talking about.

754
00:40:59,673 --> 00:40:59,914
Scott: Yeah.

755
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:01,341
Scott: Like how known is it there?

756
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:01,662
Scott: Yep.

757
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:01,803
Scott: 1969.

758
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:06,883
Scott: Obviously not as known as Astro, but not unknown.

759
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,248
Rym: Anyway, the manga was made.

760
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:14,753
Rym: It was, you know, it was a testicle moderately famous that in 1969 a black and white anime was made.

761
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:16,820
Rym: Uh, I've never seen it.

762
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:18,907
Rym: I know almost nothing about it.

763
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:27,345
Rym: All I can say is that there is, in fact, an anime news network article about it and it has very high ratings among the 15 people who have seen it.

764
00:41:28,108 --> 00:41:30,239
Scott: So anyway, they came out this season.

765
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:36,292
Scott: We judged anime and I noticed while we were judging anime, by the way, judge anime by its cover next episode, we're going to do.

766
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:40,532
Scott: The next season starts in early April, PAX East of the last week of March.

767
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:47,382
Scott: So probably like right after PAX East, either right before or right after PAX East, we're going to judge anime again.

768
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:50,778
Scott: Antichart.net already seems to be well on its way towards updating.

769
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:54,033
Scott: Anyway, we noticed last season we were judging anime.

770
00:41:54,053 --> 00:42:02,269
Scott: There's a new Dororo TV series, so a new adaptation of the Dororo manga into anime with, you know, that was made this year right now.

771
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:03,334
Scott: It's airing currently.

772
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:06,230
Scott: I think seven episodes have already aired as of this podcast.

773
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:06,751
Rym: Yep.

774
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:08,098
Rym: I have seen three.

775
00:42:08,118 --> 00:42:09,545
Scott: I think I've seen two or three.

776
00:42:09,565 --> 00:42:10,068
Scott: I don't remember.

777
00:42:10,088 --> 00:42:11,173
Rym: Do you see these three?

778
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:11,876
Rym: Yeah.

779
00:42:12,037 --> 00:42:13,845
Rym: Do you saw the, uh, the village with the lady?

780
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:13,926
Rym: Yes.

781
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:15,313
Rym: Yeah.

782
00:42:15,696 --> 00:42:17,689
Rym: And then the next one is the doctor's back story.

783
00:42:19,892 --> 00:42:21,018
Rym: The guy who made the prosthesis.

784
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,124
Scott: Yes, I saw that.

785
00:42:22,265 --> 00:42:22,667
Rym: Okay.

786
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:23,652
Rym: We've seen about the same amount.

787
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:24,377
Rym: Okay.

788
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,181
Rym: We we've seen enough.

789
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:26,066
Rym: You've read the manga.

790
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:26,609
Rym: I have not.

791
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,617
Rym: So you know a lot more than me.

792
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:28,886
Scott: I died, but I have much.

793
00:42:28,906 --> 00:42:29,691
Scott: Do I remember the manga?

794
00:42:29,872 --> 00:42:30,515
Scott: Yeah.

795
00:42:31,097 --> 00:42:33,086
Scott: It's only, it's actually not a very long manga.

796
00:42:33,146 --> 00:42:33,849
Scott: Tezuka wise.

797
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,873
Scott: It's only like a few volumes.

798
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:45,578
Scott: Uh, but yeah, so basically the story of Doro is kind of a crazy and unique story is that there was this dude, he was some sort of like samurai Lord kind of guy.

799
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:45,961
Rym: Yep.

800
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:50,628
Scott: And you know, like those guys that are always trying to increase their social standing and, and such and such.

801
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:57,143
Rym: So like you do, he goes to the temple at the gates of hell and asked the 12 right near his house is a temple on the mountain.

802
00:42:57,586 --> 00:43:01,363
Scott: And that temple on the mountain is not a temple of nice gods or buddhas.

803
00:43:01,384 --> 00:43:03,454
Scott: It's a temple of horrible evil demon.

804
00:43:03,655 --> 00:43:07,619
Rym: There's basically this one monk there who's like, stay the fuck away from castle lemon grab.

805
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,695
Scott: He's like, I'm basically here because I'm protecting this place.

806
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:15,998
Scott: He goes in there and he's like, oh, demons help me out and make me fucking awesome.

807
00:43:16,058 --> 00:43:17,547
Scott: Like go down to the crossroads.

808
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:18,976
Scott: Let me be awesome at guitar.

809
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:21,652
Scott: This is all, this is like, I'll give you anything awesome demons.

810
00:43:21,713 --> 00:43:26,174
Scott: Meanwhile, his wife is pregnant and the demons are like, I take your baby.

811
00:43:26,456 --> 00:43:27,380
Rym: You said anything.

812
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:28,424
Scott: He doesn't care.

813
00:43:28,465 --> 00:43:29,409
Scott: He's just fucking evil.

814
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:30,956
Scott: He's like, I take my baby.

815
00:43:31,056 --> 00:43:31,257
Rym: Yep.

816
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:35,497
Rym: Kills the monk, makes a deal with these demons and the demons are like, let's roll.

817
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:36,662
Scott: Yeah, sure thing.

818
00:43:36,802 --> 00:43:41,720
Scott: So this baby basically has all of its body parts stolen by demons.

819
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:44,549
Scott: Yet somehow it's not dead.

820
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:52,041
Scott: It has like, just, it doesn't even have skin and eyeless, mouthless, like earless, noseless, skinless body.

821
00:43:52,142 --> 00:43:55,394
Scott: It makes no sense that it's alive, but it's an anime and a manga.

822
00:43:55,414 --> 00:43:56,097
Scott: So whatever.

823
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:58,588
Scott: So it has almost no organs left.

824
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:02,286
Rym: And the Lord is like, oh, I guess the demons, that's what they wanted.

825
00:44:02,487 --> 00:44:03,070
Rym: All right, whatever.

826
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,015
Rym: I'm going to be King.

827
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:04,921
Rym: I'll make another baby.

828
00:44:05,122 --> 00:44:06,190
Rym: These are real easy to make.

829
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,513
Scott: This baby pulls a Moses and goes down the river in a boat and somehow it survives.

830
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:27,378
Scott: And somehow in addition to surviving it, like actually, you know, manages to live some kind of life and eventually it figures out that, hey, if I find these demons and slay them, then it seems like the demons must have like divvied up the body parts.

831
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,775
Scott: Like there is an eyeball for you and a brain for you and a skin for you.

832
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:38,226
Rym: So it's like a reverse Castlevania two or Dracula's going around killing people to get his body parts back, right?

833
00:44:38,306 --> 00:44:44,379
Scott: It's like you are Dracula trying to get your body parts back except you're good and you're killing demons to get the good body parts back.

834
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:44,660
Scott: Yep.

835
00:44:45,203 --> 00:44:50,145
Scott: But Doro, the car, I guess the characters, you know, that's not Doro.

836
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:51,672
Rym: No, it's just this guy.

837
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:53,359
Scott: Uh, right.

838
00:44:53,379 --> 00:44:57,680
Scott: So that's like the focus is that story of this, of this baby trying to get his body parts back.

839
00:44:57,841 --> 00:44:57,982
Scott: Right.

840
00:44:58,023 --> 00:44:59,772
Scott: And maybe get revenge on dad eventually.

841
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:00,474
Scott: Right.

842
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:09,387
Scott: The other players here are this kid who sort of discovers and make friends with, you know, missing body part person.

843
00:45:09,528 --> 00:45:14,211
Rym: This kid's introduction is basically he just scammed the hell out of a bunch of dudes.

844
00:45:14,552 --> 00:45:14,793
Scott: Yep.

845
00:45:15,355 --> 00:45:18,947
Rym: He's basically just as like wandering drifter scammer.

846
00:45:19,087 --> 00:45:20,753
Rym: kid throws rocks at people.

847
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:36,775
Scott: There is a doctor who committed war crimes and felt really bad about it and thus began a life of creating prosthetics, which he would then give to, you know, the victims of wars and also the corpses of wars who are missing body parts.

848
00:45:36,815 --> 00:45:43,405
Scott: He's got to the battlefield and put legs on corpses that lost their leg and stuff, uh, to atone for his sins.

849
00:45:43,786 --> 00:45:53,611
Scott: And he also helps out the person who is trying to get their body parts back with giving them some prosthetics that allow them to function prosthetics with swords in them.

850
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:54,839
Rym: It's not much of a spoiler.

851
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:56,489
Scott: That's how you get the demons.

852
00:45:56,569 --> 00:46:00,765
Rym: You learned that he is basically a body part missing.

853
00:46:01,026 --> 00:46:01,448
Rym: Good guy.

854
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:04,121
Rym: You can't see here, talk, smell, touch, feel, taste or anything.

855
00:46:04,604 --> 00:46:08,801
Rym: All they can do is sense demons and sense good people.

856
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:10,508
Rym: and he knows the difference between the two.

857
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:16,541
Rym: and he's got swords in all his product, swords everywhere, just sorts in him and there's various other people along the way.

858
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:20,382
Scott: Like there's actually a brother that was born after the deal with the demons.

859
00:46:20,422 --> 00:46:24,741
Rym: He made his wife pregnant again and that babies are real easy to make the demons.

860
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:25,886
Scott: did that brother.

861
00:46:26,107 --> 00:46:27,915
Scott: I think I remember is kind of evil.

862
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:30,528
Rym: Maybe I blame his upbringing eventually.

863
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:31,493
Scott: I guess a conflict there.

864
00:46:31,513 --> 00:46:31,814
Scott: Yeah.

865
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,281
Scott: Evil dad, evil son, whatever.

866
00:46:33,723 --> 00:46:38,203
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, it's, it's all about this adventure tale that goes on.

867
00:46:38,223 --> 00:46:40,252
Scott: So the anime is pretty well made.

868
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:45,861
Scott: You know, the animation is, is decent, is not crazy, good, amazing, but it doesn't have any like horrible problems.

869
00:46:45,921 --> 00:46:46,525
Scott: It's good.

870
00:46:46,566 --> 00:46:47,149
Rym: It feels good.

871
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:47,612
Rym: It looks good.

872
00:46:47,673 --> 00:46:48,357
Rym: It's serviceable.

873
00:46:48,377 --> 00:46:49,645
Rym: It's better than most anime.

874
00:46:49,665 --> 00:47:00,202
Scott: The story is just as compelling as it was in the manga, except the manga was a Tezuka manga and therefore has lots and lots of ridiculous slapstick comedy nonsense that is completely absent from the anime.

875
00:47:00,222 --> 00:47:08,362
Scott: They pretty much just took only the serious parts of the manga and only turned those into an anime and left the rest of the manga where it was on the page.

876
00:47:08,482 --> 00:47:09,627
Rym: That's where this shines.

877
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:16,075
Rym: Like if you want to experience the drama of a Tezuka, this is a really good anime to watch three episodes in.

878
00:47:16,457 --> 00:47:17,623
Rym: I'm actually really into it.

879
00:47:17,984 --> 00:47:24,135
Rym: It's it's just, I think what I like the most is that it's just the good part, but also it's not that the comedy is a bad part.

880
00:47:24,537 --> 00:47:27,310
Scott: It's just, it's a really, you know, it feels old.

881
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:32,959
Rym: The comedy is toned down and makes more sense in the context of the world in this anime than it does in the manga.

882
00:47:33,943 --> 00:47:41,222
Scott: And also, if you've read any Tezuka manga, you know, the kind of comedy that's in there, like, you know, random, weird, kooky characters, all alone.

883
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:47,451
Rym: None of that dude in ancient times pulls out like a modern telephone for some reason, for one gag, that kind of stuff.

884
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:48,476
Scott: None of that is in here.

885
00:47:48,537 --> 00:47:49,200
Scott: They took it all out.

886
00:47:49,461 --> 00:47:49,662
Rym: Yep.

887
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:59,346
Rym: But it also, the character designs, because Tezuka character designs, they'll be like the serious ones, but also the kind of like really iconic kind of weird ones.

888
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,627
Rym: It tones that down, but takes the right parts to where, parts to where.

889
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:13,125
Rym: the character designs and the sets and everything, they evoke Tezuka's style without cleaving too closely to Tezuka and making it look weird.

890
00:48:13,908 --> 00:48:15,917
Rym: It looks good for a modern sensibility.

891
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:19,194
Scott: It doesn't, like the way the Metropolis movie looks like a Tezuka thing.

892
00:48:19,495 --> 00:48:20,138
Scott: This does not.

893
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:20,880
Scott: Yes.

894
00:48:21,242 --> 00:48:30,158
Rym: But if you know Tezuka stuff, you'll see the Tezuka in it, but it won't distract a non Tezuka aficionado from the very compelling good story.

895
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:30,339
Rym: Right.

896
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:36,894
Scott: So now the thing about the story is that it's structured in such a way, it's like there's episodes for each body part.

897
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:38,627
Scott: they're trying to get back, there's like an episode.

898
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:39,772
Rym: Kill a demon, get a body part.

899
00:48:39,832 --> 00:48:40,033
Rym: Right.

900
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:49,010
Scott: So that structure makes the story actually quite similar to something like Mushishi, where each demon is different, right?

901
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,154
Scott: They're on a journey.

902
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:54,070
Scott: They stop at places and encounter some situation.

903
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:55,979
Scott: It's like, oh, what's happening here?

904
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,786
Rym: Oh, this town is beset by a monster and like the lady who runs the town needs them to go kill it.

905
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:00,968
Scott: Yeah.

906
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:04,267
Scott: Why is this town so wealthy in the middle of nowhere with no business?

907
00:49:04,388 --> 00:49:05,213
Scott: What's going on here?

908
00:49:05,334 --> 00:49:15,606
Scott: And obviously it's a demon that's holding onto a body part, but they sort of, each episode, you know, you're sort of, they have to like solve the riddle of this demon, figure out what's going on here.

909
00:49:16,008 --> 00:49:24,528
Scott: The same way, you know, Mushishi figures out what's going on or the same way Kitaro figures out what's going on and then solves, you know, the Yokai situation.

910
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:25,332
Scott: that's happening.

911
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:28,550
Scott: Or, you know, it's always, it's the same kind of structure.

912
00:49:29,732 --> 00:49:30,415
Scott: Go on a journey.

913
00:49:30,515 --> 00:49:38,210
Scott: Even, even galaxy express the same structure, arrive at a planet, face a moral quandary, deal with it, leave and go to the next place.

914
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:38,531
Scott: Right.

915
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:44,835
Scott: So the Dororo is like, well, they go to the next place on their journey around Japan.

916
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:48,207
Scott: They encounter a demon situation and figure it out.

917
00:49:48,508 --> 00:49:48,729
Rym: Yep.

918
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:53,047
Rym: And meanwhile, the, the non Dororo, the other guy forgot his name.

919
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:59,935
Rym: I forget all the characters, I think anyway, but he bit by bit as he gets more body parts, becomes more and more of a human.

920
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:00,417
Scott: Yep.

921
00:50:01,482 --> 00:50:05,461
Scott: So it gets more exciting later when, you know, it's like getting some real body parts back.

922
