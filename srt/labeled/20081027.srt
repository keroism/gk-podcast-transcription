1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,987
Rym: Hey, it's Thursday October 23rd.

2
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:12,709
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:14,634
Scott: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:15,415
Scott: It's a Thursday.

5
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:17,099
Rym: We talk about the dorms at RIT.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,928
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,412
Rym: So we're playing burning wheel as we do when the physicals calm.

8
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:37,723
Rym: It's one of those burning weekends and Power goes out.

9
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:40,193
Scott: You should have a convention called the burning weekend.

10
00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:46,574
Rym: Maybe I'll just burning wheel only convention Or maybe we'll have the burning wheel track at Connecticut.

11
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:51,629
Rym: We'll call that the burning weekend Possible Probable, I think we're gonna have to do it.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,836
Rym: Anyway, so we're playing burning wheel and Various reasons we started late as opposed to early.

13
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:02,700
Rym: so, you know It's like seven or eight o'clock at night and we're still kind of just barely getting into the game.

14
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:07,135
Rym: people are just really getting into it and then All the power goes out.

15
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:10,913
Rym: And you know, whatever the power goes out our to play burning wheel.

16
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:13,383
Scott: You can't see the die roll You just need light.

17
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:17,117
Scott: Well, yeah, I played some candlelight burning wheel, you know, we tried that.

18
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:17,860
Rym: we learned something.

19
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:20,170
Rym: One candle we had that Emily lent to us.

20
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,014
Rym: Yeah.

21
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:22,078
Scott: Well, you only had one candle.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,223
Scott: That was the problem.

23
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:24,748
Rym: candles aren't really that useful.

24
00:01:24,788 --> 00:01:27,939
Rym: the amount of light they give is not enough to do it.

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,976
Scott: Well, there's a lot of can they only an actual physical candle only gives up one candle power.

26
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:36,277
Scott: That's why you need a candelabra.

27
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:38,892
Rym: Well, no, what you really need is a lantern.

28
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,460
Rym: you see maybe just I grew up in Michigan.

29
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,947
Scott: We had like ten candles.

30
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,820
Rym: We had the kind of ready for a power outage kid.

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,293
Rym: We had like seven or eight Coleman Lanards ready to go.

32
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:48,399
Rym: the second the power went out.

33
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:53,200
Rym: But you know, we didn't have that at Alex's house and he found his one LED flashlight.

34
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:56,240
Rym: So we put it on the table pointed at the ceiling.

35
00:01:56,924 --> 00:02:06,671
Rym: But you know actually before that the real thing is whatever the power goes that you always think Alright, it's gonna come back on everyone Just kind of waits like, you know Everyone stops talking and ever just waits like our lives have stopped.

36
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:09,800
Rym: the power is gonna come back on lives continue.

37
00:02:10,383 --> 00:02:11,876
Scott: And that would be something why you know.

38
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:16,240
Scott: Ever the lights in your house like light fixtures right run off electricity.

39
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,786
Scott: Someone should make a chandelier right.

40
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:21,380
Scott: that has a battery in it and the you know, so like a little UPS.

41
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,105
Scott: I think that'd be cool.

42
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:26,060
Scott: Not like every light in your house, but like just a few key lights.

43
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:26,763
Scott: You know.

44
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:33,600
Scott: that way if the power goes out those lights will be on sort of like the emergency lights and office buildings But for a house and they would look good like a chandelier looks good.

45
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,620
Rym: I have a feeling there are numerous problems.

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,080
Scott: The only problem I see is the battery, you know weighing down on the ceiling also just having the battery having to convert it.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,844
Rym: There's a lot of problems, but you know, you have that moment the power goes out and you think alright It's gonna come back on.

48
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:51,904
Rym: and then there's that other moment when the power hasn't come back on yet and you realize Okay.

49
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:53,559
Rym: Now I have to do something about this.

50
00:02:54,901 --> 00:03:02,260
Rym: So we go outside and we're like, well, I wonder if the power is out for everyone, you know, no The power at least at that point was on for everyone.

51
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,300
Rym: But the building we were in as far as we could tell really because I was gonna say I was not over there.

52
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:15,602
Scott: So I didn't experience the power outage, but on my way to work this morning, you know there's the light on the corner of Verplank and 9d.

53
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:19,799
Scott: Yeah, right where the Country Club is and I got there to make a left turn.

54
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:28,839
Rym: You know You're screwed and it was Blinking red in all directions trying to get out to drive around that whole night because there's the intersection right there by Emily and Alex's apartments.

55
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:33,573
Rym: Nobody in the world knows to stop when the from the light isn't working.

56
00:03:33,654 --> 00:03:37,248
Rym: if you will just driving through and yeah Nobody stopped on the blinking red.

57
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:45,020
Rym: usually, you know to assert my right-of-way I literally flash my lights laid on the horn and just pulled into the intersection forced everyone to stop.

58
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:48,160
Scott: I just waited until it was safe and luckily it was in time for the train.

59
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:55,488
Scott: But usually my experience has been that people stop on the blinking red, but maybe it wasn't blinking red in the other direction But it was blinking red in mind.

60
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,962
Rym: Oh, no, the one by us wasn't even on See.

61
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:00,429
Rym: I figured out what happened there.

62
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:17,959
Rym: as far as I've always been able to tell there are two Relatively separate power grids and beacon because you kind of see like there's one set of wires that comes over from Fishkill But there's this other set of wires that comes over from like the other side through beacon and a lot of times I've seen like half of beacons power go out and the other half be up.

63
00:04:18,923 --> 00:04:28,775
Rym: It's kind of weird, but I guess the apartments and the geek house are on two separate circuits or two separate grids because The power doesn't seem to go out in both at the same time.

64
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:34,298
Scott: There's a great website I wish I could remember and the website was pretty much like why does my neighbor have power?

65
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:42,265
Scott: and I don't Told you like this little map of like a sample power grid and how they're laid out and it said if the breakage is Here, right?

66
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:44,275
Scott: This is the houses that will lose power.

67
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,300
Scott: Isn't that crazy?

68
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,534
Scott: That's why your neighbor has power and you don't.

69
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:48,360
Scott: and it was really interesting.

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,232
Rym: I thought Rod Serling answered that question much more aptly cuz you're in the Twilight Zone.

71
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:53,776
Rym: You don't remember that episode.

72
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:56,479
Rym: Oh Wow, maybe that was.

73
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:58,986
Rym: Maybe that was too inside baseball.

74
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:02,335
Rym: Maybe I. maybe I've gotten beyond your own grass.

75
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:03,920
Scott: I remember a lot of twilight zones.

76
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,379
Scott: I don't remember anyone with power going out.

77
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:14,215
Rym: It was the one where there's a bunch of people, you know during the Cold War whatever like a lot of Twilight Zones were Power goes out and everyone's houses and it stays out.

78
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:15,120
Rym: So people all walk out.

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,069
Rym: They're like, ah, you know townie folk.

80
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,073
Rym: Let's all have a talk.

81
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:21,910
Rym: Let's hang out be on the porches And then they start getting you know little worried.

82
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,875
Rym: Why is the power still out?

83
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:23,539
Rym: What's going on?

84
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:29,880
Rym: and then the power just turns on for one dude's house and They start thinking well, why is his power on?

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,144
Rym: He must be a communist.

86
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:34,477
Rym: and it ends with like everyone shooting each other and freaking out.

87
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:35,139
Scott: That's how?

88
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:36,343
Rym: yeah No, that is I come.

89
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:40,920
Rym: then it pans back to the aliens and they're like humans are so easy to conquer.

90
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:41,460
Rym: Check it out.

91
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:48,760
Rym: All we got to do is turn off the lights Flick a couple on and off like a few switches and they kill each other and then they laugh and it fades to black.

92
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,265
Rym: Yeah, I guess I spoiled it.

93
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:52,791
Scott: There was an outer limits.

94
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:55,540
Scott: that it's something similar where at the end depends the aliens.

95
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:56,844
Rym: Oh the outer limits.

96
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:57,225
Rym: the show.

97
00:05:57,265 --> 00:06:00,636
Rym: that was largely the Twilight Zone done slightly worse.

98
00:06:00,676 --> 00:06:01,820
Scott: try to remember which one it was.

99
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:02,644
Scott: Oh, whatever.

100
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,934
Rym: Did you ever watch the remake of the outer limits?

101
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:05,497
Scott: I didn't know.

102
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:06,100
Scott: there was a remake.

103
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:07,967
Rym: Oh, it was on in the late 90s.

104
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:10,597
Rym: I think oh god, it actually wasn't that bad.

105
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:12,543
Scott: Oh god All right.

106
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:13,205
Rym: What do you want?

107
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:13,908
Rym: It wasn't that bad?

108
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,234
Rym: Hey, all right.

109
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,579
Rym: So what do you got in the news?

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,804
Scott: All right, so, you know No, what things are not so good in the economics ways, you know, but tech people were thinking It's not gonna hurt tech people right?

111
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:26,926
Scott: tech has been okay.

112
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:32,337
Scott: internet's still good, right and For some reasons they were right there back in the 90s, right?

113
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:44,618
Scott: The big problem was that all those web, you know web 1.0 companies from the dot-com era They were spending bajillions of dollars buying big fancy offices hiring tons of people.

114
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:45,762
Rym: not even just that I mean work.

115
00:06:45,802 --> 00:07:03,298
Rym: there is this office culture then where if you were one of those companies It was kind of expected that you had multiple air hockey tables and foosball tables and The major expense was hiring people at $80,000 a year because they knew HTML and private jets and every.

116
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:03,520
Scott: you know.

117
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,564
Scott: People were just going nuts.

118
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,673
Scott: and that's the reason that there was a huge crash.

119
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:09,110
Scott: is because people just spent money like well No, it was.

120
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,678
Scott: there was no tomorrow.

121
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:17,240
Rym: Actually, no The reason there was a crash is because the bubble happened that all that stuff was not what caused the crash.

122
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:19,347
Rym: That was the result of the bubble.

123
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,434
Rym: right that extra money was there.

124
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:24,718
Rym: spending that money or not spending that money The crash would have happened the same.

125
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:29,360
Scott: Well, no, but the thing is if they hadn't let's say you had a dot-com company, right?

126
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,652
Scott: And let's say you had spent your money reasonably instead of ludicrous.

127
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:39,194
Rym: You're gonna have to assume this begs the question Yeah that your company has something worthwhile to sell and most of them did not.

128
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:48,131
Scott: but in the crash when it came You would have maybe been able to survive as some companies did for example The companies that had a product right?

129
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:52,140
Scott: Well, you'd have to have a product anyway, but you know Most of those companies didn't have products.

130
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:53,345
Rym: There were some companies.

131
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:57,120
Scott: think about if you didn't they were selling that you could afford to pay people for a few more months.

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,240
Scott: You would have gone out of business later.

133
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:15,680
Scott: But anyway, so you spend a few more months making a HTML for people because people nowadays are not IPO in really at all And because they're only they're spending money reasonably the web 2.0 companies Because the web 2.0 companies spend their money reasonably and not unreasonably.

134
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:19,529
Scott: They're having hard times, but they're not dead.

135
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,191
Scott: Right?

136
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:23,280
Scott: So we're seeing now is we're seeing Google cut back.

137
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,926
Scott: They're not buying as many servers.

138
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:33,913
Scott: They're not laying anyone off, but they're not buying servers like they used to right and Some of the web 2.0 companies are just laying off a few people.

139
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:40,220
Scott: now this you know, okay It's only really a news for me because it's sort of like I want to work at a cool company.

140
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:43,494
Scott: Ah shit, all the cool companies are laying people off and not hiring.

141
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:46,760
Scott: Oh, well, I'll just you know Stick with what I got until things get better.

142
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:53,359
Scott: But there's one particular story of layoffs that is pretty cold and I think I got to bring it out here.

143
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:56,581
Scott: Start revision 3 which is you know The.

144
00:08:56,943 --> 00:09:01,519
Scott: I guess it's owned or closely related to dig and they make all those video shows and whatnot, right?

145
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:07,466
Scott: There was a show called I think pop siren, right?

146
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,331
Rym: I've heard that word.

147
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:10,434
Rym: I don't know what it is.

148
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:12,160
Scott: Yeah, I think it was some sort of.

149
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:15,820
Scott: It was a show with someone named Sarah Lane, right?

150
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,222
Scott: And I never.

151
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:17,672
Scott: I never knew who Sarah Lane was.

152
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:18,799
Scott: I never watched that show.

153
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:42,600
Scott: But on twit that I listened to yesterday Sarah Lane was on someone I didn't know until this morning and Sarah Lane is the was the lifestyle programming director for revision 3 and She was on to it for the first time yesterday and she was talking about how she was gonna co-host like dig real something something and whatever and Then today the day after doing the to it.

154
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,740
Scott: Well, I guess she's not gonna co-host the something something because they laid her her and some other people off.

155
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,549
Scott: Wow, of course and that is that is pretty cold.

156
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:56,108
Rym: laying off that sort of talent usually means that you really Didn't have much of a viable business anywhere.

157
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,612
Rym: You're basically just riding that wave.

158
00:09:58,013 --> 00:09:58,595
Scott: Yeah, they are.

159
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:00,400
Scott: they laid off some pretty big talent here.

160
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:14,140
Scott: I think they laid off like Martin Sargent and some other semi-famous people and they cancelled three or four of their shows and You know, it's they're basically only keeping the you know, the top top stuff and you know cutting back everything else.

161
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,900
Rym: Well, I can safely say that there will be no layoffs here at GeekNights or the front row crew just yet.

162
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:22,100
Rym: The funniest though Scott Johnson might have to give him a pay cut.

163
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:24,367
Scott: Yeah The funniest thing is they'll be like that hit.

164
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:28,080
Scott: you read these stories and it's like such-and-such company lays off 10%.

165
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,869
Scott: You're like, oh my god 10%.

166
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:39,839
Scott: Yes Yes, like three people, okay Yeah, because they're actually small companies, you know, not like the dot-com companies which were too big for their own whatnot.

167
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:46,280
Scott: So I Just think it's pretty interesting You know because it's like a small company lays off these people.

168
00:10:46,300 --> 00:11:01,111
Scott: It's like everyone at the company is someone with a name that you would know if you paid attention to what the company does and it's You know It's like everyone at the company is a face of the company and it's pretty interesting when you see layoffs of that nature as opposed To the faceless, you know, Yahoo lays off 500.

169
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:08,700
Rym: Well, it's like I don't know who any of those people are Of course, uh, what's really gonna be interesting is seeing if this continues.

170
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:16,571
Rym: I mean at least New York hasn't been as affected by this as a lot of other places in the country just because There's a lot of I mean other than the banks themselves.

171
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,880
Rym: like the people are actually going out of business around here.

172
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:27,520
Rym: Things are things are still pretty good and I haven't seen Craigslist change too much other than I guess all the Lehman Brothers people Think it's gonna happen at least in the tech industry, right?

173
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,077
Scott: Is there a lot of you know, because these companies can't afford it right like Yahoo laid off 500 people.

174
00:11:33,162 --> 00:11:48,698
Scott: not all those people are gonna be wicked talented, but some of them are and All the companies that like couldn't get talent like they were having a hard time finding people are now gonna scoop all these people up and all the companies that were having hard times lose everyone and then all the people without talent are gonna be jobless.

175
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:49,742
Rym: I can I Can at least

176
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:50,444
Scott: say happy job

177
00:11:50,525 --> 00:12:00,501
Rym: in IT that that is very very much the case at least around here because you know We we may or may not be looking to hire someone and I've interviewed a bunch of people and you're going through resumes and all That.

178
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:04,819
Rym: there are not that many qualified people out there.

179
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,329
Rym: No, even now like even with all these stories of layoffs.

180
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:14,960
Scott: I did not see resumes that look good Yeah, but all the you know, all the talented people are gonna get scooped up really quick.

181
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:22,680
Scott: So it's good news for companies that you know Didn't lose all their money and have to lay people off because they're gonna be able to hire awesome people and become more.

182
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:26,460
Rym: It's also good a time of bad Awesome people who are looking for change.

183
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:42,657
Rym: It is also good news for any of you who are still in college because as you may recall Me and Scott and everyone in the front row crew We were in college and high school pretty much through the dot-com boom and avoid and the bust and avoided All the bad effects of it and we got back on the job market.

184
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:43,300
Rym: pretty much, right?

185
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,120
Scott: Yeah, but if we had been a little earlier We would have gotten the mad money's in the dot-com boom and then we would have been smart and quit before we lost.

186
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,320
Rym: If we've been earlier, but not as earlier we would have been caught at the bottom.

187
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:55,762
Scott: Yeah that was remember.

188
00:12:55,943 --> 00:13:08,760
Rym: the only people who are at least to IT wise and CS wise who are really really really gonna be hurt by This are people who don't have really exceptional skills In which case now is your chance to work out open source and bulk up that resume.

189
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:13,815
Rym: Or people who get out of college right now in which case look at that masters.

190
00:13:14,156 --> 00:13:15,380
Rym: that masters might be a good idea.

191
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:25,656
Scott: The best advice I can give is the advice that was rightfully given by so many other people on to it and on other Podcasts and I you know, basically everyone's saying it but it bears repeating because born into wealth.

192
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:26,700
Scott: That's true.

193
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:37,167
Scott: But also when the economy is bad the only thing the best thing to invest in is to invest in yourself because everything you have is Going to lose its value.

194
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:40,420
Scott: your house your money and the bank is even gonna lose its value.

195
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:44,520
Scott: But your skills are the only thing of value that are that are limited and whatnot.

196
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:54,600
Scott: so you should invest in your skills improve them and and such and that is the way to Keep things going well when you know, everything else that you have is not worth anything.

197
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:03,375
Rym: I think that's what Warren Buffett was saying about the the stocks in the economy and generally pretty much said What everyone else is being greedy panic, but everyone else is panicking.

198
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:04,980
Rym: be greedy work on it.

199
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:10,520
Rym: It pretty much go against the trend and if you see a lot of people going in one direction go in the other direction.

200
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:13,125
Rym: of course That might just be completely wrong.

201
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:19,920
Scott: if there's a hurricane coming or I think that those people we Warren Buffett's not stupid You know, he's real smart and he's got a lot of monies and whatnot.

202
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:32,640
Scott: But I I think that some of the people maybe not Warren Buffett, but other people who write investment books and such I think that what they write in those books is like aha If everyone does what my book says then I'll do this and I'll get money.

203
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:33,164
Scott: I think that's.

204
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:42,223
Scott: their plan is Release the book the next day invest in this because people reading the book will invest in that and then I'll make it rich Because of this.

205
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:49,054
Rym: see the real problem is just that if you add up the opinions of all the experts They basically completely cancel themselves out with the economy.

206
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:57,905
Scott: I mean, but but Like, you know, there's there's five strong buys on this stock and zero Strong sells.

207
00:14:58,206 --> 00:14:58,929
Scott: it must be good.

208
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,280
Rym: Well, I can't talk about that.

209
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,498
Rym: Yeah, unless we make up a hypothetical stock exactly talk about this fake stock, you know what?

210
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,820
Rym: by fly samo flag Nico.

211
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:14,200
Rym: Anyway, I had a news that I was a lot more excited about and I became alive.

212
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,627
Scott: SCC's knocking at the door.

213
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:18,220
Scott: They say semi-flanged companies out of business.

214
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:21,222
Rym: I Actually did.

215
00:15:21,242 --> 00:15:22,025
Rym: there is paperwork.

216
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:24,172
Rym: I can buy stock but it's so copy.

217
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:25,557
Scott: Can't buy a semi-flange anymore.

218
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:28,640
Rym: Sam a flag box of Sam anyway.

219
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:37,929
Rym: So I was excited about this news until I read the article and I don't know if the article is just bad But it looked a lot less promising.

220
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,073
Rym: that I was odd.

221
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,060
Rym: I guess I was led to believe by slash dot.

222
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:46,704
Rym: Here's the slash dot fictional town Eureka to become a real Blah blah blah.

223
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:47,970
Rym: I'm gonna skip all the crap here.

224
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,140
Scott: Wait, there was a fictional town name Eureka.

225
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,815
Rym: Is that from some TV show that I read a Wikipedia page about it.

226
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:55,080
Rym: Scott Johnson's dad likes it.

227
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,350
Rym: I think really or Scott Johnson likes it.

228
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,479
Rym: I'm not sure but it was on at the shore a lot.

229
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:03,819
Rym: Anyway, I never saw it, you know, well, you didn't look at the glowing box.

230
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:06,293
Rym: Yeah, everyone else was looking at the glowing box.

231
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,406
Scott: My brain is not programmed.

232
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:14,550
Rym: University of Queensland in Australia Plans to build a multi-billion dollar brain city.

233
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:19,284
Scott: now wait brain palace brain palace Oh my god.

234
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:22,758
Rym: dedicated to science and research and the death.

235
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:25,729
Scott: for well Obviously I should live there because I am the most dangerous.

236
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:28,105
Rym: I Have an MD.

237
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,120
Rym: I may or may not be a doctor.

238
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:39,734
Rym: The city hoping to hold at least 10,000 people is looking to attract 4,500 of the brightest scientists from around the world to live and work there.

239
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,400
Scott: Well, I'm brightest scientist number 4,500 and one so I should definitely be living there.

240
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,871
Rym: Well, no, that means you're not going to be living there because there are 4,500 people better than.

241
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:51,190
Rym: but they said 10,000 people are gonna Live there total.

242
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:58,520
Rym: Yes 4,500 scientists and I imagine the rest are going to be and ran style grunt laborers.

243
00:16:59,343 --> 00:17:01,471
Scott: But I'm the most dangerous a nerd grunt labor.

244
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:08,900
Scott: I Don't think you have a gun that is both a machine gun and a hook shot.

245
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,009
Rym: I have a feeling that you're not going to be shrugging.

246
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:13,319
Rym: you're going to be shrugged upon if you move there.

247
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:16,122
Rym: Now.

248
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:23,534
Rym: now basically, you know reading this article and reading all the articles What I envision is kind of like what we talked about in Friday night party line.

249
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,440
Rym: They're making a giant monastery.

250
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,510
Rym: It's kind of like in Civ 4 where I build a city.

251
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,740
Scott: Was it really gonna be like cut off though?

252
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,448
Scott: I mean, it's just gonna be a city like any other.

253
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:32,111
Scott: leave visitors.

254
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,880
Rym: Well, it's in Australia.

255
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,668
Scott: Oh and the outback are like next to Sydney.

256
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,835
Rym: It's west of Brisbane in Queensland.

257
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:39,617
Scott: Isn't it Brisbane?

258
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:41,979
Rym: I Don't know.

259
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,200
Rym: alrighty, honestly I Realized kind of recently that I know a lot about New Zealand and almost nothing about Australia.

260
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:50,349
Scott: I know.

261
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,403
Scott: the thing is I know Like.

262
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:59,100
Scott: I can draw like a weak map of Oceania in little like a pencil like, you know That's mostly limited by my drawing skills.

263
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:03,143
Scott: But if you ask me where the city's go on that map I can tell you.

264
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:06,379
Scott: I could tell you maybe where Sydney is on the East Coast, right?

265
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,311
Rym: Maybe breathing a little selfish is on the other side.

266
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:11,380
Rym: I'm gonna keep saying Brisbane unless someone died.

267
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,300
Scott: I have no freaking clue.

268
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:16,920
Rym: I don't think it's Brisbane because Brisbane give me a map of Albion.

269
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,429
Scott: I can put London on there and I can put.

270
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:23,602
Scott: I can sort of tell you where Scotland is, but that's about it Really?

271
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:25,450
Scott: I don't know where the different parts.

272
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:26,354
Rym: It's not that hard.

273
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:27,700
Scott: I don't know which part is Wales.

274
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:28,924
Rym: It's not that hard.

275
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:30,348
Rym: Wales is kind of in the middle.

276
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:31,612
Rym: Scotland's on top because the.

277
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:32,093
Rym: I know.

278
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:33,658
Scott: Scotland's on top because the Romans.

279
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,852
Rym: the whole Top not just like a point on the top.

280
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:36,900
Rym: The whole top is Scotland.

281
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:40,451
Rym: Okay, because the Romans could never conquer it and as well.

282
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:44,300
Rym: now I'm not gonna make fun of the Scottish because we met that cool Scottish dude, it's at Pax.

283
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,051
Rym: Yeah, I was gonna make a joke about huh?

284
00:18:47,854 --> 00:18:49,240
Rym: I have this really about ducks.

285
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:50,747
Rym: No, I don't know how I could get there.

286
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:54,904
Rym: But Brisbane is spelled Brisbane Bane of brises.

287
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:59,000
Rym: I was gonna make a joke about Jews, but I said weak-ass Joe it is I couldn't quite get there.

288
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,980
Rym: Don't even bother but I had it anyway.

289
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:04,899
Rym: I'm real excited about the idea of this.

290
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:07,148
Rym: I like the idea of taking the sieve for thing.

291
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:12,913
Rym: if I got I build my city over in the corner and I name it Brain palace and I set it up with all scientists.

292
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:14,300
Scott: Oh, I gotta do that.

293
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:18,220
Rym: I have that currently because I read this news earlier today.

294
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,257
Rym: I played sieve for on the train right next to new Rome is brain palace.

295
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:23,576
Rym: Oh sweet.

296
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:32,528
Scott: Now sadly if you go to the article You should put it right next to Tokyo 3.

297
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:34,495
Rym: if you go to the article slash dot links to.

298
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:51,587
Rym: if the headline is Brisbane to build Center to attract 4,500 lead scientists the picture is Just like a horse in the wilderness by himself And the article Does not really have the details.

299
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:53,231
Rym: I was looking for that's.

300
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:55,095
Scott: that's a. that's a most dangerous horse.

301
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:55,877
Rym: I'm not.

302
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:58,070
Rym: I just Go to.

303
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:09,917
Rym: don't read the article But think about what I said and how exciting this is and then click on this link and just without reading any words Look at the article and see what kind of dissonance might appear in your brain.

304
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:10,880
Scott: Are you sure this is real?

305
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:14,717
Scott: And not like that other story from the Australian newspaper about like the zombie dogs.

306
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:15,320
Scott: That wasn't true.

307
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:21,740
Rym: Um, I point out that the Australian newspaper got that from a Russian newspaper that has run that story like five times.

308
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:31,220
Rym: That zombie dog story has been making the round since like the 80s With the same picture of the dog - it's the most dangerous dog.

309
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:40,670
Rym: So I don't have much more to say about this because if I if I talk about I feel like I should do a Monday show About brain palace because I like the idea.

310
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:43,219
Rym: I don't know if Australia is the place but maybe it is.

311
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:45,610
Rym: I'll tell you what Brisbane?

312
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:49,163
Rym: if you want me there I'll come.

313
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:54,495
Rym: if you'll let me live there for free and pursue my science on the condition that you get better internets.

314
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,495
Rym: I Imagine if they're building a town with 4,500 lead scientists, there's going to be a better internet.

315
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:02,599
Scott: most dangerous internet.

316
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:14,880
Scott: I'm done with the most dangerous things of the day.

317
00:21:15,462 --> 00:21:21,120
Rym: I got a real kick out of this and I thought oh I should do something clever and put something backwards in the show.

318
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,908
Rym: But now I decided not to.

319
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:25,300
Rym: maybe I'll put the whole show up backwards.

320
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:33,100
Scott: We could probably just run a filter reverse the whole show and put it up that you know Two separate episodes that are the same thing, but one's backwards.

321
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,440
Rym: Well, I could put it in the experimental feed, but I don't know if anyone would listen to it.

322
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:38,780
Rym: Maybe I give you a free t-shirt.

323
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,280
Scott: Then we just do like, you know some sort of Beatles kind of thing or you say something.

324
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:48,654
Rym: Yep, I used to know how to say my name backwards.

325
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:50,520
Rym: I practiced that a lot when I was a kid.

326
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:51,878
Scott: What's wrong with you?

327
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:54,374
Rym: This is before the internet.

328
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:55,883
Rym: remember the show We just did about.

329
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:57,369
Rym: before you had internet.

330
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,039
Rym: you would do things on a computer that were inconceivable.

331
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,246
Rym: today I had.

332
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,100
Rym: I got some audio software.

333
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:09,923
Rym: So I record stuff and I'd play it backwards and then I'd memorize saying it backwards and then I'd say it backwards Recorded.

334
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:12,879
Rym: flip that and listen to it played right from the backwards.

335
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,655
Rym: play College humor did that times a million.

336
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:17,238
Rym: and I?

337
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:24,380
Rym: Have never been more amused by watching someone sing the star-spangled back banner while un-eating marshmallows.

338
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:25,608
Scott: See, I've done that.

339
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:34,671
Scott: the bad scene the star-spangled back The backwards star-spangled banner for The reverse national anthem.

340
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:39,580
Scott: I have heard that one before in fact I think there was a YouTube of the entire thing going down.

341
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,955
Scott: But they do some other reverse things in this video like the Rubik's Cube and whatnot.

342
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:45,436
Scott: Yes.

343
00:22:45,737 --> 00:22:50,552
Rym: It's it's pretty quality But just the un-eating that was that really did it for me.

344
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:52,137
Rym: Yeah, plus it's just.

345
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:52,980
Rym: it's a clever video.

346
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:55,432
Rym: I really like it and you know what I'm gonna spoil it for you.

347
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:59,244
Rym: It's backwards Gasp, gasp.

348
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,152
Scott: All right, so check this out ready.

349
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:03,060
Rym: I'm checkin in Germany.

350
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:09,477
Rym: They got some traffic cameras, right and is this an archive of funny things caught on camera?

351
00:23:09,777 --> 00:23:18,652
Scott: No, okay, and There's a guy he's been repeatedly caught speeding On roads in Bavaria, right repeatedly.

352
00:23:18,692 --> 00:23:30,288
Scott: He's driving some Audi and he is driving fast Right, and he should probably get a ticket and you know, we always complain about cameras, you know, giving people tickets and whatnot Sort of for revenue and yeah,

353
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,020
Rym: but I've no I'll just real quick before anyone gets on our cases.

354
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:35,468
Rym: I have no problem with speed cameras.

355
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,498
Rym: I have a problem with artificially deflated speed limits.

356
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:50,440
Scott: Yes Anyway, so this dude first of all, I I don't know if I don't know if it's legal to drive a British car in Germany Probably but he's driving a British car in Germany.

357
00:23:50,500 --> 00:24:07,570
Scott: So as his British plates, right and it has the steering wheel on The right-hand side of the car and the passenger seat is on the left-hand side All right, the German speed cameras only get your face if you're on Left side of the car.

358
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:18,420
Scott: Oh, so that's the first thing here is you have a guy who's speeding and getting away with it because they can't go after him unless they see who's driving even though They have the plates and they can look that shit up brilliant.

359
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:22,660
Scott: If they don't know who's driving they could have been someone else driving and they can't give him the ticket.

360
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,011
Scott: They got a fig, you know, so they can't, you know, actually mail him anything.

361
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:27,536
Scott: So there you go.

362
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:29,645
Scott: That's that's the beginning Part of it.

363
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:32,460
Rym: is this really involve the police doing something clever to get the dude?

364
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:35,212
Scott: No, it involves the dude doing something even more clever.

365
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:37,160
Rym: dummy picture of the Prime Minister.

366
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,940
Rym: He basically I would have put a picture of the Prime Minister in the passenger seat.

367
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:48,000
Scott: It looks like he has a replica or perhaps an original of what looks to be animal the Muppet.

368
00:24:48,985 --> 00:24:50,160
Rym: And he put animal.

369
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:56,820
Scott: He puts animal in the passenger seat which would be the driver's seat in a German car or a US car.

370
00:24:57,402 --> 00:25:03,360
Scott: So all you see is this picture of this Audi with British plates and an animal is driving.

371
00:25:05,522 --> 00:25:07,859
Scott: I guess he drives real fast cuz he's an animal.

372
00:25:08,563 --> 00:25:11,300
Rym: I would have gone one step further and put a fake steering wheel in and everything.

373
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,728
Scott: Yeah It looks like he just sort of when he knows.

374
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:18,307
Scott: it seems like he knows who the camera is cuz he because they see they Multiple pictures.

375
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:20,658
Scott: so he must know that this is what's going on.

376
00:25:21,161 --> 00:25:22,710
Rym: Well, you know, it's kind of like when I was a kid.

377
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,828
Rym: I go to Cedar Point and I'm you know Every time there's a roller coaster.

378
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:27,660
Rym: There's always the down at the bottom.

379
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:34,400
Rym: You can see the picture of you and your friends screaming or getting you know Whatever and they always put it at some spot along the way when I was really young.

380
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:40,852
Rym: My dad just took me aside and he said alright son I want you to memorize where all the cameras are and I said why.

381
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:45,520
Rym: dad and he said watch and learn and that was when he brought out the laminated newspaper.

382
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,797
Scott: See I usually don't like to read the article, you know when I know we do a news or thing today But I got to read at least this little bit ready all right.

383
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:58,775
Scott: Now police have released one of the photographs in the hope so and recognize the furry speed demon.

384
00:25:58,795 --> 00:26:01,740
Scott: a German police source said The number plate is not enough.

385
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,680
Scott: We need a clear evidence of who is driving the vehicle - but because this is a British vehicle We can never get a decent picture.

386
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:11,920
Scott: The driver has obviously worked this out because he has placed a large puppet in the passenger seat.

387
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:18,192
Scott: This may be an example of the famous British sense of humor, but it is still dangerous driving (Laughter).

388
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:20,764
Rym: This guy gets props.

389
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:24,696
Scott: We suspect he positions the toy deliberately before accelerating past the camera.

390
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:25,800
Rym: Thank you Rick Romero.

391
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:34,200
Rym: So Today was a breath of fresh air the likes of which I have not had in a very long time.

392
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:44,234
Rym: You see I was able to SSH to my computer by not typing an IP address that I have to guess But by typing tochiro.house.

393
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:48,434
Rym: Oh my gosh We have a freaking DNS server again.

394
00:26:48,555 --> 00:26:49,520
Rym: Thank the gods.

395
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:54,136
Scott: It's so because the other one died and then my parents.

396
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:55,280
Scott: so I bought them a laptop.

397
00:26:55,421 --> 00:26:57,720
Scott: So I took their old desktop, but it was eating hard drives.

398
00:26:57,861 --> 00:27:00,800
Scott: But I got a hard drive that works in it, and it's booted up and seems to be good.

399
00:27:00,881 --> 00:27:02,312
Scott: And we have DNS.

400
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,220
Scott: It's it's glorious.

401
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:09,765
Scott: I think I can print without having to like figure out the IP address of the Mac every single time I want to.

402
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:16,760
Rym: I'd always forget the whatever command It was to print because we have the printer set up in a way that I don't use anywhere outside of this house.

403
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,720
Scott: I've got it now so you can set it up real easy.

404
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:29,060
Rym: Oh good, because I I would always set it up and then like a month later I'd have to print something but the IP address had changed And I would always forget what I did and I couldn't print and then I just give up.

405
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,040
Rym: I'd like go down to the Mac and print from there.

406
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,408
Scott: I see most people don't realize this right most people.

407
00:27:33,448 --> 00:27:37,000
Scott: you have a home network and your computers get IP addresses from the router.

408
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:44,180
Scott: Right if you have more than one and so every computer has some IP address They're all different and you might have a different one today and a different one tomorrow.

409
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,888
Scott: But you don't care right any networking stuff.

410
00:27:46,928 --> 00:27:48,634
Scott: you do it within the house.

411
00:27:48,914 --> 00:28:09,039
Scott: you might do some windows file sharing You might do some iTunes music sharing But that stuff doesn't require that you actually know the IP of the other computer on the network because it just sort of uses Broadcast and Bonjour and things like that that allow computers to just discover any other computer on the network regardless of IP address.

412
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:21,864
Scott: But if you want to do something like you know have a real file server or Share a printer or you know without Samba you know or something like that you need to know or SSH Or play some games.

413
00:28:22,085 --> 00:28:26,357
Scott: you got to know the IP address of the other machines on your local network.

414
00:28:26,577 --> 00:28:33,020
Rym: now the thing is I Realized that a lot of people don't bother with this sort of thing and most people don't have to bother with this.

415
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,424
Rym: But I remember that thread where you know people are saying What do you name your computers?

416
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:40,076
Rym: and more than one person said why would I name my computer something?

417
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:41,360
Rym: It's Kate's computer.

418
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,170
Rym: It's Adams laptop.

419
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:43,654
Rym: That's it.

420
00:28:43,694 --> 00:28:44,420
Rym: That's all we do.

421
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:51,460
Scott: What if I'm using you know what if there's ten computers in my house, and I want to connect from the computer I'm using to Scott's computer?

422
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:53,952
Scott: I don't want to have to go and do an end map.

423
00:28:54,173 --> 00:29:00,734
Scott: figure out that Scott's computer Which has an IP address of 101 at this moment in time and then ping 192 168 1 1 0 1.

424
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:07,365
Scott: I want to just say Connect to Scott's computer and type in Scott's Computer and have it connect.

425
00:29:07,505 --> 00:29:10,559
Scott: and that is what having a DNS server in your house allows you to do.

426
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:18,340
Rym: But when we first moved into this house it actually We had a little trouble from the start because this house was lived in by nuns before us.

427
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:22,659
Scott: None before no nuns and their nunnery made DNS not work.

428
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:30,038
Rym: Well, no what their nunnery did was the house was set up for people who are not geeks like us as in.

429
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:34,459
Rym: they must have TV and you know the landlord probably too because normal people would live here.

430
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:53,180
Rym: So cable comes into the side of the house And then it splits into the two apartments and then in our house it splits into like four jacks all over the place and When he had the cable guy first come out he was doing tone tests And he basically told us that the wiring inside of our house the coax cables are barely wires.

431
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:57,859
Rym: Wow like the amount like the amount of signal loss was staggering is what he said.

432
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,616
Rym: So we had a little bit of trouble getting internet even when we first moved in.

433
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:14,050
Rym: and then I remember later We even had a problem where the wire outside the house stopped working and they replaced the entire local loop outside from the from the Pole outside all the way to our house to the switch box.

434
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,354
Scott: and then it still didn't work.

435
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:17,682
Scott: and eventually the answer was our cable Modem was broken.

436
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:19,809
Rym: well the answer was our cable modem was weak.

437
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:24,807
Rym: our cable was also weak between the two disaster Our cable is still weak.

438
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,637
Rym: the cable modem now is strong.

439
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,829
Scott: Yes Yes, everything is okay now.

440
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:31,021
Rym: Yeah, but you know being geeks We did.

441
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:35,342
Rym: we couldn't wire the house properly because we don't own this house We rent it.

442
00:30:35,382 --> 00:30:39,940
Rym: so I couldn't do what I want to do which was install actual nice jacks into the walls.

443
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:46,239
Scott: Yeah, that look all fancy and not have wires running around on the floor, but the wires in the walls where they belong.

444
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,720
Rym: I remember I thought about to have some sort of patch panel in the basement.

445
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:53,068
Rym: So I remember we first moved in.

446
00:30:53,108 --> 00:31:02,563
Rym: I popped off the coax jack to see what was in the wall And I saw things I didn't want to see and I just put that jack back on and decided that nothing was ever going Through those walls.

447
00:31:02,663 --> 00:31:03,345
Rym: Oh my god.

448
00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:05,973
Rym: I wouldn't have even been able to get a snake through there.

449
00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:07,959
Scott: Well not even like.

450
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:14,930
Rym: Well, I guess I could have put a garter snake in the wall.

451
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:19,250
Scott: Oh, what if you tied some cat5 to its tail and it would it would have you know made its way where it's got to go.

452
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:27,454
Rym: Yeah, so now I'm gonna have cat5 outside Hey Good or maybe into the apartment downstairs Oh, it's good to.

453
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:31,330
Rym: maybe maybe into the bathroom through the toilet down into the sewer.

454
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:35,653
Scott: You know, maybe if we attach some cat5 to some migratory birds We could.

455
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:40,750
Scott: it'd be real cheap to get some connections down to Florida perhaps Australia where they have slow internets.

456
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,425
Rym: So we you know, basically what we did.

457
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:45,569
Scott: I'm sorry migratory is.

458
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:48,429
Rym: I believe it's migratory.

459
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:52,610
Rym: Oh Using coconut, okay.

460
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:57,050
Rym: So I like how I didn't even make a relevant Monty Python quote.

461
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:02,590
Rym: I did whatever high school kid does was someone says something that could be a Monty Python joke.

462
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:08,170
Rym: They make an unrelated Monty Python quote simply to note that they could have made a Monty Python quote.

463
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:12,203
Rym: Anyway, me also lame people in college continue to do that.

464
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:14,190
Rym: That's how you tell lame people in college.

465
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:16,149
Rym: but what we did?

466
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:23,743
Rym: As we had the guy install the cable modem downstairs because he wouldn't do it anywhere else He said the signal was all bad and then he left.

467
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:27,998
Rym: and then we took it upstairs To my room and we realized that that wasn't gonna work.

468
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:38,826
Rym: So we actually pulled cable across Into the hallway between the two bedrooms, but the cable modem there bought a switch put the switch.

469
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:40,130
Rym: there bought a router.

470
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,397
Scott: We put the switch way later.

471
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,349
Rym: Actually, I think well we had the for using.

472
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,042
Scott: Yeah, we're using the four port switch right and then we got the.

473
00:32:46,223 --> 00:32:47,630
Scott: so it's six port later seven.

474
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:48,741
Rym: Yeah, but we had the router.

475
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:52,070
Scott: we put it there, you know But I think it's a but one of them has to be used for the uplink.

476
00:32:52,572 --> 00:32:54,319
Rym: so we ran a cable to school.

477
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,172
Rym: we ran a cable to Scott's room and a cable to my room and That was it.

478
00:32:58,534 --> 00:33:00,081
Rym: and that did not serve our purposes.

479
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:00,563
Rym: We're geeks.

480
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,989
Rym: We have a lot more than two computers.

481
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,956
Scott: We got computers downstairs.

482
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:07,830
Scott: You got wireless computers all over the place, but you know, we had the wireless going on.

483
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:11,950
Rym: Yeah, so we had a computer connected downstairs and we wanted to watch.

484
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:14,600
Rym: It was that old Ubuntu computer that didn't even work.

485
00:33:15,183 --> 00:33:17,070
Scott: it worked for a while barely.

486
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:20,389
Scott: It just didn't serve the TV purposes that well because it was hard to.

487
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:23,502
Scott: you know Cuz the desktop interface is not so good as a TV.

488
00:33:23,582 --> 00:33:23,763
Rym: Wow.

489
00:33:23,783 --> 00:33:25,389
Rym: Yeah, that was back before I bought the Mac.

490
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:30,430
Scott: Yeah, we were emulating on the TV and such, you know It's only because we got rid of that that we got to do virtual castle.

491
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,323
Rym: But the tea it didn't have internet downstairs and we couldn't.

492
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:34,690
Rym: we were trying to figure out what to do.

493
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:39,090
Rym: I couldn't run a cable properly because I couldn't do it through the wall, you know rental house.

494
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:42,190
Rym: So we thought we could buy a wireless card for downstairs.

495
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:45,870
Rym: Wireless cards were way more money than we were willing to spend back then.

496
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:50,904
Rym: Oh, yeah, and also not fast enough for streaming real-time, you know movies and such.

497
00:33:51,165 --> 00:33:58,367
Scott: also PCI wireless cards You know, they're not really, you know, they're not that compatible even with you know, Windows computers.

498
00:33:58,527 --> 00:33:59,996
Scott: They're not trustworthy I don't.

499
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:01,270
Scott: I don't like them at all.

500
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:15,130
Rym: Yeah And we thought about buying like a wireless bridge and those are even more Screw that shit and then I realized kind of randomly that there's a hole in The edge of like the stairway that can go down into the storage closet downstairs.

501
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:19,342
Rym: So basically by hooker crook, I ran a network cable.

502
00:34:19,444 --> 00:34:21,370
Rym: It goes across the floor at only two points.

503
00:34:22,154 --> 00:34:31,770
Rym: So we have to have this never cable like taped to the floor Across the hallway between the bedrooms and then it goes under the carpet all the way across to this hole Where it goes into a closet.

504
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,549
Rym: I have a service loop in there.

505
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:40,009
Rym: Then it goes across the hallway downstairs again tape and then I run it like behind and under the carpet again to the TV.

506
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:42,981
Scott: So finally enough we never trip over that one.

507
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:44,530
Scott: We only trip over the one in my room.

508
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:48,246
Rym: Yeah, well because the one in your room is not which is the closest to the cable.

509
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:53,550
Rym: Yeah, but really, you know being geeks this wasn't enough because the router kind of sucks.

510
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,103
Rym: We had that four port switch, but that also wasn't enough.

511
00:34:57,143 --> 00:34:58,930
Rym: So we bought an eight port switch.

512
00:34:59,431 --> 00:34:59,913
Rym: We plug that.

513
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:04,347
Rym: basically our network infrastructure is thus cable modem goes to router.

514
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:04,648
Rym: router.

515
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:08,143
Scott: It's a linksys router, you know with the wireless and whatnot.

516
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:11,356
Rym: router has one cable in it Which goes to eight port switch.

517
00:35:11,897 --> 00:35:13,242
Rym: two ports go to Scott's room.

518
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:14,566
Rym: three ports go to my room.

519
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:15,750
Scott: all three go to your room.

520
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,482
Scott: What are you doing?

521
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:16,909
Rym: IP phone?

522
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:23,326
Rym: All of these are in use and in fact It's a problem because I have a fourth computer in my room and know where to plug it in.

523
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:24,210
Rym: It's using the wireless.

524
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:25,114
Scott: Wireless is fine.

525
00:35:25,134 --> 00:35:28,350
Scott: Yeah, actually use my laptop on a wire in my room.

526
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,054
Scott: I just use the.

527
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,990
Rym: I do because I do a lot of large file transfers.

528
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:42,650
Rym: Yeah, I guess yeah, and then we have one cable going downstairs But then terminated on that cable is the old four port switch because the Roku and the computer are plugged into that.

529
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,323
Scott: Yeah, the Wii uses the wireless but the we could use the wired if I wanted to do.

530
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:50,710
Rym: the only reason I haven't hooked it Up to the wired is that we need to buy that adapt.

531
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:55,084
Rym: No, no, no, but we internet sucks and I don't need to lower the latency because there's nothing.

532
00:35:55,124 --> 00:36:00,702
Scott: this is no use at all Other than downloading virtual console games, but I'm never in a hurry.

533
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,665
Rym: So it doesn't matter.

534
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:02,067
Scott: Yeah.

535
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:10,250
Rym: Yeah, it's good Yeah, but you know basically the trick to having a geek house is to not use any of the functionality of your linksys router.

536
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:14,810
Scott: Well, I mean the thing is a linksys router, you know, what it does is enough for most people, right?

537
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,950
Scott: But the problem with it is is that it's not a hundred percent flexible, right?

538
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:29,290
Scott: For example, if you know a linksys router is really just a Linux computer that has a wireless You know antenna in it and you know a bunch of network cards.

539
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:40,190
Scott: it's really all it is is a really, you know, weak computer that has these connections on it and You could do everything it does with an actual computer and it would be faster and you could have a lot more flexibility.

540
00:36:40,772 --> 00:36:44,688
Scott: but you have to have a whole computer as opposed to a tiny little cheap box.

541
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:48,009
Scott: and Some of the things that the router does are you know?

542
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:57,779
Scott: Actually, what it does is fine for most people for super super nerds even more nerdier than us nothing It does is good enough and yeah, you can't even use it.

543
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,090
Rym: sadly even the switch we have is not really I mean one.

544
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:11,983
Rym: it's not giggy which isn't a big deal for the internet because I don't need my giggy going to my cable modem, but File transfers in the house could be faster because every modern computer has giggy.

545
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:14,350
Rym: In fact, my computer has two just on the motherboard.

546
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:17,279
Rym: Yeah, most computers do most motherboards do so.

547
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:23,910
Scott: so what we do in the house is we we don't do we don't take all the Abilities that we don't all take all the work away from the router.

548
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:33,770
Scott: We let the router still do the NAT right the the network address translation Because that's sort of a pain and the router does it nicely and it just works so it can keep going.

549
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,797
Scott: We let it do the wireless.

550
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:36,530
Scott: We don't let it do anything else.

551
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,430
Scott: We don't let it do DHCP and we don't let it do DNS because it can't do DNS anyway.

552
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:54,590
Scott: We actually set up another computer to do DHCP and DNS and the benefit of that is that because we have a computer that does DHCP Every machine on the network will always get the same IP address.

553
00:37:54,811 --> 00:38:03,625
Scott: So if I was just using the router and I connect my start my computer Maybe now that means it gets IP address 101, but then I restart it now.

554
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:05,611
Scott: It's got IP address 110.

555
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:10,066
Scott: Oh, it just the router just picks up at random in whatever range you set.

556
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:14,785
Scott: if I have a DHCP Server I can say this MAC address is this IP address.

557
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:15,830
Rym: It is a Monday show.

558
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:27,568
Scott: I don't know if we need to explain what DHCP and DNS do no, but the point is is that the benefit is You don't you know have to freaking guess all the time what freaking IP addresses all the computers are.

559
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:29,026
Rym: you just know It's all good.

560
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:35,409
Rym: but the other problem we're running into is that most people seem like people know switches are better, but they don't really know why.

561
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:42,835
Rym: and The Linksys switch we have has eight ports but it only has like a 200 megabit backplane.

562
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:55,565
Rym: meaning if I'm using my full connection to like the server and Scott is using his full connection to like the Mac downstairs We're already maxing out the switch and we're gonna start losing like things are gonna slow down for everyone.

563
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,549
Rym: and it's not that great because We actually have a lot of data going on

564
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:09,710
Scott: Even though even though the network is you know 100 megabit per second or you know It's it's 100 as opposed to you know gig you can't actually get the full 100 on every port at the same time.

565
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,530
Scott: You can only get it on like two or three of the ports at the same time.

566
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:23,656
Rym: But I want to talk about the fantasy because the only reason we haven't made the net basically the network has been this kind of cobbled together thing in this house mostly because we don't own the house and Of course lately.

567
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:25,990
Rym: I've been putting off way too many things until I own a house.

568
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:31,890
Rym: It's gotten to the point where I look at my closet and it's a mess and I think I can fix that by moving.

569
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:34,341
Scott: Yeah, that's a bad situation.

570
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:42,180
Rym: Yeah, I look at the pile of Leases and over until like the spring Like like more and more like I don't have enough shelves for all.

571
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:50,510
Rym: my books need to look over to like the wine fridge And next to the wine fridge are like 20 books just in a pile and there's another pile of growing next to it.

572
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:52,137
Rym: And I keep thinking yeah.

573
00:39:52,177 --> 00:39:54,508
Rym: Well, I'll put them on the shelf in the house when I buy it.

574
00:39:56,692 --> 00:39:57,781
Rym: But we've both been doing that.

575
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:01,750
Rym: about the network, I mean Ideally, I want a real router.

576
00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:03,595
Scott: Yeah, not some little links.

577
00:40:03,615 --> 00:40:05,160
Scott: this guy like a real one.

578
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:08,170
Scott: you rack mounted router with an expensive interface car.

579
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:12,563
Rym: I want because my idea is that I want to actually set up proper networking is in.

580
00:40:12,884 --> 00:40:24,425
Rym: I want to have the kind of External facing network because the plan is I want to put a computer there and use one of those Dynamic DNS things to let our cable modem have a static name out.

581
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:25,710
Scott: You actually have a DMZ.

582
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:29,469
Scott: I mean the router we have can do DMZ but not really it's pretty weak.

583
00:40:30,113 --> 00:40:33,469
Scott: Actually have a DMZ or maybe you can run some NS servers or whatnot.

584
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:37,990
Rym: Yeah Well, I want to do that and I also just want to have this external facing server for any time.

585
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:40,321
Rym: I just need to like give someone a big file.

586
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:42,310
Rym: I can say yeah FTP to here just throw up a dumb.

587
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:46,187
Scott: Also, you should pay the extra money to get a static IP for the ISP.

588
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:51,610
Rym: Yeah I mean eventually we'll get files somewhere and then I'll just like I'm waiting for that day.

589
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:52,554
Scott: Maybe we should.

590
00:40:52,594 --> 00:40:55,730
Scott: only you should tell the real estate lady only houses with five hooks.

591
00:40:56,071 --> 00:41:10,029
Rym: But more importantly I want a real switch because I want to have a fully segregated separate internal network so I can have a really insecure everything's open internal network for like Landgaming and file-sharing and all that stuff.

592
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:22,210
Rym: But yet I want to have this kind of protected zone that like say people who come over and have their wireless laptop They can get on the internet, but they can't access any of our internal network and bring their windows worms with them.

593
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:23,135
Scott: No, that's true.

594
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:33,950
Rym: That's true and all that sort of stuff and I want to have kind of the File transfer gigabit separate vlan so that all the internal stuff has its own network mostly so I can have the full speed.

595
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,590
Rym: They're completely independent of the outside speed and the outside network.

596
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:45,110
Scott: And yeah that way when we're doing like, you know watch a video on this computer, but the videos on the other computer You know it actually you don't have to worry about it slow.

597
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,450
Scott: I mean right now it's actually pretty fast, but that's because no one else is doing anything at the same time.

598
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:58,130
Rym: Yeah I also really want to set up VPN access to our network from the outside in a legitimate and non hackish non shady website way.

599
00:41:58,371 --> 00:41:59,896
Scott: Yeah, that would be actually like.

600
00:42:00,177 --> 00:42:08,626
Scott: the biggest thing that would you know actually I would use all the time would be you know Get to my home computer no matter where I am and without having to do some sort of shady crap.

601
00:42:08,747 --> 00:42:11,557
Scott: That's untrustworthy Because you know, I'm at work.

602
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:12,683
Scott: I want to listen to some music.

603
00:42:12,723 --> 00:42:13,568
Scott: It's on my hard drive.

604
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:19,127
Scott: at home I got to use like simplify media or something like that and it's it's okay, but it's not.

605
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:19,870
Scott: it's not great.

606
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:24,527
Scott: You know if I could actually connect to my network at home for real, but other people couldn't.

607
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:25,290
Scott: oh, that'd be sweet.

608
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:28,585
Rym: Yeah, I also kind of want to have if I get a good access point.

609
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:29,770
Rym: I want to have two wireless networks.

610
00:42:29,951 --> 00:42:33,044
Rym: I want to have the kind of our private one like the front row crew.

611
00:42:33,145 --> 00:42:42,270
Rym: actually all of us We use the same SS ID and the same everything so anyone visits anyone's house We all are just online automatically because everyone has laptops.

612
00:42:42,431 --> 00:42:49,098
Rym: But I like the idea of having the kind of private wireless that's super secure You know WPA and then be completely open.

613
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:52,587
Rym: open public wireless that anyone on the street can connect to.

614
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:59,808
Rym: because one if People on the street can connect they can get online and check their email And I can snoop and mess with them if I want to.

615
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:00,150
Rym: and all that.

616
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:10,226
Scott: We should set up a thing that just automatically like, you know, it takes all traffic on the you know That network and then friggin run strings on it stars all the good stuff.

617
00:43:10,306 --> 00:43:17,656
Rym: and more importantly though I just I like the idea of providing that service because you know how many times you're out there somewhere and Man, if only I could get online.

618
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:24,540
Rym: Oh snap wireless network and I kind of want to provide that to people but I don't do that now Because I don't trust people.

619
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,445
Rym: I want to have an untrusted Wireless that I can just pipe to the internet and block from everything else.

620
00:43:30,047 --> 00:43:38,579
Scott: Mm-hmm We could also have the untrusted week, you know, we could do evil stuff like with that untrusted wireless Just like no matter what URL they go to it goes to for occur.com.

621
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:38,920
Scott: Yeah.

622
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:42,492
Rym: Well, we could also remember though saying this I will.

623
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:51,801
Rym: I'm not saying this as an advocation and I'm not saying that we are going to do this but Supposing that you have an unsecured wireless access point in your house.

624
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:57,950
Rym: You have basically provided yourself with undeniable plausible deniability.

625
00:43:58,831 --> 00:43:59,875
Scott: Also, it's a nice honey pot.

626
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,324
Rym: Yes, and honey pots are fun.

627
00:44:02,404 --> 00:44:03,770
Scott: Maybe I'd run an actual honey pot.

628
00:44:05,051 --> 00:44:05,694
Rym: Yeah, we could.

629
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:10,010
Rym: I kind of like that old XK CD where he has all those VMS and he collects worms.

630
00:44:10,653 --> 00:44:12,399
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

631
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:15,010
Rym: This is kind of a crowd people show and I ran out of steam.

632
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:21,410
Scott: Yeah, I don't think there's much more to say but mostly because someone today was like, why do you need DNS in your house?

633
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,131
Scott: it's well.

634
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:31,970
Scott: the two reasons are as we said now we can actually connect to computers in our house by typing in the name and Because you know, most people just use their ISPs DNS server, which is pretty fast.

635
00:44:32,472 --> 00:44:37,170
Scott: It's a tiny bit faster if your local DNS, you know, you have a local DNS cache.

636
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,706
Rym: Well, it's also a lot better because our local DNS server.

637
00:44:40,726 --> 00:44:41,530
Rym: I got to set it up more.

638
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:48,430
Rym: I mean Scott did the basic setup But when we set it up originally what I did is I used the three DNS servers that I know our ISP has.

639
00:44:49,112 --> 00:44:58,343
Rym: I also added my favorite secret DNS server from our IT that I still use to this day when I need a quick DNS And a couple other DNS servers that I trust out on the internet.

640
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,030
Scott: I think it's only two or three in there now.

641
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:06,830
Rym: yeah, we used to have a whole bunch and It basically provides because a lot of times people have a problem where their ISP will be fine.

642
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,959
Rym: But the ISP is DNS stop working.

643
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:11,028
Scott: Mmm, very true.

644
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:16,778
Rym: Very true I also have to set up the NTP, which I actually know a lot about now And I'm gonna set up like the most.

645
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,513
Rym: I can basically give us the same NTP.

646
00:45:19,914 --> 00:45:23,125
Scott: all I want to be able to do is have my computer get the correct time.

647
00:45:23,426 --> 00:45:24,028
Rym: I can do that.

648
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:30,004
Scott: It shall be done without having to ask Microsoft or the government for it.

649
00:45:30,104 --> 00:45:30,325
Scott: Yes.

650
00:45:30,365 --> 00:45:31,670
Rym: Well, we're going to ask the government?

651
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:38,061
Scott: Well, yeah, but I mean, I don't want my desktop to ask the government I just want the server to ask the government every other as this.

652
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:39,367
Rym: there are two ways to go about this.

653
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:49,832
Rym: I can either Ask the government and it's not illegal to in fact They encourage people to but at the same time it is taking advantage of a public boon when I don't have to take advantage Of it.

654
00:45:50,396 --> 00:46:00,713
Rym: I can give us fucking accurate time Mm-hmm and redistribute it inside our own internal network or we can just use the NTP pool, which is fine is okay It's good enough.

655
00:46:01,336 --> 00:46:06,510
Rym: We will get an order of magnitude better time But yeah an order of magnitude better.

656
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:11,710
Scott: So instead of being accurate to the thousandth of a second will be accurate to the billionth of a second.

657
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,118
Rym: Well, no, we won't will be accurate.

658
00:46:13,138 --> 00:46:20,730
Rym: Well, if it remember there's the Accuracy and the precision we will have a percent will have a precision that is pretty good.

659
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:27,348
Rym: You know 20 to 40 milliseconds, but we'll have an accuracy to within like a thousand ten thousandth of a second most likely.

660
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:27,869
Scott: Mm-hmm.

661
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:29,042
Rym: Hey, whatever.

662
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:29,489
Rym: We're done.

663
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:38,601
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
