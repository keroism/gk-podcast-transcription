00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,486
Rym: It's Tuesday October 1st, 2013.

2
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:11,509
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:12,932
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,416
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:15,058
Rym: We're back.

6
00:00:15,178 --> 00:00:15,840
Rym: We're bad.

7
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:19,013
Rym: It's time for a gaming news roundup.

8
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:20,539
Scott: We did not get shut down.

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,058
Scott: Let's do this.

10
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:27,955
Rym: Yeah, so we were at PAX.

11
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:30,122
Scott: That was a long-ass time ago already.

12
00:00:30,202 --> 00:00:37,083
Rym: And we were at that other PAX and one thing led to another And basically I got sent to Istanbul and I just got back.

13
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:40,273
Rym: So we missed a bunch of extra GeekNights We didn't expect to miss.

14
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,220
Scott: But we should be good until Magfest.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,681
Rym: Magfest?

16
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:44,564
Rym: Not yet.

17
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:45,085
Rym: Not yet.

18
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:49,135
Scott: So regular GeekNights Regular GeekNights for a few months.

19
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,130
Rym: We also have a brand new mixer that I'm still working on and tweaking.

20
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:59,280
Rym: I'm very proud of the fact that we no longer Most of you will not know or care what I'm talking about.

21
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:05,029
Rym: We have had a Samsung compressor Between us and the internet for many many years.

22
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,377
Rym: We no longer need that.

23
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:14,581
Rym: I have enough bit depth to record the fullness of our volume Raw and then do everything in post.

24
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:16,590
Scott: So why don't we just sell that and give us money?

25
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:20,700
Rym: That compressor now is worth maybe 80 bucks.

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,563
Scott: Sweet, money.

27
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:22,927
Rym: Besides, actually.

28
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:23,710
Scott: Give me the 80 bucks.

29
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,415
Rym: You know when we're gonna use this thing?

30
00:01:26,198 --> 00:01:32,210
Rym: If we're doing live video kinds of things or streaming Where we can't wait to do it in post.

31
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:33,814
Scott: So true.

32
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:36,325
Rym: Yeah, there are situations where we'll still need this thing.

33
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:37,410
Scott: But that is not a digital compressor.

34
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,344
Scott: So we can't use this mixer with it, can't we?

35
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:40,029
Rym: Oh, yeah, you can.

36
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:42,918
Scott: You just put it before the mixer.

37
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,524
Rym: No, you don't put it before the mixer.

38
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:45,728
Rym: You put it in the mixer.

39
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:48,896
Rym: Oh It's called a channel insert.

40
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:50,561
Rym: I have a special cable.

41
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:52,728
Rym: Actually, the cables are dangling down right here.

42
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:53,992
Rym: I'm holding it now I see.

43
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:54,754
Scott: I see what you do.

44
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:57,161
Rym: If you plug that into the back, it's TRS.

45
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,210
Scott: Does that go before or after you preamp in the mixer?

46
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:04,062
Rym: It goes after preamp, but before fader.

47
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:06,610
Rym: So before this fader and before this equalization.

48
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,179
Rym: But what I'm recording here is also before this.

49
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,906
Rym: Look, I can turn on volume all the way down.

50
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:12,391
Rym: It still records just fine Whoa.

51
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:13,736
Rym: Because we're recording raw.

52
00:02:13,756 --> 00:02:14,961
Rym: Check that shit out.

53
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:17,430
Rym: But this would cut off the Elgato stream.

54
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:27,630
Rym: Okay, basically I'm nerding out because for many years We used an analog mixer that connected to, for a while, a USB device and then a firewire device.

55
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:30,330
Rym: But now I have a fully digital workflow.

56
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,614
Rym: Good fucking God.

57
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:34,740
Rym: I should have spent this money a long time ago.

58
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,067
Rym: It was worth every red cent.

59
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:38,190
Rym: So stay tuned.

60
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,573
Rym: We'll ferment a moment where we'll talk about all the new streaming kind of stuff We're gonna start doing.

61
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:44,520
Scott: So I just have an opening bit.

62
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:46,086
Scott: I just want to say something real quick.

63
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:47,310
Rym: Something quick?

64
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,460
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, I'm wearing this Google Glass trying to see if I can make some use of it Right, and of course people come up and ask me about it.

65
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,570
Rym: Well, they always ask you the same thing, too.

66
00:02:57,815 --> 00:02:59,303
Scott: They ask how is it and how is?

67
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:06,378
Scott: it is slightly an annoying question But not too annoying because I guess it sort of is a question I just don't know what to say.

68
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,589
Rym: Say you were eating a sandwich and I was like, how is it?

69
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,033
Scott: It's a sandwich.

70
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:11,098
Rym: But what about it?

71
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:12,325
Rym: Like you're eating a DiBella sub.

72
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,310
Scott: What about it?

73
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,718
Scott: Do you want- this is such a generic question, right?

74
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,042
Scott: I needed something more specific.

75
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:19,390
Scott: Like does that say how does the sandwich taste?

76
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,716
Scott: I'd be like, oh, it tastes great.

77
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:21,439
Rym: But how is?

78
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,734
Rym: it is a question of the overall Disposition of the sandwich.

79
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:26,557
Rym: Right, but how is it?

80
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:27,199
Rym: Pretty good.

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,942
Rym: How is it?

82
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:28,825
Rym: Kind of shitty.

83
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,290
Scott: Yeah, it is what it is.

84
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:39,072
Scott: Anyway, what bothers me even more is this question suddenly that the how is it's have been disappearing and being replaced with an even dumber Question.

85
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:40,737
Rym: How could it be a dumber question?

86
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:43,286
Scott: The question is and I've got this twice today.

87
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,550
Scott: That was just today.

88
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,886
Rym: I'm guessing this is gonna be something surprisingly and weirdly wrong and specific not just like what is that?

89
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:52,949
Scott: The question is is that Google Glass?

90
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,309
Scott: So wait, you know what Google Glass is.

91
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,929
Rym: That's what I was about to say if I would excuse someone who didn't know what it was.

92
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:05,760
Scott: But if they've heard of it, you've heard of it that you know the name of it And you say is that what that is?

93
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:06,965
Rym: Is this Homestuck?

94
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:08,150
Scott: Is that Homestuck?

95
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,888
Scott: it's like if I was walking down the street holding an ice cream and you'd be like is that ice cream?

96
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:20,601
Scott: and So basically my first I was like, I'm gonna give the sarcastic answer like no It's just something I made on my own and people are like they.

97
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,233
Scott: I guess their sarcasm detector wasn't working Scott.

98
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:25,410
Scott: I sound sarcastic just now Scott.

99
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:30,945
Rym: When it comes to technology people really don't know right?

100
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:36,303
Rym: So if you're like, yes I made this and they think you're a nerd they will assume that you did.

101
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:38,470
Scott: in fact even in my sarcastic tone of voice.

102
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:40,577
Rym: Also, you always kind of sound like that.

103
00:04:40,597 --> 00:04:42,283
Scott: I was but I was sad a super second.

104
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:44,070
Rym: Anyway, there's super super sarcastic.

105
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:48,035
Rym: Yes, I made this myself Okay.

106
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:54,909
Rym: Anyway, so This huge this hugely complicated tiny piece of precision machinery, that's it.

107
00:04:56,212 --> 00:05:00,930
Scott: Yeah, it's so my new response that I started working on is what else could it be?

108
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,756
Rym: That's pretty good.

109
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:05,259
Rym: I like that.

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,144
Rym: Yeah, that's good.

111
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:12,990
Scott: So They were like, oh And that basically made them realize they were dumb.

112
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:19,410
Scott: So if you want to if you see someone right and I you know, like for example, I met a listener at the Maker Faire.

113
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:22,805
Scott: He was a cool dude, right and he didn't really ask about the Google Glass.

114
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:23,388
Scott: I don't remember.

115
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:25,130
Rym: funnily enough I met a different list.

116
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:27,943
Scott: He didn't ask really dumb questions or anything.

117
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:29,148
Scott: He was totally cool guy, right?

118
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:35,248
Scott: You know, whatever, but he just didn't really say anything like you just like hey, uh, nice to meet you.

119
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:35,970
Scott: You're Scott, right?

120
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,895
Rym: Yeah, I'm a god.

121
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:40,212
Scott: I like your show whatever and I'm like, okay Thanks.

122
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:42,725
Rym: Oh the guy and I was like, hey blah blah blah blah blah.

123
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:43,770
Rym: Why don't you grab a drink, right?

124
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,453
Scott: he didn't.

125
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:45,662
Scott: but and he was just like.

126
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:52,752
Scott: I'm just like, okay and It's like, you know and I sort of came off as jerky and he tweeted later like oh I don't.

127
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,960
Scott: he thought he was bothering me.

128
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:54,282
Scott: It's like.

129
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:57,537
Scott: no you weren't bothering me, dude You just didn't really say anything.

130
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,583
Scott: stop talking to start a conversation.

131
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:02,416
Scott: wise you were just sort of saying like, you know I like a show.

132
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:03,385
Scott: I listen all the time.

133
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:04,815
Rym: you were talking You know, he said.

134
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:07,170
Scott: he said that the reason he came to the show is good.

135
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,980
Scott: So the Maker Faire is because I told him about it.

136
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:12,958
Scott: Okay, that's cool But you didn't say anything.

137
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,084
Scott: that prompts a discussion.

138
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:15,289
Scott: So now I have nothing to say to you.

139
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,182
Scott: You're the person who knows who I am.

140
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:18,310
Scott: I don't even know your name.

141
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:19,468
Scott: I don't know anything about you.

142
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:20,996
Scott: So I have nothing to say to you.

143
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:25,857
Scott: if you want this discussion to continue in any kind of way You need to give me something to work with.

144
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,806
Scott: right maybe ask me something.

145
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:29,373
Scott: You know, it's funny It's not.

146
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:30,396
Scott: is that Google glass?

147
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,004
Scott: but like so have you played eggs video game?

148
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:34,810
Scott: or have you seen anything at the Maker Faire?

149
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,774
Scott: That was really cool.

150
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,884
Scott: Or did you see this cool thing over there?

151
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:38,587
Scott: I saw a man.

152
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:39,190
Scott: It was so awesome.

153
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,249
Scott: You know something like that.

154
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:46,810
Rym: There was just a comic that someone tweeted today that I saw it when I was catching up on all my tweets.

155
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:59,937
Rym: You know while I was pooping and the comic was basically Annoyance at that situation where someone else prompts conversation and then doesn't follow up after you respond Like hey, what you working on?

156
00:06:59,997 --> 00:07:00,881
Rym: I just did this thing.

157
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:03,130
Scott: Well, what you're working on that gives me something to work with.

158
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,950
Rym: Yeah, but then I you respond like I'm working on this and they say nice and then nothing else.

159
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:09,898
Scott: This is even one step beyond that.

160
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:11,504
Scott: this is they don't even ask a question.

161
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:12,930
Scott: you can answer like what you're working on.

162
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,801
Scott: It's just sort of like hey there.

163
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:15,424
Scott: Hey there.

164
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:18,600
Scott: Hi You know the end.

165
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:27,369
Rym: maybe we can blame Facebook and the fact that there is this sort of culture in social media of the poke or the prod or the.

166
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:31,483
Rym: Hey you there the sort of ping of yes, you still know who I am.

167
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,530
Rym: or yes, we have contacted each other.

168
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:39,203
Scott: Yeah, I guess the other one that's always bothered me I think I might have mentioned this many moons ago is can I ask you a question?

169
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:41,110
Scott: never say that in your life?

170
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,289
Rym: Well only if you have a question to go ahead and say that the answer is usually no.

171
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,690
Scott: Sure, if you are about to say, can I ask you something?

172
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,843
Scott: Can I ask you a question or anything similar to that instead?

173
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:54,330
Scott: You should just ask your question.

174
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:58,965
Scott: For example, if I want to know Rym What is the brand of that mixer that you just bought Mackie?

175
00:07:59,307 --> 00:07:59,649
Scott: There you go.

176
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:01,681
Scott: See, I shouldn't have said Rym can ask you a question.

177
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:01,922
Scott: Nope.

178
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:04,774
Scott: I Didn't know.

179
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:07,402
Rym: I have asked a a variant on this.

180
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:10,130
Rym: that I think is okay because I haven't you know the seat.

181
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:11,755
Scott: Well, you can say are you busy?

182
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,220
Scott: Yeah, you have a second.

183
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,330
Rym: or can I ask you an involved question?

184
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:24,817
Rym: Mm-hmm, maybe as in if you concede the point of me asking you this question I'm about to ask a fucker of a question.

185
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:31,015
Rym: Mm-hmm, like one that will require a preamble perhaps some supporting Documentation share whatever.

186
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,082
Scott: anyway, let us continue with some news of gaming.

187
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:34,946
Rym: Oh my god.

188
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:36,249
Rym: So, uh, yes team box.

189
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:40,570
Rym: Oh my gosh team has been rumored off and on for the last decade.

190
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:41,453
Scott: So you don't know.

191
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:44,910
Rym: the box looks like there's pictures that are mock-ups.

192
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,037
Scott: I guess I don't know people are talking about it.

193
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:47,941
Rym: Like there's like.

194
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:49,366
Scott: mostly it's the controller.

195
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:50,550
Scott: is the news, right?

196
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,418
Scott: No, that's the piston.

197
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,669
Scott: Yeah, that is the same box.

198
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,464
Rym: In fact, this headline is this is an article about what is the steam box and at the bottom.

199
00:08:58,026 --> 00:08:59,290
Rym: is the piston the steam box?

200
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:02,838
Rym: It's not I know but that's the question in the article.

201
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,704
Rym: is the piston the steam box?

202
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:09,596
Rym: and their answer is sort of It's not not wall.

203
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,344
Rym: The xi3 piston is not made by va valve.

204
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:16,636
Rym: It is associated with valve Project shield.

205
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,590
Rym: Oh, no, never mind this articles bullshit, right?

206
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,095
Scott: No, see what valve is doing is they've?

207
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:33,065
Scott: so it's part one steam OS which is a Linux distribution that when you boot it up We'll just boot up in steam big picture mode now Assuming it will play every single game on Steam without issue that has Linux support.

208
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:34,750
Rym: Uh, yeah useless.

209
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:40,214
Scott: And as to his links See that's the trouble.

210
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:46,110
Rym: the steam OS can't just be Linux that has to play every goddamn game or there's no goddamn point.

211
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:46,633
Scott: That's right.

212
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:46,954
Scott: Okay.

213
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:50,170
Scott: Anyway, but that's cool Linux distribution.

214
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,107
Scott: That's just open and free like all the old Linux distributions, but it runs steam right?

215
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:54,489
Scott: That's cool.

216
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:59,869
Scott: So part two is The controller really right?

217
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,670
Rym: The controller is if you haven't seen people talking about it or trying it out because you can try it out like it.

218
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,397
Rym: There's people who have had the ability to use it Instead of sticks.

219
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:11,663
Rym: It's just two touch pads.

220
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:15,490
Scott: You put your thumb on haptic touch pad So I can see what valve is going for here, right?

221
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:31,526
Scott: What they were going for is like look we our games are all PC games and our library is all these games that already exist and were made for mouse keyboards But you want to play them from the couch Rather than try to make a mouse keyboard like the phantom that works on the couch.

222
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,293
Scott: not gonna happen Right.

223
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,523
Scott: Well, we're gonna try to do is make a gamepad.

224
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:41,183
Scott: that is somehow You know good enough to do mouse keyboard.

225
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,890
Rym: So there's only one way for that to work.

226
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,205
Scott: It's got to have like a hundred buttons, of course, but the buttons they haven't been able to do.

227
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:56,170
Scott: but the touch pads are Way better than analog sticks in terms of being able to do the things a mouse can do right?

228
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:56,651
Scott: Maybe not.

229
00:10:56,732 --> 00:11:01,472
Scott: it's not quite as good as a mouse, but you know if it's a touch pad It's like.

230
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:07,627
Scott: well you could use a one-fingered touchpad to play Like, you know a game that involves a mouse.

231
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,376
Scott: so they can Better than using analog stick.

232
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:20,881
Rym: a lot of the games I play on steam are also Xbox games that work just fine with someone Right, but that's what I'm saying is those games aren't PC like for example Super Meat Boy, right?

233
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:21,427
Scott: Yeah, sir.

234
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,192
Scott: Meat Boy I have it.

235
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:24,383
Scott: you can get it on Steam or you can get an Xbox.

236
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,533
Scott: but that is a Console game.

237
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:31,370
Scott: you play it, you know an analog stick and a button is the primary input mode.

238
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:34,061
Rym: I don't know if that's the line I would make on console game.

239
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:35,687
Rym: I think we could make a better line.

240
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:36,390
Rym: I see your point.

241
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:40,570
Rym: I'm just saying I don't think that is necessarily the best definitional line.

242
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,157
Scott: I think that's the definition I'm using.

243
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:49,550
Scott: xcom right is a game That is a PC game, but they have it's on the Xbox on the ps3 on the iPad.

244
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:50,754
Scott: Yeah, right.

245
00:11:50,774 --> 00:11:58,186
Scott: Well, it's actually pretty good with a touchscreen better than better than with an analog stick and buttons Which is actually something I'm worried about in game design.

246
00:11:58,206 --> 00:12:08,423
Rym: in the long run I'm deathly afraid that games will start to have touchpad or tablet interfaces as their primary interfaces because that's God is sort of has that?

247
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:15,490
Rym: yeah, and that shit is Fatiguing as fuck if you're the kind of person who's gonna sit down and play a game for 12 hours pretty good in my way.

248
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:20,290
Rym: calm though I'm gonna try Emily's getting a new Wacom so I might take her old Wacom.

249
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:22,014
Scott: Doesn't that one not work?

250
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:23,679
Rym: I think it can be fixed.

251
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,923
Scott: That one's also way big.

252
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,810
Scott: Yeah, it is way smaller than that.

253
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,557
Rym: I'm not gonna carry it with me anywhere.

254
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:31,690
Scott: It's really I can't imagine playing it with the big one.

255
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:35,201
Rym: Anyway, though they're the they haven't their little manga whatever.

256
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:36,023
Rym: one is really small.

257
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:36,906
Rym: It's only a hundred bucks.

258
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:38,250
Scott: Oh that one.

259
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:38,952
Scott: Yeah, okay.

260
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:39,514
Scott: I got I got.

261
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:42,725
Scott: basically I got the smallest one of the better variety.

262
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:44,090
Scott: That's not a screen.

263
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:48,312
Rym: Yeah, so the pro whatever it's into a small I don't know.

264
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,377
Rym: Emily is getting the.

265
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:55,162
Scott: I mostly use it for photo editing in the Lightroom of That thing is I don't edit photos on that level.

266
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:56,368
Rym: I pretty much just do develop.

267
00:12:56,388 --> 00:13:03,495
Scott: well once I learned how to do it I was like oh snap and it's awesome because I can just be like oh look that person's hair is making this photo look Ugly not anymore.

268
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:06,069
Scott: Yeah, oh that person's got like a meds.

269
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:08,819
Scott: it It's me up not anymore, and you just like whoosh.

270
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:09,341
Scott: It's gone.

271
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:12,936
Scott: instead of like sitting there with the mouse clicking on it 20 times I just don't even bother.

272
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,089
Rym: Oh, I took a picture of you with this giant zit.

273
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,135
Rym: Awesome.

274
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:20,470
Scott: Wow when you look at the picture right it just like looks nasty.

275
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:24,329
Scott: Yeah, it you know like it stands out in the picture above other things.

276
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:27,422
Rym: well You know to be fair really depends on what kind of picture I took.

277
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:33,190
Rym: of course if I take a good picture Yes, I do that, but I can even do stuff like Oh background tourist whoosh.

278
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:40,150
Rym: but if I take say Documentary pictures of just an event I don't bother because I take like a hundred pictures.

279
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,512
Scott: Did you know?

280
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:43,229
Scott: if you're taking photos the Olympics you're not allowed to do anything to them.

281
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:44,655
Rym: I did not know that.

282
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:47,505
Scott: yeah, you're basically allowed to do almost nothing to the photos.

283
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:57,733
Rym: when you're if you're an Olympic photographer so Interesting I should get a drone fly it over the Olympics take a ton of pictures and beam them back right But you're right.

284
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:13,568
Scott: so the original point is that with the haptics combined with the high precision touch pads Being superior to analog sticks for those kinds of games that are better with Mouse keyboard touch screen than they are with analog stick which is the kind of game that's mostly

285
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,008
Rym: on It could be

286
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:20,824
Scott: But also good enough for games like a super meat boy.

287
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:25,275
Rym: It might be good enough for FPS's Depends on FPS.

288
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:26,942
Rym: Yeah, it's a hard to say you could play.

289
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:28,470
Scott: Maybe Wolfenstein or doom with it.

290
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:34,990
Scott: I don't know if you could play The trouble tribes - you don't have enough buttons you could probably play counter.

291
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:44,384
Rym: Well, they gave us a picture that I see here of all the buttons and the default bindings for portal - yeah Well portal - I think they met a designer with portal - in mind.

292
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:45,450
Scott: portal doesn't need a lot of buttons.

293
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,399
Rym: Let's see the buttons.

294
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,490
Scott: They remember the analog.

295
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,780
Scott: The touch pads are buttons if you push them in.

296
00:14:50,800 --> 00:15:06,699
Rym: yeah, they use those for like scrolling and zooming the left ones for moving Communication and the four buttons in the middle are kind of weird push to talk toggle zoom crouch Gesture menu chat message.

297
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:09,030
Rym: How the fuck am I gonna type a chat man voice?

298
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,495
Rym: No, that's the typing chat message.

299
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:13,601
Scott: Oh, it's not the character talk.

300
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:16,450
Rym: No, they've got a separate button for voice communication.

301
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:17,594
Scott: I don't fucking know.

302
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:19,020
Rym: I don't know either.

303
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,341
Rym: That's my.

304
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,735
Scott: there is there is a screen in the middle of it Like a Dreamcast controller.

305
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,720
Scott: who knows what they'll do with that.

306
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,570
Rym: It's not gonna be a tiny keyboard.

307
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,306
Rym: It could be a touchscreen though that I'm gonna type on.

308
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:28,870
Rym: I don't think so.

309
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,189
Scott: No It could be like, you know There could be things that you touch in the middle of it to do.

310
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:37,027
Scott: You know, like you press start on it and then the menu shows up and then you know, maybe we'll see.

311
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:40,501
Rym: with that The problem is the gaming media is going nuts about this thing.

312
00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:42,830
Rym: We know fuck all about it.

313
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,678
Rym: Yep, almost anything you hear anyone say is rumor.

314
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:50,609
Scott: Mmm other than the guy other than the three announcements valve made themselves.

315
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,363
Rym: Yes So three announcements, that's an auspicious number.

316
00:15:54,383 --> 00:16:01,863
Rym: I Wonder wonder if that means anything Because a troll face gave in.

317
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:07,135
Rym: as you pointed out They also have the trademark for half-life 3 Control double trophy.

318
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:09,242
Rym: if I were them I would just start trademarking.

319
00:16:09,362 --> 00:16:11,027
Scott: The troll meter is off the chart.

320
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:11,810
Rym: most bullshit.

321
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:18,082
Rym: I'd be like, yeah, I need a trademark for quarter life Full life half-life 2 squared.

322
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:27,030
Rym: You have half-life 2.5 Breaking life half bad full life Consequences Consequences.

323
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,053
Rym: So, we'll see.

324
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:40,579
Rym: I've said for a long time that valve should make a steam box or something like it though What I suspected they were gonna do back then would be to work with other people to where they'll make the boxes.

325
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:56,410
Rym: and if valve just put forward a set of like Hardware specs like a sort of minimum set of requirements for compatibility and you could get your things certified to be a steam box Instead they're actually going down the road of just making the hardware which is interesting.

326
00:16:58,073 --> 00:17:07,179
Rym: Well, I'm worried about the Linux part though Because as you said if it is a Linux OS and it doesn't somehow just play every game in this As far as I know it's just Linux.

327
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,262
Scott: It can't play Windows games.

328
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:08,866
Scott: I know.

329
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:12,490
Rym: so if that's true I think it's gonna be a ridiculous failure.

330
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:15,270
Scott: Well, I mean making more games that work on Linux.

331
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,849
Scott: You'd be actually be surprised if you went on Steam to Linux section.

332
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,969
Scott: How many games are in there and how many more games will be in there?

333
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,037
Scott: Nvidia actually was like, oh shit.

334
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:26,161
Scott: They're making this team thing.

335
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:27,486
Scott: Hey Linus.

336
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:28,510
Scott: You want to make up with you?

337
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,792
Scott: We know you hate us Right.

338
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:36,768
Scott: Nvidia was like, oh snap the fact that we Linux people hate us matters.

339
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:39,738
Scott: suddenly Let's make nice with them and they're being.

340
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,142
Scott: they're making nice with Linux again.

341
00:17:41,323 --> 00:17:42,105
Scott: Yeah the kernel.

342
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:43,570
Rym: so take that AMD.

343
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,500
Scott: Well, actually AMD would be on top if this went through.

344
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,470
Scott: AMD is also giving the chips to the two current consoles.

345
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:53,717
Scott: You know that that is true.

346
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:54,340
Scott: That is true.

347
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,587
Scott: the X bone and the ps4.

348
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:59,021
Rym: fine You know who's gonna take then, you know who's taking my that the.

349
00:17:59,142 --> 00:17:59,583
Rym: oh, yeah.

350
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:00,728
Scott: Sure.

351
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:01,230
Scott: He's dead.

352
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:04,142
Rym: This is this isn't the nail in the coffin of the you.

353
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:05,347
Rym: Yeah, this is like oh, yeah.

354
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:06,010
Scott: I was already dead.

355
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,773
Scott: It's already buried.

356
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:07,396
Scott: What are you talking about?

357
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:13,131
Rym: This is the last bit of chiseling on the tombstone That replaces the Credit.

358
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:16,678
Scott: this is someone visiting the oh, yeah long after its death and leaving a stone on the grave.

359
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,373
Rym: No, this is not even.

360
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:31,410
Rym: this is someone walking past the Uyas grave to leave a stone on the virtual boy's grave.

361
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:41,151
Rym: That person is the oculus, right I Guess we got to do things of the day at some point.

362
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:42,739
Rym: So things of the day we go.

363
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:48,620
Rym: As far as I can tell this is every episode of the real Ghostbusters just on YouTube.

364
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,390
Rym: So go nuts if you don't know what this is.

365
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:54,020
Scott: We've talked about watches every day after school.

366
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:59,762
Rym: I we were sitting here and I pulled up the clip just in the middle just to make sure it would play so I could remember That.

367
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:00,267
Rym: oh, right.

368
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,196

369
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,420
Rym: Scott was not looking at my screen and recognize the background music from this show.

370
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,122

371
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:09,148
Rym: This show was so important to my life.

372
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,820
Rym: I watched the real Ghostbusters and the bullshit Ghostbusters.

373
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,879
Scott: I didn't watch the bullshit one.

374
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:21,456
Rym: I watched the bullshit one only the real one because I was given a gift by a Far-off relative of some Ghostbusters toys.

375
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:26,590
Rym: Nope And they didn't match up with the show and I was really confused.

376
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,940
Rym: and then I found the other goes no internet in those days.

377
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:40,324
Scott: I know I didn't actually know about the bullshit Ghostbusters until way until internet times Because it was never on where I lived or I never watched it even though Ghostbusters came first.

378
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:45,198
Scott: Yeah, so I never knew why the real Ghostbusters was called real or anything like that until way later.

Scott: Yeah this weekend.

472
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:13,960
Scott: Yeah, you want to go to Albany this weekend and play netrunner.

473
00:25:14,442 --> 00:25:18,480
Rym: I don't really want to go and play netrunner, but I'd go but it's unlikely.

474
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:26,907
Scott: Anyway this Sunday there with that netrunner tournament in Albany is the special one the plugged in tour where the fantasy flight special prize.

475
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:34,279
Scott: and right this Sunday There's a netrunner tournament at the 20-sided store in Brooklyn where I will probably go to.

476
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:36,431
Scott: Then next week in New York comic-con.

477
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,860
Scott: the weekend after that is burning con.

478
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:45,059
Scott: but the Saturday of burning con the special netrunner tournament is gonna be at the strat in New York City Manhattan.

479
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:54,320
Scott: and Sunday of burning con the 20th of October The special netrunner tournament with the plugged in fantasy flight people is going to be at Kings games in the middle of fuck nowhere.

480
00:25:54,461 --> 00:25:57,175
Scott: Brooklyn out in the who knows where gonna go to that one.

481
00:25:57,195 --> 00:25:57,899
Scott: Hell no.

482
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:05,864
Scott: Then our book club book is Stasi land Stasi land, which I've read A few chapters up now.

483
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:08,835
Rym: Okay, you'll you'll there's the best story.

484
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:10,060
Scott: I read like a few chapters.

485
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,763
Scott: You'll blow through it.

486
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:13,637
Scott: I looked and I was like, oh, I'm like 15% done with this.

487
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:14,340
Scott: You'll blow through it.

488
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,934
Scott: It's a short it.

489
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:17,308
Scott: There's a reason I could wait so long to read.

490
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:25,880
Rym: it is because the best stories in a fast book that you haven't gotten to yet Are the guy who keeps that fucking plastic plate that he that is department one?

491
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,104
Scott: No, yeah that one right.

492
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:30,157
Rym: and the propaganda guy because he's just so crazy.

493
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:32,803
Scott: Okay Let's do the show.

494
00:26:32,823 --> 00:26:37,977
Rym: Yeah, well can you the show so Pac-man ced-x is.

495
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:39,220
Rym: it was literally.

496
00:26:39,421 --> 00:26:42,952
Scott: I'm pretty sure you've discussed it on the show before but I searched and we haven't dedicated.

497
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:50,720
Rym: an entire episode is literally the only Game I had on my Xbox that I didn't also have on Steam.

498
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:54,300
Rym: Thus it was the only reason I kept my Xbox.

499
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:59,905
Scott: I now there's a rather reason for me to have the Xbox which is I bought that rock fan But I never use it.

500
00:26:59,945 --> 00:27:02,340
Scott: so I could just got to sell it and then I'm okay.

501
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,288
Rym: Yeah, does anyone want two Xboxes and a rock band?

502
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:09,600
Scott: Yeah, I have the real guitar controller the one that's also a real guitar.

503
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:11,568
Rym: That really helped you learn the guitar.

504
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:14,479
Scott: Yeah, if I would have used it every day would have why didn't you use it every day?

505
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,180
Scott: Because I have no discipline.

506
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:27,104
Rym: It's funny because I had the discipline to like I don't know do quake one Clan Practices multiple nights.

507
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:31,015
Scott: I have discipline to play pac-man ced-x every goddamn day.

508
00:27:31,076 --> 00:27:32,600
Rym: You're way better than me at it.

509
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,789
Scott: I am according to steam according to Xbox.

510
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,598
Scott: I'm not but on the steam ced-x leaderboards.

511
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:40,702
Scott: I am 15th Overall.

512
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:45,079
Scott: that includes all the different modes and all the different scores and all the different mazes, right?

513
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,119
Scott: But there are a few people who have cheated on the leaderboards.

514
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:53,438
Scott: So I'm probably in the top 10 of best at pac-man.

515
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:57,159
Rym: Oh, I guess All my records and have to start over on steam.

516
00:27:58,001 --> 00:28:01,980
Rym: Yeah, I started over also, which is good because I lost a lot of my skills.

517
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,113
Scott: I haven't played much doesn't matter because it's not like you get negative.

518
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:06,880
Scott: It's just always your best of everything.

519
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,919
Scott: Oh, yeah, even if your things reported over that would actually help you.

520
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:17,020
Scott: Anyway, so pac-man ced-x plus or even ced-x is the best.

521
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:17,969
Scott: It's.

522
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:18,878
Scott: it is so good.

523
00:28:19,342 --> 00:28:25,353
Rym: Basically all it is is it took the Trappings of pac-man and the core can only say trapping of pac-man's.

524
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:26,397
Scott: it is 90% pack.

525
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:33,016
Rym: well, I said it take the trappings and the core conceits and It made a new game.

526
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:38,316
Rym: That is true to the spirit of pac-man but suffers from none of the problems of old pac-man.

527
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:40,884
Rym: because I will say this right now I like old pac-man.

528
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:42,648
Rym: It was an important game.

529
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:44,172
Rym: It was a good game.

530
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:52,412
Rym: It is still a pretty good game, but Competitive pac-man is one of the most boring and pointless things in the world.

531
00:28:52,512 --> 00:28:55,360
Scott: even competitive miss pac-man is pretty dumb.

532
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,540
Rym: It is no way better than competitive pac-man because once you're good, it's just an endurance contest.

533
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:06,133
Rym: I hate arcade classic records because they're the worst to watch.

534
00:29:06,414 --> 00:29:09,390
Rym: There's zero spectator component It's true.

535
00:29:09,816 --> 00:29:12,773
Scott: I mean There are some games that have a spectator.

536
00:29:12,874 --> 00:29:18,431
Rym: Oh, yeah, but like like Rob Root beer bubbles or beer rock ice cold beer ice cold beer.

537
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:24,960
Rym: Yeah, that's got a spectator component, but asteroids Yeah, I want to watch the guy walk away from the machine because he has so many lives.

538
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,395
Scott: I can't even like get a few lives and this guy's got like infinity.

539
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,620
Rym: Anyway, well, I had that problem.

540
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:42,520
Rym: You know I recognized this when I was very young in the Atari days because I was playing dig-dug on the Atari 2600 or kaboom and I never would really Lose like it was rare that I would die and the game was over.

541
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:45,229
Rym: It was always that my parents made me stop playing.

542
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,360
Rym: or I got bored or I wanted to go outside or I wanted juice.

543
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:50,369
Rym: I paused it and when I you died.

544
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:52,700
Scott: dig-dug we play every time we played dig do we played?

545
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,313
Rym: Yeah, everyone's they played on the arcade dig-dug.

546
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:58,581
Rym: I'm talking Atari 2600 dig-dug 200 not 7800.

547
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:04,723
Scott: you will never die unless you are not 2600 dig-dug but 7800 you will.

548
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,067
Scott: I'm pretty sure there was only the 2600 dig-dug.

549
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:15,053
Scott: Well, I know There's definitely a 7800 one that looks like a real dig-dug.

550
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:15,935
Scott: the 2600 one is mad ghetto.

551
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:21,460
Scott: Yes, you are correct.

552
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:21,883
Rym: So it's the 7800 one.

553
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:27,446
Scott: Yeah, the 7800 one is basically the same as the arcade in any s1 because I got a 7800 before I got an NES.

554
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:29,892
Scott: Okay.

555
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:30,975
Rym: Yeah the product.

556
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:35,990
Rym: but as a result, I have trouble remembering which games are on which system because it played every Atari game.

557
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,347
Rym: But yeah, I played.

558
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:41,230
Rym: one day I was like, I'm gonna be awesome and I'm gonna play this game and get the highest possible score.

559
00:30:41,732 --> 00:30:46,170
Rym: And then like six hours later, I turned it off because I just couldn't deal with it.

560
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,017
Scott: Alright, so here's so pac-man CEDX.

561
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:48,679
Scott: What is it about?

562
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,947
Scott: Well, it's the same exact rules of pac-man.

563
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:52,702
Scott: your pac-man You can move up down left.

564
00:30:52,762 --> 00:30:54,760
Scott: right in a maze There are ghosts that chase you.

565
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:56,070
Scott: if they touch you you die.

566
00:30:56,392 --> 00:30:58,846
Scott: If you eat a power pill the ghost turn blue for a while.

567
00:30:58,906 --> 00:30:59,430
Scott: you eat them.

568
00:30:59,832 --> 00:31:02,766
Scott: It's the same as pac-man you eat the pills.

569
00:31:02,806 --> 00:31:03,610
Scott: you want to eat all the pills.

570
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,494
Scott: Here are the rules.

571
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:07,808
Scott: changes from original pac-man to championship edition DX.

572
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:08,250
Scott: pac-man.

573
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:22,686
Scott: Every maze is split into two halves the left and the right At the start of the game if you eat all the regular pellets on one side of the map The fruit appears on the other side of the map in a pattern.

574
00:31:23,228 --> 00:31:30,990
Scott: in somewhere It appears where it appears when you eat a fruit the other side of the map will regenerate into a new map.

575
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,161
Scott: So let's say I eat all the pellets on the left.

576
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:33,322
Scott: Now.

577
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:34,770
Scott: The left board is empty.

578
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,858
Scott: There's no reason to go there.

579
00:31:36,442 --> 00:31:37,590
Scott: the fruit appeared on the right.

580
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,814
Scott: I eat the fruit on the right.

581
00:31:39,135 --> 00:31:44,114
Scott: the left side of the board now turns into a brand new maze full of pellets and All kinds of stuff.

582
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:47,509
Scott: so then I eat the fruit and all the pellets on the right.

583
00:31:47,992 --> 00:31:49,398
Scott: Then the fruit appears on the left.

584
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,185
Scott: I eat the fruit on the left.

585
00:31:51,346 --> 00:31:52,310
Scott: the right regenerates.

586
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:54,220
Scott: I eat the fruit and all the pellets on the left.

587
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:58,549
Scott: and so back and forth you go Right and eating all the pellets and all the fruits.

588
00:31:59,532 --> 00:32:00,724
Scott: That's rule change number one.

589
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:04,790
Scott: Rule change number two there are sleeping ghosts.

590
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:06,276
Scott: They're just chilling out sleeping.

591
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:09,088
Scott: if you go past a sleeping ghost it will wake up.

592
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:17,018
Scott: It will then decide whether to chase you or not chase you if there are currently no chasing ghosts on the map.

593
00:32:17,742 --> 00:32:23,799
Scott: it will chase you if There are chasing ghosts on the map But they're far away right now like they're on the other side.

594
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,454
Scott: somewhere like the chase train is not near you the ghost will go Back to sleep.

595
00:32:28,018 --> 00:32:33,010
Scott: if the chase train is right on your ass Which it is most of the time it will wake up and join the chase train.

596
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:41,575
Scott: So there's these chasing ghosts that are always chasing you in addition to the normal one through four free-roaming Ghosts that are in pac-man.

597
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:42,859
Scott: right those are just out there.

598
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:44,604
Scott: those aren't chasing you in the train.

599
00:32:44,624 --> 00:32:46,230
Scott: They're just pac-maning normal ghosts.

600
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:48,915
Scott: What other are those?

601
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:49,919
Scott: the only rule changes I?

602
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:51,813
Scott: Think those might.

603
00:32:51,893 --> 00:32:53,762
Scott: oh this bombs you have bombs.

604
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:55,190
Rym: Oh, yeah, I never think to use the bomb.

605
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:58,550
Scott: You should use the bombs all the night except on those puzzle ones okay?

606
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:05,430
Scott: So when you push the any button besides the arrows a bomb will go off that will take every ghost that is awake.

607
00:33:05,754 --> 00:33:16,949
Scott: So no sleeping ghosts But chasing ghosts and free-roaming ghosts And it will put them back in the middle of the map where ghosts in the ghost house And then they will immediately start pouring out of the ghost house again.

608
00:33:17,432 --> 00:33:20,625
Scott: So if you're in say surrounded by ghosts you push the bomb.

609
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:21,790
Scott: it clears out.

610
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:25,810
Scott: Another way to use the bomb is offensive bomb usage.

611
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:30,036
Scott: So let's say you're running around the map and the ghosts are chasing you But you're about to eat a power pill.

612
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:38,510
Scott: that means you have to turn around eat all the ghosts chasing you Then turn back around again and eat all the other ghosts that were sort of sleeping right.

613
00:33:39,113 --> 00:33:43,137
Scott: What you can do is let's say you go up the left side of the map Grab a power pill.

614
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:58,170
Scott: if you use the bomb early enough in advance The ghosts will be coming out of the ghost house at that time And you can eat them as they come out of the goat house ghost house and not have to backtrack And you'll save like five to ten seconds of backtracking and forward tracking.

615
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,810
Rym: Because remember this is a game that has many different modes.

616
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,610
Rym: But it's it's either a game of time trial like down to the millisecond right.

617
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,290
Scott: There's score mode time trial mode and ghost combo mode which sucks.

618
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:11,429
Rym: Ghost combo mode is the worst mode right?

619
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:24,678
Scott: It's all about time trial mode and score mode and score mode is Sort of like you still are in a hurry in score mode because the faster you go the more fruits you eat The more ghosts you know the more chances you have to eat ghosts.

620
00:34:24,998 --> 00:34:26,965
Scott: speed is really important in score mode.

621
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:33,550
Scott: in time trial mode Though score time is speed is the only thing that's important, so you will skip past ghosts.

622
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,217
Scott: You're not trying to eat a lot of ghosts.

623
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:37,610
Scott: You're trying to avoid eating ghosts, right?

624
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:42,610
Scott: Because that takes a lot of time and in time trial mode you just want to eat the pellets and the fruits.

625
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,909
Scott: It's all about just how fast can you eat X number of fruits go?

626
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,130
Scott: Alright, so you want to avoid the ghosts with the bomb?

627
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:57,022
Scott: So a lot of times if there's a part of the map where you can't avoid hitting a ghost you'll bomb in advance Because whenever you get near a ghost you don't just die immediately.

628
00:34:57,243 --> 00:35:00,961
Scott: you go into like matrix pac-man mode But the timer still keeps going.

629
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:02,610
Scott: like a timer is real time.

630
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,870
Scott: So you don't want to go into matrix mode you want to get those goes bombed?

631
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:09,829
Scott: Right before you get close to them, so you don't slow down and use the matrix speed.

632
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:23,085
Scott: Also when you're in that matrix mode right the ghosts depending on the kind of ghost it is a free-roaming ghost or Chasing ghost it may actually just not come at you.

633
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:35,090
Scott: like if you're at an intersection And there's a ghost coming right at you you can usually just turn and get out of its way or more often than not It will just turn and get out of your way, and you can keep going straight

634
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,460
Rym: Just like in regular pack.

635
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,325
Scott: you just have to be aware Is that a chasing ghost or is it a free-roaming ghost?

636
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:42,390
Scott: if it's a chasing ghost?

637
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,379
Scott: Like if the chasing ghost line is right in front of you.

638
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:47,667
Scott: It's gonna come right at you right.

639
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:48,590
Scott: it wants to chase you.

640
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,185
Scott: That's all it will do is chase you wherever you are.

641
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:51,930
Scott: come straight at you.

642
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,743
Scott: It'll never turn away kind of like if you play snakes right.

643
00:35:55,045 --> 00:36:11,330
Scott: a free-roaming ghost Will turn out of the way if you come straight at it face to face most of the time unless There's no sort of intersection right there like if you meet it sort of in the middle of an alley And there's nowhere for it to turn yeah Then it's gonna come right at you and you can either die or use a bomb.

644
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:15,670
Scott: And if you run it you can get bombs by eating ghosts that have bombs in their bellies.

645
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:17,690
Scott: Or you can also get power pellets.

646
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,589
Scott: There's some ghosts with power pellets in them.

647
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:30,550
Scott: So if you get the power pill you can then eat a ghost with a power pill and replenish the power pill and basically Keep the game in a perpetual state of always being able to eat ghosts.

648
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:34,584
Rym: But then the game becomes almost a challenge of how long can you keep that up right?

649
00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:35,226
Scott: basically what you.

650
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:40,009
Scott: the reason you would use That mode is if you would just eat in a megaton of ghosts in a ghost chain.

651
00:36:40,694 --> 00:36:50,850
Scott: Then you keep going through the map really quickly But you keep the chain going to add more and more ghosts to your ghost combo Because the first ghost you eat is worth like a piddly amount of points.

652
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,159
Scott: But like eventually it gets up to a maximum.

653
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:55,869
Scott: as thing is this is 32,000 per go something like that.

654
00:36:56,451 --> 00:37:00,161
Scott: And if you every additional ghost you eat will give you big big points.

655
00:37:00,723 --> 00:37:06,118
Scott: right, but if you're going for score Unless you can eat every sleeping ghost.

656
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,932
Scott: you probably want the power pill to run out so that you can wake up the ghost get To chase.

657
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:14,950
Scott: you form the chain and then eat them all at once when you get a power pill.

658
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:16,836
Rym: But the the fun of this game.

659
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:23,815
Rym: the reason I like it so much is that the music rate the same reason hot Something so great.

660
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:32,084
Scott: Yeah, it's definitely as good as hotline Miami music same level of oh my god I am in this and it's almost the sort of same genre as hotline Miami.

661
00:37:32,144 --> 00:37:33,930
Scott: right how perfect can you do this thing?

662
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,750
Rym: Well, that's what I was getting at.

663
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,636
Rym: This is not a game.

664
00:37:35,697 --> 00:37:38,608
Rym: if you want to play this game kind of casually It's not actually that fun.

665
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:46,644
Rym: the game is only fun if you are trying to beat your own time and you get to within a Millisecond and failed.

666
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:56,569
Scott: yesterday I played a map and I had a new technique for improving my time and I ended up with the exact same high score that I had previously to the second to the hundredth of a.

667
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:03,290
Rym: Playing this game reminds me of a lot of those days when you me and Pete would hang around in beacon With the ultra hard mode event zero.

668
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:06,261
Rym: Yeah, same thing and just you'd start a race and then restart.

669
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:07,465
Rym: because you know, you fucked up.

670
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:08,630
Rym: restart restart restart.

671
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,855
Scott: I mean they make it really.

672
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,865
Scott: you just press select twice and you restart.

673
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,050
Scott: so it's really easy.

674
00:38:13,151 --> 00:38:13,714
Scott: Just restart.

675
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:18,779
Scott: if you mess up like I'll do a time trial and if I take a wrong turn I'll just press select twice and start from the beginning.

676
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:20,225
Rym: It's just immediately just BAM.

677
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:23,490
Scott: Yep, and It lets you restart pretty much instantly.

678
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:25,255
Rym: But this is a game of.

679
00:38:25,456 --> 00:38:29,930
Rym: it's not really multiplayer either other than comparing your scores in the leaderboard.

680
00:38:30,573 --> 00:38:31,900
Rym: It is purely a game of.

681
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:35,675
Rym: do you want to master this Incredibly specific little thing?

682
00:38:35,695 --> 00:38:42,416
Rym: and it'll probably I mean it'll increase your reaction times and everything and sure like the game Scientific evidence for that.

683
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:58,510
Rym: Well, like the game will go crazy sometimes and you just have to wing it like if you've bombed in certain situations avoid the ghost and kind of get back on track, but Really a big part of the game is memorization of patterns and then memorization of how to respond to those patterns.

684
00:38:58,791 --> 00:38:59,092
Scott: Mm-hmm.

685
00:38:59,614 --> 00:39:06,059
Scott: Yeah, pretty much you have to learn each maze and how it works, right and Different mazes have different things going on.

686
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:14,950
Scott: right like the junction maze is all about Basically going in these tight loops and then the ghost chain is too long and you're gonna bump into its ass like in snake.

687
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:23,548
Scott: Yeah, right and you have to instead take different paths that go, you know Use the warping from the bottom to the top of the map to make to get the ghost chain longer So you don't bump into it.

688
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:32,261
Scott: But then the highway one is like these long Highway is long and straight from left to right, right You have the new mountain course is really cool.

689
00:39:32,301 --> 00:39:34,250
Scott: Basically what you do is you go from bottom to top on them.

690
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:40,756
Scott: Oh, yeah I guess they're gonna go bottom to top on the right and it's like you feel like you're climbing a mountain Pass going from left to right.

691
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:42,882
Rym: Oh Ashland says rofl badass.

692
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:44,266
Rym: Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.

693
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:44,808
Rym: break a leg.

694
00:39:44,928 --> 00:39:47,970
Rym: Okay It was an arm and that was in Australia.

695
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:52,884
Scott: Yeah but pretty much every different map has like a. you know half half is my favorite.

696
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,007
Scott: actually I think cuz a half.

697
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:55,512
Scott: what you do is Half.

698
00:39:55,572 --> 00:40:00,990
Scott: the map is loaded up with these ghosts and these pells and you really get to clear the sleeping ghosts out of the way.

699
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:08,682
Scott: So you can get to the pills and like layer by layer you peel away and then when you finish clearing it out You eat the last pill on that side of the map.

700
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:09,830
Scott: you go through the tunnel.

701
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:16,053
Scott: You come out the right side of the map where the fruit is just waiting all on its own because it's only the left half Of the map matters.

702
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:22,581
Scott: the right half of the map is just grab the fruit then go back into the left side again Which is now replenish the hats in particular.

703
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:28,710
Rym: That's it's a test of Memorization and puzzle-solving while reacting in real time.

704
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:37,590
Scott: Yeah, well the memorization one is really darkness Which is where you have to basically time trial each other map in the dark to remember where to go.

705
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:47,710
Scott: Yeah, right you can see the pills and the pellets but you can't really see the maze except for the immediate area around pac-man and you can See obviously the path the pills are making and you can see the ghosts.

706
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:56,089
Scott: So you just are at to remember from the other modes what the optimal path is to take and like where the exit where the turns So you can anticipate them in advance.

707
00:40:57,432 --> 00:41:00,370
Scott: The darkness is time trial only it doesn't have a score mode.

708
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:05,870
Rym: So yeah, it's a super fun game and you guys should play it so we can compare in the leaderboard on steam.

709
00:41:06,051 --> 00:41:07,274
Scott: I challenge anyone.

710
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:17,067
Scott: I am probably top 10 in the world at this game except maybe I don't know if they had the weird You know, obviously this price and not to be all racist, but I'm gonna be racist.

711
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:17,930
Scott: This is racist.

712
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:22,670
Scott: There is definitely Japanese people who are way better than this than me and they're probably just not on our leaderboard.

713
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,179
Rym: You should enter a tournament if there's one at like a PAX.

714
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,854
Scott: They've had them at PAX every year for a while now You should enter one.

715
00:41:29,994 --> 00:41:33,322
Scott: I haven't been able to enter one due to difficulties scheduling.

716
00:41:33,442 --> 00:41:34,385
Scott: Otherwise, I would have.

717
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:44,303
Scott: but yeah, they've had pac-man CE tournaments at PAX every year for a few years, so Because this was also a gaming news roundup.

718
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:50,044
Rym: There's one last little thing here I want to talk about because I just saw this in Zelda a link between worlds.

719
00:41:50,786 --> 00:41:55,966
Rym: They made a big point That you can play the dungeons in any order, uh-huh.

720
00:41:56,368 --> 00:42:02,500
Rym: now One could argue maybe that could be like Zelda 1 where you can get to a lot of them But not all of them.

721
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:07,988
Rym: That would be a good thing But you'd have to fight your way through like you could just go to level 8 and go and get that fucking book.

722
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:10,025
Scott: if it's Like Megaman, I don't know about that.

723
00:42:11,351 --> 00:42:12,276
Rym: Here's what worries me.

724
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,370
Rym: I'm gonna read from this article on joystick.

725
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:17,318
Scott: Oh during the latest forward to this game during

726
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:24,020
Rym: the latest Nintendo Direct presentation Nintendo president revealed that the game will arrive on the 3ds on November 22nd in Europe,

727
00:42:24,402 --> 00:42:24,744
Scott: okay,

728
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:33,030
Rym: and He revealed that the game will dramatically alter the traditional Zelda formula allowing players to tackle dungeons in whatever order they choose.

729
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,389
Rym: Here's the problem.

730
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:45,390
Rym: This will be possible Thanks to a special shop where link can rent and purchase items that would normally only be found in dungeons Including the hookshot boomerang and hammer.

731
00:42:46,194 --> 00:42:49,370
Scott: So you go into a shop with your rupees and you rent a hook shot.

732
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:57,010
Scott: You rent a hook shot to do the hook shot dungeon you couldn't normally do To get and then you get something in that right to do the dungeons out of order.

733
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:01,146
Scott: I'll just do them in order and fuck that shop and not spend a rupee rupees on that shit.

734
00:43:01,387 --> 00:43:04,675
Rym: Yep No, I don't know.

735
00:43:04,795 --> 00:43:07,666
Scott: wait so if I but I guess you still need all the pieces of the Triforce.

736
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:08,530
Scott: that's not a big deal.

737
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:09,602
Scott: Yeah, I guess it's so.

738
00:43:09,623 --> 00:43:10,149
Scott: you know what it is.

739
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:20,570
Rym: It's more that the the games have gone more and more toward this road of hard Barriers like well, here's the area you can't get through until you get the hookshot later and while that's exist.

740
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:22,130
Scott: So the one had that walls.

741
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:29,297
Rym: I'll hear that raft the primary thing preventing you from getting to a lot of areas Which is that you are not fucking good at that game.

742
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:31,102
Rym: and then link was way we go.

743
00:43:31,183 --> 00:43:33,931
Scott: watch the stream of Zelda 1.

744
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:34,593
Scott: It's two parts.

745
00:43:35,035 --> 00:43:36,680
Scott: The second part is mostly just the last level.

746
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:37,001
Scott: Yep.

747
00:43:37,443 --> 00:43:40,165
Scott: Oh, no, I think the second part starts at level 7 Maybe whatever.

748
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:49,342
Scott: But yet that you can watch the early part of it where I go to get the white sword and there's the blue Centaur guy with who shoots swords at you guarding the white sword room.

749
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:50,225
Rym: Wait, let me guess.

750
00:43:50,245 --> 00:43:51,088
Rym: Did you do the up?

751
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:52,196
Rym: He's facing me.

752
00:43:52,276 --> 00:43:53,590
Rym: fuck leave the screen come back up.

753
00:43:53,710 --> 00:44:04,324
Scott: I did that like 20 times until I could finally sneak past him because when you have nothing but the sword and The tiny shield you can't deal with that guy, right?

754
00:44:04,404 --> 00:44:05,850
Scott: It's not like you can't go there.

755
00:44:06,132 --> 00:44:08,069
Scott: It lets you go wherever you want in the overworld map.

756
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,350
Scott: It's just that guy will fucking kill you if you are not powerful enough.

757
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,670
Scott: That is what's keeping you out and I wish you know more games did stuff like that.

758
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,868
Rym: I wish more Zelda games did things like that.

759
00:44:17,928 --> 00:44:24,789
Scott: Yeah Well, I mean, I guess Dark Souls does that right but it's they keep you out of everything with every guy because they're all hard.

760
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:29,637
Rym: So, yeah, I don't know.

761
00:44:29,657 --> 00:44:39,199
Scott: I've been less and less enjoying Zelda games of time has gone on Always the newer ones, um, one more thing is the mighty number nine If you don't know what we're like number nine.

762
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,002
Scott: How have you been?

763
00:44:40,022 --> 00:44:41,086

Scott: Yeah, the Kickstarter ends already by the time we're listening to this.

766
00:44:46,462 --> 00:44:49,170
Scott: Let me let me go check the exact timing on that.

767
00:44:49,451 --> 00:44:50,033
Rym: I backed it.

768
00:44:50,795 --> 00:44:51,517
Scott: who didn't back it?

769
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:53,504
Scott: fools fools did not back.

00:44:53,524 --> 00:45:00,790
Rym: I think this is gonna be One of those games that's gonna come out and I'm gonna actually play it for real.

771
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:03,726
Scott: As of this moment recording it has 47 minutes to go.

00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:16,963
Scott: Oh, no, 46 minutes to go is too late.

776
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:17,225
Scott: Nope.

777
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:22,101

Scott: I think that's the version I'm gonna play.

780
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,209
Rym: Whoa, like I just went to Kickstarter to look at that and I found this other project right here.

00:45:31,631 --> 00:45:33,977
Rym: It's a you know bread baking machines.

782
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:36,203
Scott: Yeah, like the ones that bread man.

783
00:45:36,364 --> 00:45:38,490
Rym: Yeah, this is a beer making machine.

784
00:45:39,332 --> 00:45:40,684
Scott: Why do you need a machine to make beer?

785
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:41,430
Scott: Don't you need just a bucket?

786
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:43,581
Rym: You have to do some other things.

787
00:45:43,642 --> 00:45:44,570
Rym: It's not just a bucket.

788
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:51,549
Scott: So you just put all the ingredients in different apartments and it makes it seems to be it's an automatic micro brewing machine.

789
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,873
Scott: Okay, interesting.

790
00:45:53,893 --> 00:45:54,655
Scott: All right.

791
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:58,205
Scott: Anyway, yeah, just put the hops in the hop hopper and I'm pretty.

792
00:45:58,326 --> 00:45:59,770
Rym: I'm pretty excited for mighty number nine.

793
00:45:59,871 --> 00:46:02,127
Scott: Actually, yeah, I'm playing the hell out of that.

794
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:06,739
Rym: I'm also Thinking about going five because it's gonna be cold soon.

795
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:08,264
Rym: We have all those expansions.

796
00:46:08,284 --> 00:46:10,835
Rym: We're gonna play some multiplayer said five Let's do it.

797
00:46:10,996 --> 00:46:12,770
Scott: I'm any time anyone's to start to sit five.

798
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,821
Rym: I basically it's got to get a little bit colder cuz I'm still going outside.

799
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:18,210
Scott: I've basically figured out my sieve five strategy already.

800
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,415
Scott: I know exactly what I'm gonna do.

801
00:46:19,555 --> 00:46:20,358
Rym: What's your strategy?

802
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:21,985
Scott: I should I tell you right now.

803
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:23,270
Rym: I have my strategy.

804
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:25,316
Rym: I'm gonna be the Greeks have horsemen.

805
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:28,244
Rym: I'm gonna fuck people up in the early stages.

806
00:46:28,424 --> 00:46:28,966
Scott: That's definitely.

807
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:34,379
Scott: you get definitely have Killing like one dude early, right?

808
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:37,669
Scott: It's sort of like having losing a doubloon early in Puerto Rico, right?

809
00:46:38,372 --> 00:46:40,149
Scott: It just has his ripple effect through the whole game.

810
00:46:40,451 --> 00:46:45,695
Rym: The thing is if you just kill someone else early, you don't get that much out of it But they lose a lot.

811
00:46:45,735 --> 00:46:50,710
Scott: you just have to ruin the other people early and then defend your shit.

812
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:52,137
Scott: You don't killing someone out.

813
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:57,050
Scott: It's attacking the cities early and sieve five We'll just fuck you because the cities are so dangerous.

814
00:46:57,433 --> 00:46:59,949
Rym: But no, you said just kill like that one settler.

815
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,822
Scott: You can kill his one settler per worker or you can just ruin his.

816
00:47:03,883 --> 00:47:07,936
Rym: like the thing is worker just worked or just go Over there and then he'll be afraid.

817
00:47:07,976 --> 00:47:10,925
Rym: So his guy hides in the city and then isn't working anything.

818
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:14,034
Scott: It's also a good idea Things like that.

819
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:15,640
Scott: you got his head the harassment going on.

820
00:47:15,681 --> 00:47:15,881
Scott: Yep.

821
00:47:16,022 --> 00:47:17,910
Scott: Also the defense that you're not the harassed guy.

822
00:47:18,392 --> 00:47:22,969
Rym: I'm also a kind of confident in my advanced wars and skills to see me through.

823
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:27,501
Scott: Yeah, my strategy actually minimizes the advanced wars that is.

824
00:47:27,521 --> 00:47:31,634
Rym: but some of the people who I know will be playing even playing a lot More said five than me.

825
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:34,910
Rym: So I gotta play a lot more said five couldn't play so much on the plane.

826
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:38,300
Scott: So I'm playing a lot of pac-man.

827
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,210
Rym: It's gotta get colder before I do this and p-cross.

828
00:47:42,714 --> 00:47:43,469
Rym: So yeah, we're back.

829
