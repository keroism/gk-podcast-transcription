1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,926
Rym: It's Wednesday, October 29th.

2
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:12,607
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,648 --> 00:00:13,189
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:14,592
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:17,519
Rym: Tonight, the life and times of Scrooge McDuck.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:46,600
Rym: So one of the things we often do when we have the Visigoths over for a burning weekend is we we sit around in the living room doing nothing, trying to think of what to do, watching YouTube videos and/or random anime while we try to figure out what we actually want to do.

8
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,140
Scott: Well, I, you know, say we should play a board game, we should play a board game, and if people actually played one, we had plenty of time.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,555
Scott: But everyone just goes, "Eh...".

10
00:00:54,781 --> 00:01:00,880
Rym: Well, I think part of the problem is that when we have too many people over, we don't have enough people for two full board games.

11
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,617
Scott: Yeah, we do.

12
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:04,239
Rym: Not if you count only people who want to play board games.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,779
Scott: Maybe everyone should want to play board games.

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,108
Rym: What if I was into, I don't know, BDSM?

15
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:11,720
Rym: Should everyone who comes over want to be into BDSM?

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,640
Scott: No, but your BDSM people can BDSM, and then everyone else will play board games.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:25,020
Rym: So your board game people can board game, but the problem is you have, we always have, like, exactly one more person or one less person than we need to play board games.

18
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,599
Scott: Well, then that person can go BDSM.

19
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:29,120
Rym: I guess that works out for everyone.

20
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:39,535
Rym: But, you know, the problem is we, maybe it's just short attention spans, or maybe it's just because we don't want to watch a whole long movie because we want to do other stuff, so we'll always end up just...

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,400
Scott: What, watch another short thing, and we could have watched a movie instead of the two short things?

22
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:45,380
Rym: Instead, we'll watch a medium-length thing.

23
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,500
Rym: We'll watch one episode of an anime, usually based solely on the title.

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:57,131
Rym: Now, Emily is listening to this now, I'm sure, and she's probably yelling at the radio or the iPod, saying, "I warned you guys.

25
00:01:57,513 --> 00:01:58,017
Rym: I warned

26
00:01:58,057 --> 00:01:58,198
Rym: you.".

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,242
Rym: But, you know what?

28
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:04,020
Rym: She warns us all the time, and I think we actually like ending up watching really bad shows.

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:18,200
Scott: Well, no, I don't like actually watching the entire length of a bad show, but I like to, you know, spend a few minutes looking at all the different shows out there to see what they're like, you know, see what the animation quality is, see what the character design is, you know.

30
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:20,020
Scott: It only takes like ten seconds.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,780
Rym: The cool thing I found is that if it's a really good show, it's great.

32
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:36,820
Rym: Like, when you're watching Baccano, it's just like the best thing ever, but if it's a terrible show, like a god-awful show, or just a really messed up show, it's also great because you get this kind of shared experience of something so bad.

33
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:46,640
Scott: Yeah, and if you actually know what the shows are going to be in advance, the whole surprise and, you know, mystery element is gone, and then it's no longer enjoyable to do this.

34
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,576
Rym: But at the same time, there's been a lot of times when Emily will be like, "Don't watch that show, it's Moe

35
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:51,880
Rym: Crap!".

36
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,840
Rym: And we turn it on, and sure enough, Moe Crap.

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,771
Rym: But this one, she wasn't sure.

38
00:02:56,872 --> 00:03:04,536
Rym: None of us recognized the title, and before we put it on, I pointed it out to everyone, and I said this multiple times, "Look, the title ends in

39
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:04,999
Rym: Chon.".

40
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:06,880
Scott: I was the one who pointed out the title ends in Chon.

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,436
Rym: But I'm the one who said, "This is going to be Moe Pedophile

42
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:10,838
Rym: Crap.".

43
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:14,720
Scott: I was pretty sure it was going to be Moe Pedophile Crap, too, based on the title.

44
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,190
Scott: The title is, "Yawaraka Sengoku Shi Tsuki Sase!

45
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,112
Scott: Reo Fuku-chan," and it's an OAV.

46
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,339
Rym: Now the thing is, we're like, "Alright, let's see, it's going to be a Moe Crap

47
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:28,480
Rym: show.".

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,200
Rym: We turn it on, not Moe Crap.

49
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:35,439
Rym: It looks kind of really interesting, well, for about 15 seconds.

50
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:44,080
Scott: There was an angry dude who seemed like he was some sort of ancient warrior of some sort, and he was going on and on about being awesome in some way.

51
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,720
Rym: And it's like a green, black and white film thing.

52
00:03:48,100 --> 00:04:05,040
Scott: Well, he was sort of in the shadows, he couldn't see what he was up to, and he couldn't really see his whole face, he just sort of saw the shape of his head, and he was talking to somebody, and something was happening, maybe an epic battle of some sort, you know, even if it wasn't going to be a good show, it was going to have some sort of cool setting of badassness.

53
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:11,779
Rym: Now, I'm still saying, "No, watch, this is going to turn into Moe Pedophile Crap real quick, just wait for

54
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:11,900
Rym: it.".

55
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,299
Rym: I'm sure, I can feel it.

56
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,042
Rym: See, I

57
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:37,149
Scott: thought, right, that, uh, I still thought it was going to turn into Moe Pedophile Crap, but as soon as I saw that guy on the screen, I'm like, "No, no, no, no, this is too, you know, there are shows that come in normally, they come in with, you know, sort of an average show kind of feel, and then they go to Moe, but there's never a show that comes in, like, with Fist of the North Star Force of, you know, manliness, and then- We need to make

58
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:37,780
Rym: a show like that.

59
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,487
Scott: -switches to Moe.

60
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:42,060
Scott: It's like, it's too far apart, you can't move that far.

61
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,640
Scott: You can move from badassness to normalness, or normalness to Moe, but you can't go all the way.

62
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:59,638
Rym: Though, the closest thing I've seen is that one, uh, When They Cry, I forget the title in Japanese, but that was the show that, the opener was like, "Moe, weird crap," like, "Alright, it's a Moe

63
00:04:59,678 --> 00:04:59,839
Rym: show.".

64
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:05,260
Rym: And then, the beginning of the anime was, uh, a dude beating someone visually to death with a baseball bat.

65
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:07,138
Scott: Okay.

66
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,358
Rym: You don't remember that?

67
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:09,980
Scott: The opener?

68
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,380
Rym: The opener was like, "Moe crap," and the show looks very like a Moe show.

69
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:22,080
Rym: But, before the opener, it's the main character beating someone to death horribly with a baseball bat.

70
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,039
Scott: Do you remember what the show was about?

71
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:29,680
Rym: Uh, yeah, it was a murder mystery kind of thing that kept repeating, it was kind of weird- Oh, that's the Higurashi, whatever, whatever.

72
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,779
Rym: Yes, When They Cry.

73
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,097
Scott: Yeah, but the part you're supposed to mention to make someone remember that show is that-.

74
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:49,260
Scott: Well, the actual show, like, the whole middle of the first episode is like a Moe school- it's not Super Moe, but it's a sort of happy school show, and then at the end, there's some horrible lay reunion murder thing you find out about, and the girls come in with, like, the crazy blade.

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,960
Rym: What stood out to me was that, before the opener, it was the vicious beating of someone to death with a metal baseball bat.

76
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,880
Scott: You see, I forgot that, because, you know what I mean?

77
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:01,477
Rym: And we're watching this going, "Whoa, this could be interesting,".

78
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,856
Rym: and then the opener was Moe, and we're like, "What?

79
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:06,009
Scott: What?".

80
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:12,220
Rym: But no, this show, then it changes up again, because this guy, it's something like he gets cast out of the heavens.

81
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,640
Scott: Yeah, we're talking about the show we watch now, not Higurashi anymore.

82
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:28,860
Rym: And then it cuts to the guy, like, yelling and falling from the sky, and then it cuts to his horse, also yelling and falling from the sky, at which point, almost all of us were convinced that this is actually going to be a crazy, wacky kind of comedy show.

83
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:35,400
Rym: And they land, and immediately, 11-year-old girls with shiny boobs.

84
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:38,257
Scott: Yeah, let me read this plot summary here.

85
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,938
Scott: "The great three kingdoms general, Ryo-Fu-Hosen, is cast from the

86
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:43,280
Scott: heavens.".

87
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,798
Scott: So that explains the badass dude, and that explains him falling to earth, yelling and screaming with a horse.

88
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,986
Scott: And together with his first officer, that explains the other person falling from the sky.

89
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,334
Scott: "Incarnated as a preteen

90
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:55,638
Scott: girl."

91
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,777
Scott: Outstanding.

92
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,539
Rym: What genre do they possibly put this in?

93
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,357
Scott: "The genres are action, comedy, and magic, but under themes, they wrote

94
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:07,719
Scott: ecchi.".

95
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,200
Rym: I think they missed pedophilia.

96
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,033
Scott: Yeah.

97
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,058
Rym: Now, you might think, "Oh, Rym and Scott, you're overreacting to the mo-".

98
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:15,139
Rym: No.

99
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:18,459
Rym: It's not cool.

100
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,220
Scott: You only gotta watch 15 seconds of this to see what we're talking about.

101
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:25,440
Rym: 11-year-old, I assume that's how old they are.

102
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,718
Rym: Should not be that shiny.

103
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,839
Scott: It says preteen.

104
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,400
Scott: That means 12 or less, I'm assuming, because 13 is the first teen.

105
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:32,889
Rym: Yeah.

106
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,459
Rym: Even though 11 and 12 are always weird, because they have the weird names, they don't follow all the other names of the numbers.

107
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:40,720
Scott: Whatever.

108
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:41,411
Scott: They don't.

109
00:07:41,947 --> 00:07:42,180
Scott: Okay.

110
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,480
Rym: Even in other romantic languages, they really don't.

111
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:46,277
Scott: Yeah, they do.

112
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:47,707
Rym: 11, 12, as opposed to- Yeah.

113
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:50,800
Rym: In Spanish, right?

114
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:52,240
Rym: Oh, Scott, that's what I said.

115
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,659
Rym: All the other romantic languages.

116
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:54,591
Scott: Yeah.

117
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:57,100
Scott: They do have all the things that are the same.

118
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:57,840
Rym: No, they don't.

119
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,452
Rym: French doesn't.

120
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,016
Rym: Well, in Spanish- "Uns, dos, tres, quatorz, canse,

121
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:02,479
Rym: dicêtres.".

122
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,880
Scott: Well, in Spanish, it's "dies" is 10, right?

123
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,815
Scott: And then it's "unse, dos, se, tres, se, quatorz, se,

124
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:08,217
Scott: quince.".

125
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:10,149
Rym: It's a little more different in French.

126
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,859
Rym: Anyway, the point is, show is not good.

127
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,377
Scott: Oh, my God.

128
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,499
Scott: No, don't watch this.

129
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,500
Scott: The worst thing is- Only watch the first 10 seconds of this OAV.

130
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:22,239
Scott: To see the humor of what we're talking about.

131
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,980
Rym: We're testing out the Boxee, so it's got these cool functions.

132
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,760
Rym: We're trying to pick something else to watch.

133
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:38,860
Rym: But because of the way it works, the show keeps playing in the background because the menus are all kind of translucent, and we can't make it stop until we pick something else to watch.

134
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,700
Scott: I could've made it stop, but when I had to exit the menu, made it stop and then enter the menu again.

135
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,580
Rym: Yes, or pick something else to watch.

136
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,780
Rym: But being indecisive, we had to see another 45 seconds of the show.

137
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:51,760
Scott: I was ignoring that and paying attention to the menus, and the audio was just sort of "ma-ro-ro-ro" in the background.

138
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,647
Rym: I believe it was

139
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:53,779
Rym: "meh-meh-meh-meh-meh-meh-meh.".

140
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,698
Scott: Well, yeah, that too.

141
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,096
Scott: "Meh-meh-meh-meh-meh-meh.".

142
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:56,839
Scott: Okay.

143
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:59,760
Rym: Anyway, at least I have been watching good anime, I promise.

144
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:01,220
Scott: I haven't.

145
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,219
Scott: I've been watching any anime.

146
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:03,500
Rym: I've been watching a lot of anime.

147
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,597
Rym: I just watched Keio Century Beast again, and then I watched a couple episodes again, again.

148
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:19,076
Rym: I gotta say, sometimes- El Hazzard, I really like that show, but it was better when I was younger, and it doesn't stand up 100% to the test of time.

149
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,800
Scott: Even with Cat Armor?

150
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:23,820
Rym: It stands up, like, 80% to the test of time.

151
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,947
Rym: That is still a good show, in my opinion, but it doesn't stand up 100%.

152
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:29,500
Scott: Cat Armor?

153
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:30,620
Scott: It's damaged?

154
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,780
Rym: I don't know, the other- The Cat Armor, and the, uh- Alright, fine, 99%.

155
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,140
Rym: Bugram.

156
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:37,177
Rym: Bugram.

157
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,196
Rym: Just Gen-I.

158
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:40,940
Rym: Gen-I makes that show, as far as I'm concerned.

159
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,259
Rym: Not, uh- Ava, Ava, Zoot, Zoot.

160
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:46,339
Rym: Fine, everyone makes that show.

161
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,019
Rym: Except Makoto, he's kinda lame.

162
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:49,560
Rym: Kinda generic.

163
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:57,219
Scott: What's with the lame- You know, we could do a whole show on the, you know, problem of boring main character, exciting side character.

164
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,339
Rym: Yeah, I mean, Tenchi Muyo, everyone in that show was great.

165
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:02,180
Rym: Except Tenchi, he's just kinda there.

166
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,779
Scott: Except the whole show.

167
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,160
Rym: That show's awesome, you suck.

168
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,580
Rym: How could you like El Hazzard and not like Tenchi?

169
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,558
Rym: They're the same show.

170
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,105
Scott: Nah.

171
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:15,680
Rym: Anyway, but, uh, a while- Keio Century Beast is, like, the bomb, it stands up more.

172
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:23,559
Rym: Watching it now was better than when I watched it before because I know more about anime now, and I didn't realize how much of a parody show it was.

173
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:33,760
Rym: But, uh, also, Emily, way back, gave me a Nodame Cantabile, and I've been wanting to watch it for a while, and I just didn't, and she described a lot of, like, really funny scenes.

174
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,000
Scott: Isn't it just sort of like a romance and music show?

175
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,779
Rym: Uh, it's more like Initial D of piano players and violin players and timpani players.

176
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,475
Scott: Oh, okay.

177
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:48,380
Rym: It's much more Initial D than it is just romantic comedy.

178
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,260
Rym: It's much more comedy than it is romantic.

179
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:51,919
Rym: Uh-huh.

180
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,820
Rym: It's really, really good.

181
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,200
Scott: Well, it's super popular.

182
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,922
Scott: Like, the manga's going crazy, and the anime is another anime, so- But

183
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:09,220
Rym: a little reason why it's so good is that it's one of those shows where you expect, you know, you're watching, and just having watched a lot of anime or read a lot of manga, you expect it to go in a certain direction.

184
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:12,029
Rym: Like, "Oh, this is gonna be the love triangle, this is gonna be

185
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:12,273
Rym: that.".

186
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:24,020
Rym: And it always kind of either ups it a notch or kind of escalates it one degree beyond what you were expecting, or it just takes it to the straight face- like, the straight-up face value.

187
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:32,948
Rym: Like, "Oh, the foreign professor appears, but they didn't know he was the foreign professor who's famous, and they kicked him out because they thought he was a pervert because he acted like a pervert, but it must have just been a

188
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:33,736
Rym: misunderstanding.".

189
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,599
Rym: No, in this show, he is just a pervert.

190
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,218
Rym: Straight up.

191
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,960
Scott: So, wait, the foreign famous professor is a pervert?

192
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:42,364
Scott: Yes.

193
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,280
Rym: Well, no, first you think- They got me.

194
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,856
Rym: I thought, "Oh, it's gonna be a misunderstanding.

195
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:49,669
Rym: He's actually just, you know, German and weird, but he's not a

196
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:50,114
Rym: pervert.".

197
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:54,696
Rym: Then I was like, "Oh, it's this con artist who's a pervert pretending to be the

198
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:55,040
Rym: conductor.".

199
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:57,460
Rym: No, the conductor is just a pervert.

200
00:11:58,746 --> 00:11:59,320
Scott: That's pretty good.

201
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:12,530
Rym: And the other thing that might- You know, there's kind of a cliché where the main character is really neat and really cool and collected and awesome, and the kind of main girl character is a slob, and you think, "Oh, well, that's gonna be the romantic

202
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:12,914
Rym: comedy.".

203
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:25,297
Rym: The scene where he enters her apartment, it is dirty to the point of health hazard, and they make a big deal about that, and as a result, it's great.

204
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:26,700
Rym: I really like this show.

205
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Rym: I watched like eight episodes in the past day and a half.

206
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:30,739
Scott: I'm not watching any anime.

207
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,958
Scott: I'm not even reading comics.

208
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:34,140
Scott: I'm mostly working on computers and things.

209
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,400
Rym: Oh, that's just fantastic.

210
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:36,224
Scott: Yeah.

211
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:38,933
Scott: Well, shit's getting done, though, so- Gonna watch at least K.O.

212
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:40,535
Rym: Century Beasts and we can- Eventually.

213
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,700
Scott: Review that show, maybe- If you want shit to get done, then I'm putting the other things on hold.

214
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,664
Rym: Come on, K.O.

215
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:47,780
Rym: Century Beasts is like six episodes.

216
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,378
Scott: I got stuff to do.

217
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,190
Rym: Plus, I don't think you realize how Rock and- Oh, no.

218
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:53,679
Rym: Oh, no.

219
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,060
Rym: Rock and Roll Bomber?

220
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:55,878
Scott: Yeah, I know.

221
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:58,660
Scott: That's not something I don't know already.

222
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:02,387
Rym: I don't think you remember quite how important K.O.

223
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:02,859
Rym: Century Beasts is.

224
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,796
Scott: I think I remember all about Dr.

225
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:05,280
Scott: Password.

226
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,936
Rym: Doc-do-pass-wa.

227
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:08,359
Scott: Doc-do-pass-wa.

228
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:10,818
Rym: You need charm, pass-wa-do.

229
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:12,800
Scott: Okay.

230
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:17,698
Rym: Anyway, we should probably talk a little bit about the- Well, what anime news?

231
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,300
Scott: Well, yeah, there is no anime news because the anime industry is- And comics, not so much news going on either.

232
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,080
Rym: It's not cotton season, so we don't have anything about that yet.

233
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:41,080
Rym: Except, real quick, if you know someone or can think of someone who you think would be a good fit to present a panel or a talk or a lecture at ConnectiCon, which is an anime con- Hopefully, someone near Connecticut.

234
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,019
Rym: Okay, it's anime con, but also web- It's kind of more a general geek con.

235
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,099
Rym: We are taking submissions.

236
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:52,775
Scott: I'm getting that out there again because- Yeah, we're not taking submissions for like, "I'm just an anime fan

237
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:53,058
Scott: yet.".

238
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:59,639
Scott: We're looking for actual people, you know, at our level or higher, perhaps.

239
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,460
Rym: Like, if you know a professor who wants to talk about Miyazaki movies or something.

240
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:09,780
Scott: Or if you know a game designer who lives near, maybe in Boston or something.

241
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:13,620
Rym: Or you're that awesome, and you can convince us that you're that awesome.

242
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:15,500
Scott: Yeah, someone with a resume.

243
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,860
Scott: Maybe someone who's done panels before.

244
00:14:19,022 --> 00:14:19,940
Rym: I see what you- Anyway.

245
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,980
Rym: That's all I've got, so is there any news?

246
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:24,318
Scott: No, there's no news.

247
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,440
Scott: So I'm resorting to something we haven't done in forever.

248
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:28,839
Scott: The Geek Back.

249
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,362
Scott: Oh.

250
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:32,580
Scott: Oh, I got an email this morning, actually.

251
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,331
Scott: And it just so happens to be absolutely perfect.

252
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:36,140
Scott: Geek Back material.

253
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:42,560
Scott: I won't make him suffer by sharing his name, right?

254
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,660
Scott: But usually people, they like to ask us questions, right?

255
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:55,380
Scott: And quite often we get the question, "Hey, I used to watch this anime, or I saw this anime.

256
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,230
Scott: It was like this.

257
00:14:58,115 --> 00:14:58,678
Scott: What was

258
00:14:58,739 --> 00:14:58,779
Scott: it?".

259
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,539
Scott: You know, like someone will say, "Oh man, when I was a kid, I watched this thing.

260
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:05,160
Scott: It had these lions that combined and a sword.

261
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:05,591
Scott: What was

262
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:05,737
Scott: it?".

263
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,900
Scott: And I'll be like, "A Voltron," right?

264
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,140
Scott: But the thing is, they're never that easy.

265
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,816
Scott: It's always, "I saw one with a spaceship, and there was a captain who was

266
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:14,220
Scott: badass.".

267
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,639
Scott: I'll be like, "I don't know.

268
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,265
Scott: Harlock?

269
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:17,074
Scott: No, that wasn't

270
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:17,155
Scott: it.".

271
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:18,359
Rym: Macross?

272
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,139
Scott: Macross.

273
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,720
Scott: I mean, there's a hundred shows.

274
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:21,919
Scott: I can't help you.

275
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,860
Scott: And even if I name like 10 shows, they won't say, then none of them will ring a bell in their minds.

276
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:28,285
Scott: So people.

277
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:40,560
Scott: usually, they either don't have enough information to help you figure out what show it is, or it's not usually a question I like being asked.

278
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,858
Scott: But someone sent us an email this morning, and I'll read this email for you now, all right?

279
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:50,599
Scott: "Hey guys, love the show and could go on for hours about how awesome you are, but I need your help.

280
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:54,139
Scott: I was on my way to getting into anime, and I watched a movie I really loved.

281
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,339
Scott: The trouble is that I rented it just before I moved from the UK to the US.

282
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,660
Scott: I can't for the life of me remember what the name was.

283
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:06,416
Scott: I think you may have recommended it, but I have gone through all the getting people into anime episodes, including how to get people into anime, but I can't find

284
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:06,477
Scott: it.".

285
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:09,139
Rym: I'll just point out real quick that we did mention it in those.

286
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,959
Scott: So please, please, please, can you help me?

287
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,479
Scott: I don't know anyone who can help me out.

288
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,380
Scott: Here's the description.

289
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,980
Scott: Okay, wait, I'm going to stop right here for a second.

290
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,960
Scott: And this is something our Monday listeners have heard from me more, but I want to make sure all the listeners remember this message, right?

291
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,180
Scott: Don't ask me something because I don't know anything.

292
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,717
Scott: I am El Stupido, right?

293
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:34,840
Scott: You can ask me.

294
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,920
Rym: This is also El Stupido.

295
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,598
Rym: I know stuff.

296
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:37,169
Scott: Yeah.

297
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,760
Scott: Well, the only reason it seems like we know stuff is because we know one thing.

298
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,859
Scott: Well, I know two things.

299
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,900
Scott: There are two things I know.

300
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,800
Scott: Number one, if I don't know something, ask Wikipedia.

301
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,760
Scott: And number two, if I don't know something, ask Google.

302
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,880
Scott: Therefore, it appears as if I know everything when I know nothing, except to ask Google and Wikipedia.

303
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:11,079
Scott: Okay, so before wasting our time, please ask the Google or the Wikipedia because even if you, and I quote, "I don't know anyone who can help you out," there are things that can help you out.

304
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:17,936
Scott: Even in the olden days before computers, I would have said, "Please ask the library before bothering the

305
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:18,380
Scott: professor.".

306
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,839
Rym: See, I think we have slightly different ways of handling that because if someone asks me something that I would have to look up, I usually just don't answer.

307
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,260
Rym: So I only answer if I actually know something.

308
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,980
Scott: Oh, so you just don't even bother answering.

309
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:36,099
Scott: See, I'm trying to help them out by saying, "Look, if you just ask Google in the first...".

310
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,380
Scott: It's not trying to insult people or anything.

311
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,420
Scott: I'm actually trying to help them.

312
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:42,951
Scott: It's like, "Look, dude, you could save a lot of time and effort if you ask

313
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:43,358
Scott: Google.".

314
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,779
Scott: And that's all I'm going to do if you ask me.

315
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:47,660
Rym: Of course, at the same time...

316
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:49,940
Scott: I want people to get the information quickly and more efficiently.

317
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,980
Scott: That's why I'm telling it to them.

318
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:59,516
Rym: To this guy's credit, it's really difficult to search for a description of a show if you don't know names of characters.

319
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,395
Rym: It's kind of like, "All right, what's the song that goes kind of like

320
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:03,596
Rym: this?".

321
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:08,340
Rym: There's no website that will tell you that.

322
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:09,526
Scott: Yeah, there is.

323
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:13,140
Scott: There's two different iPhone applications and there are also websites that do it.

324
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,280
Rym: Yeah, they don't work that well.

325
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,600
Scott: They actually work really well.

326
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,438
Rym: Depends on the song.

327
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,200
Scott: If you go... I recall... It's going to get it right.

328
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:26,339
Rym: I recall that when you were showing this to me, I did just that.

329
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,335
Rym: And it recommended the wrong song.

330
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,279
Scott: Well, it worked for me.

331
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,518
Scott: I've tried it a few times.

332
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:33,359
Scott: We'll try it after the show.

333
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:39,780
Rym: I think the problem with that app and apps like that is that they work better the more you know the song.

334
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,899
Rym: And I think they really only work for people who already do know what the song was.

335
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,695
Scott: Yeah, but actually there's a lot of songs where I know it's like, "Oh, oh, that

336
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:49,060
Scott: song.".

337
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,399
Scott: But I have no idea who the musician or the name is.

338
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,879
Scott: Yeah, people should know who that one is.

339
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,740
Scott: Anyway, let me continue reading this email.

340
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,600
Rym: Okay, this is... I just want to say, this is precious.

341
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,440
Scott: If you're an anime fan, get ready to lol.

342
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:03,759
Scott: Sorry, dude.

343
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:05,280
Scott: Okay, ready?

344
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,420
Scott: A girl is in the car with her parents going to the new house.

345
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,359
Scott: They stop off at an abandoned amusement park.

346
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,340
Scott: She runs after a boy and gets sucked into a strange world.

347
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:15,420
Scott: The boy turns out to be a morphing dragon.

348
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:20,480
Scott: She gets to work in a surreal cleaning/bath place that services a multitude of creatures.

349
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:24,040
Scott: There's an old guy near the beginning who has spider-like arms and legs.

350
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,800
Scott: He operates these tablets that control all the water flows, types, soaps, temperatures.

351
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,520
Scott: He has little black ball creatures in his office, like the dark blobs in Zelda games, but good.

352
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,000
Scott: It's so much information.

353
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,260
Scott: Actually, the evil which runs the place looks a lot like most of the witches from Zelda.

354
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,740
Scott: Anyway, the human girl passes lots of trials held by some characters, hinted by others.

355
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,539
Scott: The flying long Japanese dragon boy becomes a friend, then an enemy, then a friend again.

356
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:52,040
Scott: I think he sacrifices himself for her to return to reality.

357
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,759
Scott: I hope that wasn't too long-winded.

358
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,740
Scott: I hope you know what I'm talking about, that I can find more similar anime.

359
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:58,700
Scott: Actually, I'd love some suggestions.

360
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,234
Scott: How could you get--.

361
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,958
Scott: Thanks so much, making nights go on.

362
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:09,960
Rym: How could you know that much about the show and not know the name of any character or-- And, I mean, it wouldn't be so bad.

363
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:22,795
Scott: I mean, if someone came up to me and was like, "Dude, when I was a kid, there was a show, and there was a ship in outer space, but it looked like a pirate ship, and the captain was a pirate, and it was just all piratey and cool, but with space lasers, you

364
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:22,917
Scott: know?"

365
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:26,838
Scott: I could say, "All right, it's Captain Harlock, and you might not remember Harlock,

366
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:27,000
Scott: right?".

367
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,412
Scott: And then I'd say,

368
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:27,680
Scott: "Harlock.".

369
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,150
Scott: I'd be like, "Oh,

370
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:28,560
Scott: yeah.".

371
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,840
Scott: I don't know, I'm using it as an example so much, but whatever.

372
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:38,580
Scott: But something you just saw and you remember in such detail and is such a huge show.

373
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:47,240
Scott: I mean, I emailed him back, and I tried not to insult him too much, but I was like, "Dude, what you just asked me is sort of like saying, 'Hey, do you remember this movie?

374
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:56,839
Scott: There's a guy in a black suit who has trouble breathing, and there's laser swords, and the spaceships are shaped like X's, and there's a robot that can only talk in beeps.

375
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,320
Scott: I forget what the hell it's called, though.

376
00:20:58,643 --> 00:20:58,905
Scott: What is

377
00:20:58,946 --> 00:20:59,148
Scott: that?".

378
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,440
Rym: There's a lot of ambassadors.

379
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:09,520
Scott: Yeah, there's ambassadors, and all the soldiers have this white plastic armor, and there's a big ball in space with a laser coming out of it.

380
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:15,073
Rym: Oh, and they're looking for these droids, but they're not the droids they're looking for, and there's a big fat guy, and I don't know what happens to him, but...

381
00:21:16,063 --> 00:21:17,033
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

382
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:17,699
Scott: What show was that?

383
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,440
Rym: Well, at least I can answer this dude's question.

384
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,039
Rym: The show you were looking for is called Erodesukidouji.

385
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:29,979
Rym: It's a real hit with the ladies.

386
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,596
Scott: I don't know if we should actually... Eh, why not?

387
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,949
Scott: The show is obviously, for any anime fan out there knows, it's Spirited Away, a.k.a.

388
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,540
Scott: Sentou Chihiro.

389
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,380
Scott: Yes, it won an Oscar.

390
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:45,839
Scott: You may have heard of it.

391
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:47,176
Scott: By Miyazaki.

392
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:53,420
Rym: That movie is seriously... I think it's in my top 10 or 15 movies of all time.

393
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,939
Scott: It's my number two Ghibli movie, after El Porco Rosso.

394
00:21:57,987 --> 00:22:00,112
Rym: See, the problem is, if I look at my top 15 or 20 movies...

395
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,116
Scott: My lowest Ghibli movie, even though it's still great in its way, is Pompoko.

396
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:07,255
Rym: Pompoko.

397
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,697
Rym: I highly recommend that everyone out there see Pompoko.

398
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,000
Scott: Yes, especially if you're not Japanese.

399
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:14,599
Scott: It'll be much weirder for you.

400
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,199
Rym: Yes, however, I will say this.

401
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:23,200
Rym: After you see Pompoko, go online and read about Tanuki, and then it'll make a little more sense.

402
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,499
Scott: Mario 3 will help you also.

403
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:29,619
Rym: No, because in Mario 3, they don't have quite the same powers.

404
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,119
Scott: The golden orbs.

405
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:39,520
Rym: Right, so I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, but this is the only thing on Anime News Network worth talking about.

406
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:53,020
Scott: Oh yeah, but in case anyone didn't know, if a movie is directed or... If Hayao Miyazaki is involved in something in any way, or if it has Studio Ghibli label on it anywhere, you should probably watch it or read it or whatever.

407
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,494
Scott: You know, you can't lose.

408
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,920
Rym: So Funimation sued this company over selling bootleg anime.

409
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,806
Scott: Really?

410
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:04,579
Scott: Wow, good job.

411
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:11,100
Rym: Now the thing is, it amazes me that this is such a big problem with anime, like more so than everything else.

412
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,940
Rym: I mean, I'm not talking about piracy.

413
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,639
Rym: We're not in any way going to talk about fansubs, or piracy, or copyright infringement or any of that.

414
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:25,800
Rym: I'm talking about out of the blue, straight up, no bones about it bootlegging.

415
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:35,519
Scott: Yeah, I mean, when people bootleg Hollywood movies, they usually sell them on a blanket on the street or something like that.

416
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,440
Scott: They don't sell them in stores, really, or online.

417
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,559
Rym: Or even more than that.

418
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:48,720
Rym: While people, I see bootlegs of movies being sold, primarily, you only see them in kind of the dark undermarket.

419
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,500
Rym: You don't see them in retail spaces.

420
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,080
Rym: You don't see them in the real world, in real stores.

421
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,440
Rym: You see them from shady people on street corners.

422
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,400
Rym: You see them in crowded metropolises like on the corner.

423
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:01,940
Rym: You see them in like garage sales.

424
00:24:02,562 --> 00:24:07,560
Rym: You see them online, but you don't see them anywhere else, nowhere legitimate, except with anime.

425
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:16,340
Rym: I can't tell you how many times I've gone into a real brick and mortar store and seen nothing but bootleg anime and bootleg anime merchandise.

426
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:27,640
Rym: And I mean like, I'm talking so obvious that the cover is a black and white xerox taped to a case, and inside is a burned DVD.

427
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,900
Scott: I mean, to end up with a bootleg real Hollywood movie, right, you have to go to a slight underworld situation.

428
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:41,060
Scott: You either have to buy something from a shady website or on eBay, or you have to buy something off the street corner in Chinatown.

429
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:48,720
Rym: Or at the very least, there's occasionally the injection of mob copies or Chinese copies into legitimate streams of market stuff.

430
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,460
Scott: But never to like Best Buy or anything, or Amazon.

431
00:24:51,800 --> 00:25:02,838
Rym: Even if those things occasionally get into places like Best Buy, but they come through legitimate channels because someone along the way was corrupt, and even then, at least they look like legitimate pieces, like there's no way to tell.

432
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:06,340
Rym: But these things are pathetic.

433
00:25:06,824 --> 00:25:08,520
Rym: And it's not even just like it's in the cities.

434
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:14,959
Rym: Here in Beacon, actually up the road, in the mall, a new anime store opened like two years ago.

435
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,360
Scott: I don't know if it's there still, because you haven't been up there in a zillion years.

436
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,140
Rym: But the guy sold straight up bootlegs, nothing but bootlegs.

437
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,880
Rym: He just had bootleg anime for sale, box sets for like ten bucks.

438
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:36,267
Scott: I mean, there was another anime store, the older anime store, at least the bootlegs they sold were like old, old, old school robot shows that no one was carrying.

439
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,419
Scott: So it's sort of justified in a way.

440
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:44,839
Scott: But this place is selling like Naruto and Dragon Ball and Gundam bootlegs.

441
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,996
Rym: So I remember I went up to the guy and I was like, "Is this a legitimate North American

442
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:51,419
Rym: release?".

443
00:25:52,206 --> 00:25:52,649
Rym: And he said,

444
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,033
Rym: "Yeah.".

445
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:55,428
Rym: And I said, "Are you

446
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,112
Rym: sure?".

447
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,870
Rym: And he said, "Man, don't hassle me.

448
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,899
Rym: I can't make any money unless I sell this

449
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:02,140
Rym: shit.".

450
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:06,775
Scott: "Then you can't make any money legally.

451
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:07,678
Scott: Go out of

452
00:26:07,718 --> 00:26:08,159
Scott: business.".

453
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:21,439
Rym: But it seems like, of all media out there, piracy aside, anime gets bootlegged way more than everything else, like in terms of percentage of total sales.

454
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:38,440
Scott: I mean, actually, if you go to like Midtown Comics, which is like one of the biggest comic stores there is in New York City, they will sell bootleg DVDs there, but it's mostly old TV shows that haven't been released professionally yet.

455
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:42,719
Scott: Like, before Greatest American Hero was on real DVD, they were selling box sets.

456
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:46,540
Scott: They were selling Thundercats boxes before Thundercats came out.

457
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,520
Scott: They were selling DVDs of Family Guy movie before it was on DVD and stuff like that.

458
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,339
Scott: But as soon as it comes out, they cut it.

459
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,220
Rym: Ah, the Family Guy movie.

460
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,539
Rym: We watched that, what, like two months before it came out?

461
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:13,060
Scott: Yeah, but then as soon as stuff really comes out, they stop selling it, but they got all sorts of like, you can just go and buy like GI Joe there on DVD and all that sort of stuff, and it's all animation, basically, that gets bootlegged.

462
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:26,140
Scott: At anime conventions, people know and they don't let the dealers sell the bootlegs, but at a comic convention, people get away with it, because the people running that don't recognize the bootlegs or care as much.

463
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:33,760
Rym: Well, part of it is that the average anime con has a decent presence of anime dealers, and they kind of self-police because they don't want to get in trouble.

464
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,924
Scott: And also the convention.

465
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:38,120
Scott: people actually know bootlegs exist and can recognize them.

466
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,320
Rym: And the industry is there more.

467
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:57,240
Rym: Like, most comic conventions that aren't the really big ones are nothing but the shady dealers all like having a shady dealer con, and they have the legitimate one dollar comics, and then all the other people there who aren't competing with the comic dealers, so no one cares about them, are selling the straight-up bootlegs of movies.

468
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,090
Scott: Yep.

469
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,980
Rym: Of course, at least the New York Comic Con does not have that.

470
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:15,820
Rym: Last year, there was one booth selling the most bootleg of bootlegs, and I reported that dude, as did apparently everyone else at the con, because he disappeared the next day, and there was nothing like that at the next New York Comic Con.

471
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,880
Scott: Yeah, even though Midtown Comics, it provides all like bags for the con and stuff, sells them in their store.

472
00:28:22,063 --> 00:28:47,776
Scott: But I just think that it's interesting that, you know, a lot of people are blaming fansubs and whatnot for things, when really, one of the major things that hurt the anime industry is that they mostly relied on selling DVDs, and people were buying DVDs, lots of people, but the market and the situation of bootlegs was such that people who actually would have and did buy real DVDs ended up buying bootlegs.

473
00:28:48,402 --> 00:28:49,067
Rym: They're not cheap.

474
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,900
Rym: They cost almost as much as the real ones.

475
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,090
Scott: Well, they're cheaper, you know.

476
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,120
Scott: A lot of times, it's like a ludicrous number of episodes in a box for like 20 bucks.

477
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,957
Rym: But even then, like that store, that guy was selling the box sets for 50, 60 bucks still.

478
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,160
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

479
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:11,380
Scott: And I mean, you know, I always say, someone who downloads fansubs instead of buying, if fansubs were not an option, they just wouldn't have watched it.

480
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,920
Scott: So the fansub doesn't subtract a sale.

481
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,740
Scott: A bootleg actually does subtract a sale.

482
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:23,260
Scott: Someone who would have bought it ended up buying something, and the money went to some Chinese mafia instead of going to the real company.

483
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:35,660
Scott: And we have a situation where people who don't know better, which is seemingly most people, like regular old anime fans who mean well, will buy bootlegs unknowingly.

484
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,520
Scott: I mean, even my sister bought a bootleg not knowing it, you know.

485
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,980
Scott: And it's not even in a black marketplace.

486
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:45,860
Scott: It's in, out, and about where regular people can get it.

487
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,540
Scott: You can go on Amazon and find people selling anime bootlegs, and Amazon doesn't know any better.

488
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,120
Scott: They can stop regular movie bootlegs because they know better, but not anime ones.

489
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,860
Rym: So I don't want to belabor the point.

490
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,760
Rym: I want to get on to the much more important thing we're talking about tonight.

491
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:15,980
Rym: But I will say this, because Funimation is completely right in this regard, and I urge all of you out there, if you care about anime, when you see, in legitimate places, if you see bootleg anime, like actual bootleg anime for sale, confront the people.

492
00:30:16,502 --> 00:30:21,919
Rym: Confront the stores, and if they balk or they won't do anything, like if it's in a mall, report them to the mall.

493
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:28,359
Rym: And report them to Funimation, because Funimation has at least one testicle, because they're going after these people now.

494
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,180
Scott: Yeah, report to whoever it can be reported to.

495
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,920
Scott: Like if you see, like there's a lot of stores that sell stuff on Amazon, but it's actually a different store and not Amazon itself.

496
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:47,175
Scott: If you see a store selling, if you like search for an anime DVD on Amazon, and you find a bootleg, call up Amazon and tell them, you know, or email Amazon and tell them, "Hey, this store is selling bootleg merchandise through

497
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:47,598
Scott: Amazon.".

498
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:49,939
Scott: They will shut that shit down right away.

499
00:30:50,521 --> 00:31:04,140
Rym: But if you really want to have fun, instead of reporting to anyone, like in a mall or something, get all your friends together, and make little flyers and stuff, and have a little protest around the store, and you'll guaranteed get the local news.

500
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:12,780
Rym: And then a local news guy will come up and ask you what you're doing, and then you'll get to tell him, and you'll be on the evening news, and you'll basically put the bootlegger out of business handily.

501
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:15,559
Scott: Well, maybe not the bootlegger, but the bootleg distributor.

502
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,420
Rym: The bootleg distributor.

503
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:17,939
Scott: Yeah, the retailer guy.

504
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,436
Scott: Yeah.

505
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,400
Scott: Who knows if you'll actually get the bootlegger behind it, unless there's some investigations going on.

506
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,599
Rym: Well, the bootlegger behind it, from what I've seen...

507
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:25,939
Scott: Is always the Chinese mafia.

508
00:31:26,461 --> 00:31:30,834
Rym: Like we have this bootleg copy of Planet S, and the subtitles, they're fine.

509
00:31:30,874 --> 00:31:31,660
Rym: on the first episode.

510
00:31:31,921 --> 00:31:33,439
Scott: We didn't buy it, just so people know.

511
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:34,740
Rym: We acquired it.

512
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,480
Scott: It was free from someone else, from someone else, you know how it is.

513
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:44,259
Rym: The second episode, the subtitles trailed off into Cyrillic, about halfway through, and by the third episode, it was just gibberish.

514
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:45,058
Scott: Yeah.

515
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,499
Rym: For the whole rest of the show.

516
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:47,909
Rym: It's like, what?

517
00:31:48,396 --> 00:31:48,660
Rym: Great.

518
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:56,330
Rym: Things of the Day.

519
00:31:56,951 --> 00:32:05,450
Rym: You know it's a Wednesday when I cop out and either show a Hokuto no Ken-related thing of the day, or an old anime music video that time forgot.

520
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,750
Rym: I've got for you an old anime music video that time forgot.

521
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,489
Rym: It's also one of my favorite anime music videos, and I think everyone should see it.

522
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:20,090
Rym: It's called Failed Experiments in Video Editing, and it's Topapa Loves Mambo, and it's priceless.

523
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:22,696
Scott: Okay.

524
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:41,889
Rym: The thing is though, it basically makes fun of making music videos, and someone we know made an anime music video to one of the songs that this music video makes fun of making music videos to, but he did it in a non-ironic, totally serious manner, and basically this video preemptively owned him.

525
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:44,550
Rym: It was kind of awful.

526
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:48,028
Rym: We thought his video was a joke until it ended, and then we realized it wasn't.

527
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:51,410
Rym: So what do you got for me?

528
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,989
Scott: I was going to say this for Tuesday, but it's all I got right now.

529
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,650
Scott: There's a guy named Jordan Mechner.

530
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,234
Scott: Mechner?

531
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:58,670
Scott: I don't know how to pronounce it, sorry.

532
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:03,189
Scott: He's sort of famous, you know, invented Prince of Persia, and some other things you may have heard of.

533
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:07,530
Scott: And he posted this video on his website, well on Vimeo and then on his website.

534
00:33:08,414 --> 00:33:15,470
Scott: It's a video he took in 1985 of his brother, his younger, or I assume younger brother, David Mechner, right?

535
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:30,630
Scott: And his brother was sort of wearing loose Prince of Persia-ish clothing, running and jumping and climbing and such, and he took this video footage and from that made, you know, the animations for the original Prince of Persia.

536
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:39,210
Scott: And if you've ever played the original Prince of Persia, even though it was made in like the '80s and is wicked old, the Prince actually looks or he moves scarily real.

537
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,547
Scott: And you watch these videos and you're like, holy shit, the Prince moves just like that dude.

538
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:48,870
Scott: And it's, you know, if you played Prince of Persia, then this video will freak you out.

539
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:53,159
Scott: And if you haven't, watch this video and then play Prince of Persia and they'll freak you out.

540
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:54,350
Scott: That's how it's supposed to be.

541
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,383
Scott: And it's just cool that it's sort of an important artifact, like this has come out, you know, 13 years later.

542
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,649
Rym: So shall we get on with it?

543
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,105
Scott: Yes.

544
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,010
Rym: Tonight we're talking about a fantastic comic.

545
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:16,429
Rym: One that not as many Americans have probably read as should have, but luckily the rest of the world respects the ducks.

546
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:23,870
Scott: Mostly the Northern Europe, such as Finland, also the Norway, Sweden, Denmark, maybe areas.

547
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,449
Scott: You know, that part of the world is super crazy about these comics.

548
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,467
Scott: Super crazy.

549
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,630
Scott: Like I think it gets more subscriptions than like anything.

550
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:43,730
Scott: Anyway, we're obviously talking about the comics of Disney's ducks, mostly Scrooge, but also Donald and the kids and whatnot.

551
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:50,690
Rym: I could see us doing a show on the whole duck universe or like a show on the ducks in general, but we're not really talking about the universe.

552
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:55,969
Rym: We're talking about two very specific sets of comics that you can buy easily and read.

553
00:34:56,351 --> 00:34:58,450
Scott: Yes, very easily on Amazon for wicked cheap.

554
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,750
Scott: I mean, the cover price is $17, so the real price is gonna be way less than that.

555
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:06,730
Rym: And this is totally worth it, but we were talking about the life and times of Scrooge McDuck.

556
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,550
Scott: Yes, let me explain the situation here, right?

557
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,210
Scott: Way back in the day, there was a Disney artist named Carl Barks.

558
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,983
Scott: Way back, way back in the day, right?

559
00:35:16,023 --> 00:35:16,687
Scott: Like the 40s.

560
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:26,228
Scott: And, you know, you ever wonder why it is that, you know, there's Mickey, Minnie, and Pluto, and then there's Goofy who's sort of on his own over there, right?

561
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:35,670
Scott: And, like, they don't really have a cast of characters about them, but when it comes to, like, Donald, it's like Donald and Daisy and the nephews and Scrooge.

562
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:42,230
Scott: and, like, they had a whole show, DuckTales, this million, this Gyro Gearloose, and, like, all these ducktails.

563
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:45,250
Scott: There's all these freaking characters all over the place.

564
00:35:45,351 --> 00:36:14,010
Scott: And the reason for that is 'cause way back in the day when, you know, times were tough, Carl Barks went and he sort of took, you know, the ducks of Disney and expanded that whole universe and created all these comic books, you know, out of, you know, pretty much Donald Duck, which I think is, you know, the character is created by Walt Disney, but, you know, Scrooge and Gladstone Gardner and the Beagle Boys and Glomgold and Magic of the Spell, that was all created by Carl Barks in comic books.

565
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:16,829
Scott: Scrooge McDuck was in a comic book before he was ever anywhere else.

566
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:23,429
Scott: And Carl Barks died, I think, in 2000, according to Wikipedia at least.

567
00:36:24,154 --> 00:36:31,650
Scott: And there's another guy named Don Rosa, and Don Rosa is sort of like the, you know, guy who has carried on the torch of Carl Barks.

568
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:38,788
Scott: And according to him, any duck comic written by Carl Barks is canon and all others are apocryphal.

569
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:40,229
Rym: Right?

570
00:36:41,256 --> 00:36:42,006
Scott: And I'll buy that.

571
00:36:42,812 --> 00:36:52,750
Scott: And basically what he did is he went back and he looked at all these old Uncle Scrooge comics and all the old Uncle Scrooge comics of Carl Barks are sort of like DuckTales episodes, you know.

572
00:36:53,514 --> 00:37:04,889
Scott: Oh, you know, Scrooge McDuck is having, you know, Beagle Boys is trying to steal the money from the Money Bin and then using some crazy plot of like a drill through the ground and Scrooge McDuck stops and, you know.

573
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,510
Rym: And remember, Scrooge McDuck was a kind of throwaway character in the Donald Duck universe.

574
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:15,010
Scott: Yeah, he was a, you know, he was a side character that sort of came on in and sort of became more prominent and whatnot.

575
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,710
Rym: To the point where Scrooge McDuck is arguably more popular than Donald.

576
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:19,516
Rym: Perhaps.

577
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,001
Scott: Perhaps.

578
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:20,710
Scott: He's definitely cooler.

579
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:30,970
Rym: Of course, I got to admit, the Donald in these books is a lot more aloof and I like him a lot more than the Donald I've seen in most Disney cartoons.

580
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:35,786
Scott: Yeah, I mean, even Math Magic Land Donald is not so cool compared to this Donald.

581
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:36,130
Scott: Anyway.

582
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:40,075
Rym: This Donald is much more kind of arrogant and, well anyway, we're not talking about Donald.

583
00:37:40,276 --> 00:37:42,950
Rym: We're talking about his far superior relative, Scrooge.

584
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,471
Scott: Yes.

585
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:50,170
Scott: So, what happened was, is you would read all these old Carl Barks, you know, Scrooge McDuck comics.

586
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,060
Scott: And Scrooge McDuck would always say something like, "Ah, this isn't tough.

587
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,009
Scott: When I was in the Yukon, such and such and

588
00:37:56,029 --> 00:37:56,130
Scott: such.".

589
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:02,628
Scott: Sort of like, you know, an old man says, "Ah, you know, walk, you know, I've walked 15 miles in the snow to get

590
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:02,910
Scott: right.".

591
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,929
Rym: That time I had met Teddy Roosevelt and then I stole something.

592
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:06,893
Scott: Right, right.

593
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:07,497
Scott: Exactly.

594
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:12,930
Scott: So, what Don Rosa did, you know, because Don, basically Scrooge McDuck, there's a comic you can buy.

595
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:13,856
Scott: It comes out every month.

596
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,690
Scott: Scrooge McDuck comics, number whatever.

597
00:38:16,012 --> 00:38:17,338
Scott: And it kept going and going and going.

598
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:19,549
Scott: And for a time, Don Rosa was writing it.

599
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:28,730
Scott: And he decided that from issue something to something, I forget the exact issue numbers, he was going to write the life and times of Scrooge McDuck.

600
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,191
Scott: Oh, here it is.

601
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:34,130
Scott: Uncle Scrooge, 285, 286, all the way up through 296.

602
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:34,270
Scott: Right.

603
00:38:35,514 --> 00:39:05,369
Scott: If you, and what he did is he took all those things that Scrooge McDuck said and all of the canon material in the Scrooge McDuck comics that were written by Carl Barks and he said, and he filled in the blanks between when Scrooge McDuck was born up until he had the money bin, thereby making a consistent story of Scrooge McDuck's life, you know, instead of just, you know, an old man with a money bin and talking about the olden days and who knows what the olden days really were like.

604
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:21,349
Rym: Thus, effectively what the life and times of Scrooge McDuck is, is one of the most massive, most masterful, most perfectly consistent put together and well executed effort of retro continuity the world has ever seen.

605
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:27,629
Rym: Because I usually understand how many quote unquote Barksian facts there are.

606
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,276
Scott: Lots and lots of Barksian facts.

607
00:39:30,296 --> 00:40:00,890
Scott: So much that in between each and every issue in this book, right, there are two or three pages explaining in great detail, like exactly why, you know, you know, how he could tell that this is what happened in Scrooge McDuck's life because of these things that he talked about in some Barks comic and, you know, how, you know, the reason Scrooge said this on this page is because, you know, he said this in, you know, Uncle Scrooge comics number three or number 50 or something like that.

608
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:13,670
Scott: And his pages and pages and pages of all this information, unlike, you know, because Marvel and DC Comics tried to do the same thing, same thing, too, with this consistent universe of perfect continuity of, you know, everything is canon.

609
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,290
Scott: But they always doofus it up.

610
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,279
Scott: They always doofus it up.

611
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,189
Scott: They always have to retcon.

612
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:26,210
Scott: They always have to like kill everyone in the universe and then bring everyone back or say, oh, no, there are multiple universes or, you know, oh, actually, no, that didn't happen.

613
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:31,610
Scott: That was a dream or, yeah, someone who with wicked, wicked, powerful magic undid that.

614
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:33,969
Scott: And this is what actually happened now.

615
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,692
Rym: But not here.

616
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:41,050
Rym: Rosa was able to get almost everything in, in a consistent manner.

617
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:50,730
Scott: He basically contradicted Barks zero times and just ignored anyone who wasn't Carl Barks because, you know, everyone who isn't Carl Barks or Don Rosa doesn't mean anything.

618
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:57,489
Rym: And the few times he like pointedly left something out or the few times he was vague about something because there's no way to resolve it.

619
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,250
Scott: He makes a note and an excuse or a justification.

620
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,550
Rym: The justifications are agonizing.

621
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:08,229
Rym: This was a labor of love, the likes of which you don't see that often.

622
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,566
Scott: The likes of which you don't see any, I don't know, anything else.

623
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:12,150
Scott: that is quite.

624
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:21,470
Rym: I would say that it is the work done here in making the life and times of Scrooge McDuck is on the level of Tezuka's dedication to comics.

625
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:23,318
Scott: Yeah, yeah, definitely.

626
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,150
Scott: I mean, I guess they weren't as prolific as Tezuka.

627
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,964
Scott: But I mean, if you're talking about, you know, the the I mean, this.

628
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:31,449
Scott: this is written as if.

629
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:32,233
Scott: Right.

630
00:41:32,475 --> 00:41:34,950
Scott: Someone studied like actual history.

631
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:35,572
Scott: Right.

632
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:42,008
Scott: Like let's say I studied Roman history and then made a comic that did not contradict known Roman history in any way.

633
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:44,070
Scott: Being told the story of Caesar's life.

634
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,297
Scott: That's basically what this is.

635
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:47,610
Scott: Only instead of Caesar, it's Scrooge.

636
00:41:47,891 --> 00:41:56,670
Rym: And also if there were a thousand times the greater the volume of information about Caesar's life and some of it was a little bit contradictory and you had to figure it out.

637
00:41:56,951 --> 00:42:01,370
Rym: He basically did archaeology into a comic book written by someone he liked.

638
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,156
Scott: And it doesn't.

639
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:07,690
Scott: usually when someone tries to do some retro continuity stuff, it always.

640
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:12,110
Scott: there's always something ham fisted or something that doesn't quite fit or something doesn't make sense.

641
00:42:12,612 --> 00:42:19,430
Scott: But no, if you read this and completely skip all the pages that give you the background information, it totally makes sense.

642
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:25,450
Scott: It's a totally consistent and straightforward, continuous story with no self contradictions whatsoever.

643
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,510
Scott: And if you made like this into a movie, it would be awesome and make perfect sense.

644
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:31,414
Scott: And no one would question it.

645
00:42:31,555 --> 00:42:34,530
Rym: And oh, my God, I want to see a movie of this too late.

646
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:37,328
Scott: Well, I mean, not too late, but I doubt it's going to happen.

647
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:39,515
Rym: See, it always bothers me.

648
00:42:39,535 --> 00:42:43,950
Rym: It's like Disney keeps going in all these directions that are well and good.

649
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:49,450
Rym: But every time they strike gold, at least gold, as far as I'm concerned, they never follow up.

650
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:53,227
Rym: I mean, Disney Afternoon, I still like all those cartoons.

651
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:53,970
Rym: I think they're amazing.

652
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,100
Scott: Yeah, Darkwing Duck, Tailspin.

653
00:42:56,602 --> 00:42:58,450
Scott: Oh, yeah, I don't like Rescue Rangers.

654
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,819
Rym: Oh, Rescue Rangers was great.

655
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:00,868
Scott: And also it was OK.

656
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:04,430
Rym: At least admit that the Rescue Rangers NES game was pretty damn good.

657
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,659
Scott: That was a good game.

658
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,909
Rym: I want to play that game right now.

659
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,394
Scott: That's a good game anyway.

660
00:43:08,835 --> 00:43:13,410
Rym: But the ducks or even like the Mickey Mouse cartoons and things, I love that stuff.

661
00:43:13,832 --> 00:43:16,730
Scott: When was the last actual Mickey Mouse cartoon, Prince and the Pauper?

662
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:18,796
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

663
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:20,250
Scott: Mickey and the Beanstalk is the business.

664
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:28,030
Scott: But they keep making like, you know, like every summer they make something completely new or, you know, they- Aladdin 19 Direct 2.

665
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:35,150
Scott: For all the Disney OAVs, they're always making like Aladdin 30 or, you know, what's it, Sleeping Beauty 5 or some bullshit like that, right?

666
00:43:35,711 --> 00:43:40,350
Scott: Why don't you make some fucking Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck or Scrooge McDuck cartoons?

667
00:43:40,511 --> 00:43:42,119
Scott: I mean, DuckTales was huge.

668
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,586
Scott: What's been that huge since?

669
00:43:43,606 --> 00:43:44,028
Scott: Nothing.

670
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:45,996
Rym: There was a DuckTales movie.

671
00:43:46,016 --> 00:43:46,439
Rym: You know what?

672
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,630
Rym: As far as I recall, it was pretty damn good.

673
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:49,534
Scott: It was damn good.

674
00:43:49,815 --> 00:43:52,610
Scott: It was also, you know, why don't they just do DuckTales again?

675
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,509
Rym: Yeah, I'd watch it now.

676
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:56,328
Scott: I don't see why not.

677
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,340
Rym: Oh, my God.

678
00:43:57,747 --> 00:43:57,970
Scott: All right.

679
00:43:58,473 --> 00:43:59,790
Scott: Let's talk about this comic here.

680
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:05,570
Rym: So before we get any further, if you couldn't tell, but I want to say this in no uncertain terms in case you don't make it to the end of the episode.

681
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:10,530
Rym: I know some people have like the 50 minute commute and then they always miss like the last little bit of the episode.

682
00:44:11,971 --> 00:44:16,350
Rym: The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck is a fantastic top 10 comic.

683
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,890
Scott: It's a must read for all human beings.

684
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:21,641
Rym: There is no one I would not recommend this to.

685
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:23,590
Rym: This is an absolutely amazing comic.

686
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,050
Scott: Whether you are zero or whether you're going to, you're 99, it doesn't matter.

687
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,948
Rym: I can't express it.

688
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:30,050
Scott: I guess if you're 100, nah, if you're 100, still good.

689
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:37,790
Rym: I mean, I honestly this is right up there in terms of my enjoyment with Sanctuary and Eagle and all that business.

690
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:39,710
Scott: I mean, it doesn't hurt, right?

691
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:47,050
Scott: Not only is it this amazing sort of, you know, history, continuity, you know, like amazing piece of work in that regard.

692
00:44:47,892 --> 00:44:50,270
Scott: The artwork is also amazing.

693
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:57,570
Scott: I mean, you know, usually if someone does like a comic book of something, you know, it doesn't look like the full production value.

694
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:03,190
Scott: Or you wouldn't expect like the Scrooge McDuck comic to have the same super production value of like the DuckTales movie.

695
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:08,490
Scott: But really, this looked better than any DuckTales movie, maybe because it didn't have to be animated.

696
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:11,510
Scott: But, you know, Carl Barks was a Disney animator.

697
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:14,569
Scott: This is, you know, this is good God.

698
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:22,010
Rym: Now, the story, if you didn't know, it basically just follows Scrooge McDuck from his childhood.

699
00:45:22,712 --> 00:45:35,950
Rym: And also, you know, from his childhood, it also has kind of the prologue knowledge of his family going all the way back to like 400 A.D The best is you look in here and there's actually a page that has the Donald Duck family tree.

700
00:45:36,793 --> 00:45:38,270
Scott: And it makes perfect sense.

701
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:43,090
Scott: The one thing is Huey, Dewey and Louie's dad is like, you know, covered by a branch.

702
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,308
Scott: There's like a bird in the way with a question mark.

703
00:45:45,936 --> 00:45:46,530
Rym: Oh, real quick.

704
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:49,269
Rym: I wonder if anyone out there, don't she don't look it up.

705
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,489
Rym: What are Huey, Dewey and Louie's names?

706
00:45:52,357 --> 00:45:52,669
Rym: Kids.

707
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:54,330
Scott: Huey, Dewey and Louie?

708
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:54,634
Scott: No.

709
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:59,010
Rym: Well, those are their nicknames, but Hubert, Deuteronomy and Lewis.

710
00:45:59,640 --> 00:45:59,810
Scott: Yeah.

711
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,230
Scott: Yeah.

712
00:46:01,277 --> 00:46:03,110
Rym: I don't think anyone remembers Deuteronomy.

713
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:03,574
Scott: No.

714
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:07,350
Rym: And if you don't know their last name, well, I really feel bad for you.

715
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:08,189
Scott: You're stupid.

716
00:46:09,371 --> 00:46:10,376
Rym: Kind of like.

717
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:11,703
Rym: where is Dr.

718
00:46:11,763 --> 00:46:12,789
Rym: McNinja's family from?

719
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:15,550
Scott: I mean, Scrooge is Donald's uncle.

720
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:20,090
Scott: You know, Scrooge's sister Hortense married Quackmore and their son was Donald.

721
00:46:20,555 --> 00:46:21,810
Scott: And their daughter was Della.

722
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,589
Scott: And Della is Huey, Dewey and Louie's mom.

723
00:46:24,132 --> 00:46:26,050
Scott: And everything fits together perfectly.

724
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:34,050
Rym: Man, you know, before straight up review, I just got to say, like, if you are a fan of these things at all, but you haven't really like, you don't know a lot about it.

725
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,049
Rym: You know who Donald Duck is.

726
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,730
Rym: You've seen Donald Duck cartoons, but you've never read like these comics.

727
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:45,128
Rym: Donald Duck's character will make a lot more sense to you when you see what Hortense and Quackmore were like.

728
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:45,870
Scott: Yeah.

729
00:46:46,992 --> 00:46:47,076
Rym: Yeah.

730
00:46:49,013 --> 00:46:50,510
Scott: But in addition to that, right.

731
00:46:51,151 --> 00:46:58,790
Scott: I think the best thing about these comics is it sort of, you know, first of all, it explains, you know, how Scrooge McDuck filled up this money bin.

732
00:46:59,384 --> 00:46:59,510
Scott: Right.

733
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,769
Scott: Which a lot of people, you know.

734
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,069
Rym: And you pretty much get like every bit of money that goes in there.

735
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:04,648
Scott: Yeah.

736
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:08,910
Scott: But you also, you know, Scrooge McDuck is sort of viewed in two ways.

737
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:12,023
Scott: Either he's sort of, you know, most people know him either.

738
00:47:12,284 --> 00:47:16,870
Scott: as from that, you know, Disney Christmas Carol, where he's Scrooge, the actual Scrooge.

739
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:21,570
Scott: You know, he's a miserly, grumpy old man who grubs money and he's whatnot.

740
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,549
Scott: And he is, you know, quite a bit.

741
00:47:24,071 --> 00:47:32,269
Scott: But he's also, you know, sort of like the adventuring around the world, you know, kind of guy sort of like with a safari hat on.

742
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:34,410
Scott: But he's still got a whole bunch of money.

743
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:38,930
Scott: But, you know, he's, you know, zipping around the world doing all sorts of crazy things trying to get more money.

744
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,050
Rym: Now, the cool thing is they both fit into the continuity perfectly.

745
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:42,460
Rym: Yep.

746
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:50,627
Scott: But people don't, you know, they don't realize that Scrooge McDuck isn't really mean and miserly asshole, even though he might be at times.

747
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:52,509
Rym: Well, there was a point.

748
00:47:52,919 --> 00:47:53,089
Scott: Yes.

749
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,749
Rym: But that's kind of the whole point, I guess, of the life and times of Scrooge McDuck.

750
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:06,530
Scott: The whole point is to turn the idea of, you know, the rich asshole on its head to be like, no, look, someone can be rich and awesome and not be a rich asshole.

751
00:48:06,711 --> 00:48:16,550
Rym: This is the story of Scrooge, a young Scottish lad whose family is destitute to the point that they don't even own their ancestral castle.

752
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:22,730
Scott: They had a castle, you know, because it's their, you know, the Scottish ancestry and whatnot, you know, the Castle McDuck.

753
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:26,290
Scott: But they lost it because they had no money and he had to like shine shoes.

754
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:27,573
Rym: And it goes from.

755
00:48:27,593 --> 00:48:33,130
Rym: he makes an American dime, which is worth bupkis in Scotland at the time.

756
00:48:33,873 --> 00:48:40,150
Rym: And it was the first dime he ever made, the first money he ever made from there to being the richest duck in the world.

757
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,730
Rym: And he earns every single last bit of it.

758
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:48,750
Scott: With his own hard work, not with any scheming or stealing or anything like that.

759
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:59,007
Rym: But I mean, if you look at the back of this book, you'll see this progression because the cool thing is there's kind of like an iconic picture of Scrooge from each era of his life.

760
00:48:59,491 --> 00:49:06,809
Rym: And in the back of the book, you have this kind of progression of all of them all the way through from the young kid shoe like shining boots to the end.

761
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,010
Scott: Yeah, it shows you every stage of his life from eighteen seventy seven to nineteen forty seven.

762
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:15,269
Scott: Now, I think part of the problem is, you know, this makes sense if you use those years.

763
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,830
Scott: But by those years, Scrooge McDuck shouldn't be around anymore.

764
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:21,570
Rym: Well, well, don't worry about that.

765
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,249
Scott: At least not yet.

766
00:49:22,732 --> 00:49:24,430
Scott: Plus, I believe he does die.

767
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:25,410
Rym: I mean, he dies.

768
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:26,890
Rym: Eventually he dies.

769
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:27,430
Scott: I don't know.

770
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:32,410
Scott: I there may or may not be some story somewhere whereby magic is there is magic going on.

771
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:40,008
Scott: According, there may be some immortality action happening according to the lives and times in Duckburg.

772
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:46,570
Rym: The epitaph on Scrooge McDuck's tomb in the end is Fortuna Favit Fortibus.

773
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,127
Scott: All righty then.

774
00:49:48,311 --> 00:49:49,729
Rym: Fortune favors the bold.

775
00:49:50,536 --> 00:49:51,230
Scott: It does indeed.

776
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,990
Rym: But this is a biography and it reads like one.

777
00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:00,430
Rym: It is a. it is the rise, fall and rise again of Scrooge McDuck.

778
00:50:01,011 --> 00:50:10,910
Rym: Because he tries so hard and fights so hard, and yet he ends up failing a lot of the time and fails a whole bunch of times before he makes it anywhere.

779
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,390
Rym: But then he finally makes it.

780
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,670
Scott: Obviously, he makes it because there's a money bid.

781
00:50:14,731 --> 00:50:15,670
Scott: That's not a spoiler.

782
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:23,270
Rym: But the cool thing is, like the way this isn't really a spoiler either, because you all know that there is the horrible evil money grubbing by McDuck.

783
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:32,808
Rym: The story progresses from like his youthful idealism gets lost bit by bit as the reality of an evil and vicious world kind of crushes him.

784
00:50:34,313 --> 00:50:36,490
Rym: And every time he does the right thing, he gets screwed.

785
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:40,210
Rym: And over time, he starts getting more and more ruthless and more and more canny.

786
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,889
Scott: He keeps doing the right thing and he keeps getting more money.

787
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:49,370
Scott: But, you know, it's the reality of what's going on is very upsetting and depressing.

788
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:55,869
Rym: But eventually it gets to the point where Scrooge does the wrong thing and it haunts him.

789
00:50:56,492 --> 00:51:00,470
Rym: And the kind of the near the end, you get to this point where he's lost it.

790
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,489
Rym: He's basically citizen Kane at this point.

791
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:05,150
Rym: He is basically just locked away in his mansion.

792
00:51:05,411 --> 00:51:06,810
Rym: There's this that chapter.

793
00:51:07,011 --> 00:51:12,909
Rym: And this is one of those iconic pictures of Scrooge McDuck is him sitting there in his mansion as an old man wrapped up.

794
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,070
Rym: And he says, me, I'm different.

795
00:51:15,591 --> 00:51:17,609
Rym: Everybody hates me and I hate everybody.

796
00:51:18,137 --> 00:51:18,325
Scott: Yep.

797
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:20,909
Rym: And then that's not the end.

798
00:51:21,231 --> 00:51:28,850
Rym: The rest of the book, which isn't that long, is basically the redemption of Scrooge McDuck and then the kind of the carrying on of his legs.

799
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:36,649
Scott: Like the final issue is pretty much explains, you know, how did we get from, you know, Scrooge McDuck who hates everybody to DuckTales?

800
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:37,348
Rym: Yes.

801
00:51:37,592 --> 00:51:38,430
Rym: But it's wonderful.

802
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:46,390
Rym: It's kind of how Huey, Dewey and Louie, not so much Donald carry on the legacy and are instilled with this sense of adventure.

803
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:52,849
Scott: And Scrooge McDuck is pretty much the coolest duck ever, except, well, he's not a duck, so we'll say, OK.

804
00:51:53,131 --> 00:51:56,649
Scott: But I think there's actually a character in this book who's better than Scrooge McDuck.

805
00:51:57,796 --> 00:51:58,410
Rym: Teddy Roosevelt.

806
00:51:58,799 --> 00:51:58,888
Scott: Yes.

807
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:07,610
Rym: Teddy Roosevelt and Scrooge McDuck get along, except for the fact that Scrooge McDuck always beats Teddy Roosevelt when they fight.

808
00:52:09,071 --> 00:52:15,629
Scott: And Teddy Roosevelt doesn't have to learn some of the lessons that Scrooge has to learn because he already learned them being, you know, Teddy Roosevelt and all.

809
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:23,370
Rym: But I mean, I don't want to talk a lot about it because it's one of those things where I could go on and on about all the scenes I liked and there's a lot of them.

810
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:30,149
Scott: But one thing I love about it so much is that, you know, you've got stories of, you know, Scrooge in Africa on safaris.

811
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:32,310
Scott: You've got stories of Scrooge in the Wild West.

812
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,150
Scott: You get stories of Scrooge in the Yukon.

813
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,369
Scott: You've got medieval stories.

814
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:37,230
Scott: You've got Scotland stories.

815
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:44,010
Scott: You've got, you know, seemingly how, you know, how could someone have, you know, all these different things in one lifetime?

816
00:52:44,191 --> 00:52:46,589
Scott: But they make it all work.

817
00:52:47,072 --> 00:52:50,790
Scott: You know, it's usually, you know, you watch like Mickey and the Beanstalk, right?

818
00:52:50,891 --> 00:52:52,770
Scott: And then you watch Prince and the Pauper.

819
00:52:52,911 --> 00:52:57,330
Scott: And then maybe you watch like Mickey in outer space and then Mickey in modern times hanging on the Internet.

820
00:52:57,972 --> 00:53:00,990
Scott: And you don't expect all of those to fit in the same world.

821
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:08,150
Scott: And if someone tried to make up a reason for them to fit in the same universe and for that to actually be the same Mickey Mouse, it would make no sense whatsoever.

822
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:09,769
Scott: It'd be hackneyed and BS.

823
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:20,030
Scott: But yet we have all these completely, seemingly separate things that you could not under any normal circumstances be the same person in the same lifetime.

824
00:53:20,896 --> 00:53:21,890
Scott: But no, it totally works.

825
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:22,970
Scott: And it's totally correct.

826
00:53:23,295 --> 00:53:24,329
Scott: And it's totally awesome.

827
00:53:25,151 --> 00:53:28,930
Scott: And, you know, it's great because people like all these different kinds of stories.

828
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:41,369
Scott: People like outer space stories, you know, gyro gear loose gadget stories, you know, you know, I guess mafia crime stories, Beagle Boys trying to steal the money while the Beagle Boys.

829
00:53:42,616 --> 00:53:45,310
Scott: You can get all of the different kinds of stories.

830
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:56,470
Scott: There are all the different settings and whatnot with the same characters you like and not have to, you know, have any sort of dissonance in your mind at all.

831
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,989
Scott: You can carry from one to the next and it's a OK.

832
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:01,210
Rym: And it's just it's a romp.

833
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:01,809
Rym: It's a fan.

834
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:04,110
Rym: I mean, you'll read it pretty much start to finish.

835
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:06,310
Scott: I mean, it is wordy, though.

836
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:16,690
Scott: I mean, this isn't like a lot of more modern comics or like manga where as a big picture and like a few words and like a speech bubble, like, oh, no, but it's not like old crappy.

837
00:54:16,912 --> 00:54:18,290
Rym: I hit you, you little guy.

838
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:21,110
Scott: As you know, it's as wordy as Stan Lee.

839
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:25,130
Scott: There's as many words on the page and as many panels as like a Stan Lee comic.

840
00:54:25,593 --> 00:54:27,090
Scott: But the words are meaningful.

841
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:28,335
Scott: It's not.

842
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:31,410
Scott: the words aren't just repeating what you see in the picture.

843
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:40,830
Scott: You know, it's people say a lot of stuff and, you know, because they're having actual big conversations and each comic is only, you know, 20 something pages long.

844
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:48,369
Scott: So when someone's got a lot to say and you got a lot of things happening and only so few pages, you're going to have to put a lot of words on the page.

845
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:54,550
Scott: And so it takes a little longer to read than another comic of equivalent size.

846
00:54:55,053 --> 00:54:56,149
Scott: But, you know, it works out.

847
00:54:56,571 --> 00:55:01,760
Scott: And one other interesting thing, right, is that, you know, every comic has sort of the same visual format, right?

848
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,349
Scott: There's a cover.

849
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:07,070
Scott: And then on the first page, there's one panel that takes up the top half of the page.

850
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:13,250
Scott: And that's like the splash page in that splash or no on the cover or is that on the splash page?

851
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:17,783
Scott: I forget like the he hides the word duck somewhere.

852
00:55:18,505 --> 00:55:19,990
Scott: or is it there or maybe the word?

853
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:21,490
Scott: I forget exactly what's hidden.

854
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,269
Rym: I couldn't find most of them.

855
00:55:23,592 --> 00:55:23,694
Scott: Yeah.

856
00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:24,346
Scott: Oh, that's right.

857
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:29,930
Scott: I think the word duck is hidden on the cover and the splash page, maybe something like that.

858
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:35,730
Scott: I don't know, but it's hidden in there and it's sort of like one of those, you know, find the hidden thingy stuff.

859
00:55:35,891 --> 00:55:37,810
Scott: And it's fun to do it.

860
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,029
Scott: It's sort of like an added bonus.

861
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:43,150
Scott: You're reading this comic, but right before you start reading it, you're like looking for hidden things.

862
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:46,930
Scott: And actually imagery wise, you know, the art is so detailed.

863
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:51,590
Scott: There are lots of sort of images hidden in the background, not as much as, say, Watchman.

864
00:55:51,952 --> 00:55:54,950
Scott: But like in the final issue, there's an Eisner Award on the wall.

865
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:58,450
Scott: That's pretty funny and other other similar things like that.

866
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:03,450
Scott: You know, there'll be artifacts that Scrooge has collected from in previous issues.

867
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:08,270
Scott: And you'll see them appear again in later issues, like in a bookshelf or something like that.

868
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:10,450
Scott: And it's all good.

869
00:56:10,895 --> 00:56:11,288
Scott: I like that.

870
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:13,169
Rym: I think we can honestly leave it at that.

871
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:18,587
Rym: I mean, when you talk about something as good as this, there's very little to say other than read it.

872
00:56:19,571 --> 00:56:21,850
Rym: And then maybe we could do a spoilery show.

873
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:29,350
Rym: But I don't know if this really suits that, because a spoilery show would just be us going, man, remember when Scrooge did this?

874
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:31,370
Rym: Oh, man, remember when Scrooge did this?

875
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:32,228
Scott: Oh, man.

876
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:33,329
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

877
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,470
Scott: But I mean, a lot of people, you know, they think about Disney.

878
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:40,229
Scott: They think it's some kiddie thing or they, you know, they they push it.

879
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:41,355
Scott: You know, they don't.

880
00:56:41,557 --> 00:56:43,510
Scott: they don't think this is something that they should be reading.

881
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:46,990
Scott: This is something that every human being should read in their lives.

882
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:56,950
Scott: And if you like it a lot, there's another book, which is the Life and Times Excusion McDuck Companion, which has a few extra issues in it to sort of fill in a couple of tiny gaps.

883
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:04,210
Scott: And if you really like that, you can actually go and buy, you know, you can get Scrooge McDuck comics every month.

884
00:57:04,673 --> 00:57:07,049
Scott: You can even go back and read old Karl Barks comics.

885
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:09,790
Scott: There's hundreds and hundreds of comics.

886
00:57:10,132 --> 00:57:13,890
Scott: It's the most circulated thing in Finland and other northern European countries.

887
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:18,210
Rym: You can even get the Clan McDuck tartan, which is legitimate in Scotland.

888
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:19,077
Scott: Yeah.

889
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:19,450
Scott: Yeah.

890
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:26,390
Scott: So this is you know, there is no shortage of this material, but this is the starting place and also the ending place.

891
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:26,972
Rym: Yes.

892
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:31,349
Rym: But it's one of those things where this is the seed and I'm not going to say you'll know if you like it.

893
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:32,375
Rym: You'll like it.

894
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:34,249
Rym: or you're a terrible person.

895
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:34,853
Scott: Yeah.

896
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,206
Scott: Or you are a terrible person.

897
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:36,488
Scott: Come on.

898
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,850
Scott: The discount on Amazon's got to be cheap at seven.

899
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:40,172
Scott: Let's see.

900
00:57:40,192 --> 00:57:41,627
Scott: Let me go look it up and then we'll end the show.

901
00:57:42,571 --> 00:57:43,033
Scott: Oh, my God.

902
00:57:43,073 --> 00:57:47,250
Scott: OK, so it's twelve dollars and twenty three cents.

903
00:57:47,971 --> 00:57:52,570
Scott: You'll spend more money on like a CD, spend more money on lunch today.

904
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:53,439
Rym: I went to Good Burger.

905
00:57:53,621 --> 00:57:53,985
Scott: Yeah.

906
00:57:54,147 --> 00:57:54,350
Scott: Yeah.

907
00:57:54,491 --> 00:57:56,501
Scott: So you got to buy this.

908
00:57:57,004 --> 00:57:58,070
Scott: There's no excuse not to.

909
00:57:58,532 --> 00:57:59,903
Scott: I mean, the library will have it.

910
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:00,769
Scott: I'm pretty sure anyway.

911
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:01,551
Scott: All right.

912
00:58:01,592 --> 00:58:02,236
Scott: Come on, people.

913
00:58:02,498 --> 00:58:04,030
Scott: Scrooge McDuck kicks her ass.

914
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,328
Rym: I believe you mean McDuck.

915
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:06,122
Scott: McDuck.

916
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,870
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

917
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:17,450

919
00:58:29,991 --> 00:58:35,630
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

920
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,709
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

921

Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

922
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:46,250
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

930
00:59:25,052 --> 00:59:28,170
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
