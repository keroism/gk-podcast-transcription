00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:17,094
Rym: It's warm out and tonight We are reviewing.

5
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:20,629
Rym: mama hosted us the boy and the beast beasts.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,063
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:27,256
Rym: and Yeah, TLDR version.

8
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:30,250
Rym: We're gonna tell you to go see it, but the review will get into more detail.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,345
Scott: I guess what if we ever said for an anime movie don't go see it.

10
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:41,850
Rym: Yeah, I mean the anime movies We'd tell you not to go see are the ones that we either didn't watch or we don't talk about or we're not gonna watch.

11
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:45,369
Rym: Yeah, there aren't that many bad anime movies that I've seen?

12
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:46,053
Rym: well I guess there are.

13
00:00:46,073 --> 00:00:46,757
Rym: I mean we never did.

14
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:49,090
Rym: we never did like Armageddon or do Megalopolis.

15
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:52,621
Scott: I guess I won't necessarily tell you not to watch.

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:01:02,294
Rym: actually I was talking to multiple people about Both of those anime recently and in all these conversations the end result was basically It's kind of like apocalypse.

17
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:05,966
Rym: zero may not be the greatest thing, but it's worth seeing it.

18
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:07,130
Scott: for reasons?

19
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:14,728
Rym: Yeah, not not because reasons is boy in the V's exactly But yeah, so it's crazy warm out and it's biking season.

20
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:16,215
Rym: finally I think I'd like to work tomorrow.

21
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:21,054
Scott: I'm in a new office or the biking situation is not fixed yet But my boss.

22
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,365
Scott: boss was like I'm gonna take a project and fix that.

23
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,392
Scott: so I guess I got to wait for the old bikes And building.

24
00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:28,761
Rym: yeah, my old company kept saying that they never fixed it.

25
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:35,010
Scott: well apparently this building used to have a bike Rack in the basement, but it's under construction now and like renovating and shit.

26
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:38,910
Scott: So I is when it finishes that might resolve.

27
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,861
Scott: But my co-worker who bikes he put his.

28
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:42,370
Scott: he tied his bike up outside the off.

29
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:48,705
Rym: I would do that if my company gave me in writing Something that said they will buy me a brand new bike of equivalent quality.

30
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,609
Rym: if my bike gets stolen Any number of times if it's stolen while I'm working so?

31
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:57,190
Scott: But when we just I just left the office with him I was in the elevator.

32
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,854
Scott: We walked out.

33
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:58,619
Scott: his bike was gone.

34
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,290
Scott: his bike was right there in front of the building.

35
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:04,986
Rym: Yeah, I mean I locked my bike up in Manhattan like 50 or 60 times before that one day.

36
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:10,318
Scott: It was gone, so Goodbye a Easier to carry lock.

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,569
Scott: the lock I have is like way big.

38
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,493
Rym: yeah I know I have.

39
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,952
Rym: I have one like pretty big lock and I have one crazy lock that I use like when I go to Brooklyn.

40
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:17,575
Scott: yeah, I'll go buy.

41
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:20,209
Scott: I should buy like a normal size one with the cable attached to it.

42
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:21,796
Rym: So anyway, I got.

43
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:22,519
Rym: I got some news.

44
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:23,865
Rym: It's an animated movie.

45
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:28,328
Rym: because I'm not reviewing it now But I'm gonna geek bite it briefly up in the patreon.

46
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,915
Rym: Emily And I are gonna do in the room.

47
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:38,301
Rym: Lee reviews a full review of it this weekend, but Zootopia Probably the best Disney movie in 20 years and 20 years.

48
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:40,608
Scott: Yeah, let me see what's happened.

49
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:48,402
Scott: 20 years ago was 96. yeah, you're gonna go like when did Lion King Aladdin come?

50
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:50,167
Rym: uh when did they come out?

51
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:51,250
Rym: probably before then?

52
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,399
Rym: I've lost track of all that Yep, so uh you know what.

53
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:58,944
Rym: yeah better than line.

54
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:01,312
Scott: Aladdin was 92.

55
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:02,497
Rym: Yeah, all right all right.

56
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,705
Rym: so Lion King Aladdin are beyond the horizon.

57
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,236
Scott: a Disney movie since 96.

58
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:08,629
Rym: Aladdin and the Lion King.

59
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:09,713
Rym: Let's see here.

60
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:13,626
Rym: I get a list of every Disney movie, so let's see 95.

61
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,235
Rym: Toy Story was 95 That's not 96.

62
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:17,661
Rym: Yeah, 96.

63
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:18,664
Rym: James the giant peach.

64
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:22,332
Rym: no the hunchback of Notre Dame Hercules.

65
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:23,115
Scott: well I mean you got.

66
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:25,984
Scott: if you're Hercules you got to go to a story to Toy Story 3.

67
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:27,067
Rym: all right all right.

68
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:31,441
Scott: Toy Story 2 All those others all those other Pixar movies Dinosaur.

69
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,570
Rym: oh So I really like the Emperor's New Groove.

70
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,321
Scott: Yeah, I think that movies overrated.

71
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:43,140
Rym: I think it's the best Disney movie other than Zootopia in that era.

72
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,846
Rym: what about that?

73
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:47,252
Rym: may be like Toy Story 2 3.

74
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:48,462
Rym: Lilo & Stitch was super good.

75
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:53,302
Rym: all right Might be better than Lilo & Stitch by a tiny hair.

76
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:55,650
Rym: get it anyway.

77
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:58,045
Scott: What else is down there?

78
00:03:59,410 --> 00:03:59,812
Rym: Tales of Earth?

79
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,219
Rym: oh, that's just yeah tales of Earth.

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,069
Rym: the Ghibli so Tangled was really good.

81
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:06,941
Rym: Yeah, Mars Needs Moms not not gonna.

82
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:08,445
Rym: Brave is pretty good.

83
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,030
Rym: Wreck-It Ralph is pretty good.

84
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:11,403
Rym: Frozen was okay.

85
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:15,616
Rym: I Actually almost why.

86
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,110
Rym: well, I guess this is also mixing Pixar and Walt Disney Studios.

87
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,558
Scott: Well, I mean isn't Zootopia Pixar movie.

88
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,587
Rym: No everyone keeps saying that it's not okay.

89
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:25,470
Scott: That's interesting.

90
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:29,724
Scott: It's a Disney Studios movie, so why is it all CG and not all 2d.

91
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:32,572
Rym: It's animated all right In fact.

92
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:38,696
Rym: uh you were I think 90% of the people I've talked to about this movie assumed It was Pixar incorrectly.

93
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:42,470
Scott: what other CG movies has Disney made that weren't Pixar?

94
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:45,969
Rym: Emily's shouting from the other room correcting Scott heavily, but I digress.

95
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:52,665
Rym: Zootopia is Crazy good, and I would not say that lightly because I go into movies like this.

96
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:53,267
Scott: It was funny.

97
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:57,742
Rym: Yeah, so Then you know there's always the worry if a trailer is pretty good like that.

98
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,430
Rym: like will the movie be as good?

99
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,457
Scott: Usually you put your best joke in the trailer.

100
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:03,946
Rym: Yeah, the movie did far from that.

101
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:08,140
Rym: so Zootopia Exceeded my expectations in a way that I can.

102
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:15,866
Rym: I can name very few movies that have ever actually Legitimately exceeded my expectations to that degree and I already came in with pretty high ones.

103
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:26,337
Rym: so What I'll say is that it deals with issues of discrimination very pointedly and in a Surprisingly elegant and nuanced way.

104
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:32,795
Rym: I am deeply impressed with this movie and all I'm gonna say is that you should definitely go see it If you haven't seen it already.

105
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:36,330
Rym: also it appears to be on track to break some box-office records.

106
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:38,230
Rym: It's going crazy in the theater.

107
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:44,107
Scott: Well there haven't been you know a movie that got the kids out to the theater since like frozen me so

108
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:53,396
Rym: so Funny when we were at the theater the audience was about a third families with kids on a Sunday like evening show And the rest of it

109
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,180
Scott: was em furries.

110
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,090
Rym: Yeah, the rest of it was all adults like us, right?

111
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,230
Scott: I mean you know that's what's happening these days.

112
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:05,133
Scott: Yeah, I mean like a movie is gonna get the most people in cuz you get the families and the nerds like yeah A good dichotomy.

113
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:08,570
Rym: you'll see is there's those equestria girls movies that sometimes are in theaters.

114
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,609
Rym: That's pretty much all little kids.

115
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:18,104
Rym: But when the right the actual My Little Pony feature film comes out pretty sure whenever I go to see it It's gonna be mostly people around my age in that theater.

116
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:18,929
Scott: Yeah, I'll go see that.

117
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:23,046
Scott: Yeah, actually based on gonna see in the theater the whole getting DVD.

118
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:33,219
Rym: Oh I might see in the theater just because I want to see it early cuz you know weebs are gonna ruin it By telling me everything about it, how's that gonna ruin it?

119
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:36,690
Rym: uh yeah, you have your weird spoiler opinion that I still disagree with.

120
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:42,082
Rym: I'm not saying spoilers are the biggest deal in the world, but you take a Somewhat narrow view of it.

121
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:43,532
Rym: anyway Go see.

122
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:47,509
Scott: something can be ruined by learning information, but it was not good in the first place.

123
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:48,921
Rym: no But the experience is different.

124
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:55,090
Rym: the second time you see movie Someone better when you know more now why not see it twice, and then you get both experiences.

125
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:58,453
Scott: They are both different because the first I could just learn everything about it And then see it.

126
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:01,169
Scott: it'll be a great experience, and I only had to pay waste my time once.

127
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:05,162
Rym: Uh I guess if wasting your time is how you treat watching movies.

128
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:06,527
Rym: then go nuts anyway.

129
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:07,390
Rym: go see Zootopia.

130
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:11,270
Rym: It is utterly fantastic and nuanced to a degree that I did not expect.

131
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:11,711
Scott: It's like.

132
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:15,020
Scott: it's like if a food is delicious right is it?

133
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:18,129
Scott: is it not delicious the first time and the second time is different.

134
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:22,850
Rym: God there are very few movies that I watch more than three or four times.

135
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:25,528
Rym: But I eat ice cream hundreds and hundreds of times in my life.

136
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,135
Scott: Huh was it?

137
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:29,409
Scott: was the ice cream spoiled that the second time you ate it.

138
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:33,286
Rym: It was very as a different experience because the first time I had never experienced that before.

139
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:36,420
Scott: so there's Delicious the second time.

140
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,305
Rym: I don't have a tongue orgasm the hundreds time I ate ice cream But I probably had one the first time.

141
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,660
Scott: no I'm pretty sure a tongue orgasm every time.

142
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,908
Rym: I still disagree with you.

143
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,274
Rym: anyway Do you have any news?

144
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:49,491
Rym: since you're the reason we have to review Zootopia on the patreon is cuz you're probably not gonna see It.

145
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:52,364
Scott: why would I go to the movie theater to see that you don't see any movies anymore.

146
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:53,810
Scott: I see a lot of movies.

147
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,936
Scott: I watched every Zatoichi.

148
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:57,830
Scott: Yeah, you watch a lot of 26 movies to your one movie.

149
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,657
Rym: Well, then maybe you should do a patreon and review them all.

150
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:04,935
Scott: maybe I shouldn't because no it's not worth paying money for But you can watch all.

151
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:08,110
Scott: you can watch all the Zatoichi movies on Hulu for zero dollars.

152
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:08,788
Scott: You should do that.

153
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:12,990
Rym: I'm curious how many of you would pay a dollar to listen to Scott review all the Zatoichi movies.

154
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:14,335
Scott: Stupid people.

155
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:18,007
Scott: All right, if you've got a dollar for that, you should just invest the dollar.

156
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:25,230
Rym: There's a website I went to today that's got a dollar will make you rounding zero dollars over your entire life.

157
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,033
Scott: That is correct ever.

158
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:32,797
Scott: I went to a website today that said if you invested a dollar every day of your life How much would you have invested?

159
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,870
Scott: because how many days have you lived and how much would that be now?

160
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:41,389
Scott: And if I had done that I would have spent like twelve thousand dollars and I would have about fifty five thousand dollars right now.

161
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:45,910
Rym: Yeah, but about dollar that's just like thirty bucks a month.

162
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,169
Rym: That's what most people are putting away into like their 401ks because I don't have a lot of money.

163
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,190
Scott: I'm putting a lot more than thirty dollars.

164
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:57,536
Rym: Most people are putting any maximum Maximum allowed percentage.

165
00:08:57,857 --> 00:09:00,930
Rym: Anyway, do you have any animation or comic news?

166
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,625
Scott: Yes, the speaking of Hulu where you can watch all 26 25 Zatoichi movies.

167
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:14,983
Scott: You can also watch best they put it on there like less than a week ago all 25 or 26 episodes of Azumanga die.

168
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:21,175
Scott: Oh, you know again, I watched two episodes and That show is still good.

169
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:21,838
Scott: But you know what?

170
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:27,025
Scott: It's kind of weird because compared to my memory It's the exact same show except for two things.

171
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:44,830
Scott: number one Something being in a non widescreen aspect ratio and like 480 not non widescreen is a lot like laugh tracks now Not P at all and some of the drawings are not that they looked really good back then But now it's like there's some definitely bad drawing.

172
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:49,086
Rym: I had that problem the other day when you know Cuz the new Powerpuff Girls is coming and I watched one of the shorts they did.

173
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:49,610
Rym: it was great.

174
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:53,290
Rym: So I went back and watched one of my favorite old episodes of the Powerpuff Girls.

175
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,609
Rym: It was good, but it was weird to see something so low-res and in a square effectively.

176
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:05,257
Scott: Yeah, by the way in the new Powerpuff Girls trailer You know, it is confirmed.

177
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:09,673
Scott: the most important thing that makes me know that shows gonna be good as good as the old one At least is that.

178
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,242
Rym: yeah, of course him was there.

179
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,730
Rym: him is the best part of the Powerpuff Girls.

180
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,834
Scott: I wasn't sure they were gonna keep him.

181
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:22,154
Rym: Well, the second best part the best part is that the professor's kind of a doofus Him is still in.

182
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,580
Scott: Yeah, that's what we need to know.

183
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:30,750
Scott: Oh, so yeah, the other thing about Azumanga die Besides the square shape is that that show is really disjointed.

184
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:37,943
Scott: I mean it was always based on like yeah the four panel comics, but it's like The episodes just like all way more.

185
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:41,399
Scott: there were always all over the place But they're even more all over the place than I remember.

186
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:43,970
Rym: I guess that's kind of what I remember and expected.

187
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,836
Scott: Of course, I have also.

188
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:46,941
Scott: everything else is still true.

189
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,267
Scott: Like the drunk teachers the best.

190
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:50,516
Rym: Yeah Oh, it's like I with that knife.

191
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:53,368
Rym: Yeah, or when she's in the bathroom constantly.

192
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:55,215
Scott: Oh my god I just remember that.

193
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:55,998
Scott: get it together.

194
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:57,183
Scott: I just remember the screensaver.

195
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:02,027
Scott: Yeah, I Was like I'm walking around the CG room doing stuff.

196
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:06,090
Rym: Yeah We had that on both our computers in RIT for a long time.

197
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:07,814
Rym: Good days.

198
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:09,103
Scott: Maybe I can find that and run it.

199
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:10,550
Scott: Will it run on Windows 10?

200
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:16,585
Rym: I think the other reason that I'm not surprised by the disjointedness or I guess like I wouldn't I don't think that would be Something that I would have forgotten and then go.

201
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:22,650
Rym: Oh, right Is that I basically watched all of Nichijou which does the same thing and I also really like Nichijou.

202
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,694
Rym: It's kind of in the same genre.

203
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:27,930
Scott: I only watched like two episodes of Nichijou and I didn't see any goats getting somersault.

204
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:30,099
Rym: You should watch all of Nichijou.

205
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:33,172
Scott: I couldn't even tell what was going on in the two episodes I watched.

206
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:36,081
Rym: there are pretty straightforward short narratives.

207
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:38,750
Scott: It's usually something like I don't like introduce the characters though.

208
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:39,718
Scott: Okay, I'm just like.

209
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,929
Scott: I'm just like who the hell is this?

210
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,940
Rym: Star Wars did such a great job of introducing all the characters.

211
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,038
Scott: Azumanga Daioh does a good job of introducing the characters Because it has more of a very hard.

212
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:54,430
Scott: the very first scene is they show after the teacher You know crashes or drops your chain off her bike and they get to the classroom.

213
00:11:54,811 --> 00:12:05,746
Scott: They show you each person and show you their name on the screen and it's like Tomo-chan the crazy You know Genius, you know prodigy.

214
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,310
Scott: in GeoChat.

215
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:08,515
Scott: They tell you each person is.

216
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:12,484
Scott: and then the second episode is just an introduction of Osaka.

217
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:22,520
Scott: The whole second episode is Osaka omen Things of the day.

218
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:28,880
Rym: Emily found this last night and it's that's good because she's better fun things really really really good.

219
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:31,532
Rym: So red line was an amazing movie.

220
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:33,080
Rym: We reviewed on GeekNights some time ago.

221
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,724
Rym: It's not my favorite anime movies Like the more I think about it.

222
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:39,038
Rym: pretty good just it's that kind of weird movie that I like.

223
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:39,620
Rym: that is not.

224
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,624
Scott: I only watched it once.

225
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:43,717
Scott: I feel like I should watch it one more time because I can.

226
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:44,540
Rym: it's why it's a movie.

227
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,799
Rym: I feel like I could watch matrix level number of times and never get tired of it.

228
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,106
Scott: I don't know if I watch it that many times.

229
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:49,911
Scott: think I could.

230
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:51,299
Scott: I should watch the matrix and I go.

231
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:58,313
Scott: So this is an AMV to Red line isn't it the whole thing on AMV to begin with?

232
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,200
Scott: is it really necessary to make AMV out of it?

233
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,959
Rym: Well, this AMV does a very good job.

234
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:02,383
Rym: 5 5 5 AMV.

235
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:08,220
Rym: There's two fundamental kinds of AMVs on this level.

236
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:19,152
Rym: There's the AMV that just takes the aesthetic of a show and does something with it And there's an AMV that retells the show or retells the movie With the backdrop of music almost like a summary.

237
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:20,920
Rym: This is more like the latter kind.

238
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:26,304
Rym: So if you've never seen red line go watch red line first Then watch this AMV.

239
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:30,034
Rym: It's one of those AMVs that reminds you how fucking amazing red line is.

240
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,080
Scott: Yeah, just watch Oh, baby, baby.

241
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:39,307
Rym: Yeah Because that actually doesn't really spoil anything significant about utana Even if it does.

242
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:42,060
Scott: but you wouldn't understand like you wouldn't know what the fuck you're seeing.

243
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:56,285
Scott: It's more like it hints at whoa The show goes way off the rails down the road and also it's got you know, some Sega Saturn actions Like you see someone fighting and like they're gonna duel and they might not not anyway, the Thing of the day, right?

244
00:13:56,305 --> 00:14:00,339
Scott: So someone made this funny video cowboy beep boop beep boop beep boop.

245
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:12,280
Scott: It's a little funny kind of like retelling of an early episode of cowboy bebop the one with the ventriloquist dummy That's like alive but as a person but isn't or whatever, you know, they're the kid who looks like one but it's young.

246
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:13,825
Scott: You should see that episode.

247
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:17,277
Scott: It's actually one of the I think not as good episodes a cowboy bebop.

248
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:18,000
Rym: I would agree with that.

249
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:24,456
Scott: But here I mean not that you know, even the worst episode of cowboy bebop is great Like other people don't like the chess one.

250
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:24,860
Scott: I like that.

251
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,640
Rym: Well, it has the problem of that.

252
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,658
Rym: It's in that Twilight Zone between the first episode and the fifth episode that everyone goes.

253
00:14:31,678 --> 00:14:34,960
Rym: Oh shit It's in the Twilight Zone between cowboy bebop and Batman.

254
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:46,768
Scott: But yeah So but someone retells that episode in like a few seconds with this quirky little not even animation like Animatic almost just some pencil drawings and some voiceover.

255
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:49,475
Scott: good and it's still way funny.

256
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,340
Scott: It's like it's like a gift plus plus.

257
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:56,685
Scott: It's worth your 10 seconds of time Beep-boop in the meta moment.

258
00:14:57,027 --> 00:15:00,218
Rym: The book club book is probably gonna be Oryx and Craig Margaret Atwood.

259
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:00,880
Rym: So stay tuned.

260
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,188
Rym: I haven't announced it yet.

261
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:02,973
Scott: Yeah, no good ideas.

262
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:03,316
Scott: You're on your.

263
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:03,980
Scott: still my ideas.

264
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,819
Rym: I got that idea from Emily and Adam and Kate not from you.

265
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,418
Scott: I got the idea cuz I kept hearing Margaret at was named like a hundred times.

266
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:16,145
Scott: Yeah Adam and Kate more people than that But yes them also else.

267
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:21,964
Rym: name one other human being who brought that book up something on internet such as someone Some guy in the internet.

268
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:23,130
Scott: I saw some tweets or something.

269
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,140
Scott: Plus there was that video where she was a hockey goalie.

270
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:28,255
Rym: No, yeah, which was my thing of the day.

271
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:28,858
Scott: It's fine.

272
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:29,360
Scott: Doesn't matter?

273
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,780
Scott: I kept hearing it a bunch and I said, all right next book club book.

274
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:35,586
Scott: I get I'm picking one of your books and then you come in Picking one her books.

275
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:37,779
Scott: now, I got to find something else like a different one of her books.

276
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:39,871
Scott: We're not doing the same author twice in a row.

277
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:40,233
Rym: Why not?

278
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:41,198
Scott: That's not allowed.

279
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:41,440
Rym: Why not?

280
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:41,962
Rym: I'll just do.

281
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,769
Rym: I'll just do every Prince of Nothing book one by one.

282
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:49,453
Scott: No, we got spread some love love must be spread But I haven't announced it officially.

283
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:50,600
Scott: she doesn't deserve two picks.

284
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:56,000
Rym: I'm saying no one deserved two picks cuz I kind of started the 11th book of the Wheel of Time.

285
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,873
Rym: I'm finding out more about what Randall tour is up to.

286
00:15:58,893 --> 00:15:59,556
Rym: I get spoilers.

287
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:00,320
Rym: He's still alive.

288
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:05,714
Scott: You don't say yeah The main character lives to all the books and you only can die in the last one.

289
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:07,380
Rym: actually is anyone know?

290
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,569
Rym: So I'm so I haven't read the end.

291
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,216
Rym: So this is not a spoiler.

292
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,291
Scott: if you're a main character You can't die until the end of the book at the final book.

293
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,034
Scott: That's how things work.

294
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:17,175
Rym: Ah, yeah, you can Really?

295
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,863
Scott: Okay, so That's dead is what you're saying.

296
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:24,776
Rym: It's not a spoiler because well, he died and then came back.

297
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:26,100
Scott: Yeah, that's a shame.

298
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:29,115
Rym: But anyway, it's not a spoiler cuz I didn't read the end yet.

299
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:30,040
Rym: I don't know what happens.

300
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:31,303
Rym: I'm pretty sure.

301
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:37,279
Rym: lose Theron in his head will die and Rand will not and that's the like thing that's gonna happen at the end.

302
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,607
Scott: Or ran will die and lose their hero.

303
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:42,175
Rym: Yeah, there's kind of a dick.

304
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:43,298
Scott: That's my guy.

305
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:52,919
Scott: Yeah a Really powerful dick, dude That's always the best character the really powerful jerk, right?

306
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,006

320
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:30,000

Scott: so if you all stop paying he'll just have to make those things public.

333
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,084
Rym: No, I probably wouldn't make him.

334
00:18:02,324 --> 00:18:04,171
Scott: He would still make probably not.

00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,120
Rym: so poor games poor games the whole time.

360
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,339
Scott: Maybe I'll bring my board game.

361
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:13,570
Rym: Yeah PAX East will be doing Atari game design one of our most recent lectures designing game rules, which People really seem to like this one.

362
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,219
Rym: And actually I watched it cuz I had to edit it.

363
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:16,404
Rym: It's pretty good panel.

364
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:17,808
Rym: Like we do a job.

365
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,032
Rym: I'm actually I'm proud of it.

366
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:19,494
Rym: It's in the.

367
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:20,738
Rym: it's in the top 10 panels.

368
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:26,853
Rym: We did a better job of it at magfest though Yeah, and I think we didn't record it there because we're like every video did.

369
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:27,455
Rym: who cares?

370
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:28,900
Scott: I was just too lazy.

371
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,755
Rym: Yeah, laziness is a big part of that but it's up on YouTube.

372
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:32,439
Rym: you can watch it.

373
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:34,467
Scott: There's no point in posting the same panel twice.

374
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:37,779
Rym: I posted the same panel twice a few times if we've crooked enough.

375
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,216
Scott: Yeah, make it time.

376
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:46,900
Rym: Beyond D&D is up twice because it evolved a lot between those early times and when we did it at PAX OS.

377
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:53,262
Scott: So our man mom or hosted continues to bet a thousand, you know, if you don't know who mom or hosted it is Right.

378
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:58,300
Scott: This is a guy who directed a bunch of animes and he sort of got really going with his Digimon movie.

379
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,806
Scott: We've is one piece movie.

380
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,716
Rym: We've reviewed most of the feature films.

381
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:04,800
Rym: He has ever done.

382
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,820
Scott: I don't think we reviewed girl who that through time.

383
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:08,027
Rym: I'm pretty sure we did.

384
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:09,879
Scott: if we didn't I cuz I don't think I've seen it.

385
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:10,983
Rym: I saw it with that.

386
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,389
Rym: You know what Emily and I can review it.

387
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:17,587
Scott: then on the patreon and I don't think Did he do the wolf children?

388
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:18,069
Scott: Is that?

389
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,296
Rym: yeah, there was wolf children.

390
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:20,140
Scott: I didn't see that one either.

391
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:28,530
Rym: You didn't see wolf children now, and then we saw summer wars Which was three years before Wolf children.

392
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:33,032
Scott: Yeah, and What else did he do besides bullying the Beast which we're talking about today?

393
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:34,558
Rym: Uh, one piece Baron.

394
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:37,165
Scott: Oh, not sorry I mentioned that already.

395
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:37,827
Scott: we reviewed that.

396
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:42,640
Rym: Yeah, I think he did the the anime opening samurai shampoo.

397
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,744
Rym: He did something with the opening.

398
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,490
Scott: I mean that doesn't.

399
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,815
Scott: I'm talking about like movies.

400
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:47,256
Scott: He's made.

401
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:47,919
Scott: He's a movie guy.

402
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:52,675
Scott: now Come to New York because he's already working on another movie.

403
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:53,700
Scott: He's like cranking him out.

404
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:59,426
Rym: Well Scott, if you're talking movies, the only other thing really in there is that super flat modding at Rym Which isn't really a movie.

405
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,780
Scott: just know it's not really okay, so that's all his movies.

406
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,044
Scott: So his new movie is the.

407
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:05,392
Scott: that's out is the boy and the Beast.

408
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:07,560
Scott: you can see in theaters in the US now.

409
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:13,040
Rym: Every one of his movies has been on a trajectory of increasingly furry and the trend has continued.

410
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:15,026
Rym: Girl at their time zero.

411
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:19,779
Rym: He is some wars the girls of kitsune in the in the magic space wolf children.

412
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:21,952
Rym: Yep, boy and the Beast.

413
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:25,048
Scott: Yep What was this wasn't his movie?

414
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:26,012
Scott: What was that movie?

415
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:38,127
Scott: It was like a fantasy Furries but not you know perverted ones and it was like that ballerina animal and there was like an adventure thing You're thinking of.

416
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,495
Scott: I'm not imagining this right.

417
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:41,258
Rym: No, you're.

418
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:45,439
Scott: I Think it was one of those ones where someone goes to another world.

419
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:48,044
Rym: Why story?

420
00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:48,887
Scott: oh, yeah.

421
00:21:48,947 --> 00:21:51,857
Scott: Okay that one aspects of hostedness in it.

422
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:52,439
Scott: Whoever made it?

423
00:21:53,101 --> 00:22:01,660
Rym: Anyway, but yeah member host is batting a thousand in the sense that while not every movie He has made has been a home run then a thousand just means you hit every ball.

424
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:04,795
Scott: Yeah, it's like every movie you make is a really good movie.

425
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:05,297
Scott: We're seeing.

426
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:07,948
Rym: yep So the TLC are better than others.

427
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:10,437
Rym: like we said, this is an anime movie.

428
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:11,400
Rym: It came out recently.

429
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,709
Rym: It's really good and you should definitely go see it.

430
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:16,320
Rym: if you care at all about anime or animation.

431
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:25,880
Rym: If you happen to like wolf children summer wars the girl who left through time You should really go see this movie because it is in his fashion like the kinds of things he's done before.

432
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:31,139
Scott: Yeah, it's like there's some people like Miyazaki or Satoshi khan where every time they get up to the plate home run.

433
00:22:31,823 --> 00:22:32,507
Scott: Maru hosted it.

434
00:22:32,547 --> 00:22:37,792
Scott: It's like every time he gets up to the plate he hits Sometimes home runs sometimes just double.

435
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:42,370
Rym: I think Satoshi khan is the only Anime director to have literally only hit home runs.

436
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,072
Scott: I think so.

437
00:22:43,132 --> 00:22:45,420
Scott: Even Miyazaki is sometimes hit non-home run.

438
00:22:45,420 --> 00:23:00,227
Scott: Well, you said Miyazaki which could include go And Tezuka is just the guy with so many at-bats that even though he strikes out sometimes his total numbers He's like how fast he's like.

439
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:01,453
Scott: he's like Cal Ripken, right?

440
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:02,035
Scott: He just goes.

441
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:03,040
Scott: he just keeps playing.

442
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:11,300
Rym: Yeah, yeah, but yeah, so the Boy and the Beast is actually two hours long.

443
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:18,700
Scott: Yeah, so this movie is like way long But on the one hand it's like you think something that's so long will get drawn out.

444
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:26,253
Scott: But no, it's like the pacing was like the biggest thing I noticed and the first thing I thought of when it was over Because it keeps moving along.

445
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:27,800
Scott: There's no point in which it drags.

446
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,227
Scott: There was a part where I thought it was gonna like Yeah suddenly become.

447
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:41,525
Scott: there's like this major point in the movie where it's like, okay Now we're going in a quest to visit all the Beast Kings and all the different Beast kingdoms, but BAM It was a montage.

448
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,333
Scott: They just breezed right over that and I'm like, is that?

449
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:46,680
Rym: and then my exactly like brave story.

450
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,360
Scott: And at first I thought it was gonna just be a traveling montage.

451
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:57,939
Scott: But no they montaged over every single right through all the Beast Kings and I'm like, whoa Now that is moving right along here.

452
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,320
Rym: We'll avoid spoilers at least till the end because it's anime.

453
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:00,977
Rym: We just go see it.

454
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:09,048
Rym: But the one thing I will say is this movie the trailers and all the stuff I saw at this point Didn't really tell you shit about what it was about.

455
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:09,489
Scott: No, I had.

456
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:13,060
Rym: no I couldn't and that's a good thing because it covers some ground.

457
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:14,183
Scott: Yeah, it goes.

458
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:21,851
Scott: it's like it keeps moving along at this pace and where you're not dragging on any one part for too long right.

459
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:37,488
Scott: and Just when I think this things like it's heading to the climax part like, you know 75% of the way through I didn't know how far we were in right, but it felt like okay Here's the climax the thing we've been waiting for since the beginning the battle to see who's gonna be the new You know Lord of the Beast Kingdom.

460
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:40,000
Scott: here it is and I'm like, wait a minute.

461
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,320
Scott: There's like this big thing that is an obvious foreshadow.

462
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,409
Scott: There's a Chekhov's gun that hasn't fired.

463
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:48,140
Scott: that has nothing to do with this Chekhov's well Moby Dick.

464
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:53,819
Scott: yeah, there's a Chekhov's character who hasn't resolved their deal and it won't be resolved in this climax part.

465
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,398
Scott: and This is being movies been going on for a long time

466
00:24:57,478 --> 00:25:04,435
Rym: now unlike Well constructed movies that Chekhov's characters gun like the I'm like character almost

467
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:13,440
Scott: felt like something that would be resolved in another Episode or another movie later and not this movie and I hadn't looked at a clock But it felt like it'd been going on so long.

468
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,579
Scott: I'm like it's got to end now.

469
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:24,288
Scott: but no that they kept going after that climax and fired that Chekhov's character and had the real the real climax after that and That character is one more act.

470
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:29,468
Rym: a less well done movie would have had a lot more telegraphing of what that was all gonna be about.

471
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:34,448
Rym: this one had a few context clues and Mostly it was.

472
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:35,537
Rym: it was Chekhov's back.

473
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:43,200
Scott: I don't know I don't know how many acts there were but at the end of the second to last act There was the climax and then the final act I didn't even know was gonna happen.

474
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,760
Rym: I thought that second last act was the last one but like in a bad movie that was like the characters holding the gun.

475
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:54,000
Rym: This was more like in Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf where the gun is on the mantle in the background.

476
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:57,697
Rym: You can see it there, but no one's saying anything about it.

477
00:25:57,938 --> 00:26:01,268
Scott: Yep Alright, so the deal with this movie this boy.

478
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:05,220
Scott: and there's a beast and the beast is awesome beast.

479
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:06,726
Rym: Okay, it's here.

480
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:08,092
Rym: He's from the land of beasts.

481
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:13,287
Scott: The Beast is basically Toshiro Mifune from Seven Samurai.

482
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:14,811
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

483
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:16,054
Scott: Right?

484
00:26:16,295 --> 00:26:31,069
Scott: Well then in mannerism in in Every aspect of this person Right and he's in the Beast Kingdom and he's competing to become the new Lord of the Beast Kingdom when they super awesome Current Lord of the Beast Kingdom is the best character.

485
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:32,252
Rym: Oh my god that rabbit.

486
00:26:32,714 --> 00:26:34,439
Scott: He's basically the grandma from summer wars.

487
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:44,438
Scott: He's got to compete against the also awesome, but opposite personality got beast Who's like a sort of a bore, right?

488
00:26:44,498 --> 00:26:50,880
Rym: Yeah Who is well a neat tidy organized a good person in every possible aspect?

489
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,980
Scott: Yeah, the other Sam, you know the lead samurai in the seven Sam, right?

490
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,120
Scott: Yeah, I forget his name, but he's a lot of Curaçao movies.

491
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,640
Scott: But anyway, so they're gonna compete to become you know, the new Lord of the Beast Kingdom.

492
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,979
Rym: But anyway, so independently next to all this is Tokyo Japan modern-day Japan and a kid runs away from home.

493
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:09,651
Scott: Well, so the kid doesn't just run away from home, right?

494
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:10,616
Scott: His parents are dead.

495
00:27:10,636 --> 00:27:19,626
Scott: He's good He's living with like some step pair, you know some like mom's Parents or so his family's rich Sure, but he's a family.

496
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:21,334
Scott: He doesn't like that doesn't like him right?

497
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:26,260
Scott: It's almost a oh What the hell was that anime that's good, but then becomes perverted.

498
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:30,178
Scott: What is it one with the that still doesn't narrow down.

499
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:35,037
Scott: no He is the girl who's like grandpa's daughter and he adopts her.

500
00:27:35,057 --> 00:27:36,703
Rym: Oh We did.

501
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:39,513
Rym: we reviewed it on anime Boston.

502
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,059
Rym: Yeah in the end they sex.

503
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:44,491
Scott: Well, yeah, but that's in the manga and I stopped watching buddy.

504
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:45,855
Scott: Yeah, yeah bunny drop, right?

505
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:46,537
Scott: It's like others.

506
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:47,200
Rym: they sex.

507
00:27:47,441 --> 00:27:50,620
Scott: Yeah, it's a bunny drop situation without the sex part.

508
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:56,100
Scott: Right only runs away from home instead of living with this family that doesn't really care about him that much.

509
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,380
Scott: They they seem to want to take care of him.

510
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,880
Scott: They're like, oh you'll be taken care of and whatever but doesn't seem like there's any love or caring in that relationship.

511
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:10,640
Rym: right runs away and has a little bit of Personal drama around that in shades of perhaps nurse little Kayla Gwynn novel.

512
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:15,540
Rym: So he stumbles into the Beast Kingdom and but it's just on the other side of an alley from Tokyo.

513
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:21,197
Scott: Yeah, and the Beast Kingdom is a metaphorical kingdom, but it's also a totally literal Kingdom.

514
00:28:21,337 --> 00:28:22,260
Scott: It's a literal place.

515
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,794
Rym: Now that is actually literally my favorite part of this movie.

516
00:28:26,814 --> 00:28:28,660
Scott: Yeah, you thought you could have easily done this.

517
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,125
Scott: We're like, oh, it's a hallucination.

518
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:31,530
Scott: Oh, it's it's.

519
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,320
Scott: um, what's the movie with the guy in the boat with the tiger?

520
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,803
Rym: Life up high.

521
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:39,220
Scott: Yeah, where the whole thing's a metaphor and he wasn't really on a boat with a tiger, right?

522
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,140
Rym: One could argue that he was sure right metaphorical.

523
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:57,753
Scott: This is literally yes There is a Beast Kingdom and a real Tokyo of modern day and they both really exist for real and Hosanna goes out of his Way to make sure you cannot interpret this as anything.

524
00:28:57,814 --> 00:28:59,919
Rym: but this is the literal reality.

525
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:06,824
Scott: now You can't be like, oh the Beast Kingdom was just like a dream for like and it was a metaphor for the orphanage He was in or something.

526
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:07,085
Scott: It's like.

527
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,371
Scott: no there was a Beast Kingdom.

528
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:10,360
Scott: He was raised by this beast, right?

529
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,139
Scott: He was the beasts, uh, you know, what's it called?

530
00:29:14,081 --> 00:29:15,005
Scott: Student student.

531
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:17,655
Rym: Yeah, you're you're forgetting every written words tonight.

532
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:18,197
Scott: Yeah words.

533
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:18,880
Scott: It's warm out.

534
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:24,180
Scott: I'm not thinking about being in here doing a podcast but instead of like it is literally the reality.

535
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,880
Rym: But that literal reality of this animated world is itself heavy allegory.

536
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:31,580
Scott: The word was a student is apprentice, right?

537
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:38,360
Scott: Yeah, the Beast needs apprentices to like, you know become the Lord of beasts, which he wants to be for some reason.

538
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:39,900
Scott: That's the one part that's confusing.

539
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:41,346
Scott: Why does he want to be the Lord of beasts?

540
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:44,539
Rym: you feel like he wants to be because he's expected to want to be.

541
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:46,327
Rym: I think he doesn't want to get shown up.

542
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:49,240
Scott: Yeah, I think it's mostly he just wants to fight the other guy and Wayne.

543
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:53,770
Scott: I don't think he actually wants to be the Lord of the beats And no one else seems to want him to be either.

544
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,939
Scott: The other guy would actually probably be a better Lord.

545
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:59,235
Rym: The same time they're all kind of anyway, you know, it's interesting.

546
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:02,257
Rym: the Beast world basically perfect.

547
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,710
Rym: Yeah, basically like no one appears to want for anything.

548
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:08,637
Rym: Everyone's happy all the time.

549
00:30:08,677 --> 00:30:11,088
Rym: as far as you can tell It's almost a Miyazaki thing, right?

550
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:17,091
Scott: We're like the place that is low-tech is And you know is all traditional is all happy and peaceful.

551
00:30:17,112 --> 00:30:19,098
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's sort of like a dr.

552
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:19,760
Scott: Seuss thing, too.

553
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,205
Scott: It's like oh, yeah the place with the factory that eats up all the tough of the trees is bad in the place You know same deal.

554
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,574
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time that's a magic.

555
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:29,080
Scott: land is all happy and perfect life.

556
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:30,774
Scott: And the human world has darkness.

557
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:38,840
Rym: Yeah Well, well human cell phone because humans have darkness inherent in them and beasts do not have similar inherent darkness.

558
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,371
Scott: But I guess the human world has light in the library.

559
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:47,850
Scott: The library is a nice place in the human world Yeah, but it's hard to without because they're.

560
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:49,475
Rym: this movie covers so much ground.

561
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:50,980
Rym: you really should just see it.

562
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:53,363
Rym: Yeah and I don't want to get into Why.

563
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:59,262
Rym: it's important that the human world and the beast world are both literal realities and how that ties into Pretty much.

564
00:30:59,302 --> 00:31:12,299
Scott: what you can expect from this movie is you know, the awesome sort of general apprentice Adventure kind of thing with you know, the you know, the apprentice being better than the master in some ways and whatnot?

565
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:18,580
Scott: learning You know, but the mat the master while being goofy is also, you know wise in other ways, right?

566
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:24,060
Scott: You know pretty typical expected sort of relationship there, you know growing up thing.

567
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:29,417
Scott: But then once grown up, you know resolving of plots that were there.

568
00:31:29,497 --> 00:31:35,514
Scott: since you know The beginning part it's like aha you actually it wasn't just the girl up.

569
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:36,617
Scott: end of movie.

570
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:39,143
Scott: you're grown up now Congratulations.

571
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:40,448
Scott: It was you grew up.

572
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:43,540
Scott: now you can do the quest and we have time so we're gonna fucking do it.

573
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:53,616
Rym: Yeah so the movie is despite also being very serious and having very heavy allegory that Full disclosure might be a little too close to home for some people in the audience.

574
00:31:53,997 --> 00:32:00,630
Rym: Oh It is also legitimately Outright hilarious at points.

575
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:02,320
Rym: It is a really funny movie.

576
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:08,880
Scott: Just and Bennett's the humor is and they don't stop the humor until that very final act right right up.

577
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,923
Scott: But even that climax I talked about in the second to last act still has humors in it But it's clever like.

578
00:32:13,943 --> 00:32:19,100
Rym: the humor reminds me actually of a lot of those Mufune type samurai movies that like that kind of humor.

579
00:32:19,582 --> 00:32:20,144
Rym: A lot of it is.

580
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:23,960
Scott: well a lot of the humor comes from the monkey guy and the monk.

581
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:27,034
Rym: Well, like there's the moment and he's like, what should I call you?

582
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:28,320
Rym: Well, you're nine years old, right?

583
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,625
Rym: I'll call you cute.

584
00:32:29,826 --> 00:32:30,890
Rym: Ah, right you're not.

585
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:40,429
Scott: and there's also these three sort of Like these guys that are sort of like these side characters way out like double side characters But they're basically the exact same characters.

586
00:32:40,489 --> 00:32:42,256
Scott: is the three old guys in cowboy beep-boop.

587
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:42,738
Rym: Yep.

588
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:48,220
Scott: Yep Okay, there's 100% and they provide some humor humorous interjections as well, right?

589
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:57,299
Rym: But there's clever humor constantly and the Beast Lord is never not funny He's pretty much a hundred percent funny, I mean everyone's great I don't.

590
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,566
Rym: Movie is just delightful.

591
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:01,053
Scott: There's not a lot of humor in the human world.

592
00:33:01,154 --> 00:33:04,378
Scott: It's not a funny place true It's a place where kids are orphaned, right?

593
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:20,120
Rym: But the overall when I guess you know the whole literal reality of it What makes the movie go from just being really enjoyable and delightful to being I think a really good movie Is that the allegory is very well presented and the allegory primarily has to do with you know?

594
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,951
Rym: nature versus nurture?

595
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:23,565
Rym: to a degree Who is your family?

596
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:27,437
Rym: You know the the combination of blood versus who raised you?

597
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:28,240
Rym: how do you like?

598
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,062
Rym: What is the difference?

599
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:31,431
Rym: the relationship with an estranged family member?

600
00:33:31,732 --> 00:33:32,154
Rym: Perhaps?

601
00:33:32,414 --> 00:33:33,920
Rym: How do you start that up to?

602
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,374
Rym: How do you carry the memory of perhaps lost family members in your heart?

603
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,940
Rym: And how does that change you as a person?

604
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,860
Rym: How do you show compassion to people who had a different upbringing that left darkness in their heart?

605
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,360
Rym: Right literal darkness in this case that turns into psychic death powers.

606
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:53,261
Scott: It also covers the same topics that like 50% of Japanese movies I've seen.

607
00:33:53,362 --> 00:33:59,560
Scott: cover which is like should you live as you've been expected to live by your parents in society or live your own life?

608
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,625
Scott: and taking tests And all those sorts of things right You know?

609
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:08,900
Scott: should you be that you know person who has all your shit together?

610
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,159
Scott: You?

611
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:12,460
Scott: should you be that wild person you know who lets loose yep?

612
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:13,583
Rym: And it's it.

613
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:20,494
Rym: very elegantly takes all these different allegorical threads and Weaves them together into one story.

614
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:21,500
Scott: one coherent story.

615
00:34:21,543 --> 00:34:31,292
Rym: Yeah One all over the place story like a really coherent story like it comes around full circle in the end Almost shockingly because of how long it was and how many threads that opened.

616
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:33,780
Rym: it's kind of amazing to see them all collapse back together.

617
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,869
Scott: Yep, the animations are like top tier.

618
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:39,356
Rym: Oh those fights the fight scenes right.

619
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:43,188
Scott: the only thing I got to say though is all the animations were the top tier.

620
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:50,831
Scott: I say some of the drawings like the Backgrounds were the second tier because like for example the clouds.

621
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:52,155
Scott: They're not you know.

622
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:53,958
Scott: They're not the top tier class.

623
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,826
Scott: Right we know who we're thinking it.

624
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:57,769
Rym: What's up?

625
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,535
Rym: certain centimeters per second clouds.

626
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:01,200
Scott: We know who makes the best clouds.

627
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,965
Rym: I promise no early days clouds.

628
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,791
Scott: These are the second best class.

629
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:07,940
Scott: all right you know, but yeah the animation is still incredible right?

630
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:11,611
Scott: You know it looks like they drew it with computers, but it's still 2d.

631
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:12,033
Scott: It's not.

632
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:16,776
Scott: it's not a CGs in any way All right, so are you looking for these clouds?

633
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:17,319
Rym: Yeah?

634
00:35:18,142 --> 00:35:18,804
Rym: Clouds right there.

635
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:20,770
Rym: look at that one the real clouds right.

636
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:23,258
Scott: yeah, so you know you know it's.

637
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,740
Scott: it's pretty much You know the best 2d animations you're gonna see from Japan.

638
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:32,993
Scott: It doesn't look like a Ghibli movie But it looks as good as it's gonna be just in a different style than Ghibli style.

639
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:37,559
Rym: right I did really enjoy the style because Actually because of the Beast world.

640
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:43,340
Scott: But and they did with the human beast world in the human world have totally different styles right and totally different colors.

641
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:49,840
Scott: But every character in the world is totally dark usually even like and they don't really go to the human world a lot during daytime.

642
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:55,240
Scott: Very rarely do they go to the human world during daytime and usually it's like really tight shots.

643
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,068
Scott: So it'll be you know poorly lit or like.

644
00:35:57,108 --> 00:36:01,596
Scott: you'll see the Sun going down and in the Beast world It seems like it's just like always.

645
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:02,364
Scott: daytime I don't.

646
00:36:02,384 --> 00:36:13,360
Scott: you don't see a lot of night shots But it's usually indoors with candles and stuff and lights on in the Beast world at night It's you don't see a lot of like dark places in the Beast world.

647
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,060
Scott: They're not going around in caves or anything like that right even when it becomes nighttime.

648
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:22,340
Scott: It's like a well-lit festival kind of atmosphere all the time and bright colors.

649
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,343
Rym: But that style let him.

650
00:36:23,544 --> 00:36:31,920
Rym: every single character is deeply distinct both in personality and appearance Which actually lets the characters be very strong?

651
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:45,422
Rym: Which actually is one of the things that really pushes the movie forward and prevents it from sort of For a movie this long with this kind of subject matter like Scott said it feels like it's on the edge of dragging Every second and then it always Steers.

652
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:48,873
Scott: you feel like something's gonna be dragging out, but they don't I know.

653
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:55,533
Scott: the reason they can avoid dragging is Usually they'd be like a lot of movies will like have unexplained things.

654
00:36:55,814 --> 00:37:00,432
Scott: right this and this movie Just bothers not to make things questionable.

655
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,138
Scott: see they're not left unexplained.

656
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:05,620
Scott: for example You just goes to this Beast world right in another movie.

657
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,875
Scott: You might think how is the Beast world in the human world connected?

658
00:37:08,955 --> 00:37:10,020
Scott: I need to know more about this.

659
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,889
Scott: This doesn't make a lot of sense, but in this movie.

660
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,320
Scott: It's like beasts and humans to just go back and forth.

661
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,594
Scott: It's like a physical tunnel you just to walk through it or something whatever and you don't.

662
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:23,059
Scott: you're not questioning that right It's just there, and it's not like a mystery.

663
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:27,635
Scott: So because it's not a mystery you don't need to dedicate any time to explaining it.

664
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,770
Scott: you just show it happening And you're done.

665
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:37,795
Scott: yep And by doing it does that with like a whole bunch of different things So that you only things you're thinking about are like these core plots that they're gonna spend.

666
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:40,987
Scott: actually you know dedicate Seconds of you know film to.

667
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:43,897
Rym: so so if I had any complaint about this movie at all.

668
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:50,583
Rym: it would be that The dialogue in the fourth fifth of the movie like before the climax But kind of ab.

669
00:37:50,804 --> 00:38:05,680
Rym: so after the fight and the sort of big like game-changing moving to the end of the movie event and The actual end there's this middle part where a lot of characters spend a lot of time sort of explaining things to each other.

670
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:14,339
Rym: and That is the only time in the movie where it sort of did the characters talking as opposed to just showing you something and letting You smart enough to figure it out.

671
00:38:15,023 --> 00:38:18,919
Scott: And there's a lot of like it felt like a lot of the things they were saying didn't matter or they were repeating.

672
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:27,468
Rym: the same People complain that oh the dub must have been a bad script because the characters kept repeating themselves and like we're saying sort of inane Or obvious thing.

673
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:28,698
Scott: we didn't see the dub by the way.

674
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:31,450
Rym: yes But I saw that sentiment from multiple people.

675
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,916
Scott: it is it has been dubbed.

676
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:33,800
Scott: so if you see it in the u.s.

677
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,413
Scott: It might be dubbed.

678
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:42,696
Rym: yep But I didn't know that at least in the subtitled version that we saw those same scenes Just as draggy kind of pointless dialogue.

679
00:38:42,716 --> 00:38:52,254
Scott: right like he goes sees He sees the girl in the library, and then he sees her again And I think he sees her like I can't remember how many times But they pretty much what feels like they had the same conversation every time right?

680
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,800
Scott: yeah, it didn't feel like they were Advancing much other than okay.

681
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:58,925
Scott: They saw each other again But yet the movie did.

682
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:03,343
Rym: other aspects like the other four fifths of the movie Did the read.

683
00:39:03,363 --> 00:39:08,958
Rym: they really did a good job of showing and not having a character explain it like the Chekhov's gun character who is?

684
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,668
Rym: Obviously a human Like but nothing is said about that.

685
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,554
Rym: the characters just doing just thing.

686
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:22,878
Rym: and then there's one scene Where that character is older and his brother is like futzing with his tusks cuz he knows a born.

687
00:39:22,938 --> 00:39:23,560
Rym: is this real toss?

688
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,679
Rym: He's just kind of futzing with it, and it cuts to him, and he's kind of covering his mouth with the scarf.

689
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:37,397
Rym: And I told you literally everything you needed to know about the characters their interactions the gun Chekhov is hanging out there in that tooth.

690
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,466
Rym: and Then the rest of the movie.

691
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:43,940
Rym: it was characters explaining to you where the guns were and when they were gonna go off and why?

692
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:44,889
Rym: Mm-hmm.

693
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:48,820
Scott: So yeah, I mean if this is playing anywhere near you go see it.

694
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,708
Scott: If not, it'll be on DVD way soon.

719
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:59,355
Rym: Recognized where it came from what it was what I was referencing Last several no one said anything about.

720
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:02,559

723
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:25,195
Rym: But anyway that aside I'm gonna do just a weird fun thing because you guys seem really some of you are really into changing your names To mess with me in the patron manager, so what I'm gonna.

727
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:39,612
Rym: Hopefully a small number.

728
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:52,560
Rym: if you put any too many words in there I will just ignore them, and I will probably just read Everything you've submitted in order that you submitted them from start to finish.

729
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:58,737
Rym: I'm gonna figure out exactly what the details of this are gonna be and we'll see how amazingly dumb.
