1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,869
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 7th, 2023.

2
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:10,110
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:13,657
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,004
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:19,339
Rym: Tonight we are talking about Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,398
Scott: Let's do this!

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,680
Rym: So, uh, you didn't look at the news and you don't live in the entire northeast of the United States or, like, eastern Canada.

8
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:39,320
Rym: You might not realize that, uh, shit's on fire and New York City was covered in a, like, black and orange cloud of death all day today.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,500
Scott: The AQI right now is 364.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,097
Rym: That is at the levels where, like, it is harmful to health and life.

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:55,860
Scott: According to AirNow.gov, a level of 301 says everyone should stay indoors and reduce activity levels.

12
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:56,741
Rym: Yup.

13
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:08,280
Rym: I mean, up until this point, the worst AQI I've ever experienced in my life was during a particularly bad burn in Malaysia while I was in Singapore during F1, like, a decade or more ago.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,561
Rym: And it was around 400, 450.

15
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:24,020
Rym: And when I stepped outside of my hotel, I literally collapsed into an uncontrolled coughing fit and had to stagger back into the hotel and could not leave my hotel for a couple days.

16
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:30,680
Scott: I'm just saying, like, I'm trying to, the thing that astonishes me is that, like, okay, let's say you got a campfire, right?

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,894
Scott: And it's like, you can't stand downwind of the campfire.

18
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:33,740
Scott: You'd be like, huh, right?

19
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:38,000
Scott: That's probably, like, AQI of a few hundred, right?

20
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:41,300
Rym: But you can walk around the campfire to get away from it.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,300
Scott: And it doesn't, you don't have to walk that far away from the campfire before it's basically nothing anymore, right?

22
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,180
Scott: It's like, you gotta get pretty close to, like, a charcoal grill to actually smell it, right?

23
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:56,160
Scott: So, the fires in Canada are so numerous and so large.

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,280
Rym: They said something like 90 million acres have been ruined to ash.

25
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:13,260
Scott: Right, so it's like, if you are in this huge, huge area, right, like, you know, an enormous area like the entire, like, northeast of North America, right?

26
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,499
Rym: The sheer tens of millions of people affected by this.

27
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:23,759
Scott: But it's like, anywhere in that area, it's still, like, campfire strength, right?

28
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:28,428
Scott: So, I cracked- I'm hundreds of miles away, it's still campfire strength.

29
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:32,920
Scott: What could it possibly be if you're right next to it, like, you're right next to a campfire?

30
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,986
Rym: So, you know what that is?

31
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,100
Rym: You know what that is if you were near these fires?

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,860
Rym: Because remember, my father was a firefighter, his father was a firefighter, and his other was a firefighter.

33
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:45,620
Rym: I am the first non-firefighter in my family as far back as we know on my dad's side.

34
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:48,186
Rym: And, uh, I know a lot about fires.

35
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:54,180
Rym: If you're that close to that type of air quality, that is what kills most people in fires.

36
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,706
Rym: Very few people are killed by heat or by burning.

37
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:59,011
Rym: They are killed by that air.

38
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,557
Rym: The air is just deadly to life.

39
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:02,660
Rym: Full stop.

40
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,380
Scott: So, it's, uh, yeah, it's pretty bad.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,369
Rym: This is a horrific, deadly situation.

42
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,040
Rym: People are definitely dying, and we're going to find out about it later.

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Rym: Like, this is an absolute disaster, and it might not get a lot better in the foreseeable future because Canada doesn't really have a good way to control these fires.

44
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:32,600
Rym: Uh, they are spending all of their resources right now just trying to fight the fires that are approaching settlements and housing and infrastructure.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,459
Rym: Most of the fires are so remote that they can't even easily get to them.

46
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:43,258
Scott: So, I think what we've got to do is, here's the thing, people are like, "Oh, oh, big fan,

47
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:43,459
Scott: nuke.".

48
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,203
Scott: Hold on.

49
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,515
Scott: The people are like,

50
00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:45,736
Scott: "Hey."

51
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,320
Scott: Van Kars?

52
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:47,323
Scott: No.

53
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:48,820
Scott: Well, I mean, that doesn't hurt.

54
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:53,187
Scott: The people are like, "Oh, these fires, they're caused by climate change,".

55
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:59,720
Scott: because it dried everything out, and then lightning hit the trees, and then it doesn't rain, and you have a problem, right?

56
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:01,143
Scott: But you know what?

57
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:09,260
Scott: Climate change can also be the answer, because if we melt the ice caps, the water will flood all of Canada, and then they can't set on fire.

58
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,545
Scott: So, right?

59
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:13,731
Scott: The problem is also the solution.

60
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:17,000
Scott: We're just in this non-equilibrium state right now.

61
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:19,404
Rym: We don't have enough.

62
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:25,120
Scott: We can have less climate change, and it would be problem-solved, but more climate change would also be problem-solved.

63
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:29,640
Rym: Yeah, Waterworld definitely portrayed a healthy quality of life for all the people involved.

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,547
Scott: Listen, Waterworld, whatever you want to say about it, was not on fire.

65
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:35,652
Scott: The air quality was good.

66
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:39,440
Scott: You could breathe on Waterworld above the water.

67
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:45,691
Scott: Not under the water, but if you had your head above the water in Waterworld, at least you could breathe.

68
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,419
Scott: You know, drinking, eating, those are problems, but breathing.

69
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:57,400
Rym: But the worst part is, no one can say- Would you rather live on Waterworld, or only Landworld?

70
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,020
Rym: Yeah, I mean, both of them just kill everybody.

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,873
Scott: Only Landworld.

72
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:03,358
Scott: Land only.

73
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:11,260
Rym: I feel like I would like the largest and most powerful things that have ever existed, which are human governments, to do something about this.

74
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,747
Scott: I mean, they are doing.

75
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,519
Scott: They have the resources that they have.

76
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,725
Rym: Well, I mean, out of grander scale.

77
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:18,869
Rym: They're not doing something about climate change.

78
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,560
Rym: They're doing the bare minimum to prevent people from just rioting about it.

79
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,399
Rym: And half the people don't even believe it's real.

80
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:28,179
Scott: Oh, it depends where you are.

81
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,520
Rym: Yeah, but if you average it out, a lot of people don't believe any of this is real.

82
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,189
Rym: But this is deadly, and we don't know when it's going to end.

83
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,875
Rym: No one can forecast this, because the fires aren't slowing down.

84
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:40,980
Rym: More fires are likely to start.

85
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:51,920
Rym: And for us, in the New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut area, the only thing that determines how bad it gets for us is which jet stream is active.

86
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,660
Rym: And because climate change has fucked up all the models for weather patterns, it can't really be predicted.

87
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,940
Rym: So if the jet stream comes from the east, it'll actually keep the smoke away from us, and our air will go back to normal.

88
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:10,733
Rym: If it comes down and across like it is now, the wind doesn't blow the smoke away.

89
00:06:10,814 --> 00:06:13,560
Rym: It literally just brings more and more and more smoke.

90
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:24,700
Rym: But if fires start in Pennsylvania, which are very likely because very similar conditions exist there, including something that if you've never heard of it that's terrifying, called a dry thunderstorm, which is bad news bears.

91
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,500
Scott: Doesn't Pennsylvania still have the town where the coal is on fire?

92
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,094
Rym: Oh yeah, that town's still on fire.

93
00:06:29,115 --> 00:06:29,619
Rym: Centralia.

94
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:30,738
Scott: Okay.

95
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:36,180
Rym: That fire is nothing compared to what's going on up in Canada right now.

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,040
Scott: Well, obviously, otherwise we'd smell it, right?

97
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,009
Rym: So this is affecting GeekNights, actually, because I stayed home all day.

98
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,520
Rym: We live in a building that has really good air filtration, and we have a bunch of giant HEPA filters.

99
00:06:50,221 --> 00:07:00,395
Rym: But despite that, and literally not going outside at all and running all these filters at max, since yesterday, my throat hurts, my eyes hurt.

100
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,037
Rym: Like, I am tired.

101
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:03,299
Rym: I can smell burning.

102
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,380
Rym: This sucks.

103
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,203
Scott: Yeah, it's like yesterday.

104
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:08,229
Scott: it was like, "Ooh, that's bad, right?

105
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:09,954
Scott: Wear a mask when you go outside.

106
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:11,580
Scott: You know, don't go outside too

107
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,700
Scott: much.".

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,780
Rym: Today is literally don't go outside unless it is an absolute emergency.

109
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:18,565
Scott: Today is, like, way, way worse.

110
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,490
Scott: I didn't realize it was gonna get so, like, twice as bad.

111
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,135
Scott: Like, yesterday I could see the World Trade Center.

112
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:24,936
Scott: It was a little blurry.

113
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:27,220
Scott: I could see the Empire State Building, no problem, right?

114
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,411
Scott: Today, the Empire State Building is gone.

115
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:31,040
Scott: World Trade Center, gone.

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,693
Rym: Yeah, I was in a meeting earlier today, like, for work.

117
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:34,940
Rym: I was presenting this big thing.

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,599
Scott: The visibility is, like, half.

119
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:48,477
Rym: Just toward the end of the presentation, it suddenly, like, over the course of about a minute, got so dark that I assumed, like, a huge cloud came over or something.

120
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:50,280
Rym: I didn't think much about it because I was focused on my work.

121
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:52,463
Rym: And it just kept getting dark and dark.

122
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:56,150
Rym: And finally my meeting ends and I stand up and, like, go look behind the screen behind me.

123
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,476
Rym: And it's just orange outside.

124
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:02,020
Rym: Like, this deep orange like I'm wearing sunglasses.

125
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:03,141
Scott: Yep.

126
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:06,867
Scott: Yeah, it was orange for a little bit today, around, like, two-ish.

127
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:12,336
Scott: But then it just, it stayed, you know, the visibility kept declining, but the orange became white again.

128
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:14,420
Scott: So I don't know what causes the color change.

129
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:24,357
Rym: Ah, so that is caused by the angle of the sun and the relative amounts of the different sizes of particles in different layers of the local atmosphere.

130
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:25,840
Rym: Again, firefighter dad.

131
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:31,120
Scott: So I guess at two o'clock the sun angle made it be orange, but then not anymore at three.

132
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,559
Rym: But also the density of certain particles might have been different and the air might have been static for a while.

133
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,202
Scott: I don't know.

134
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:38,044
Scott: It's just getting real.

135
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:39,330
Scott: It was, it's still getting worse.

136
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,736
Scott: It hasn't gotten better since two.

137
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:41,700
Scott: It just got less orange.

138
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,020
Rym: Yeah.

139
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:53,200
Rym: So I guess what I'd say is if the AQI, which you can look up in most places around you or in the place you are for the foreseeable future, is above a hundred.

140
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:56,686
Rym: Now, above 50 is already not great for people.

141
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,509
Rym: Like, that is already a problem.

142
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:04,780
Rym: But if it's above a hundred, I am earnestly imploring you to not go outside if you can avoid it.

143
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,088
Rym: And if it's above 200, don't even, like, work out or, like, exercise or even do anything strenuous indoors.

144
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:22,880
Rym: Like, do as little as possible because particulate matter, these 2.5, this PM 2.5 metric, those are particles so fine that it's not just like they get in your lungs and make you cough.

145
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:25,760
Rym: They can cause permanent damage to your lungs.

146
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:26,541
Scott: Yeah.

147
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:31,840
Scott: It's like if you go outside today, it's like that might as well be the same as, like, deciding to start smoking tobacco.

148
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,560
Rym: Probably worse because of the sheer density and the fact that your lungs don't get a break.

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,870
Scott: Well, and the fact that, yeah, if you smoke cigarettes, it's like you do that.

150
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,760
Scott: Even if you're a chain smoker, you do that a few times a day.

151
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,206
Rym: This is not like smoking a pack of cigarettes.

152
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:52,040
Rym: This is like every single breath you take is through three cigarettes simultaneously all day.

153
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,060
Scott: Yeah.

154
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,980
Rym: This is like Donald Duck smoking those cigarettes in that one Disney cartoon.

155
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:00,870
Rym: Like, this is rough and...

156
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:18,700
Scott: One thing that does bother me, though, is that, you know, when the AQI is bad, right, I guess, you know, in this situation, it's a little different, but when the AQI is bad, the warnings are always, like, don't go outside, don't exercise, don't go biking, don't go walking, don't go running, right?

157
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:20,904
Scott: And it's like, you know, those are true.

158
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,709
Scott: You shouldn't do those things because you'll mess yourself up, right?

159
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,300
Scott: But when the AQI is bad, shouldn't they say don't drive, no cars right now?

160
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,100
Scott: Well, so if... I mean, in this situation, cars are a drop in the bucket.

161
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:43,260
Rym: Well, so they did because there is a line when it gets to the red and purple areas, which a lot of people learned about the purple and maroon colors that they've never seen before on those charts.

162
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:51,600
Rym: But when it's above 200, then yes, the advice actually is do not go anywhere under any circumstances.

163
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,084
Scott: Right, but it's not about just going anywhere.

164
00:10:54,144 --> 00:11:00,560
Scott: It's like, you know, they should... anything that burns anything, right, should just be like, all right, everyone stop burning things.

165
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:10,255
Rym: In China and Singapore and even in other countries, yes, like in China, in many regions, when the AQI is above a certain point, there is a ban on barbecuing food.

166
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,580
Rym: Like, there is a ban on certain people driving.

167
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:23,099
Scott: Whereas in New York, the AQI was bad yesterday and we saw a fire on a roof that we don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure a fire on a roof in a fancy building like that is likely a grill fire.

168
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:33,175
Rym: I'm going to go to put it on record because I could be wrong, but based on the video and the photos I saw of that fire, I am very confident, like 80% confident.

169
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:36,460
Rym: that was a gas grill that caught fire and set all the things on fire.

170
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,215
Scott: It's definitely the most likely explanation because it was a fancy building with a fire on the roof.

171
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:41,138
Scott: What else would burn up there?

172
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:54,015
Rym: There was a bright yellow concentrated fire and a darker, like, orangish fire around it and there was a concentrated plume of white smoke and a separate, more diffuse plume of black smoke.

173
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,680
Rym: That tells me gas fire was secondary adjacent wood fires.

174
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,652
Scott: Maybe, but the point is, people were grilling.

175
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:08,380
Scott: Even if that person wasn't grilling, there was definitely grilling going on in New York yesterday.

176
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,144
Rym: The AQI is above 200 in New York City.

177
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:18,220
Rym: There should be, just like during a Blizzard A, you will get a ticket if you're driving your car and you are not going to the hospital because there's an emergency.

178
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:41,409
Scott: Yeah, like literally anything that has an exhaust should be temporarily banned in this situation because even though it's a minuscule improvement over, you know, considering- People are outside hurting themselves and I don't think people realize.

179
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,857
Rym: I saw people, like, jogging outside.

180
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:44,760
Rym: Like, what the fuck?

181
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,848
Scott: Yeah, no, I think people, I don't know what people are thinking.

182
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,030
Scott: They just don't read news.

183
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,657
Scott: The whole thing is, you can see this hell happening outside.

184
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:56,100
Scott: They just don't even recognize it.

185
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,980
Scott: They look at their phone only and they don't smell anything.

186
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:09,420
Rym: My guess, based on the people I have talked to today, I would guess that less than 10% of all adults in New York have ever heard of AQI before.

187
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:15,875
Scott: So, yeah, this is- But they don't notice, they look out the window and they say, "Oh, that's

188
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:16,217
Scott: normal.".

189
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,896
Rym: Yeah, I mean, a friend was just talking about someone they knew who was just complaining about like, "Oh, the smog's really bad.

190
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,340
Rym: Like, why doesn't the city do something about

191
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,440
Rym: this?".

192
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,160
Rym: They're like, "Buddy, that's-".

193
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,810
Scott: "Buddy, did you see the mayor this morning?

194
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,299
Scott: He's a shitty mayor, but like-".

195
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,744
Rym: Like, even the shitty mayor.

196
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:35,320
Rym: Like, that fucked up, mostly broken clock is right three or four times a day.

197
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,857
Scott: Yeah, that mayor was like, "Oh shit, emergency situation.

198
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:39,078
Scott: Let's

199
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:39,219
Scott: go.".

200
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,078
Rym: Yeah, he's pro-bike lane and now he's like, "Yo, don't fucking go

201
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:43,380
Rym: outside.".

202
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,360
Scott: Yeah, he says he's pro-bike lane, but he hasn't delivered on his bike lane promises.

203
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,740
Rym: Yeah, well, the bike lanes are progressing more than they were before, but- The point is, it's like, why doesn't the city do something about this?

204
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,800
Scott: There was a huge emergency press conference this morning with a whole thing going on.

205
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,620
Rym: The city's doing a lot, most of what it can, but the city could go further.

206
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,820
Rym: We should say everyone should work from home like COVID times until this is resolved.

207
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,360
Scott: We should sue Canada for damages.

208
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,843
Rym: Yeah, of course.

209
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:14,940
Rym: Arguably, the fires in Canada are being caused by climate change, and you know who's causing climate change?

210
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,285
Rym: You know who are the biggest offenders?

211
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:32,639
Rym: Meat production, particularly beef, cars, and underdeveloped countries who arguably are using practices that are the best they have available because more developed countries will not share their technology and help them.

212
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,240
Scott: Well, we can at least force the first two to pay for it.

213
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,968
Rym: Yes, we should sue beef.

214
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,640
Rym: Literally, it's not even just meat, it is beef.

215
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,180
Rym: Beef causes a huge percentage of all of this.

216
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:53,680
Rym: If we just reduced human beef consumption by like 20%, that would materially impact climate change even more so than heavily restricting cars.

217
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:56,250
Rym: Like, the solut- This is the-.

218
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:13,859
Rym: I guess we gotta move on to the rest of the show, and this is a Wednesday, but it always bothers me when it's not that the solutions are easy, but there are obvious, relatively straightforward, objectively achievable ways to mitigate problems at a wide scale, and we as a collective human society can't even do that.

219
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:17,371
Rym: Alright, and some animation news!

220
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:18,499
Rym: There's a ton going on.

221
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:27,220
Rym: So, you know, Hayao Miyazaki's presumably last film, this is what- His last, last, last for real this time, guys.

222
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,196
Rym: Final, final, final, one, two, three, dot, mv4.

223
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,560
Scott: This thing is coming out next month.

224
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:33,656
Scott: July 14th in theaters.

225
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:41,360
Scott: I thought he was gonna die and just keep improving it and polishing it until he died, and then it would just- ought to be released in whatever form it was in at the time.

226
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,699
Scott: I didn't know when it was coming out!

227
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:48,600
Scott: But I guess- no, I guess- I guess he's releasing it, and he's alive, despite chainsmoking his whole life.

228
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:53,477
Rym: So, uh, I noticed this news because it was like, "How do you live?

229
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:53,999
Rym: We'll not have a

230
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,340
Rym: trailer.".

231
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,887
Rym: And I was like, "Oh, that's interesting,".

232
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,660
Rym: and I skimmed this article, and read the article.

233
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,520
Rym: I'm not gonna read the whole thing to you, you've just gotta read it.

234
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:09,140
Rym: There's- This is densely packed with buried leaves and fascinating things, but basically, the article is about why there is no trailer.

235
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,580
Rym: Uh, Ghibli, they are not going to release a trailer, or even a plot synopsis.

236
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,160
Rym: The movie is just going to appear in theaters.

237
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,660
Scott: It's based on a book that you can read, it's available in English.

238
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,300
Scott: It may be a book club book one day, I don't know, right?

239
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,500
Scott: But it's like, it's based on- you don't need to make a trailer for something when there's a book.

240
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
Scott: Anyone can just read the book and be able to plot.

241
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:40,540
Rym: Or even better, so the producer at Ghibli, Toshio Suzuki, gave an interview where he actually talked about this a lot, and he basically said they are- him and Miyazaki are done with full-blown marketing cycles.

242
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,560
Rym: They don't have the energy for it anymore.

243
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,651
Rym: Quote, "You get tired of doing the same thing over and over.

244
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:46,937
Rym: We wanted to try something new this

245
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:47,198
Rym: time.".

246
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:50,080
Rym: Uh, but he went further and said something I think is really important.

247
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:57,517
Rym: He remarked, and I'm quoting the article now, "If audiences are interested in watching something, they don't need to see trailers to be

248
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,019
Rym: convinced.".

249
00:16:59,321 --> 00:16:59,803
Rym: And, nope.

250
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:11,338
Rym: I respect that, I mean, like, Breath of the Wild 2, Tears of the Kingdom, all Nintendo had to say was, "Breath of the Wild 2 is coming, it's called Tears of the Kingdom, it'll be out on this

251
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:11,539
Rym: date.".

252
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,380
Rym: They could have said nothing more, they would have sold the exact same number of copies.

253
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,819
Scott: Well, hold on now, there's a little- alright, so I would have bought it, for sure, right?

254
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:30,220
Scott: But, I had, like I said during the episode, I had suspicions, I was worried it might have just been sort of, like, not a huge difference between that and Breath of the Wild, right?

255
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:39,100
Scott: But, so there are some people who might have been on the fence, and so they had to show a little bit of proof that, like, no, this is a big leap, it's a new deal.

256
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,400
Rym: I see where you're going.

257
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,440
Scott: Some additional people on board.

258
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:53,700
Rym: My counterargument is that a pro move would be to, you still have a marketing blitz and trailers and everything ready to go, but, you release those when you release the thing.

259
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:58,120
Scott: No, I think the pro move would just be, "Don't do the ads," right?

260
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,099
Scott: Other than to say, "A new Zelda is coming on this day," right?

261
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:10,778
Scott: And then, if there are hesitant people who aren't sure, they're not just gonna buy any Zelda sight unseen, the first wave would play it and be like, "Oh,

262
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:11,080
Scott: shit!".

263
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:18,440
Scott: And then that would be the free marketing, and then the second wave, and then in the end, you sell the same number of copies, just maybe a little slower.

264
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:30,619
Rym: But a Miyazaki movie, I think, is a little bit different, because a Miyazaki movie is a particular situation where 100% of the universe of people who care about this know it's coming and will see it when they find out about it.

265
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,740
Scott: Yeah, it's like, if you're already, you know, it's like, if no one's ever heard of you, right?

266
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,880
Scott: Well, then, obviously, you need to do some kind of hustling, right?

267
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,180
Scott: Even though we don't believe in ads and like ads, it's like, if you're trying capitalism...

268
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,560
Rym: Now, that hustle could be press releases, interviews...

269
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,180
Scott: But it's like, you gotta capitalism to some extent, right?

270
00:18:50,240 --> 00:19:03,840
Scott: But if you're already Miyazaki, it's like, the marketing that you've already spent on all your previous movies, and all your previous movies already existing and already having been seen, are the advertising for the next one, right?

271
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:14,180
Scott: It's like, that's the reason we don't need an ad for the new Zelda, it's because I've played other Zelda, so you don't need to advertise, you just need to say, "Hey, another one," right?

272
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:23,860
Scott: So, when you've seen 10 Miyazaki movies, 10 Ghibli movies, and it's like, "Hey, another one," that's all you gotta say, you don't need to do the big marketing thing, because it's already set.

273
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:24,715
Rym: Yup.

274
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,400
Scott: But if this is a new studio, a new director releasing the exact same movie, right?

275
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,660
Scott: Then, you wouldn't be able to get away with that.

276
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:34,519
Scott: So, he basically... If you want a capitalism...

277
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,220
Rym: And the best part is, what he said was, this also influenced him to choose a minimalistic approach.

278
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:42,080
Rym: There will be no film spots, no TV spots, no newspaper ads, nothing.

279
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,219
Rym: Just this visual will do, and then there's a link to...

280
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,151
Scott: Yeah, you need a poster.

281
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:47,800
Scott: You need a poster.

282
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,757
Rym: Yeah, so that poster...

283
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,439
Scott: You need a name.

284
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:59,259
Rym: That poster of the bird-looking thing is the sole artifact that exists in public about this movie, other than the book itself, if you want to go look at it.

285
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,940
Scott: Yeah, you need to have a movie poster, otherwise people go to the theater and they're like, "Which

286
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,020
Scott: one?".

287
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:11,439
Rym: But the movie poster for me could have been Miyazaki made another movie, and it just depicted... You could have just put text, yes.

288
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,391
Scott: And then, you're getting free advertising, because movie theaters are going to say, "Now playing, Hayao Miyazaki's..." Right?

289
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,377
Scott: And movie reviewers are going to say, "I saw this movie, five stars, four

290
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:22,899
Scott: stars."

291
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,191
Scott: Right?

292
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,297
Scott: And then, people on the internet are going to be like,

293
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:26,679
Scott: "Hey!".

294
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:28,860
Scott: So, you're going to get free ads that way.

295
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,233
Scott: You don't need to pay for other capitalists.

296
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,940
Scott: You don't need to basically give free money to TV stations to get ads.

297
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,080
Scott: You can just make more profits.

298
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:44,840
Rym: Yep, in fact, basically, it's almost a gabbo, gabbo, gabbo situation, where you're sort of tricking everyone else into advertising your thing for you.

299
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:46,559
Scott: Well, they do that anyway.

300
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,639
Scott: It's just, that's all the advertising you need, because you're already...

301
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:49,868
Rym: Yep.

302
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,320
Rym: So, in some other news, Image Comics is leaving Diamond Distributors.

303
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,280
Scott: Right, so years and years ago, a long time ago, comic books were sold on the newsstand, right?

304
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,379
Scott: Like, next to the newspapers and the magazines, and all the kids bought them.

305
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:09,117
Scott: And then, when comic books, you know, sort of fell by the wayside, right?

306
00:21:09,981 --> 00:21:11,620
Scott: They got rescued, right?

307
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,980
Scott: The only way they were able to survive was through direct distribution.

308
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:25,220
Scott: Basically, we're going to sell them to comic book stores only, with this wholesale plan, and that way, the margins work out for everybody, and we can keep comic books going that way.

309
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:32,060
Scott: And that's why comic book stores came into existence, and you didn't see so many comic books on the newsstand, right?

310
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:43,660
Scott: And then, the manga times hit, and suddenly all the bookstores were selling all the mangas, and we complained on GeekNights for about a decade, and every other comic book podcast has been complaining for several decades.

311
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,460
Scott: Like, hey, you know, this direct market distribution thing is fucking everything up.

312
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,758
Scott: It's not good anymore, right?

313
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,820
Scott: Now it's a problem, especially since it's all through this one distributor, Diamond, right?

314
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:10,019
Scott: They have this monopoly, they got a stranglehold in the comics industry, holding back, you know, changes and improvements to the way comic books on dead trees are sold to the people in the United States and in other parts of the world, and it's holding back the art form, and et cetera, et cetera.

315
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,520
Scott: So, it was only, not, you know, somewhat recently, a year, you know, a year ago, right?

316
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:26,040
Scott: So Marvel, DC, right, Dark Horse, the biggest publishers, finally ended their exclusive agreements with Diamond, right?

317
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,480
Scott: And maybe, they retained some Diamond relationships, but mostly Left Shift, right?

318
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,899
Scott: Marvel is now being distributed by Random House, IDW and Dark Horse are as well.

319
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:45,780
Scott: DC went to this other distributor called Lunar, and now Image is also going to the Lunar one who distributes the DC comics.

320
00:22:47,080 --> 00:23:00,879
Scott: And so, yeah, this open, you know, the fact that this is now basically all the big, like, manufacturers in the United States and other, right, are now not with Diamond exclusively anymore.

321
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:09,720
Scott: The only ones left at Diamond are like Boom, Dynamite, and like, you know, some other pretty small, the smaller end ones, right?

322
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,999
Scott: Like, Medium at best.

323
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:20,620
Scott: And so, yeah, it's like the end of an era, and we're still seeing, like, what impact this is going to have on comicdom, right?

324
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:23,257
Scott: And I'm not really sure, right?

325
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,757
Scott: It's like, I feel like this move to have a big impact had to happen a longer time ago.

326
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:37,174
Rym: Yeah, because, like, comic shops aren't what they used to be, like, the whole ecosystem has changed so much in the past 20 years that...

327
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:44,560
Scott: Yeah, it's like, people are just reading, you know, people who want to read comics are going very digital, even more so these days.

328
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,360
Rym: I mean, I was reading Chainsaw Man digital, I was reading that Keanu Reeves one digital.

329
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:50,465
Scott: Yep, it's like you got.

330
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:53,318
Scott: the Webtoon thing is really where it's at right now.

331
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,900
Scott: You know, people can basically make webcomics and make money on Webtoon somehow, right?

332
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:02,477
Rym: With the big asterisk of "Does anything make money and will it

333
00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:02,778
Rym: last?".

334
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:04,580
Rym: But that's just an asterisk.

335
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,800
Scott: There are people who make good money on Webtoon.

336
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,640
Rym: Yeah, but Webtoon itself can continue to exist and be profitable long term.

337
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,099
Scott: It's been doing great for quite a few years.

338
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:25,540
Scott: But yeah, personally, I think what happened to me is that there was this long period of time when I was a kid, there were a lot of comics I wanted to read, but I didn't have a lot of money.

339
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:30,660
Scott: And then, you know, access to comics decreased, right?

340
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:41,839
Scott: And then it wasn't until, like, around the time I finished college, I had a job, GeekNights was beginning, I had money, I had access to comics again, comics were, like, booming at the time.

341
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:50,072
Scott: And I was able to acquire and read many comics, and I caught up on all these old comics, right, that I hadn't read, you know, ever, because I wasn't in at the time.

342
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,980
Scott: And then, it took me a long time, I was ordering, reliably, comics every month for years.

343
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,012
Scott: You know, a decade or two, since, like, 2006, right?

344
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:06,119
Scott: Like, I put in orders for comics every single month.

345
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:09,096
Scott: And it wasn't until, like, last year or so where it was.

346
00:25:09,156 --> 00:25:13,600
Scott: finally, like, you know, there's nothing on the order form that I want this month.

347
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,724
Scott: Like, just nothing.

348
00:25:15,106 --> 00:25:17,600
Scott: It's not worth ordering anything, you know?

349
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:20,959
Scott: There's none of these comics, even if I buy them, I'm not gonna read them.

350
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,919
Scott: I don't got room, right?

351
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:34,400
Scott: And nowadays, basically, I'm only buying comics that are made-- I still prefer to read a comic on a dead tree, just because the digital is not perfect, right?

352
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,640
Scott: It's still, you know, text, yeah, of course, I'm gonna read digital no problem.

353
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:50,220
Rym: But, like, now I've even-- I've got such a backlog of dead tree comics that I bought a long time ago, or got, like, full compilations of things that are just sitting there that I haven't had time to read anyway.

354
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,260
Rym: I'm kinda gonna dig into my backlog.

355
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:53,122
Scott: Nope.

356
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:57,960
Scott: So, but yeah, so there are some cases, for example, comics I've read recently, right?

357
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,480
Scott: There was the Mike Allred Silver Surfer that I've wanted to read for a long time.

358
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,571
Scott: And I was like, "You know what?

359
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:06,699
Scott: I'm finally gonna go and read

360
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:06,860
Scott: that.".

361
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,564
Scott: And it was terrific.

362
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:10,099
Scott: I'm sure maybe Rym will read it, we could do an episode on it.

363
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:15,980
Scott: But it's available in this Omnibus edition, which is, like, costs a fortune, right?

364
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,284
Scott: So I'm like, "You know what?

365
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:19,957
Scott: I wonder if I can get it cheaper, or illegally,

366
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:20,440
Scott: right?".

367
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:25,080
Scott: And if you buy the Kindle edition, it's, like, a third of the price.

368
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,711
Scott: It's, like, 30 bucks instead of 100-something, right?

369
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:35,320
Scott: And I read it on my giant iPad, and there were some parts where it wasn't ideal, like big spreads and things like that, right?

370
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,320
Scott: But for the most part, reading on the giant iPad was just fine.

371
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:41,479
Scott: And I saved a lot of money.

372
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:49,420
Scott: There's a comic, a manga I wanted to read for a long time called, uh, Oyasumi Punpun, Goodnight Punpun, right?

373
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:50,548
Scott: I just never bought it.

374
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,000
Scott: It's, like, these eight big volumes.

375
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:54,150
Scott: And I was like, "You know what?

376
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:55,599
Scott: Does the library have

377
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:55,679
Scott: it?".

378
00:26:55,941 --> 00:26:58,140
Scott: Sure enough, the library had most of it, right?

379
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,278
Scott: And I'm just like, "Get it at the library, return

380
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:00,339
Scott: it.".

381
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:06,280
Scott: It's, you know, I like it, I'm reading it, I just don't feel the need to own it, or pay money for it, right?

382
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,778
Scott: So, library is great for that.

383
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:12,000
Scott: Um, and so, yeah, I've just been not ordering.

384
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:18,180
Scott: There's still some months where I order some comics, and other months, I just, you know, and when I do order, it's, like, way less.

385
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,000
Scott: I'm just not seeing things on the order form, right?

386
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,998
Scott: That, like, I feel like I need to, you know, go get, and I'm not going to be able to read them any other way.

387
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:32,260
Rym: That was an era of, like, the fact that you had an order form and a cadence to it.

388
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:46,516
Rym: that was not tied to your life, it was tied to the publication cycle, and we're back in the mode that all other media is of, "Huh, I should consume that piece of media, immediately purchase or acquire it via whatever means at the time, as opposed to a

389
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:46,979
Rym: schedule.".

390
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,420
Scott: Because of Diamond, right, the ordering months in advance was the way to get these things for a significant discount.

391
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:54,058
Rym: That is true.

392
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:56,880
Scott: And I can still do that, even without Diamond, right?

393
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:03,220
Scott: It's still, you know, your retailer is still, you know, has some kind of similar arrangements with whoever the distributors are, right?

394
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,040
Scott: You're not buying from a distributor directly.

395
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:18,860
Scott: But, you know, it's still, it's like, well, there's other ways, you know, it's like the discount for by pre-ordering the giant omnibus early is not as good as the discount of just buying the digital one.

396
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,138
Scott: So, or the discount of going to the library and getting it for zero dollars, or, right?

397
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,199
Rym: Also, just not, like if I'm buying something, not having to take up the space because all my bookshelves are full.

398
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,280
Rym: Any book I buy, book has to go away somewhere.

399
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,680
Scott: Yeah, I'm going to go through again, probably.

400
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Scott: And, you know, I got a pile of books.

401
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,140
Rym: Oh, Emily, we carried over, like, hundreds of dollars worth of books to book off.

402
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,860
Rym: Like, we got a pile of money from that.

403
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,544
Scott: I got a pile.

404
00:28:42,605 --> 00:28:45,577
Scott: that's the pile where I need to read it once, and then I can get rid of it.

405
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,293
Scott: And I've got, and then I'm going to make, there's another pile where it's like, "Yeah, I'm never going to read this again.

406
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:50,555
Scott: It can

407
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:50,757
Scott: go.".

408
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,211
Rym: Yeah.

409
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:54,180
Rym: The only things I'm, I really-- I don't feel that strongly about it.

410
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:00,619
Rym: I only keep special, important books, historic books, things like Sanctuary that I'll never get a physical copy of again in my life.

411
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,203
Scott: Yeah.

412
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:08,184
Scott: There has to be some, for me to keep the book, right, at least once I put through the effort to go through the shelf, right, it has to have.

413
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:17,440
Scott: either I'm going to read it again, it has some significance, it's very hard to obtain it in another format, something of that.

414
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,700
Scott: There has to be some, you know, reason.

415
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:30,820
Scott: But, you know, I guess there is value, though, in just having, you know, some books around, even if you've never read them, or even if you never planned to read them, right?

416
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:37,850
Rym: But anyway, things of the day!

417
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:51,246
Rym: I bumped into this just kind of randomly, and it is, it's in the same genre as, like, the Juggernaut video, or Tjundecats, you know, that type of do-a-funny voice dub over-- Lift 10 Pokemon.

418
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:55,450
Rym: Yep, over at, like, an animated show, especially an old one.

419
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:04,109
Rym: This one's with the old My Little Pony, particularly the My Little Pony and Friends, I think there was a movie or 10 episodes, it's like, I don't know, I never watched it.

420
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,409
Scott: I don't know, I don't know anything about old My Little Pony, other than that, it was a thing.

421
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:12,490
Rym: Of that genre of entertainment, this is one of the better ones I've seen for a few reasons.

422
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:12,670
Rym: I agree.

423
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:22,670
Rym: It's only a minute and 22 seconds long, so it doesn't beat around the bush, like, Tjundecats is really funny, but you could edit that down to be, like, a third of its length, and it would be just as funny.

424
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,810
Rym: Juggernaut, you really only need two scenes in Juggernaut.

425
00:30:27,432 --> 00:30:33,250
Rym: Also, Juggernaut has a lot of unfortunate dialogue that is best forgotten, like, I wouldn't revisit it in a modern era.

426
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:45,310
Rym: But the end of Honeysuckle is concise, the voice acting's good and funny, and that is the plot of that season, as far as I can tell, like, it is that stupid.

427
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:47,170
Rym: So, I laughed out loud.

428
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,049
Rym: This was actually legitimately funny, and I appreciate this, and I think everyone should watch it.

429
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,930
Rym: It's worth a minute and 22 seconds of your time.

430
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,150
Scott: Alright, well, my thing of the day is worth 15 minutes of your time.

431
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,330
Scott: It's on the New York Times Cooking YouTube channel, right?

432
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:07,382
Scott: And basically, they do this profile of a man whose only job is to be a bagel roller.

433
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,990
Scott: He rolls the bagels by hand, right?

434
00:31:13,352 --> 00:31:16,370
Scott: And not a machine-rolled bagel, a hand-rolled bagel, right?

435
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,910
Scott: This man rolls thousands of bagels, right?

436
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,870
Scott: Like, daily.

437
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:31,170
Scott: It only works, like, three to four days a week, and for several different bagel shops, he goes in and he rolls bagels, right?

438
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,510
Scott: Like, that's such a tiny skill, right?

439
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:39,170
Scott: Such a narrow expertise of, like, prepare dough, roll bagels, right?

440
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:40,948
Scott: And then that's all he does.

441
00:31:42,612 --> 00:31:47,870
Scott: And it's pretty amazing to see, like, you know, this person's life story, how they ended up there, right?

442
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:55,280
Scott: How they roll the bagels, you know, the work's really hard, but also, you know, a satisfying craft, right?

443
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,170
Scott: All in of itself, right?

444
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:03,967
Scott: And to, even though you're doing, I guess, what some people might consider, like, low menial labor, right, or whatever, right?

445
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:10,510
Scott: It's like, that person is, like, putting food in the mouths of thousands of, right?

446
00:32:10,952 --> 00:32:21,470
Rym: Well, also just watching a person, a human being, exhibiting, even if it's a narrow skill, such mastery and expertise of that skill.

447
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:28,950
Scott: And this person rolls a bagel in, like, two seconds, and that one bagel, like, you know, the machine mixes the dough, right?

448
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:38,789
Scott: It's like, he rolls a bagel in two seconds, and that two seconds of his hand going back and forth is, like, bringing someone, like, a whole breakfast of joy, right?

449
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,733
Scott: It's just like, bam!

450
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:48,530
Scott: It's like, if I could produce joy at that rate, like, if you look at the joy per work, right, it's like, imagine how much work someone has to do to make a movie.

451
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:53,310
Scott: And the movie brings great joy to many audiences for 90 minutes, right?

452
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:54,727
Scott: And millions of people see it.

453
00:32:55,211 --> 00:33:03,850
Scott: But the work that went in to produce, right, the ratio there, right, is maybe not that big a ratio, right?

454
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,690
Scott: Because it's, like, the amount of work to make the movie is immense.

455
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:18,229
Scott: Whereas, okay, the amount of joy of eating a bagel for 10 minutes might not equal the 90 minute best movie you've ever seen, but a person, all they had to do was move their hand back and forth really fast, right?

456
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:24,130
Rym: Well, you know, we did that panel way back on, like, Take Your Turn and, like, time in games, but we had that point around.

457
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:34,069
Rym: a game that's pretty fun that takes a minute to play is by some measures objectively better than a game that's more fun but takes 30 minutes to play.

458
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:43,710
Scott: Right, so, like, the joy and, you know, the factory that is this person and the joy they produce via bagels is incredible.

459
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:46,250
Scott: And the top, if you read the top comment...

460
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:48,180
Rym: I was about to mention that.

461
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:50,769
Rym: I just clicked Read More and read that whole comment just now.

462
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:56,790
Scott: Right, so a lot of people are coming out like, "Oh, this guy, you know, his labor is being treated poorly.

463
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,924
Scott: This guy's slaving away in the basement making

464
00:33:58,945 --> 00:33:59,348
Scott: bagels.".

465
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:03,809
Scott: The top comment is from the guy who owns the bagel shop, who would be, I guess, the man.

466
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:08,949
Scott: And he's like, "Nope, I realize that basically I depend entirely on this dude.

467
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,105
Scott: I pay him a lot of money and I'm good to his

468
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:14,607
Scott: family.".

469
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:15,989
Scott: Et cetera, et cetera.

470
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,810
Scott: But to be fair, he should just give the guy the bagel shop.

471
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,270
Scott: because what are you doing, owner guy?

472
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:21,540
Scott: What do you do?

473
00:34:22,024 --> 00:34:22,590
Scott: Some paperwork?

474
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,739
Rym: That's right into some communism.

475
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:27,389
Rym: What does capital provide?

476
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:28,871
Scott: Yeah.

477
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:33,110
Scott: Anyway, but yeah, don't worry, the bagel guy is doing alright.

478
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:35,243
Scott: They know his worth.

479
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:36,250
Scott: He knows his own worth.

480
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:41,370
Scott: He could go, if you can hand roll, so few people have the skill at this level.

481
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:57,669
Scott: If you out there listening think that you can roll thousands of bagels in a day, several days a week, you could walk into New York City and name your salary at any number of bagel places because there are not that many people that can do that.

482
00:34:58,232 --> 00:35:08,030
Scott: And when you roll a bagel in two seconds, they pay you six figures, but every time you roll a bagel, they're making several dollars.

483
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,950
Scott: But your two seconds, it's like how much do you want to be paid for two seconds to go ba-bam with your hand, right?

484
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:15,975
Scott: A dollar?

485
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:17,630
Scott: Fine, I'll pay you a dollar.

486
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,850
Scott: A thousand dollars, I'll pay you a dollar a bagel because I'm selling them for you.

487
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,870
Scott: It's like no problem.

488
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:29,487
Rym: In the meta moment, the GeekNights Book Club book is no longer the satanic versus, but it is now.

489
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,090
Rym: The recommendation from one Bigelas Dickolas Wolfwood.

490
00:35:34,152 --> 00:35:36,630
Rym: I shall never get over that account and that situation.

491
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,649
Rym: This is how you lose the time war.

492
00:35:40,593 --> 00:35:41,766
Rym: We don't have any cons coming up.

493
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,863
Rym: Expect to see us at PAX West.

494
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:45,629
Rym: I booked hotels.

495
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,257
Scott: We don't have cons coming up.

496
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:49,209
Scott: See us at PAX West, the con that's coming up.

497
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,030
Rym: Yeah, maybe I'm thinking about going to Kinetic Con.

498
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:54,344
Rym: I might actually go and do some panels.

499
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:55,330
Rym: I'm going to talk to them and see.

500
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,689
Rym: That's an easy day trip.

501
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,830
Scott: I could be convinced if it was very convenient.

502
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,078
Rym: Yeah, so we'll see.

503
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:02,390
Rym: We'll see about Kinetic Con.

504
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,106
Scott: If there's any kind of hassle, then I'd be like,

505
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:04,449
Scott: "Eh.".

506
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:08,110
Scott: But if it's like, "Ah, very convenient to go to Kinetic Con.

507
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,827
Scott: It's as convenient as it can be given the

508
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:10,130
Scott: circumstances."

509
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,224
Scott: Then maybe I could do it.

510
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:21,150
Rym: It would be weird to be at a Kinetic Con and not be literally responsible for a huge percentage of the entire convention's content and just be able to walk around and look around.

511
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:26,330
Rym: That would be a weird situation just because I've never really experienced that.

512
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:31,209
Rym: Also, PAX Unplugged is going to come up toward the end of this year.

513
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,606
Rym: And MagFest looks like it's happening.

514
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:35,370
Rym: Dates were announced.

515
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:38,384
Rym: So if you're not going to book a hotel in...

516
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,850
Scott: The MagFest dates have been slightly adjusted.

517
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:44,050
Scott: It's like a week or two later than usual.

518
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:49,690
Rym: I got a hotel room because I do plan to go to this MagFest and do panels and get back to our old bullshit.

519
00:36:49,892 --> 00:36:51,990
Rym: So stay tuned for those kinds of updates.

520
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,310
Scott: Well, we'll see what happens.

521
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:58,950
Scott: I may or may not go, but we'll see what the circumstances are with how MagFest is doing things.

522
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,810
Scott: We don't know if the mages are still there or what.

523
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,941
Rym: Yeah, they were last year.

524
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:02,590
Rym: I was talking to them.

525
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:07,530
Rym: I sent my regrets that we weren't going to come because of the world situation.

526
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,529
Rym: But I think I want to go to this MagFest and get that ball rolling again.

527
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:14,802
Rym: Let's dive right into Spider-Man.

528
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:23,750
Rym: Now, just because Spider-Man's Spider-Man, but we'll avoid spoilers for this movie until toward the end of the show.

529
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,750
Rym: We'll tell you where the spoiler line is.

530
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:33,590
Scott: I don't believe in spoilers, but I do want to say, actually, the plot here, the spoiler-able plot, is like, it's solid.

531
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:36,563
Scott: It is solid Hollywood comic plot.

532
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:45,830
Rym: The moment when you start to see where it's going, it's a bigger and more poignant and complex plot than I expected.

533
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,350
Rym: And it also works on sort of an allegorical level about comics.

534
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:50,709
Scott: Yeah, we're going to talk about that.

535
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:59,630
Scott: But the point is that the plot is, of all the reasons to see the Spider-Man movies, the two animated ones, the Spider-Verse ones, right?

536
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,409
Scott: The plot is the last reason.

537
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:10,390
Rym: Now, this is the best, I'm going to say straight up, this is, this movie, the best cinematic animation I have ever seen.

538
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:13,888
Scott: I mean, it's tough to say.

539
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:16,169
Rym: I say that only because I struggle.

540
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,110
Scott: Only because the Akira people did not have the luxury.

541
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:38,330
Rym: Oh, oh, oh, yeah, so I am, if I ignore efforts, technology, if you ignore how a movie came to be and just look at what hit my eyes, I struggle earnestly to name anything I have seen that stunned me visually to this degree.

542
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:42,826
Scott: I think, you know, I don't know if this is too big to say, it might be going too far, right?

543
00:38:43,472 --> 00:39:05,989
Scott: But it's not an extreme hyperbole to say that this is a, some sort of revolution in the medium of animation, akin to like when people learned how to paint in perspective or when video games were suddenly not, you know, like 3D, like Mario 64, it's like, or I guess, Mario 64 wasn't actually the first 3D game, but I guess like Quake, right?

544
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:17,609
Rym: It might be more analogous to when first-person shooters went from everything is brown and gray to everything is ultra-realistic to things can have colors and games can be weird.

545
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,290
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, it's that sort of like big leap, right?

546
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:27,609
Scott: The same way that like there was a big leap, you know, in open-world games with Breath of the Wild, right?

547
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:27,951
Scott: -Yeah.

548
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:35,086
Scott: -This is a big leap over, you know, in a way you could say like, you know, it's similar to Breath of the Wild, right?

549
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,297
Scott: -Yeah.

550
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:37,690
Scott: -There's two of them, right?

551
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,107
Scott: There was Breath of the Wild and then...

552
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,590
Rym: And the first one was the best Zelda game to ever be made.

553
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,050
Rym: I'm just going to say it because I think it was.

554
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:51,410
Scott: Right, the first one comes out and is like, you know, sort of shows the potential of the revolution and, you know, sets the stage.

555
00:39:51,832 --> 00:39:54,770
Scott: And then the second one trampolines off the first one, right?

556
00:39:55,191 --> 00:40:07,529
Scott: Spider-Man, the first one comes out, sets the stage, shows what can be possible, and the second one jumps off the trampoline with the first one and is like, that was the set, that was the appetizer, and now I'm the entree.

557
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:18,010
Rym: Yeah, Spider-Man 2 is materially better animated than Spider-Man 1, and I say that already agreeing that Spider-Man 1 is already one of the better animated things ever made.

558
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:23,949
Scott: So this movie starts out, right, in the Guggenheim Museum, right?

559
00:40:25,471 --> 00:40:31,310
Scott: And in the Guggenheim Museum, right, on display are the works of many artists, right?

560
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,990
Scott: I like when the Jeff Koons dog breaks and all the dogs come out.

561
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,020
Rym: And then that one guy was like,

562
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,262
Rym: "Whoa!".

563
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:42,210
Scott: And they're fighting a vulture who's from, like, the Da Vinci universe, who's made out of Da Vinci paper.

564
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,450
Scott: It looks like, you know, what's the thing called?

565
00:40:44,872 --> 00:40:47,950
Scott: You know, what's the name of the Da Vinci thing with the dude with his arms stretched out?

566
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,728
Scott: I don't know what the name of it is.

567
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,677
Rym: The guy, the David guy.

568
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:54,350
Scott: No, David's Michelangelo statue.

569
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,189
Rym: Yeah, but what's the name of that guy?

570
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:56,870
Rym: Da Vinci man.

571
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,845
Scott: I don't know what the name of the Da Vinci thing is with the guy.

572
00:40:59,472 --> 00:40:59,969
Rym: Vitruvian Man.

573
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,283
Scott: Okay, yeah, so it looks like it's the Vitruvian Vulture, basically, right?

574
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,009
Scott: Who's in the Guggenheims.

575
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:20,410
Scott: You have a dude based on one artistic style, right, from the Da Vinci universe, causing a ruckus in a museum, right, messing up all the art of all these different artists, right, and complaining about these other artists.

576
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:25,549
Rym: And you've got a full-on Spider-Man dialogue going the whole time.

577
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:29,696
Scott: But all of this different art is being drawn by one set of artists.

578
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:31,323
Scott: who are the artists?

579
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,890
Scott: animating it, right?

580
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:34,850
Scott: Doing all these different styles, right?

581
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:48,770
Scott: And you go from that to, instead, a multiverse of Spider-Men, where each universe is some sort of different art style, right, all coming together.

582
00:41:48,930 --> 00:42:05,967
Rym: So Spider-Man 1 had a revolution with that animation style and the chromatic aberration, like the way they did it, it was itself revolutionary, but then they also had-- No, the chromatic aberration effect that they used heavily in that movie instead of some 3D effects.

583
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:07,869
Scott: Not really.

584
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,609
Scott: I don't know if that's the correct thing to call it.

585
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:12,170
Rym: I think that's what I would call that.

586
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,429
Rym: That's what I've seen other people call it.

587
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:19,910
Rym: There are other effects that are also at play, like the 2D effects that happen around the 3D characters.

588
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,746
Rym: There's a lot going on.

589
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:32,450
Rym: But then you had a handful of Spider-Men from other universes that had different artistic styles, and in the first Spider-Man movie, those characters were animated in different styles.

590
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:38,670
Rym: Spider-Verse 2, like, took that to the absolute absurd extreme.

591
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:49,430
Rym: You've got thousands of different Spider-Men all in their own styles, and you go across a bunch of different Spider-verses where the background and the setting itself is also in a different style.

592
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:55,890
Rym: Like Spider-Gwen's Spider-Verse look is a completely different style from Morales's Spider-Verse.

593
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,930
Scott: Yep.

594
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:03,530
Scott: So you have that as like your stage setting, right?

595
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:13,526
Scott: And then you basically get into this commentary, right, where it's like, look, people have been making -- telling the story of Spider-Man since the '60s, right?

596
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,349
Scott: Spider-Man isn't actually that old.

597
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:15,770
Scott: Yep.

598
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,349
Scott: Spider-Man's only like 20 years older than we are, right?

599
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,330
Scott: He's not that old.

600
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:28,430
Scott: But if you look at, say, other intellectual properties, right, like a Star Wars or Lord of the Rings or a Star Trek, right?

601
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:32,409
Scott: I guess Star Trek is kind of actually up there in terms of number of Star Trek stories told.

602
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:35,630
Rym: It is now only recently because of a Star Trek explosion.

603
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:36,670
Scott: Right, right.

604
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:47,449
Scott: But it's like because Spider-Man was a comic and there were Spider-Men TV shows, movies, it's like in that time, the number of people involved, right, because it wasn't always just like one person doing it.

605
00:43:47,630 --> 00:44:06,370
Scott: It's like as an artistic collective, right, of all of society around the world, right, mostly in North America but in the English-speaking world, but also in other parts of the world, right, we humans of today have a lot of fucking practice drawing Spider-Man.

606
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:07,190
Scott: Right?

607
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,910
Scott: It's like we are really fucking good at Spider-Man.

608
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,249
Scott: We practiced that shit for so long.

609
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:16,270
Rym: Spider-Man is one of the most recognizable characters in the history of the observed universe.

610
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,990
Scott: He's not up there with the Mario and Mickey Mouse, but he's way up there, way up there.

611
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:25,290
Rym: If you go wherever you live, go out in the street and ask a random person if they know who Spider-Man is.

612
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,989
Rym: They will almost definitely know.

613
00:44:27,811 --> 00:44:30,229
Scott: Depends, depends, but it's likely, right?

614
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:55,010
Scott: And so with all that practice at making Spider-Man, right, it's like normally you look at like other intellectual properties that have lots of adaptations and retellings and remixes and sequels and prequels, right, and what ends up happening is they, yeah, they come out with a different style, a different take, a different, you know, look at Batman movies, right?

615
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,849
Scott: Each one is like a different take, a different style, another one, right?

616
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,350
Scott: But there's still just another one, right?

617
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:05,630
Scott: It's like they might do a better job of it, right?

618
00:45:05,991 --> 00:45:09,710
Scott: But they're doing a better job of doing the same thing.

619
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:09,927
Scott: Yep.

620
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,850
Rym: Like I did not need to see another Batman origin story.

621
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:14,689
Rym: I don't give a shit.

622
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,410
Scott: It's not even just the story being the same, right?

623
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:27,250
Scott: It's just even if you do the origin story again, right, or whether you don't, it's still just another Batman movie, right?

624
00:45:27,752 --> 00:45:31,150
Scott: Even if you do a great job of it, it's still another Batman movie.

625
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:40,030
Scott: And what they've done here in Spider-Verse, right, is they say, look, we're not just going to make another Spider-Man, right?

626
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:42,690
Scott: And they get into a meta commentary.

627
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:46,890
Rym: Oh, yeah, this movie is about Spider-Man, the concept.

628
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:48,130
Scott: Right.

629
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:55,670
Scott: It's like they get into a meta commentary about like, look, you know, in every Spider-Man universe, there are certain things that happen, right?

630
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,710
Scott: It's not spoilers, right?

631
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:02,210
Scott: There's an Uncle Ben that dies, or there's a-- With great power comes great responsibility.

632
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:06,009
Rym: Spider-Man tries to save everybody, and maybe he can't.

633
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:09,310
Scott: There's a Gwen Stacy type of character.

634
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,810
Scott: There's a married-- right?

635
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:20,789
Scott: There's certain-- even whenever anyone does a Spider-Man, you can go read all the different renditions of Spider-Man, and they have these common threads between them.

636
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:22,720
Scott: Right?

637
00:46:23,753 --> 00:46:25,309
Rym: And those-- You realize what you did there, right?

638
00:46:25,871 --> 00:46:26,650
Scott: Yeah, of course.

639
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:36,730
Scott: And those common threads, right, between all the different Spider-Man stories mean that all of them are still just another Spider-Man story.

640
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:39,110
Rym: But they're also connected in this fundamental way.

641
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:39,938
Scott: You're playing-- right.

642
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,470
Scott: It's another person playing the same song in their own way.

643
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:56,389
Scott: And in here, right, what they've done in Spider-Verse is they say, look, right, we're going to go meta and recognize that, first of all, right, which is with the meta trend these days.

644
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,990
Rym: I mean, I think the ultimate villain is canon as a concept.

645
00:46:59,932 --> 00:47:09,287
Scott: And then, not only that, right, but we are going to simultaneously produce a work, right, that is still a Spider-Man story, right?

646
00:47:10,331 --> 00:47:14,090
Scott: You can't say it's not, but is also not, right?

647
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:17,310
Scott: It is not just another Spider-Man story.

648
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:22,250
Rym: Partly because it is also every Spider-Man story, but it's also the er Spider-Man story.

649
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,250
Rym: But it's also this artistic thing.

650
00:47:25,953 --> 00:47:29,750
Scott: We have practiced at doing Spider-Man so much, right?

651
00:47:30,151 --> 00:47:36,310
Scott: We have now found a way to take it to another level and to another place, right?

652
00:47:36,691 --> 00:47:39,810
Scott: And this is what I think the other intellectual properties are lacking.

653
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:46,909
Rym: Star Wars, I think, is the chief-- Just make another one being the wrong way to go.

654
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:52,710
Scott: Star Wars, they haven't practiced making as many Star Wars' as they have Spider-Man's, right?

655
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:59,150
Scott: Even though there's been plenty of books and comics and video games and things like that, it's like there's a lot more practice.

656
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:07,030
Scott: Spider-Man's a bit older too, but there's been a lot more Spider-Man practice going on by artistic creators in the world.

657
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:17,080
Scott: And so they have found a way to take Spider-Man and evolve to a new form and not just make another one, right?

658
00:48:17,931 --> 00:48:22,410
Scott: And so I think that's really special and all the other intellectual properties gotta take note, right?

659
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:34,250
Scott: It's like, what if we saw the Spider-Verse of Star Wars or the Spider-Verse of Lord of the Rings or, I don't know, other intellectual properties out there that are super popular.

660
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,269
Rym: I mean, there aren't that many of them.

661
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:36,206
Scott: Ninja Turtles, right?

662
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,050
Rym: Yeah, Indiana Jones, even.

663
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:42,630
Scott: There aren't that many of them, but-- Right, it's like, you know, no one's taking Indiana Jones to a new level.

664
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,727
Rym: Indiana Jones, they're literally just making more Indiana Joneses.

665
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:52,430
Scott: Right, it's like you're doing, you know, renditions and remixes and whatnot are one thing.

666
00:48:52,830 --> 00:49:01,769
Rym: But I think that is what makes this movie special to the point that we're breaking one of our cardinal rules of praising something to too high of a degree too soon after we saw it.

667
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:06,207
Rym: Usually we're like, "Oh, this anime might be S-tier, but we gotta wait a couple decades to make

668
00:49:06,267 --> 00:49:06,449
Rym: sure.".

669
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:07,769
Scott: No, I can tell you right now.

670
00:49:07,951 --> 00:49:20,969
Rym: And I think it's the confluence of the revolutionary artistic process and style coupled with the, like, new way of telling a Spider-Man story that you described are both in the same trilogy at the same time.

671
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:31,541
Rym: And I think that opening scene in the Guggenheim and, like, that moment is a flex on the level of when Cowboy Bebop had the balls to say, "Yeah, we made a new genre right now.

672
00:49:31,823 --> 00:49:32,024
Rym: Fuck

673
00:49:32,064 --> 00:49:32,145
Rym: you.".

674
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,308
Scott: Pretty much.

675
00:49:35,712 --> 00:49:38,030
Rym: Like, I have no notes about this movie.

676
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:38,834
Rym: And it's long.

677
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:42,608
Rym: Like, it is over two hours long, which I did not know going into it.

678
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:45,149
Scott: And it just walked over.

679
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:46,099
Scott: I knew it was gonna be that long.

680
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,010
Scott: I didn't think it would be that long.

681
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,230
Scott: I thought it was-- I could sort of tell it was gonna be to be continued.

682
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:51,850
Scott: Spoiler, whatever, right?

683
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:57,148
Scott: It's like, you know, because I'm like, "There's no way they can resolve all this given it's already been an

684
00:49:57,188 --> 00:49:57,269
Scott: hour.".

685
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:19,870
Rym: Well, considering that it is 140 minutes of raising the stakes and raising questions, the thing this movie does, unlike Spider-Man 1, which had a lot more downtime and slow beats, which were sort of setting up the characters, this one almost does the same thing at Punch Drunk Love or the second half of Escaflowne do, where it just accelerates and accelerates and accelerates.

686
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:25,410
Rym: And every moment, it's just throwing more at you and adding more complication and expanding what it's about.

687
00:50:25,752 --> 00:50:28,630
Rym: And then at this breakneck speed, it hits a brick wall to be continued credits.

688
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:30,137
Scott: Yep.

689
00:50:31,652 --> 00:50:34,510
Scott: So, yeah, but, yeah, I thought the to be continued was gonna come.

690
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,930
Scott: I was getting that feeling that it was gonna come.

691
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,349
Rym: I thought it was gonna come about a half hour before it did.

692
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,750
Scott: It came way later than I thought it was gonna come.

693
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:50,330
Scott: So, like, I was right that-- I guessed correctly that there's no way it was gonna finish in the one movie once it had been on long enough, but I guessed wrong.

694
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:52,344
Scott: I was like, "Whoa, two hours,

695
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:52,667
Scott: right?".

696
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,588
Scott: It's like, "What other animations are that

697
00:50:55,608 --> 00:50:55,689
Scott: long?".

698
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:56,647
Scott: Well, we looked it up.

699
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:57,925
Scott: This is the longest?

700
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,790
Scott: It's longer than Fantasia.

701
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:07,990
Rym: This is the longest animated feature ever made by an American studio, and it's one of the longest animated films of all time.

702
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:12,401
Rym: It is beaten by a Hungarian animated film that took, like, 30 years to make.

703
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:13,550
Rym: that we just learned about.

704
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:14,770
Scott: Yep.

705
00:51:15,911 --> 00:51:22,369
Scott: And there's an anime movie in this corner of the world that I guess maybe we should watch.

706
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:31,780
Scott: The original version of that movie was only 129 minutes, but there was in 2019 an extended edition released that's 168 minutes, and so that beats Spider-Verse.

707
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:34,869
Scott: So, Spider-Verse is in third place.

708
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:43,290
Rym: Now, I suspect-- Now, I haven't seen that other movie, but if I had to guess, that movie per minute is not as good or entertaining as Spider-Man.

709
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,882
Scott: No, there is no-- Right?

710
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:49,270
Scott: It's like, this Spider-Man movie, for its incredible length, right?

711
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:57,804
Rym: You are-- It's like, normally-- Like, this was a better value than when we saw the Powerpuff Girls movie for 25 cents in the theater.

712
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:59,359
Scott: I thought it was 50 cents.

713
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,905
Rym: 50 cents?

714
00:52:00,027 --> 00:52:00,310
Rym: I forget.

715
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,717
Rym: Like, it wasn't-- I think we each spent 25 cents, so we said 50 cents.

716
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:04,810
Scott: I thought it was 50 cents each.

717
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:05,299
Scott: I don't remember.

718
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:05,830
Scott: It doesn't matter.

719
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,088
Rym: That was, like, 20 years ago.

720
00:52:08,572 --> 00:52:20,150
Scott: The point is, is, like, it's, like, I think I forget what I was talking about when I said this, but I was like, "Oh, it's, like, a delicious meal, but there's so much of it, and then you get full, and you don't want anymore," right?

721
00:52:20,231 --> 00:52:20,983
Scott: It's just, like, 10 steaks, right?

722
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,390
Rym: If this had been four hours long and just kept going, I wouldn't have even been.

723
00:52:25,294 --> 00:52:31,130
Scott: This is, like, a 50-course meal, and somehow every course is delicious, and you have room for more.

724
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:33,350
Rym: You're, like, reaching for the dessert menu again.

725
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:33,794
Scott: Never full.

726
00:52:33,978 --> 00:52:34,589
Scott: Never full.

727
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:45,309
Scott: It's, like, every-- I just bring a different meal, and you eat that different meal, and it's the most delicious one, and somehow I'm still hungry, and they bring another one, and I want another one after that somehow.

728
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:52,929
Rym: Finally, you're like Homer in the seafood restaurant, and you try to get more food, and then suddenly the waiter's like, "Sorry, we're closed," and they just kick you out.

729
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,850
Rym: There isn't even a stinger after the credits.

730
00:52:55,130 --> 00:53:01,930
Rym: It just ends on a "to be continued," and it is 0.25 Escaflones' worth of a cliffhanger.

731
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,430
Scott: Maybe I should just go to the theater and see it again.

732
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,590
Rym: I would watch it again in the theater.

733
00:53:07,158 --> 00:53:08,510
Scott: I can just go over there whenever the hell I want.

734
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,650
Rym: I went and saw the first Spider-Verse in the theater twice.

735
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:11,689
Rym: That's how good it was.

736
00:53:12,431 --> 00:53:13,424
Scott: I can just go over and watch it again.

737
00:53:13,465 --> 00:53:13,850
Scott: No one can stop me.

738
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,350
Rym: Hell, if the first Spider-Verse is in the theater again, I'd watch that there again.

739
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:27,649
Rym: This movie is already on my very short list of movies like Star Wars or The Matrix, where if I see even a few seconds of it and nothing's stopping me, I might just watch it to the end.

740
00:53:28,353 --> 00:53:30,270
Rym: If you put it on a screen, it's like a basilisk.

741
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:30,889
Rym: It'll trap you.

742
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,230
Scott: And there's another one that's coming, right?

743
00:53:33,412 --> 00:53:34,448
Scott: We're gonna get another one.

744
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,299
Rym: If that other one's also 140-plus minutes, like...

745
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:39,769
Scott: Yeah.

746
00:53:40,492 --> 00:53:41,950
Scott: It's gonna come March next year.

747
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:42,546
Scott: It's weird.

748
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:51,790
Rym: It is weird for you and I on GeekNights because we have a reputation for being kind of old, cynical nerd guys to be so hype about this movie.

749
00:53:52,192 --> 00:53:53,290
Rym: And I'm still riding high.

750
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,407
Scott: Normally, I'm like the anti-fan of all the live-action superhero movies.

751
00:54:00,097 --> 00:54:04,449
Rym: I am picky about what I watch, and Scott is like an order of magnitude pickier than me.

752
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:11,290
Rym: And the fact that both of us, this movie is 11 out of 10, things change because of this movie.

753
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:23,230
Rym: This movie, I think, I'm gonna say right now, I think this movie, this trilogy, is going to impact a future generation of creators the way that Star Wars impacted a global generation of creators.

754
00:54:25,573 --> 00:54:31,970
Scott: This is now... Is this... I think there's been so many Spider-Man.

755
00:54:32,331 --> 00:54:34,788
Scott: Is this the best Spider-Man of all Spider-Mans?

756
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:36,890
Rym: Yes, because it is all Spider-Mans.

757
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,748
Rym: It's about all Spider-Mans.

758
00:54:39,932 --> 00:54:48,649
Scott: It's like if you're going to... If you have to pick one Spider-Man thing, a comic or a book or a... I've read a Spider-Man book with text, by the way.

759
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:50,590
Scott: They exist.

760
00:54:51,754 --> 00:54:53,449
Scott: Or a movie or a TV show.

761
00:54:54,413 --> 00:54:56,389
Scott: And you gotta pick one to rule them all.

762
00:54:56,913 --> 00:54:57,549
Scott: This is the one.

763
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:02,050
Scott: This is like... This is the best Spider-Man thing that has been made.

764
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:03,790
Scott: Better than any Stan Lee Spider-Man.

765
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,769
Scott: Not that the other ones aren't good.

766
00:55:07,316 --> 00:55:08,070
Rym: It's a step above.

767
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:16,910
Rym: But the fact that it might be the best one and it's about Spider-Man as a concept is a confluence that is exceptional.

768
00:55:18,818 --> 00:55:23,489
Scott: I mean, just think about something like, you know, Van Gogh doing sunflowers.

769
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:24,371
Scott: Right?

770
00:55:24,736 --> 00:55:26,779
Scott: And it's like, Van Gogh does more sunflowers.

771
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:27,930
Scott: He gets better at sunflowers.

772
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:28,732
Scott: Right?

773
00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:32,761
Scott: How many people after Van Gogh have like, you know, done some sunflowers?

774
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:33,550
Scott: Right?

775
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:39,350
Scott: It's like people have been painting sunflowers for a long time, copying Van Gogh's style, doing it in their own style.

776
00:55:39,876 --> 00:55:40,098
Scott: Right?

777
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:44,727
Scott: But it's like, even after... How long has Van Gogh, like 1800 or something?

778
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,117
Scott: Really long time ago.

779
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,590
Scott: Longer ago than Spider-Man.

780
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:48,287
Scott: Right?

781
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:52,969
Scott: Has anyone revolutionized and taken the sunflower painting to a new level?

782
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:53,812
Scott: Right?

783
00:55:54,523 --> 00:55:54,990
Scott: You know, maybe.

784
00:55:55,692 --> 00:55:57,290
Scott: I'm not paying attention to the painting world.

785
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,470
Rym: I could be missing out.

786
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,770
Rym: What's the best sunflower work of art that was ever made?

787
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,110
Rym: Let us know in the comments.

788
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,749
Scott: I could be missing out on some sunflower out there.

789
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:05,494
Scott: Right?

790
00:56:05,837 --> 00:56:08,510
Scott: You know, I've seen the Van Gogh, not all of them, right?

791
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:10,209
Scott: But, you know.

792
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:24,384
Scott: But here, it's like, it's as if... Imagine if I come out with a sunflower painting and you can look at it next to the Van Gogh and it's like, you know, looking at a Mario 64 next to a Mario 1.

793
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:25,910
Scott: It's like that dramatic difference.

794
00:56:27,014 --> 00:56:27,761
Scott: And that's the difference.

795
00:56:27,782 --> 00:56:34,535
Scott: You put Spider-Verse next to any previous Spider-Man and it's like looking at Mario 1 next to Mario 64.

796
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:35,529
Scott: The difference between them.

797
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:46,909
Scott: And it's like to achieve that in a time when people have already had access to all computer animation techniques and such for a long time already, right?

798
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:48,228
Scott: To achieve it now.

799
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:49,999
Scott: Right?

800
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,290
Scott: It's like, that's something else.

801
00:56:51,793 --> 00:56:51,975
Scott: Right?

802
00:56:52,056 --> 00:56:57,490
Scott: Rather than you would expect it at a point like with Mario 64 where it's like, "Ah, we have a new technology available.

803
00:56:57,611 --> 00:56:59,812
Scott: That's why we were able to go to this new

804
00:56:59,852 --> 00:57:00,236
Scott: level.".

805
00:57:00,478 --> 00:57:03,610
Scott: But there isn't any particular new technology now.

806
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,561
Rym: There are some tools, some techniques, some processing power.

807
00:57:06,783 --> 00:57:07,147
Scott: There are things

808
00:57:07,653 --> 00:57:23,488
Rym: that facilitated this, but other studios have access to those tools and what's different here is that they decided to push those tools to their limits while also it's almost like they sat down as they were putting this together and continuously everyone was always thinking, "How could we push this

809
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:23,730
Rym: further?"

810
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:25,409
Rym: at every step of the way.

811
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:26,292
Scott: Right.

812
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:37,747
Scott: But with Toy Story, you can point at it and be like, you know, "Yes, Toy Story was a big dramatic improvement achievement, et cetera, but there was a thing happening in the world that allowed that to

813
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:37,989
Scott: happen."

814
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:39,034
Scott: Right?

815
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:42,437
Scott: And it's sort of like Spider-Verse doesn't have some excuse.

816
00:57:42,762 --> 00:57:42,944
Scott: Right?

817
00:57:42,984 --> 00:57:43,349
Scott: Like that.

818
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:47,202
Scott: There's less credit to the computer people.

819
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,070
Scott: Not that there's none.

820
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:48,853
Scott: Right?

821
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:53,304
Scott: And more credit on the artists who have been practicing drawing Spider-Man for 60 years.

822
00:57:55,039 --> 00:58:01,103
Rym: So yeah, we've already talked for an hour, so I almost don't even want to get into, like, I guess we could spend a couple minutes.

823
00:58:01,123 --> 00:58:01,930
Rym: Spoilers, I guess.

824
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,610
Scott: There's, I mean, it's the plot is not that important.

825
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,306
Scott: It's a really solid plot.

826
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:08,721
Scott: You care about the characters.

827
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:11,083
Scott: I guess they're acted well.

828
00:58:11,103 --> 00:58:22,619
Rym: Specific scenes are things that, the fact that it's Beagle Guy and how they weave, like, the villain of the week into calling him a villain of the week becomes the meta plot.

829
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,209
Rym: Like, every one of those threads ties so tightly.

830
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:29,709
Scott: Well, it's also about, you know, Spider-Man is all about, you know, these villains of the week.

831
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:32,598
Scott: Lots of weird ones.

832
00:58:32,941 --> 00:58:36,719
Scott: And so to take one and to, I think that's also, that's the thing that's been done before.

833
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,190
Scott: Taking a villain of the week and sort of leveling them up to being for real.

834
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,027
Rym: Yeah, that's a common trope in Spider-Man comics, in fact.

835
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:44,428
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

836
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:59,830
Rym: But the style of the Gwen of, like, when they're in Gwen's universe, like, those painterly, diffuse, vague backgrounds everywhere, and how the colors literally change based on the emotional content of, like, what's happening.

837
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:01,930
Scott: You mean, like, what you do in comic books?

838
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:02,777
Rym: Yeah.

839
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,469
Rym: Punk Spider-Man might be the best Spider-Man of all time.

840
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:10,376
Scott: Yeah, whoever, like, whoever did the Punk Spider-Man is some sort of genius person.

841
00:59:10,436 --> 00:59:13,130
Rym: Yeah, that Spider-Man is fantastic.

842
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:18,076
Scott: The mixture of the live-action stuff.

843
00:59:18,156 --> 00:59:20,880
Rym: Yes, pull it, because it's every Spider-Man.

844
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,729
Rym: Literally.

845
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:25,767
Scott: It wasn't, they didn't do it, they didn't do it in a Roger Rabbit way, right?

846
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:34,195
Scott: They didn't do it in a, uh, you know, it's like, there's been lots of things that have mixed the live-action and the animation previously, right?

847
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:41,185
Scott: But this is doing it in, like, you know, I guess I've never seen anyone do it quite this way before, right?

848
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:41,590
Rym: Yep.

849
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:51,849
Rym: Well, 'cause they're all just Spider-Man, and it was heartfelt, and there's a little aside here that this was the first movie I have seen in a regular multiplex since COVID.

850
00:59:52,334 --> 00:59:54,537
Scott: Like, I've only gone to- No, I've seen quite a few.

851
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:56,658
Rym: I haven't, we've only been going to really boutique theaters.

852
00:59:57,103 --> 01:00:00,010
Rym: We went to an Alamo Drafthouse a little bit before this for another movie.

853
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:21,140
Rym: But, uh, we were in a packed theater, like in a regular old, like regal multiplex, and I missed seeing a movie like this, where occasionally, like, it can be overdone, and it can be a problem, but when the crowd just sort of spontaneously all cheers at something at the same time, I do enjoy that feeling, that camaraderie.

854
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:27,463
Scott: Well, so the Woo game, usually, is like a thing that's, like, bothersome, right?

855
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:32,553
Scott: It's like, "Oh, you're just getting a cheap cameo in there to make people go 'Woo,' right?

856
01:00:32,573 --> 01:00:35,037
Scott: You got some fan service in there, right?

857
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:37,446
Scott: Just to audience pleasers and whatnot,

858
01:00:37,627 --> 01:00:37,789
Scott: right?".

859
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:37,870
Scott: Yep.

860
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:42,392
Scott: And usually, to me, that's cheap, that's not, you know, right?

861
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:45,545
Rym: Every one of these was heartfelt, made sense, fit into the movie.

862
01:00:45,586 --> 01:00:48,676
Scott: The ones, right, the ones that they did, right?

863
01:00:48,736 --> 01:00:52,655
Scott: I think the one that I can point to the most, right, is the Lego one.

864
01:00:52,776 --> 01:00:53,201
Scott: Yeah!

865
01:00:53,221 --> 01:00:55,950
Scott: They bring in Lego, they bring in Lego Spider-Man, right?

866
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:57,503
Scott: A crowd pleaser, right?

867
01:00:57,523 --> 01:01:00,815
Scott: So, it's like, they bust out Lego Spider-Man, and everyone's like, "Woo!

868
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:01,178
Scott: Lego

869
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:01,421
Scott: Spider-Man!".

870
01:01:01,441 --> 01:01:02,894
Scott: You know, it's like, right?

871
01:01:03,096 --> 01:01:04,888
Scott: We love Lego's Woo game, right?

872
01:01:06,353 --> 01:01:11,624
Scott: And so, but, the amount of that scene for this Lego Spider-Man is really short.

873
01:01:11,665 --> 01:01:12,756
Scott: It's got to be less 30 seconds.

874
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:16,494
Scott: 30 seconds, less than a minute, right?

875
01:01:16,918 --> 01:01:20,836
Scott: And here's what's cram-packed into this 30 seconds to a minute of Lego Spider-Man.

876
01:01:20,856 --> 01:01:23,281
Scott: Number one, they got Woo game in there, okay, right?

877
01:01:23,524 --> 01:01:28,839
Scott: Number two, they're bringing in stop-motion animation into a film that is otherwise computer-animated.

878
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:38,514
Scott: I'm sure computers are helping in some way, but it's like a whole different animation style, right, that I'm sure that they actually stop-motion those Legos with a camera, mostly for that scene, right?

879
01:01:40,088 --> 01:01:41,398
Scott: Three, right?

880
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:50,150
Scott: You're bringing in the tired, old role of animation as a toy-selling machine, right?

881
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:55,909
Scott: 'Cause I don't know how well Spider-Man Legos sell, but I bet you they're selling a little better today.

882
01:01:56,752 --> 01:01:59,009
Rym: I think any Spider-Man thing is selling a little better today.

883
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:00,333
Scott: Right?

884
01:02:00,414 --> 01:02:03,584
Scott: It's like, you know, they made Spider-Man Legos look cool.

885
01:02:03,685 --> 01:02:06,130
Scott: That was the best ad for Spider-Man Legos you could ever see.

886
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,629
Scott: 'Cause I've looked at those sets and they don't seem really exciting Lego-wise, right?

887
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:11,018
Scott: But you know what?

888
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,709
Scott: I could get just a Spider-Man Lego minifig only.

889
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,828
Scott: And I would be very happy to get one of those.

890
01:02:17,558 --> 01:02:17,723
Scott: Right?

891
01:02:17,743 --> 01:02:19,070
Scott: They bring that in, right?

892
01:02:19,973 --> 01:02:21,590
Scott: It's relevant to the plot that's happening.

893
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,989
Scott: So the plot of the movie advances a tiny bit.

894
01:02:24,812 --> 01:02:31,058
Scott: And, right, they have a great joke, right, in that scene where it's like, "You're one of our

895
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:31,423
Scott: best."

896
01:02:31,545 --> 01:02:34,738
Scott: And it's like, right, where he tells the Lego Spider-Man, he's like, "You're one of our best

897
01:02:34,758 --> 01:02:35,345
Scott: Spider-Men."

898
01:02:35,628 --> 01:02:35,770
Scott: Right?

899
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,889
Scott: And it's like, funny, 'cause he's a little Lego guy.

900
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:40,028
Scott: How good could he be?

901
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:42,347
Scott: But he's one of the best ones.

902
01:02:45,576 --> 01:02:56,350
Scott: And it even shows like, I love how it shows like, you know, you also get a little bit of, you know, Spider-Man, you know, 'cause the whole J. Jonah Jameson thing in the newspaper is a big part of most Peter Parker Spider-Mans.

903
01:02:56,792 --> 01:03:00,110
Scott: And it's not a part of the Miles Morales ones really at all, right?

904
01:03:00,431 --> 01:03:03,710
Scott: So they can only sneak that in to the movie in other places.

905
01:03:04,472 --> 01:03:14,613
Scott: And I think that's where it featured most prominently in this movie, 'cause you got the Lego Spider-Man, well, the Lego Peter Parker with his Lego camera in Jameson's office, like, "Yo, get me pictures of

906
01:03:14,634 --> 01:03:15,083
Scott: Spider-Man!".

907
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:18,430
Scott: So they wedged that in there too, right?

908
01:03:19,115 --> 01:03:20,999
Scott: All in a minute.

909
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,389
Scott: They managed to do all of that.

910
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:23,412
Rym: Right?

911
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:23,597
Rym: - Yup.

912
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:25,603
Rym: I think a thing that really...

913
01:03:25,623 --> 01:03:29,549
Scott: - With a like a sheet of meta-commentary over the whole thing.

914
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:35,521
Rym: - Then we've got the Bombay Mumbai-ish Spider-Man story, that whole...

915
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:41,419
Scott: - Yeah, I'm pretty sure that Spider-Man was, I didn't read it, but I think that they didn't, like, create that for this movie.

916
01:03:41,439 --> 01:03:42,570
Scott: I'm pretty sure that was in a comic.

917
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:57,950
Rym: - But there was a moment, and it was relevant because we're in a theater with a bunch of people, because there's a moment where Spider-Man in that universe has to choose between saving someone on a bus or someone else in a different location.

918
01:03:58,632 --> 01:04:02,692
Rym: And he tries to save both, which is a common trope in Spider-Man.

919
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:15,526
Rym: Like, you see a scene that has happened in a lot of Spider-Men, and there's a moment where a lot of people in the audience, as soon as they saw the framing of that scene, gasped, and were like, "Oh, I know what's gonna

920
01:04:15,566 --> 01:04:15,829
Rym: happen.".

921
01:04:16,212 --> 01:04:22,510
Rym: And the fact that the movie not only inverts that, but the fact that it is inverted is a plot point.

922
01:04:22,631 --> 01:04:25,504
Rym: that is part of the point of the entire trilogy.

923
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:28,050
Rym: Like, it is directly relevant to the story.

924
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:34,890
Rym: The fact that that went down the way it went down, that was just a sublime, well done, not a misdirection.

925
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:36,127
Rym: It was just a good scene.

926
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:41,196
Scott: Yeah, so Spider-Man India was in a comic that was a limited series in 2004-2005.

927
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,469
Scott: It was four issues.

928
01:04:45,472 --> 01:04:50,348
Scott: And then Spider-Man India has also, again, reappeared, I guess, like in some cartoons and things like that.

929
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,581
Scott: But then, this is like, they brought him back big time.

930
01:04:53,661 --> 01:04:59,269
Scott: A significant part of the movie is, you know, Spider-Man India.

931
01:04:59,633 --> 01:05:02,930
Rym: So yeah, go, just go see this movie.

932
01:05:05,057 --> 01:05:06,370
Rym: The highest possible recommendation.

933
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:18,441
Scott: It's like, you know, I think we did an episode on Spider-Man, a GeekNights episode on Spider-Man, and I talked about, I think I talked about how, like, I always like Spider-Man, right?

934
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:20,708
Scott: It's like, you know, Spider-Man's a New York guy.

935
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:22,366
Rym: Wisecracking.

936
01:05:23,877 --> 01:05:28,763
Scott: Right, but it's like, you don't think of yourself as like a Spider-Man fan.

937
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,430
Scott: I'm not out there buying Spider-Man stuff, right?

938
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,847
Scott: I made fun of that guy at the Comic-Con who only read Silver Age Spider-Man comics.

939
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,238
Scott: You know, I never had like Spider-Man Halloween costume, right?

940
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,450
Scott: But it's like, but when a Spider-Man hits, right?

941
01:05:43,872 --> 01:05:46,884
Scott: It's like, I remember how much I like Spider-Man.

942
01:05:46,924 --> 01:05:49,167
Scott: It's like, you don't realize how much you like it.

943
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:58,728
Scott: I often criticize other people for not understanding what they like or not being introspective or, you know, not knowing why they like what they like, right?

944
01:05:58,809 --> 01:06:04,968
Scott: And things of that nature, but it's like, you know, I didn't, you know, I like Spider-Man more than I think I like Spider-Man.

945
01:06:05,931 --> 01:06:06,079
Scott: Right?

946
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:11,859
Rym: Because you don't think about him day-to-day, but then a Spider-Man company hits and you're like, "Oh, Spider-Man.

947
01:06:12,062 --> 01:06:12,629
Scott: I'll go check that

948
01:06:12,649 --> 01:06:12,710
Scott: out.".

949
01:06:12,771 --> 01:06:15,737
Scott: It's like, I'm just, even before the movie came out, it's like.

950
01:06:15,797 --> 01:06:17,759
Scott: somehow I just got in a Spider-Man mood.

951
01:06:18,164 --> 01:06:31,129
Scott: It's like, you know, but like, the other, you know, intellectual properties have not been as successful at like, you know, the Star Wars didn't get me in a Star Wars movie.

952
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:33,473
Rym: We're not gushing about the Mario movie like this.

953
01:06:34,564 --> 01:06:36,402
Scott: Mario didn't get me in a Mario mood.

954
01:06:36,483 --> 01:06:38,120
Scott: I'm gonna go see that movie though at some point.

955
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:38,605
Scott: Oh yeah.

956
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:40,178
Rym: Still in theaters, like all over the place.

957
01:06:40,643 --> 01:06:47,939
Scott: But it's like, you know, I was able, like the fact that I can even have a Spider-Man mood of like, I'm feeling like Spider-Man.

958
01:06:47,979 --> 01:06:51,130
Scott: I wanna go, I kinda wanna just go get a Spider-Man comic and read it.

959
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:52,829
Scott: I'm feeling, you know, like.

960
01:06:53,755 --> 01:06:55,980
Scott: I can't get that feeling for the, you know, so.

961
01:06:56,060 --> 01:07:01,230
Rym: But it just so happens that the Spider-Man we got now is one of the better movies ever made by humans.

962
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,877
Rym: Like, just go watch this thing.

963
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:06,850
Scott: Yeah, I think you just hang this shit in the Louvre, right?

964
01:07:07,553 --> 01:07:09,593
Rym: Just have it playing on a loop in the Louvre.

965
01:07:10,442 --> 01:07:12,019
Scott: Just put, I mean it wouldn't be wrong.

966
01:07:18,042 --> 01:07:20,292
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

967
01:07:20,332 --> 01:07:25,320
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

968
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:30,753
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

969
01:07:30,996 --> 01:07:33,663
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

970
01:07:33,805 --> 01:07:38,430
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

971
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:41,911
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

972
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:46,270
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

973
01:07:46,472 --> 01:07:49,280
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

974
01:07:49,561 --> 01:08:07,624
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this New York Hellscape edition of the GeekNights Podcast are Gigi Threadler, The Tenderbread Case, Cara Makes Music, Kristin Dodd, Clinton Walton, Dex Finn, Joel Hayes, Penny Reimer, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erikson, Sherman Von Harl, and tons and tons of people who give us like a dollar.

975
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:13,824
Rym: So we're thinking this is a very early conversation, but we were waiting for the long tail of COVID.

976
01:08:14,228 --> 01:08:15,500
Rym: So we are resuming.

977
01:08:15,844 --> 01:08:23,799
Rym: after we get the website live, we're resuming our exploration of running a one day GeekNights sponsored gaming convention of some kind.

978
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,459
Rym: So I figured anyone who listens to the end here, I want to let you know that that's something we're looking at.

979
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:34,571
Rym: It seems like it's finally time to kick that kind of thing off, so tentatively, around the end of fall of 2024 is where I'm looking.

980
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,307
Rym: Got some leads.

981
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:37,803
Rym: Let's leave that with you.

982
01:08:37,884 --> 01:09:00,100
Rym: Tonight, I'll simply leave you with... A human being who lives on the other side of the rainbow.

983
01:09:00,121 --> 01:09:00,950
Rym: Yeah, alright.

984
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,814
Rym: *whistles* Megan.

985
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,062
Rym: Megan.

986
01:09:04,082 --> 01:09:05,870
Rym: We need your help, Megan.

987
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:07,335
Rym: What?

988
01:09:10,036 --> 01:09:11,069
Rym: We need your help, Megan.

989
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:11,734
Rym: Again?

990
01:09:11,956 --> 01:09:13,710
Rym: All the flutter ponies have been captured.

991
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:15,413
Scott: Again?

992
01:09:15,434 --> 01:09:18,562
Rym: Will you come back and help us defeat the people and free our friends?

993
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:20,117
Scott: Can't the other ponies help?

994
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,109
Rym: They have also all been captured.

995
01:09:23,212 --> 01:09:24,706
Rym: You're the only one who can help, Megan.

996
01:09:24,948 --> 01:09:28,493
Rym: We need your human mongous brain and dextrous fingers to rescue them.

997
01:09:28,513 --> 01:09:28,553
Rym: Um...

998
01:09:32,282 --> 01:09:32,537
Scott: Okay.

999
01:09:34,368 --> 01:09:34,671
Rym: *whistles* Hey.

1000
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:35,359
Rym: Nah, crap.

1001
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,653
Rym: Let the ponies go.

1002
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:37,867
Scott: The fuck are you supposed to be?

1003
01:09:37,968 --> 01:09:39,511
Scott: No, I said let the ponies go.

1004
01:09:39,635 --> 01:09:39,718
Scott: No.
