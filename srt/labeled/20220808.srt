00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,750
Rym: It's Monday, August 8th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:10,931
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:14,275
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,747
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,980
Rym: Tonight, we are talking about vacuum cleaners.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,359
Rym: Be sure to submit your show ideas to community.frontrowcrew.com.

7
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,398
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:32,800
Scott: Alright, so you know we like to get the food boxes, you know, to reduce, you know, so we can still cook, but reduce food effort, right?

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,280
Scott: And even though it's expensive, it's cheaper than ordering and whatnot, right?

10
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:42,580
Rym: Yeah, I think we're gonna stick with like purple carrot, like the two boxes a week, and mostly shut down the rest of them.

11
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:54,120
Scott: Anyway, the point is, is that one thing that those boxes do well, we've talked about, is they only give you, right, the exact amount of ingredients, so there's a lot less food waste, right?

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,467
Rym: Yeah, like, "Oh, you need something weird, like a demi-glace.

13
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:58,434
Rym: Here is just like, here is a little container.

14
00:00:58,474 --> 00:00:59,377
Rym: that is exactly what you

15
00:00:59,457 --> 00:00:59,538
Rym: need.".

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,920
Scott: Right, so, but, you know, they include ingredients, right, that aren't usually sometimes in the grocery store.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,660
Scott: For example, they'll include like a spice mix, and it's like, you could try to recreate the spice mix, but that's their spice mix, you'll never be exactly right.

18
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:16,800
Scott: I guess that's fine a lot of times, right?

19
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:18,200
Rym: Yeah, I've never had a spice mix.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,538
Scott: If it says Mexican spice mix, it's like, "Just do a chili powder based spice mix, you'll be

21
00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:22,899
Scott: alright.".

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,300
Rym: Yeah, there's never been a food box that came where the spice mix was so notable that I had to recreate it.

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,540
Scott: Exactly, but sometimes they do include a rare or somewhat difficult to get ingredient, right, period.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,180
Scott: You know, and living in New York City, that's obviously the case less often.

25
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:48,360
Scott: The groceries here have all kinds of fucking shit from all over the world, and very few things are difficult to find.

26
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:54,298
Scott: But, you know, I went and I picked out a food box recipe to go and redo, right?

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,780
Rym: Yeah, I've done that a few times, it usually works out really well.

28
00:01:58,463 --> 00:01:58,878
Scott: Yeah, why not?

29
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:09,999
Scott: And one of the ingredients was indeed what Rym just pronounced incorrectly that I don't blame him for, because I also did not know how to pronounce "dumiglas," right?

30
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,559
Scott: It is French, obviously, right?

31
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:30,059
Scott: And basically, if you don't know what that is, it's sort of like you take stock and you take some wine, maybe, and you reduce that shit, but you don't reduce it to where it's thick, but it's obviously thicker than just watery stock, they call it.

32
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:34,840
Scott: And it's directly translated, it means "half glaze," right?

33
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,660
Scott: It's like you reduce stock halfway to being glazed.

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,599
Rym: Yeah, I mean, it's basically it's in the family of what, like browns, like brown sauces, like there's different kinds of sauces.

35
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:48,440
Rym: It's orthogonally adjacent, it's in the class gravy in my brain.

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
Scott: And you could use different stocks, right?

37
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,120
Scott: Veal, beef, chicken, whatever, right?

38
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,700
Scott: But anyway, mushroom, whatever.

39
00:02:57,641 --> 00:03:00,980
Scott: So I needed some for this recipe, but I need two fucking tablespoons.

40
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:01,559
Scott: That's it.

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,300
Rym: That's all I need.

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,340
Rym: I would say, unless this was an ultra-fancy recipe, I would just use some like thick stock instead.

43
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,279
Rym: I wouldn't even bother.

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,160
Scott: Right, but it's like, you'd have to still get some stock.

45
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,579
Scott: And like, I saw a recipe for it.

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,339
Rym: Oh, put a balloon cube in a cup of hot water, mix it up, reduce it a little bit, you're good to go.

47
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:24,319
Scott: No, they're like, they're like, "Oh, you want to make some?

48
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,731
Scott: Easy peasy, reduce it for 16

49
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:25,832
Scott: hours.".

50
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:29,236
Scott: And I'm like, "16 hours to get one minor

51
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:29,780
Scott: ingredient?".

52
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,240
Scott: It's like, I could probably just cook the dish without that ingredient.

53
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,139
Scott: It'd probably be fine.

54
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,798
Rym: That's basically what I would do.

55
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:37,739
Scott: But you know, I'm like, you know what?

56
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,139
Scott: Might as well go and look and see if I can just buy it in the grocery, because our groceries got all kinds of shit in them.

57
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,920
Scott: Let me see.

58
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,738
Rym: I wonder if Fresh Direct has it.

59
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,219
Rym: I bet not.

60
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,377
Rym: Hopefully we'll see.

61
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,280
Rym: I've been surprised by Fresh Direct before.

62
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,240
Scott: Yeah, we didn't look it there, but it's possible.

63
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,478
Scott: But yeah, I looked all the fuck over for it.

64
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:59,120
Scott: And it was not in like three different groceries.

65
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:00,696
Rym: Fresh Direct does not have it.

66
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,520
Scott: Despite being in New York City, it's not here.

67
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,600
Scott: So I heard some rumors it might be at Wegman or Whole Foods, but Costco is literally a block away.

68
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,580
Scott: But I don't have a membership, but I'm not paying a whole membership to get two tablespoons of liquid.

69
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,019
Scott: But maybe I'll check Wegman or Whole Foods, right?

70
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,939
Rym: Just, you know, maybe not.

71
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,638
Rym: Maybe it's an excuse to go to that Wegman anyway, which I've still never actually been inside of.

72
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:37,760
Scott: All I'm saying is like, you know, what's up with the grocery stores having every ingredient in the known universe, including stuff way weirder than dummy glass and not having it.

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,517
Scott: It's like, come on.

74
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,800
Rym: Of course, the alternative is outside of the city.

75
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,680
Rym: Like, you know, when you used to live upstate, there'll be the mega grocery store that has everything basic in the world.

76
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:49,360
Rym: But usually those don't have any of this kind of stuff either.

77
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:50,180
Scott: They don't have any.

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,820
Scott: Yeah, they have everything basic and nothing not basic.

79
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,200
Scott: Whereas here we have basic and not basic, but just not this other thing, right?

80
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,560
Rym: I wonder if it just doesn't keep well, or it's like not easy to, like there's probably a reason why it's not easy to just buy.

81
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,220
Scott: I mean, there was the time where I needed Lyle's Golden Syrup, which is a very UK ingredient.

82
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:12,060
Rym: I've used that to make cookies before.

83
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,979
Scott: But there was a UK specialty, you know, grocer in the Manhattan that I just went and walked over to from work.

84
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:23,960
Scott: During a time when I was still working in Manhattan, and I just picked some up, no problem.

85
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:26,880
Scott: But I don't know what specialty grocer is.

86
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,500
Scott: Is there, maybe I have to find a French specialty grocer?

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,592
Scott: Will they even have it?

88
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:31,038
Scott: I don't know.

89
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:32,760
Rym: Well, either they'll have it.

90
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,878
Scott: If anyone knows where to get it without making it.

91
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:36,500
Rym: I have a theory.

92
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:39,040
Rym: This is more like a supposition.

93
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,310
Rym: Possibly the specialty store for French cuisine would tell someone like us, "Why would you buy it?

94
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:47,358
Rym: Make it or go

95
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:47,540
Rym: home.".

96
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:50,480
Rym: I can see that happening.

97
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:59,080
Rym: Though, and some other, at least it's weird for something reasonably good to happen in American politics lately.

98
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:07,300
Rym: But that big bill, which actually kind of is almost a tech news, the big infrastructure inflation reduction bill, it actually passed.

99
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,180
Rym: And it has a few things that are actually going to be pretty good for the US technology sector around like, it's obviously not a perfect bill.

100
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,999
Rym: It's missing a lot.

101
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,038
Rym: I can get into that in a second, but it is going to...

102
00:06:19,563 --> 00:06:20,878
Scott: Everything is missing a lot.

103
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,976
Rym: Yeah, but it is going to force...

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,875
Scott: If something happened that wasn't missing a lot, we'd be like,

105
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:26,136
Scott: "Whoa!".

106
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:29,880
Rym: But it does have some stuff around.

107
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:49,419
Rym: Basically, electric cars, to qualify for all these credits and things, will basically have to remove China from their production pipelines and supply chains for their batteries, which will probably be very good for the entire global battery ecosystem, which will itself be very good for the future of electrification and the reduction of fossil fuels.

108
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,000
Scott: Sure, but the fundamental thing is that electric cars won't save us.

109
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,879
Scott: Only less cars will save us.

110
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:58,452
Rym: Oh, no, but at least electric...

111
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,199
Scott: The switching over to electric cars is sort of like a...

112
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:08,157
Rym: It is a transition, just like nuclear power is a transition, just to get us off of the even more egregious problems.

113
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,060
Scott: I mean, common logic suggests that that would work, right?

114
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,458
Scott: It's like, "Ah, yes, just switch the electric car, then...".

115
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:21,934
Scott: But it's like, in reality, switching to the electric car is probably just not going to be good enough.

116
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:30,379
Rym: Switching to the electric car will, in theory, it will not fix all the other externalities of cars that we both know about.

117
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:41,140
Rym: But just in terms of climate change, it will, at best, not make particulate pollution worse, but more likely it'll cause more particulate pollution than current cars.

118
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:48,100
Rym: Because electric cars are heavier, they generate more particulates, which mostly come from diesel, which we're also getting rid of, or tires.

119
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,487
Rym: But...

120
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,011
Scott: They still have tires.

121
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:51,636
Scott: Tires are the...

122
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:00,080
Rym: But they will definitely, and there's a lot of studies, I've seen that back this up, reduce CO2 emissions because of the economy of scale of electricity generation.

123
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,860
Scott: Well, not if you're just burning the fossil fuels somewhere else.

124
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:16,659
Rym: Actually, yes, because burning the fossil fuels in large power plants generate way less CO2 per unit burned than poorly maintained machines distributed across the entire country.

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,220
Scott: We'll have to do the math on that.

126
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,999
Scott: There's a lot of studies that say that.

127
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,460
Scott: You lose a lot of power in transmission, too, right?

128
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,660
Scott: And then you lose power when charging up the batteries.

129
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,899
Rym: Yeah, but the economy of scale of scrubbers...

130
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,940
Scott: If you burn the fuel right there in the engine, it's like, yeah, okay, maybe less...

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,140
Rym: Because the fuel is heavy, and transporting the fuel to then be distributed is way worse than transporting the batteries.

132
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,320
Rym: But mining batteries sucks shit, at least currently.

133
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,319
Scott: Yeah, well, you know what doesn't cause any of these problems at all?

134
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:48,099
Scott: Is any vehicle that's not a car.

135
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:50,619
Scott: Anything that doesn't have a motor.

136
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,900
Rym: But way back when we were talking about how, like, nothing can change in the US, you know, that whole... Skateboard.

137
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,480
Rym: Because, you know, since basically 1992, our government's been paralyzed by the Senate filibuster.

138
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:08,580
Rym: What's interesting is you had actually asked a question on the show that derailed us for a while.

139
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,939
Rym: And that question was basically, "Why don't they just bribe the two dipshits who are blocking all

140
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:16,060
Rym: this?".

141
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:17,359
Scott: Yeah, I did ask that.

142
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,678
Rym: So, and the answer for a long time was, "We seem to have tried, and it didn't work

143
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:21,820
Rym: out.".

144
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:29,380
Rym: So basically what happened here, they bribed Manchin, like dipshit number one, in a weird way.

145
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:31,280
Rym: He seemed to be against this.

146
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,599
Rym: He was publicly against this.

147
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:41,100
Rym: And I suspect that dipshit actually colluded with Chuck Schumer, who's the head of the Senate right now, and the Democrats.

148
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
Rym: Like, he runs the Senate on a technicality.

149
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:46,819
Rym: They basically, like, orchestrated this.

150
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:48,940
Rym: So Manchin said, "Nope, I'm not on board.

151
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,426
Rym: Fuck this

152
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:49,672
Rym: thing.".

153
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:59,300
Rym: So the Republicans basically agreed to let this other bill pass, and then have a reconciliation bill, because the Democrats agreed to not pull shenanigans with the reconciliation bill.

154
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:09,719
Rym: And the evil Republicans basically believed that was true, because they thought Joe Manchin, since any one Democrat could ruin it, was going to block it anyway, so they'd won.

155
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:19,818
Rym: As soon as they passed that first bill, Joe Manchin literally, that evening, issues a statement saying, "I support the reconciliation to pass the Infrastructure

156
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:20,059
Rym: Act.".

157
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:24,899
Rym: And then the only things blocking it would have been Sinema, dipshit number two.

158
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:30,020
Rym: Without the cover of Joe Manchin, Sinema actually just took a pretty simple bribe.

159
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:40,620
Rym: They removed, like, one provision around venture capital companies that she's probably entangled with, and then she stepped aside because she couldn't take the heat by herself, and it passed, and the Republicans are pissed.

160
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,038
Rym: They can't do anything about it.

161
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:50,010
Rym: The saddest thing is, this bill is probably the largest, most impactful, and most important thing the U.S.

162
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,660
Rym: Senate has done since Obamacare.

163
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,579
Rym: As little as it is, it's the biggest bill we've passed since then.

164
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:57,760
Scott: That's how sad we are, right?

165
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,075
Scott: It's like, "Ah, yes, we must climb up this mountain that is 10,000 meters tall.

166
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:09,035
Scott: That's how far we have to go for success, and the most we've ever climbed is 10 feet.

167
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,611
Scott: Congratulations, we just climbed 15

168
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:12,691
Scott: feet.".

169
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,174
Scott: Good job, everybody, 15 feet.

170
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:17,298
Rym: I think about that scene.

171
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:17,983
Scott: Only 90,990 feet to go.

172
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:21,660
Scott: I

173
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:35,620
Rym: think about that scene in The Terror, which I think was a GeekNights Book Club book a long time ago, where they're gonna abandon the ships and head off to try to get rescue, and they send a party ahead with those sledges, and they sledge all day, and it's like the most grueling work in the world.

174
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,580
Rym: They've exhausted themselves and ruined themselves, and at the end of the day, they're still within sight of the ships.

175
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:43,000
Rym: And that's the end of the chapter.

176
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:44,960
Rym: It feels like that sometimes.

177
00:11:45,281 --> 00:12:00,939
Rym: But the fact that this passed is kind of a big deal, because it means that at least one of those two dipshits was in fact bribeable, and for once, the Democrats were actually, for real, playing dirty with the tools that they had.

178
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,619
Rym: They were, and they did it, and it worked.

179
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,999
Scott: Yeah, so look, again, if you say that, that's only one conclusion, is that Scott was right.

180
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,019
Scott: Dipshits are still humans.

181
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,659
Scott: They have motivations of some kind.

182
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,900
Scott: They can be moved, right?

183
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:18,276
Scott: They're not robots.

184
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,678
Rym: But this is the interesting thing.

185
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,260
Scott: He can't be moved on most other things.

186
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,160
Rym: He moved on this one for probably some specific reason.

187
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,380
Scott: But there is some way to do it, right?

188
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:37,140
Scott: You just have to, you know, they're getting closer to figuring it out, because no one's going to tell you how to move them, right?

189
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:40,939
Scott: Oh yes, if you want to move me, you'll have to do it.

190
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:41,637
Scott: I mean, I do.

191
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:43,499
Rym: There's a price.

192
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,899
Rym: Anything that I'm willing to do for our price, I will state that price.

193
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,820
Scott: Sure, but not a lot of people do that.

194
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:51,019
Scott: It's very rare.

195
00:12:52,381 --> 00:13:03,720
Rym: So in the news, I'm sure you saw that a lot of people were Googling the term "neck robotic" over the last few weeks, because we all saw that terrifying video of a spider robot.

196
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,599
Rym: And basically, this is legit, this is a real thing.

197
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,500
Rym: Turns out spiders...

198
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:14,740
Scott: Next week, haha, how I made everyone believe my hoax about spider robots.

199
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:25,340
Rym: But apparently, spiders only have muscles to basically curl their legs in, and they actually use pneumatic systems to extend their legs.

200
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:27,619
Scott: Okay, I didn't know that.

201
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,640
Rym: Yeah, as opposed to humans and like mammals.

202
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:31,319
Scott: Where does the air come from?

203
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,240
Scott: They'd like breathe it in somewhere?

204
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,480
Rym: Yeah, I don't know all the details, but I've read like two articles about this.

205
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,660
Rym: I got one on the Smithsonian.

206
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:51,040
Rym: And they figured out that if you just take a dead spider and hook it up to a machine that is basically a pneumatic machine, you can use the spider as a little gripper crane.

207
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:59,640
Rym: And it turns out that a little dead spider can lift a hundred times its own body weight in extremely delicate, extremely controllable way.

208
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:07,320
Rym: And these spider grippers are better than like any sensitive gripper we could build with like non-biological components today.

209
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:26,259
Scott: Yeah, I mean, if you think about it, it's like most things that we make that are, you know, like mechanical devices are, have a single, you know, mode of like, you know, like, you know, it's like, oh, it's a, it's a lever made of metal or it's an elastic or it's a, it's a hydraulic pipe, right?

210
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:33,120
Scott: It's like, there's not a lot of like, I've never seen a machine that's like, oh yes, in that direction, it's pneumatic.

211
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:36,180
Scott: And in the other direction, it's elastic or something.

212
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:37,260
Scott: You don't see that, right?

213
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:46,460
Rym: But also the efficiency of biological systems, because really all our bodies are like all the crazy interesting stuff our bodies do are literally just tiny little molecular nanomachines.

214
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,520
Scott: But they're not hooking up to the spider's nervous system.

215
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:53,460
Scott: They're just stimulating its limbs directly.

216
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,860
Rym: Imagine they did this with a human.

217
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,517
Scott: They basically put a human on a spike.

218
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,720
Scott: They could just move your arms and legs around with, you know, electricity directly on your muscles, right?

219
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,278
Scott: Or some shit.

220
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:22,640
Rym: But, uh, this type of thing, necrobatics is sort of a transitionary step to understand these machines better, but the future of machinery, especially extremely advanced machinery, is definitely going to be inspired heavily by the literal micromachines that are inside of animals' bodies today.

221
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:28,620
Scott: I mean, that was what the fictional technology in BattleTech was, right?

222
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,820
Scott: Even though the BattleTech mechs walked around all boring and lumbering, right?

223
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,180
Scott: They weren't like Gundams or Evangelions.

224
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:42,840
Scott: They still were, you know, technically full of like, you know, this, like, uh, I forget what the word for, like, uh, Mayamur.

225
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,738
Scott: That's what they called it.

226
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,351
Scott: Mayamur.

227
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:45,219
Rym: Oh, yeah.

228
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,380
Rym: Right.

229
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,429
Scott: The clan had triple-strength Mayamur.

230
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:52,079
Scott: that was just better and lighter in every conceivable way.

231
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:59,840
Scott: But it was like, you know, that that's, you know, they weren't just like, uh, it's like if they had the triple-strength Mayamur, shouldn't they be moving like Gundams and Evas, right?

232
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:03,760
Scott: You know, but yeah, whatever.

233
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,759
Rym: Yeah, but this stuff is actually like, this is not just scientists doing something weird to write a paper.

234
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,320
Rym: This is very important research that's only going to accelerate.

235
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:20,820
Rym: In some other news, uh, talking about all these mergers and acquisitions, Amazon, we got to talk about this today.

236
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:24,637
Scott: Well, yeah, last time we talked about Amazon buying the doctor, right?

237
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,420
Scott: Now they're buying the robot.

238
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,638
Scott: They're going to make a doctor robot?

239
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:33,620
Rym: Well, specifically the Roomba, the robotic vacuum cleaner.

240
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:41,537
Scott: Yeah, the iRobot company, basically the company that made robot vacuums a thing is now owned by Amazon.

241
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,300
Rym: Now, it's fascinating because, you know, there's a lot of angles on this.

242
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Rym: One, I already am very suspicious of people who let Amazon put microphones that are always on all around their house and connect them to the Internet.

243
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:56,760
Scott: Yeah, or Google, right?

244
00:16:57,122 --> 00:17:00,300
Scott: The Apple one is kind of trustworthy, but also useless.

245
00:17:01,703 --> 00:17:03,639
Scott: It's like, I don't ever get any of those.

246
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,579
Rym: I have never told my iPhone to set a timer.

247
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:10,480
Rym: I just click on a timer on my watch and it just works.

248
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,919
Scott: I disable Siri and every voice activated thing on every device.

249
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,959
Rym: Yep, but here, so all right.

250
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:28,200
Rym: I imagine whatever privacy concerns this has is probably less than what the people who enable this have already led into their houses.

251
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:38,919
Rym: But it doesn't seem like it's a good idea to give Amazon access to data that is a literal map of your house, plus a map of like what areas are the dirtiest.

252
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:47,999
Rym: I feel like that data in aggregate will be used to drive even ever more terrifying advertising and products and such.

253
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:57,860
Scott: I mean, the vacuum detects pet hair and then starts, you know, and then Alexa tries to buy you some pet food and it's like, you know, it's like all that kind of shit.

254
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,279
Scott: You know, that's, you know, it's not like one medical where we had to like, you know, hypothesize like, what would Amazon do with this?

255
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:03,712
Scott: Right.

256
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:05,540
Scott: It's like, no, it's obvious what they're going to do with this.

257
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,880
Scott: The iRobot directly integrates with their Alexa's and the Ring door knobs and all their other house shit.

258
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,480
Rym: And I am a big fan of the concept of advanced home automation.

259
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:20,060
Rym: I'm just not a big fan of the Internet of shit.

260
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,060
Rym: Norm, I'm a big fan of having remote services running all of this for me.

261
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,298
Rym: I want to run it in my own house.

262
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:26,440
Scott: Right.

263
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,820
Rym: The way like this kind of technology should be designed.

264
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,059
Scott: I'm not a fan of it.

265
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,820
Scott: I think part of it is I never lived, you know, I never owned a house large enough.

266
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,340
Scott: I guess the house I grew up in was large enough, but the technology didn't exist then.

267
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:45,856
Rym: But I mean, if my house was just like the Star Trek, like computer, lower the temperature in the podcasting room, computer, raise the blinds.

268
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:48,598
Scott: I mean, they have that.

269
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:54,719
Rym: Yeah, well, they have that operated via all these external Internet of shit things.

270
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:08,140
Scott: But I'm just saying is that like it's even if you have it set up and it was local, it's like, you know, it's easier than saying, you know, like, hey, hey, Google, turn off the lights, fucking turning off the lights at the switch.

271
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:08,999
Scott: It's not better.

272
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,540
Scott: It has to be.

273
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,560
Scott: It's not better than the switch that you have.

274
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:13,140
Scott: It's like it has to be an improvement.

275
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:20,820
Rym: Well, the switch to turn on and off the main lighting in our living room is there's only one switch and is by the entrance to the living room way on the other side of the room.

276
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:22,940
Scott: Well, it's not my fault you got bad switches.

277
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,040
Scott: But the point is, what would be an improvement?

278
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:25,540
Scott: Right.

279
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,860
Scott: This is what I would like for home automation.

280
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:31,500
Scott: It needs to be where I don't have to tell I could program it initially.

281
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:31,893
Scott: That's right.

282
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,560
Scott: That's that's a worthwhile effort.

283
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:37,020
Scott: But afterwards, I shouldn't have to program it, for example.

284
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:37,680
Scott: Right.

285
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:41,393
Scott: Like if I if everyone leaves the house, it just turns all the lights and air conditioners off.

286
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:42,680
Scott: I don't have to say anything.

287
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,880
Scott: It's just do it right.

288
00:19:44,303 --> 00:19:46,359
Scott: If I if it's around bedtime.

289
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:47,060
Scott: Right.

290
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,459
Scott: It should start cooling the bedroom.

291
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:48,800
Scott: Right.

292
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,838
Scott: When everyone wakes up and leaves the bedroom, it should close the door and stop cooling the bedroom and wait and just cooling that for no reason, because no one's going to be in there.

293
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,058
Scott: Right.

294
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,860
Scott: All this that, you know, some of these some of these offerings do have some of those capabilities.

295
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,939
Rym: A lot of the smart thermostats were at least they claim to figure out your patterns and just adapt to that over time.

296
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:07,600
Scott: Right.

297
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,299
Scott: But the ones where I have to talk to it, it's like that's not an improvement over a switch or a button or.

298
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:18,840
Scott: But regardless, yeah, it's obvious that Amazon's going to do with these robots.

299
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:26,880
Scott: And but I think also, right, the robot technology could also probably be brought over to some of Amazon's other departments.

300
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,400
Scott: Like, you know, they keep trying to make delivery drones a thing.

301
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,778
Scott: I don't know if we'll see that in our lifetimes or if it'll just continue to be.

302
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,780
Rym: It's just fascinating how delivery drones are just a solution looking for a problem.

303
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:39,599
Scott: So just like coins.

304
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:45,480
Rym: Yeah, well, coins are just a money laundering scam and or a multilevel marketing scam.

305
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,480
Scott: They're also a solution looking for a problem.

306
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,459
Rym: Yeah, but I think the solution looking for a problem is actually just a thin veneer over what is directly a scam.

307
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,700
Scott: But also, you know, hey, you know, this this again, more buying is happening, more merging is happening.

308
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:00,479
Scott: Right.

309
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,280
Scott: Smaller companies, you know, someone who makes like robot vacuums.

310
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,419
Scott: It's like that's not really a necessity of life, even though they're pretty popular in an economic downturn.

311
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:12,500
Rym: I would definitely have robot vacuums because they do.

312
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:18,120
Scott: The only reason I don't have one is because, you know, it's a small place and the floor is not really conducive.

313
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,960
Scott: This is not going to really be able to clean very much.

314
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,239
Rym: It won't do better than I do.

315
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,559
Rym: Just sweeping once a day.

316
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:32,980
Scott: But the you know, it's like an economic downturn is not good for that kind of not necessary semi luxury product.

317
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:38,460
Scott: And that's what you're seeing get merged into some bigger company that can weather a storm.

318
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:39,699
Scott: It tires small.

319
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,379
Scott: Your small boat might survive normal times, but when there's a big storm coming, everyone ties the small boat to the cruise ship.

320
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:47,118
Scott: That'll be OK.

321
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,039
Rym: But that's the other problem with the, you know, a rapid descent towards cyber dystopia like Shadowrun without elves.

322
00:21:55,262 --> 00:21:58,740
Rym: This is Amazon's fourth largest acquisition ever.

323
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:02,140
Scott: So it is a big, successful company.

324
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:18,079
Rym: So the the other three in order are one Whole Foods for thirteen or fourteen billion in twenty seven, obviously, MGM, the movie studio in twenty twenty one, like recently for nine billion and one medical for four billion last year.

325
00:22:18,602 --> 00:22:23,919
Rym: They are accelerating their pace and the government is not keeping up with any sort of antitrust yet.

326
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:34,280
Scott: Well, there actually was some big tech antitrust bill that was making some progress, but it actually just faced some anti-progress like I saw the article about that like today or yesterday.

327
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:37,299
Scott: It was moving along and now it's not doing so well.

328
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,019
Rym: Part of what was happening and this is what sucks.

329
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:49,320
Rym: Tech companies, for all their other problems, tend to be more hostile to the Republicans and the conservatives than to progressives and liberals on most issues.

330
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,525
Rym: Obviously, there's a lot.

331
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:52,052
Rym: I'm not saying they're good companies.

332
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:54,076
Rym: do not in any way construe that.

333
00:22:54,702 --> 00:23:09,640
Rym: But there was a big movement, especially during the presidency, the former guy that's slowly petering out where Republicans and conservatives see feel threatened by the power of these technology companies that are in some ways very liberal.

334
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:23,996
Rym: And they were trying to wield antitrust to do things like force Twitter down so their shitty social networks can come up or force net neutrality rules to make sure conservatives can't be banned when they say racist things on like major platforms like.

335
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:27,840
Rym: they had a lot of ulterior motives for supporting the antitrust.

336
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,500
Rym: And as that's not panning out, if you don't have their support, it's not like progressives can do real good antitrust.

337
00:23:35,902 --> 00:23:41,400
Scott: So even the sort of more centrist Democrats were all in favor of, you know, the tech antitrust.

338
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:41,754
Scott: Oh, yeah.

339
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:55,279
Rym: But they still need dipshit Republicans on board because the thing we did to pass that bill, the one we just talked about, you can only do that once a year, maybe twice a year if you pull extremely difficult shenanigans.

340
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,020
Scott: Let's see what this article says.

341
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:03,060
Scott: Legislative clock ticks down on bill that would block largest tech companies from favoring their own products and services.

342
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,300
Rym: Yeah, really?

343
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,289
Rym: We just got to break them all up.

344
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:09,799
Rym: In some more news.

345
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,880
Rym: So this is a thread and I think it's pretty interesting.

346
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:27,660
Rym: It's worth talking about a little bit, but it's some analysis of a bunch of stuff that goes on in Netflix and how they use machine learning, but specifically around a use case of machine learning that is actually machine learning.

347
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,839
Rym: It isn't just people saying they're doing machine learning and then doing like a linear regression or nothing.

348
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:40,080
Rym: The statistic is that most people, the average person when they go to Netflix, they'll scroll around for 90 seconds.

349
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,460
Rym: And if they don't see something that they're going to watch, they'll navigate away.

350
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:46,779
Rym: Like that was their attempt to watch something that day.

351
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:48,320
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

352
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,279
Scott: I mean, people, I do it too.

353
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:52,020
Scott: I'm guilty as charged, right?

354
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,420
Scott: It's like when I had streaming services, right?

355
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:57,400
Scott: I'd be in the mood to watch something, but I don't know what.

356
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,500
Scott: And so, but you know, and it's like if I don't have it, if there isn't something on my mind that I want to watch, right?

357
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,180
Scott: That I, but I was still in a mood to watch, but it's not like the old days where your choices are limited on television.

358
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,340
Scott: So you would flip through channels until you found the best option.

359
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,200
Rym: Or even the Beacon days.

360
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,920
Rym: We have the three Netflix DVDs that we have checked out right now.

361
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,259
Rym: Which of the three will we watch?

362
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,220
Scott: It's instead, it's the paradox of choice there.

363
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,460
Scott: You turn on any, even if you only have one streaming service, there are so many choices, right?

364
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:31,698
Scott: If they only just showed you three things and said, that's it, pick one of these three, it would be easier to pick, just pick one.

365
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:33,640
Scott: But there's a thousand million things.

366
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,919
Scott: It's like, all right, so I keep flipping through them.

367
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:40,120
Scott: And, and sometimes there is one that's like, ah, yes, perfect.

368
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:40,820
Scott: Right.

369
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:44,140
Scott: But then most of the time there isn't.

370
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,678
Scott: And you spend a lot of the amount of time you spend flipping, you could have spent watching a whole thing.

371
00:25:48,822 --> 00:25:48,935
Scott: Yup.

372
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:58,780
Rym: So it appears, well, even worse in the, there's sometimes we used to get into the rut of, we watch trailers and then we've watched basically a show's worth of trailers.

373
00:25:59,245 --> 00:25:59,958
Rym: And then we just stop.

374
00:26:00,506 --> 00:26:01,300
Rym: We watched a bunch of trailers.

375
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:01,980
Rym: That was all we watched.

376
00:26:02,382 --> 00:26:05,500
Rym: So people seem to choose something.

377
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,376
Rym: If they watch anything on Netflix, the only thing that influences them on average is the thumbnails.

378
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,340
Scott: And unless you've heard of it, unless you know what it is, the thumbnail is giving you all the information, right?

379
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,999
Scott: And you're not, there's a description, but you don't read the description unless the thumbnail is good enough for you to click on.

380
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:29,416
Rym: And according to this thread, an average user will look at any given thumbnail for 1.8 seconds.

381
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:31,120
Scott: That's a longer than I thought.

382
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:32,400
Scott: That'd be like milliseconds.

383
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,620
Rym: So, I mean, I don't know if you and I are necessarily the median example of anything related to media consumption.

384
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,160
Scott: I guess, suppose the title also matters, but the title's in the thumbnail.

385
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,652
Rym: And this thread goes into all this ridiculous analysis.

386
00:26:45,692 --> 00:26:49,220
Rym: for basically Netflix generates its own thumbnails using machine learning.

387
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,499
Rym: They don't use what the people who make shows like give them.

388
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,260
Rym: They don't use official art.

389
00:26:54,541 --> 00:27:02,099
Rym: They generate thumbnails with machine learning algorithms based on the data they have over what kinds of thumbnails people click on.

390
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:10,660
Rym: And the terrifying thing is this appears to be like radically, extremely, almost deterministically effective.

391
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:24,660
Rym: Like kind of like that study that showed a YouTube thumbnail that is a white face making a extreme overreaction to something with big text objectively gets more clicks than any other type of thumbnail regardless of content.

392
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:26,319
Rym: Same thing on Netflix.

393
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:32,040
Rym: So the machine learning algorithm settled on some really interesting things.

394
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:41,259
Rym: And this thread talks about exactly what the algorithm is looking for, how it generates them, how it will give you a different thumbnail from someone else based on your past watching history with examples.

395
00:27:42,382 --> 00:27:48,599
Rym: So like if I look at a show and you look at a show, it'll show us a different thumbnail if we've watched different stuff.

396
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:56,657
Rym: And the funniest one is the more characters there are on a thumbnail, the less likely it is that anyone will look at it.

397
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,720
Scott: And if there's something that everyone knows that everyone hates reading.

398
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:08,859
Rym: Yeah, but like a thumbnail has three characters or four characters, way fewer people will even look at that show than one that just has one character on it.

399
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:13,360
Rym: And the nuts example was they took two radically different viewer histories.

400
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:21,880
Rym: And if one set of people look at Pulp Fiction, they see the actual Pulp Fiction like movie poster that we all remember.

401
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:33,920
Rym: But someone who has watched like a bunch of other types of media, they will see a thumbnail that is weird and almost makes Pulp Fiction look like a completely different movie.

402
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:53,780
Rym: And you can read this thread to see all the details, but I still don't think this type of algorithmic manipulation of humans is particularly healthy, nor is this ecosystem necessarily not just a self-referencing and self-propagating thing.

403
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:59,077
Rym: I feel like the algorithms are driving people toward what the algorithms want people to watch.

404
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,660
Rym: I think that this is not just the passive discovery of habits.

405
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:04,660
Rym: I think this is driving behaviors.

406
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:11,439
Scott: The thing I never really understood is like if you're Netflix, you don't make more money when people watch more shit.

407
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:15,200
Scott: You just have to have someone watching enough that they don't unsubscribe.

408
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:16,932
Rym: And that's the goal of this.

409
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,720
Scott: So it's like you don't care what they watch.

410
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,340
Scott: There's no reason to drive someone watching one thing or another.

411
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,579
Rym: They do not care what you watch.

412
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:32,940
Rym: All they care about is, whatever you care about, how do we get you to click on something within 90 seconds?

413
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:34,800
Rym: And that's all the algorithms doing.

414
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:39,420
Rym: It looks at Scott and says, what would Scott click on in the next 90 seconds right now?

415
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:40,976
Rym: And that is what it's trying to figure out.

416
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,224
Scott: Hmm.

417
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:49,179
Rym: I wonder what's going to happen if I get into a habit of canceling in my Netflix account, making a new one, canceling it.

418
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,979
Rym: Do they keep the data?

419
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,499
Rym: What if I give them a GDPR request every time?

420
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:55,900
Scott: If you reinstate your account quickly enough, they don't delete it yet.

421
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:56,519
Scott: You get it back.

422
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,438
Scott: You get everything back.

423
00:29:57,901 --> 00:30:02,240
Scott: But if you let it go long enough, eventually they get rid of it completely and you have to start from nothing again.

424
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,020
Rym: You can also force them to start from nothing.

425
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,440
Scott: I forget what the time period is, but.

426
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,079
Rym: If you tell them that per the GDPR you want all your personal data removed, they have to remove it all.

427
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:13,017
Scott: Yeah, they do that.

428
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:13,663
Rym: Yup.

429
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,430
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

430
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:23,229
Rym: FTL, pretty good game.

431
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,450
Rym: Pretty old at this point, but it's out there.

432
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,490
Rym: Fun little rogue-like space game.

433
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,350
Rym: And this video, I just bumped into this randomly.

434
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,529
Rym: It's a cute little video.

435
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,749
Rym: It's like three minutes long.

436
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,130
Rym: And someone, it's sort of two things I like combined into one video.

437
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:45,309
Rym: One thing I like is when someone takes a video game and does something extreme in it and documents what that's like.

438
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,850
Rym: Kind of like a speed runner, like doing something crazy.

439
00:30:48,951 --> 00:30:55,670
Rym: But the other thing I like is when someone tells a little story, almost like a machinima, like makes a narrative using the mechanics of a game.

440
00:30:56,212 --> 00:30:59,330
Rym: And this is a cute little video that's animated and set to music.

441
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:04,810
Rym: That is, someone made a ship and all this ship does is start fires.

442
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:06,308
Rym: That's all it can do.

443
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:08,950
Rym: Their entire build is just, it starts fires.

444
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:12,590
Rym: And this ended up being actually really funny to watch.

445
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:15,666
Rym: That's what he got.

446
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:28,670
Scott: So, you know, when you watch movies, especially movies that are depicting an older time period in Eastern Asia, there's usually scenes of people planting rice, right?

447
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,630
Rym: Evangelion dwelled on that for like three hours in the middle.

448
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:33,148
Scott: Right.

449
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:46,144
Scott: It's always that really stereotypical, sometimes racist scene of, you know, people and hats, in a muddy field, you know, on their backpack, they got a ton of rice, you know, seedlings hunched over, right?

450
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,990
Scott: They put one rice in the ground to take a step backwards.

451
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,310
Scott: They put a rice in the ground to take a step backwards, right?

452
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,630
Scott: And that is the way people planted rice for a long time.

453
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:05,589
Scott: And I'm sure some places on earth, people might still be planting rice that way, but clearly with the amount of rice that is eaten and by humans on the earth, that is not how all the rice can be planted.

454
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:07,669
Scott: It would not be enough rice.

455
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:09,950
Scott: How is it actually done?

456
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,850
Scott: Obviously, there's some sort of agricultural rice planting machine that does the work.

457
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:16,850
Scott: Have you ever seen this machine?

458
00:32:17,391 --> 00:32:20,930
Scott: I haven't seen the machine yet until I saw this video.

459
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,970
Scott: I don't know if this is like the best possible machine.

460
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,130
Scott: There may be other ones that are better, newer, fancier, right?

461
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,069
Scott: This one's kind of small.

462
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:33,910
Scott: It's like just two people, but it is still an incredibly impressive machine.

463
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:37,390
Scott: And actually what's happening in the video is they have two rice fields, right?

464
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:49,060
Scott: The first rice field, they just sort of plant that, I presume, the way that you plant like grass where you just sort of toss seeds around and they just toss a lot of seeds around and you get them growing really dead

465
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,865
Rym: to that with rice

466
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:50,610
Scott: and you get lots.

467
00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:52,407
Scott: That's right, right.

468
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,189
Scott: But you get the seedlings that way.

469
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:59,685
Scott: Then they roll up the seedlings like sod and like a little like little bundles, like little rolls.

470
00:33:00,371 --> 00:33:08,430
Scott: And then the machine is actually they're sort of putting the rolls of densely packed rice in the machine, sort of like ammunition.

471
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:22,269
Scott: And then they take the machine to a separate muddy field where it then takes all those seedlings and plants them in a more spread out fashion so that they can grow to full size rice plants without crowding each other out.

472
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:29,910
Scott: So it's like there's a field for the first stage where it's dense and then big ass fields to transplant everything.

473
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,170
Scott: And the transplanting is very impressive machine.

474
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:35,840
Rym: Plus, apparently there's a big like.

475
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,530
Rym: I don't know all the details, but rice needs one type of environment to germinate.

476
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:42,050
Rym: But then it prefers to grow in a very different environment.

477
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:43,182
Rym: And there's lots.

478
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:49,230
Rym: How did rice grow without not in the not in anywhere near the quantity we need it to?

479
00:33:51,451 --> 00:33:53,250
Rym: It also has a lot of other problems.

480
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,970
Rym: Some of this is to help it be free of disease and bacteria.

481
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:58,850
Rym: There's a lot of stuff going on here.

482
00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:00,610
Rym: There's also a problem with rice.

483
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:06,630
Rym: Rice cultivation is increasingly pulling our stick out of the ground in increasingly bad like high quantities.

484
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:13,989
Rym: And rice is actually getting not quite dangerous to eat yet, but it's not great necessarily for young kids anywhere in the world.

485
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,188
Rym: There's nowhere you can grow it.

486
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,290
Rym: This isn't a problem, I guess.

487
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:26,109
Rym: So even if you buy the fair is still a lot more arsenic in rice than in pretty much any other cereal grain or like basically any grain.

488
00:34:27,853 --> 00:34:28,909
Scott: Yeah, fascinating.

489
00:34:30,212 --> 00:34:31,650
Rym: The Metamoment, the Geek God's Book Club book.

490
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,449
Rym: We will do the episode on Thursday next week.

491
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,328
Rym: This book will take you.

492
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:35,266
Rym: It's a novella.

493
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,110
Rym: Maybe a couple hours to read.

494
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,449
Scott: I didn't start reading it yet, though.

495
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,090
Scott: I did inspire you.

496
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,190
Scott: You'll probably read it.

497
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,728
Rym: Knowing you, you'll read it in one sitting.

498
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,330
Rym: You'll sit down.

499
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:44,027
Rym: You'll start reading it.

500
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:44,728
Rym: You'll be done.

501
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:46,150
Scott: Probably.

502
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,108
Rym: But when will that sitting rain coming up in the next week or two?

503
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,027
Rym: Week and a half?

504
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:51,507
Scott: We'll see.

505
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,097
Rym: I'll be alive at PAX West.

506
00:34:53,197 --> 00:34:54,364
Rym: Sunday, September 4th, 1230 p.m.

507
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:55,969
Rym: Sasquatch Theater.

508
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:56,770
Scott: Losing.

509
00:34:57,892 --> 00:34:59,230
Rym: TBD on other cons.

510
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,749
Rym: I saw Magfest drop their dates.

511
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,750
Rym: It's in January.

512
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,670
Rym: They said it'll be masked and require VAXes just like before.

513
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,605
Rym: We'll see how the world is.

514
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,568
Rym: We'll see if we got boosters by then.

515
00:35:10,372 --> 00:35:11,390
Rym: You know, I'm key.

516
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:17,789
Rym: We're still continuing to not make commitments to things that are too far in the future because who knows what the future is going to be like.

517
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,089
Scott: Let me check the numbers.

518
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:22,448
Scott: They don't look good.

519
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,510
Rym: The worst part is the numbers don't even get tracked that well anymore.

520
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:27,934
Scott: Yep.

521
00:35:28,882 --> 00:35:35,300
Scott: I mean, I just had a coworker at the new job just posted on Slack that their kid is at summer camp, but tested positive.

522
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,312
Scott: And now that's it.

523
00:35:37,082 --> 00:35:38,239
Scott: Summer camp's over for them.

524
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:38,957
Scott: They're coming home.

525
00:35:40,122 --> 00:35:47,080
Scott: And even though who knows if it's a mild or serious case or whatever, but it's like, shouldn't you just set the summer camp down if one person had it?

526
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:52,039
Rym: I have like more than 10 coworkers who tested positive like in the last week or two.

527
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:56,740
Rym: All of them definitely got it from their kids who were at camp.

528
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,759
Rym: That what worries me is that does not bode well for September when school starts.

529
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,632
Scott: There is a new coworker who started like.

530
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,060
Scott: I'm only been there a month, right?

531
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,959
Scott: But a coworker started like a week after me.

532
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:19,196
Scott: And they started the job with COVID and to even into even today, they're like, I'm 85% of the way to being, you know, they're like, they're still 15% sick.

533
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:20,719
Scott: It's like, really?

534
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:30,380
Scott: Uh, I'm going to continue being extremely cautious self that has gotten me, you know, other people look at me and they're like, oh, you're being too cautious.

535
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,379
Scott: But meanwhile, I've had zero COVID so far.

536
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:39,599
Rym: So I had my one COVID and that was when I went on a business trip to a convention in the UK that I, that I wouldn't do.

537
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:42,120
Rym: So yeah.

538
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:44,340
Rym: Otherwise just, you know, keep an eye on your internet stuff.

539
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,538
Rym: Websites coming along.

540
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,039
Rym: Other stuff's coming along.

541
00:36:47,462 --> 00:36:48,898
Rym: I guess we can just get into the main bit.

542
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,520
Rym: Kirby's vacuum cleaners.

543
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,119
Rym: The listener suggested this back in like July and it's not the worst idea.

544
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,553
Scott: Uh, I mean, it's not the worst idea, but it's like, what do I got to say about the end?

545
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:14,482
Rym: So, uh, you know, so I was just at work, so we were planning some sort of big meeting and let's just say one person was trying to like put together a deck and like kick off the meeting.

546
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:20,680
Rym: and there they basically did the Homer Simpson, the, since the dawn of time, man has tried.

547
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:27,060
Rym: So I can almost start here is since the dawn of time, man has tried to clean up the floor in the place they live.

548
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:35,099
Rym: I don't think we're going to talk about the history of vacuum cleaners because you can literally go, you can go to Wikipedia and your cup overfloweth.

549
00:37:37,185 --> 00:37:38,239
Scott: And I also don't know it.

550
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,580
Scott: I don't know anything about it.

551
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:53,400
Rym: What I can say is vacuum cleaners for me personally were very important and like just a thing that were a big deal in my life until I moved to New York city where now I don't have carpet, like wall to wall carpet.

552
00:37:54,101 --> 00:38:07,900
Rym: And now vacuum cleaners are very much a like semi-specialty tool as opposed to something that is like looming large in my life being used nearly every day, like a utility, an appliance almost in the house.

553
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:10,779
Rym: Now it's just like a little thing to use sometimes to clean up a little mess.

554
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:19,909
Scott: I mean, I had vacuum, you know, wherever I lived, a vacuum was like an essential thing to own.

555
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:25,029
Scott: I had one and, you know, I used it more or less.

556
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:37,270
Scott: I changed the bag if it was a bag kind that got, if it got full and, you know, I used only some of the tools and most of those tools never really worked that well.

557
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:42,970
Rym: I use that corner edger, like the super point one for almost everything, unless I was just vacuum vacuuming.

558
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:53,390
Scott: I think a lot of them are for, you know, if you have a big house with lots of like, you curtains and all sorts of different things, then a lot of the tools suddenly make sense.

559
00:38:53,531 --> 00:39:02,190
Scott: But it's like if you live in a more simple living place that doesn't have like this wide variety of things to be vacuumed, that a lot of those tools are just sort of unnecessary.

560
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:07,970
Rym: But a big part of this too is when I was a kid, you know, I grew up in the Midwest and there's a lot of interesting things about the Midwest.

561
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:32,004
Rym: But two things that are relevant to this conversation is one, the vast majority of people in the entire American Midwest generally wear their shoes in their own house and in other people's houses like that is just the default to the point that like as a kid we go to houses and if you started to take your shoes off, like the mom would come over and be like, no, no, no, do not take your shoes off like they would not let you take your shoes off in their house.

562
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:38,610
Rym: And two, most houses had a wall to wall carpet in nearly every room.

563
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:46,149
Rym: I even lived in a house at one point that had carpet in the downstairs bathroom, just full thick carpet.

564
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:56,090
Rym: And if you have carpet like that, like real carpet that has like the under layer and then like real carpet on the top, there's really no way to clean that except a vacuum cleaner.

565
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,249
Rym: Like you can't sweep that.

566
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:03,250
Rym: There's literally no way to get dirt out of that stuff except with a real big vacuum cleaner.

567
00:40:05,332 --> 00:40:09,709
Rym: Kind of glad that I live in the city now where most people prefer hardwood or tile and there's no carpet.

568
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:22,590
Scott: Well, I think I think hardwood and tile are more popular even outside the city nowadays, you're only seeing, you know, at least in more contemporary homes, I think you're really just seeing carpet on like a bedroom, right?

569
00:40:22,831 --> 00:40:29,110
Scott: Or maybe like a finished basement might have the thin carpet because no one wants to walk on a concrete floor, right?

570
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,510
Scott: But not necessarily could be some other kind of surface.

571
00:40:32,211 --> 00:40:40,349
Rym: I always lived in houses where every room had carpet except like the kitchen and like the dirt rooms in the garage until I moved to the city.

572
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:56,200
Scott: I mean, I guess I mean, even in Beacon, other than the kitchen, the house that I grew up in, the house that I grew up in had carpet in the amount of carpet that was in there.

573
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,280
Scott: It wasn't every room, right?

574
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,822
Scott: There were basically.

575
00:40:57,842 --> 00:41:01,300
Scott: there were hardwood floors that were nice ish underneath the carpet.

576
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:08,579
Scott: So it's basically when the house was built, the wood was in style, then carpet came in style and was installed on top.

577
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:14,758
Scott: And over at during the time we lived there, the carpet was removed, I think from all but two rooms, maybe.

578
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:16,158
Scott: Right.

579
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,960
Scott: So it's like as we lived there, we changed carpet in a couple of times.

580
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,340
Scott: But yeah, there was carpet was removed from from rooms.

581
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:36,230
Rym: Yeah, I remember every time we moved, we would get a new vacuum cleaner and we would also replace all the carpet in any house we moved into, like no matter what, like we replace it all.

582
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,979
Scott: But you can't trust that.

583
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,396
Scott: You can't.

584
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:41,439
Rym: I mean, a decade of someone else's feet.

585
00:41:42,552 --> 00:41:42,879
Rym: Not a big.

586
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:44,446
Scott: But you can.

587
00:41:44,466 --> 00:41:46,180
Scott: you can vacuum hardwood floor to a degree.

588
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,899
Scott: You don't just vacuum.

589
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,820
Rym: You do need the right kind of vacuum, though.

590
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,860
Rym: That's where like the vacuums.

591
00:41:51,782 --> 00:41:53,900
Scott: Yeah, my vacuum has multiple different heads.

592
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,640
Scott: It's got it right.

593
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,300
Scott: It has one with a spinny brush, one that I use on the rug.

594
00:41:57,701 --> 00:42:01,480
Scott: And then it's got a spinny, you know, sort of softy like a roller.

595
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:03,860
Scott: It looks almost like a paint roller, but it's softer.

596
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,900
Scott: And I use that on the hardwood.

597
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,200
Scott: It's a hardwood floor thing.

598
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,658
Rym: When I was a kid, we basically we had giant, upright vacuums that had like all these different settings on them.

599
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:14,516
Rym: And you'd even set it to a different height, depending on how thick the carpet was in a given room.

600
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,611
Rym: At one point, my parents got a hold of.

601
00:42:18,632 --> 00:42:20,560
Rym: I don't think they bought it from the company.

602
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:22,860
Rym: And I'm not going to say this company is a scam.

603
00:42:23,461 --> 00:42:27,080
Rym: I'm not opening myself up to any libel or slander of any kind.

604
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:30,009
Rym: But I will just link to the fact that there is on.

605
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:35,620
Rym: the Kirby is a brand of vacuum cleaner, also a cute pink guy who is a vacuum.

606
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:56,719
Rym: And the Kirby's are let's just say kirby.com, the company that like sells these vacuum cleaners, which they mostly sell door to door, has an entire page on their official website whose URL is kirby.com/sellingkirbyvacuumsisnotascam.

607
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:07,669
Rym: Draw what conclusions you may from a business that has to tell you they're not a scam and has a fact about how they are not a scam.

608
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:12,010
Scott: But I was very suspicious when I was a kid.

609
00:43:12,251 --> 00:43:15,110
Scott: There were TV commercials for a brand of vacuums.

610
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,130
Rym: Or I remember seeing those around.

611
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:18,789
Rym: I got some demonstrations of those.

612
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:19,508
Rym: Right.

613
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,550
Scott: So I never used one or right.

614
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:24,133
Scott: It was just.

615
00:43:24,274 --> 00:43:26,410
Scott: I'm just a memorable TV commercial, right?

616
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:31,250
Scott: Because I was at an impressionable young brain and the commercials are on all the time, like watching Price is Right.

617
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:32,525
Scott: And so I'm trying to sell you vacuums.

618
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:37,530
Scott: But they basically they were marketed as these are the vacuums that hotels use.

619
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,030
Scott: They looked like they were, you know, commercial.

620
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,030
Scott: They didn't look like something that you would find in a home.

621
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,490
Scott: They look like something you would find in a commercial setting.

622
00:43:44,996 --> 00:43:45,249
Scott: Right.

623
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:48,630
Scott: And they you know, they're like, oh, it's the best vacuum.

624
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,349
Scott: Oh, so good.

625
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,130
Scott: Much better than the vacuum you're going to buy the you know, the department store.

626
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:53,690
Scott: Right.

627
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:54,770
Scott: Get one of these babies.

628
00:43:55,177 --> 00:43:55,430
Scott: Right.

629
00:43:55,751 --> 00:43:57,610
Scott: And the real expensive way more.

630
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,410
Scott: It's like and I never know anyone who owned one.

631
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:01,890
Scott: I didn't know if they were actually better.

632
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:04,830
Scott: I assume they were a scam because why were they trying so hard?

633
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,729
Scott: If they were so good, why do they need to buy all these ads?

634
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:07,950
Scott: The other vacuums.

635
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,690
Rym: But we ended up getting a hold of one of these things.

636
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:11,790
Rym: And these are way overpriced.

637
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:13,350
Rym: Like nobody needs a vacuum like that.

638
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:26,269
Rym: But I got to say a good if you have a big house, a good high quality vacuum is really important because crappy vacuums just don't work like cheap ones just don't work at all.

639
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:33,030
Rym: They might work in like a local area, but like vacuum all the entire living room and it just won't get stuff out of the carpet.

640
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,650
Rym: Like it just won't work on the hardwood.

641
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,410
Rym: My whole life, cheap vacuums are worse than no vacuum.

642
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:43,490
Scott: Yeah, there are a lot of things that can cause a vacuum to fail, right?

643
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,789
Scott: It's like even the highest quality vacuums.

644
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,378
Scott: It's like, you know, they're.

645
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:49,350
Scott: you know, they have lots of moving parts.

646
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:52,710
Scott: You know, it's a lot of power going in the motor, right?

647
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:58,470
Scott: You know, you got you got lots of opportunities for the filth coming into the vacuum to mess up the vacuum, right?

648
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,590
Scott: All kinds of pet hair being the worst offender.

649
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:06,053
Scott: You know, all kinds of other things might get sucked in there and then they, you know, it's not.

650
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:09,930
Scott: the vacuum is not immune to the things that it sucks in, right?

651
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:18,170
Scott: So it's like the higher quality the vacuum, the more the longer it's going to last, the better it's going to clean, et cetera.

652
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:23,849
Scott: It's just, you know, check your check a reliable source for knowing which ones are actually better.

653
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:25,010
Rym: And I have seen the difference.

654
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:31,790
Rym: Like I remember we like we vacuum the house every day because we had dogs and birds and hamsters and I was just full of animals.

655
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,690
Rym: So we had to vacuum literally every day.

656
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:39,426
Rym: My entire childhood, someone's chore every single day was to vacuum the entire house at least once.

657
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:55,610
Rym: And I remember when we got a new vacuum, I was in like elementary school and we vacuumed with it the first time and all the carpets like slightly changed color and the bag basically filled up and we were all like, oh, shit, that old vacuum just wasn't working.

658
00:45:57,612 --> 00:46:01,548
Rym: It was it was gross and terrifying when we ran that new vacuum the first time.

659
00:46:03,842 --> 00:46:04,070
Scott: All right.

660
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,749
Scott: I guess let's let's do the easy thing.

661
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:13,470
Rym: First, my favorite type you can alternate is the shop vac, the kind of vacuum that if I had a house, I wish I had a shop vac.

662
00:46:13,931 --> 00:46:18,590
Rym: But living in an apartment, there is no way it is worth the space to keep a shop vac.

663
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:19,729
Rym: The deal is shop vacs.

664
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,683
Scott: A shop vac is a really unique kind of vacuum because it can.

665
00:46:23,703 --> 00:46:27,950
Scott: basically the sucking is the vacuum is on the top part.

666
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,690
Scott: It's then the bottom part is just a bucket.

667
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:30,790
Scott: It's just a bucket.

668
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:31,849
Scott: There is nothing down there.

669
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:32,170
Scott: Right.

670
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:35,830
Scott: So you can suck anything with a shop vac.

671
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:43,488
Scott: Pretty much water, water, fire, anything like if it can fit in the hose and even better suck it in.

672
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:46,728
Scott: It's just a universal sucker until the bucket is better.

673
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:52,090
Rym: You can just unplug the sucker hose, stick it into the other side of the shop vac.

674
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:52,949
Rym: And now you got a blower.

675
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:58,930
Rym: In fact, you could use it blowing and sucking simultaneously if you have a fancy one.

676
00:46:59,390 --> 00:46:59,848
Rym: And you know what?

677
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:00,953
Rym: If you have a house

678
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:03,201
Scott: and the bucket is just like

679
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:22,210
Rym: a house or a garage, or if you do anything that you could do in a place bigger than a New York City apartment, a shop vac is an indispensable tool because even if you don't use it that often, if you're ever in a situation where a shop vac was the answer, the worst thing in the world is not having a shop vac right at that moment.

680
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:29,867
Rym: Because there is no way to get a shop vac in time to deal with a shop vac situation if you don't already have one.

681
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:32,226
Scott: Yeah.

682
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,904
Scott: If you only have a regular vacuum, there are certain situations.

683
00:47:34,944 --> 00:47:38,250
Scott: you got to vacuum something and you can't vacuum it with a regular vacuum.

684
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,410
Rym: I do shop vacs to pump water out of basements.

685
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,128
Scott: Shop vacs can suck anything.

686
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,350
Scott: It's basically.

687
00:47:43,692 --> 00:47:43,940
Scott: It's easy.

688
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:48,110
Rym: I do shop vacs to just like suck sawdust off of a project.

689
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:53,849
Rym: Like I'm cutting wood and the shop vacs just running with the hose pointed at the blade, sucking all the sawdust away so I don't breathe it.

690
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:54,644
Scott: Yeah.

691
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:55,695
Scott: Right.

692
00:47:56,090 --> 00:48:03,589
Scott: And because it's a bucket with just a long hose and a lot of sucking power, you can use it for a lot of say normal things that a normal vacuum could do.

693
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:08,570
Scott: But the the the shape and you know, the the ergonomics, I guess.

694
00:48:08,771 --> 00:48:08,960
Scott: Let's see.

695
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,603
Scott: Vacuuming out the inside of a car or.

696
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:18,910
Rym: But it's especially things where you're not trying to pick up dust and normal dirt.

697
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:22,230
Rym: You're trying to pick up effectively liquid or debris.

698
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:30,670
Rym: Like it's not going to get the dust off of the things in your car, but it'll get all that schmutz that's built up in like the seams of your car seats.

699
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:32,771
Rym: See, what about?

700
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:33,856
Rym: so the crazy things.

701
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:36,970
Rym: I've used shop vacs for a bunch of pennies.

702
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:44,550
Rym: Once I spilled shit, I basically knocked over a bucket of small screws once in a workshop.

703
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:48,349
Rym: So I used a shop vac to vacuum them all up into a bucket to get them off the floor.

704
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,588
Rym: Water sawdust as.

705
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:54,410
Scott: It's good.

706
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:55,030
Scott: It's good.

707
00:48:55,250 --> 00:49:01,610
Scott: You know, like it usually if you break like a glass, right, you would have to pick up the big pieces of the normal vacuum, the small pieces.

708
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:05,910
Rym: But a shop vac and I have backed up broken glass many times in my life.

709
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:06,767
Rym: It just works.

710
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:14,130
Rym: But they will just spew dust into your house unless you have a very nice one with filters.

711
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:17,030
Scott: Even then, that's why it's a shop.

712
00:49:17,091 --> 00:49:17,829
Scott: You don't use it to vac.

713
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:18,570
Scott: That's why it's a shop.

714
00:49:18,894 --> 00:49:19,350
Scott: It's not a house.

715
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:26,129
Rym: So then there's the traditional upright vacuum that most American households have, which weren't super common outside of us.

716
00:49:26,592 --> 00:49:28,790
Scott: I think the upright vacuum has gone out of style.

717
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,781
Scott: Personally, I haven't seen them lately around.

718
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:35,970
Scott: and the upright vacuum is basically on the one hand, it's a single unit, right?

719
00:49:36,112 --> 00:49:37,630
Scott: And it's sort of straightforward, right?

720
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:44,264
Scott: You know, it's like you plug it in or it's battery powered, maybe, but usually plug in and it's going to handle along at.

721
00:49:44,324 --> 00:49:45,070
Scott: the bag is big.

722
00:49:45,211 --> 00:49:45,808
Scott: It's nice and long.

723
00:49:46,355 --> 00:49:47,209
Scott: It's attached to the handle.

724
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,210
Rym: Upright vacuums are still very are predominantly.

725
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,909
Rym: They're the predominant type of vacuum.

726
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:57,310
Rym: And they're very popular in the US and Britain and pretty much nowhere else on Earth.

727
00:49:57,571 --> 00:50:01,370
Rym: They coincide with places that historically mostly have wall to wall carpet.

728
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,070
Scott: So there you go.

729
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:08,348
Scott: But the thing I don't like about the upright vacuum is that you're moving.

730
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:12,530
Scott: You can only really vacuum like in place, you know, floors.

731
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:13,990
Scott: It can't vacuum really anything else.

732
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:18,361
Rym: Some of them might have never had an upright vacuum that did not have a hose hole built into it.

733
00:50:19,659 --> 00:50:19,909
Rym: Never.

734
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:20,843
Scott: Yeah.

735
00:50:22,831 --> 00:50:31,564
Scott: But the thing is, is with the upright vacuum, you're pushing around all like the bag is filling and it's like, oh, you never use a nice around the one.

736
00:50:31,664 --> 00:50:36,089
Rym: we had had a motor in it and it would drive forward and backward with a clutch.

737
00:50:36,712 --> 00:50:37,910
Scott: Yeah, they could drive.

738
00:50:38,432 --> 00:50:43,949
Scott: They can drive a little bit, but you're still pushing around the whole big fucking thing everywhere you go.

739
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:45,929
Scott: The canister vacuum.

740
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:50,370
Rym: I would disagree because I spent a lot of my childhood doing a lot of vacuuming in the Midwest.

741
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,449
Rym: The canisters were a pain in the ass because you had to roll the fucking thing around and it was getting heavy.

742
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,549
Rym: The upright kind of just drove itself.

743
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,029
Scott: You don't have to move.

744
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:01,590
Scott: You just move the canister into the room and the hose is a hose.

745
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:05,221
Scott: And you don't have my house just so big that you had to move that all around the fucking room.

746
00:51:05,632 --> 00:51:07,850
Rym: The hoses are not that long on up on canisters.

747
00:51:08,111 --> 00:51:10,430
Scott: It's not any heavier than the upright thing.

748
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:17,890
Scott: It's like you can vacuum all around within a great distance of the canister, which is holding light tools and getting into all kinds of places.

749
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:26,118
Rym: Canister vacuums are things are the predominant vacuum in Europe and nowhere else common in the US.

750
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:27,197
Scott: We had one in.

751
00:51:28,582 --> 00:51:31,600
Scott: I mean, we had one in college and we brought it to a beacon.

752
00:51:31,901 --> 00:51:33,860
Rym: No, but they seem to be not as common.

753
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:41,540
Rym: I'm reading like Wikipedia and things linked from Wikipedia, but Wikipedia says the listener can do that themselves.

754
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,012
Scott: But at the canister means you don't you only?

755
00:51:44,153 --> 00:51:50,919
Scott: you know, you only have to pick it up and get it close to the place you're going to do vacuuming and then just hold the light holes on a hose.

756
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,086
Scott: Right.

757
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:54,440
Rym: And then there's the little ones like the little handheld ones.

758
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:58,559
Rym: Like as a kid, we had the Dustbuster and they were OK.

759
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,169
Rym: Those are actually.

760
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:01,259
Rym: that's the only vacuum you need.

761
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:05,180
Scott: We didn't have the Dustbuster, but my grandmother loved the Dustbuster.

762
00:52:05,641 --> 00:52:09,723
Scott: Like she'd be you know, any time there were like crumbs from someone eating, she'd come with the Dustbuster.

763
00:52:10,225 --> 00:52:14,997
Rym: like get the Dustbuster off like the dinner table after we ate before like we washed it.

764
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,559
Rym: Dog messes, all that kind of stuff.

765
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:31,019
Rym: The only problem with those things like they're great in an apartment, especially if it's the kind of place where you're not vacuuming the floor, like you sweep the floor and you only use it for like a specific spill or like vacuuming off the couch once a month, like that kind of thing.

766
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,607
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

767
00:52:32,688 --> 00:52:35,380
Scott: it's not for a general maintenance, like I need to vacuum now.

768
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:40,000
Scott: It's like there is a. there is a single thing I must vacuum right right now.

769
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,940
Scott: It just happened something like I spilled some sugar or something.

770
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,300
Scott: Right.

771
00:52:43,602 --> 00:52:45,080
Scott: And it's like not shot back worthy.

772
00:52:46,146 --> 00:52:47,699
Scott: The little tiny one can handle it.

773
00:52:47,821 --> 00:52:48,580
Scott: You know, it's just sugar.

774
00:52:49,203 --> 00:52:49,708
Scott: And that's what.

775
00:52:49,748 --> 00:52:51,140
Scott: that's what the Dustbuster is for.

776
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,780
Rym: Then we got the Roombas like the robotic ones, topical, which.

777
00:52:56,463 --> 00:52:58,619
Scott: Yeah, I never had one, but they are.

778
00:52:59,021 --> 00:52:59,865
Scott: I have seen other.

779
00:53:00,006 --> 00:53:04,080
Scott: I've been to places people have them and I've seen them in action and they're better than you.

780
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,768
Rym: They won't do a deep clean like like.

781
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:13,780
Rym: they're quite impressive house, like pretty clean, but they won't ever get as much dirt out of the carpet as a like full on canister upright.

782
00:53:14,305 --> 00:53:15,160
Rym: But that's not their point.

783
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:23,952
Rym: Their point is, yeah, instead of like vacuuming every single day, you leave this thing going and maybe you do the real vacuuming like once every couple of months, depending on how dirty your house gets.

784
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:26,380
Scott: Yeah.

785
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,725
Scott: And it's like I guess you have to.

786
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:30,899
Scott: I presume you have to empty the room at some point.

787
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,640
Scott: It might it must tell you when it's full or something.

788
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,340
Rym: But I've never had one.

789
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:36,980
Scott: Shake it out over the trash or it has.

790
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,720
Rym: But as I think back to houses, I've never had one either.

791
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:43,760
Rym: Like the house I lived in in high school, a Roomba would have been amazing.

792
00:53:43,902 --> 00:53:44,680
Rym: Like it would have been perfect.

793
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:49,500
Rym: But like New York City apartment, that thing would not even be able to navigate this apartment.

794
00:53:51,851 --> 00:53:52,040
Scott: Yeah.

795
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:55,500
Scott: If you have too many things to close together, it's like it's really smart.

796
00:53:55,681 --> 00:54:00,560
Scott: Like mapping your floor, you know, and I guess it can get over and under like slight bumps.

797
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:02,759
Scott: But if you have like a big step, it can't climb.

798
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:03,740
Scott: Right.

799
00:54:05,081 --> 00:54:05,944
Scott: So like the house.

800
00:54:06,045 --> 00:54:13,700
Scott: I grew up in the bottom floor right at the bottom of the stairs, the staircase, there's like a little landing that was like six, you know, one step high.

801
00:54:14,281 --> 00:54:17,740
Scott: It's like so that Roomba would had to go around this whole horseshoe shape to get around.

802
00:54:18,386 --> 00:54:18,618
Scott: Right.

803
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,660
Scott: And the thing is, it's like, you know, there's so many obstacles.

804
00:54:23,122 --> 00:54:24,166
Scott: It's like, yeah, it can.

805
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:28,679
Scott: it finds the obstacles, but some of them it's like it's I know the size of a Roomba.

806
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,160
Scott: It can't physically get in between those two things.

807
00:54:31,341 --> 00:54:33,179
Scott: There isn't enough room for it to get past.

808
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:37,860
Scott: That's effectively a wall, even though you can walk through there and does.

809
00:54:38,201 --> 00:54:40,940
Scott: It's like, say, between between a coffee table and a couch.

810
00:54:41,081 --> 00:54:43,100
Scott: It's just like it can't get between those two things.

811
00:54:43,624 --> 00:54:45,179
Scott: And that place is just going to be unroomed.

812
00:54:45,644 --> 00:54:45,832
Scott: Right.

813
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,039
Scott: Never, it's never going to.

814
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,419
Rym: So if I had a big house, definitely a small place.

815
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,480
Rym: They I think they'd just be more trouble than they're worth.

816
00:54:51,863 --> 00:54:53,640
Rym: But they're not a bad technology.

817
00:54:53,740 --> 00:55:02,159
Scott: The only bad thing about them, if you got a big if you have a big, flat place with a lot of open room, it's like I would get one of those, maybe even more than one.

818
00:55:02,445 --> 00:55:02,680
Scott: Right.

819
00:55:03,522 --> 00:55:05,240
Scott: But I don't think they can go upstairs either.

820
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,399
Rym: So you might need to get a lot of people on the floor from what I can tell.

821
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:09,615
Scott: Yeah.

822
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:10,900
Scott: Yeah.

823
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,439
Scott: And then you got to keep doors open.

824
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,779
Scott: Otherwise, like even though it might get the whole floor, if you had doors, it's like, well, it can't open doors.

825
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,600
Scott: You're going to have to open them all up to the of course.

826
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:29,620
Rym: Then we got the central vacuum systems, which are interesting in that they have come in and out of fashion, at least in the US, several times.

827
00:55:29,862 --> 00:55:32,480
Rym: And like this multi-decade cycle, like they're popular.

828
00:55:32,841 --> 00:55:37,540
Rym: Then they're seen as like a bullshit nonsense that just breaks down or like a fad.

829
00:55:37,682 --> 00:55:38,839
Rym: But then they come back again.

830
00:55:39,141 --> 00:55:42,159
Rym: And right now they seem to be popular again, like they're coming back.

831
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:48,039
Scott: Yeah, my grandparents, one of the places they lived had one of those.

832
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:51,840
Scott: And it was slightly fascinating and interesting.

833
00:55:53,082 --> 00:55:56,099
Scott: You know, I don't know if they actually used it, but the house had it.

834
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,880
Scott: And one time I went in the basement and I saw there was like a central machine and I was like, Oh, that's the vacuum machine.

835
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,850
Scott: It's like this, the thing in the basement that's doing.

836
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,740
Scott: it's basically ready to vacuum.

837
00:56:06,141 --> 00:56:09,260
Scott: Whenever anyone opens one of these little flaps, they're like little flaps.

838
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:17,480
Scott: And if you opened a flap, suddenly the vacuum in the basement would detect it because you like broke the circuit or whatever, and then it would start vacuuming.

839
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,080
Scott: And there would be just a hole in the wall that has suction.

840
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,700
Scott: And you had a set of tools and you would attach the tools to the hole in the wall.

841
00:56:24,201 --> 00:56:27,400
Scott: And you could vacuum anything within range of the hole in the wall.

842
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,840
Scott: So you didn't need to drag the canister around.

843
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,500
Scott: And it was like using a canister vac only with holes everywhere.

844
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:39,300
Scott: But if you didn't have enough holes, some places might be too far from a hole to vacuum.

845
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,879
Scott: Well, it's depending on the, you know, you had to really plan it out and get those.

846
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,640
Rym: The system has to be expensive and nice enough to have enough suction to even work.

847
00:56:46,961 --> 00:56:57,800
Rym: And if it doesn't also provide either air-driven or electric power to run like the little roller brushes on the ends of the attachments, not all of them do, and the ones that don't are worthless.

848
00:57:00,301 --> 00:57:08,658
Scott: But then the other thing is you got to, you know, that thing in the basement, it's like when it fills up, you got to go in the basement and empty out the big vacuum machine into the tray, right?

849
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,120
Scott: It's like, you know, all kinds of filth is building up downstairs.

850
00:57:12,402 --> 00:57:15,680
Scott: You know, it's not like magically disappearing or anything like that.

851
00:57:15,943 --> 00:57:16,919
Rym: So I don't know.

852
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:21,240
Rym: I feel like especially in a city, like in an apartment, those things are probably silly.

853
00:57:22,862 --> 00:57:27,619
Rym: I don't know if there are any apartment buildings where they're offering like a central one for the whole building that just works.

854
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,219
Scott: Well, Roosevelt Island has one for the whole island.

855
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:34,240
Scott: To take trash is a giant pneumatic vacuum.

856
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:43,700
Rym: Istanbul has a somewhat similar system in a lot of the downtown areas where there's just like basically dumpsters that go into this big underground system that will collect garbage.

857
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:52,247
Rym: But yeah, not so in terms of there's other kinds of vacuums, but like they're not really materially different.

858
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:55,710
Scott: There are the electric stick ones, right?

859
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:06,190
Scott: Which we had, you know, like we had and we had both the regular vacuum, but also an electric stick vacuum that you would use for jobs that were like too big for a dust buster.

860
00:58:06,672 --> 00:58:09,490
Scott: But like, you know, it would be good for the hard floor only.

861
00:58:09,591 --> 00:58:11,550
Scott: Like you would really mostly be used kitchen only.

862
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:11,902
Scott: Right.

863
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:20,390
Scott: And it was like it was just an electric stick vacuum for the kitchen because it was easier to just bust it out and just start using it right away than to go get the whole ass vacuum.

864
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:24,390
Scott: And the vacuum that I have now is, you know, Dyson one, all fancy.

865
00:58:24,452 --> 00:58:24,579
Scott: Right.

866
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:30,150
Scott: But it's effectively just a modern, you know, highly advanced version of the electric stick vacuum.

867
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:33,650
Scott: It has a lithium ion battery instead of having to be plugged into the wall.

868
00:58:34,153 --> 00:58:36,350
Scott: It has a plastic canister instead of bags.

869
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:37,030
Scott: See, you just.

870
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:41,550
Rym: Alright, so it does a cyclonic separation instead of filtered separation.

871
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:43,802
Scott: Right.

872
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,670
Scott: And then it has all kinds of freaking attachments you can put on the end.

873
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:53,469
Scott: So you can actually use it on carpet, you know, as long as the battery doesn't run out and then just charge it up again.

874
00:58:53,870 --> 00:59:01,350
Scott: So it's like, you know, I sort of, you know, I think that's sort of a perfectly fine solution for a small living place, right?

875
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:08,250
Scott: You're not getting something that's too weak, not too strong, you know, it's obviously too expensive because Dyson is, you know, a rip off.

876
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:10,910
Scott: But what are the alternatives out there?

877
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,673
Scott: There weren't a lot of.

878
00:59:11,693 --> 00:59:23,410
Rym: the other big thing is how it actually filters, especially if they use filters or bags, because I remember as a kid, cheaper vacuums or the cheaper bags in the vacuums didn't actually catch all the dust.

879
00:59:23,971 --> 00:59:30,470
Rym: So you'd be picking up the debris, but you'd be spitting the dust like right back out into the room and even agitating it.

880
00:59:31,912 --> 00:59:34,329
Rym: Some percent, some percentage, but at the same time.

881
00:59:35,133 --> 00:59:40,729
Scott: Well, this is also why you should never vacuum mercury, because you're going to be just breathing that right back into your lungs.

882
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,793
Rym: But if you.

883
00:59:41,853 --> 00:59:48,750
Rym: but the problem is if you put like a full on HEPA filter on a vacuum, because we had a vacuum when I was a kid that you could put a HEPA filter in.

884
00:59:49,171 --> 00:59:55,345
Rym: That thing would fill up and be clogged so quickly that you'd be spending so much money on bags that it wasn't worth it.

885
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:57,870
Rym: And I don't know what to do about that.

886
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:59,090
Rym: Like, I don't know of any solution.

887
00:59:59,630 --> 00:59:59,778
Scott: There's.

888
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:06,429
Scott: Well, the the basement one, right, you can have a gigantic all that goes in.

889
01:00:08,411 --> 01:00:11,348
Scott: It's and it's all filtering in the basement, so you're not really breathing it in.

890
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:14,230
Scott: by the time you go to the basement, the dust is settled, right?

891
01:00:14,431 --> 01:00:15,628
Scott: Just don't kick it up too much.

892
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,008
Rym: I think we killed enough time.

893
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:21,269
Rym: I guess I could say vacuums still.

894
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:23,309
Rym: They're very loud.

895
01:00:23,492 --> 01:00:24,410
Rym: Even very nice.

896
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:33,550
Rym: Modern vacuums are just very loud, partly because there isn't really a good way to make them quiet by the physical nature of what it is they're doing.

897
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:42,350
Scott: Yeah, they are at least a steady noise that active noise canceling headphones are very good at blocking or at least reducing greatly.

898
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:47,417
Scott: But, you know, you can't put those on like your pet or your baby or and, you know, sometimes they help.

899
01:00:47,498 --> 01:00:48,430
Scott: a baby likes a vacuum.

900
01:00:49,393 --> 01:00:55,783
Rym: You know, no dog, no dog I have ever had the pleasure of living with has enjoyed when the vacuum comes out.

901
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:58,707
Scott: No, not at all.

902
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:09,110
Scott: But if someone could invent some way to to get, you know, vacuum pressure right enough to to, you know, because the other parts could just be like quiet electric motors.

903
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:09,279
Scott: Right.

904
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:10,790
Scott: It's the vacuum pump part.

905
01:01:10,912 --> 01:01:11,910
Scott: That is the loud part.

906
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:12,040
Scott: Right.

907
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,249
Scott: If someone can make a quiet one, you're rich.

908
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:14,910
Scott: Super.

909
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:15,789
Scott: You'd be rich forever.

910
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,582
Scott: So maybe worth working on.

911
01:01:18,602 --> 01:01:20,409
Scott: if you're I don't know if it's probably not possible.

912
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:20,787
Scott: Right.

913
01:01:23,118 --> 01:01:25,930
Rym: Just have some new paradigm, like instead of relying on suction.

914
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,430
Rym: What if you try to think of a Star Trek idea?

915
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:34,870
Rym: What if you use ultrasonic sound, quantum, quantum teleportation?

916
01:01:35,471 --> 01:01:46,187
Rym: You superpositioned the ultrasonic sound to agitate the dust and then way lower suction to pull it up, coupled with ionizing to like charge the particles and then have them stick to stuff inside.

917
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:49,810
Rym: You could make some sort of fancy, over expensive vacuum that no one could ever afford.

918
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:54,260
Scott: I bet I wouldn't be very good.

919
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,180
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

920
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,340
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

921
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:12,740
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

922
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,660
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

923
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:20,400
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

924

Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

925
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

926
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,340
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

927
01:02:31,701 --> 01:02:39,998
Rym: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of GeekNights are Alan Joyce, Linky G, Dread Lillie, each other by a bunch of people who really don't want me to say their names.

928
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:48,760
Rym: Chris Adon, Chris Reimer, Quinton Walton, Dex, Finn, Shai Aye, 85, Rebecca Dunn, Review Madboat, 34 Cowards, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Harl.

929
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:50,960
Rym: Stop all the downloading, Taylor Braun.

930
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:57,700
Rym: The next station is Wilson, Wilson Station and a bunch of people whose names I will not say at their specific request.

931
01:02:59,005 --> 01:03:00,120
Rym: We will do that Book Club book.

932
01:03:00,261 --> 01:03:03,920
Rym: It's a short read and I'll tell you, we'll see you listen to the singer.

933
01:03:04,661 --> 01:03:06,007
Rym: I'm thinking either two books.

934
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:11,099
Rym: I'm thinking about putting forth for the next Book Club when it's my turn again for Scott to pick one of the two.

935
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:23,239
Rym: I think I'm going to choose between Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum or some Star Trek novel written by the actor who played Garrick.

936
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,360
Rym: And Scott will get to pick which of those two he wants to read.

937
01:03:27,442 --> 01:03:33,459
Rym: I think it's a 50/50 shot which one he'll take based on the length of the former versus the subject matter of the latter.

938
01:03:33,903 --> 01:03:36,036
Rym: But for now, I simply leave you with...
