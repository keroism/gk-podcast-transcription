00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:26,789
Rym: Is that a good pooping?

4
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,539
Rym: About to do the show we literally I record the opener than Scott's like gotta poop and just gets up and walks out of the Studio, okay, like okay.

5
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:38,930
Rym: That was the exact moment you had a bowel movement.

6
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,797
Rym: Neither not too soon not too late, but right.

7
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:46,628
Rym: then the moment I said it's December 11th 2012 I'm Rym.

Scott: I just.

10
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,750
Scott: I just have some power to control exactly when this happens.

11
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:54,379
Scott: As I decide that is when the pooping move.

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,029
Rym: Ah, but if I have a bowel movement is often not that urgent.

13
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:01,923
Scott: This wasn't heard, you know incredibly urgent like I was about to put it.

14
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:02,646
Scott: poop everywhere.

15
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:08,210
Scott: that doesn't happen You know, but if I would have held that shit in I would have suffered through the the end of the show.

16
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:15,196
Rym: It should not have been good Ah, but if the bowel movement would have been suffering then perhaps you should have dealt with it at an earlier bowel movement juncture in The day.

17
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:21,781
Rym: that was the early the earliest implementer earliest manifestation of this.

18
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:25,608
Scott: then perhaps I can't hold it for an hour.

19
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:27,862
Scott: Hold you want to hold it in for an hour.

20
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:28,629
Scott: That's not good for you.

21
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:31,804
Rym: The first time I feel like hey got a poop is not the.

22
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:33,855
Rym: if I hold it in for an hour I'm not gonna feel good.

23
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:36,288
Rym: It's hey, you should poop at some time in the next 24 hours.

24
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,758
Scott: You can help move in for 24 hours.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,284
Rym: It's never that urgent.

26
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:43,030
Rym: I poop exactly what I want.

27
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:44,856
Rym: I poop on the mound.

28
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:45,338
Scott: It's not.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,686
Scott: it's not healthy to hold in poop.

30
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:48,649
Rym: I don't have to hold it in.

31
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:53,970
Rym: I have a feeling as I say Rym From this point forward whenever you're ready, you can poop.

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,250
Rym: However, if you wait more than like six or seven hours, I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna tell you it's a little urgent.

33
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:12,455
Rym: I'm going to escalate the severity from a set of three to a set of two To shape your bowels are in Some sort of.

34
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:15,770
Scott: you know Panama Canal locking system down there some shit.

35
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:20,831
Rym: I just it's never urgent unless there's a problem and I poop once a day at like 845.

36
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:25,442
Scott: it's not urgent, but you know like peeing it's like oh you feel poop in there.

37
00:02:25,502 --> 00:02:28,950
Rym: Suddenly suddenly, it's a slow rise.

38
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:31,041
Scott: No, it's pretty much as like no poop.

39
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:36,769
Scott: Hey poops in there Then you go poop it out instead of holding waiting around.

40
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:40,134
Rym: so anyway Gaming day.

41
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:40,917
Rym: See you got any news.

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,745
Scott: I do indeed have news.

43
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:43,810
Scott: This is the most amazing.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,090
Rym: No, you mean the thing you've been excited about and telling everyone about you're not as excited as Bruce is about key and peel.

45
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:52,409
Scott: Yeah, I don't think anyone give you more excited about anything.

46
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:55,887
Scott: No, but they usually.

47
00:02:55,907 --> 00:03:09,710
Scott: you know It is very hard to excite me especially in a world where I have 10 million video games 10 million animes Like it's one Right, and there's all these things that are unwatched unread unlistened unseen.

48
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:17,172
Scott: Why would I be so excited about a new thing when I've already got so many awesome things that I have not experienced already piled up?

49
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:21,328
Scott: is that thing would have to be pretty amazing to work its way so high up in the QE?

50
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:24,438
Scott: we And that thing has happened.

51
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,486
Scott: Yeah, so here's the deal.

52
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:31,485
Scott: some dude in Singapore Made a fan-made game, but he did a real damn good job.

53
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:54,498
Scott: such a good job That Capcom, you know, the the owner of the IP rights to the fan-made game he was making helped him out gave him the hooks up and they have gone so far as to specifically endorse this game and Release it for free on their website a week from yesterday Which means next Monday December 17th.

54
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,268
Scott: Wow a free PC download for everybody.

55
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:01,470
Scott: there is at Capcom unity website.

56
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:08,403
Scott: They're releasing the game known as Street Fighter cross Mega Man cross Street Fighter.

57
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:09,407
Scott: I don't know which order it goes.

58
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:12,220
Scott: It doesn't matter This game is not what you expect.

59
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:14,774
Scott: like I was you know when I first heard the title I was like.

60
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:16,146
Rym: I thought it'd be like Marvel vs.

61
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,199
Scott: Capcom Fighting game.

62
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:25,526
Scott: they just had instead of Marvel characters Just way more Mega Man characters bringing in zero bringing in Mega Man X bringing in all kinds of people.

63
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:26,529
Scott: right would man?

64
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:27,414
Scott: and you Know everything.

65
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,988
Scott: but that is not what it is.

66
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:39,688
Scott: It's actually an old-school 2d Mega Man game where instead of robot masters you have Gal Blanca Ryu Chun Li etcetera etcetera.

67
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,769
Scott: Dalzim oh my god.

68
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:49,730
Scott: You see the trailer for this shit Which is what we're gonna link you to and maybe we'll link you to the website that it will eventually be available as a download.

69
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:56,532
Scott: So I have a suspicion kills guile sonic boom when he kills ryu Hadouken.

70
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:57,616
Scott: oh my god.

71
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:59,161
Rym: Do I get the thousand hand slap?

72
00:04:59,181 --> 00:04:59,843
Rym: That's all I can.

73
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,641
Scott: I don't know which the nine guys are So I don't you know.

74
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:04,689
Scott: I don't know all the nine guys.

75
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:17,097
Rym: I know one thing I can say I will guess that this game will be not actually Nintendo hard like Mega Man 9 was Some guy Fan-made game.

76
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:21,289
Rym: I think it'll be hard, but there's a certain special level of Mega Man hard.

77
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:28,698
Scott: well I'm actually thinking about as soon as I beat some of the games on my plate going to do a Mega Man ATHON Mega Man 1 2 3 9 10 and then X 1 2 3 whatever it is.

78
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,536
Scott: I don't know how many X's there are.

79
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:33,380
Rym: I've only beaten.

80
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,676
Rym: like Mega Man 2 3 4.

81
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:37,470
Rym: I played a lot of them.

82
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,120
Scott: You gotta play Mega Man 5.

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,267
Scott: Mega Man 5 is the shit.

84
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:45,354
Rym: I Rented Mega Man 5 from blockbuster a bunch of times But I never owned it.

85
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:49,190
Scott: Mega Man 5 will play an emulator and beat Mega Man 5 because it's the proto man edition.

86
00:05:49,811 --> 00:06:00,010
Rym: No, I guess Mega Man 3 was my was my jam Partly because I liked fucking around with that hold left on controller 2 and the game fucks up code.

87
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:05,117
Scott: Okay, okay, Mega Man is the best.

88
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:07,500
Rym: You know I'm getting a vibe.

89
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,336
Rym: This is gonna be like a step above the obobo game that came out a while ago.

90
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,440
Scott: No you look at it.

91
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,807
Scott: It looks like a real Mega Man game.

92
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:14,510
Scott: watch that trailer.

93
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,354
Scott: Did you watch a trailer?

94
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:15,856
Rym: I did.

95
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,540
Rym: it looks really good.

96
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:26,917
Rym: The trailer of a Bobo's big adventure made it look equally good and the reality was it was pretty good But it was also way way easy.

97
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:32,917
Rym: Well this has Capcom Hands on it true a Bobo had no one's hands, but a Bobo's.

98
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:33,459
Scott: that's right.

99
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:36,515
Rym: I could play a Bobo again.

100
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:37,802
Scott: Me.

101
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:39,226
Rym: yeah, did you ever beat it?

102
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:39,908
Rym: No?

103
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:40,831
Rym: No really?

104
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:41,733
Rym: Why not?

105
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:42,375
Scott: Yeah?

106
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,080
Rym: What could you beat it?

107
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,026
Scott: I didn't even try.

108
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:47,100
Rym: uh-huh wait a minute.

109
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,309
Rym: It was really easy.

110
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:50,234
Rym: How come you haven't beaten.

111
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,360
Rym: It's like one playthrough.

112
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:54,180
Scott: Why haven't I played any of the other hundreds team games?

113
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,987
Rym: I haven't played because a Bobo takes less than an hour to beat Start to finish.

114
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:59,820
Scott: I got a lot of games take less than an hour to beat.

115
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,179
Rym: I don't think you can and I think you're having trouble.

116
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:04,344
Scott: Yeah, every day.

117
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:07,518
Scott: I've been going home trying to beat a Bobo for the past three years.

118
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:07,598
Scott: why?

119
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,603
Scott: So I can't.

120
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,811
Scott: I meet you Bobo.

121
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:12,099
Scott: That's what I've been doing all this time.

122
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:19,085
Rym: We've learned that if we just shorted Nintendo's stock when the Wii U was about to come out we would have made a lot of money.

123
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:29,625
Rym: Nintendo has been not doing so well stock wise and I have no intention of buying a Wii U anytime in the next six months Next six million years.

124
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:29,966
Scott: Well.

125
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,075
Rym: There is a foreseeable what chance that I would buy one.

126
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:37,011
Scott: that would be I win the lottery if One they're a dollar.

127
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:40,445
Rym: they made it also Interact with the 3ds.

128
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:43,114
Scott: yeah to the 3ds you don't have.

129
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,840
Rym: I could use four of those controllers.

130
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,042
Rym: Three.

131
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:54,060
Rym: they made a new four swords crystal chronicles pac-man verse advanced wars Any yeah, they had to make Mario Party Mario tennis.

132
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,285
Scott: They would need more than one of those because just one of those You know all of those combined.

133
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:01,220
Rym: if all of those things come then it would be worth the price.

134
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:04,857
Rym: Then I will buy a Wii U, but if I needed another reason not by a Wii U.

135
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:12,980
Scott: So luckily this only make a really big Bomberman where on your screen You see only the area around you and on the big screen you can see the whole thing.

136
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,805
Scott: But it's such a gigantic Bomberman.

137
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:16,289
Rym: Oh my god.

138
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,435
Rym: the possibilities are endless, but you know what.

139
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:25,838
Rym: they were just as endless When the GBA connected to the Gamecube they were and when the DS should have but didn't connect to the Wii.

140
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:37,498
Scott: the only thing the ideas ever connected to the Wii 4 is if you use the Nintendo store channel on Well the Nintendo channel on the Wii you could download demos of upcoming DS games to your DS over the air.

141
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:41,551
Scott: that was only DS Wii connection that they've ever done.

142
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,440
Rym: it also really took forever wasn't that good?

143
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:46,077
Rym: Didn't really work that well?

144
00:08:46,198 --> 00:09:03,118
Rym: no So if you needed another reason to really kind of not be happy with Nintendo the Wii U won't let you look at or Purchase anything in their interactive system that is rated 18 plus between the hours of 3 a.m.

145
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,979
Rym: And 11 p.m.. If you are in Europe.

146
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:15,543
Rym: Okay, really that is such an oddly specific Weird Regulation rule.

147
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:18,191
Scott: I don't understand how could none of the other consoles do this.

148
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,618
Rym: I also don't understand that now.

149
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:23,749
Rym: it is true Europe has really fucked up.

150
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,639
Rym: free speech law depends on the country as a whole.

151
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:31,543
Rym: Europe on average has much less free speech than the US Depends on the country.

152
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:40,920
Rym: on average if you average all countries that are in what we consider Europe the average the the value of free Speech if you average them all together is lower than free speech in the US.

153
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:52,285
Rym: I guess so also a lot of the individual countries like France has weird laws about What you can show on different kinds of TV at different times at the same time that you can see boobies on TV In certain times.

154
00:09:52,406 --> 00:10:02,459
Rym: yeah, so in some ways is less than in some ways more Except at the same time a lot of the regulations in the US really only actually apply to broadcast TV Which effectively doesn't matter anymore?

155
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,380
Rym: But and radio simultaneously and radio, but yet in podcast I can say fuck all I want like fuck fuck.

156
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,209
Rym: And I'm showing movies right now.

157
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:12,360
Scott: It's up boobies on the podcast.

158
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:15,057
Rym: In fact I'm playing the Dave Zader game.

159
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:22,650
Scott: Apparently this podcast even has scared What I was about to say.

160
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:26,646
Rym: when did Dave Zader ever, and then I'd yeah You did.

161
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,219
Scott: you were the one who brought scat on to this.

162
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:34,000
Rym: Well, I believe that you you were the the inseptor of that, and I simply brought it out.

163
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:35,455
Scott: I didn't bring it out onto the show.

164
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:36,920
Rym: well Yeah, hope you brought it out.

165
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,110
Rym: Otherwise you failed in your end and not onto the show.

166
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:52,698
Rym: you want to put it on the show here, but in particular For example Germany has a lot of restrictive free speech laws and there appear to be a number of laws and rules in the EU Which remember as of you know a while ago the European Union.

167
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,019
Rym: there are?

168
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,933
Rym: European laws now yep, and there appear to be a lot of your.

169
00:10:58,013 --> 00:10:59,639
Scott: I don't know how much they're enforced like.

170
00:10:59,659 --> 00:10:59,859
Scott: I don't.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,080
Scott: I don't really get it.

172
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,756
Scott: I haven't looked it up.

173
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,738
Scott: They it seems like a lot of them are regulations on companies like this as opposed to laws that police would enforce.

174
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:13,079
Rym: so This is ridiculous and one this is one of the reasons why?

175
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:28,069
Rym: While I'm generally a very sort of left-wing slash radical techno progressivist type of person when it comes to politics I really don't want the UN the EU or basically anyone, but the United States to maintain the Basically complete control of the Internet.

176
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:38,099
Rym: because for all the things we've fucked up as a country The Internet is the one thing we have fucked up the least And relative to everyone else we're doing a pretty good job

177
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:38,829
Scott: Mm-hmm,

178
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:46,880
Rym: but - It bothers me that there's this movement in a like Australia and Europe and there is a movement for this in the u.s.

179
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,380
Rym: To put restrictions on things to protect children that also affect adults.

180
00:11:53,463 --> 00:12:06,088
Rym: I am fine with having any like computers like having operating system things where a User could lock things down for like a parent could lock things down for their children if they wish But the moment

181
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:06,813
Scott: me

182
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:12,174
Rym: as an adult Has no ability to interact with that system and/or disable it.

183
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:13,297
Rym: that is bullshit.

184
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:15,563
Rym: There is zero Rationale.

185
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:18,092
Scott: yeah, it all should not be enabled by default.

186
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:24,191
Scott: No, it's you something you have to turn on Right because it's like kids can't really buy things.

187
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:29,640
Scott: So you don't have to worry about a kid buying a Wii and going he Because a kid can't buy things.

188
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,703
Scott: Yeah, so why?

189
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:35,960
Scott: so it should be disabled by the fault and then the adult who purchased it would enable it.

190
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:42,720
Rym: The kid immediately hacks it, but then the kid deserves it anyway, so fine, but the what this is so anachronistic.

191
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:45,300
Rym: Did they really think whoever made this happen?

192
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,035
Rym: Do you really think that if you can't buy these games between 11 p.m.

193
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:49,457
Rym: And 3 a.m.

194
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,820
Rym: That one kids aren't gonna buy them and the two no one's gonna have a problem with this that kids are asleep at those hours.

195
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:01,645
Scott: Thing is well, I mean first of all, right It's like you've got.

196
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:16,060
Scott: you know, if you look think of all the different categories of responsible parents responsible children Good bad everywhere in between on the gray scale, right kids who are more Responsible who are staying up late because their parents trust them and they're good kids.

197
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:23,180
Rym: I'd sit down till till the Sun came up playing like sieve or right one or do not, you know They're gonna have access to these games.

198
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,345
Scott: But it won't really matter.

199
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:25,589
Scott: because just fine if they do.

200
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:31,375
Scott: kids who are sort of in the middle Right, you know their parents make them go to bed.

201
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:32,360
Scott: Maybe they're irresponsible.

202
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:32,681
Scott: Yeah, the

203
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:48,920
Rym: hardware controls don't matter because the good parent with the troublesome kid or the kid who can't you know Shouldn't the kid who's 15, but you know, some people just can't deal with games like this when they're 15 a good parent The kid will listen to him and won't do what they're not supposed to do or they'll get caught if they try to do it.

204
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:52,340
Scott: Right, and then you have just the irresponsible parents.

205
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,960
Scott: It's like well those kids are gonna be up all night because the parents are responsible.

206
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:56,984
Scott: So it doesn't matter.

207
00:13:57,104 --> 00:14:01,400
Rym: but this is more of a Thursday thing, but in the meta in the general, I do not like it.

208
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:09,810
Rym: I'm fine with regulations laws everything to help protect kids and to help parents and all those things depends on the specific Yeah, but the philosophically I have no problem.

209
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,260
Scott: We don't like the safe playground actually not at all.

210
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,596
Scott: But philosophically and playground should not be a bed of spikes and fire.

211
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:16,480
Scott: All that would be pretty cool.

212
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:20,840
Rym: I have no problem with the idea of something like this being debated.

213
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:26,919
Rym: My problem is when I as an adult I have to deal with this stuff when I don't have.

214
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,998
Scott: you know We don't live in Europe.

215
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:39,116
Rym: Nah But if I live in Europe or if I don't if I go to Europe on a business trip and I have a Wii U I want to buy Assassin's Creed at 1105 p.m I can't and that's bullshit.

216
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:39,597
Scott: You mean 1105 a.m.

217
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,507
Rym: No, 11 p.m.

218
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:43,170
Rym: To 3 a.m.

219
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,060
Rym: Is the only time you can do this.

220
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,223
Scott: Yeah, you said if you want to buy it at 11 p.m.

221
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:47,744
Scott: And you can.

222
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:48,285
Rym: I said 1105 p.m I can't.

223
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:52,692
Scott: oh What.

224
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:54,399
Scott: oh, it's wait a minute.

225
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,323
Scott: No, 1105 p.m.

226
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:56,568
Scott: Will be late at night when you could.

227
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:57,651
Rym: Oh, yeah I guess I could.

228
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,837
Scott: you're backwards see like see what happens.

229
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,005
Rym: You have confusing bullshit arbitrary regulations.

230
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,138
Scott: I Was right the whole time but also Nintendo.

231
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:07,680
Rym: how come?

232
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,864
Rym: no one else does this stuff.

233
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:12,557
Scott: Nintendo always does Extra shit for some stupid reason.

234
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:17,732
Rym: I mean steam doesn't prevent me from buying a game at 11.

235
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:23,410
Scott: This is why most of the world is PC gaming except for the US Yeah, where people are too dumb to plug a PC into the TV.

236
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,917
Rym: I just thought this was kind of amazing.

237
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:34,360
Rym: So I wanted to shed light on this sort of ridiculous star but anyway things of the day.

238
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:41,870
Rym: so we were at an epic party at our friend's house over the weekend near Philly and Well, the YouTube party happened for a while downstairs.

239
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:44,360
Scott: I was not invited to that YouTube party.

240
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:45,540
Rym: No, you're busy doing other stuff.

241
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:51,800
Rym: We also had the look at old pictures of Rym and Scott and the front row crew from like a decade ago.

242
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,840
Rym: I was at that party and we had the let's play Zendo with strangers party, which was actually really good.

243
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:06,755
Rym: I can't believe that one of our friends used the Zendo rule of Something involving prime numbers of pants the one you're not supposed to use.

244
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:07,900
Rym: and yet they got it.

245
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,192
Rym: But I think they only got it because I always use that as the example of a bullshit rule You shouldn't use.

246
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:17,280
Rym: yeah But at the same time we also have a lot of friends who are getting really good at Zendo and start upping the ante.

247
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,936
Rym: so We watched this series of short animated videos little shorts about Starcraft.

248
00:16:25,638 --> 00:16:28,119
Rym: It is called Starcrafts.

249
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,242
Rym: It's just adorable.

250
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:38,689
Rym: It's little zerglings and protoss dudes running around with sound effects from the game being cute and They're super short and you should just watch all of these.

251
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,840
Rym: They're by car bot animations and they're ridiculously adorable.

252
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,538
Scott: This is funnier to me because I have recently actually beaten the Starcraft 2 campaign.

253
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:52,538
Rym: I'm thinking about starting to play the Starcraft 2 campaign in the next six months and getting it into the queue.

254
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:56,347
Rym: Mm-hmm All right, you got a thing of the day.

255
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:56,809
Scott: I do.

256
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:00,307
Scott: yeah, so, you know the board game lahav Which you've only played a couple times.

257
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:01,253
Rym: Yeah, cuz it's okay.

258
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:01,715
Rym: Not great.

259
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:03,943
Scott: It's good game These people.

260
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,167
Scott: they're big board game nerds.

261
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:07,016
Scott: They went to lahav.

262
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:17,040
Scott: I would like to go there And what they did is they took the cards from the game And they went to all the places that are on the cards and took a picture with the card at the place.

263
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:23,960
Scott: And here's a little imgur photo gallery of them holding up the cards from the places in front of the places.

264
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:25,064
Rym: That's adorable.

265
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:25,987
Scott: That is pretty good.

266
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:29,760
Scott: I'm wondering I'm trying to think of like what else can we do this with Puerto Rico?

267
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:35,233
Scott: What Puerto Rico doesn't have a deck of cards really with pictures as the buildings.

268
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,480
Rym: you go find buildings that do those things than plantations.

269
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:40,394
Scott: I don't think you're gonna find all those plantations.

270
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:41,640
Scott: You find an indigo plantation.

271
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,046
Rym: There's probably still.

272
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:50,616
Scott: I'll bet there is still indigo planting in Puerto Rico You gotta find an indigo factory a large indigo plant and a small indigo play.

273
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,183
Scott: you're gonna find both of them All right, fine.

274
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:52,886
Rym: Let's do Eclipse.

275
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:53,930
Scott: You gotta find a sugar mill.

276
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,633
Rym: How about Eclipse?

277
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:55,557
Scott: I'm up for that.

278
00:17:55,597 --> 00:18:00,126
Rym: if you can make it We could do it with El Grande.

279
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:04,640
Rym: go to all those regions of Spain, yeah, but those aren't on individual cards.

280
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:08,879
Rym: Yeah, you just go and take a picture of a Caballero in front of a Castile in each place.

281
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:18,580
Scott: We're better off doing it with the D&D monster manual and Doing it with all the not all the monsters that actually exist.

282
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:19,545
Rym: No, no, no.

283
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:27,780
Scott: like rats like fantasy movies and TV shows we find one instance of everything in Fantasy movies and TV shows and put and make basically take the monster man.

284
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,212
Scott: It will replace the art with a picture from the movie or TV show.

285
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:39,592
Scott: We might be able to pull it off with Genoa You know, it doesn't also have cards with places or anything our grid.

286
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:41,639
Rym: just go find power plants of each type.

287
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,315
Scott: Anyway, well, you're stretching it here in the meta moment.

288
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:51,797
Rym: Holy shit We launched an entirely new show called GeekNights presents did we?

289
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:52,921
Scott: Yes Why?

290
00:18:53,563 --> 00:19:01,090
Rym: because we're stupid and we committed to like 40 plus episodes of this bullshit and so far each one is taking us like It's like a half hour long.

291
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:09,138
Rym: So too long And they're only gonna get longer because I was thinking about why don't you edit him down genius that is edited down.

292
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:16,980
Scott: No So what we're doing Is a new show because we pretty much repeat the same thing over and over again so you can edit down.

293
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:24,291
Rym: So we only say it once a YouTube show where we we take a media and we present it to you in a sort of Final thoughts format.

294
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:25,340
Rym: So for example, we're starting.

295
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:30,020
Rym: You know, we did radio free equestria is kind of like a test to get good at this kind of stuff.

296
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,727
Rym: We're gonna keep doing radio free equestria.

297
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:32,209
Rym: Don't worry.

298
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:42,073
Scott: I got a huge backlog of episodes I just have to upload and luckily the new episode which we have not our feed yet had A lot of material when it should have had none.

299
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:47,719
Rym: I know apparently The pony named Luna spies on kids dreams in their sleep.

300
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,347
Scott: That gives us something to talk about

301
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:50,271
Rym: kind of creepy

302
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:51,718
Scott: as being scared in the woods gives

303
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:51,838
Rym: us

304
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:59,073
Scott: Although we could talk about the haunted the haunted stories Like what's up with the headless horse and the rusty horseshoe

305
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:06,096
Rym: also the fact that there's rainbow Waterfalls, so I guess they could harvest rainbows in the old days and later they made machines to make it.

306
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:07,420
Rym: That's natural rainbow.

307
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,889
Rym: They'd be like hydroelectric rainbow.

308
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:09,613
Rym: I don't know.

309
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:21,056
Rym: Yeah So we're taking that and doing the same thing to an anime called shoujo kakamei, otena because it's Incredibly complex full of allegory lots to analyze little a lot of shit.

310
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:22,100
Scott: That's just fault, you know.

311
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,449
Scott: Red herring.

312
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,748
Rym: Yeah red herrings But also little bits like there's things.

313
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:33,166
Rym: dudes say in episode one that an episode 38 you go Oh fuck, but you don't remember.

314
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:37,180
Scott: but then if you watch episode one immediately after watching the final episode you go.

315
00:20:39,341 --> 00:21:00,820
Rym: So if and when we finish this or if we get it on long enough to where we can support doing multiple shows GeekNights Presents is going to be a show where we take things and we don't just review them You know, we don't just preview them we don't just talk about our experiences with them we finish them Mmm, because really we only have done this for anime up to this point.

316
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:11,095
Rym: So we're trying to do and I guess our book clubs are trying to do this for other kinds of things In other meta news Magfest, oh, it's real close now fast.

317
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:13,146
Scott: I bought bolt bust I also.

Scott: it is on so hard.

Rym: I've got the second seat reserved on our bus to magfest.

321
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:21,079
Scott: I got the first seat.

Rym: It's coming.

00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:41,020
Rym: I think we're doing what we're doing a pay lecture beyond Candyland rewritten revised Scott.

329
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,106
Rym: We got a rewrite and revise that.

00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:44,640
Rym: we are going to be on two panel discussion.

00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:27,767
Scott: They had to be anime.

00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:31,403
Scott: Yeah, ConnectiCon they have to be Con.

00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:35,250
Rym: panel submissions will be opening as soon as the people I have no control over.

350
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:41,764
Rym: Oh turn it on and No, but here's the deal.

351
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:42,647
Rym: ConnectiCon.

352
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:47,580
Rym: panel submissions are gonna open soonish and we're gonna start scheduling shit in January.

353
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,239
Rym: so Don't wait like you did in the past.

354
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:57,160
Rym: Okay, if you submit like April, we're probably already filled in all the good slots with good panels.

355
00:22:57,561 --> 00:22:59,208
Rym: We're really stepping up the game.

356
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:03,169
Rym: if you thought we stepped up the game and ConnectiCon last year We're gonna step up.

357
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:04,540
Rym: this is so far for now.

358
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,192
Scott: Let's heat them at a moment to things happening soon like magfa.

359
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:09,883
Rym: All right, the book club book is the great Gatsby It is.

360
00:23:09,943 --> 00:23:11,467
Rym: Scott has irregular bowel movements.

361
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:14,414
Rym: I don't did you poop at this time yesterday.

362
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,403
Scott: I Don't remember then?

363
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:19,269
Rym: you do not have regular bowel movements.

364
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,066
Rym: You've never had to poop during a GeekNights recording before You got home early.

365
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:24,529
Scott: I don't know.

366
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:27,861
Rym: I did this only 645.

367
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:31,439
Scott: It's supposed to happen at the exact same time every day within a span of an hour or two.

368
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:35,900
Rym: Do you always poop right after GeekNights or right before it in my bathroom?

369
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,808
Rym: Maybe that's why I always run out of toilet paper.

370
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,320
Rym: You're using it all up every day before the show.

371
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:40,923
Rym: It's cuz.

372
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:42,733
Scott: you use half a roll every time you poop.

373
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:45,141
Rym: I have a clean sphincter.

374
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:47,292
Scott: your I also have a clean sphincter.

375
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:48,478
Rym: apparently not if you don't use.

376
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:57,990
Scott: well apparently you're using all my toilet paper and blaming it on me and I think there is clean and your roll was almost empty and It is still not a hundred percent empty and my sphincter is clean.

377
00:23:58,492 --> 00:24:01,364
Rym: That roll was almost full before it was almost into it Uh-huh.

378
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:07,229
Scott: So do I need to take a picture of the roll?

379
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:09,640
Scott: every time I poop before and after it's gotten I have a problem.

380
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,412
Rym: That'd be a good tumblr.

381
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:13,004
Rym: Really big problem.

382
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:15,491
Scott: Also, you should check us out and all the places on the internet.

383
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:20,496
Scott: Oh, yeah, g-plus Twitter Google communities But you think Facebook page.

384
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:30,067
Scott: currently I think the thing that automatically posts our stuff to the Facebook page is broken and doesn't matter because Facebook doesn't reliably send your Friends anyway, yeah, but we're gonna.

385
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:31,010
Scott: I'm gonna fix it.

386
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,777
Scott: Anyway, but when I get a chance, don't forget your.

387
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:38,589
Rym: it's likely You're not getting all of our stuff If you only follow us on Facebook.

388
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:41,160
Scott: 100% likely because it's not automatically posting there right now.

389
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:48,772
Rym: But even once we get it posting there again, you're still not gonna get everything Maybe due to the way Facebook works with organizations like us.

390
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:50,978
Scott: It's possible and their attempts at monetization.

391
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:54,630
Rym: Yeah So problem Scott and I have.

392
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,149
Rym: we've had this problem for Ever 11 years.

393
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:00,267
Scott: Our whole lives give or take.

394
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:11,939
Rym: now because there was a there was a time at RIT When we really only played board games Inside of our own group and other than if we played a choir with Scott Johnson, there was never a problem.

395
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:16,860
Rym: But then we brought in our horizons and decided we would bring our board gaming goodness to the world.

396
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:34,086
Rym: We started playing board games with people we weren't already friends and family with and I learned something At a parapetia a horrible realization when I sat down to play Settlers of Catan and what should have taken 45 minutes took three hours Mm-hmm.

397
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:50,634
Rym: It was in I think 2003 and I was playing Settlers of Catan at our wag with three people who I didn't know super well and had not played board Games with before and I realized at that moment Pretty much everyone else in the fucking world except me and Scott just never takes their turn.

398
00:25:50,835 --> 00:25:52,300
Scott: Yeah, there are exceptions.

399
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:58,612
Rym: Those exceptions are mostly our own friends So all you FRC types and family that we play with.

400
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:00,298
Rym: we're not talking about most of you.

401
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:12,510
Scott: Yeah well, there's a lot of reasons for Taking a turn slowly, but there's only one way to take a turn quickly be smart Yep, so you might remember a long time ago.

402
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,408
Rym: We had a series on GeekNights called how to not suck Man, where did that happen to that?

403
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,594
Rym: So we're bringing it back.

404
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:19,539
Rym: We're not gonna complain.

405
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:24,315
Scott: We're gonna complain about all the slow people constantly and say how stupid they are.

406
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:38,154
Rym: in this episode we're basically going to tell you if you are or think you are one of those people who plays a board game and You're taking too long on your turn and other people are getting annoyed at you or odds are.

407
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:44,999
Rym: or you play games with other people Who are doing this and it's frustrating you and you want to learn how to deal with them or?

408
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:50,765
Rym: You want to get into the air hockey situation The air hockey conundrum.

409
00:26:51,227 --> 00:27:02,397
Rym: if you follow all of it by all of our advice and you're not having a problem Suddenly you'll start taking your turn in a tenth the time you normally spend and now you're gonna hate all the rest of your friends But you'll win a lot more games.

410
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:07,979
Rym: So how to not suck at taking your motherfucking turn.

411
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:10,507
Rym: We're just talking about board games.

412
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:15,240
Rym: Oh these concepts can apply generally to other types of games.

413
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,746
Scott: Alright, so the first thing you got to do right which is true in general for not sucking a board games Turn the page and then you wash your hands.

414
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:23,171
Scott: Is know the fucking rules.

415
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:27,407
Scott: a lot of people take so long in their turn because they're Not sure what the fuck they're supposed to be doing.

416
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:30,960
Rym: now you know, let's assume you're you're learning the game.

417
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,905
Rym: You don't know the rules.

418
00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:33,091
Rym: that well, that's fine.

419
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:34,940
Rym: You can still take your turn quickly.

420
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:38,859
Rym: The way to do that is if you're confused about a rule on your turn.

421
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:42,896
Rym: What normal people do most people I've seen is they sit there going.

422
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:47,559
Scott: hmm Like they're thinking like or ask to see the rules and start reading them.

423
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:49,975
Rym: Yep So they'll be like, hey, can I see the rules for a second?

424
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:50,680
Rym: They just sit there going.

425
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,668
Scott: Why'd you just fucking ask?

426
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:54,078
Rym: or they don't even ask for the rules.

427
00:27:54,098 --> 00:28:02,597
Rym: They go and then after five minutes of They look up and say hey Rym What are victory points again?

428
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,199
Rym: That's why I flipped the fucking table over and go home.

429
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,158
Rym: Yeah to ask immediately and if you have to ask the same question every round.

430
00:28:11,178 --> 00:28:14,220
Rym: you Probably shouldn't be playing this game.

431
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:19,772
Rym: You need to go home and read the rules because you obviously didn't pay attention When it was taught to you nor when everyone answered your questions.

432
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,242
Scott: and maybe you should go home and play Candyland and work your way Up to whatever you.

433
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,687
Rym: but the moral here.

434
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:36,820
Rym: if you are confused about a point in the rules during the game ask Immediately and if asking the question is going to compromise your position in the game That's your penalty for not knowing the rules.

435
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:37,663
Rym: You will.

436
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:41,735
Rym: you will have a more fruitful experience by learning the rules by asking the question.

437
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:46,535
Rym: if you're really worried about it Pick someone else at the table and say hey, can I ask you a question?

438
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:47,460
Rym: show them the card?

439
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,283
Rym: You don't understand.

440
00:28:48,303 --> 00:28:52,019
Scott: maybe find someone who's not actually playing the game but knows the rules and ask them.

441
00:28:52,581 --> 00:29:02,180
Scott: But if it's like a card in your hand you want to ask about maybe there's someone around who knows how the game works And you can just show them your card and you won't have to show anyone else at the table who's actually playing your card.

442
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:11,292
Scott: All right The second thing you got to do is the most important while you're playing the game Pay fucking attention to the game the whole time you're playing the game.

443
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:13,780
Scott: now a lot of people that sit down to play a game.

444
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,363
Scott: Well, what do they do?

445
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:15,408
Scott: They getting up?

446
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:20,525
Scott: They're looking around walking around peeing Drinking talking about something.

447
00:29:20,546 --> 00:29:23,699
Scott: That's not the game not seeing what other people doing during the turns.

448
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:29,080
Scott: now There are some games where you don't have to pay attention during other people's turns say Alhambra, right?

449
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:32,495
Scott: It doesn't matter what the fuck other people do on their turns.

450
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:45,868
Rym: when it comes to your turn well, there is a fifth or sixth order of strategy and Process you can do to be to have a slight advantage in Alhambra by counting the cards people take up But you really don't need to do that.

451
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:48,200
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing to do during other people's turns.

452
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,554
Scott: So you can just wait till your turn then decide very quickly because there isn't much to decide.

453
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:58,828
Scott: but in most games You should pay attention What's happening during other people's turns like in Puerto Rico.

454
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:11,547
Rym: now many who play games or teeny especially might already be saying but Rym You get up all the time and dick around with people and yet because I already know what I'm gonna do in my turn I the master Attention, I will not.

455
00:30:11,587 --> 00:30:14,080
Scott: yeah, it's it's do as I say don't do as I do right?

456
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,980
Scott: I will not get up or take my attention off of a game Except in the case where I already know what I'm going to do on my turn.

457
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:26,969
Scott: You know and my turn is going to take a very small amount of time But it is not yet my turn.

458
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:35,474
Scott: unless I am in that situation Where my next turn was already planned and will be swift I am paying attention to the game and calculating the next turn.

459
00:30:35,815 --> 00:30:48,880
Scott: as soon as my turn ends I immediately begin calculating the next turn and this is point number three right parallel processing While other people are playing you don't get up and leave like at Alhambra.

460
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:53,960
Scott: You pay the fuck attention and you think about what you're gonna do on your turn.

461
00:30:54,502 --> 00:31:03,180
Scott: During other people's turns you don't stop playing the game at any moment Right unless you can make no more meaningful decisions.

462
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:19,977
Scott: Or you are waiting for new information to be able to figure out what to do when you're doing your turn in which case Sit there and wait for that new information to appear Which is why we get very frustrated when your turn takes so long because you're waiting for you to reveal the information We need to complete our calculations.

463
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:23,437
Rym: now We talk about processing in parallel.

464
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:24,719
Rym: well Let's say you do that.

465
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,574
Rym: But even then there are some games where you can iterate and step through like acquire.

466
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:36,040
Rym: as a game you can basically Calculate the perfect move, but it takes a while unless you reasonably go to math and pattern recognition.

467
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:44,149
Rym: But you need to as a player, and this is where these get more complicated Recognize very simply don't worry about all this other stuff.

468
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:49,923
Rym: recognize when a decision you are about to make is Arbitrary now.

469
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:53,673
Rym: This is already this everything the high level technique.

470
00:31:53,873 --> 00:32:03,515
Rym: the next several steps that we're gonna talk about are Things you can do that are all under the sort of meta category of be better at games.

471
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:11,260
Rym: if you are better at games Generally you don't have to write a specific game just better at games and generally learn master basic skills.

472
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:12,940
Rym: Then you can do all these things.

473
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:23,083
Scott: Yeah, it's like there's some things you can do to speed up your turn that you don't need to be good at games to Do like the things we've already mentioned paying attention and things like that and if you don't do those things then there's a fucking Problem.

474
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:24,530
Scott: there's another set of things.

475
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,640
Scott: we need to have a low level of game skills.

476
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:28,858
Scott: You need to have some amount of skills to do them.

477
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:33,200
Scott: So and it's not necessarily a big fucking problem if you don't do those it's just slightly annoying.

478
00:32:33,562 --> 00:32:36,740
Scott: Then there are things where you can take your turn crazy fast if you're a master.

479
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:41,057
Scott: No one's expecting that from you if you're not a master, but you should still strive for it.

480
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:42,863
Scott: otherwise Why are you here?

481
00:32:43,164 --> 00:32:48,560
Rym: Yeah, like in teeny I'll just be like bam bam bam bam bam, but I've played teeny like a hundred times.

482
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:52,814
Scott: It's also okay If a few turns during the game are slow and the rest are fast.

483
00:32:52,934 --> 00:33:09,394
Scott: when I play a game like teeny Most of my turns will be relatively quick, but maybe two or three times during the game There will be a tough situation where even when after it gets around to my turn Oh, I don't know what to do or something particularly devastating happens right before my turn and then I go off fuck And then I need to really figure it out or

484
00:33:09,576 --> 00:33:12,052
Rym: so This is a kind of an aside.

485
00:33:12,112 --> 00:33:28,152
Rym: if you want to get better at games Watch people who are good at a game play and pay attention to when they take a long time on their turn and when they don't because if we're playing if I'm playing a game that I know and I I'm taking my turns like that and suddenly I take a long time on my turn.

486
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:43,820
Rym: if you can figure out why suddenly, I'm you know thinking really hard you're gonna start to figure out the game because aspect for Recognize arbitrary decisions is such low-hanging fruit that so many people I play games with just can't grasp.

487
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:48,158
Rym: There are many decisions in games that are effectively arbitrary.

488
00:33:48,559 --> 00:34:02,640
Rym: either It doesn't matter what choice you make because it actually doesn't matter or it doesn't matter because you Lack the ability to calculate how much it matters to a degree that will actually affect the game.

489
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:10,666
Scott: For example, who's gonna if you sit there and you're playing rock-paper-scissors and you sit there thinking he's chose rock last time He's not gonna choose rock again.

490
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:10,967
Scott: Is he?

491
00:34:11,027 --> 00:34:11,953
Scott: or maybe he will.

492
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:13,098
Scott: Oh, maybe he won't.

493
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,273
Scott: Inconceivable, right?

494
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:17,384
Scott: then You are stupid.

495
00:34:17,404 --> 00:34:19,870
Scott: You should know that it's arbitrary.

496
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,612
Scott: which one you pick?

497
00:34:20,831 --> 00:34:23,980
Scott: just fucking pick one randomly as randomly as possible.

498
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:24,722
Scott: Yeah, right.

499
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:32,905
Scott: Do not use any psychology or any chain of logic, you know, if you can use all three at once That way you can't lose.

500
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:34,188
Scott: you win two out of three times.

501
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:43,951
Rym: now the same time there might be two options where you know Option a one and a half time trade a good To get money and option B is trade a good to get victory points.

502
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:45,777
Rym: and maybe you're not like.

503
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:46,620
Rym: you don't know.

504
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:57,520
Rym: so you could try to figure it out, but if you have no direction to go on and You're trying to calculate it, but you don't understand what you're calculating.

505
00:34:57,983 --> 00:35:03,832
Rym: You'll think that you're working hard to win the game But really your brain just going in circles and you're not like.

506
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,640
Rym: you're adding numbers up and you're not going anywhere.

507
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:11,932
Rym: There are also some decisions so the decision is effectively arbitrary because while it could be calculated you like the capacity.

508
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:20,872
Rym: as soon as you recognize that you will not be Able to come to the mathematical conclusion You're trying to get to in your brain in a reasonable span of time.

509
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,298
Rym: You need to cut your losses.

510
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,204
Rym: pretend It's an arbitrary decision.

511
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:29,760
Rym: instead let the game go on and instead do a post hoc process of at the end of the game.

512
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:31,608
Rym: Think back that time.

513
00:35:31,648 --> 00:35:34,380
Rym: I couldn't figure it out now that I've seen the end of the game.

514
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,180
Scott: What should I have done for example in a game of Puerto Rico, right?

515
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,613
Scott: There are certain things where I don't decide.

516
00:35:39,634 --> 00:35:40,640
Scott: I just go with it.

517
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:46,982
Scott: For example, let's say it's the first time the captain comes out and all the boats are empty and I pick the captain and I got Three corn.

518
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:49,512
Scott: do I go in the small boat the medium boat of the big boat?

519
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:50,937
Rym: now there you could I.

520
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:51,720
Scott: there's easy.

521
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:54,871
Scott: It's possible to look at everyone's barrels and fucking figure it out.

522
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:55,453
Scott: You know what I do.

523
00:35:55,473 --> 00:35:57,340
Scott: I just fucking pick a boat.

524
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:58,226
Scott: I don't give a shit.

525
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:59,676
Scott: that matters so little.

526
00:35:59,696 --> 00:36:08,509
Scott: ah now Here's the thing that claim might end up mattering but to time it would take to figure it out Versus how much it would benefit me in the game.

527
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:11,517
Scott: I don't bother even though it's I really want to win.

528
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:12,620
Scott: It's a skill based game.

529
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:13,518
Scott: I'm very good at it.

530
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:17,452
Scott: I don't bother thinking about that when I just put my stuff on whatever boat I feel like

531
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:30,732
Rym: now while the iterative Calculation of that is basically impossible or useless because either you're gonna be in a tournament where there's gonna be some sort of time limit I mean or you're playing with friends where there's the punching time limit.

532
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,458
Scott: I mean there could be something obvious.

533
00:36:32,498 --> 00:36:36,140
Scott: for example Let's say I have four corn and the person next to me has four corn.

534
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:40,112
Scott: I'm gonna put my four corn on the sixth size boat to prevent them from.

535
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:43,082
Scott: but that's so easy to see I can see that Immediately.

536
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:48,160
Scott: So what I do is I look around really quickly and it takes me about three seconds to figure that one out.

537
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,631
Scott: And if I don't see any of those types of situations, then I just pick.

538
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:52,895
Scott: any fucking boat does not know.

539
00:36:52,915 --> 00:36:54,220
Rym: this leads into item six.

540
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:56,211
Rym: I mean, I'm gonna take a term.

541
00:36:56,231 --> 00:37:01,014
Rym: I we had other terms for this But I'm committed to using the terms in that Garfield book from now on.

542
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:04,887
Rym: Okay, the characters of games Develop directional heuristics.

543
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,880
Rym: what that means is look at Scott's situation.

544
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:09,706
Rym: So which boat do I put it on?

545
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:18,580
Rym: the decision is effectively arbitrary because I lack the ability to compute Reasonably all the possible outcomes into the future with odds that will actually have a chance.

546
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:27,932
Scott: Yeah I have no idea what barrels if I bother to think about what barrels people could possibly have for the next captain Let alone two or three captains down the road.

547
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:28,917
Scott: Fuck that.

548
00:37:28,937 --> 00:37:39,000
Rym: So I play the game a lot and Like I said before if there's a decision that appears are that appears like it is not actually arbitrary.

549
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:43,080
Rym: But you it is effectively arbitrary for you because you can't figure it out.

550
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:50,719
Rym: You have to put like a mental bookmark next to that and every time you have to think back every round Until it becomes apparent what you should have done.

551
00:37:51,500 --> 00:38:04,060
Rym: Eventually, you'll have this sort of soft skill this directional heuristic Directional meaning you can have recognized a pattern where oh if the board looks like this I should move in this direction.

552
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:08,634
Scott: Yeah a directional heuristic is basically the method you use to decide what to do on.

553
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:12,049
Scott: your term for is a perfect example of one of My favorite directional heuristics.

554
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:18,720
Scott: right the way I play power grid How much do I bid on a power plant that I want in power grid?

555
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,142
Scott: And this is very simple calculation I make.

556
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:29,092
Scott: what I do is I look at how much the resources I'm going to have to pay To get the resources I want from the market that turn.

557
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,380
Scott: I estimate that and I take that money and set it aside.

558
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:38,044
Scott: No, then I look at how many houses I want to buy that turn based on the total amount of power I'll be able to make.

559
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:41,780
Scott: how how many will I get be able to get houses up to that number?

560
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,740
Scott: How much will it cost me right this round?

561
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:57,424
Scott: I estimate and I remove that amount of money from my hand and then I look at how much money is left and that's the Maximum amount of money that I will spend on buying a power plant this turn and that is my directional heuristic the method I use to make a decision.

562
00:38:57,464 --> 00:39:01,278
Scott: the decision I need to make is how much do I am I willing to bid on the power plant?

563
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:08,439
Scott: and There's a method to making that decision subtract the resource money subtract the house money count the leftover money All right.

564
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:12,820
Scott: So these are directional heuristics and you had to develop these in particular games.

565
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,726
Scott: You look at the decisions you have to make in a particular game and then figure out what will be the method I use to Make that decision.

566
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:25,400
Scott: and then once you have that method Every time it gets to your turn anytime you had to make that decision.

567
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:26,626
Scott: Use the method.

568
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:29,400
Scott: use it as soon as you have enough information to use it.

569
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:30,425
Scott: Figure.

570
00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:31,430
Scott: then you have your decision.

571
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:33,200
Rym: some of these are calculated.

572
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:38,240
Rym: Yeah, some some of them are crutches in calculation like if anything were really good.

573
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:45,160
Rym: So in Tigris and Euphrates, I have a really simple heuristic of when I will attack someone else.

574
00:39:45,504 --> 00:39:46,700
Rym: I have all these other conditionals.

575
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,654
Scott: I can't really get into what I have a plus three advantage or more if I will.

576
00:39:50,814 --> 00:39:58,460
Rym: you know if I'm if I get to The point of will I attack someone but yes once I am in the I have reached a decision tree of will I attack this?

577
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,222
Rym: Person or not.

578
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:04,880
Rym: It comes down to something so simple as do I have a three advantage or not?

579
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,757
Rym: If the answer is yes, I attack no matter what?

580
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:12,460
Scott: Well, I won't attack if a if winning won't get me a significant number of points.

581
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:24,285
Rym: I know because I'm not gonna buy is fine - right, but I'm not gonna hurry up the end of the game if I'm behind What I said, I have all these other ones that get me to the point of if attacking is even an option Mmm.

582
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:28,098
Rym: if attacking is an option So attacking is only an option for me.

583
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:45,640
Rym: If one it is not likely to give a player who has a chance of beating me Points in a color that I know they're deficient in Mmm, if it is not if it is likely to give me points in a color that I am deficient in All the obverse like cases of that are also, you know They're like, I don't care.

584
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:56,428
Rym: I'm not likely to attack or get to the point of deciding to attack if I don't need that color unless it causes disruption to A player who is likely to be me The treasure situation all these other factors.

585
00:40:56,729 --> 00:41:08,138
Rym: There's so many of them that I could probably enumerate them all But I've played the game so much that it becomes a little more than patterns to where and you'll notice this if you play a lot of games.

586
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:21,075
Rym: Sometimes I'm calculating in power grid I have a gut feeling for what I should do and then I do a calculation to validate like Will I have enough money to do the thing that my gut heuristic tells me to do?

587
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:22,946
Rym: if the answer is yes I just do it.

588
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:31,040
Rym: if the answer is no Then I fall back on these more complex heuristics to figure out what I should do because my gut heuristic obviously was mistaken.

589
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:43,227
Scott: Now if you don't have a heuristic either because you're new at a game or you're not sure right what you should try to do usually to come up with a heuristic right is What will get you the most victory points.

590
00:41:43,348 --> 00:41:48,600
Scott: most games are victory point games and if it's not a victory point game You got to think you know, what will help you win, right?

591
00:41:48,840 --> 00:42:03,596
Scott: So find the thing that makes you win whatever that may be most money most points get to the end the fastest and look at your options and Can you immediately tell which one of those will get you the most victory the closest to winning?

592
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:04,680
Scott: if you can't tell?

593
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,640
Scott: Just fucking pick one because you'll be able to tell after playing the game more, right?

594
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,544
Scott: Don't sit around and try.

595
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:12,454
Scott: if you can't immediately tell right away.

596
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:14,362
Scott: Don't bother Right?

597
00:42:14,643 --> 00:42:18,394
Scott: that then think about it during other people's turns, you know, which one?

598
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:27,851
Scott: that way you're not wasting everyone's time You know trying to cram in like multiple sessions of game learning into your first playthrough Now say you can't figure it out at all.

599
00:42:27,932 --> 00:42:28,879
Rym: Like you have nowhere to go.

600
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:31,349
Rym: It doesn't matter if you're acting randomly and you lose.

601
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,554
Rym: you're just doing the best you can.

602
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:34,060
Rym: the key there is pattern recognition.

603
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:35,466
Rym: You start to notice.

604
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:39,020
Rym: Hey Rym always goes into the castle and Kayla's and he seems to win a lot.

605
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:43,060
Rym: Oh look Rym and Scott and all those guys seem to castle all the time.

606
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:45,518
Rym: I should probably be doing that too.

607
00:42:46,152 --> 00:42:47,464
Scott: yep see now here's the thing.

608
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:57,140
Scott: in a lot of games doing what someone else is doing just brings you both down because you're fighting over a Shared resource and this other player who's not fighting over that same resource and is doing something different will win.

609
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:03,571
Scott: But that's okay because if you're a noob and you know You can't already play this game quickly and make your decisions quickly.

610
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:06,220
Scott: You don't have your directional heuristic set up, right?

611
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:20,214
Scott: Better to copy someone else to learn and get the feel for what they're doing Because you'll do a lot better than just doing whatever you feel like that's wrong and you'll just be in the shitter and then they Will be fighting for supremacy.

612
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:27,819
Scott: now at least make a good placement and feel better about yourself and learn some of the patterns of movement by copying somehow in

613
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:42,712
Rym: a super super generalized case if you go before Someone else in whatever sense that entails you are better off copying that person Then copying a person who goes before you whatever there

614
00:43:42,752 --> 00:43:42,933
Scott: is.

615
00:43:43,013 --> 00:43:49,356
Scott: if there is a game with some sort of turn sequence Right, you want to do the same thing as someone who goes after you.

616
00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:54,500
Scott: that for example Let's say power grid and you're you're going in with the coal power plants, right?

617
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,955
Scott: Well, you want to buy your coal before the other guy who buys coal.

618
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:09,799
Scott: if you have to buy coal second And the so other guy who likes coal is going before you don't do coal do oil or something else because it's gonna be worse For you if he steals all the coal out from under you.

619
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:14,620
Rym: So back to more, you know non game theory ish sort of skills.

620
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:18,005
Rym: Learn how to shuffle cards.

621
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:18,847
Scott: Holy shit.

622
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:25,815
Scott: Yeah, there's so many mechanical things you have to do in a game shuffling cards rolling

623
00:44:25,856 --> 00:44:28,667
Rym: dice uni if you want if you're serious about playing counting

624
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:41,864
Scott: thing moving is moving a space, you know addition and subtraction moving upon and the Number of spaces in one jump and not sitting there going one, two, three, four five six unless it's a joke Just to piss people.

625
00:44:41,884 --> 00:44:47,477
Rym: Yeah, I mean if I in Carcassonne if I get a bunch of points in one go I go one two three.

626
00:44:49,181 --> 00:44:51,660
Scott: But that's just trash talk that's not slow play.

627
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,528
Rym: Yeah I don't need to do that to calculate 17 plus.

628
00:44:54,608 --> 00:45:11,952
Scott: counting your money quickly handling bills and coins quickly and it Yeah being it if you're playing poker the ability just Neil be able to count the chips quickly and send them out into the Into the table instead of sitting there being like one two, right those sorts of things Really bother everyone because you've already made a decision.

629
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:13,397
Scott: You know what you're gonna do, right?

630
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,480
Scott: You're just like you just can't shuffle your cards and everyone is sitting there waiting for you.

631
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:25,040
Rym: You think this might be obvious, but no I see people who literally not only can't shuffle cards, but never get better at it.

632
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:30,268
Rym: They just like throw all their Dominion cards in a pile and I go On the table.

633
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:32,039
Scott: that is not tournament acceptable.

634
00:45:32,502 --> 00:45:34,730
Rym: You at least need to know a proper card.

635
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:36,277
Rym: shuffle or the like.

636
00:45:36,377 --> 00:45:37,000
Rym: drop shuffle.

637
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:42,798
Scott: And if you don't know how to do some sort of card shuffling YouTube go to YouTube watch videos of people doing it.

638
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,768
Scott: go to The drugstore buy a deck of bicycle cards.

639
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:46,932
Scott: write a real card deck.

640
00:45:46,972 --> 00:45:48,015
Scott: Not a cheap-ass one.

641
00:45:48,055 --> 00:45:49,560
Scott: That's really not nicely coded.

642
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:51,005
Scott: You know a nice smooth one.

643
00:45:51,547 --> 00:45:52,772
Scott: open it up and freaking.

644
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:59,980
Scott: watch that video and keep doing it Over and over until you can fucking do it and don't give me that small hand big hand bullshit, right?

645
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:07,218
Scott: I could shuffle cards and I was three years old and I can still shuffle cards and my grandpa showed me I just watch what he was doing and copied it until I could do it.

646
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,704
Rym: So I was the same thing.

647
00:46:08,744 --> 00:46:21,834
Scott: if you need YouTube grandpa, then I once played in a magic tournament with a 300 card deck Mostly as a joke because the kids No deck limit, but you must have a deck that can be shuffled in a reasonable amount of time.

648
00:46:22,075 --> 00:46:32,370
Rym: So, uh, I Didn't win the tournament, but I got to the finals because everyone around me was scrubs and that was basically Trash talk the deck his kids to sit down.

649
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:35,220
Rym: They'd be like they'd look at this deck and they'd be like, what the fuck?

650
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,398
Rym: Is that I'm like, it's got five colors bitches.

651
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:42,272
Scott: You couldn't play anything for like the first ten turns.

652
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:42,674
Scott: You're lucky.

653
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:45,087
Scott: No one tried to set you on fire Just they didn't.

654
00:46:45,188 --> 00:46:46,255
Rym: they weren't good at the game.

655
00:46:46,275 --> 00:46:47,140
Rym: It was actually reasonably.

656
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:51,100
Rym: It was actually only three colors and had a fuck ton of artifacts.

657
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:53,231
Rym: Yeah, because none of them had.

658
00:46:53,412 --> 00:46:54,598
Rym: it's like no magic tournament.

659
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:55,000
Scott: I played him.

660
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,383
Scott: I was a kid.

661
00:46:55,404 --> 00:46:56,999
Scott: people knew what the fuck they were doing except me.

662
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,869
Rym: Yeah, I was in one tournament where I lost due to poison.

663
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,598
Rym: Yeah, I almost I was really not happy.

664
00:47:02,959 --> 00:47:11,184
Rym: So similar to this learn a gaming lexicon because most board games are Very similar.

665
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:15,579
Rym: if someone says there's going to be a card draft You should know what that means.

666
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:17,086
Rym: Like it's one thing.

667
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:22,149
Rym: if I'm gonna teach someone how to play a board game and like and I tell them Alright, so we start with a card draft.

668
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:23,436
Rym: It works like this.

669
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:27,238
Rym: Let's go versus explaining what a card draft is.

670
00:47:28,661 --> 00:47:39,455
Rym: Also, if I have to explain what the card draft is in a fundamental level then the people at the table seem to not Understand it even if I go through the mechanical stuff because now they're not just learning the game.

671
00:47:39,475 --> 00:47:41,020
Rym: They're learning all these other pieces.

672
00:47:41,881 --> 00:47:49,900
Rym: It's like if you have to learn how auctions work because you've never heard of an auction before now Can't play a bidding game because you've never heard of an auction.

673
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:50,582
Rym: Yeah, you're.

674
00:47:50,622 --> 00:47:54,957
Rym: now you're learning the auction game before you even get to the power grid part of power grid.

675
00:47:55,037 --> 00:47:57,446
Scott: Yeah So what's an auction?

676
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,638
Scott: Oh fuck an auction is only one small part of this game.

677
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:01,260
Scott: We are fucked.

678
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,949
Rym: You've got to learn a basic gaming lexicon.

679
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:05,936
Rym: Are you gonna take forever on your goddamn turn?

680
00:48:06,338 --> 00:48:09,696
Rym: Mm-hmm Honestly, if you do all those things your terms are gonna be like that.

681
00:48:09,716 --> 00:48:13,919
Scott: Yeah I mean really the biggest one is when it's someone else's turn.

682
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:19,260
Scott: Think about what you're gonna do in your turn and then if you're still paying attention, you'll be alert.

683
00:48:19,705 --> 00:48:32,444
Scott: I fail this sometimes, you know You'll be alert when your turn begins and as soon as your turn begins immediately start executing your turn and then as soon as your turn ends make sure the next person starts their turn and hopefully they will Be alert and just start taking

684
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:36,980
Rym: up and if you can't figure out what to do and everyone's already groaning give up you.

685
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:38,805
Rym: There's no way you're gonna figure it out.

686
00:48:38,946 --> 00:48:45,025
Rym: act randomly based on the simplest directional heuristic you can and go far Mm-hmm.

687
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:48,470
Scott: There anything else to say about taking your goddamn turn?

688
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,735
Rym: I think we've covered.

689
00:48:49,775 --> 00:48:52,926
Rym: if you do those ten things You counted all the things.

690
00:48:52,946 --> 00:48:56,920
Rym: Yeah, we came up with them arbitrarily as we were talking, but there ended up being ten.

691
00:48:57,744 --> 00:48:58,018
Scott: Okay.

692
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,920
Rym: So yeah, so I guess there's one side discussion.

693
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:09,240
Rym: How do you deal with if you're not me and Scott who are just perfectly willing to be assholes to people and you're playing a?

694
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,731
Rym: Friendly game with someone who won't take their turn.

695
00:49:10,771 --> 00:49:11,739
Rym: How do you get him to take their turn?

696
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:16,139
Scott: Well, you can say, you know, listen Can you hurry it up?

697
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:19,940
Scott: Like, you know, you can get a stopwatch and show them how long their turn is taking.

698
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:21,344
Scott: You can.

699
00:49:21,384 --> 00:49:27,469
Scott: you can just get up and ignore the game because you if you already decided your turn Because you got so much extra time to decide right?

700
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:28,433
Scott: That's another thing.

701
00:49:28,453 --> 00:49:29,316
Scott: You gotta think about right?

702
00:49:29,797 --> 00:49:33,740
Scott: You might be thinking Oh, I'll win by taking a long time on my turn so I get the right decision.

703
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:39,400
Scott: That is never the case What you're really doing is you're giving everyone else so much more time to think about their turns.

704
00:49:39,982 --> 00:49:43,555
Scott: So in power grid you want to take your turn faster to hurt the other players.

705
00:49:43,595 --> 00:49:44,297
Scott: they have less time.

706
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:50,360
Rym: to power grid I have heuristics, but if you take five minutes on your turn, I'm gonna count every fucking electro.

707
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:57,445
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to count out like exact actions and exact numbers of dollars I've got.

708
00:49:57,465 --> 00:50:03,320
Rym: you'll see if I play a game of power to people who are slow You'll see me like lining up multiple turns of bullshit in front of me.

709
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,260
Rym: I'll be like making stacks of bills counted out for yeah

710
00:50:07,283 --> 00:50:18,793
Scott: Because you know unlike some other people who get distracted and go look at something else while the game is going on like some TV Or some conversation if you give me more goddamn time I'm gonna think about the next turn in the next turn in the next turn.

711
00:50:18,813 --> 00:50:20,460
Scott: You're only fucking yourself over.

712
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:21,559
Scott: You're better off.

713
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:27,329
Scott: The only way you're gonna have a chance is if you play your turn quickly, it might not be the best possible decision But it'll be.

714
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:37,420
Scott: you know Good enough maybe and you won't give me time to make the ultimate best Humanly possible decision in the universe because I waited five whole minutes for you to do your turn.

715
00:50:37,781 --> 00:50:41,960
Rym: Now the reality is that if you're taking a long time on your turn your friends are taking long times on their turns.

716
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:43,244
Rym: I hate to say it.

717
00:50:43,425 --> 00:50:45,295
Scott: basically just it's gonna make the game on fun.

718
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:51,780
Rym: If everyone's slow That's why people hate like monopoly, but it also means that you and your friends are all collectively not that good at games.

719
00:50:52,422 --> 00:50:55,711
Scott: Mmm now play easier games until you get faster now.

720
00:50:55,872 --> 00:51:06,020
Rym: if you get better at these things and you find that like if say you Start you follow our advice and you start taking your turns faster You're gonna find that you start winning a lot more often and you're gonna get into the boat.

721
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,110
Scott: You ever see the guy who takes slow on his turn be the guy.

722
00:51:09,612 --> 00:51:11,218
Rym: well except Scott Johnson in a choir, right?

723
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,401
Scott: Well, okay.

724
00:51:12,462 --> 00:51:16,640
Scott: The other thing to think about right is you know exactly that the analysis paralysis.

725
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:21,374
Scott: Sometimes it could be the game's fault that people are taking a long time.

726
00:51:21,394 --> 00:51:33,660
Scott: those games suck and I don't play them anymore Now, you know because the game is constructed in such a way that you know Like chess people take a long time on their turn if there's no chess, but look there's chess clocks to deal with that.

727
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:45,740
Scott: But sometimes there aren't chess clocks and people take forever and because that gives them an advantage right what you need to do is Just not play those games or bring in the chess clock, right?

728
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:53,471
Scott: And I think adding a timer to a games even if it's not part of the rules is perfectly Okay in a situation of an analysis paralysis game.

729
00:51:53,491 --> 00:51:55,919
Scott: if it's the game's fault that taking.

730
00:51:55,939 --> 00:52:09,949
Scott: you know There's this long, you know time to take your turn It won't hurt the game to throw a timer in there and it's pretty easy to come up with a rule for the timer Such as you know when the timer is up You must make a move or you lose.

731
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:14,003
Scott: just if you can't think of any other rule like some sort of penalty that doesn't fuck The game up.

732
00:52:14,023 --> 00:52:16,800
Scott: just say you lose game over because someone took too long.

733
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:23,092
Rym: It's not say you start taking your turns faster and none of your friends do and you start finding That's not fun to play games with your friends anymore.

734
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:23,757
Rym: I hate to say this.

735
00:52:23,778 --> 00:52:26,725
Rym: it Means your friends are scrubs.

736
00:52:27,106 --> 00:52:30,095
Rym: Yeah in that sense this word air hockey problem.

737
00:52:30,195 --> 00:52:31,960
Rym: The term scrubs have been thrown around a lot.

738
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:41,720
Rym: I'll try to find the article But if I can't find it then I'm not gonna link to it obviously But I read an article where a guy came up with a really good definition of scrub because I'd use the word forever.

739
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,825
Rym: But this guy is a good definition.

740
00:52:42,885 --> 00:52:44,794
Rym: It's someone who plays games.

741
00:52:45,176 --> 00:52:47,324
Rym: Mm-hmm a lot But never.

742
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:52,460
Rym: but after a certain point basically never invest to get better than that point.

743
00:52:52,982 --> 00:52:57,960
Rym: Well simultaneously denigrating the skills it takes to get beyond that point.

744
00:52:58,321 --> 00:53:02,639
Rym: It's the Street Fighter guy who says you using, you know flowchart can is cheap.

745
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:11,289
Rym: Or the Starcraft guy who's like, oh you're just doing you know, you're just APMing it up and microing me Like yeah, that's how you get that's how you're good at Starcraft.

746
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:11,469
Scott: Yeah.

747
00:53:11,509 --> 00:53:13,758
Scott: See I say yeah, you're beating me with your APM's.

748
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:14,240
Scott: exactly.

749
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:15,606
Scott: That's why you're better than me.

750
00:53:15,827 --> 00:53:17,654
Scott: I just do not feel like doing that.

751
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:21,169
Rym: I don't call it cheap, but It's not cheap.

752
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,017
Scott: it's hard as hell.

753
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:33,311
Rym: if you Something's easy to do and wins if you move beyond Being a scrub to getting better at games and you take turns faster You will find that you just can't play games with scrubs anymore.

754
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:34,335
Rym: And you know what?

755
00:53:35,057 --> 00:53:35,840
Rym: It's fucking awesome.

756
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,589
Rym: You realize when we want to play a board game we sit down 45 minutes later We're done with the game of Puerto Rico star.

757
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:43,600
Scott: We can play a lot of goddamn games.

758
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,488
Scott: It's so much more fun because you can play.

759
00:53:45,509 --> 00:53:46,895
Scott: you can learn new games quickly.

760
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:47,497
Scott: You can play.

761
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,408
Scott: exist games You already know much faster.

762
00:53:49,468 --> 00:53:55,736
Scott: modern art takes maybe 40 minutes Maybe maybe and modern art is a good example, right one technique to use.

763
00:53:55,756 --> 00:53:56,840
Scott: we talked about the auction thing.

764
00:53:57,021 --> 00:53:58,386
Rym: Oh, wait, I'll run my auction.

765
00:53:58,406 --> 00:54:01,619
Rym: All right, do I hear $1 going once going twice three top two.

766
00:54:02,203 --> 00:54:05,240
Rym: Alright, I bid three going once going twice or three to five.

767
00:54:07,223 --> 00:54:10,397
Rym: See how I'm forcing Scott to immediately jump on yep.

768
00:54:11,803 --> 00:54:19,890
Scott: But no if someone's having trouble in a complex game where there's a lot of different things Play a game that only has one of those things right.

769
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:28,880
Scott: if people are having trouble with a card draft at the beginning of seasons Just play seven wonders instead so that then once they got the hang of that then you can move up.

770
00:54:29,201 --> 00:54:36,345
Scott: you know if someone's having trouble in auctions and power grid play modern art so they can just deal with Auctions only if people don't.

771
00:54:36,445 --> 00:54:48,540
Scott: you know, it's this progression of you know learning curve that people have to go through and it's you know Video games often since you know, especially long ones have this learning curve built in whether they teach you one skill at a time.

772
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:50,508
Scott: They'll have a level where all you do is jump.

773
00:54:50,568 --> 00:54:55,268
Scott: then in the next level you jump and shoot right jump and shoot Jump and shoot man.

774
00:54:55,328 --> 00:54:57,558
Scott: Yeah, and then in the next level you slide.

775
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:58,723
Scott: next level You change weapons.

776
00:54:58,743 --> 00:54:59,847
Scott: the next level you fly right.

777
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:03,140
Scott: if you can't do that with a board game you play a board game.

778
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:04,340
Scott: You got to play the whole thing at once.

779
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:04,984
Scott: It's not like turn.

780
00:55:05,124 --> 00:55:06,733
Scott: one is easy turn and turn right.

781
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:07,880
Scott: very few games are like that.

782
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:17,794
Rym: In fact, if you want to get back to the Garfield book the term he uses for this called bushiness Which is a really nice bushiness was how much I'm getting at is that?

783
00:55:17,854 --> 00:55:21,506
Rym: bushiness is the basically the number of sort of Directions or decisions you could make.

784
00:55:21,726 --> 00:55:26,826
Rym: the first turns of games tend to be the most important and most difficult Mmm, and the decisions.

785
00:55:26,946 --> 00:55:30,197
Rym: actually you have fewer decisions as the game goes on after a certain point.

786
00:55:30,478 --> 00:55:30,538
Scott: Mmm.

787
00:55:31,383 --> 00:55:33,239
Scott: But anyway, what you want to do is you want to play?

788
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:40,630
Scott: Simpler games games that have less going on to where you can learn just one thing Right and make those you're starting game.

789
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:41,976
Rym: I mean we talked a lot about how.

790
00:55:42,016 --> 00:55:42,960
Rym: you know, we don't like settlers.

791
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:43,683
Rym: You know what?

792
00:55:43,743 --> 00:55:46,494
Rym: I love settlers for like two years playing.

793
00:55:46,574 --> 00:55:48,080
Scott: It's someone's brand new to board games.

794
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:50,380
Scott: Don't just be like, hey, this is the best one is Eclipse.

795
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:57,070
Scott: It's like the same people do the same shit with anime like hey first Madoka first anime you should watch ever.

796
00:55:57,111 --> 00:55:59,160
Scott: It's like no probably not right.

797
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:04,380
Scott: You got to watch something that teaches the fundamental parts before you go to hard mode.

798
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:11,030
Scott: I don't you no matter who it is on this earth even incredible genius person Right if they do not have experience with a thing.

799
00:56:11,472 --> 00:56:13,540
Scott: They need to start an easy mode for the thing.

800
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:22,065
Rym: We've played settlers of Catan for several years Regularly and toward the end.

801
00:56:22,105 --> 00:56:25,695
Scott: it teaches you trading and you know territory placement.

802
00:56:25,735 --> 00:56:33,080
Rym: after several years of playing this game We got to a point where we started to suspect that the game was random.

803
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:41,335
Rym: Yeah In fact, we developed these position weird positional heuristics where we realized that whoever got a head first Always lost because they got robbed.

804
00:56:41,496 --> 00:56:41,900
Rym: all fuck.

805
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:51,275
Rym: so everyone was shooting for second place to then try to have the stealth victory to occlude the positional heuristic and hide the fact that they were actually ahead like hoping.

806
00:56:51,295 --> 00:56:59,660
Scott: people don't realize that I am Two turns away from largest road longest better go for longest road and largest army, so no one sees my victory points.

807
00:57:00,901 --> 00:57:02,386
Scott: Right yeah, anyway.

808
00:57:02,988 --> 00:57:03,569
Rym: I think we're done.

809
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,071
Rym: So you know what.

810
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:06,379
Scott: take your turn or I will hit you.

811
00:57:12,643 --> 00:57:15,200
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
