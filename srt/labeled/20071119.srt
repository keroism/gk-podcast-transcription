1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,886
Rym: It's Monday November 19th.

2
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:12,291
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:15,320
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:19,825
Rym: We begin a series about Google by talking about the world before Google.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:25,397
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:30,409
Rym: Well, we're still alive.

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,503
Rym: Yeah, the weekend didn't go quite as badly as it could have.

8
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:36,130
Scott: no it could have been much worse.

9
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:49,223
Rym: I was very tired yesterday, but I slept a whole lot because somehow yesterday You know I find it interesting that you see we went to this party which now if Last year's or the last time a party like this happened was to be believed.

10
00:00:49,885 --> 00:01:00,270
Rym: We were expecting to Basically have to fend off a horde of Visigoths or in this case Possibly Ostrogoths in the corner of the house hoping not to be vomited upon.

11
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:01,854
Scott: Yeah, that I mean this.

12
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:06,648
Scott: this exact party has happened once before and we didn't go because of other reasons.

13
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:08,578
Rym: well because the we came Out and we were here to get it.

14
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:21,455
Scott: Yeah, but oh wow Yeah, it was exactly a year ago, so Yeah, because the we as I think a year old today or something like that Regardless the the same party happened before and the tails were Vomitacious.

15
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:27,248
Rym: they were they were of a myth vomit ik widis All right, they were vomitoriums.

16
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:34,319
Scott: And so we expected that since we're going to the party for the second time It's ever happened that it would be a similar event.

17
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,253
Scott: yet It was not.

18
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:44,661
Rym: it was quite enjoyable, but I think that the most telling thing was that at the end of it all Scott did not drink and Alex did not drink.

19
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:50,990
Rym: I drunk quite a bit But yet in the morning and the rest of the next day the three of us had the same hangover.

20
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:57,111
Scott: Yeah, there wasn't too much sleeping going on now not so much We had.

21
00:01:57,332 --> 00:02:01,470
Rym: we stayed up until like three the first night playing apples to apples then arguing about crap.

22
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:09,606
Scott: Yeah, I generally just got the same bad feeling you get whenever you don't get enough sleep and do too much stuff And then the next night we were gonna go to bed at like three.

23
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:14,673
Rym: everything was all set And then we stayed up another hour arguing with some guy about Comics.

24
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:18,949
Rym: now issues are kind of to suck and collecting comics is kind of dumb if you're trying to make money off of it.

25
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:30,130
Scott: yeah, especially if you're doing it for money, but The point is is that you know I had to drive home and everyone else is sleeping in the car And then he finally got home, and then we went out to eat.

26
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,901
Scott: We came home, and it was actually really early like nine ish.

27
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:37,115
Scott: so after finishing reading the the book I was reading which didn't take very long.

28
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:46,870
Scott: I actually went to sleep stupidly early, and I got enough sleep to revive and Thanksgiving I'll need to work two more days before I'm off again, so yeah, and I got the Friday off.

29
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,670
Rym: So I'm doing my annual go out to Rochester go to Millennium kind of pilgrimage.

30
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:53,609
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what we want there.

31
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:58,890
Rym: I'm gonna email the Millennium guy ahead of time and see if he can get me a copy of Dune before I get there.

32
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,296
Scott: Oh, that's a good call.

33
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:01,241
Rym: I'll pretty much sell him.

34
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,446
Rym: I'm willing to pay up to like 150 bucks.

35
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:06,350
Rym: That's a good call, but anyway, let's just get into the news.

36
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,342
Rym: I kind of want to get done with the show and go to bed.

37
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:09,550
Rym: Yeah, super tired.

38
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,039
Rym: I just actually want to continue to be well-rested.

39
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,830
Scott: I just want to read a bunch of manga and stuff.

40
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,430
Scott: I'm gonna get so much reading and coding stuff done with the Thanksgiving and all the business and no it's gonna be good times.

41
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,120
Scott: but for now Tech news always slow in late November.

42
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,290
Scott: I mean every tech podcast is like oh, what are we talking about?

43
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,181
Rym: But what about all those rumors of a 14 or 13 inch MacBook?

44
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:33,875
Scott: Those were like a weeks ago.

45
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:34,436
Rym: I know.

46
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:35,400
Rym: and whatever happened to that?

47
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,590
Scott: the rumors don't believe anything until you see it people.

48
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:39,173
Rym: Oh, I know.

49
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:39,756
Rym: I don't believe it.

50
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:42,190
Rym: But at the same time not that Apple cares about me.

51
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,744
Rym: But I have to say if that comes to be true I'm probably going to buy one pretty quickly if it's true.

52
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:50,090
Scott: It's probably not a bad purchase.

53
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:56,795
Scott: I might have purchased one if I had needed a laptop when around now instead of around back And I kind of need one now.

54
00:03:56,876 --> 00:04:04,247
Rym: now that I'm really happy with what I got now that I'm once again a flushing money And anything that I can spend money on that'll make my life better is worth it.

55
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,965
Scott: Yep Alright, so what kind of news you got over there?

56
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:15,449
Rym: Oh, yeah, I got to start Alright, so I find this interesting because I saw this article on slashdot and I read it and I had thoughts about it.

57
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:24,714
Rym: Meanwhile Scott read an article on dig that was about something that actually happened because the article on slashdot was basically just Wouldn't it be bad?

58
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:27,684
Rym: if is it stupid - should we worry about?

59
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:29,250
Rym: and Scott's article was?

60
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:31,596
Rym: X happened it sucked.

61
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:32,479
Rym: We should have worried.

62
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:36,610
Scott: I don't know about the reliability of either of that article, but whatever I didn't read it.

63
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,172
Rym: I didn't see it.

64
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:38,115
Rym: Scott told me about it.

65
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:47,730
Scott: I just saw a headline and I inspected it very cursor Lee Uh-huh, so but he definitely did it what there was an article that did say what we're about to say.

66
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:53,147
Rym: But anyway, you might be familiar with these websites like tiny URL at Alia.

67
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,170
Rym: There's a million of these things.

68
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,810
Rym: It's you know, you type in your most popular.

69
00:04:56,991 --> 00:05:02,110
Rym: You type in a URL on the little site and it'll give you back a shorter URL like I type.

70
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:06,808
Rym: www.scott makes inappropriate URLs that imply homosexuality.

71
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:17,452
Rym: calm and shortly good gobbledygook gobbledygook gobbledygook gobbledygook and it shortens the two tiny URL comm slash Uh-huh.

72
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:18,918
Rym: I hope that isn't something real.

73
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,182
Rym: I don't even I'll go see.

74
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:21,507
Scott: it is something I'll go find out.

75
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:37,208
Rym: but These sorts of services are kind of a mixed bag and even though tiny URL is kind of known and respected and trusted at the same time my personal opinion is that there is really never been a Useful purpose for anything like this.

76
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:42,450
Rym: I mean a lot of P. and the worst thing is I see people using it not even for the real.

77
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:58,509
Rym: I guess the only legitimate thing I could see it for which is trying to tell someone a URL over the phone or trying to tell someone a URL in a radio show or something, but I See people posting tiny URLs in Forums because they don't know how to make a link.

78
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:04,890
Rym: So instead of using HTML or bbcode or whatever they post a tiny URL in text in a forum.

79
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:15,290
Scott: Well, it'd be easier would be a website where you go to and you You just type in the crazy URL and then it makes you an HTML link that you can copy and paste.

80
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:17,817
Rym: That is kind of sad if you need that.

81
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,560
Rym: It's the internet.

82
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:29,770
Rym: I know I know I'll be perfectly but to me HTML or at least bbcode is pretty much the language You need to understand to be wiki code to count at the internet.

83
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,729
Rym: You don't count if you can't do one of those as far as I could tell.

84
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:34,669
Scott: Well, at least not at the internet but on the web.

85
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:41,630
Scott: But you can't you cannot operate on the web if you don't at least know the basics of HTML and or bbcode.

86
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,613
Scott: It's just not gonna happen.

87
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:46,366
Scott: You need to know how to at least make a link a href whatever.

88
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:55,770
Rym: but I mean I mean, I'll say pretty much straightforward I feel that people who use these services use them poorly and stupidly and I really see no legitimate reason to bother with them.

89
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,106
Rym: James Randi always uses it I know and he shouldn't.

90
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:07,850
Rym: The worst thing in the world is when there is ever a link in a website that uses a tiny URL Why all you did was add a layer of possible failure?

91
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,507
Scott: Yeah, I mean if tiny URL goes down now your link doesn't work Even if the site that you were trying to link to in the first place is still up.

92
00:07:14,829 --> 00:07:21,417
Rym: also I'll say that I just in principle do not click on those kinds of URLs because Who knows where they can go?

93
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:27,222
Rym: I don't know what's on the other side and while I am NOT I was going to say immune but then I said not and I'm so.

94
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:33,290
Rym: I am NOT immune to Being Rick rolled because I'm on to Linux and to Firefox.

95
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,789
Rym: But nonetheless if I see a URL and I can't tell where it goes I'm not going to risk going to a site that might try to Rick roll me.

96
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:44,950
Scott: Yeah, I mean you part a very important security feature of web browser.

97
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:58,802
Scott: You hold the mouse over the link and the URL shows up in the bottom and you know You look at that URL of where the link is gonna go and you say aha I know where this link is going and if it says the link is going to like yahoe.com You're like yahoe.com.

98
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,830
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure that's totally legitimate and free of evil.

99
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,941
Rym: Sorny magnet box.

100
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:07,310
Scott: Oh Look at all these great name brands.

101
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:17,090
Scott: but yeah, so the fact if you you can take a tiny URL and Point that to say some horrible evil website of doom and then someone hovers over and they go Oh tiny URL.

102
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,075
Scott: I guess I have to click.

103
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:27,169
Rym: granted evil someone who trusts tiny URL Probably wouldn't have figured out that yahoe.com slash gobbledygook is somehow bad.

104
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:28,453
Rym: Yeah, probably.

105
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:34,510
Rym: or the famous microsoft.com slash whole bunch of stuff that actually just redirects you to evil.com.

106
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,332
Scott: Ten euro useless We don't.

107
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,801
Scott: if you're using it stop just learn how to make a link.

108
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:45,041
Rym: The wonderful thing is there's this slash dot article I'm linking to where people are all.

109
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:46,270
Rym: should we worry?

110
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,237
Rym: Is this gonna break the internet?

111
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:50,668
Rym: and I'm gonna answer all those questions one.

112
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:51,250
Rym: Should we worry?

113
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:54,090
Rym: No, it only hurts people who suck - will it break the internet?

114
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,427
Rym: No, in fact, it'll make the internet better because if you link to it with a tiny URL probably wasn't worth linking to.

115
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:03,098
Rym: yeah Three and this is my favorite thing.

116
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:19,865
Rym: a lot of people on slash dot and other places discussing this Effectively made this point that I see coming up a lot all the time on the internet and it's always always made by high school kids or Freshman IT CS people where they'll say oh well

117
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:20,427
Scott: tiny

118
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:28,154
Rym: URL blah DNS broken blah DNS bad blah DNS last legs blah something something DNS Obsolete.

119
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:31,146
Scott: people don't understand the DNS like the open DNS guy.

120
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:35,740
Rym: Yeah DNS is just fine and even worse is the.

121
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:49,043
Rym: the one argument I saw that it was infuriating and I had to resist the urge To type furiously at this person was well, maybe we didn't use all these so-called content management systems that make Indecipherable URLs.

122
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,513
Rym: now I don't know.

123
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:55,854
Rym: for some reason a URL that includes the date of the post or the title of the post isn't so Indecipherable to me.

124
00:09:56,236 --> 00:10:08,517
Scott: I think the problem is is that a lot of the context but content management systems Right are built on top, you know, people are running these things on Apache and it's it's quite difficult to you Know you need an HD access file.

125
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:20,407
Scott: You need to do extra work to get clean URLs on You know with an Apache web server Because one I mean unless you're doing something clever with the URL like delicious or the.

126
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:21,330
Rym: all those sites.

127
00:10:21,752 --> 00:10:24,706
Rym: All the web 2.0 slash something does something for you.

128
00:10:24,726 --> 00:10:30,050
Rym: Mm-hmm People don't need to know the URLs of specific things.

129
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:32,941
Rym: DNS you only need to know the top page.

130
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:35,370
Rym: if you ever want to go deeper than the top of something.

131
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,156
Rym: Why didn't you bookmark it?

132
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:38,501
Rym: Maybe you're following a link.

133
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:44,440
Rym: No one calls you and says hey, man You should go to devour ag org slash blog.

134
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:46,084
Rym: They said they will one.

135
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:46,987
Rym: you shouldn't call someone.

136
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:47,970
Rym: tell them URL anyway.

137
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,719
Scott: Yep, you just email them.

138
00:10:49,739 --> 00:10:50,222
Scott: send my link.

139
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:55,130
Scott: if they're on the internet and they can go to the link You can email or I am it to them or they'll see it in a forum or something.

140
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:07,298
Rym: Yep, podcasters and fury me with this as well since a lot of podcasters will be like they'll mention something in the show And they say oh, yeah, I go to tiny URL something now Why not just put the link in your show notes?

141
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:15,230
Rym: because if they if the person listening can get to the internet To follow that tiny URL that you just told him they can get to your website.

142
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:21,797
Scott: And if they're good, there's more likely that they're going to remember the website of the podcast They listen to often than it is.

143
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:27,289
Scott: they're going to remember the URL that was said in the middle of a podcast That they listen to often.

144
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:39,130
Rym: So yeah Tiny URL is kind of dumb and I guess it was useful for like a span of six or seven months Back before email and I am kind of evolved to being working as opposed to not working.

145
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,879
Rym: But they didn't really exist back then.

146
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,603
Rym: so it doesn't matter.

147
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:43,950
Rym: Yeah, there's never been a use.

148
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:49,710
Scott: No, tiny URL bad useless stupid if anyone can think of actually legitimate use for it.

149
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:59,410
Scott: I'd like to hear that I defy you to give me a legitimate use of tiny URL and You know pretty much the only thing you're gonna come up with is makeup for user and confidence.

150
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:02,488
Scott: Okay, so there was another story on slash.

151
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:04,480
Rym: that Another story on slash.

152
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,430
Scott: when it when it's slow tech news Slash that is the only place you can go because they are the only people who have somewhat real tech news every day.

153
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:17,650
Rym: Not only that but it updates on a set like it just updates on this regular like tick tick tick.

154
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,424
Rym: It's not a precise tick like every 1.8 hours.

155
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:31,950
Rym: There's a story but you know Especially from people like us back when slash dot was the only real game in town if you're bored sitting somewhere You know how much time has gone by and you think well, it's about time for a new slash dot story.

156
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:32,873
Scott: Yep.

157
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:33,556
Scott: Okay.

158
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:35,745
Scott: So there's a story on slash that says the fat.

159
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,914
Scott: it's called the fastest processor You can't run.

160
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:49,475
Scott: and basically what they're talking about is like Oh, man's AMD put out this Barcelona chip and Intel is trying to push it out of the news by releasing the Intel core 2 extreme ship.

161
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:52,930
Scott: that's crazy fast and it's $1,200.

162
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:59,430
Scott: but it's stupid because you can't even use the Intel core 2 extreme shit because it won't work in any motherboard.

163
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,075
Scott: And that way.

164
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:05,203
Scott: that's what the story on slash that is saying.

165
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:08,936
Scott: the first thing I have to say is That the story is wrong.

166
00:13:09,217 --> 00:13:11,464
Scott: You can get a motherboard that can hold that chip.

167
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,310
Scott: I'm looking at one a new egg right now.

168
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,362
Scott: Let's see aces p5e3 deluxe.

169
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:20,138
Scott: Oh look front side bus 1600 megahertz.

170
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,427
Scott: What was this chip again?

171
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:24,380
Scott: 1600 megahertz front side bus.

172
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:27,774
Scott: there on the slash start article It says the fat.

173
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:32,888
Scott: blah blah blah the lack of any motherboards that support a 1600 megahertz at front side bus.

174
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,515
Scott: a new egg 1600 megahertz front side bus.

175
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:40,548
Rym: Well was that statement made in the submission or by some editor in the submission?

176
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:41,933
Rym: Oh Outstanding.

177
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,177
Rym: Yeah, remember how I laughed?

178
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,582
Rym: Yeah double that.

179
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:45,224
Scott: Yeah.

180
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:46,730
Scott: Well, here's the other thing.

181
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:54,962
Scott: I got to say this because this is alright while in this particular instance This chip is actually runnable on a ludicrously expensive motherboard.

182
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:57,790
Scott: It's a ludicrously expensive chip that you should not buy.

183
00:13:58,092 --> 00:13:59,464
Scott: I'm not saying anyone should buy this.

184
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:00,109
Scott: do not do that.

185
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,506
Scott: Unless I guess if you win the lottery and you're a nerd you might want to buy this.

186
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:05,249
Scott: but that's about it.

187
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:13,322
Scott: anyway people have been selling Unusable computer parts at ludicrously high prices for a long time.

188
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:16,030
Scott: specifically or most of all is memory.

189
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:19,702
Scott: I go on new egg right now and let's see Patriot.

190
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:24,656
Scott: memory is selling the Patriot extreme Performance two times one.

191
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:25,178
Scott: Wait a minute.

192
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,246
Rym: How many X's are in the name extreme one?

193
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,850
Scott: Yes, it's actually spelled correctly.

194
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,959
Rym: Oh They're selling to one less thing to make fun of.

195
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:43,327
Scott: they're selling to one gig sticks of DDR 3 1866 RAM, which is PC 3 15,000. ha ha ha it runs.

196
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:47,459
Scott: get this Faster than a 1600 megahertz bus.

197
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,286
Scott: this RAM goes faster than any motherboard can handle.

198
00:14:52,306 --> 00:15:01,775
Scott: oh And by the way, this motherboard that can handle a 1600 megahertz bus only does that with you know the overclocking Huh?

199
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:02,564
Rym: Yeah, huh?

200
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:17,610
Scott: So Like it's officially supported overclocking, you know, so this motherboard can handle DDR 1800 memory but this is DDR 1866 memory and It caused ludicrous amounts of money and it's completely useless.

201
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:23,150
Scott: I don't understand who buys these sticks of RAM that are faster than any motherboard can handle.

202
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,922
Scott: It's like on the same website on new egg comm.

203
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:31,679
Scott: they are selling a stick of RAM That is faster than any motherboard on new egg comm can use.

204
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,796
Scott: I Don't understand it.

205
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,208
Scott: It's just crazy Stupid nerdy people who they just like to have.

206
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:42,406
Scott: you know The best computer because it means they've a bigger penis or something.

207
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:43,029
Scott: I don't know.

208
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,539
Rym: I've just I've always bought kind of.

209
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:59,663
Rym: you know, there's the curve of diminishing returns or you know Dollars per unit awesome and you know It comes up like a hump and then it goes back down in terms of how worth it Actually is and right before it peaks is right where you want to be.

210
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:01,749
Scott: Yeah, I don't know the.

211
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:03,735
Scott: What are the people thinking?

212
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:09,571
Scott: who are buying the stuff that's ludicrously expensive and marginally faster or not faster You know what?

213
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:27,079
Rym: They're thinking they're thinking well with this computer if I turn off half the settings I might be able to play crisis Things of the day.

214
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:35,819
Rym: So last week I kind of said that I wanted to you know only do awesome stuff that isn't already on the top of dig and already on the top all those sites.

215
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,320
Rym: and That's kind of hard to do because even if something isn't on those sites It will be long before I get to talk about it tonight.

216
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:52,530
Scott: not only that but think about how much time it would take you to Dig the pun not intended through all the you know What video sites and stuff to find a thing of the day.

217
00:16:52,711 --> 00:17:09,760
Rym: actually my secret what I really need to find an obscure thing of the day has been pretty much to go to the Hot sites of yesteryear that for some reason still exist and they post stuff that's so old or so out there That no one knows about it and no one who reads dig goes to those sites anymore.

218
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:13,839
Rym: I mean if you ever really want to find something obscure just go around through meme pool.

219
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,719
Scott: Yeah, I mean before dig back in the olden day there were other sites that would collect links to cool stuff And BB spot mostly yes sites like that.

220
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,526
Scott: So if you're looking for things of the day that you know are not elsewhere That's that's the business,

221
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:41,397
Rym: but I'm gonna try a different tack now with my things of the day Instead of trying to find things you haven't seen no matter what and then telling you to watch them I feel like I'll just talk about the best thing I've seen which you probably have seen.

222
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:46,013
Rym: if you go to dig I don't know every couple of weeks because it doesn't update so frequently anymore.

223
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,743
Rym: Well, the videos don't anyway the only part I care about now.

224
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:53,480
Rym: Yep, but um, well, I'll go back to a whole commentary where I assume you've already seen it.

225
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:54,952
Rym: now you can hear my thoughts on it.

226
00:17:55,739 --> 00:18:00,280
Rym: and What better to start with than one of my new favorite music videos Knights of Cydonia?

227
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:01,901
Scott: All right.

228
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:06,800
Rym: So Knights of Cydonia is a song in guitar hero 3 and I really like the song.

229
00:18:07,072 --> 00:18:15,359
Scott: Yeah I was playing through all the songs in guitar hero 3 and I knew most of them because they're legends of rock but this is One that I did not know and liked a great deal.

230
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:17,027
Scott: Well is what I was looking for?

231
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:23,793
Rym: sadly guitar hero 2 a lot more of those than three does as Gojo and Lara proved to us by showing it to us at their party.

232
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,640
Rym: the music video to this.

233
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,979
Rym: now This isn't some like fan made a music video.

234
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:37,060
Rym: This is the music video Let's see kung fu Western unicorn laser guns robots.

235
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,906
Rym: It's up my alley.

236
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,291
Rym: The only thing I can say though.

237
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,455
Rym: The only bad thing.

238
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:43,700
Rym: Well, I guess it's good in a way.

239
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,732
Rym: I found out who stole my mustache.

240
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:50,153
Rym: I Mean his isn't quite as majestic as mine was.

241
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:55,000
Rym: it's a little bit raggedy But at the same time describe your former mustache is majestic.

242
00:18:55,362 --> 00:18:58,240
Rym: I got one picture where it's quite majestic the one where I'm wearing that tiara.

243
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:01,800
Rym: It's not in that picture that mustache is majestic.

244
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,442
Scott: No, it's not.

245
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:08,211
Rym: it only became non majestic when it started rolled around the side and became more of a molest ash Instead of a mustache.

246
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:17,040
Rym: It was always a molest Is either molest ash or a Hitler's - what it was only a Hitler's - when I finally shaved it off and I'd never.

247
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:21,133
Rym: I'd never shaved my must my nose where mustache goes my entire life.

248
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:26,920
Rym: when I finally shaved it the first time Of course, I shaved a Hitler's - yeah, and then you shaved her as well.

249
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:40,199
Rym: I I wore the Hitler's - for like four hours and my landlady came in and said She she looked like she was about to act like she was offended and she was about to say something Like what but she cracked up before she could.

250
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:42,015
Rym: It was great.

251
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:45,772
Rym: Alright, I feel bad that Hitler ruined that.

252
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,440
Rym: yeah, it used to be the chaplain.

253
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:48,605
Scott: He ruined a lot of things.

254
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:50,593
Scott: like the swastika was okay before Hitler.

255
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,239
Rym: Yeah now people freak out about it.

256
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,699
Rym: Yeah, even the backwards one.

257
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:58,830
Scott: Well, you know It's like anyway You know anyone who you can you anything can be misused and demonized.

258
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,087
Scott: that anything that some bad things can also be glorified and made I guess to appear good.

259
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,740
Rym: Yeah aggressive and militaristic Germany Hitler got rid of that.

260
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,080
Rym: No one will stand for that anymore.

261
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:13,900
Scott: The real thing that's bad is what you know, swastikas and Hitler mustache is symbolized not the things themselves not these symbols.

262
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,903
Scott: You know, I mean like.

263
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:18,576
Scott: even if Christianity is bad the cross is just a cross.

264
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:20,989
Scott: It's not hurting anybody It's just a crime.

265
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:32,239
Rym: Well, I believe The exact Unless they're using it on you in the prescribed manner.

266
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:35,426
Scott: Right, you know, I can't do my thing Dana.

267
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:42,609
Rym: No, so this video is Excellent most excellent, it's pretty excellent.

268
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,599
Rym: And this is the kind of thing that's up my alley and I'll leave it at that.

269
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:47,505
Scott: Wow, it's a great commentary.

270
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:48,930
Rym: All right, what else can I say?

271
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,053
Rym: It's awesome.

272
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:54,998
Scott: If you disagree with me, you're not awesome All right, so, you know the Mona Lisa, right?

273
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:59,078
Rym: Some paintings some famous guy did it baby something like that, right?

274
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:03,512
Scott: Yeah Well, you know people like me you're not so knowledgeable in the ways of the arts.

275
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:06,220
Scott: knowledgeable is computers not so much the arts.

276
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,652
Scott: So I know the Mona Lisa is all great and important and whatever.

277
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:11,920
Rym: Well, it's really hard to get arts installed and working properly.

278
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,933
Scott: Yeah, I know I did freaking conflicts and viruses whatever.

279
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:19,465
Scott: but so is a cool video I found on the YouTube.

280
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:20,488
Scott: I might have found it on dig.

281
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:23,940
Scott: I don't remember and it's basically called Mona Lisa.

282
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:25,165
Scott: Why so famous?

283
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,172
Scott: and this guy explains to.

284
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:37,909
Scott: he puts a picture of the Mona Lisa up there And he explains to you in as much detail as any common person should know Why it's important and why it's awesome.

285
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:48,332
Scott: and it I guess now after seeing this video the Mona Lisa is more awesome to me than it was before and If you ever wanted to know you could go watch this video.

286
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:50,180
Scott: It's like five minutes.

287
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:54,020
Scott: It won't hurt you and you guys look at the Mona Lisa, which is nice looking.

288
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:54,804
Rym: Is it just?

289
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:55,629
Rym: I haven't watched you yet.

290
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,218
Rym: Is it just one shot of the Mona Lisa?

291
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:57,640
Rym: Does he pay?

292
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:03,798
Scott: No, like he's moving the camera around and he's like drawing easy, you know superimposing things on it to demonstrate things.

293
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:12,460
Rym: and well I can just imagine that he's drawing on it like Much like the most recent Perry Bible Fellowship.

294
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:18,100
Scott: No, he's superimposing on you know, an image of the Mona Lisa to demonstrate why it's superimposed.

295
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:23,560
Scott: And you know, he has other imagery he uses to explain why it's so awesome and important and everything.

296
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,200
Rym: I'll probably watch it before I go to bed tonight.

297
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:32,089
Scott: Yeah, well go downstairs and watch it after the show cuz I want to see it again - I guess Re-instill some of the ideas in my brain.

298
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,999
Rym: That's why I really want to see what that Van Gogh movie that's coming out.

299
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:36,204
Scott: This is a Van Gogh movie.

300
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:38,795
Rym: Not the Van Gogh movie the DeGoya movie.

301
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:39,859
Scott: I don't know who DeGoya is.

302
00:22:40,564 --> 00:22:42,580
Rym: You can see how much we know as Emily just corrected me.

303
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:56,876
Rym: But yeah all I remembered was I saw a preview for a movie that was said a long time ago and involved guns in Spain and art and religion and Historical drama which is also up my alley almost as much as Cydonian Nights and their mustaches.

304
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:59,745
Scott: All right, Netflix Q it is I don't know.

305
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:01,820
Rym: I kind of want to see that in the theater, right?

306
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,173
Rym: So speaking of seeing things in the theater Google Google Google.

307
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:06,976
Rym: All right.

308
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:07,317
Rym: Good night.

309
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:07,798
Rym: All right.

310
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:14,040
Scott: So we needed some show ideas and we came up and Emily actually we sat down.

311
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,527
Rym: We're like, what are we gonna talk about this week?

312
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,054
Rym: Cuz we're only doing three shows this week.

313
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,339
Rym: hate to break it to you.

314
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:24,540
Rym: But in America, there's this holiday called eat until you feel sick and that's Thursday.

315
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:25,946
Scott: So no show Thursday.

316
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:30,547
Scott: Yeah, unless you want the eat until you feel sick Yeah, you know you're gonna hear.

317
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:31,130
Rym: you're gonna hear.

318
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:32,780
Rym: I wish I hadn't ate so much.

319
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:38,816
Scott: You're gonna hear Turkey leg in football.

320
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:41,807
Rym: I Get to watch the Lions lose.

321
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,700
Scott: Well, no, I get to you know, you know, you know happen on Sunday?

322
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:46,997
Rym: Did the Lions lose to the Giants?

323
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:52,775
Rym: Oh, man I never said that I'm a fan of the Lions.

324
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:56,019
Scott: It doesn't matter my city I don't root for the Lions.

325
00:23:56,541 --> 00:24:03,160
Rym: The Lions are nothing more than a Thanksgiving tradition in my family where we watch them wear their old-ass uniforms.

326
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,810
Scott: They're actually, you know did in all seriousness.

327
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,340
Scott: They're actually better this year than they've been in like a zillion years.

328
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,963
Scott: They're not great.

329
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:12,480
Scott: They're not win the Super Bowl or anything, but they're better than they've been in a long time.

330
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,567
Scott: So you might see them win on Thanksgiving.

331
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:16,975
Rym: that that would ruin a tradition of my.

332
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:17,999
Scott: I don't know who they're playing.

333
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,663
Scott: It does matter.

334
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:21,227
Rym: It doesn't matter.

335
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:22,531
Rym: They're not gonna win.

336
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:23,433
Rym: It's Thanksgiving.

337
00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:25,980
Rym: I've seen them be up by like 30 and then lose it.

338
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,633
Scott: Yeah, it happens, but they might anyway, uh, wow.

339
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:30,416
Rym: Oh shit.

340
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:31,580
Rym: The geeks are talking about football.

341
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:42,700
Rym: Okay, so we were trying to come up with ideas and the original idea was good But we spawned that off into like a bunch of shows to do later, but we could just talk about Google.

342
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:54,656
Rym: We realized we've never talked about Google straight up in terms of you know What it is really where it really came from why it's awesome Why all those SEO people can die in a fire, but at the same time why Google is awesome?

343
00:24:54,676 --> 00:25:01,310
Scott: because they always thwart them Mm-hmm, but then I said hey Why don't we do a show about what it was like before Google?

344
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,520
Scott: and then people fully understand why Google is awesome now.

345
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,776
Rym: We have talked about this often in the past, but I don't think we've done an actual show about it.

346
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:10,439
Rym: Mm-hmm.

347
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:18,082
Scott: So maybe we should all right, so oh by the way Detroit's gonna is playing Green Bay on Thanksgiving.

348
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:19,645
Scott: so uh, yeah, they're gonna lose.

349
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:19,966
Scott: Yeah.

350
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:20,247
Rym: Yeah.

351
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:23,735
Rym: Okay, but they're gonna eat like a 13 legged turkey.

352
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:24,957
Scott: Yeah, maybe 1230 on Fox.

353
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:28,960
Rym: Right.

354
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:39,498
Rym: So, you know back in the day the internet was a collection of you know, 14 to 16 things Mm-hmm, and that was pretty much it.

355
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,829
Scott: Well, are you talking about the web or the Internet?

356
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,340
Scott: because the Internet was like well, you know what different things.

357
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,143
Rym: It's true for both because originally the Internet was a very small number of computers that could talk to each other That's true.

358
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,133
Rym: And then they added stuff to it.

359
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:53,420
Rym: And then there was the way I mean.

360
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,437
Rym: I guess we should really talk about what the web is.

361
00:25:56,518 --> 00:26:04,559
Rym: briefly I mean people always a lot of people use the web or the world wide web to be synonymous with the internet and that is Absolutely, not true.

362
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:11,200
Rym: The web is just if nothing else the easiest most obvious most well-known thing that the internet is used for.

363
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:13,828
Rym: The web came long after the internet.

364
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:15,172
Rym: the web was newfangled.

365
00:26:15,212 --> 00:26:16,596
Rym: for a long time the web evolved.

366
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,800
Rym: the web used to not have pictures.

367
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:26,628
Scott: Yep The internet is a bunch of computers connected to each other on a network and they can send data to each other in in many ways and They're they you can do.

368
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:29,180
Scott: you can have all sorts of different methods of sending data.

369
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,205
Scott: I mean I could connect from one computer to another computer with SSH.

370
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:33,908
Scott: I do it every day.

371
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:37,965
Scott: I can connect from one computer another computer with IRC protocol.

372
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:39,469
Scott: I don't do that very often at all.

373
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:39,729
Rym: Gopher!

374
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,932
Rym: I could use gopher.

375
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:41,815
Scott: You could use gopher.

376
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:42,877
Rym: I did use gopher.

377
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:46,786
Scott: You could use Telnet you could use shoutcast.

378
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,551
Scott: You can use all sorts of different protocols.

379
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,333
Rym: RSH.

380
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:55,259
Scott: Yeah all sorts of things and HTTP is just one of those things.

381
00:26:56,003 --> 00:27:05,976
Scott: However, HTTP which is the hypertext transfer protocol Which in my age is the web which basically will send usually HTML which is an SGML.

382
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:09,627
Scott: Yes HTML is hypertext markup language.

383
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:13,660
Scott: So HTTP is a transfer protocol for the transfer of HTML.

384
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:16,668
Scott: So basically the web is.

385
00:27:16,688 --> 00:27:27,780
Scott: there are servers and you go to the server and with HTTP There are pretty much three things that there used to be more things that you could do with HTTP like put.

386
00:27:28,364 --> 00:27:30,739
Scott: But nowadays all you can really do is get and post.

387
00:27:31,622 --> 00:27:33,399
Scott: Get says give me that page.

388
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:40,996
Scott: So you go to a web server and you say get and the web server And the web server sends you the HTML.

389
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:45,391
Scott: so when you type in google.com Your web browser sends packets to Google.

390
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:55,224
Scott: that says get and then Google sends you Google.com the front page in HTML format and then your browser goes get get get get get to get the pictures and then loads the Pictures and that's it.

391
00:27:55,927 --> 00:28:06,390
Rym: So and also the only other thing I really say is that www the acronym stands for the World Wide Web, but www.something does not mean you're on the web.

392
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:12,679
Rym: that www is the name of the computer that is called www that is at the rest of that URL.

393
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:20,631
Scott: Yeah, it just so happens that people often name computers with web servers running on them www because it kind of makes sense, don't you think?

394
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:22,700
Scott: Yeah, maybe so take that Godot.

395
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,380
Rym: Who wouldn't listen to me and argued with me on Gmail for a while about that and not the Phoenix Wright guy?

396
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:37,920
Rym: No, not the awesome guy Who's also awesome, but loses points for arguing with me about an IT issue when he's a juggler.

397
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:40,160
Rym: Also, why does he have time to argue with me?

398
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:46,170
Rym: I I was just some guy on the internet and yet he just kept responding because he makes his living Juggling at once a night.

399
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,720
Scott: He doesn't do anything all day.

400
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:54,395
Scott: He has time to bike the Tour de France on a stationary bicycle in his house.

401
00:28:55,177 --> 00:28:56,120
Rym: Oh, you know, I forgot about that.

402
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,482
Rym: Yeah.

403
00:28:56,763 --> 00:28:57,024
Rym: Oh, yeah.

404
00:28:57,044 --> 00:28:59,033
Rym: I remember Penn Jillette used to have a podcast.

405
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:00,037
Rym: It was kind of good.

406
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:03,639
Rym: Yeah Anyway, so forget all that the web.

407
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:05,932
Rym: How do you find stuff on the web?

408
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:11,700
Rym: I mean back in the day You could go to the bookstore and this was before I even had access to the internet.

409
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:20,194
Rym: This is back when I had prodigy but there was an internet that I theoretically could have gotten to though I didn't know how you could buy yellow pages of the internet that pretty.

410
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:24,579
Rym: they were in the bookstore and they had Pretty much every website in the world.

411
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:36,240
Scott: Yeah I mean there weren't that many of them only so many people had the ability to set up a web sir and the knowledge to Set up a working web server get it connected and keep it running properly you might say in the world.

412
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:38,160
Rym: What about the rest of the world outside of the US?

413
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,860
Rym: There really was no internet to speak of at least not like it is today.

414
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,952
Scott: Was made in the US and it's still.

415
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:47,779
Scott: most of it is in the u.s.

416
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:48,000
Scott: U.s.

417
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:49,435
Scott: Now it's spread out.

418
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,303
Rym: the u.s Invented it.

419
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:50,706
Rym: the u.s.

420
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:52,538
Rym: Has the majority of its infrastructure.

421
00:29:52,578 --> 00:29:56,994
Rym: the u.s Has the majority of the control over it and I don't see that changing anytime soon.

422
00:29:57,335 --> 00:29:59,294
Rym: No, not really but back then I mean it was just.

423
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:06,842
Rym: There were very few things that weren't just websites in English and you could go buy a book and you could search for Games.

424
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:12,900
Rym: and under games you find like six URLs and they were all there and they didn't change.

425
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:16,540
Scott: Yep, cuz I mean people who did set up a web server.

426
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,587
Scott: I mean there wasn't that much advanced stuff you could do.

427
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,277
Scott: you could pretty much set up static pages that didn't change.

428
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:30,394
Scott: not like you Know you go to Amazon you can reload the page and it's different because it's a computer is automatically Generating that HTML based on data in a database and other information.

429
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:32,260
Scott: They didn't have that technology originally.

430
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:34,880
Scott: It was just someone made a web page and put it there.

431
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,931
Scott: so it was basically like that would be.

432
00:30:36,972 --> 00:30:44,496
Scott: it was easily the same as Downloading a Word document and reading it and that Word document never changed unless someone manually changed it with their hands.

433
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,465
Rym: and remember in the early Web, there weren't pictures There was nothing here.

434
00:30:50,485 --> 00:30:54,894
Scott: You were lucky if you had colors let alone pictures and of course escape 2.0 gold.

435
00:30:54,914 --> 00:31:03,382
Rym: I Don't know if this is gonna turn to an ossiligist fest for blink tags and and Java's.

436
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:11,633
Rym: remember those early like chat boards that were in a website that just Basically, we're a web page that refreshed every 10 seconds with what everyone had posted.

437
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:12,997
Rym: Yeah, and then crashed.

438
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:17,139
Rym: Yeah I used to hang out in those things all the time.

439
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:17,903
Rym: Geoshitties.

440
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:22,405
Rym: All right, but I had a Geocities site, but based on me to stuff at least realm It was a ROM site.

441
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:23,992
Scott: I was in Times Square Castle.

442
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:29,733
Rym: I was in Times Square dungeon Mm far 8716 I don't remember.

443
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:35,680
Scott: but anyway The point is is that there were web servers and you needed to know the URL of the web server.

444
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:40,850
Scott: And if the web server had multiple pages You needed to know the URL of those pages and it was.

445
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:45,327
Scott: there was no way to find this out and mean less someone told You or how would you know?

446
00:31:45,347 --> 00:31:48,340
Scott: How would you know the URL of something?

447
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,668
Rym: I mean, so, you know how people got around the internet.

448
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:56,871
Rym: there was there's a term that was used in the 90s And it's pretty much ceased to exist.

449
00:31:56,911 --> 00:31:59,060
Rym: It is not a thing that people do anymore.

450
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,684
Rym: It's kind of this archaic terminology.

451
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,349
Rym: You didn't just use the internet.

452
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,200
Rym: people used to surf the web which been very specifically Go to a website.

453
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:11,506
Rym: every website had a links page because that's how the internet was.

454
00:32:12,127 --> 00:32:15,388
Rym: and after you know, I'm looking at this web page and I'm bored with it.

455
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:15,933
Rym: I'm done with it.

456
00:32:15,993 --> 00:32:16,377
Rym: I read it.

457
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:18,386
Rym: What now internet like?

458
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:27,160
Rym: click on links and it was usually a collection of things that were either related or Things that the person who made that web page thought himself or herself were interesting.

459
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:38,087
Rym: So I'd go Oh bunnies I click on that and I'd read this page about bunnies for an hour and then I'd look down and say huh a link to a site on Military something something that sounds interesting.

460
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:41,497
Rym: click and you just go website to website in a line.

461
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:42,380
Rym: There were no tabs.

462
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:52,217
Rym: you could open multiple windows, but Good luck with that with your 16 megabytes of RAM About three windows before it crashed if your dialogue didn't go first.

463
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:56,569
Scott: Yep In addition to that people eventually made web rings.

464
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:58,314
Scott: now what a web ring was?

465
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:00,280
Rym: is you a collection of broken links?

466
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,320
Scott: Basically, you would let's say I was I made a website about video games.

467
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:17,760
Scott: I would go and I would find a web ring for video game websites and I would paste this code on my website and That so on my website to be this giant block of HTML like this big table and it would say video game web ring.

468
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:18,389
Scott: click here.

469
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:30,080
Scott: and basically, what it would do is Everyone else who joined that web ring would have this web ring thing on their site and you would click next on the web ring And we take you to the next site in the ring.

470
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:35,060
Rym: Yep Next previous or random or you can look at the list but the list never worked on any of those stupid things.

471
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:48,567
Scott: yeah, most of the sites were broken, but you could go around and go to every website of People who had joined this particular web ring and the idea was that hey if our sites are similar We all put this thing on our site.

472
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:51,680
Scott: anyone who comes to any one of our sites will go to all of our sites.

473
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:53,532
Scott: But I keep clicking next next next next next.

474
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,252
Scott: I Put web rings on my old Geo city site for a while.

475
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:58,800
Scott: I never went through a web ring.

476
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:03,120
Rym: I went through web rings all the time partly because I wanted to find out stuff about anime.

477
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:14,231
Rym: So I went on all these anime web rings and I download picture galleries that I didn't do the anime until I find like a MIDI File of the opening theme to Tenchi and that was hot shit.

478
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:18,672
Scott: Yep now also in this day Eventually there came like there was.

479
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,040
Scott: what was that called link exchange?

480
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,049
Scott: Oh, yeah exchange was basically like the beginning of banner ads.

481
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:28,826
Scott: what you did is you went to link exchange and you made a banner in MS Paint or whatever.

482
00:34:29,088 --> 00:34:39,960
Scott: you uploaded it and you put your URL in there and Then you would put this link exchange thing on your site and whenever anyone visited your site It would randomly select an image to show in the link exchange banner.

483
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:57,475
Scott: It would be a random banner and the ideal was if you allowed a random banner to show up on your site every time someone visited then your banner would randomly show up on other people's websites and Hopefully someone would clink on the click on that random banner and end up at some other websites

484
00:34:57,635 --> 00:34:59,360
Rym: or they'd clink after the modem died.

485
00:34:59,484 --> 00:35:09,100
Scott: But yes but basically the point was There were people were trying to get more links to URLs on the web because it was impossible to find anything any other way.

486
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:10,509
Rym: Now I do want to point out something.

487
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,040
Rym: I don't want to go into detail about this.

488
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:18,459
Rym: this is obviously a topic for another show, but Notice how nothing we've said generates revenue for jack all anyone.

489
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:22,131
Rym: yet Not so much talk about ads or anything like that.

490
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:22,994
Scott: Look the only.

491
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:24,258
Scott: where's some ads going on?

492
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:24,479
Rym: many.

493
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:33,374
Rym: But look the only thing we're talking about here that was close to an ad was this kind of open Free thing that people mutually used to try to help each other out.

494
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:34,920
Rym: No one made money off of that.

495
00:35:35,362 --> 00:35:37,093
Scott: I think you could pay the link exchange.

496
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:45,820
Rym: eventually at one point It all became about money but much of the web was pretty much just people posting interesting things and linking to other interesting things.

497
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:47,188
Rym: There weren't pop-ups yet.

498
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:48,697
Scott: No, not yet.

499
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:49,240
Scott: Not yet.

500
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,679
Rym: Anyway, no one had even thought what if I made a pop-up?

501
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,122
Scott: I wasn't.

502
00:35:52,142 --> 00:35:54,599
Scott: it's like an escape three or four that says stuff was going on.

503
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,994
Rym: Those were dark times because there's no way out.

504
00:35:57,014 --> 00:35:59,440
Rym: Yeah There's popovers.

505
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:10,780
Scott: so the next thing that happened was Yahoo came about and Yahoo was a big deal because Yahoo was one website that you could go to And they had so many links to other websites and most of them were good and not broken.

506
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:11,984
Scott: It was amazing.

507
00:36:12,064 --> 00:36:18,643
Scott: and the way Yahoo worked originally was you would submit a website to Yahoo with a description And everything.

508
00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:31,420
Scott: you had to fill out this form and people at Yahoo would manually look at that site Decide if it was good enough to be on Yahoo and if it was they would add it to Yahoo in the appropriate category.

509
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:35,865
Scott: So when you're looking for gaming sites Gaming area on.

510
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:41,969
Scott: Yahoo had like 50 links to different gaming websites and that was a big deal Especially when like new links showed up there you'd be like all man's.

511
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:45,080
Rym: so up and the internet started getting bigger.

512
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:46,510
Rym: There were more things around.

513
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,759
Rym: things started changing moving.

514
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,331
Rym: Suddenly pretty much every link on Yahoo was broken Yeah, and and new sites appeared far faster than they could keep up.

515
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:56,875
Rym: Yahoo became nothing.

516
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,435
Rym: it just became so useless pretty much.

517
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:06,506
Scott: It was like for a time you would use Yahoo and then after a while you would go there to be nothing new for you at all.

518
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:13,039
Rym: and You just like oh, but at the same time it didn't matter that much because internet culture was different.

519
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:17,719
Rym: back then I would have a list of like 20 or 30 sites that I hung out at.

520
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:19,827
Rym: Those were the sites that I went back to.

521
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:22,255
Rym: I went to websites on purpose now.

522
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:23,760
Rym: I just go to content aggregators.

523
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:28,420
Scott: Yep, all right, so then there was stuff like Alta Vista and web.

524
00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:31,229
Rym: Really fuzzy about the chronology because you don't care.

525
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:35,367
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure we're saying things chronologically out of order But that doesn't really matter.

526
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:41,188
Rym: Well, what I'm saying is that there was kind of then this Power vacuum where suddenly there's no real.

527
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:44,860
Rym: I mean you could use this Lycos thing which searched the internet in one way.

528
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:53,467
Rym: I think their claim to fame was that we have more pages index than anyone else because we did by it was it was all About the number of pages you had.

529
00:37:53,547 --> 00:38:12,980
Scott: right because there were certain numbers of pages on the internet and the way people were making these Search engines that the primitive search engines was with crawlers and the crawler would visit one website Then visit every website that that website linked to and so on and so forth and it would keep track of every website It could see and try to make a giant database of every website.

530
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,680
Scott: There was so that way, you know the more sites they had in their search engine because there weren't so many sites.

531
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:26,000
Scott: I mean there was a lot of sites thousands upon thousands and thousands But there weren't so many that there would be something about everything, you know.

532
00:38:26,361 --> 00:38:35,020
Scott: So that the idea was that the more sites we have indexed if you search for something You're likely to find what you're looking for with our search engine because we have more sites in day.

533
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:44,091
Rym: However, you couldn't find dick and the reason was computers weren't that fast back then and search algorithms weren't all great back then And no one had been done anything really clever.

534
00:38:44,776 --> 00:38:53,080
Rym: So most search I mean, how does a website that's gonna search determine whether or not this site about kittens or this site about kittens is better?

535
00:38:53,780 --> 00:39:00,234
Rym: The only metric most people could come up with back Then was the number of times the word kittens appeared on the website and

536
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:07,080
Scott: people are doing things like they would say All right Everyone put these meta tags at the top of your page with the keywords that you want to be known for.

537
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,709
Rym: So then other sites would weight those things really highly.

538
00:39:09,749 --> 00:39:16,977
Rym: like if I make a video game ROM site my meta tags were video games ROMs illegal where's?

539
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:28,399
Scott: Yeah, and literally in those days you could make a website right and at the top of the website you could be like meta space Keywords equals video games video games video games video games video games video games video games, etc.

540
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:30,046
Scott: Like a hundred times.

541
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:35,948
Rym: and then do slash meta and then at the bottom your website You got a white background in white text.

542
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:43,371
Scott: You have the word video games a million times Yep, and basically now any sir almost a bunch of search engines.

543
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:48,044
Scott: if someone typed in video games your site would be on top And that was how it worked.

544
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:58,375
Rym: and right about then is also when ad sites started really springing up and there was the whole Dark age of advertising on the internet that we could probably do a separate show about.

545
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:04,688
Scott: probably let's not talk about the advertiser no, let's talk about the searching right and The search engines were largely useless.

546
00:40:04,748 --> 00:40:11,920
Scott: and the worst thing about the search engines was that you would search for something and even if it Looked like a good link showed up link would be broken.

547
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:15,415
Scott: It would just be you click and it would take you nowhere before or for.

548
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:17,282
Rym: search engines were not Intelligent.

549
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:24,216
Rym: if you type cats and the best cat site in the world had cats in it But never said the word cat you're not gonna find it.

550
00:40:24,517 --> 00:40:27,800
Rym: Nope, and Also, you really had to know your logic.

551
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,536
Rym: A lot of people didn't realize that you know you this and this or this.

552
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:32,400
Rym: you had to really.

553
00:40:32,922 --> 00:40:38,673
Rym: It was kind of an art and a science to craft a search that would find what you want What you wanted.

554
00:40:38,693 --> 00:40:39,359
Rym: you would never find it.

555
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,934
Scott: Yeah The way you searched was a lot like the way you searched on the original CD-ROM encyclopedias.

556
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:49,419
Scott: you had to say I want websites that have cats not pets.

557
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:53,929
Scott: Yes Eating and try to find out like what wild like.

558
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,872
Scott: I don't know why.

559
00:40:55,313 --> 00:40:57,018
Scott: maybe if you're trying to find out like what what?

560
00:40:58,881 --> 00:41:02,731
Scott: cats eat as opposed to what pet cats eat something like that.

561
00:41:03,072 --> 00:41:11,557
Rym: and of course in addition to all that this was right about the era where a Good quarter of the time any link you clicked on was actually pornography.

562
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:20,438
Rym: unexpectedly All sorts of crazy porn out there and it was low-resolution Pornography - but porn would just pop up all the time no matter where you went.

563
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:28,140
Rym: Yeah Like whenever I searched I had a club text thing open and anytime I search I type my search terms.

564
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:40,900
Rym: They're like plus kittens plus kibble and then I'd paste Minus sex minus porn minus xxxx minus hot girls minus a million things to try and see a little bit less porn.

565
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,465
Rym: Well, I searched for kittens and kibble.

566
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:51,040
Rym: Yeah, that was how it was and all the way all the searches were kind of Eventually, I think Alta Vista was probably the best one.

567
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,301
Rym: I don't

568
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:58,199
Scott: know that but like you'd come up with a search and you would try it at all the different search engines because they'd All give you completely different results and maybe you'd get lucky

569
00:41:58,982 --> 00:42:15,140
Rym: And even then you'd have to dig down you'd pretty much assumed that the top four pages were useless and I'd be going to like the 80th page of links and Lycos and Yeah, and Alta Vista was pretty much the best of them and all the I guess geeky smart people tended to use Alta Vista.

570
00:42:15,682 --> 00:42:18,731
Rym: Failing that they use Yahoo pretty much or Lycos.

571
00:42:18,752 --> 00:42:21,300
Rym: the Lycos turned into a porn crawler web crawler.

572
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,439
Scott: There was hot spot that right.

573
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:24,985
Scott: There's all kinds of stuff.

574
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:33,788
Rym: and then people made things like I think dogpile is the one people knew best where all it did was Submit your search to all the search engines I thought and it would search through those results.

575
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:35,655
Scott: a dogpile is still around and there are many.

576
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:36,036
Scott: there were.

577
00:42:36,076 --> 00:42:38,258
Scott: there were many sites like dogpile back in the day.

578
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:44,479
Scott: So then eventually right Yahoo started getting a lot more users and it was actually they.

579
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:46,699
Scott: you know They stopped doing the directory and it started doing search.

580
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:51,422
Rym: Well, they still had the directory to decide the directory for a while But they remote.

581
00:42:51,463 --> 00:42:52,205
Scott: they were doing search.

582
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:54,654
Scott: now real search and at first I think they'd had.

583
00:42:54,694 --> 00:42:58,469
Scott: the search was powered by the hotspot But later you would go to the bot.

584
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:01,060
Scott: you would search on Yahoo because it was pretty much became the best.

585
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:07,371
Scott: He would scroll to the bottom and it would say Yahoo powered by Google and I was you know You'd see that down there.

586
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:12,520
Scott: You'd be like, okay There's some people named Google that are making Yahoo work and eventually people figured it out.

587
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:20,700
Scott: They clicked on that word Google down there and it took him to Google and the internet was never the same not ever again.

588
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,100
Scott: basically, Google was Always the same as it is now pretty much in terms of the search engine.

589
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:31,757
Scott: It was a text box and a button with no shit in the way.

590
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:34,955
Scott: pretty much I didn't what you wanted and you got what you want.

591
00:43:35,036 --> 00:43:35,599
Rym: anyone who?

592
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,207
Rym: Went to Google and search for something.

593
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:41,240
Rym: pretty much never used another search engine again.

594
00:43:41,814 --> 00:43:46,377
Scott: Yeah I mean you typed in what you want and there was the best thing in the world right at the top every time.

595
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:51,300
Rym: and I Think we'll end on that that and think of this as part one of a fair.

596
00:43:51,823 --> 00:43:54,179
Scott: You want to talk a little bit about why Google was that way?

597
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,042
Rym: I don't know.

598
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,080
Rym: I kind of want to save that for the show about Google.

599
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,627
Rym: Just talk about Google for the whole show.

600
00:43:58,647 --> 00:44:02,623
Rym: All right, you know why it's good why it's still good Why it was good.

00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:16,900
Scott: and I have to study my Wikipedia.

608
00:44:20,972 --> 00:44:28,400
