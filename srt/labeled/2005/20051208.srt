00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,773
Rym: It's Tuesday December 8th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:14,519
Rym: We talked about our freshman year in college.

3
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:16,538
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:20,190
Rym: So today was another awesomely boring day.

5
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:20,912
Scott: God.

6
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:30,841
Scott: It was just like yesterday where I had nothing to do at work only I didn't go to the comic book store after work, and I was just God.

7
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:37,360
Rym: yeah, I work late to diagnose a silly problem with a switch that I probably shouldn't had to stay late to diagnose.

8
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:39,688
Rym: Wow it was awesome.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,960
Scott: I was sitting there doing nothing and I really don't want to go tomorrow cuz I'm not gonna do anything tomorrow.

10
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:47,487
Rym: Oh, you might not have to go do anything.

11
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:49,496
Rym: tomorrow looks like it's gonna snow a lot.

12
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:56,731
Scott: if it snows enough I'm just gonna be like fuck it, and I'll stay home, and I'll do something cool And maybe I'll just call in sick.

13
00:00:57,053 --> 00:00:57,799
Rym: I need a day off.

14
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,236
Rym: I'm actually really dragging from not sleeping enough the last two weeks.

15
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:08,080
Scott: oh, man You know I can't sleep on the trains so easily cuz I have a thing where I need to lay down.

16
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:12,599
Scott: That's kind of weird, but I was so tired on the way home on the train.

17
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:16,776
Scott: I was playing Mario and Luigi and like my eyes.

18
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:20,680
Scott: I couldn't hold them open While I was playing a DS game.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,919
Rym: Why don't you get one of those like neck pillows that goes around your neck because they look silly they work.

20
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:27,246
Scott: Yeah, I might get one.

21
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:29,698
Scott: actually I just had to find one that I think is good.

22
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:35,179
Rym: so uh Neopets is Scientology.

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,464
Scott: Didn't see that coming.

24
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:41,456
Rym: Yeah sky was sitting at work today, and Scott sent me a link to this article.

25
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:48,060
Rym: It's about Neopets and He's like Neopets of Scientology, so I start reading the article and it just talks about Neopets.

26
00:01:48,725 --> 00:02:01,880
Rym: and then on the second page is there's one sentence and the sentence pretty much says the CEO of Neopets Doug Doring or Doring is Super super super super Scientologist, and he runs the company on the principles of Scientology.

27
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:06,533
Scott: Yeah, you mean there's a lot of people who are just oh, they're a Scientologist like.

28
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,740
Scott: I think the voice of Bart Simpson is a Scientologist.

29
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:26,300
Scott: Right Isaac Hayes supposedly Isaac Hayes a Scientologist, but you know while that makes you an idiot It doesn't necessarily mean the work you do is bad, so it doesn't really reflect on Neopets, but this guy runs the company with the teachings of L Ron Hubbard.

30
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:39,840
Rym: Quote here Hubbard's companies follow a system of departmental organization called the org board Which he claimed was a refinement of one used by an old galactic civilization that lasted 80 trillion years.

31
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:51,139
Scott: Imagine if you were the CEO of a company, and you said I think we should reorganize the company this way because aliens From an ancient time did it this way?

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,980
Scott: Yeah, oh right.

33
00:02:55,083 --> 00:03:08,746
Rym: What's even more interesting is that the primary Aspect of this org method of running a company involves having a corrections division that disciplines other divisions of the company and It says no more than that.

34
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:11,079
Scott: You know some companies kind of need that.

35
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:22,546
Rym: But at the same time yeah Yeah, so yeah, this may sound silly or like we're making it up, but no Scientology really is.

36
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:25,760
Rym: they're like hardcore behind the scenes at Neopets.

37
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:27,827
Scott: Yep, there was another guy who worked at.

38
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:30,236
Scott: Neopets is like an artist for a short time.

39
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:31,420
Rym: He got the fuck out of there.

40
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:36,202
Scott: He was smart, and he didn't Scientology, but he pointed out that yeah There's.

41
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:40,580
Scott: you know that Neil the Scientology doesn't get into the Neopets.

42
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:46,860
Scott: So if you're using Neopets you know I would I would encourage you to stop because you're supporting the Scientologists.

43
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:51,540
Scott: But at the same time Neopets isn't gonna turn you into a Scientologist anytime soon.

44
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:53,948
Scott: Yeah, which is it at least okay?

45
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:54,810
Scott: That's that's good.

46
00:03:54,831 --> 00:04:02,475
Scott: They didn't do that because if Neopets was a Scientology recruitment Well, you know we just have a freaking cow, but yeah, not like a Narcan.

47
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:13,520
Scott: on yeah, but Basically he worked there And he noticed that everyone above a certain level of management basically had to join Scientology and be hardcore.

48
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:20,139
Rym: And I'm sure most of you know our opinions on Scientology, and I don't we're not it's not an opinion.

49
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,400
Rym: well No, I'm talking about our specific opinions on Scientology, but there's also some facts, and I'm sure you guys know most of them.

50
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,239
Rym: But just very quickly Scientologists believe in an alien named Xenu who dropped atomic bombs on earth billions of years ago.

51
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:39,880
Scott: Yeah, and they think these little magic guys who stick to you and called body thetans, and you have to get them off of you.

52
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:46,599
Scott: Yeah, they're like all inside you imagine if some guy wrote a pulp sci-fi story And you believed it was the history of the world.

53
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,565
Scott: That's what Scientology is.

54
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:49,649
Rym: yeah pretty much.

55
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:51,475
Scott: That's not even like a joke.

56
00:04:51,516 --> 00:04:52,700
Scott: We're just dead serious.

57
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:57,297
Scott: This is really a cult that believes that and if you join them they take all your money.

58
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,200
Rym: pretty much.

59
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:59,953
Rym: They take it all bit by bit not all at once.

60
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:02,452
Scott: yep That's all there is to it.

61
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:09,019
Rym: Though apparently you get superpowers if you become a Scientologist and go all the way or you believe you have superpowers.

62
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:16,117
Scott: Yeah Tom Cruise, yeah, yeah, I don't see you saving people's lives Alright, so shove it.

63
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:26,116
Rym: Actually the weirdest thing is it seems like a lot of people have pointed out that a lot of Scientologists despite all their magic powers and disdaining you know things that can harm the body.

64
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:27,480
Rym: a lot of them are smokers.

65
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,364
Scott: Really, there's just clouds.

66
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:34,118
Rym: apparently there's clouds and clouds of them standing outside the Scientology building in New York City smoking every day.

67
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,366
Rym: hmm Just a little tidbit.

68
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:36,808
Rym: I picked up.

69
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,874
Scott: Oh they have a building.

70
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:38,860
Rym: Yeah, they have a building.

71
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:44,139
Scott: We should go and like we can't get in we could do stuff in front of it.

72
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:45,727
Rym: What just stand there?

73
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:47,899
Scott: We can make a wall of non culties.

74
00:05:49,582 --> 00:06:01,171
Rym: Why don't we just continue to do what we've been doing which is heckle and harass them whenever they're set up in the subways trying to convert people Because that won't draw as much iron.

75
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:02,276
Rym: It's fun though.

76
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:13,499
Rym: one time I mean every time we pass these guys in the subway We just stop and walk over and start telling people You know this is a cult right these guys are just trying to get you to join their crazy cult that believes in aliens because

77
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,469
Scott: that's what they are trying to do and

78
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:17,306
Rym: They really don't know how to deal with that.

79
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:24,390
Rym: one time they threatened to call the police on us, and we were like all right Fine call the police officer explain to him what you just said to us.

80
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:27,260
Scott: Yeah, they would have been hilarious if a cop came.

81
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,285
Scott: I would have been like these guys are cultists.

82
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:38,317
Scott: all I'm doing is telling people in the area using freedom of speech that they are cultists and They're calling the police saying we're harassing them.

83
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:45,500
Scott: Here is proof to their cultists, and the only way that wouldn't work is if the cop was a Scientologist.

84
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:49,206
Scott: Yeah, that would have not worked.

85
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:50,971
Rym: Oh, and they like to sue people.

86
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,583
Rym: so maybe we'll get sued after this but uh Awesome.

87
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,510
Rym: I would love to get sued by Scientology.

88
00:06:56,771 --> 00:07:12,160
Rym: Yeah way to give me some publicity Such That would rock Alright, so remember that story We did not long ago about the guy who tried to buy a camera and the company was evil and they tried to screw him.

89
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:25,306
Scott: Yep, well Someone else told that guy a story about a similar experience at another place that's also in Brooklyn named Wawa digital and Basically he had the same story.

90
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,733
Scott: He wanted to buy a camera.

91
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:27,938
Scott: He bought it on the.

92
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,248
Scott: you know It was a good price.

93
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:31,292
Scott: He called up.

94
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:33,340
Scott: They tried to sell him all these accessories.

95
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:36,510
Scott: He says and they say you know I get you know.

96
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,554
Scott: and he says fine.

97
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:39,440
Scott: I want to cancel mom canceling my order.

98
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,600
Scott: The guy's like are you really gonna do that and pay the restocking fee?

99
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,020
Scott: He's like I'm not paying any restocking fee because there wasn't any order and this guy got really pissed off.

100
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:58,180
Scott: I Guess they have big commissions Or I don't know why these salesmen keep getting pissed off that their scam business model doesn't work on smart people.

101
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:05,300
Scott: But he got really pissed off and he left the guy a voicemail saying he was gonna break his neck.

102
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:09,452
Rym: Yeah, and fortunately we have the actual voicemail here.

103
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:40,390
Rym: Yep, so let's roll that sucker 9 to receive at 3.22 p.m Yes, you're in a big trouble.

104
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:54,740
Rym: To erase press... Yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be no legal repercussions of that voicemail.

105
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,550
Rym: Yeah, you know threatening physical harm.

106
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,160
Scott: I don't think anything else needs to be said after hearing that.

107
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:08,639
Rym: Yeah, so I guess the moral is don't buy cameras that seem like they're too good a deal to be true from shady vendors in New York City.

108
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:12,152
Scott: Yeah, basically don't buy a camera from any small place in New York City.

109
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:19,440
Scott: buy your cameras from like I don't know The company that makes them or yeah a real store or even Best Buy.

110
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:24,944
Rym: I mean Best Buy is evil in a lot of ways, but they don't directly Steal from you.

111
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:25,025
Rym: Yep.

112
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:28,975
Rym: They they kind of like indirectly steal which is I guess better.

113
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:33,284
Scott: Hmm, I guess All right.

114
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,673
Rym: So also the MPAA.

115
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,957
Scott: Oh this story.

116
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:44,580
Scott: Okay, so the Someone made a movie called This film is not yet rated.

117
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:51,780
Scott: It's about the MPAA and how they rate films and it's about the impact of the film rating system on American culture.

118
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:56,700
Rym: And it paints the MPAA in a really bad light, of course because well, that's the truth.

119
00:09:57,002 --> 00:10:00,100
Scott: So any movie about the truth is gonna make the MPAA look bad.

120
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,784
Rym: So what did the MPAA rate it?

121
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:06,437
Scott: the MPAA gave a movie about movie ratings a rating of NC 17, huh?

122
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:17,129
Scott: Now there is the of course the conspiracy theory that says all they did that to keep it out of theaters and to keep it Out of blockbusters and no one will see it.

123
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,339
Scott: and blah blah blah blah blah, which is a very see.

124
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,885
Rym: I made it through my tinfoil hat.

125
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:30,732
Scott: It's probably partially true if not mostly true, but also The movie's got some Graphical sexual content in it.

126
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,265
Rym: So yeah But apparently they're.

127
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,713
Rym: they point out a lot of interesting things like.

128
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:46,295
Rym: it seems that the MPAA is much harsher on rating Homosexual sexuality than it is on heterosexual sexuality.

129
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:47,340
Scott: Oh, really?

130
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:50,230
Rym: So it seems like a movie where a man kisses.

131
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:54,627
Rym: a man is much more likely to get a hard rating Than a movie where a man kisses a woman.

132
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:55,570
Scott: Hmm.

133
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:57,095
Rym: Yeah fancy that.

134
00:10:57,577 --> 00:11:02,726
Rym: Oh, maybe these See the How these ratings are come about.

135
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:15,720
Rym: but basically the MPAA appoints a bunch of people to do it and they're anonymous And they watch the movie and they assign a rating based on what the average American family would think.

136
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:21,477
Rym: Oh great, at least that's their directive, but it's anonymous and there are really no repercussions and they can do things.

137
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:25,710
Rym: however they want Mm-hmm Supposedly it's anonymous to keep them from being bribed.

138
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:27,457
Rym: But I don't know.

139
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:29,490
Scott: Yeah I think they get bribed a little bit.

140
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:32,665
Rym: I I don't really know what to say.

141
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:33,989
Rym: The MPAA is bad.

142
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:37,759
Rym: They're on every front and I'd rather dislike them.

143
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:56,320
Scott: mmm-hmm be interesting to see Like if we could get a whole pile of movies from like different studios to independent and you know such and Compare like movies with similar content versus the rating they got and the years.

144
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:59,470
Scott: You know and see how things changed over time.

145
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,460
Rym: we could you know, actually it's gotten a lot more lenient over time.

146
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:05,700
Rym: Yeah, that's good except with regards to homosexuality.

147
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,213
Scott: Boys kissing Well, I can tell you one thing in Japan.

148
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:13,440
Scott: They don't give two craps.

149
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:19,999
Rym: Yeah in a lot of ways they seem a lot smarter than a lot of people here and in other ways a lot more nutty.

150
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:27,160
Rym: Yeah, yeah, that's fine, though Yeah Things of the day.

151
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:31,064
Rym: We don't have music yet Lazy bums.

152
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,353
Rym: Yeah, just haven't gotten around to it.

153
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:34,920
Scott: All right, so my thing today.

154
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:43,980
Scott: Well, you may recall Rym who had a great story that he seems to go crazy about and keeps referring to often.

155
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:45,051
Scott: Is that uh?

156
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,209
Scott: Most women never had the big O.

157
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,258
Rym: Well most American women American women.

158
00:12:51,823 --> 00:13:01,039
Scott: So someone made a piece of software called Lapis, it's a little rabbit L a P is and It doesn't actually run in the Nintendo DS.

159
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:35,999
Scott: it runs on the computer, but it you know has a little picture of a Nintendo DS because it has the same features of you know touchscreen and microphone and all that and it's kind of like Nintendogs except you have this cute little blue rabbit and You play with this cute little blue rabbit in various ways rubbing him with its stylus and blowing on the microphone and scratching and tickling and all that good stuff and the little rabbit is supposedly stimulated in the same way that a clitoris is.

160
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:48,387
Scott: so if you want to learn how to stimulate women You just stimulate the bunny until it flies around and yeah That's really the analogy to orgasm in the game.

161
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:49,851
Rym: The bunny starts flying.

162
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:55,602
Scott: Yep, and then you've got it supposedly Fantastic.

163
00:13:55,943 --> 00:14:00,576
Scott: So if you think your woman is faking the big O you can play the lapis.

164
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:11,877
Scott: if you're a woman And you don't know if you've ever had one you can practice lapis and then Go and do it to yourself later.

165
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:21,253
Scott: I'd like to hear someone who like, you know tried it and Determine if it was accurate or something.

166
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:22,299
Scott: That'll be cool.

167
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,310
Rym: Yeah We'll see.

168
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,271
Scott: Yeah, I Think I might just play this game just to have fun with the game.

169
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:31,114
Rym: Yeah.

170
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:32,640
Rym: Yeah, just to have fun.

171
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:34,992
Scott: And then look at some prawn.

172
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:36,380
Rym: Oh prawn prawn.

173
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:41,633
Rym: Yeah, my thing of the day is not nearly so cool, but I found it very cool until I heard about this thing.

174
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:51,510
Rym: Mmm, but uh Apparently recently very recently there was a semi major archaeological discovery in of all places Battery Park in New York City.

175
00:14:52,921 --> 00:15:01,053
Rym: Those of you who don't live out here Battery Park is the park at the bottom of Manhattan where you know Statue of Liberty and all that stuff is they were digging in Battery Park.

176
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:02,940
Rym: Oh, yeah, the subway lines go under there.

177
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:06,020
Rym: Oh, all right, and they were extent they're extending a subway line.

178
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:15,797
Rym: They're just from subway work and they discovered buried along the shore Gun emplacement from before the Revolutionary War a gun emplacement.

179
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:16,720
Rym: a gun emplacement.

180
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:19,613
Rym: Wow, it was just very good guns in it.

181
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:24,615
Rym: So it has gone Paraffinalia in it and like the foundations for the gun.

182
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:32,160
Rym: That's pretty cool Yeah, and they were absolutely amazed that it sat there undisturbed for so many freaking years.

183
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:35,019
Scott: Well, it's made of rock and it's underground where no one's touching it.

184
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:43,850
Rym: Yeah so the subway workers about and the the city and MTA have actually agreed to Work around it and leave it there so that people can come in and study it.

185
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:45,294
Scott: That's a good idea.

186
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:47,439
Rym: Yeah, it's all there is to that.

187
00:15:48,402 --> 00:16:03,200
Scott: It's always nice to see because people don't realize that New York City like if you were here, let's see 300 years ago When New York City was actually just like an island Manhattan was just an island with nothing on it except maybe like some buildings.

188
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:06,719
Scott: But it was actually that the original dirt and trees and such.

189
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:13,176
Scott: The city we have now is like three or four levels of city above that.

190
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:14,979
Scott: Oh Really?

191
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:20,640
Scott: It's like, you know over time they built stuff then they built stuff and they built stuff and they built stuff.

192
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:23,308
Scott: It's like way up now.

193
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,192
Rym: Well, there's all.

194
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:26,160
Rym: there's lots of cool abandoned stuff.

195
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,860
Rym: There's abandoned subway stations and subway lines and all like basements steam tunnels.

196
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:47,449
Scott: But if you look at say the first floor of an office building now That is like at the level that a roof of a house would have been in like the 17 or 1800s Mm-hmm because of the shit they've piled on Over time.

197
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:48,436
Scott: at least that's what I hear.

198
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:56,040
Scott: Aha, but of course you can see right here the gun emplacement which would normally be you know on land is underground.

199
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:57,910
Scott: So you see how that works out?

200
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,246
Rym: I Just thought it was very cool.

201
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,338
Rym: I'm glad that they're at least taking the time to study it.

202
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Rym: Yep, instead of just you know, running the six line or whatever subways over there through it.

203
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:12,797
Scott: Hey There's not you know, too much stuff left in New York City to study.

204
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:16,500
Rym: So What about the crazy homeless guys walking around yelling?

205
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,867
Scott: Those are crazy homeless guys.

206
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:20,619
Rym: You can study them see what they say.

207
00:17:21,784 --> 00:17:31,075
Rym: Hey All right, so basically for our main bid we were tired.

208
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:32,620
Rym: we didn't have much to talk about today.

209
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:36,833
Rym: So we figured we'd regale you with stories from our freshman year at RIT.

210
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:42,695
Rym: It's a geek fable Except there's no moral to this one other than have fun in college.

211
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:44,483
Scott: Well, I'm gonna make up a moral All right.

212
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:45,850
Rym: We'll see if you come up with one or not.

213
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,210
Rym: All right, I Mean, we're already told about how we all met.

214
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:56,675
Rym: Yeah, and You know some stories about our wag the gaming club and our dungeon master Dwayne We don't need to get into that.

215
00:17:56,938 --> 00:18:00,920
Rym: Nope But our life as freshmen in college was pretty fantastic.

216
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:08,160
Rym: RIT the dorms are connected to each other by a whole bunch of tunnels.

217
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:14,816
Scott: Yeah, of course I lived in Peterson and our tunnels weren't connected to the other tunnels until like a few quarters in.

218
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:15,477
Scott: yeah.

219
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:22,015
Rym: Yeah But I was in the good dorms So I could spend an entire weekend without even sitting one foot outside in the winter.

220
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:23,020
Scott: you were in the dorm.

221
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:25,628
Scott: That was all guys and vomitation.

222
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,980
Scott: I was in the co-ed dorm with no alcohol and no drugs.

223
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:35,320
Rym: Yeah, but your dorm was unrenovated and wasn't connected to the tunnel which means my route to which means my rooms were bigger.

224
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:39,127
Rym: Plus despite all the vomitation sis of my dorm.

225
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:40,852
Rym: No one ever vomited on me.

226
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:42,676
Scott: You vomited on you.

227
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:43,278
Scott: Yeah.

228
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,491
Rym: Yeah See, it's funny whenever I get the flu or anything I just like I vomit like.

229
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,580
Rym: that's my primary mode of fighting illness.

230
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:56,540
Rym: And one time when I was a freshman I got real sick and we all right here we have bunk beds.

231
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,044
Rym: Now this is kind of it.

232
00:18:58,084 --> 00:18:59,731
Rym: This is it's kind of a sick story.

233
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:04,226
Rym: Not that I guess we try told worse things But I'm laying there in bed.

234
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:10,700
Rym: I'm sick and I wake up in the middle of the night and then I vomit Bargo.

235
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:14,450
Rym: So I get out of bed and I'm not now.

236
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,895
Rym: my roommate who I never talked to.

237
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:16,176
Rym: I didn't.

238
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,160
Rym: I don't even know this kid's name.

239
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:18,426
Rym: I never talked to him.

240
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:19,371
Scott: I never knew his name.

241
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:20,235
Rym: He was quiet.

242
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:23,651
Rym: He wasn't interested anything I was interested in so we just never talked and we left each other alone.

243
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,520
Scott: He was sitting the chair wear headphones guy.

244
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:33,004
Rym: Yeah I am pretty certain that he awakened and decided to pretend he was asleep to avoid having to deal with what I would ride it Just done.

245
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,204
Scott: that is what I would do also being

246
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:50,140
Rym: basically the story ends with me putting all my dirty sheets in a hamper not having any more clean sheets taking a shower and then Feebly crawling into my like bare mattress covering myself with my last dry towel and trying to sleep.

247
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,089
Scott: That is hilarious.

248
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,280
Rym: I really don't miss living in dorms.

249
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:03,214
Rym: Now if I get sick, I have I have my own bedroom I have my own bathroom and I can just call in sick to work.

250
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:10,360
Scott: I'm glad I Don't vomit and my streak is is very very long of not vomiting.

251
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:15,755
Scott: I'll get some Ipecac and but I but I do diarrhea if I got a problem in the stomach.

252
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,887
Rym: the diarrhea as I am Well aware.

253
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:21,270
Scott: Yep But I'd rather diarrhea vomit.

254
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:23,359
Rym: I'm a hair trigger vomiter, but only what I'm sick.

255
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,650
Scott: See the diarrhea doesn't really bother me.

256
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:31,353
Scott: what bothers me is like the pain in the stomach I don't have like a bunch of gas like swelling up and hurting.

257
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:33,220
Scott: then it's all good with diarrhea.

258
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,939
Rym: So anyway, well get off of this tangent that you probably don't want to hear much about.

259
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:38,993
Scott: bowels.

260
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:40,329
Rym: Live in the dorms.

261
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,663
Scott: I'd like to buy a stick Aside from that.

262
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:49,766
Scott: Yep, basically because well you've got nothing to do You don't have to go outside.

263
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:50,970
Rym: We're a whole bunch of geeks.

264
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,431
Scott: You can?

265
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:58,017
Scott: you basically would spend entire weekends in Peterson not which was the dorm he was in.

266
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:03,219
Rym: Yeah, because this dorm had a lounge and this is the most fantastic lounge ever at least in terms of RIT.

267
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,453
Scott: Well in RIT now most of the lounges are freaking dorms.

268
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:08,039
Rym: Yeah, we'll get into that another time.

269
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:17,246
Rym: But this lounge had this hump like this thing in it and it was covered in the carpet and Basically, that was the Dungeon Master throne.

270
00:21:17,286 --> 00:21:20,275
Rym: whenever we played D&D Alex our Dungeon Master would sit up there.

271
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:21,700
Scott: It was perfect.

272
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,388
Rym: Yeah, you really had to have been there.

273
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:31,480
Rym: Mmm a lot of weekends We would just sit there and watch an entire anime like eska flown a or cowboy bebop just all in one go.

274
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:33,270
Scott: We actually met a lot of our friends.

275
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,820
Rym: that way we'd be what we were like one.

276
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,320
Rym: We were watching right her friend Laura who actually she writes for gamers with jobs now.

277
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:51,840
Rym: but we met her because we were watching tenku no eska flown a in marathon form and she walked by with some friends and saw it and Decided to sit there with us and watch the rest of it for the rest of the entire weekend.

278
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:57,740
Scott: See now if I turned on a marathon of I don't know try gun.

279
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,506
Scott: No one walks by here.

280
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:03,518
Scott: No one would stop by our house and decide to be our friend.

281
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:09,352
Rym: Yeah Yeah, they wouldn't see us crying because we all cried when we watched try gun.

282
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:15,968
Rym: Yeah, we were all standing in Scott's room actually in the unrenovated Peterson dorm.

283
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:27,959
Rym: all of us were standing around like eight people and we're watching a certain episode where a certain person has something bad happen to them as I avoid a spoiler and We're all crying and trying to hide the fact that we're crying from everyone else.

284
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:39,500
Scott: That was a weird time when we were watching that because it was it wasn't in my dorm room Yeah, and like I was sitting there and people were sitting on the floor and then people started showing up randomly.

285
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,988
Rym: Everyone was just standing there kind of crying.

286
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,754
Scott: Yeah, it was real weird.

287
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:45,380
Scott: I think my roommate was actually in the room.

288
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:49,260
Rym: I remember him giving us a look of like what the fuck he was a soccer guy.

289
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:52,779
Scott: That's all I remember about him as he was soccer guy.

290
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:57,700
Scott: He liked to play soccer and I think he transferred out because he didn't get on the RIT soccer team.

291
00:22:58,861 --> 00:22:59,404
Rym: See it's weird.

292
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,593
Rym: a lot of it seems like a lot of people who went to school.

293
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:09,199
Rym: they immediately at RIT At least they immediately become friends with their roommate and then they become friends with whatever like frat they join or whatever.

294
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:16,940
Rym: We were other than one special exception didn't even really know the names of our roommates and we just found friends and hung out with them.

295
00:23:17,622 --> 00:23:22,480
Scott: Yep, I mean, I remember like, you know, I saw you guys at our way, you know, we talked there.

296
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:32,560
Scott: But then I guess we all went to anime club a few times without seeing each other or noticing Yeah, but like I remember once I saw you in Gracie's and I just came up and I was like, oh those little guys

297
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,959
Rym: I remember thinking hey, it's that guy who was super Jew

298
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:36,990
Scott: Yeah and I went up and I said hey

299
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:38,379
Rym: and I was like hey and

300
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,892
Scott: Then I walked away because I didn't everything to say cuz they were just some guys.

301
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:48,519
Rym: Yeah, and that was you know It's weird to think I mean we're our whole group the front row crew and there's a lot of us.

302
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:53,197
Rym: We're like family and it's it's amazing to think that it wasn't that long ago that we'd never.

303
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:54,000
Rym: we didn't even know each other.

304
00:23:54,524 --> 00:24:02,664
Rym: Yep, everyone in the group was just that guy We met like Greg who we used to be really good friends with was just that cool fuzzy-haired guy who like came around every Now and then

305
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:07,433
Scott: yeah, he didn't Like I didn't even know he lives in the same floor as me until

306
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:07,896
Rym: yeah

307
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:08,680
Scott: a while.

308
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:18,377
Scott: Just I would recognize, you know his face in it like there's a lot of people I don't know their name But like I see them and I go I know you because I see your face and I recognize it.

309
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,599
Scott: and then you know Then Greg was one of those guys for like weeks and weeks and weeks.

310
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:29,337
Rym: Yeah, I remember we talked a lot about a counter-strike and funny otaku military stuff.

311
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:33,514
Rym: Mmm I remember cop katsu is a kendo guy.

312
00:24:33,654 --> 00:24:34,880
Rym: He's another member of the crew.

313
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,315
Scott: I actually met katsu before I met anyone else.

314
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:47,279
Scott: Wow like I went into our wag and I went and I was carrying my battle tech box and katsu was standing there with his funny umbrella and we said something about battle tech.

315
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,187
Scott: and Then Dwayne which you already discussed.

316
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,520
Scott: aha Dwayne, but and then I saw you other fools.

317
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,913
Scott: But yeah, it's all katsu before I saw anybody.

318
00:24:56,316 --> 00:24:56,577
Scott: Yeah.

319
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:59,228
Scott: Yeah, okay kind of weird.

320
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:04,534
Rym: I Remember one of the first people I actually met that I was doing anything with.

321
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:05,920
Rym: I was helping duck boy.

322
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:08,430
Rym: We won't get into why he's called duck boy quack quack.

323
00:25:08,911 --> 00:25:11,100
Rym: If he's listening you proud doesn't even know that we called him duck boy.

324
00:25:11,562 --> 00:25:13,950
Scott: Oh, I am the dog from the land of friends.

325
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:14,513
Rym: I don't know.

326
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:16,500
Rym: actually I really don't know why we called him duck boy.

327
00:25:17,042 --> 00:25:18,991
Scott: You will cook me in the French man.

328
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:20,880
Rym: Uh, why didn't we call him the Iron Chef?

329
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,195
Scott: I think someone else said he looked like a duck or something.

330
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:24,798
Rym: I don't know.

331
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:29,260
Rym: I don't know, but I was helping him make a third edition Dungeons & Dragons character.

332
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:30,844
Scott: He was a winner.

333
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:32,411
Rym: Yeah winner was him.

334
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:39,153
Rym: as in loser So many we I mean we just we had infinite free time.

335
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:40,279
Rym: none of us had jobs.

336
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,650
Rym: I Held a job for about two weeks and then I quit.

337
00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:45,540
Scott: I worked at Crossroads freshman year.

338
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:48,391
Rym: Yeah, I remember that it wasn't a bad gig.

339
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:54,799
Rym: I remember when Crossroads opened It was this cafe that they decided to make on the other side of campus that we rarely ventured to.

340
00:25:56,181 --> 00:26:09,249
Scott: Yeah, you didn't really need to go over there if you're a freshman because it was as far away from the dorms as possible And it was like the farthest away academic building, which you didn't really go to unless you had You know crazy crazy classes out there.

341
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,416
Scott: Yep, and freshman year.

342
00:26:11,456 --> 00:26:14,269
Scott: You don't really have crazy classes So they're mostly in the close buildings.

343
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,260
Rym: freshman year classes are pretty much nothing.

344
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,509
Rym: It was pretty much a non effort pass every class without even thinking.

345
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:27,820
Scott: Yeah, that's I mean freaking freshman year my first quarter I got like a freaking four I think or something crazy like some crazy-ass high GPA.

346
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:29,188
Rym: Yeah, we didn't do homework.

347
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:40,252
Rym: every day at around six o'clock We'd all congregated Gracie's the giant campus freshman cafeteria aka like pig trough Yep, and we started out like my.

348
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:42,000
Scott: I remember going to Gracie's in the early days.

349
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:50,411
Scott: I'd be alone and I didn't know there was takeout so I'd sit there alone Yeah, and then it was like two people and then like four people.

350
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:50,872
Scott: eventually

351
00:26:50,913 --> 00:26:53,880
Rym: we take up like an entire long table full of people

352
00:26:54,122 --> 00:27:03,067
Scott: And then an entire long table and a half Yeah, and then when we find out the people sucked we kicked them out of the table and we were back down to like You know a half a table God.

353
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:04,271
Rym: There was one guy.

354
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:06,580
Rym: I remember he was really big into hentai.

355
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,227
Rym: Yeah So much fans a hentai.

356
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:12,999
Scott: No, we're definitely the anti hentai fan.

357
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:20,371
Rym: now I don't mind if you like hentai, but I don't want you to tell me about it graphically constantly Yeah, especially if I didn't bring it up.

358
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:24,666
Scott: and I mean like don't Get your hentai on me.

359
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,153
Rym: Yeah, just keep it to yourself.

360
00:27:26,193 --> 00:27:27,619
Rym: get it on people who want to get it on them.

361
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:28,247
Scott: I mean like.

362
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:35,700
Scott: I don't even mind Being friends with someone who's like wacky religious or anything wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man.

363
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:40,745
Scott: Just don't get your religion on me But this guy keep it to yourself.

364
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:41,989
Scott: No, I'm gonna pester you.

365
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:47,553
Rym: luckily hentai guy was real distinctive real ugly God, it's just painful.

366
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:53,620
Scott: even today I think he's actually lost weight But you see him at conventions now and then I'll point him out to you if you ever find me.

367
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,848
Scott: But you just look at them and you go.

368
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:57,414
Scott: damn that's an ugly guy.

369
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,120
Scott: Oh, I don't want to look at him anymore.

370
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:08,700
Rym: Our huge group would congregate in Gracie's and we'd be looking around Just to try to spot him and try to head it off and sit where he wouldn't see us.

371
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:12,554
Rym: It was hard to do when you're a group of like 11 people.

372
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:20,522
Scott: It worked a couple times Yeah, and we were often able to escape him like he'd show up and we leave and he couldn't leave because he had a plate Full of food.

373
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:24,158
Rym: Yeah, plus we had a nice filter of only one of us had a car.

374
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:36,460
Scott: So if we wanted to go anywhere or if we wanted to drop a bunch of people we just say oh Driving somewhere and we pick the people we wanted to keep get in the car drive a bit cover on back.

375
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:46,527
Scott: Yeah, we didn't ever actually do that but we we'd like to go to a diner with the people we wanted to keep and then and then we come back and Actually a couple of times though.

376
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:48,172
Rym: I can his car was great for that.

377
00:28:48,674 --> 00:28:57,999
Rym: But a couple of times we would honestly just Say like alright, we're all going to bed Let's go home and we'd all like go our separate ways and then reconvene an hour later somewhere else.

378
00:28:58,662 --> 00:29:00,129
Scott: I think we only did that a few times.

379
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,937
Rym: Yeah, but those were critical times.

380
00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:15,300
Scott: Yeah Usually what would happen is we would you know, you'd be somewhere like anime club or Gracie's or something And then we'd walk back to the dorms and then we'd stop outside the dorm and talk for like an hour.

381
00:29:15,641 --> 00:29:17,147
Scott: Yep, it's kind of crazy.

382
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:18,773
Rym: Yeah, I still think back to that.

383
00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:19,697
Rym: maybe freezing cold.

384
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:20,460
Rym: We'd be standing out.

385
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,664
Scott: It wasn't freezing cold yet.

386
00:29:21,684 --> 00:29:23,049
Rym: Yeah, but even it was cold.

387
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,672
Rym: We still did it.

388
00:29:23,712 --> 00:29:24,876
Rym: We stand in like a lobby.

389
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,384
Rym: No lobbies Yeah, but there was this.

390
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,430
Rym: there's the thing we called it the thing.

391
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:35,855
Rym: it was basically this big concrete thing That you could sit on or stand on.

392
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:36,879
Rym: I guess it was a sculpture.

393
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:41,247
Scott: imagine if it's like a Like a pyramid but it's got.

394
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:44,940
Scott: you know, the whole thing is a stair but the stairs like two feet high.

395
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,289
Scott: I don't know if that's a very good description or not.

396
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,454
Rym: I don't think it really matter.

397
00:29:48,474 --> 00:29:48,594
Rym: Okay.

398
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:48,876
Scott: Okay.

399
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:49,960
Scott: It looks like a diva hat.

400
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:52,304
Rym: Yeah, it does.

401
00:29:52,385 --> 00:29:55,419
Scott: it's a diva hat a giant concrete diva hat.

402
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:56,723
Rym: And it was weird.

403
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:59,231
Rym: it got to the point where we became those guys.

404
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:01,920
Rym: the guys were always hanging out at like this place.

405
00:30:02,664 --> 00:30:04,354
Scott: Yep, we were the cool guys.

406
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:05,380
Rym: We're those cool guys.

407
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,765
Rym: We're all just standing there and people walk by like I want to stand on the thing But I can't.

408
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,138
Rym: those guys are always there.

409
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,584
Scott: We're too cool for you.

410
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:15,899
Rym: if other people were there we'd walk over and we just kind of muscle our way in.

411
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:17,519
Rym: you know with our geek leave muscles.

412
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,667
Rym: No, we didn't well by muscle our way in.

413
00:30:20,707 --> 00:30:27,927
Rym: we just kind of stand around there and eventually the non geeks get uncomfortable and leave Suck or they'd be geeks and it'd be awesome.

414
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:28,529
Scott: Yep.

415
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:29,592
Scott: That's how you add people.

416
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:31,999
Rym: it helped that RIT is a real geeky school.

417
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:42,219
Scott: mmm, if you're a nerd or geek and You're looking for a school Even though RIT has its problems just like every other school.

418
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,031
Scott: There's no place geeky or you can go god damn.

419
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:47,296
Scott: You'll be freaking happy there.

420
00:30:47,397 --> 00:30:57,914
Rym: Let me tell you One of our favorite pastimes was we'd we'd wander around looking for places to Continue to hang out.

421
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:03,217
Rym: So we'd be hanging out somewhere and then we'd get restless, but we didn't have anything to do.

422
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:09,960
Rym: We had no money Yeah, so we'd start wandering around campus until we found like another room to hang out in.

423
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:12,439
Scott: Oh the tunnels are full of rooms.

424
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:15,851
Rym: Yeah The tunnels had a lot of old abandoned infrastructure like.

425
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:18,120
Rym: there used to be a dance club down there that they shut down.

426
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,239
Rym: There's just a big empty room.

427
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,585
Scott: There used to be an arcade.

428
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:24,719
Scott: that wasn't there anymore, but you can still see the painting on the wall that said arcade here.

429
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:29,597
Scott: Yep, and there was still like pieces of paper like arcade hours, but there was no arcade.

430
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,314
Scott: It was just a part.

431
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,738
Rym: We busted into conference rooms just to play battle tech.

432
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,150
Scott: Oh Battle tech you've eaten so many hours.

Rym: Yeah, and this campus safety guy comes over.

440
00:31:57,452 --> 00:31:58,720
Rym: He's like what the hell are you guys doing?

441
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,580
Scott: Well, the door was open and we just wanted to walk through because it was kind of cold outside.

442
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:06,480
Scott: Yeah, and this campus safety guy comes in and he's like, what are you doing in the building?

443
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,680
Scott: We're like, well the door was open.

444
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:12,160
Scott: So we walk through the building to you know Go in that door and come out the door on the other side.

445
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,810
Scott: So we'd be warm at least for that distance of the walk.

446
00:32:15,794 --> 00:32:20,758
Scott: and he's like, you know, the building's closed You can't be in here and we're like, oh But the door was open.

447
00:32:21,463 --> 00:32:27,007
Rym: Yeah, you know even though they often forget to lock doors and Actually, there were a lot of like.

448
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:28,755
Rym: basically there were secret ways in.

449
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:38,591
Rym: I don't know if they still work But there was basically a secret ways to get into any building on campus locked or not because of those tunnels Yep, but nowadays they lock the buildings much better.

450
00:32:38,712 --> 00:32:41,120
Scott: So yeah, you're not gonna get in quite as easily.

451
00:32:41,463 --> 00:32:42,108
Rym: It's actually sad.

452
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,580
Rym: all the campus changed when we were freshmen.

453
00:32:44,102 --> 00:32:48,217
Rym: The dorms were open until 11 all the time till 11 the doors was unlocked.

454
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,020
Rym: You could do whatever you want.

455
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,755
Scott: They gave me a key to open like the doors of the whole dorms.

456
00:32:52,835 --> 00:32:57,019
Rym: I never used that key Yeah, unless we left late at night and you had to get back in somehow.

457
00:32:57,722 --> 00:33:00,613
Scott: Even so I even late at night, but that door was always open.

458
00:33:00,794 --> 00:33:04,399
Scott: Yeah, cuz you walk into Gracie's and yeah No, I would just walk into my dorm.

459
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,396
Rym: My dorm was usually locked but I could get into the tunnels.

460
00:33:07,678 --> 00:33:10,840
Scott: nowadays I think they have like locks in the dorms then on the elevators.

461
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,953
Rym: And yeah nowadays in RIT if you're in a freshman in the dorms You gotta put your key in the elevator to use the frickin elevator.

462
00:33:17,074 --> 00:33:17,395
Scott: Wow.

463
00:33:17,757 --> 00:33:22,456
Rym: Yeah And we also had our.

464
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:25,746
Rym: we didn't do this that often but when we did it was most enjoyable.

465
00:33:26,228 --> 00:33:33,870
Rym: our zeppelin days It was sunny out because there are less sunny days in Rochester than there are in Seattle.

466
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:37,589
Scott: They're less sunny days in Rochester than there are women at RIT.

467
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:48,141
Rym: So our zeppelin days when it was warm enough out we'd lay on the quarter mile Which is like this path between the dorms and the academic side.

468
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:50,830
Scott: Well, it actually went through the academic side.

469
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:56,370
Rym: So yeah, let's say it connected them and then it continued through the academic and that was the extra quarter of mile.

470
00:33:56,811 --> 00:34:02,410
Rym: So we'd lay there with a boombox playing zeppelin shirtless just kind of sunbathing or tossing a ball around.

471
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:09,212
Rym: We're really the only ones who did something like that and a lot of people gave us weird looks but no one ever really said Anything to.

472
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:15,882
Scott: yeah, you had if you wanted to be out on the quarter mile, you had to have a frisbee or something You know, you couldn't just lay out there with music.

473
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:18,678
Scott: people would be like what the hell you're not working You know, what are you doing?

474
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:20,108
Scott: Yeah, what's going on?

475
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:24,629
Rym: I remember we'd see all those people like furiously studying and we just kind of laugh at him.

476
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,396
Scott: I never understood that.

477
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:29,789
Scott: I mean look I graduated I didn't furiously study ever.

478
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,389
Scott: What were they doing?

479
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,013
Scott: What were they doing?

480
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:34,542
Rym: What are you doing?

481
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:35,467
Rym: What are you doing?

482
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:40,833
Scott: Hey, dude Ah Freshman year was good.

483
00:34:41,376 --> 00:34:45,630
Rym: Yeah, I guess the moral here is don't squander your freshman year of college.

484
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:48,464
Rym: That's the most fun for the least responsibility.

485
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:49,447
Rym: You're ever gonna have.

486
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:54,909
Scott: I Think the moral is be one of the people who has diarrhea and not vomit when you get sick.

487
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:59,392
Scott: Cuz vomiting really sucks All right.

488
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,060
Rym: So well, we'll tell some more stories another time.

489
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:11,730
Rym: That was a very tiny slice of our life at RIT Mm-hmm, but to move into some meta bits this podcast was kind of blab because Scott's all tired and he won't really talk.

490
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:13,298
Scott: Hey, I did just.

491
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:14,404
Scott: you know, what do you want from me?

492
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:19,349
Scott: Don't be so tired okay, so You better.

493
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,015
Rym: Yeah, yeah, what what what?

494
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:22,737
Rym: what are you gonna say?

495
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,181
Rym: You're too tired even argue.

496
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:27,130
Scott: I've has blame on to you with some words.

497
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:31,757
Scott: Yeah anyway We got a little meta bit.

498
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:36,190
Scott: The first meta bit is that we're looking for Audio feedback.

499
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:44,634
Scott: Other podcasts have audio feedback where people call in or send, you know mp3s of themselves Saying something.

500
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:53,006
Scott: so and as opposed to sending us an email with feedback You record yourself saying the feedback and send it to us now.

501
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:53,870
Rym: How does this sound?

502
00:35:54,671 --> 00:35:58,576
Rym: We have a specific kind of feedback not really feedback But a specific thing.

503
00:35:58,596 --> 00:36:00,688
Rym: if you guys are gonna take advantage of this that we'd like you to do.

504
00:36:01,971 --> 00:36:07,350
Rym: We were thinking about doing a show about the podcast or about us like specifically why we do this who we are or whatever.

505
00:36:08,134 --> 00:36:13,237
Rym: We decided all these I decided just now Instead of interviewing each other.

506
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,501
Scott: or what a democratic system.

507
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:15,504
Rym: How about this?

508
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:17,110
Rym: you guys interview us?

509
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:22,270
Rym: Send us audio questions and we'll set it up to where you the listeners interview us one day.

510
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:24,203
Rym: Once we have enough questions do a whole show.

511
00:36:24,364 --> 00:36:25,169
Scott: that could be pretty cool.

512
00:36:25,571 --> 00:36:26,413
Scott: Now there's two ways.

513
00:36:26,493 --> 00:36:38,970
Scott: number one you just record yourself make an mp3 or a wav file or something and email it as an attachment or Put it on the web and email a link to that location any kind of technology way.

514
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:43,930
Scott: Yeah to GeekNights at gmail.com and in the subject put audio feedback.

515
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:58,863
Scott: The other way you can leave us audio feedback is we have a voicemail box and the way this works is you call this phone number and you leave a voicemail and We will get an email with your voicemail as an attachment and we can use that.

516
00:36:59,545 --> 00:37:15,510
Scott: the phone number you can call is 1 5 3 7. that's 206 3 3 3 1 5 3 7.

517
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,133
Rym: Outstanding.

518
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:20,209
Scott: I'm gonna go use that little program on the internet that tells me what words I can make with those numbers.

519
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:27,041
Rym: But Yeah, so interview us ask us whatever you want.

520
00:37:27,523 --> 00:37:31,616
Rym: no quite no question is out of bounds though You may not get a serious answer.

521
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:37,309
Scott: Yeah, and If we don't like your question, we are in no way obligated to actually use it.

522
00:37:37,611 --> 00:37:39,137
Rym: Yeah, or we might just make fun of you.

523
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:40,703
Scott: Like if you just call in and go.

524
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:42,270
Scott: blaga blaga blaga blaga.

525
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:47,777
Rym: Oh, we'll probably play it but oh Yeah, identify yourself.

526
00:37:47,858 --> 00:38:00,945
Rym: I don't you know in some way like hi, I'm or hi, I'm Fred yeah, and don't make it too long because Yeah, verbosity is not what we're after here.

527
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:07,610
Scott: Yep Not but if your verbosity is high-quality Yes, I go from penny arcade.

528
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:09,945
Scott: Yeah, go for it.

529
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:13,489
Rym: But I had to quote some words of wisdom.

530
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:18,906
Rym: People who don't understand analogy shouldn't make them and people who don't understand big words should not use them.

531
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:19,467
Scott: Mmm.

532
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:20,290
Scott: All right.

533
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:29,689
Scott: In addition, I hate asking for like votes cuz you know They had their web pages where you vote for things and then they go up in the list.

534
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:34,755
Scott: but I kind of Everyone else asks for votes.

535
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:51,970
Scott: So if you go to podcast alley calm and vote for us then that means our link will like appear higher up and people will see it and That's a good way that you can get more people to listen to us Even if you don't have any other people to tell

536
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:53,533
Rym: The girl.

537
00:38:53,553 --> 00:38:55,909
Rym: of course only do this if you actually think where we deserve it.

538
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:58,567
Scott: Yeah, if you think we suck don't freakin vote for us.

539
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:04,498
Scott: God Of course In even better ways to just tell your friends.

540
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,510
Scott: Yeah, or spread the word on other forms.

541
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,354
Rym: I'm very happy.

542
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:17,770
Rym: listenership has been rising steadily from the moment We started at a very steady and predictable rate, which is kind of scary and kind of cool at the same time.

543
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,905
Scott: Yep, also our forums are quite hopping.

544
00:39:21,086 --> 00:39:25,510
Rym: Yeah, they're hopping Madly, and they're very much keeping me busy at work when I'm here.

545
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:31,230
Scott: There aren't a crap ton of people there, but there's quite a few people and they're posting a lot.

546
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:35,222
Scott: So if you're not in the forums, you need to go there.

547
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:44,164
Scott: Yeah, just go to front row crew calm and Click on forum and then sign up and I'll approve you and post away.

548
00:39:44,184 --> 00:39:47,373
Rym: Oh and also one more bit We're looking for.

549
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:52,070
Rym: I need some tips on how to make Scott fucking be awake during the podcast.

550
00:39:53,632 --> 00:40:04,801
Rym: Yeah, if you can find out a way to you know Or just give me a way to drug him with caffeine because he refuses to take any form of caffeine into his body Even though that would solve all of his problems not gonna drink caffeine.

551
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:05,302
Rym: Why not?

552
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,007
Scott: or eat it caffeine's fine.

553
00:40:07,248 --> 00:40:07,850
Scott: Not a chance.

554
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:09,476
Rym: There have been two studies recently.

555
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:10,802
Rym: the show caffeine is good for you.

556
00:40:11,304 --> 00:40:12,810
Scott: And there have been many studies before the show.

557
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:16,339

00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,873
Scott: What's wrong with the?

563

Rym: don't you realize there's edible oils full of preservatives and chemicals?

564
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,095
Scott: It's an edible oil Edible being the key.
