00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,767
Scott: It's Monday November 28th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:25,606
Scott: today We talked about well sort of nothing because it was kind of a crazy weekend since you know No, Thanksgiving show and the whole bunch of stuff, so We just keep talking about stuff for about 45 minutes.

3
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,319
Rym: Enjoy, let's do this do this.

4
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:34,415
Scott: So I'm walking to work from the train station.

5
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,284
Scott: Okay, and I'm next.

6
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:40,040
Scott: I'm on the the south side of the library near Bryant Park.

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:53,920
Scott: You know walk in west and I hear a scream from across the street alright, so it was kind of this weak-ass scream like And I thought it was just like some horse playing kids or something like that.

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,227
Scott: You know that's what it sounded like.

9
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:55,710
Scott: was you know?

10
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:57,400
Scott: just some people fooling around?

11
00:00:57,581 --> 00:01:02,360
Scott: You know maybe a guy like you know messing with his girlfriend or something right, but they hear it again.

12
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:08,900
Scott: So of course I turned my head to the left to see what's up And I see a lady or a girl.

13
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:20,466
Scott: I couldn't really tell because I only looked for like a half second at this point like on the ground And I'm like oh, maybe someone pushed her or something right you know In a half second later.

14
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:21,832
Scott: I realized wait a minute.

15
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:30,959
Scott: There's a guy with a purse running and I'm like freaking purse snatcher.

16
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:39,934
Scott: There's no way Who would be so dumb to snatch a purse these days in a crowd of people.

17
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:41,663
Scott: I Can't.

18
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:42,899
Scott: it is a purse snatcher.

19
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:45,358
Rym: Okay, did someone stop him?

20
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,457
Scott: Three guys immediately like grabbed him and like smashed him into this car, and I was like oh Yeah, well that that's expected right there.

21
00:01:54,497 --> 00:02:00,379
Scott: Yeah But it was just so amazing that someone could be so dumb.

22
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:03,683
Scott: It It's like alright.

23
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:08,818
Scott: There's a people who are dumb, and it's like okay that guy's dumb, but I understand his dumbness.

24
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,366
Rym: um You don't read FARC.

25
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:18,076
Scott: no no I see the things on FARC But I mean you see something on FARC like guy sets himself on fire attempting stupid stunt.

26
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:19,801
Rym: right and you know you see these Things.

27
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:34,605
Rym: on FARC like guy sets himself on fire because he lit a match to look inside of a gas tank All right, or guy Rob's Store with no weapons in broad daylight when there's a police officer in the store See, but things like that.

28
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,438
Scott: I can at least understand what the person who was doing it was thinking.

29
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:38,940
Rym: really.

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,800
Rym: So why did the person who robbed a store in broad daylight with no gun and there was a cop there?

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,522
Rym: What was he thinking?

32
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,626
Scott: He was thinking one.

33
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:48,499
Scott: he probably didn't have a weapon - he wanted to rob the store.

34
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,666
Scott: three He thought we'd get away with it.

35
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:51,680
Scott: and four he didn't notice the cop before he ran.

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,650
Rym: Oh the cop was a uniformed officer standing there.

37
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,720
Scott: He did he not notice the cop?

38
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,279
Scott: He must have not noticed the cop.

39
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:58,925
Rym: No, he was just dumb.

40
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:02,300
Rym: the cop just walked over and got him putting handcuffs on him.

41
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:04,120
Scott: He must have not seen the cop in the store.

42
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,614
Scott: There's no way he could rob the store after seeing the cop right there.

43
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:08,860
Rym: It was a small store.

44
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:11,085
Scott: I think he didn't see the cop.

45
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:17,997
Scott: There's no way anyone could be so dumb, but anyway the point is this purse snatcher It was just the dumbest guy.

46
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,710
Scott: It's like oh my god was just.

47
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:21,594
Scott: it was serical.

48
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:33,086
Scott: and then like a little crowd formed You know and I was like, you know, hey I took a few pictures and then I was kind of hoping they would kind of bugged me about taking pictures like a little You know, but they didn't bug me.

49
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:36,639
Rym: cuz wait, so this is the story you've been talking up all night.

50
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:45,546
Scott: I saw your snatcher that it's a good story, but you were talking it up so much cuz it's so rare and it's so It's like it's not really.

51
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:46,930
Rym: I mean I was mugged once.

52
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,963
Scott: it's not imagine if you were standing there when the dumb guy used a match To look in the gas tank.

53
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:52,107
Scott: That's what this is.

54
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,234
Scott: Like you're standing there watching FARC.

55
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:55,659
Scott: It doesn't happen every day.

56
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,570
Rym: Yeah, it does happen every day just in different place.

57
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,695
Scott: doesn't happen every day.

58
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:00,799
Scott: to you looking at it.

59
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,485
Rym: No, but I read about it every day.

60
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,692
Scott: Yeah, but I mean it was.

61
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:19,339
Scott: and then that I was standing over there You know and I got pictures of this guy lying on the ground, you know, I thought I would put a big poon on it eventually, but The the cop who showed up when someone ran to go get him was like, what are you looking at me?

62
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,245
Rym: You should have taken this picture.

63
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:21,969
Scott: I did.

64
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:23,335
Rym: All right, what do you do?

65
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:27,149
Scott: Oh So the the cop was like who saw it?

66
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,373
Scott: so I'm like, oh I saw it.

67
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,277
Scott: Oh shit.

68
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:30,300
Scott: I don't want to be a witness.

69
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:32,064
Rym: Are you kidding?

70
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:33,750
Rym: you being a witness is like your dream?

71
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:39,130
Rym: You'd have a you'd have a forget you just be on the stand like No, so some ladies like I saw it.

72
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,518
Scott: I'm like, all right, I can go to work.

73
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:42,604
Scott: So I went to work.

74
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:43,549
Rym: Uh-huh.

75
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,780
Rym: I would have rather been witnessing than working.

76
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:53,160
Scott: Yeah Frankly though if I was gonna be a perfectly honest witness, I didn't actually see the guy take the purse.

77
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,489
Scott: I saw that guy with the purse.

78
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,823
Scott: I saw the lady on the ground and I saw three guys Apprehend him.

79
00:05:01,164 --> 00:05:01,626
Rym: that's fine.

80
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,630
Rym: So you say that how do?

81
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,894
Rym: maybe it wasn't a person at your.

82
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,340
Rym: maybe those three guys were in cahoots?

83
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:07,323
Scott: No, no.

84
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:09,232
Scott: No, I'm 100% sure this guy was a person at you.

85
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:10,780
Rym: But uh, did you see him snatch the purse?

86
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:12,506
Scott: I saw him with the purse running.

87
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:16,040
Scott: Ah, I heard the scream and I saw the lady on the ground.

88
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:20,139
Scott: I think that doesn't leave much room for reasonable doubt.

89
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:22,830
Rym: That's for the course to decide.

90
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:24,160
Scott: it is for the court to decide.

91
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:25,525
Scott: Let's let them do so.

92
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:26,127
Scott: but I got.

93
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:33,379
Scott: I got some pictures, but I learned a couple lessons about picture-taking Number one don't have the camera way in the backpack.

94
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:39,522
Scott: If I would have gotten it out sooner, I could have taken pictures of his weak-ass kung fu He.

95
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:46,099
Scott: basically the only fight he put up was you know, trying to run away and and you know Get out of the grappling of the guys.

96
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,940
Scott: He managed to get his hands free and he did like a little flurry of blows up into the air.

97
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:55,859
Scott: Yeah, and if I would had a picture of that it would've been hilarious But I couldn't get the camera out fast enough.

98
00:05:56,482 --> 00:06:06,383
Scott: The second thing I learned is keep well besides keeping the camera in your pocket ready to go in any moment You know is just hold the button down and take a zillion pictures Because

99
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:08,570
Rym: you can always crop things out later and because it's

100
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:11,500
Scott: a digital camera and I have so many megabytes of space in there.

101
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:23,980
Scott: I took four pictures because Number one I took a picture right and then I looked around to try to get another shot And then people started milling about in my way and that was just like screw damn.

102
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:32,157
Scott: So from now on if any if I ever see anything crazy, I'm just gonna be like whip it out.

103
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:32,859
Scott: click click click click.

104
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,940
Rym: Yeah, I noticed you got the camera sitting there at arm's length right now, yeah, you want to look at the pictures.

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,607
Scott: They're pretty funny.

106
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:43,534
Rym: Uh See it was a good story, but you talked it up so much all night.

107
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:48,010
Scott: Like I got this crazy story Happens to you doesn't happen every day.

108
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,280
Scott: It's like a once-in-a-year thing.

109
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:54,886
Rym: So you guys but honestly if that happened to me, I would have come home and I would said hey So I saw a purse snatcher.

110
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:59,647
Rym: Yeah, I just it's special for I would just said yeah Well, I grew up in Detroit.

111
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:06,920
Scott: So it's special for me because you know Not only is it not something you see every day, but I didn't think purse snatchers still existed.

112
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:17,962
Scott: Yeah, I grew up in the land of not just purse snatchers, but like outright muggers I mean he's like and if there was a purse snatcher you snatch a purse late at night in a dark alley where there's no one Else around.

113
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:21,759
Scott: you don't snatch a purse on a crowded street as people are walking to work.

114
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:29,812
Rym: It depends if you a snatch a purse in a crowd and you just keep walking like nothing's up and stick it under your trench By the time she goes.

115
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:32,805
Rym: hey someone stole my purse This guy first.

116
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:34,332
Scott: he had to wrestle it away from the woman.

117
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,200
Scott: This isn't like a pickpocket pickpocket.

118
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:40,934
Rym: You got to wait for the person walking by with the purse that's hanging by a thread.

119
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:42,700
Scott: Yeah, okay, that's good.

120
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,266
Scott: But this guy this was not.

121
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:45,552
Scott: this is actually the purse.

122
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:47,239
Scott: I was pretty surprised was freaking huge.

123
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,830
Scott: It was like half a suitcase man.

124
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,180
Scott: It had these giant handles.

125
00:07:52,180 --> 00:08:00,687
Scott: I was like, whoa There must have been something really good in there or this guy needed some serious money to buy drugs or something To make him do something soda generally.

126
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:04,840
Rym: I've seen that the bigger purse someone has the less money they actually have in it.

127
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:10,656
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what was in there But there must have been something good that he knew was in there for him to take it.

128
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:11,580
Scott: so dumbly.

129
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:14,980
Rym: I'm glad I don't need to carry enough stuff on me to require a purse.

130
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,068
Rym: I carry a tiny wallet that has everything.

131
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:19,900
Scott: I got too many gizmos now, but I can fit him in all my pockets.

132
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,544
Rym: So it's all good sound have so many gizmos and usually if I go anywhere where I need gizmos I have my trench coat.

133
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,830
Scott: I only take the gizmos I need.

134
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:31,638
Scott: I don't take all my gizmos everywhere But I do take all my gizmos to working back every day because I can and have a backpack and stuff.

135
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:36,652
Rym: so Someone fixed at least one of the problems with the Xbox.

136
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:38,580
Scott: Oh the the crashing.

137
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,755
Rym: Yeah, they suspended the powers fly by a string and it didn't overheat anymore.

138
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,280
Scott: I guess that works.

139
00:08:45,901 --> 00:09:03,159
Rym: Yeah, apparently the pot if you were looking the owner's manual and basically the only way to actually use the Xbox correctly is to Put it on a hard cool Surface away from any other object and put the power supply on a similarly hard cool surface far away from everything and they can't even Be near each other.

140
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:09,947
Scott: It's so weird because some people have the problem and some people don't and other people have kind of the problem and other people It's just crashing all over the place.

141
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:12,720
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people do reports or numbers or anything.

142
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:15,651
Rym: It's definitely some sort of hardware overheating issue.

143
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:23,215
Scott: I heard one theory was that People were talking about how much money Microsoft loses on the Xbox 360.

144
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:26,326
Rym: Yeah about 140 bucks 126 whatever.

145
00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:39,031
Scott: but the the point was is that guy basically did his calculations based on the normal prices of the components and then they were talking about how Microsoft bought in bulk and they got a Discount on the components that wasn't calculated in because of how much they bought.

146
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,298
Scott: and then they're like then they bought some.

147
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:46,755
Scott: maybe they bought Some cheaper components than you think in order to get the price down even more.

148
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,240
Scott: so they make less of a loss.

149
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,840
Scott: But maybe the cheaper components are why it's crashing.

150
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:56,075
Rym: Well part of the problem is honestly computer power supplies are very unreliable.

151
00:09:56,477 --> 00:10:03,320
Rym: even top-end Server data center power supplies are actually pretty piss-poor and fail on a fairly regular basis.

152
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:07,264
Scott: I had one fail on me and I didn't even know that was it But I couldn't.

153
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:08,193
Scott: now I'm gonna remember it.

154
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:13,597
Rym: for the rest of my life I've had three power supplies fail on me in my time as a personal computer user.

155
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:15,650
Rym: two of them were Antec's.

156
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:18,552
Scott: I believe Antec makes power supplies.

157
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,027
Scott: Yeah That's when I bought my new computer.

158
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:26,955
Rym: I bought like this super and at work thing at work I've had at least ten servers have power supplies.

159
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:27,800
Rym: just go or start.

160
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:35,140
Scott: Like the more power says something has and the more power supply it has the more likely it is to just not work.

161
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:50,980
Rym: Actually the what what goes on there is that almost every power supply even from companies you think you trust that make power supplies They really really really overstate the power and when you buy a 500 watt power supply It can really only output 300 watts reliably.

162
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:56,978
Scott: Well, that must be why the 300 watt power supplies don't actually make the computers boot and you need to get the 400 watt one.

163
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,880
Rym: Yeah, unless you buy a real power supply from an actual company.

164
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:04,960
Rym: But those are very very expensive because switched power supplies are very expensive.

165
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:14,360
Scott: Yeah, see as long it doesn't really matter as long as it did they're consistent, you know It's like how many people who buy a 400 watt power supply for their computer?

166
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,500
Scott: Actually like are counting the watts and and all that kind of stuff.

167
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,619
Scott: They're just trying to get something that'll make the computer boot And as long as they know the right number to buy to make that happen, it's it's all good.

168
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:36,819
Rym: Though I mean with the Xbox at least it seems to be more an issue of Microsoft didn't test the Xbox in an actual environment where someone might use it that could be part of it.

169
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,980
Scott: I think also some people are right in that.

170
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,400
Scott: I think a lot of the giant power supply bricks are a mixture of different parts and all kinds of crazy things to cut costs.

171
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:47,836
Scott: Yeah, it seems very likely.

172
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:53,256
Rym: Well, the Xbox itself has its own issues because that if you've heard reports that it's loud.

173
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:54,420
Rym: That's an understatement.

174
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:56,250
Rym: It's louder than my computer.

175
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:01,860
Rym: My computer is a 70 pound Monstrosity in a giant tower with rattling fans.

176
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:07,019
Scott: I wish there was some way we could raise your computer off the ground with a string to prevent it from overheating.

177
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:10,623
Rym: My computer isn't actually overheat It beeps.

178
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:22,580
Rym: Yeah, it beeps and I fixed that by raising the threshold at which it beeps thing is my computer is fairly reliable and Yeah, I'm not buying a new one anytime soon.

179
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,940
Rym: Yeah, I guess though if I buy a new one I can record this cast in stereo instead of mono.

180
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,826
Scott: Hey, you just buy a new sound card for that.

181
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:31,130
Rym: No, my sound card does it.

182
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:38,660
Rym: it just post-production becomes really really slow because My computer takes a long time to condense a bunch of tracks into two as opposed to into one.

183
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:38,933
Rym: You

184
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:41,067
Scott: know you could use my computer or Pete's computer

185
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:45,639
Rym: now because the time the the time and effort of putting all the files on your computer doing it and then

186
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:50,397
Scott: You could use SSH and then you use some command line programs and yeah,

187
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,070
Rym: yeah I do that

188
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,738
Scott: don't have the skills.

189
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:57,940
Rym: No I just have to actually do it every day and then go over into your computer and do it or X forward into your computer.

190
00:12:58,161 --> 00:12:59,345
Scott: You could use Pete's computer.

191
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,934
Rym: the server server is not that fast.

192
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,440
Scott: It's a lot faster than your computer.

193
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:05,426
Scott: How fast is it fast as my computer?

194
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:08,577
Scott: I think it's like a one point six gigahertz.

195
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:10,564
Rym: I think yeah I got a one gigahertz.

196
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:12,151
Scott: So you got point six more.

197
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,220
Scott: also, it's an Athlon XP not a Thunderbird.

198
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:19,660
Rym: Yeah, the problem the limiter still seems to be ran because the CPU doesn't max out most of the time.

199
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,791
Scott: Well, that computer also is a crap ton of rain.

200
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:23,520
Rym: My computer has almost a gig around.

201
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:25,083
Scott: Well, there you go.

202
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:32,213
Scott: my computer doesn't so much only is 512 but it's it's DDR 400s real fast Of course, I also got a crappy Sound Blaster live.

203
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:33,360
Rym: It's actually a platinum.

204
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,540
Scott: It's the best Sound Blaster live yet a Sound Blaster live value of my computer, but I don't use it anymore.

205
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:39,740
Scott: I use the enforce thing that's on the motherboard.

206
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:44,980
Rym: Yeah, you know the value and the platinum are the same except they solder some things to the point of breaking them.

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,609
Scott: Well values they don't have the original original value.

208
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:52,483
Scott: when I when I bought the value the only choices were value and gold Didn't exist.

209
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,149
Rym: I bought the platinum the day it came out.

210
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,377
Scott: platinum came way later like a year later.

211
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:57,320
Rym: wasn't that much later?

212
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:01,293
Rym: No, it was actually pretty quick because the platinum and the regular.

213
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,240
Rym: the only difference between them is the software they come with.

214
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:05,791
Scott: Yeah, they never really changed the card that much.

215
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,680
Scott: They just kept re-releasing it with different labels.

216
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,659
Scott: Remember they had like an mp3 plus and a game.

217
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:14,400
Rym: Yeah, the only one that's different is the value because the value is actually missing a lot of core functionality.

218
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:15,926
Scott: That's all I needed back in the day.

219
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:18,475
Scott: Yeah, you know, it gave me my 4.1 audio.

220
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:19,218
Scott: It sounded good.

221
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:19,640
Scott: It was cheap.

222
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:20,289
Scott: I was there.

223
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:31,611
Scott: Ah Nowadays, I got high quality stuff with the onboard whatever with the optical and my new speakers which do most of the work because Linux sure as hell doesn't do the work About speakers that do it instead.

224
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:40,020
Scott: Yeah, so U of R Developed this new thing where they can actually take pictures of retinas in people's eyeballs.

225
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:41,644
Rym: That's kind of old news actually.

226
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:45,354
Scott: But yeah, I saw that and apparently everyone has different cones and rods.

227
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:47,219
Rym: Yeah, didn't we talk about that?

228
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:49,410
Rym: Already I don't think so.

229
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,023
Scott: All right, I never saw this before Really?

230
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,894
Rym: Cuz I thought we talked about it not on the podcast just in general.

231
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:56,320
Scott: We might have talked about something related.

232
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,009
Rym: No, I'm pretty sure we talked about that itself.

233
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:02,590
Rym: I looked at my aim log at work tomorrow Maybe but the thing we talked about today on aim.

234
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,838
Scott: No, we didn't I think we did.

235
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:17,060
Scott: But anyway The thing is is that even though everyone has different cones and rods They're pretty sure that everyone's brain kind of arrives at a very similar result despite huge differences in the cones.

236
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:18,280
Rym: Yeah, we did talk about this.

237
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,500
Rym: It's the same reason why even though you see something like a room under yellow light.

238
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:31,000
Rym: You still know what color everything is and you still see it as red even though In terms of light, it's actually not red at all and nothing would detect it as red, but your eyes still sees it as red.

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,067
Scott: Yeah, but you'd think that people with like a bunch of red cones would see red stuff better, but maybe actually yeah They would see it better, but they still see it as red.

240
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:42,520
Scott: Yeah, but like maybe they would see green stuff more poorly.

241
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:45,500
Rym: But that's why that's one of the reasons why women tend to have.

242
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:53,874
Rym: women actually have more rods and cones in their eyes specifically a lot more cones and Women tend to actually be able to differentiate between colors much better than men.

243
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:56,485
Scott: Uh-huh That's cool.

244
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:59,459
Scott: Yeah, but you know nothing wrong with my eyeballs.

245
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:05,400
Rym: Yeah, even though you didn't seem to see the microphone stand sitting right next to the other microphone stands a Radio Shack.

246
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,708
Scott: Hey, it's nothing to do with it Mr.

247
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,899
Scott: Can't tell red from orange?

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,699
Rym: I Note that in mule the color of the characters on the orange team is orange not red.

249
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,454
Scott: There were things that are red and you point to them and say they're orange.

250
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:28,277
Scott: you point to things Advance wars which are red and you say they're orange now because if you look at the palette, they're actually orange.

251
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,000
Scott: Oh, they're not.

252
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:29,689
Scott: Yeah, they are.

253
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:35,972
Rym: Oh, they're not anyway Mmm, so Sony's rootkit fiasco is just getting better and better.

254
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:37,316
Scott: What the hell this kid.

255
00:16:37,337 --> 00:16:38,260
Scott: this has to be over by now.

256
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:49,640
Rym: No, apparently the company that made the rootkit forum first for internet Someone found a couple of posts from an employee of theirs who was asking for help on these news groups.

257
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,879
Rym: He wanted people to give him the source code to lame and like to help him write everything and he was offering money for it.

258
00:16:56,081 --> 00:17:16,339
Scott: So Sony basically hired this crap company to make something for them and they hired a crap programmer and that one crap Programmer who didn't know what the hell he was doing ended up making the giant giant butterfly effect type fiasco where his tiny tiny stupidity made a huge problem for everybody.

259
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:17,944
Rym: a Quote from his post.

260
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:24,772
Rym: I know it sounds like I'm just after some free code due to my laziness But I really don't have the time and I'm serious about the cash.

261
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:26,220
Rym: I really need this functionality.

262
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,822
Rym: I know that that was all one sentence a Winner.

263
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:33,578
Scott: Yeah, I think he's almost as big a winner as the purse snatcher.

264
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:40,320
Rym: I gotta say there are a lot of bad coders out there that seem to just copy stuff from other programs and clutch it together.

265
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:43,780
Scott: You mean like all the people who barely made it through?

266
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:51,795
Scott: You know like RIT the people who are like scraping together their projects and everything Yeah, or all the people in their cs4 class this year who cheated.

267
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:54,003
Scott: Oh Yeah, I heard that story.

268
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:54,425
Scott: Yeah.

269
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:56,211
Rym: Yeah, I don't get it.

270
00:17:56,251 --> 00:18:05,991
Rym: people cheat at RIT on a CS class And at RIT the way they do it is if you're caught cheating the minimum punishment is an automatic act And often they suspend or expel you.

271
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:07,298
Scott: Yeah, that's what they should do.

272
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:14,268
Scott: Yep, but I mean it's so obvious to any student looking at another student Like that guy actually knows what he's doing.

273
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:19,184
Scott: That guy is just doing the work and getting through, you know It's just obvious.

274
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:26,371
Scott: there you don't even need to like I'm pretty sure it's obvious the professor's also But they have to give the grade based on the syllabus and whatever, you know, they do.

275
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:30,987
Scott: but when it's so obvious You should just be like look seriously.

276
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:31,852
Scott: You don't belong here.

277
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:32,756
Scott: You don't know what you're doing.

278
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,223
Scott: You don't care You're not trying.

279
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:35,547
Scott: I mean, come on.

280
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:39,540
Scott: Why are you doing CS if you're if you're not and paying a billion dollars to go.

281
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:40,284
Scott: All right, you know what?

282
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:42,939
Rym: because then the retention rate would be even lower.

283
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:48,220
Scott: Well, you just you know, you accept more people in the first place, but then even more of them will fail out.

284
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,920
Scott: Well, you make the standards real high.

285
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:53,415
Rym: That's why they keep wanting to build more dorms and everything because they can't.

286
00:18:53,455 --> 00:19:01,319
Rym: they can't accept more people They can't fit them and even though half of them will fail out They got to hold them all their standards But then not enough people will go and they won't make enough money.

287
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:11,460
Scott: You either have to raise the standards to make it really hard so that all kinds of awesome people come like You know at MIT and all those other high up schools or lower the standards and make it easier.

288
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:18,140
Scott: You can't have it be hard with low standards or else you get these dumb people doing hard stuff and not succeeding.

289
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:28,580
Scott: And you know what those people tend to give you money Yeah, but it'd be a lot better to have you know Other people to give you money who actually stay and keep giving and giving and giving and giving and giving and giving.

290
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:34,640
Rym: Yeah, but remember it costs a lot more per student to take care of upperclassmen in college than it does for freshmen.

291
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:39,600
Scott: Well, it's almost nothing to take care of lots and lots of upperclassmen doing lots and lots of expensive things.

292
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:44,239
Scott: You can afford to even more dorms for even more fodder freshmen who will go out?

293
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,380
Rym: Yeah, because there's not a lot of stuff at least in IT research money at least in IT.

294
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,639
Rym: You know the biggest major on campus they there's not so much useful research coming out of there.

295
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:54,968
Scott: See, that's the other thing.

296
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:56,839
Scott: is you got to actually have some useful research.

297
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:00,700
Rym: There's not so much useful IT research that universities can really do anymore.

298
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:04,012
Scott: There's plenty of stuff that can still be done.

299
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,766
Rym: this stuff being done even today Oh, yeah, but a lot of it's not.

300
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:08,112
Rym: no one cares about it.

301
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:11,225
Rym: and even companies that are looking for technology Don't care about new fields.

302
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:15,280
Rym: They don't care about things like ipv6 or high bandwidth carrier lines.

303
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:18,473
Rym: Most company you're still happy with their freaking t1 and their net.

304
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:25,777
Scott: Yeah, but it's not about companies It's about getting research money from like, you know, the National Science whatever is that money's drying up?

305
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:31,700
Scott: Yeah You know money is drying up which means fighting for it is even, you know more competitive.

306
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:39,420
Scott: So you really have to put up a fight or you're gonna get or just accept a bunch of students and get a whole bunch Of money from then instead, but then that's not a good long-term plan.

307
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,304
Scott: That's just what I'm saying.

308
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,717
Scott: is it works, but it's not a good long-term plan in the long term.

309
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:43,180
Scott: That'll fail.

310
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:43,943
Rym: I don't know though.

311
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:47,819
Rym: It's been working for a long time and it's slowly slowly not working as well.

312
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:48,685
Rym: I don't know.

313
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:51,040
Rym: The attention rate isn't getting worse is staying about the same.

314
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:53,146
Scott: Yeah, people are getting dumber.

315
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:54,833
Scott: It's gonna hurt him now.

316
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,159
Rym: They'll just dumb their all the classes down.

317
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:57,490
Scott: They don't.

318
00:20:57,511 --> 00:20:58,039
Scott: that's what I said.

319
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,304
Scott: They have to make it easier.

320
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:03,339
Rym: if you gonna have low acceptance or what they could do is make all these easy.

321
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:09,180
Rym: Oh if they want to be evil make all the class is easy Until the senior year and then suddenly they get really difficult.

322
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,955
Rym: So only the really smart people pass and all the other people just got suckered into spending a hundred grand on nothing.

323
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,283
Scott: I Guess you could.

324
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:17,046
Rym: I could see him doing that.

325
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,055
Scott: I don't know how that would profit for them.

326
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:20,200
Rym: How would it not profit him?

327
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:21,983
Scott: I just don't.

328
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:24,493
Scott: what's the point of not giving you someone one more year?

329
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:30,094
Rym: you get one more year money out of them because Then people will say oh RIT grads are crap because they would be.

330
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:32,700
Scott: a lot of them are Yeah.

331
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:43,280
Rym: But I've learned kind of scarily enough in my job workings that People from other like people who go to get learn IT or CS from a school that doesn't specialize in IT or CS.

332
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:44,925
Rym: No offense to anyone out there.

333
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:46,469
Rym: They often are terrible.

334
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:52,510
Scott: Yeah, the thing is is like it's so random That you know people just don't.

335
00:21:52,590 --> 00:22:00,740
Scott: basically just don't trust college graduates, you know They only want to look at all kinds of other stuff They like some people would go to like a community college, right?

336
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:08,720
Scott: And little do you know that that community college had like one genius CS professor teacher of awesome and all his students learned amazing things.

337
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:18,739
Scott: But you know at some really awesome college you can get through by slacking off, you know 99% of college graduate guys who come to you they all suck.

338
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:21,911
Rym: Well, I think a lot of that is that people trust any of.

339
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:26,711
Rym: a lot of people in college don't have any real-world Experience and really can't live on their own.

340
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:36,433
Scott: Yeah, that's that's another problem That comes from even before in the high school days that I don't know into now like all the kids I remember from college whose parents visit him every weekend or every weekend.

341
00:22:36,453 --> 00:22:38,260
Rym: They drove back home to be with their family.

342
00:22:38,401 --> 00:22:48,619
Rym: Yeah Those kids need I knew one girl who her mom came and did her lot like took her laundry and did it and brought her Food so she wouldn't have to go shopping or eating the deed in the cafeteria with anyone.

343
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,825
Scott: Yeah, a little problem.

344
00:22:51,006 --> 00:22:54,020
Rym: Yeah, she failed out after a couple years expected.

345
00:22:54,965 --> 00:23:02,240
Scott: alright, so There's this guy and he has a let's see 12 satellite dishes on his front porch.

346
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:07,719
Scott: That's dumb and he's getting five thousand different radio and TV stations with it.

347
00:23:08,661 --> 00:23:13,375
Rym: Alright, so he's getting more media than he can possibly consume and he's going about to buy his 13th dish.

348
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:15,160
Rym: I think he's obsessed.

349
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,593
Scott: He's a 54 year old former ice cream salesman.

350
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,379
Scott: I Think he's got a little problem.

351
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:29,788
Scott: Okay, unless he has let's see 12 TiVo's I Don't think he's watching as much as he can watch.

352
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:31,154
Rym: What was that statistic?

353
00:23:31,214 --> 00:23:32,760
Rym: that more porn is made.

354
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,634
Rym: There is more than an hour's worth of porn made every hour in the world.

355
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:38,060
Scott: Yeah, that's about right.

356
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,859
Rym: Yeah, so it is physically impossible to watch all of the pornography that has been created.

357
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:48,093
Scott: You could have multiple televisions and watch multiple porn simultaneously.

358
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:50,100
Rym: Yeah, but then you're multitasking.

359
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:52,838
Scott: Hey if you had two penises.

360
00:23:54,202 --> 00:24:04,620
Rym: Uh-huh, though speaking of porn this guy in Utah Ralph Yarrow Wants to standardize like remember how when they wanted to make an xxx domain and all the porn in there

361
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,380
Scott: The xxx domain it would make it easier for people who want porn to find it and not easily block anyone who didn't know.

362
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,213
Rym: I disagree with it because one would you make a law saying porn has to go there?

363
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:16,220
Rym: Yes, what's porn?

364
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:19,631
Rym: How do you define pornography would have?

365
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:21,259
Rym: what a site about mammograms go there?

366
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:23,291
Rym: What about something you just disagree with?

367
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,820
Rym: what about a girl in a short skirt?

368
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,034
Rym: Some people are offended by people who don't wear a vane.

369
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:29,444
Scott: it is in the place You are.

370
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:31,759
Rym: any if you all right, so then does he realize that?

371
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:40,594
Rym: If you're in Utah, all right, all the porn from Utah is in xxx, but then in Southern, California There's a bunch of stuff that you would consider porn.

372
00:24:40,634 --> 00:24:41,419
Rym: That's not an xxx.

373
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:56,866
Scott: Yeah, so if I was in California and a site was let's say normally something.com right, but in Utah that was considered porn I would have to go to something that That's not workable at all.

374
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,392
Scott: Why not one?

375
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,520
Rym: we are you gonna make it every who decides?

376
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,163
Rym: What's porn?

377
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:08,240
Rym: so someone who has a website say I'm in I'm in Southern, California, and they don't care about it, and I have a porn site and it's something calm.

378
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:11,880
Rym: You're saying I have to buy an xxx specifically for other places.

379
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:15,720
Scott: No, it's up to the other places to put you in xxx in their place.

380
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,123
Rym: What do you mean?

381
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:18,218
Rym: put you or the other places put you in xxx as?

382
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,639
Rym: In it is it basically you want them to give you a free domain?

383
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,601
Scott: No, it's.

384
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:30,860
Scott: if they want to make me xxx in their state then they have to take calm and make it xxx.

385
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,085
Rym: You can't do that.

386
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:32,547
Scott: Why not?

387
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,254
Rym: That's not how it works Scott.

388
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:35,520
Rym: That's not how DNS works.

389
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:37,004
Scott: That's tough.

390
00:25:37,748 --> 00:25:38,433
Rym: there's really there's.

391
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:38,654
Scott: I do it.

392
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:39,480
Scott: that way you can do it.

393
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,006
Rym: Yeah, there's no technical way to do it.

394
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:41,307
Rym: plus.

395
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:44,500
Rym: I there would still be besides if you did that all right fine.

396
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,404
Rym: So it routes it.

397
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:47,453
Rym: see if you go dot xxx takes you calm.

398
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:51,622
Rym: the calm would still work Mmm.

399
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:55,518
Rym: Yeah, I don't think you understand how DNS works because that is an absolutely impossible thing to do.

400
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:58,028
Scott: No, maybe we should upgrade to have PVC.

401
00:25:58,248 --> 00:25:59,894
Rym: that that still there's no way to.

402
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,063
Rym: that is nothing to do with DNS at all You realize.

403
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:04,860
Scott: yeah, how about just people who consider themselves to be poor?

404
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:09,835
Scott: I mean people who are porn sites want it because it'll make people find them easier.

405
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:12,881
Rym: Yeah, but they'll also keep their comms Don't?

406
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:20,779
Rym: the only people who've advocated for this seriously are people who think they can make laws that'll force all porn to be on xxx and nowhere else under penalty of law.

407
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:25,023
Rym: That way they can block xxx Define porn.

408
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:29,340
Scott: it would work, but you know you can't with my standards for porn in different places.

409
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,072
Rym: You know yeah, hence.

410
00:26:31,153 --> 00:26:32,120
Rym: It's an unworkable idea.

411
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,559
Scott: You know it would be workable if you let me decide what was porn and what wasn't cuz I could decide pretty easily.

412
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,001
Scott: That's just like this naked It's.

413
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:44,960
Scott: it's basically hey our guys gonna look or guys or girls gonna look at this for the purpose of getting it off.

414
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,433
Rym: Yes, no, but so why should porn have its own domain?

415
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:50,400
Scott: Why is porn special to make it easier to find?

416
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:55,206
Rym: Google It's still You know it.

417
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,477
Scott: It's still not easy to find.

418
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:58,180
Rym: pull anyway.

419
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:02,811
Rym: This guy has about the same understanding of ports as you do of DNS.

420
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:06,200
Rym: apparently he wants there to be a porn ports.

421
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:18,994
Rym: Apparently he found out that there's sixty five thousand five hundred and thirty five ports on a computer that you access the interwebs with and Apparently he figured that right now everything comes in through this one port.

422
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:21,701
Rym: It's like a channel channel 80.

423
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:24,853
Rym: Why is porn coming in the same channel as kids entertainment?

424
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:26,500
Rym: There should be a separate channel for porn.

425
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:28,212
Rym: There's sixty five thousand channels.

426
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:29,259
Rym: most of them are being used.

427
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:32,640
Rym: We should set up a channel for porn channel for education channel for blah blah blah.

428
00:27:34,182 --> 00:27:40,042
Rym: In other words this guy has probably got the least understanding of internet architecture of anyone I've ever.

429
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:41,346
Scott: what hurt us.

430
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:48,525
Scott: what we could do is we could have all web servers serving porn sites run on port 8,000 instead of 80.

431
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:52,998
Rym: you realize that's also silly I know, but that's what he wants right.

432
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,365
Rym: yeah He calls his initiative CP 80 or clean port 80.

433
00:27:58,365 --> 00:28:00,485
Scott: He is Stupid.

434
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:03,217
Scott: he does not know about IP quote.

435
00:28:04,301 --> 00:28:09,420
Rym: So why aren't more of the sixty five thousand plus ports being used for content their plight?

436
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,239
Rym: There's a plentiful amount of channels out there.

437
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:14,376
Rym: Why are we not making adult content and assigning it to its own channel?

438
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:15,160
Rym: doesn't that make sense?

439
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,713
Scott: No, because the ports aren't channels now.

440
00:28:18,974 --> 00:28:23,159
Scott: That's not a synonymous analogy analogous thing.

441
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:36,000
Rym: Congruity yep equality Plus the fact that most corporate firewalls block everything, but port 80 anyway and Almost every bad thing in the world has been made to just proxy through port 80.

442
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,340
Scott: Yes, the thing is some people manage their corporate firewalls really well.

443
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,709
Scott: They say your company doesn't my company does not.

444
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:48,049
Scott: but most companies say anything can go out Nothing can come in.

445
00:28:48,574 --> 00:28:48,735
Rym: yeah.

446
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:51,211
Scott: I gotta say That's the only setting you need.

447
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:52,759
Scott: anything can go out nothing come in.

448
00:28:53,822 --> 00:28:54,947
Rym: What about servers you have?

449
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:57,579
Scott: if you have a server you put it in the DMZ?

450
00:28:58,941 --> 00:29:01,413
Rym: All right, what if you want to dial in?

451
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:02,618
Rym: got a VPN set up?

452
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:05,171
Scott: You have a little separate.

453
00:29:05,634 --> 00:29:12,239
Rym: you know VPN And I assume you mean stateful because if you just set up if you set up access list where anything go out nothing come in.

454
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:21,796
Rym: Nothing could get out either because you'd send a ping out and the reply would never get back to you, but you know no Incoming requests for connection you know?

455
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:26,438
Scott: yeah Yeah, I can take to a web server, and then it sends me back the web page.

456
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:26,980
Scott: it gets better.

457
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,591
Scott: He gets through.

458
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:31,373
Rym: yeah You realize that's pretty much if you set up a like a pick Cisco firewall.

459
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:34,233
Rym: if you do it the basic way That's the default.

460
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:34,720
Rym: yeah.

461
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:39,760
Rym: And the only way you'll have a crap your corporate firewalls if you go out of your way to make it bad.

462
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:45,100
Scott: Basically they went out of their way to basically do a bunch of hacky stuff to make a bunch of these weird proprietary things.

463
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:48,366
Scott: They've got do weird stuff And it basically screws everything up.

464
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:52,300
Rym: that sounds really dubious to me because there aren't many things that do weird things using ports.

465
00:29:52,603 --> 00:29:55,805
Scott: They use just crazy Freaking weird software isn't there?

466
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:57,190
Scott: not a hundred percent awesome?

467
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:01,711
Scott: if you came in there you could clean it up probably real easily because seriously I don't even need to know what the application is.

468
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:04,468
Rym: you want something to go through a firewall And you don't know anything about it.

469
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,360
Rym: run it run ethereal.

470
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:09,409
Scott: The firewall is this sonic wall thing.

471
00:30:09,449 --> 00:30:10,051
Scott: It's basically.

472
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:11,916
Scott: There's a piece of software called sonic wall.

473
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:18,116
Rym: ah but they oh God if you want to run a firewall you buy a router and you put access on.

474
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:19,120
Scott: so they bought this thing.

475
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,385
Scott: It's a sonic wall firewall.

476
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:23,358
Scott: It's basically this piece of hardware that runs this software.

477
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:24,563
Scott: right it's as if you.

478
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:25,929
Scott: it's like kind of like the Google box.

479
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:42,406
Scott: only it runs this firewall software and It has a web interface and everything like that And they just tinker with this thing and it does all kinds of things that firewalls aren't supposed to do Like you can block porn with it even though they turn that off after it basically blocked every internet site There was all

480
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:46,322
Rym: right, so this sounds like a kludgy slow Terrible thing.

481
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:47,225
Scott: it's not slow.

482
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:50,214
Scott: It's just misconfigured because the people handling it aren't perfect.

483
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:50,555
Scott: awesome.

484
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,280
Rym: Wait a minute, but how does it block porn?

485
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:54,683
Scott: It looks.

486
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,429
Rym: if it looks at the content does it?

487
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,220
Rym: do you mean it takes apart the HTV and looks for like keywords?

488
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,967
Scott: If you turn that feature on yeah, it looks for.

489
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,271
Rym: you know how slow that is.

490
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,375
Scott: yeah, it's slow.

491
00:31:04,415 --> 00:31:09,471
Scott: if you turn that on yeah This thing isn't great trust me, but it's not so.

492
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:11,900
Scott: the thing could be great if they didn't mess it up.

493
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:13,367
Scott: Well, it wouldn't be great.

494
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,720
Scott: It would be a normal perfectly normal firewall.

495
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,131
Rym: Well, my consulting rate is $75 an hour.

496
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:19,115
Rym: if they want me to fix everything.

497
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:20,160
Scott: They don't want you to fix everything.

498
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,218
Scott: They think everything's working.

499
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:26,566
Scott: Alright Alright, so here's an awesome thing.

500
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:27,629
Scott: This is pretty awesome.

501
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:28,552
Rym: This is your thing of the day.

502
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:41,360
Scott: No what alright, so There's a game called Call of Duty 2. it's a. it's an army game right alright and as the case with many Multiplayer online type games the users are complaining.

503
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:42,864
Rym: What are they complaining about?

504
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:49,140
Scott: their number one complaint is legitimate in that the developers have not made any sort of anti-cheat anything?

505
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,327
Scott: So cheating is basically rampant.

506
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,960
Rym: alright like counter-strike was for most of his existence.

507
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,300
Scott: I counted right goes for most of his existence except now.

508
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,148
Scott: I think they do have a reasonable expectation that there should be anti cheating systems Because most big games do right.

509
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,961
Rym: Yeah, though there are ways around that you just only play with people You know.

510
00:32:05,981 --> 00:32:06,563
Rym: or like.

511
00:32:06,604 --> 00:32:16,831
Rym: the clan of the fossil rockers was good back in the day when back when people cheated just completely and There was no way to stop them there was this clan where pretty much all the only people are in.

512
00:32:16,872 --> 00:32:21,021
Rym: it were cool people and cool people recommended by cool people and The.

513
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:24,800
Rym: all their servers were password protected and you were guaranteed to get a good game if you went to one of their servers.

514
00:32:25,162 --> 00:32:29,160
Scott: Well, that's cool, but these people have found a I think an okay solution.

515
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,876
Scott: I'm not sure what I think about it yet, but they're gonna have.

516
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:37,580
Scott: oh All of the servers that are in on it are going to strike.

517
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:42,774
Scott: It's not a game like World of Warcraft where Blizzard run where the developer runs the servers.

518
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:45,779
Scott: this it's like counter-strike where the servers are all run by users.

519
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:58,039
Scott: So a bunch of the servers in fact a very very large portion of them are just gonna keep their servers on But change them to say they're on strike and not allow any users to use them.

520
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:04,540
Scott: So when people log in to play the game They're gonna see this list of servers that all say on strike with no one playing.

521
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:07,873
Rym: That's a good idea because I gotta say I've learned that it

522
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:09,540
Scott: basically destroys the game

523
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:24,419
Rym: Especially since that'll really work well just because it seems to be that the people the types of people who run servers for games like that Tend to be the type of people that organize themselves and they all seem to know each other pretty well And it's real easy to spread the word about something like that.

524
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:44,578
Scott: Yep, so they're gonna shut down all the servers for 24 hours and hopefully that will encourage the developers and the people who run the game and publisher or whatever to Develop an anti-cheat system and meet some other demands or else their game is gonna be Pretty poopy as anyone who tries to play it from now on won't have a server to go to.

525
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:50,619
Scott: Yeah, yeah, basically like either you make your game better or will kill your game and you won't make any more money off of it.

526
00:33:51,423 --> 00:33:52,771
Rym: Well, I wish them the best of luck.

527
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:57,698
Rym: Yeah way to go thing of the day.

528
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:06,488
Rym: Okay thing of the day thing of the day Thing of the day is my thing.

529
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:07,351
Rym: What's your thing?

530
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:08,695
Scott: So I saw this.

531
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:09,437
Scott: it's pretty funny.

532
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:11,789
Scott: it today Wasn't really that exciting.

533
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,514
Rym: No, it wasn't.

534
00:34:12,574 --> 00:34:13,239
Rym: Oh my god.

535
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,739
Scott: So so people make fun of the family circus, which isn't hard to make fun of.

536
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:21,079
Rym: Yeah, I mean honestly and I'm not one to say something's objectively bad.

537
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:32,380
Rym: But family circus as a comic or as literature or as a waste of ink on paper is Probably the worst like least entertaining thing I've ever experienced.

538
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:34,628
Scott: I must say I mildly enjoy that.

539
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:36,054
Rym: I was shot at once.

540
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:42,420
Scott: so I must say though I do mildly enjoy the family circuses with the dotted line and he runs around the yard and stuff.

541
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,879
Rym: Oh, I enjoyed it once the first time it was done.

542
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:53,159
Scott: Well, it's because in those at least you can look at all the interesting little like funny things that he does Along the line like oh look he jumped over the pool.

543
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:58,440
Rym: I never thought I'd be in a position where where you mister everything is crap was defending family sir.

544
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,396
Scott: No, no, all the rest of family circus is pretty much ninety nine nine nine percent crap.

545
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:03,320
Rym: You defended a little bit.

546
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,953
Rym: It's like saying yeah, Hitler was a bastard, but he didn't personally kill a baby.

547
00:35:08,013 --> 00:35:08,495
Scott: Well, he was.

548
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:09,939
Scott: he was evil, but he was smart.

549
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:16,476
Scott: It's like, you know, he Stalin was paranoid, but he stayed in power long.

550
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:17,178
Scott: Oh god.

551
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:21,772
Rym: I heard this Wasn't really a joke the other day was just a Something but someone was talking.

552
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:23,160
Rym: They're like, what if Hitler?

553
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:31,528
Rym: Actually went to art school and graduated and became a mass murderer anyway And someone else was like it'd be even worse.

554
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:34,537
Rym: It would have been a more protest slightly more pretentious Hitler.

555
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:45,842
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so anyway, someone remixed the family circus with a good buddy HP Lovecraft Cthulhu photography Really?

556
00:35:45,862 --> 00:35:46,544
Rym: Ah, really?

557
00:35:46,564 --> 00:35:47,828
Scott: Yeah, so it's pretty funny.

558
00:35:47,868 --> 00:35:48,329
Scott: You got these.

559
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,854
Scott: you get these comics named.

560
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:50,396
Scott: Let's see.

561
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,820
Scott: This one's named Mughal.

562
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:55,828
Rym: Ooh, I see one named photography and then one named photography.

563
00:35:58,274 --> 00:35:58,655
Scott: Oh my god.

564
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:00,520
Scott: Okay, the site was a little broken there for a second.

565
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:02,105
Scott: Hey, here's one called bomber.

566
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:03,088
Scott: I can't pass that.

567
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:11,135
Scott: Okay, so there's a picture of the dad in the car with the little girl Next to him and the girl is like rubbing her eye and you see her eyes are closed.

568
00:36:11,195 --> 00:36:12,360
Scott: She seems kind of like oh.

569
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:29,091
Scott: And it says amidst a blinding glare of descending fire the voice of heaven resounded with the blasphemies of hell and the mingling agony of all the lost Reverberated in one apocalyptic planet rendering peel of cyclopean din.

570
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:29,853
Rym: Yeah.

571
00:36:30,093 --> 00:36:43,326
Rym: Yeah, I could do loop a target and the girls like Sorrow you know, it makes me very happy that HP Lovecraft work have gained such a Foothold in geek culture.

572
00:36:43,346 --> 00:36:45,978
Scott: Yeah, I didn't even know who he was before I went to college.

573
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:48,219
Scott: really I guess my mom never even heard of it.

574
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,735
Rym: My mother was really into horror writing and science like dark science fiction type writing.

575
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:53,915
Rym: like.

576
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:55,929
Rym: she was fan of Stephen King and all those people.

577
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:58,085
Rym: But she was rich.

578
00:36:58,106 --> 00:37:00,593
Rym: She always loved HP Lovecraft and at a very young age.

579
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:10,008
Rym: She gave me tales of horror in the macabre And I was hooked on Cthulhu from a very young age never even heard of it until Wow, you even know what it was.

580
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,798
Scott: and then people were like Lovecraft.

581
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:13,299
Scott: Cthulhu I'm like, what the hell you talking about?

582
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:22,629
Rym: But I mean it's got to the point where every gaming store that has even any sort of respectability has multiple Cthulhu Related dolls or plushies.

583
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,371
Rym: That's cuz.

584
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:24,355
Scott: there's that Cthulhu game.

585
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,244
Scott: There's multiple Cthulhu, you know, yeah It's cool.

586
00:37:27,526 --> 00:37:31,944
Rym: Yeah, we actually played the Cthulhu real playing game once Did a little one-off.

587
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,371
Scott: Oh, well, we did also play pokey through.

588
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,220
Rym: now pokey through that game was fantastic.

589
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:40,812
Rym: It was Pokemon plus Cthulhu.

590
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,582
Rym: no more need be said I Liked it.

591
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:44,892
Scott: I think I'd like to play it again.

592
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,360
Rym: Ah All right.

593
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,504
Rym: so my thing of the day.

594
00:37:47,524 --> 00:37:54,879
Rym: remember a long time ago super they had this car that had like this magic suspension with solenoids that Would like make it go over potholes or over stuff.

595
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:56,164
Scott: Well, it basically didn't.

596
00:37:56,585 --> 00:38:05,459
Scott: basically shove the tires into holes and made other tires go up If the other tires were gonna hit a bump and it kept the car as level as could be done.

597
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:07,729
Rym: Yep Well, it's back and it's badass.

598
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:16,683
Rym: now Bo's made a system That's like that only a thousand times better and they're gonna put it in some new like luxury Lexus cars Eventually.

599
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:18,470
Scott: Yeah, why are they putting it in this luxury car?

600
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,979
Scott: So you need because it cost five thousand dollars.

601
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:23,287
Scott: Okay, but why don't you put it in a race car?

602
00:38:23,307 --> 00:38:24,471
Rym: I don't know.

603
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,478
Rym: I think it takes a lot of power.

604
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,069
Rym: I think it actually hurts the gas mileage.

605
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:29,993
Scott: Oh, does it hurt?

606
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:31,440
Rym: Yeah, there's not a lot.

607
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,720
Scott: But if you're in a race car that's not worried about gas mileage like a rally car doesn't need to worry about gas.

608
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:37,634
Scott: It just goes down the hill once or twice, you know.

609
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:37,816
Rym: Yeah.

610
00:38:37,836 --> 00:38:38,380
Rym: Well, it depends.

611
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:47,188
Rym: I mean there's not much information yet but they've got pictures and apparently this car will drive over a two by six piece of wood and Various other bits of debris.

612
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:49,480
Rym: without it like the driver won't even notice.

613
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,267
Rym: Yeah, you could run over a small child.

614
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:52,954
Scott: not even that would definitely help out.

615
00:38:53,074 --> 00:39:02,771
Scott: I think monster trucks It would help out motorcycles that drive it like a motocross type things that drive in the dirt Yeah, yeah max type motocross type things.

616
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:10,456
Rym: and it would help out rally cars huge Rally, it'll help out drivers in Rochester Buffalo and Detroit, you know aka pothole cities.

617
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,640
Scott: Yeah, it'll help them out.

618
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:25,000
Rym: I don't think it'll help out someone like Formula One or NASCAR No, but in Formula One they could drive over that a red and white bit at the edge without going butter butter butter butter butter Maybe.

619
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:26,083
Scott: Somehow.

620
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:27,170
Scott: I don't think it doesn't matter.

621
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:31,900
Rym: that doesn't really slow them down Man, they should just bring back the vacuum cars.

622
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:35,731
Scott: Yeah, so everyone can die again, yeah, but you know what.

623
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:36,694
Rym: that's the risk you take.

624
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:38,260
Rym: you got a super license you're rich.

625
00:39:38,863 --> 00:39:44,640
Scott: It's called first of all, the cars are called ground effects and second of all People stopped driving them because they were so dangerous.

626
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:51,412
Scott: What they need to do is make the car as fast as it can be Where they can still find someone who's willing to drive it who's good.

627
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,399
Scott: I mean, they can always be crazy.

628
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:56,980
Rym: I was about to say yeah, you can find anyone to do just about anything.

629
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,640
Rym: The problem is finding someone to do anything.

630
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:05,208
Scott: Basically what they do is they just take the current racers and if the current racer says this car is too fast I won't drive it then it's too fast.

631
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:05,972
Scott: They won't drive it.

632
00:40:06,374 --> 00:40:10,969
Scott: if the car is you know Not fast enough then they'll say it's yes, this isn't.

633
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,940
Rym: even Schumacher lately is like yeah, the cars are too slow.

634
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:18,860
Scott: Well, it's it's like they're you know, one guy says yeah, the cars are too fast.

635
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,960
Scott: Another guy says no the cars are too slow.

636
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,713
Scott: Well, it's all because one guy can handle it.

637
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:24,979
Scott: one guy can't you know?

638
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:33,593
Scott: They have some people get in these things and there were a lot of people complain that with all the technology that goes into them That it basically driving Formula One is like a video game.

639
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:34,457
Scott: Anyone can do it.

640
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:38,307
Scott: Whatever Meanwhile people who test drive these things like damn that's too fast.

641
00:40:38,347 --> 00:40:38,969
Scott: I can't drive that.

642
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:45,569
Scott: Oh my god You know, it's just the literal speed and acceleration of the car is more than people can handle.

643
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:49,205
Scott: It's like a feet Like what you need.

644
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:50,953
Scott: do you need to wait until you get like five levels?

645
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:52,019
Scott: you get another feet drive f1.

646
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:56,240
Rym: Yeah, well I can imagine cuz I when I was real young I went to a space camp.

647
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:02,060
Rym: Actually, I went to space Academy because I was a little too old for space camp and we got to go in the gravity simulator.

648
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:02,865
Rym: You know the thing.

649
00:41:02,885 --> 00:41:04,395
Rym: they spin you around you make funny faces.

650
00:41:04,415 --> 00:41:08,729
Rym: Yep, and Up around five six G's.

651
00:41:09,392 --> 00:41:11,360
Rym: it's real hard to do anything.

652
00:41:12,282 --> 00:41:15,440
Scott: Yeah, you know f1 is basically like you go into a turn.

653
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,870
Scott: It's five G's at your back and then it's your canes.

654
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,480
Scott: you turn left real quick and it's five G's in the other direction.

655
00:41:20,762 --> 00:41:22,999
Scott: Yep, yep, you know, it's pretty crazy.

656
00:41:23,662 --> 00:41:28,979
Scott: Multiple G's changing all the time as you turn speed up slow down.

657
00:41:29,842 --> 00:41:34,800
Rym: Though there is one thing that is actually harder and more G's than that, you know flying a fighter jet.

658
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:35,807
Scott: Yeah, they were.

659
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,599
Scott: they actually mentioned fighter jets on this f1.

660
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:40,069
Rym: Yeah, so the difference is the reason I found.

661
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,792
Rym: I know the reason.

662
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,960
Scott: fighter jets don't just pass out immediately That don't they have like suits and thing.

663
00:41:45,221 --> 00:41:53,340
Rym: But what the flight suit does is it actually puts pressure on the body Like on the abdomen to keep the blood from spilling out of the head and into the abdomen.

664
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:55,528
Rym: So the blood stays in the brain and you stay conscious.

665
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:56,672
Scott: Yes, that's good.

666
00:41:56,853 --> 00:41:59,787
Rym: It squeezes your real hard All right.

667
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:01,480
Rym: It's actually kind of painful.

668
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,220
Rym: I didn't actually get to do it, but I got to wear a flight suit as part of a cool thing.

669
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,521
Rym: We did.

670
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,345
Rym: Mm-hmm.

671
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:06,927
Rym: You know what?

672
00:42:06,947 --> 00:42:07,449
Rym: It sucks.

673
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:09,156
Rym: Don't ever fly a fighter jet.

674
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:10,040
Rym: It's it it sucks.

675
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:19,371
Scott: You know once I saw this lady who was like the morning talk show TV lady fly like an f-15 and She seemed to be having a good time.

676
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:21,884
Rym: Yeah, if you just fly it around I mean fighter jets.

677
00:42:21,965 --> 00:42:28,240
Rym: modern fighter jets are so computer-controlled that other than Landing pretty much an idiot could fly them.

678
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:29,726
Scott: You see that's what they were talking about with f1.

679
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:32,056
Scott: is is that's why they compared it to the fighter jet?

680
00:42:32,076 --> 00:42:40,332
Scott: because people complained When they were getting too computer-controlled and too easy to drive but the reality was no It's even though it might seem like that.

681
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:52,307
Rym: It's really hard Yep, but the thing is it's easy to fly a fighter jet in a straight line or to do a little turn But if you're actually fighting or flying hard, you'll just pass out and die Probably unless you're trained.

682
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:54,418
Scott: Yep, unless you spend a lot of time in this.

683
00:42:54,498 --> 00:42:59,379
Rym: in course It's not like the US military has ever really fought against anyone else who had fighter jets.

684
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:04,112
Rym: Not since the Korean War makes yeah in the Korean War.

685
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,899
Rym: That was the last time our Air Force engaged another Air Force.

686
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:13,842
Scott: Yeah, the thing is Air Force is really aren't designed to take on Air Forces so much or fighter I have to take on other Forces.

687
00:43:13,962 --> 00:43:18,840
Rym: fighter jets exist should be pretty much purely for air superiority to make sure that no one else has anything in the sky.

688
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:20,187
Scott: Well, I mean that's the thing is though.

689
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:22,680
Scott: Why why would you even put a plane in the sky in the first place?

690
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:29,696
Scott: Well, it's not to blow up another plane because if your planes are only to blow up other planes and that's it Just no one puts any planes up.

691
00:43:30,664 --> 00:43:32,980
Rym: Well, that's why you have multiple kinds of the bombers, right?

692
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:37,900
Scott: The only the real goal is to have the bomber succeed in bombing something.

693
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,400
Scott: Yeah, but that's what the bomber doesn't get blowed up by.

694
00:43:41,524 --> 00:43:42,108
Rym: You do realize.

695
00:43:42,129 --> 00:43:43,540
Rym: that's what air superiority is.

696
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,580
Rym: All it means is you have fighter jets up that ensure that no one else can take off a fighter jet.

697
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:50,260
Rym: Thus no one else can take off anything.

698
00:43:50,512 --> 00:43:53,133
Scott: Yeah but a little a on the ground takes out the whole thing.

699
00:43:53,575 --> 00:44:00,179
Rym: actually know because Our technology is so advanced that any country we've ever fought didn't even have effective a a.

700
00:44:00,822 --> 00:44:02,269
Scott: But I mean a a is so cheap.

701
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:04,560
Scott: you could just have so much of it that doesn't matter how techno.

702
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,504
Rym: But it just doesn't work.

703
00:44:05,524 --> 00:44:06,790
Rym: because you just cruise missile.

704
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,115
Scott: it I guess.

705
00:44:08,196 --> 00:44:10,404
Scott: but if you have a cruise missiles What do you need the bombers for?

706
00:44:10,725 --> 00:44:12,049
Rym: because the bombers are more precision.

707
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,360
Rym: cruise missiles are not as accurate as the media would like you to?

708
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:15,761
Rym: Believe.

709
00:44:16,224 --> 00:44:17,471
Scott: oh, they seem pretty accurate to me.

710
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:23,147
Rym: They're really not a sieve - they're really Yeah, they don't miss.

711
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:25,573
Rym: they never cause a civilian casualty ever.

712
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:26,656
Rym: they just destroy.

713
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:31,660
Scott: whatever unit you wanted to destroy Well destroys the topmost unit in the city because why would you put it anywhere, but a city?

714
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,140
Rym: I used it to take out guys that were standing in front of cities, okay?

715
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,835
Rym: If this I used it to take out.

716
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:37,380
Scott: I need to be clear.

717
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:52,052
Rym: I once used one to take out a transport full of troops that was going towards my capital And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

718
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:53,980
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.
