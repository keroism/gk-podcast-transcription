1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,520
Scott: It's October 31st 2005, this is GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

2
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:16,231
Scott: Let's do this.

3
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:21,218
Scott: We should probably put lira in there whatever.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,264
Scott: Doo doo doo doo?

5
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:24,710
Scott: Oh, I got four.

6
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:27,885
Scott: you start the news like doo doo doo doo doo doo doo But not the noise.

7
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:30,760
Scott: dude me going doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,740
Rym: You want to do that originally?

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:41,060
Rym: We're gonna have the So, uh, I guess we could do that or I could make that sound.

10
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,311
Scott: I think this copyrighted or patented by whatever news.

11
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:47,397
Rym: No, we'll just make it something else.

12
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,180
Rym: It's just Morse code.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,608
Rym: We'll make it say something geeky.

14
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:54,288
Scott: Ah Let's do this in Morse code.

15
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,612
Rym: that's real slick.

16
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:56,073
Rym: I like it.

17
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:57,317
Scott: All right, we're good.

18
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:01,953
Scott: Okay, so Scolito Scolito.

19
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:07,900
Scott: so Personal lawyer didn't cut it to no surprise.

20
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,314
Scott: So he picks the most conservative judge he could find in all of the appeals.

21
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:13,860
Scott: course Samuel Alito.

22
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:20,062
Rym: Yeah He's a little conservative Little bit.

23
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:26,380
Rym: Yeah, cuz this I mean the Senate's main gripe at least the Republicans main gripe with Meyers wasn't that they didn't know about her.

24
00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:29,960
Rym: It was that she wasn't proven to be conservative and not.

25
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:36,041
Scott: Well, this guy's real conservative, but you know, you look at not real real conservative He's.

26
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:38,390
Rym: I don't think he's yeah States rights.

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,413
Rym: I think he's more.

28
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:39,775
Rym: Yeah.

29
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:42,024
Rym: Yeah Rovers his way.

30
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:46,160
Scott: they pretty much call him Scolito and his name is Alito because he's scalia, too.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,430
Scott: But if you look at there's a Scalia, however, you're gonna pronounce.

32
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,715
Scott: I don't know how the correct pronunciation.

33
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:56,748
Scott: I've heard both but Scalia I look at his voting record and like and a lot of things he votes the way.

34
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:58,941
Scott: I want a Lot of things.

35
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:02,272
Scott: he votes horribly and I don't want him to be alive.

36
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:14,718
Rym: Well, I worry because Susanna Sherry She's actually a university law professor at Vanderbilt and she said that he would quote allow a lot more government support of religion than justice o'connor did.

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,122
Scott: Yeah That's Not good.

38
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:26,912
Rym: see I'm all down with religion, but I don't think SCOTUS should have any Kind of backing for it.

39
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:27,759
Rym: or you know.

40
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:32,337
Scott: You know that the problem here is if they let in just a little bit of religion and not enough.

41
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:36,680
Scott: if they let in too Much religion because we'll just fly in there with our flying spaghetti monsters.

42
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:40,997
Rym: Yeah, but if the Supreme Court votes against us, there's no one to appeal to.

43
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:52,779
Scott: well No, but the thing is is that if they give someone else some other religion some sort of you know, nudge Then we just run in there and we say we demand the flying spaghetti monster also gets the same nudge.

44
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:54,268
Rym: Yeah, then we'll deal with.

45
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:58,879
Rym: they will have the schism the ramanites and the pastafarians.

46
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,806
Rym: But I mean he might not get confirmed.

47
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:07,138
Rym: the Senate might filibuster until the end of the Bush administration, we don't know what's gonna happen.

48
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:14,654
Rym: Hmm oh Speaking of the Supreme Court, they found two more moons on Pluto.

49
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,046
Scott: apparently Isn't Pluto?

50
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:20,339
Scott: they don't even know if it's a planet or a moon or what?

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,432
Scott: There's nobody's decided how big you have to be to be a planet.

52
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:31,720
Rym: Basically what the news is is a tiny Rock that's far away from our planet has rocks a tiny rock floating around.

53
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,800
Rym: It might have two more tinier rocks floating around it that we couldn't see until recently.

54
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:48,532
Scott: Yeah So now this makes you wonder that like we can see like Jupiter sized planets at like very close stars How do we know they don't have like earth sized rocks around?

55
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:54,250
Scott: and we can't see if we can barely see rocks around Pluto These rocks that are infinitely farther away.

56
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,199
Scott: Well, not infinitely farther, but many many more times farther away.

57
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:00,030
Scott: Who knows what's going on out there?

58
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,062
Rym: Pluto was discovered in 1930?

59
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:04,016
Rym: Fairly long time ago.

60
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,309
Rym: Pluto's moon wasn't discovered till 1978 and Now in 2005 we discovered two smaller rocks.

61
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:18,372
Scott: Well in 2050 we should be discovering the Mountains of Pluto and the mountains on the moons of Pluto.

62
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,137
Rym: I don't think there any mountains on Pluto.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,966
Rym: No, I think Pluto is just a rock.

64
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:23,949
Scott: It's just smooth.

65
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:29,264
Rym: I don't think it's big enough to where you could qualify as mountain Must.

66
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:30,871
Scott: it can't be perfectly smooth.

67
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:32,760
Scott: It has to have some hills and craters and things.

68
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,419
Rym: Yes, because obviously I was trying to say that Pluto is perfectly smooth.

69
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:41,055
Rym: It is made of cheese and it has people like he's isn't perfectly smooth.

70
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:42,700
Rym: some cheese is well.

71
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,588
Rym: No, nothing's perfectly smooth.

72
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:47,640
Rym: It's made of atoms little quarks bouncing around.

73
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:51,180
Scott: Hey, they could all be crystalline in a perfect grid and that's smooth.

74
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:54,278
Rym: No Because it's the grid itself isn't smooth and there's gaps in it.

75
00:04:56,372 --> 00:05:00,109
Scott: It could be really cold and then they'll be really close together and smooth.

76
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:01,773
Rym: Okay.

77
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:05,090
Rym: Yeah, so I guess maybe a Bose Einstein condensate might be smooth.

78
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,780
Scott: So is a baby's ass Bose?

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,990
Scott: I'm condensate whatever.

80
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,703
Rym: Moving on Halloween, yeah, and uh, I didn't do anything this year.

81
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:21,207
Scott: Me neither.

82
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:22,813
Rym: I wanted to carve a pumpkin I didn't.

83
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:28,508
Rym: I was gonna go to the parade downtown Went to a j-rock concert instead.

84
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:31,782
Scott: So, you know, it really bothers me though.

85
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:35,310
Scott: Oh It's Halloween, all right.

86
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:41,085
Scott: It's a good holiday like the holiday like candy like scare and stuff like jumping out and going boo.

87
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:44,961
Scott: Right like mischief like costumes.

88
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:54,510
Scott: I Saw like three news stories today about people Think their ghosts are real and I had to link to Randy like four times.

89
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:57,579
Rym: I'll just point out that while I was in the city.

90
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:06,029
Rym: It's not really Halloween related, but I saw these ads For psychic detectives and this is on court TV court TV.

91
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:08,619
Scott: And is it a fictional show?

92
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,164
Rym: the subscript is.

93
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:11,730
Rym: it says psychic detectives?

94
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,081
Rym: This isn't based on a true story colon.

95
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,950
Rym: This is a true story.

96
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:20,863
Scott: Yeah, so we can sue them right for the false advertising.

97
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:22,650
Scott: Well, I guess it is a true story.

98
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:24,435
Scott: Whatever they show really happened.

99
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,281
Scott: The psychic part was just made up.

100
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:28,187
Rym: something like that something like that.

101
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:38,697
Rym: Randy should buy some commercial time on court TV, of course There's also a lot of people who are still believing in things like someone's gonna put razor blades in the apples They give to kids.

102
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:46,190
Scott: or you know, you know At least while that's crazy You could put a razor blade in Apple.

103
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,734
Rym: There's no way you could put a razor blade in an apple that I wouldn't see before you'd see it But you know what?

104
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:55,416
Scott: You're never gonna see a ghost ever Not a real one at least.

105
00:06:55,477 --> 00:07:00,074
Rym: Well, hey if I did I get a million bucks out of Randy sweet With those million bucks.

106
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:01,979
Scott: I wonder how many razor blades you could buy.

107
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,316
Scott: I Mean you could probably just buy a bunch of.

108
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:10,247
Scott: you really wanted to see children eat apples full of razor blades.

109
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:18,489
Scott: if you won the Million dollars you could just buy children be You can feed them apples with razor blades.

110
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:20,819
Rym: and Yeah, who's that?

111
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:29,829
Rym: Roman Polanski is a very famous pedophile who fled the game is pedophile because he fled the country and he's still out there.

112
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:31,737
Rym: They never got it.

113
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:32,742
Scott: Why don't they get him?

114
00:07:32,883 --> 00:07:33,546
Rym: because he's not.

115
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:35,633
Rym: he got away All right.

116
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:38,524
Scott: Now, how does razor blades and apples relate to pedophilia?

117
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:39,949
Rym: You want to do something to little kids?

118
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:42,702
Scott: Not sexual and I don't want to do it.

119
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:47,108
Scott: I was just suggesting it that whoever Was obviously going about it the wrong way.

120
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:58,330
Rym: Yeah, yeah The hours wondered like say someone actually was putting razor blades and apples and say somehow you didn't see the the razor blades sticking Out of the Apple or the hole in the Apple where the razor blade was shoved in.

121
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:01,259
Rym: Say they're a sicko and they like this sort of thing.

122
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:03,770
Rym: Like oh, I love the idea of a kid eating a razor blade in an Apple.

123
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:06,540
Rym: How would they see the kitty?

124
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:06,801
Rym: third?

125
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,530
Rym: How would they get any pleasure out of it?

126
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,450
Scott: Well, I imagine it would be a lot like the old man who tells you to get off his lawn.

127
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:18,289
Scott: I mean, he sees you get off his lawn, but he doesn't see you go home and cry to your mommy Even though he thinks about it and laughs.

128
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:31,575
Scott: So Bill Gates, he gave like a hajillion dollars to fight malaria a Jillian a yeah hundreds of millions something like 250 million Something by malaria of all things.

129
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:44,207
Scott: Well, the thing is if you actually look at the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation thingy They're always like we give money to fight the diseases that the poor people have instead of the rich people diseases like diabetes and such.

130
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:47,065
Scott: So malaria is a poor people disease.

131
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:47,730
Scott: It has a cure.

132
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,730
Scott: We just need to spend money to give the cure to people who have it and kill mosquitoes.

133
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:55,537
Scott: So it's pretty much a sure bet.

134
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:58,209
Scott: but I realized why he's doing this, huh?

135
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,429
Scott: See Apple gets in the news with their little iPod video.

136
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:02,974
Rym: Microsoft doesn't get the.

137
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:05,121
Scott: Google gets in the news doesn't do anything.

138
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:10,202
Scott: Google gets in the news with their googling Microsoft Vista.

139
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:11,309
Scott: it gets negative news.

140
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:16,969
Scott: So Bill Gates has to go and spend money to fight malaria to get some positive news for the Microsoft.

141
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:22,645
Scott: Notice how there's no positive news for any of their products services.

142
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:32,537
Rym: Ah I saw a thing talking about how Microsoft Office was good on like a Windows blog Somewhere written by a guy who works for Microsoft.

143
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:40,019
Scott: once there was a guy Who was using the Vista beta as his OS and he talks about they have the ribbon on all the programs.

144
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,748
Scott: now I don't know about the ribbon.

145
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:42,653
Scott: I never actually used it.

146
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:43,899
Scott: So I can't yeah me either.

147
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:46,959
Rym: Well, you know suppose it because I dumped the windows.

148
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,410
Scott: I'm done with that totally dumping the windows and you know what.

149
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,476
Scott: if the ribbon is any good someone will steal it and make it in for the Linux.

150
00:09:55,224 --> 00:09:56,158
Scott: So it's been an apple.

151
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:59,592
Scott: He sold a million videos in 20 days.

152
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:09,489
Scott: I Think it's catching on You know, and this is with two dollars a video For basically crap TV shows.

153
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,939
Scott: some other people would say they're not crap TV shows, but I say they're crap TV shows.

154
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:16,599
Rym: I agree that most of them are crap, but I like certain TV shows.

155
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:21,658
Scott: Well, there there are good TV shows, but none of them are available for $2 an episode from Apple.

156
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:22,240
Rym: No, they're not.

157
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,758
Rym: I see I can't get my eyes.

158
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:26,505
Scott: Yeah, it's a wonderful show.

159
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,874
Rym: I had a busy prick me with an AIDS infected needle.

160
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:30,299
Scott: Good luck with that.

161
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,157
Scott: But You know, imagine if they had.

162
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:39,209
Scott: you know Real deal, you know full-on everything.

163
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:43,360
Scott: just put on old things that aren't on TV anymore and charge 50 cents for them.

164
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,179
Scott: You're making zero dollars off of them.

165
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,159
Scott: Now you could be making hundreds of thousands of dollars off of them.

166
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,352
Rym: No Call that stuff in DVD box sets.

167
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:53,160
Rym: that cost a lot of money not everything.

168
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,880
Scott: There's still a lot of things that haven't made it to DVD box set.

169
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:57,265
Rym: Yeah, but a lot of things have.

170
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,970
Scott: a lot of things have.

171
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:01,700
Rym: but our box set of old crappy Hitchcock movies.

172
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:06,480
Scott: Yeah, but I mean that actually comes out to be cheaper than the downloading that box.

173
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,774
Scott: But like BBC is putting the Monty Python full things for download.

174
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:11,376
Rym: Yeah.

175
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:16,016
Scott: Yeah, you know Well, that was you got it for a present you wouldn't have bought.

176
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:18,846
Rym: it was so much money I would have bought it for the price they paid for it.

177
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:23,380
Rym: Yeah, they bought it at like Costco, which is like Sam.

178
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:24,960
Rym: They got it for nothing anyway.

179
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:30,500
Scott: anything else going on, uh There really wasn't much.

180
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,000
Rym: I mean I went to the city all weekend and I didn't really read the interwebs all weekend.

181
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:40,214
Rym: So I kind of missed out on whatever happened, but I did find something cool.

182
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,320
Rym: It's probably old but it's cool.

183
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:48,120
Rym: It's a website dedicated to spoiling things like movies and books and anime and whatever.

184
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:52,540
Scott: Oh, so I guess they could be useful but also incredibly painful.

185
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:53,985
Rym: Yeah, it's really useful.

186
00:11:54,025 --> 00:12:04,260
Rym: like I wanted to find out how a stupid show ended so I looked like oh so-and-so dies and then Marry, so hey if the show like other shows were like you see the ending but you still don't know what happened.

187
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,464
Scott: Does it explain those?

188
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:06,086
Rym: Yes.

189
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:06,527
Rym: Yes here.

190
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:07,490
Rym: I'll go into one.

191
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,554
Scott: Go to Evangelion.

192
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,139
Rym: I'm going into Donnie Darko.

193
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,367
Rym: Everyone's seen Donnie Darko.

194
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:13,834
Rym: All right, there's about.

195
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:15,000
Scott: this is spoiler.

196
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:17,808
Scott: Watch out.

197
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,060
Rym: All right, it describes an Extremely great detail.

198
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:31,079
Rym: It doesn't not only spoils it it Explains why what it's telling you spoils it and then explains in great detail the scenes that actually do the spoiling.

199
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,474
Scott: now Is this guy is this one guy writing all this or it's like a wiki?

200
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:35,900
Rym: or what is this like a wiki?

201
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,972
Rym: It acts like a wiki and it looks like a wiki.

202
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,199
Rym: I don't think it's actually a wiki.

203
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:42,031
Scott: People are people like editing it in or like.

204
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:54,153
Rym: it has some stubs and people are adding entries like there's one listing for every James Bond movie ever and it says Bonds right-hand man dies bond gets the girl another girl dies.

205
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:56,800
Rym: He doesn't die and the villain does die.

206
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,712
Scott: Awesome The coolest thing I saw today was the jack PC.

207
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:05,548
Rym: I Saw a picture of that thing.

208
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,978
Scott: So it's it's a PC.

209
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:08,665
Scott: But first there was three.

210
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,712
Scott: comm made the hub that you put in the wall.

211
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,036
Rym: Yep, and the switch.

212
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,046
Scott: Oh They made a switch also.

213
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,100
Rym: Yeah, they made the switch right after they made them.

214
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:21,688
Scott: Basically just you take your outlet out of your wall and you put this hub in there And you run network cable to it.

215
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:24,260
Scott: And well, there you go or you guys you could cut a hole in the wall.

216
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,348
Scott: Yeah, yeah, they made the jack PC.

217
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,496
Scott: now, which is just you cut a hole in the wall.

218
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:29,400
Scott: You put this computer.

219
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,068
Scott: It's you know, not so big.

220
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:32,334
Scott: it fits a hole in the wall.

221
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:37,389
Scott: It has a DVI Head headphone in and out microphone in I guess.

222
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,400
Scott: and then for USBs, huh?

223
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,339
Scott: If you just plug the DVI cable to a monitor you plug in a keyboard and mouse of USB.

224
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,158
Scott: You have two USBs left push a button on it a light turns on and you have a computer.

225
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:54,856
Rym: I take it it's not that powerful considering, you know heating and it has a.

226
00:13:55,902 --> 00:14:06,379
Scott: I think it had a very very low power Embedded AMD type processor, which is actually still good enough and that one problem with it is it comes with the windows CE.

227
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,079
Rym: ah, ah

228
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:31,138
Scott: The windows CE ah, but um, I imagine if you were mad slick you could either a Switch up the OS that's in the flash by taking the flash out reflashing it putting it something else on there like a custom Linux kernel or if you were extra slick you could plug in like a USB hard drive to the USB hole and get it to boot off of it.

229
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:31,861
Scott: It's.

230
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:38,066
Rym: you know, I've got this USB hard drive sitting there on the floor Defeating the purpose of having.

231
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:42,340
Scott: it's a lot easier than having a laptop with a power cable and then a DVI cable.

232
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:46,099
Rym: Good for our media box in the living room hooked up to the TV.

233
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,890
Scott: Yeah, if you use it like dude check this out.

234
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,280
Scott: the only oh it didn't have a network thing was the other problem.

235
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,809
Rym: There's got to be some sort of network thing.

236
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:57,688
Scott: Well, no, you'd have to use like a USB Like network card or something.

237
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,512
Rym: So I didn't make one.

238
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,340
Scott: I didn't see a network thing on it.

239
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,682
Scott: There might be an Ethernet hole in the back of it Like you.

240
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,337
Scott: just put you have the Ethernet in the wall.

241
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:04,640
Rym: make a lot.

242
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,040
Scott: It could be wireless built in could be wireless built in it and see it though and I didn't see words saying it.

243
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:09,746
Scott: But it could.

244
00:15:10,473 --> 00:15:13,500
Scott: if it had that You just wouldn't need a PC in your living room.

245
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:27,259
Scott: you plug this thing in and you just have all the T Boeing myth TVing done by another computer and you just use the Windows CE thingy to do a connect up some sort of Samba share maybe snacks forward like a thin client.

246
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:41,339
Rym: So, uh, we realized that it's hard for us to talk about science and tech even though we made it a bit Because All our good banner comes from us arguing with each other or disagreeing or saying things the other person doesn't know.

247
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:43,605
Rym: We agree on science.

248
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:47,140
Scott: I don't see how you could disagree on science seeing is it it's?

249
00:15:48,420 --> 00:16:01,795
Rym: Yes, I mean if there's evidence that says X is true and we both see that evidence then we both agree that X is true and Our caught podcast basically goes hey, uh, so evolution is pretty much a fact, isn't it?

250
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:02,718
Rym: Yep.

251
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:05,184
Scott: Yeah Hey, you see that chair?

252
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:05,807
Scott: Yeah.

253
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:06,609
Scott: What color is it?

254
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,135
Rym: Kind of bluish blue?

255
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:08,536
Scott: Yep.

256
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:08,958
Rym: Yep.

257
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:16,100
Scott: Yep See now if I had said green, it's not really that entertaining because well, I'm just wrong.

258
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,983
Rym: Yeah, I would say no it's blue and then I'd post a picture on the blog and then the world would go Oh, it's blue.

259
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:29,619
Rym: Maybe Colin or colorblind friend wouldn't but everyone else Sucks to be colorblind Especially if you like German board games.

260
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,445
Scott: Yeah, especially the camel game.

261
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:37,816
Rym: oh god, it's like four different colors like four different pastel camels, it's a good game.

262
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,778
Scott: Oh Hiccups, what do you do about those in a podcast you punch someone squarely in the solar plexus?

263
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:48,504
Rym: No It'll care him.

264
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:50,071
Rym: I guarantee you won't be hiccuping anymore.

265
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,040
Scott: You know, actually science says differently.

266
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:54,719
Rym: Why do you science say?

267
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:58,520
Scott: Science says that hitting someone in the solar plexus does not care the hiccups.

268
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:01,490
Rym: Um, I believe we could conduct an experiment to find out.

269
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:02,293
Scott: Well, you know what?

270
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,339
Scott: I don't really have any hiccups anymore.

271
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:06,248
Rym: We'll see about that.

272
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,174
Scott: We will see.

273
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:07,717
Scott: but you know what?

274
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,055
Scott: science.

275
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:21,150
Rym: but I mean Despite the fact that you can't really disagree on science unless the evidence isn't clear enough Like say there's not enough evidence for something.

276
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,357
Scott: You don't have a theory yet.

277
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,440
Scott: You still have a hypothesis.

278
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:28,315
Scott: Yeah, so if you have a hypothesis and I have a hypothesis.

279
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:39,235
Scott: I like to say hypothesis Yep, the most and there's no experiments conducted yet that are conclusive then Who's to say?

280
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:42,009
Rym: Yeah, and we both seek out more evidence.

281
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:52,834
Scott: See, you know how you can disagree on science if one of the people you're discussing science with doesn't understand science Yep, or if someone is stupid You know.

282
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:59,400
Rym: if you don't understand science it's the same as being stupid Yeah, or if someone is misinformed, but that gets fixed immediately when you get the facts out.

283
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:12,654
Rym: The part of the problem is some people will disagree on the facts and then therefore they can't agree on a conclusion because they've got the facts wrong to begin with and Won't look at actual evidence showing them.

284
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,114
Rym: They're wrong.

285
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:16,420
Scott: The only way to disagree on facts is number one.

286
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:27,399
Scott: if you The place where you're getting your facts from like if it was a study you might claim that the study was done improperly Yep, or two.

287
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:29,209
Scott: you just don't like it and you're denying it.

288
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:31,795
Rym: I think two is the biggest part of this.

289
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,118
Scott: two is a pretty big problem.

290
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:44,749
Rym: I mean America's still debating evolution and every other country in the world is laughing hysterically I mean during the original scopes monkey trial so long ago.

291
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,758
Rym: I mean we're talking before World War two.

292
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:58,209
Rym: even back then the French newspapers had headlines like Americans debating facts or Americans are stupid or I could pull out some actual headlines if you wanted me to.

293
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:01,049
Rym: They were making fun of us then.

294
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:12,229
Scott: Yeah, the one thing I heard from another country was this British guy and he was basically saying how in Britain they're paying real close attention to it Because they're worried that it'll come over there next.

295
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:18,466
Scott: Like if they win in America that next they'll be coming to Britain trying to win and they don't want that.

296
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:21,809
Rym: a bunch of Australians Who are pro intelligent design got together?

297
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,746
Rym: because they saw how well it was going in America and they decided they were gonna push it in Australia.

298
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:35,270
Rym: because the I Forget exactly how their government is set up, but like their equivalent parliamentary I think yeah, but I mean like the different departments or whatever.

299
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:50,160
Rym: But their equivalent of like a minister of education is kind of pro intelligent design Supposedly and These people are like, yeah ID ID go and the government put a blanket statement out saying Intelligent design is not science.

300
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:51,247
Rym: It will never be considered.

301
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:54,675
Scott: go away cool Good for Australia.

302
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,263
Rym: Yeah, too bad.

303
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:57,228
Rym: We can't get some of that here.

304
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:02,595
Scott: Yeah thing is though Australia is like half awesome Half crap.

305
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:05,649
Rym: Yeah, they're real big on the DRM and things like that.

306
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,609
Scott: You get Nintendo games like years after they come out.

307
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,684
Scott: Yeah, their gameboy advances don't work with other people's gameboy advances.

308
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:17,278
Scott: from what I heard from an Australian guy I don't know how true it is, but there's an outback.

309
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,864
Scott: There is an outback.

310
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:20,530
Scott: There are rough-and-tough people out there.

311
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,617
Scott: There's great sports.

312
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,634
Scott: Yep, it's clean It's Play pleasant to live in.

313
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:29,084
Rym: the water's cancer a lot of skin cancer.

314
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,610
Scott: You got to watch us just cuz the Sun.

315
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,562
Rym: Yeah, you know, but my grandparents tried to move there actually.

316
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:35,630
Scott: Well, you need mad skills to move there.

317
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,934
Rym: Yeah, they won't just let you move in.

318
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:44,741
Rym: you have to prove that you have a skill that they need and that you'll become gainfully Employed and you don't have any diseases and a whole bunch of others.

319
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:46,890
Scott: I actually heard a guy talking today about moving to Australia.

320
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:48,742
Scott: He's like it doesn't matter how much money you have.

321
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:49,990
Scott: You need to have a special something.

322
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,245
Scott: Yeah, be like a rocket scientist or something in because they respect science there.

323
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:59,659
Scott: Yeah, he us As long as you're not Mexican They'll let you in.

324
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,897
Scott: it seems Oh Arabs they don't the Arabs in it.

325
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:03,841
Rym: Yeah, I don't like them so much.

326
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,450
Rym: They don't like people who look different.

327
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:09,821
Rym: Yeah, so they're okay with a lot of the white aliens because they look the same.

328
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:16,177
Scott: Oh, no, British people are coming to our board Canadians, oh, they don't like Canadians though.

329
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:18,447
Scott: They just don't know you're Canadian till you say something.

330
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:22,373
Scott: Hey Canada's cool, though.

331
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:23,236
Rym: I love Canada.

332
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:23,919
Scott: It's just cold.

333
00:21:24,502 --> 00:21:24,763
Rym: Yeah.

334
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:26,209
Rym: Now we need a passport to go there.

335
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,951
Scott: Thanks.

336
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:28,899
Scott: We've been watching some do right.

337
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:29,742
Scott: I love that.

338
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:31,970
Rym: I don't like Dudley do right so much.

339
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,330
Rym: I was more a fan of the fractured fairy tales, right?

340
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,093
Scott: Where does it good?

341
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:39,530
Scott: but you gotta you gotta love the snidely whiplash that the one that I just watched.

342
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:43,485
Scott: It's so great snidely whiplash is like foreclosing on these mortgages.

343
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:45,097
Scott: Oh my god.

344
00:21:46,178 --> 00:21:48,210
Scott: Yeah You don't understand.

345
00:21:50,152 --> 00:21:52,087
Rym: So, uh, yeah, we got on a tangent.

346
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:57,067
Rym: I mean The point is just that we can't argue about science here because there's no argument.

347
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:03,120
Rym: There's either something's true or something isn't or we don't know and There's no way we could ever disagree.

348
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,810
Rym: So we can't come up with any way to get banter.

349
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:09,509
Scott: We could probably try to get some side tech guests who?

350
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:11,570
Scott: You know, maybe know some science.

351
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:17,009
Scott: We don't know or are dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb and they don't understand what we just said.

352
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:18,234
Scott: They don't under.

353
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:19,017
Scott: so then we can.

354
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,502
Scott: you know science them.

355
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:27,727
Rym: or another angle we could take is We could go the informative route and pick a topic that we know a lot about and talk about it.

356
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:30,673
Rym: I don't know how Unboring that would be.

357
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:38,692
Scott: yeah, the thing is also is that we're not experts in any particular area other than Computing.

358
00:22:39,294 --> 00:22:41,260
Scott: Yeah, at least as far as science.

359
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,190
Scott: I mean we know more science than the average person.

360
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:46,661
Scott: You don't know enough about any one science.

361
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:51,043
Scott: Like we couldn't give you a lecture on Particle physics.

362
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:58,350
Rym: Yeah About quantum physics, but I couldn't talk about it in a way that there are other people who could talk about it better.

363
00:22:58,531 --> 00:23:00,866
Scott: I could talk about quantum physics for maybe about 10-15 minutes.

364
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,238
Scott: I just tell you everything I knew about it and that would be it and that wouldn't be Exciting or anything.

365
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,849
Rym: wasn't there a time when you didn't believe in atoms?

366
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:24,001
Scott: Hey, you know that was before you could see him and I didn't say, you know, all I saying that was that Atoms were a model for describing the particles that made up everything and we knew that everything was made of smaller bits But we didn't know for sure that it was.

367
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,756
Scott: it was Protons neutrons and electrons.

368
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:30,627
Rym: Well, actually, yeah, we did before we saw him.

369
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:31,290
Scott: How did you know?

370
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,138
Scott: It was only a model that worked.

371
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:33,621
Scott: It wasn't.

372
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:35,008
Scott: no it was a model.

373
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:41,546
Rym: it That sort of physics as opposed to quantum physics didn't come out of the model.

374
00:23:41,707 --> 00:23:45,480
Rym: and then discovery Ideology it came out of the.

375
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:49,175
Rym: we discovered these particles Because we could see them cut.

376
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:52,804
Rym: we could detect them coming out of things when certain reactions happen.

377
00:23:53,385 --> 00:24:03,768
Rym: if you detect particles, you don't You know, it's it's like it really you can't ever see an atom because it's you know Photons bouncing off of something is how you see.

378
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:06,814
Scott: Yeah, it's always a problem.

379
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:07,817
Scott: We should try to fix that.

380
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:09,561
Rym: That's impossible to fix.

381
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:12,710
Rym: You can't see you can only represent based on data.

382
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:15,160
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it's like.

383
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:16,890
Scott: alright, we keep trying to use vision.

384
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,090
Scott: We keep trying to detect things by bouncing a photon off of it and then detecting.

385
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,355
Rym: No, we don't do that at all.

386
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:25,189
Rym: We try to detect it using other much more advanced sensory apparatuses.

387
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:26,897
Scott: Yeah, but how do those things work?

388
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:30,070
Scott: I've always heard about these sensory things they use in accelerators.

389
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,578
Scott: I've never actually heard about how they work or anything.

390
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:36,170
Rym: They're all very very different like a neutrino detector.

391
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:37,980
Rym: One way to do it is.

392
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,827
Rym: they have a big tank of water Pure pure pure water and if a neutrino goes through the water the odds are it'll hit one of those water molecules.

393
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:45,689
Rym: make us a flash.

394
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:47,555
Scott: They're actually flashes.

395
00:24:47,575 --> 00:24:48,560
Scott: like you can see it flash.

396
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:49,022
Rym: Yeah.

397
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:50,227
Scott: Wow, that's pretty cool.

398
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,220
Scott: or Just look at this big tank of water and I'll see.

399
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,450
Rym: like I don't know if humans can see it.

400
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,657
Rym: I think they need a camera to see it.

401
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:58,366
Rym: I don't know how fast they're or powerful.

402
00:24:58,387 --> 00:25:01,576
Rym: These flashes are Much cooler.

403
00:25:01,596 --> 00:25:06,187
Scott: if it was a real like a big like a flash bulb You like you take pictures?

404
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,570
Rym: Like when they discovered positrons and all that sort of stuff electrons and egotrons.

405
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:19,490
Rym: They would set up photographic plates and then they could see the spirals as the particles flew away from the reaction.

406
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:24,250
Scott: Remember say but I mean, how do you think of this to begin with?

407
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:26,467
Rym: Science.

408
00:25:27,432 --> 00:25:28,860
Scott: But I mean who thinks of that.

409
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:30,490
Scott: Hey, I'm smashing atoms here.

410
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:34,829
Scott: Let me um put a big tank of water next to it and see if anything happens in the water.

411
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,676
Rym: This was more huh?

412
00:25:36,817 --> 00:25:40,430
Rym: Every time I collide these two atoms it a certain result happens.

413
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:45,170
Scott: I wonder what's happening, but how do you detect the result and know what it was before they made the detector?

414
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:49,149
Rym: Because they had other detectors that detected larger scale events.

415
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:54,611
Rym: Like if you run two atoms into each other, you can detect that energy is released Huh?

416
00:25:54,632 --> 00:25:55,635
Rym: Yeah was released.

417
00:25:56,318 --> 00:25:57,362
Rym: Where did the atoms go?

418
00:25:57,382 --> 00:26:07,210
Rym: and then you set up a thing like well I'll put this thing around it where if a if an atom hits it It'll react in a certain way and I know it reacts that way because I fired atoms at it and reacts that way.

419
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:08,478
Rym: So I'll put it around.

420
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:10,089
Rym: so I'll see if the atoms bounce off each other.

421
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:12,237
Rym: Hey, they had never detected an atom.

422
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:13,661
Rym: the atoms must have disappeared.

423
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:16,370
Rym: So what they turn into where they got energy?

424
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:19,350
Rym: Maybe actually they turn into energy and particle.

425
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:25,680
Scott: Well, you do math to figure out how much of it turned into energy and then the rest obviously did not Something like that.

426
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:29,460
Scott: Yeah Cuz you know equals MC squared and such.

427
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,126
Rym: that's actually not the equation.

428
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:32,330
Scott: I know it has a lot.

429
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,499
Scott: well, it's actually this the the.

430
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:38,293
Scott: there's another version where it's like M equals No, no, no.

431
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:45,594
Rym: over equals MC squares is is a representation but is a simplification of the actual equation Significantly more complex.

432
00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:46,416
Scott: Well, there is.

433
00:26:46,576 --> 00:26:58,865
Rym: the whole thing is it's a large theory of relativity, which has many equations encompassing it equals MC squared is just saying that either time or Speed of light has to be constant.

434
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:03,387
Rym: Einstein made the speed of light constant because that made his equations.

435
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:10,379
Rym: Awesome he could have done it the other way and it would have worked just as well, but he chose this way and He was smarter than I was.

436
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:16,009
Scott: so what it really says is that You know matter it has a whole lot of energy in it.

437
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:22,770
Rym: No, it more just says that mass is energy it is energy, but it is a whole lot.

438
00:27:23,173 --> 00:27:31,128
Scott: In fact, it's C squared a whole lot Yeah, which in a grand scale isn't and a grand scale isn't that much but on a human scale?

439
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:31,670
Scott: That's a lot.

440
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:39,396
Scott: I mean, you know if you got all the energy out of like a piece of wood all of it all C squared of it It's a lot of energy.

441
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:43,912
Scott: you could pry power a city on that for like Weak.

442
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:45,819
Rym: Yeah, but you know keep in mind entropy.

443
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,024
Rym: You really can't get that energy.

444
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:48,490
Scott: Yeah, and it sucks.

445
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:49,855
Rym: You know the whole thermo.

446
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:52,586
Scott: does that something we can do about science if we can't argue about it.

447
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:53,590
Scott: We can complain about it.

448
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:55,844
Rym: Yeah, stupid thermodynamics.

449
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,472
Scott: I mean Bringing.

450
00:27:57,512 --> 00:28:00,661
Scott: if I burn a piece of wood, I can't get all the heat.

451
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,045
Scott: I mean, come on.

452
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:02,687
Scott: I burnt it.

453
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:03,890
Scott: It's all mine.

454
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:04,528
Scott: Where's it going?

455
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:06,555
Scott: It's my wood.

456
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:12,493
Scott: friggin laws of physics stealing my fire Lisa in this house.

457
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:14,179
Rym: We follow the laws of thermodynamics.

458
00:28:15,382 --> 00:28:16,727
Scott: Oh, I forget the quote.

459
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,922
Rym: Oh Busted own food, whatever.

460
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:23,450
Scott: I know it's from the Simpsons.

461
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,360
Scott: Yeah, there was a whole thing recently about math in the Simpsons.

462
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,527
Scott: how hard it was for them to get these math jokes in.

463
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:38,088
Rym: because I Remember the first one remember way way back when Bart went to the genius school and there was the rdr.

464
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:40,137
Rym: rdr Already ha ha.

465
00:28:40,237 --> 00:28:40,438
Rym: Yeah.

466
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,730
Rym: Well, I remember laughing at that.

467
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,090
Rym: I was real little when I saw that episode and then I took AP physics and an AP physics.

468
00:28:48,551 --> 00:29:03,434
Rym: we were calculating a Gaussian surface and we were calculating the Gaussian surface of a doughnut shaped objects and then I realized that the operative part of the equation we were using was rdrr and I realized

469
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:03,675
Scott: up

470
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:10,867
Rym: that it was the shape of a doughnut and I laughed for like At least a minute straight and everyone's looking at me

471
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:12,415
Scott: Don't?

472
00:29:12,455 --> 00:29:13,607
Rym: I said rdrr?

473
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,878
Rym: Hardy ha ha and they're all geeks.

474
00:29:17,918 --> 00:29:19,002
Rym: they all got it and then we didn't.

475
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:21,029
Rym: we just stopped working all day and laughed about that.

476
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:22,928
Rym: Yeah, it was great.

477
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:54,900
Scott: there was a. I don't know this for a hundred percent, but there was a tale of the of the Friends went to Fairfield High School and they told a story that there was a teacher there and He was a math teacher and when his problems arrived at an answer involving the number 69 he would put a tally above the board and Yeah that's That's not as funny as rdrr.

478
00:29:55,222 --> 00:29:56,770
Scott: No, but it's definitely stranger.

479
00:29:57,952 --> 00:30:09,010
Rym: Yeah, actually my calculus teacher in tenth grade He pretty much He said okay, I think more times than he said any other word including definite and indefinite articles.

480
00:30:09,713 --> 00:30:13,269
Scott: Oh, I hate it, especially when there's good teachers that say words over and over.

481
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:19,324
Scott: Yeah, like I had one teacher who would always say in essence In essence in essence in essence everything was in essence.

482
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:22,157
Scott: I was like so nothing's for real It's only in essence the same.

483
00:30:22,177 --> 00:30:28,555
Rym: I had an English teacher who said quintessential at least twice a day Twice a day isn't so bad.

484
00:30:28,836 --> 00:30:30,621
Scott: I'm talking about like constantly.

485
00:30:30,721 --> 00:30:37,030
Rym: the MK guy was terrible because he'd say it like, okay, and He'd expect some sort of response like yeah, and then he'd keep going.

486
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:41,423
Rym: But if no one said anything he would quite literally stand in front of the classroom going.

487
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:41,804
Rym: Okay.

488
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:42,586
Rym: Okay.

489
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:48,169
Rym: All right Okay, okay, and then he'd move on like he'd get stuck.

490
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:51,477
Scott: Some people got these problems.

491
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,466
Scott: Yeah, can science explain them?

492
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:55,834
Scott: probably Maybe they should.

493
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:57,398
Rym: we should get a scientist in.

494
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,731
Scott: you know, I'm actually pretty sure that you know, some of those problems like ADD and such Like.

495
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:11,901
Scott: I'm not a super expert, but at least from the few things I've read there's no Gene for ADD.

496
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:15,359
Scott: There's no virus No bacteria.

497
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,992
Scott: There's no Chemical.

498
00:31:18,012 --> 00:31:24,170
Rym: I think the problem here is more simply that I believe ADD is something that does exist and can affect people.

499
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:31,903
Rym: I do believe however that it is Wildly over diagnosed that many people who are told they have ADD are just you know kids.

500
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:49,508
Rym: Oh my god, ah Maybe if we let him play on proper playgrounds Yeah, yeah cuz I mean when we were kids we were already complaining about the decline of the playground because when we were kids They were taking away the seesaws and they're taking away the merry-go-rounds.

501
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,890
Scott: Actually, you know, I had a pretty good at my elementary school.

502
00:31:53,151 --> 00:32:03,734
Scott: There was there were three playgrounds and when I was in kindergarten There was the old playground and then there was the the big toys which is the new playground.

503
00:32:04,235 --> 00:32:18,242
Scott: the old playground consisted of some old style swings two long chains of the rubber seat a sandbox a spinny thing Two wooden splintery seesaws of metal handles.

504
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,070
Scott: Ooh and this big square tower thing.

505
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:24,390
Scott: It was a square tower and you climbed up it various ways.

506
00:32:24,472 --> 00:32:28,370
Scott: It's just big Frickin tall rectangle structure at the top.

507
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,049
Scott: You could stand up there and those are railing and there was a slide from up there to get down.

508
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:34,424
Scott: This thing was like at least 10 feet tall.

509
00:32:34,444 --> 00:32:34,928
Scott: It's pretty tall.

510
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:46,790
Scott: then the big toys is a big wooden thing and they had the the tires and The tube and a swirly plastic slide and some chains to climb up in those plastic.

511
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:52,307
Rym: Worst things ever because the plastic slide was fun and we got a Van de Graaff generator.

512
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:53,270
Rym: you'd go down that thing.

513
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:54,256
Scott: Oh, yeah.

514
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,770
Scott: Oh, yeah, but they were still fun to go down.

515
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:04,710
Rym: but one time I got I've slid down one and I went to stand up and I brushed my arm against a little like Metal thing like a little screw and it shocked my arm so hard.

516
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,290
Rym: My arm was dumb and I went crying to my mom and I couldn't explain what happened.

517
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:12,205
Scott: Yeah, but when we were little kids the little the swirly yellow slide was still pretty good.

518
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:20,616
Scott: now as big kids We need the long metal slides to get any fun or the carny slides But they're all going away there.

519
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:22,122
Rym: I mean think about it when we were kids.

520
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:26,156
Rym: They were taking away the seesaws and all that stuff I saw a few days ago.

521
00:33:26,477 --> 00:33:29,170
Rym: They're taking away swings now because swings are too dangerous.

522
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:33,685
Scott: So if there's gonna be no moving parts, what's?

523
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:34,348
Scott: what's the fun?

524
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:34,730
Scott: You could just.

525
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:38,863
Rym: They're also taking away sandboxes because animals might do things in them.

526
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:44,125
Scott: You could use that white sand And Animals might do things.

527
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,778
Scott: They might just pee on the kids.

528
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:50,465
Rym: I've seen kids peeing on stuff.

529
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:52,834
Scott: so oh my god I remember nursery school.

530
00:33:52,854 --> 00:34:03,157
Scott: Some kid was peeing in the back of the nursery school playground, and I told her oh one time When I was in second grade You know, we're in a Catholic school.

531
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:04,622
Rym: There was this kid named Pierre.

532
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,167
Rym: He had pretty French.

533
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:07,010
Rym: No, he was not French.

534
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:08,333
Scott: Why was his name Pierre?

535
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:09,418
Rym: His name was Pierre.

536
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:11,304
Scott: What the hell are those parents thinking?

537
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:17,052
Rym: So anyway, one day Kids gonna get picked on and he just peed Even glass?

538
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:19,739
Rym: He just sat there and he just unzipped and peed.

539
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,103
Scott: Wait, he unzipped?

540
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:22,146
Rym: He unzipped and peed.

541
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,570
Rym: He was sitting in his desk and he just peed.

542
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:25,033
Scott: Where'd he peed?

543
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:25,876
Scott: Did he just go on the floor?

544
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:26,478
Rym: Just went on.

545
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:30,005
Rym: the floor started because the classroom was kind of slanted and started making his way toward the front of the room.

546
00:34:30,888 --> 00:34:38,284
Rym: And Who's a nun looks and says who's got a drink and no one says anything.

547
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:42,103
Rym: and then everyone's looking and we all real Everyone realizes at this point.

548
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:42,688
Rym: What is happening?

549
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:46,482
Scott: I never heard this story and no one wants to react to it.

550
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:47,946
Rym: cuz no one's sure what to do.

551
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:49,010
Rym: We're all second graders.

552
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:51,399
Rym: We didn't even think to laugh cuz this was just too weird.

553
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,282
Scott: second grade.

554
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:52,884
Scott: Holy crap.

555
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,607
Scott: I can grade.

556
00:34:53,706 --> 00:34:54,370
Scott: Holy crap.

557
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:00,745
Rym: And it was you know, this was back before, you know would have been a biohazard because you know wasn't.

558
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:03,139
Scott: it's not a biohazard It's sterile.

559
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:07,130
Rym: It's sterile If you get a tooth pulled by the dentist.

560
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,406
Rym: You're not allowed to take it home in a lot of places because it's a biohazard.

561
00:35:10,647 --> 00:35:11,190
Scott: I took it home.

562
00:35:11,454 --> 00:35:12,248
Rym: So, you know what the nun did?

563
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,530
Rym: She made him get some paper towels and clean up his pee and then we went back on with the lesson.

564
00:35:18,211 --> 00:35:18,934
Scott: Sounds about right.

565
00:35:19,135 --> 00:35:21,986
Rym: Yeah, she hit him too with the ruler a couple times.

566
00:35:22,026 --> 00:35:22,850
Scott: That's not so right.

567
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:24,114
Rym: I was a college school.

568
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:24,476
Rym: They hit us.

569
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:25,218
Rym: They hit me a lot.

570
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,443
Rym: Cuz I was smart ass.

571
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:27,145
Scott: I would hit back.

572
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:29,149
Rym: I Didn't hit back.

573
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,572
Scott: I would hit back Cuz.

574
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:36,049
Rym: I'd always ask questions about science and they give me God answers and I'd ask for science answers and then they hit me.

575
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:38,483
Scott: I always read stories you ever read.

576
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:39,549
Scott: they caged the animals at night.

577
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,550
Scott: No, it's basically this guy's autobiography of his childhood.

578
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,878
Scott: This is sequel and it's actually pretty sad.

579
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:56,382
Scott: cuz like his mom is all screwed up in traction all the time And his brothers don't care for him and he's always in like You know foster houses and things and it's terrible.

580
00:35:56,542 --> 00:36:02,968
Scott: and you know, his life pretty much sucked as a child Uh-huh, and he came to my middle school once and told us about it after he read it and he cried.

581
00:36:03,048 --> 00:36:07,067
Scott: whatever You know put on a show I think but you know, it's true.

582
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:07,730
Scott: basically.

583
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:14,989
Scott: Well, one of the things is he's always in Catholic places where nuns would hit him a lot You know and I was always just like you never hit back.

584
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:18,609
Scott: You can't really you know, I get you get my sympathy for some stuff, but not for that.

585
00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:23,670
Rym: Yeah, it's hard to hit back cuz remember when you're when you're in second grade, you're a little kid.

586
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,417
Rym: So those nuns are tall.

587
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,803
Rym: They're strong.

588
00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:28,230
Rym: They're stronger than your old ladies.

589
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,618
Rym: Nah, they weren't all old ladies.

590
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:32,950
Scott: If you push one over they'll break their hip and you win.

591
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:34,737
Rym: Actually, some of them were pretty young.

592
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:35,881
Scott: if they're young.

593
00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:36,905
Scott: Why are they hitting kids?

594
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,354
Scott: They're not mean old ladies They're mean nuns.

595
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:41,402
Scott: You're mean and young none.

596
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:44,733
Rym: There was one real nice none who gave me some gerbils Gerbils.

597
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:46,509
Rym: Yeah, she had gerbils and she gave me a couple.

598
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:53,389
Scott: I know could you I can't imagine like like a 20 30 year old nun hitting kids.

599
00:36:54,552 --> 00:36:57,450
Rym: Yeah one nun she was old, but she used a metal ruler.

600
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:00,526
Rym: Everyone else used wooden rulers and regime with that metal ruler.

601
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:01,350
Rym: That was endgame.

602
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:03,741
Scott: Maybe it's because she was so old.

603
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:05,129
Scott: She needed the metal one to.

604
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:07,095
Scott: You know spice it up.

605
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:10,389
Rym: I only ever saw her actually hit a kid once and the kid kind of deserved it.

606
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:19,287
Scott: You know kids do deserve a hitting sometimes But I don't think that you know, I don't think that's not should be doling it out.

607
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:24,890
Scott: Yeah You know, actually, you know, the Singapore hitting is a little too hard.

608
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:35,058
Rym: I'm kind of an advocate of caning because the more I see people doing stupid things It'd be a great way to solve problems.

609
00:37:35,098 --> 00:37:44,742
Scott: if someone was stupid if you just whacked him and said hey no See the thing is it's like it's not really cruel or unusual I mean the caning they do is a little cruel because a little too much.

610
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:54,418
Scott: but seriously if someone Let's say someone robbed a convenience store instead of locking them up in prison where they'll come out and just you know Not change their mind or anything

611
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:57,410
Rym: or if anything they'll learn how to rob one better from the people who are yeah

612
00:37:57,571 --> 00:38:01,958
Scott: You just whack them right just not caning.

613
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:11,409
Scott: but like Whipping or something something like between spanking and caning or just humiliate him just a good spanking Spanking's good.

614
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:14,578
Scott: The judge himself does it with a giant paddle.

615
00:38:14,618 --> 00:38:18,290
Scott: a paddle paddling paddling is good paddling of the swollen ass.

616
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:20,862
Scott: That's that's how we get him great.

617
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,189
Scott: It'll be so much cheaper.

618
00:38:23,411 --> 00:38:29,810
Rym: You know and people why this won't happen because we do have the whole, you know prison industrial complex going in the u.s.

619
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,657
Scott: Now it is but the prison doesn't make us money.

620
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:32,601
Scott: It loses us money.

621
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:37,198
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is the prison exists The prison system is huge.

622
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:39,509
Rym: Yeah, and a lot of people work for it.

623
00:38:40,212 --> 00:38:43,726
Rym: Everyone who works for the prison system has a vested interest in what we'll be.

624
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:46,497
Scott: still need prisons I mean for like crazy murders.

625
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:49,990
Rym: we do you realize how many people are incarcerated in the United States?

626
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,062
Rym: We have one of the highest per capita rates.

627
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:53,149
Scott: I think the highest.

628
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:58,710
Rym: Yeah, we have more people in prison per capita than China then a communist oppressive China.

629
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,298
Scott: We have more than Australia, which was a prison colony.

630
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,806
Rym: Well, isn't Australia a hundred percent.

631
00:39:03,826 --> 00:39:10,607
Scott: Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah Even Though we want to go there and they just don't let us.

632
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:18,117
Rym: you know I think we got a topic for a Friday coming up the prison industrial complex prison industrial complex because it's a something I'm we totally lost science.

633
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,690
Rym: Yeah, we lost science, but we couldn't talk about science.

634
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,430
Rym: We'll have to come up with a way to talk science.

635
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:29,850
Scott: I think we do a problem of Microphone close to the mouth a little less far from the mouth and you can see it on the wave getting bigger and smaller.

636
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,304
Rym: Well, we'll see if anyone complains when they listen to this.

637
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:33,410
Scott: I'm sure they will.

638
00:39:33,752 --> 00:39:35,218
Rym: Anyone still listening this far into it?

639
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:36,525
Rym: because we got on off on a tangent.

640
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:42,624
Rym: Yeah Hey Alex Pete if you hear this right now, it's no good.

641
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:43,366
Rym: Say something.

642
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:44,509
Scott: That's no good.

643
00:39:45,694 --> 00:39:46,198
Rym: We won't do that.

644
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:47,186
Rym: We won't make a habit of that.

645
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:51,060
Rym: but This podcast kind of went off on a crazy tangent.

646
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:56,709
Rym: We went from science to a kid peeing to prison industrial complex.

647
00:39:57,811 --> 00:40:02,350
Scott: Yeah, I think tomorrow and the next day will be a lot better though because we can argue about things.

648
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:04,507
Rym: I like games you don't like you like anime.

649
00:40:04,547 --> 00:40:04,688
Rym: what?

650
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:15,705
Scott: hey maybe we should you know pick something else or we can talk about like it and not liking because it's really the only room for Any real discussion unless we made an informative Monday night like today.

651
00:40:15,766 --> 00:40:21,850
Rym: This is how to Build a Linux box or this is how to use jabber properly.

652
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:25,396
Scott: Yeah, I just think that might be a little boring.

653
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:28,085
Scott: It sounds almost like a separate podcast we should do.

654
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:33,223
Scott: Yeah Let's get some suggestions from people we know.

655
00:40:33,243 --> 00:40:34,410
Rym: yeah, what do you want to hear?

656
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,786
Rym: What should we add other than sci-tech because we don't have so much sci-tech.

657
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:46,950
Rym: Anyway, that was GeekNights.

658
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:49,099

659
00:40:49,603 --> 00:40:51,620
