00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,067
Rym: It's Wednesday December 21st, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:18,169
Rym: tonight We talk about anime big o2 and space symphony my town.

3
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:20,947
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:32,101
Rym: So today at work one of my co-workers Came into my office with a box of some sort of card like a card for a computer And they looked real old.

5
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:37,505
Rym: and he looked at me And he asked me what they were and I didn't know and they were kind of weird.

6
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:45,373
Rym: there were these large like super large before the days of PCI or EISA and There were two cards.

7
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:50,086
Rym: They were connected by this ribbon cable between the two and they had a coax coming out of them.

8
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,508
Rym: and then another co-worker appeared and he's like oh, that's token bus.

9
00:00:54,709 --> 00:01:04,549
Rym: and Finally a piece of legendary computing that I never really understood came together And I finally for the first time saw an actual token bus.

10
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:06,137
Scott: Not a token ring.

11
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:09,070
Rym: no not a token ring a token bus a token bus.

12
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:12,870
Scott: I've heard of such a thing, but I've never actually seen it or known how it worked.

13
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:29,696
Rym: You see what happened was I remember in all my history of computing classes at RIT We learned like Ethernet and all the different kinds of Ethernet and PC net and token ring And I remember our textbook had a little blurb like one paragraph And it said like token bus.

14
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:39,510
Rym: and all it said was token bus was similar to token ring in that it used token But was completely different in other ways and it is beyond the scope of this book.

15
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,060
Rym: All right, so we asked the professor.

16
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,529
Rym: He was like it's beyond the scope of this class.

17
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:46,875
Rym: It's it's alien.

18
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:50,949
Rym: It's utterly alien, and it's not used by anyone, but you had it.

19
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:54,290
Rym: Well, it was used mostly by factories.

20
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:58,730
Rym: I mean basically to get into a very very brief history of the Internet.

21
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,419
Rym: There are two ways to connect computers together.

22
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,282
Rym: on a fundamental level.

23
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:06,789
Rym: there are statistical networking methods And they're deterministic networking methods.

24
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:11,060
Rym: Token ring token bus all those things are deterministic.

25
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,967
Rym: you can calculate exactly how much latency.

26
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,230
Rym: They'll be between different machines.

27
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:19,380
Rym: Machines can't talk unless they get a little token or something.

28
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,708
Rym: so everything's very deterministic and collisions don't exist.

29
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:33,173
Rym: Ethernet was statistical meaning they expect a certain amount of collisions But statistically in the long run they expect most of the data to get through despite that Mm-hmm.

30
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:38,789
Rym: so it's very chaotic and they expected that via through the chaos the data would get through somehow all right.

31
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:48,450
Rym: and IBM backed Deterministic methods and other people like Xerox backed other methods and eventually ethernet won, and that's what we use today almost exclusively.

32
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:51,229
Scott: What are you gonna do with these token bus guards?

33
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,030
Rym: They're probably gonna be thrown away.

34
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,372
Rym: I'll see.

35
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:57,210
Rym: if they'll give me one to take home and put on display you just send them to the museum to put them next.

36
00:02:57,892 --> 00:02:59,438
Rym: I said they should donate them to RIT.

37
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:03,874
Rym: so next time a kid asks what the hell token bus is the professor can be Like it's this.

38
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:06,386
Scott: they'll just put them on the wall in the lab as decoration.

39
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:06,808
Scott: send a museum.

40
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,653
Scott: Museums are worried,

41
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:23,915
Rym: but actually token bus is kind of cool now that I know exactly what it was And I'm not gonna bore you with the details, but it is Basically a super super super deterministic real-time way of doing networking that was used in a lot of factories Back in the day.

42
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:25,444
Rym: GM was a big proponent of it.

43
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:30,210
Rym: all right It was used to control robots in factories, and now it use is used for nothing.

44
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:31,692
Scott: That's cool.

45
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:32,335
Scott: Yeah.

46
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:36,810
Rym: I was like old technology bits me too, so that's why it's fun working at IBM.

47
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,529
Rym: I find all this old busted crap like in back warehouses, and I get to fiddle with it.

48
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:44,243
Scott: You should go find it and destroy it and replace it with new stuff.

49
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:45,470
Rym: It's not even being used.

50
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,536
Rym: It's just like in boxes.

51
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,467
Scott: Wow just Wow.

52
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:54,820
Scott: yeah I wonder how much space and how much money it caused IBM to have all this old useless crap Taking up room

53
00:03:54,881 --> 00:04:03,328
Rym: and considering that They own more warehouse space than they need and that they owned large buildings with plenty of extra space and every now And then that stuff comes in handy.

54
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:07,049
Rym: Yeah, yeah, it's cool all right.

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:27,625
Scott: so speaking of computer hardware's The number one hard drive manufacturer in the world Seagate who I also happen to think is the best hard drive manufacturer in the world Has purchased for 1.9 billion dollars The third Largest hard drive manufacturer in the world which is max door the drive

56
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:28,870
Rym: the brand a I use

57
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:32,044
Scott: Which I would say makes the second best hard drives in the world.

58
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,350
Rym: Western Digital is number two.

59
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:38,449
Scott: Yeah, they make the second most number, but they I don't think they're good.

60
00:04:39,574 --> 00:04:40,790
Rym: Well actually it was funny.

61
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:47,956
Rym: I was looking on the slashed out article of and the comments about this and there were several people who said Western Digital is Fantastic and I've never had one die.

62
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,462
Rym: we use them in all our servers blah blah.

63
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:50,987
Scott: It's just statistics man.

64
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:58,329
Scott: Yeah, yeah It's not actually that those are worse, but I've had like two or three WDS die, and I've had Seagate.

65
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,288
Scott: I've never seen the Seagate crash except for this really old 20 megabyte one which doesn't count.

66
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:03,750
Rym: yeah.

67
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:15,009
Rym: So I guess you really can't listen to geeks when it comes to that kind of hard drive thing because basically hard drives crash all of them and Depending on what geek you talk to they'll have a different brand crash on them.

68
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:20,248
Scott: Yeah They will be loyal to another brand based solely on which brand crashed in which brand did not.

69
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:25,867
Rym: yeah Because the first hard drive ever had that crash was a Western Digital, and I haven't had a Western Digital since.

70
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:30,709
Rym: but My most recent hard drives crash was this max tour that I'm holding my hand right now.

71
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:32,840
Rym: It still has data on it, but I can't get the data.

72
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:34,870
Scott: I've seen his max store crash.

73
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:45,671
Scott: I've had WDS that crashed, and I've had Seagate's never crashed, so you yeah That's my really that that's the only reason I'm loyal to Seagate is Randomness.

74
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:47,699
Rym: basically well, and they give you the seashell.

75
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:50,510
Scott: oh the seashell is great cuz oh my god.

76
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:54,830
Rym: Oh, yeah, it's this little plastic thing that you can stick a hard drive in and it pretty much makes it invincible.

77
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,466
Scott: Yep, no no all the other hard drive manufacturers.

78
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:03,928
Scott: They don't give you crap They just give you the hard drive and maybe like a piece of plastic or a static bag or something.

79
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:10,049
Rym: yeah The seashell is very nice and patented by Seagate, but I wonder if they're gonna be any ramifications of this merger.

80
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:11,628
Rym: I mean Monopoly.

81
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:15,128
Scott: You know definitely Monopoly is one thing to worry about.

82
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:20,390
Scott: however I don't see them not keeping up hard drive technology.

83
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:23,050
Scott: They'll continue to improve hard drive technology.

84
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,195
Scott: So I'm not worried about that.

85
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:31,769
Scott: not like Microsoft's Monopoly where they stagnated software innovation Because you know oh we don't need to improve IE we have Monopoly.

86
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:38,790
Scott: The other worry is price increases because they can basically screw you because where else are you gonna go to get your hard drive?

87
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,549
Rym: Yeah, well you know what we'll go to Western Digital of that.

88
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:47,065
Scott: Yeah, if Seagate makes the price is way too high like oh for our new drives.

89
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:48,870
Scott: We will charge a bajillion dollars.

90
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,887
Scott: I'll just I'll really will buy a WD.

91
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:54,220
Rym: and Yeah, though the thing is with hard drives is one.

92
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,990
Rym: It's a real low margin market.

93
00:06:56,653 --> 00:07:00,250
Rym: They don't make so much profit per drive because it's a really competitive market.

94
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:04,229
Rym: And if you slip it all a Chinese manufacturer will appear and just destroy you.

95
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:05,856
Scott: See my worry here.

96
00:07:06,078 --> 00:07:24,070
Scott: the the place I can see it going wrong is let's say Seagate comes out with some new awesome hard drive technology because they have so many labs and things now right and the good research and They patent it and the only ones who have it and because they're so big they push it to be the standard

97
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:25,992
Rym: Luckily,

98
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:32,950
Scott: and then they screw us because aha the only place you can get the awesome hard drives with this technology is from us And we will charge more money.

99
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:40,370
Rym: A standard like that doesn't mean anything because I mean all different hard drives are pretty much completely different internally.

100
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:44,795
Rym: They use different mechanisms and different algorithms different chips And they're all pretty crazy.

101
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:51,762
Rym: and the only commonalities that on the end of them There is a little thing that is serial ATA or IDE or SCSI.

102
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:53,386
Scott: I'm not talking about the.

103
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:54,670
Scott: I'm not talking about the connector.

104
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,990
Rym: I don't think we'll have a worry about so if they don't the thing is currently the hard drive manufacturers do that.

105
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,350
Rym: Anyway, max tour has this special technology that they can make the drives quiet or fast.

106
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,364
Scott: Oh, yeah, but I'm talking about all of those are just mostly like marketing talk.

107
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:14,410
Scott: things like oh ours has feature XYZ which is just these little marketing labels that they say theirs is better.

108
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:18,909
Scott: I'm worried about them actually making something where their drives just wipe the floor with everyone else.

109
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:23,507
Rym: Yeah, there's not really much you could do without changing the interface as well.

110
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:24,270
Rym: That's just the drive.

111
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:28,767
Scott: Yeah, well Hitachi actually has that perpendicular thing going on.

112
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:33,389
Rym: Yeah Well, that's partly because Hitachi bought a IBM's hard drive division not so long ago.

113
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:38,130
Rym: Ah, well our drive market has been consolidating rapidly for the last five years.

114
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:40,001
Scott: So what happens when margins are low?

115
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:40,443
Scott: is you just?

116
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:41,490
Scott: you know, you buy up the other guy.

117
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:44,926
Scott: Yeah, but um, I heard that Hitachi.

118
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:45,589
Scott: There's a rumor.

119
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,338
Scott: I Even if it's not a rumor, I only saw one sentence.

120
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:58,908
Scott: So don't hold me to this rumor monger, but I saw it said Hitachi is working on or releasing a what was it like?

121
00:08:58,948 --> 00:08:59,310
Scott: a five?

122
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,057
Scott: Terabyte hard drive.

123
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:03,786
Rym: Oh, I saw that.

124
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:04,529
Rym: I don't know.

125
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:17,376
Scott: I think if now if they're using the perpendicular technology, I might believe it because basically right now the This is really really dumb and non-technological the way I'm gonna say this.

126
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:26,329
Scott: cuz actually I don't really understand it myself so much but The zeros and the ones in the hard drive are lying flat.

127
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,529
Scott: Perpendicular technology is where they're all stand up in a row.

128
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:34,282
Scott: Now if you think about zeros and ones lying flat on a disc.

129
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:38,969
Scott: as to them standing up on a disc You can fit a lot more if they're all standing up.

130
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:41,015
Scott: That's what perpendicular is.

131
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:44,987
Rym: to put it in a slightly more scientific light because that kind of hurt a little.

132
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:45,890
Scott: yeah, it hurt me too.

133
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:51,750
Rym: basically Data density is increasing and there have been a lot of reasons for that.

134
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,242
Rym: But basically older drives the bits are longer on the drive.

135
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:00,035
Rym: just because that's the resolution of bits like imagine a CD There's little pits on it.

136
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:04,479
Rym: It's the same basic deal on these magnetic bits instead Mm-hmm, and they're not.

137
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:09,010
Rym: they're not uniform in their shape They're rectangular and they've been making them smaller and smaller and smaller.

138
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:09,693
Rym: Like.

139
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:22,669
Rym: I remember it was a year or two ago when you might have heard about the magic pixie dust And it was a technology where they put a dust of magnetic Pseudo-material on hard drives internally and then you could get higher data density stuff like that.

140
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:33,547
Rym: so this perpendicular technology is really just a means of making the Bits on the drive smaller physically smaller, but still able to be read and verified.

141
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:41,990
Rym: Mm-hmm I don't know exactly how they do it because hard drive manufacturers are Incredibly secretive about their trip about their trade secrets and technology.

142
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,589
Scott: Just imagine a bunch of people lying on the ground right in it and they had it is 20 feet.

143
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:47,233
Scott: It's a 20.

144
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,485
Rym: think everyone gets it.

145
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:48,929
Scott: All right.

146
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:55,482
Scott: Well, if you need a further explanation There's actually an acute flash video Hitachi put out.

147
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:57,349
Scott: you can search for or will link to it.

148
00:10:57,611 --> 00:11:00,666
Scott: Yeah, just type in like perpendicular flash video or something into Google.

149
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,392
Scott: You should find it Yep.

150
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:07,999
Rym: Well the thing about hard drives is not only are the margins low But the prices are generally very constant.

151
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,050
Rym: the speed the size and speed just increase over time.

152
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:15,930
Rym: So like a lot of people think oh, I'll buy a cheapo 40 gigabyte hard drive for nothing.

153
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,810
Rym: But then you look and the 40 gigabyte hard drives aren't really any cheaper than the 180 gigabyte hard drives.

154
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:24,307
Scott: There's no real reason right now to buy a hard drive less than 80 gigs.

155
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:30,309
Scott: Yeah It's just a waste of money and really you can get 120 for maybe five ten bucks more sometimes.

156
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:34,678
Rym: But don't think they're ripping you off Basically, it's just that it cost the same.

157
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:41,546
Rym: once you figure out how to make a 400 gigabyte hard drive It cost almost the same to make one 400 gigabyte one as it does to make 140 gigabyte one.

158
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:48,010
Scott: Yeah, I mean a hard drive is a motor which cost the same no matter what as long as it's the same speed and power.

159
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,940
Rym: Yep, the platters that are very similarly manufactured.

160
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:51,241
Rym: Yep.

161
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:55,641
Scott: They're just platters and then there's a circuit board Which is mostly the same price no matter what.

162
00:11:56,224 --> 00:12:00,490
Scott: and the case it goes Do you put all the pieces together in which is the same price no matter what?

163
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,807
Scott: So the only difference is how many platters and what type of platter they are.

164
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:11,863
Scott: if they're high Higher-density platters cost more and having four platters instead of three or two cost more.

165
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,650
Scott: So that's really the only difference.

166
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:27,917
Scott: So an 80 gig drive might have like two 40 gig platters or three Like 20 something gig platters, you know, and if you compare that to a hundred gig drive Which might just have two or three platters.

167
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:29,662
Scott: It's not much price difference.

168
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,310
Scott: It's you know, so that's how it works.

169
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:40,578
Rym: Yeah, so we'll see what comes of this merger Mm-hmm, though in other extremely esoteric computer geek news X11 r7.

170
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:47,306
Rym: So are you right now that if you're not very technical, we're sorry about this next short segment.

171
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:48,169
Scott: Just fast forward.

172
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:58,630
Scott: Yeah So in Linux when you or Unix when you want a GUI use the X window system And if you use Unix Linux, you know this it's pretty universal.

173
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:15,296
Scott: Yeah and until very recently you were using X free 86 now and We just switched to X org because X free 86 changed their license and now X org is better and actually improving X. and before X org X3 wasn't really improving X at all.

174
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:23,103
Scott: They were just pretty much making X and incrementally bug fixing and Doing small performance enhancements.

175
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:29,039
Scott: They weren't adding features they're actually trying to go anywhere but people kept using it because that's what it was and no one was competing with them.

176
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,022
Scott: and It pretty much stayed that way for 10 years.

177
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:41,451
Scott: For almost 10 years X free 86 was just had X 11 r6 and it was just stagnant unchanging.

178
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:44,450
Scott: that's why gooeys and Linux still really suck.

179
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:48,863
Rym: Yep, because it's really hard to do things with X in certain cases.

180
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:53,294
Rym: It's very obtuse and Yeah, it is.

181
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:54,959
Rym: But now that's not even like.

182
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:05,138
Scott: that's like people who know a lot about it say that - yeah It also had a lot of inherent problems with its design and then they used a lot of hacks over the years to cover them up.

183
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:14,995
Scott: Like it was just inherently insecure because but it would be wanted to have this feature where it was network transparent and That's sort of conflicted.

184
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,950
Scott: So they just kind of hacked at it until they made it fake secure.

185
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,788
Scott: anyway Since X org took over they've actually been working on it.

186
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:37,167
Scott: So now finally today they released the final official version of X 11 r7 Which is gonna screw a lot of people up because they have that USR X 11 r6 folder.

187
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,810
Scott: Yeah, and Right the way it works is it's modular.

188
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:59,329
Scott: so now the parts that you want you have and the parts that you don't want you don't have and Everything that used to suck before now works in either an awesome way or at least a nicer way especially things like mouses.

189
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:01,890
Rym: Yeah, I mean there are issues.

190
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:10,910
Rym: I use some crap old red hat boxes at work and I had to reconfigure X because certain mice That I mean standard ps2 mice just fucked up.

191
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:17,109
Rym: They would they would crash X and I had to die to do some hackish things to make them not crash X.

192
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:19,679
Scott: I mean it used to have to be there used to be.

193
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,450
Scott: I remember when I first was using Linux four or five years ago.

194
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:25,369
Scott: He couldn't make a USB Mouse work just by putting it in.

195
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:33,545
Scott: I mean and even today if you don't configure it, right, you know things don't you might the mouse might not work Or you might unplug the mouse plug it back in and it won't work.

196
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,412
Scott: It's crazy now.

197
00:15:35,492 --> 00:15:46,030
Rym: I just saw this while I while we were talking I was looking through the article on this and Some guy named sim hacker on slashdot has probably the most succinct description of X that I've ever seen.

198
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:55,409
Rym: alright X windows is the Iran contra of graphical user interfaces a tragedy of political compromises entangled alliances marketing hype and greed.

199
00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:59,024
Rym: X windows is to memory as Ronald Reagan is to money.

200
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:02,040
Rym: Yeah It goes on and on like that.

201
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,147
Rym: So props to this guy.

202
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:03,670
Rym: That's yeah.

203
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:14,310
Scott: Basically anyone who's using some leet awesome distribution like gen 2 or something will have x11r7 Within days probably.

204
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:18,685
Rym: Yeah, and if you've got red hat you're never gonna get it don't even.

205
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:22,038
Scott: yeah, if you're using fedora You're gonna be waiting a few months to get it.

206
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:31,450
Rym: Honestly, if you're using fedora, you're probably better off not Upgrading you're very better off using Ubuntu or if you're gonna use this you're gonna have to pretty much wipe out your system.

207
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:38,659
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there'll be a how-to in a few days and some rpms like here's how to do it Here's how to do it, but it won't work for everyone.

208
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,778
Scott: It won't work in all cases and you know, but Pretty much what it comes down to is.

209
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:55,930
Scott: I'm willing to bet the gen 2 will have it working first but they'll have a few problems with the people who go for it real early and Ubuntu will be the engine and Debian will be the first people to have it working reliably and awesomely.

210
00:16:57,871 --> 00:17:05,500
Scott: And I'm really looking forward to it because it's gonna make I think it's going to make a jump in the usability of Linux as big as the 2.6 kernel made.

211
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:14,270
Rym: if It actually does all that's promised and it works and people are able to extend and modify and enhance this could be really awesome.

212
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:19,207
Rym: Yeah, like this could be one of the factors that we really need to get Linux out there on the desktop.

213
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:24,990
Scott: to non geeks I remember when the 2.4 kernel was when I started using Linux and it was kind of paint.

214
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,974
Scott: Well, I technically used older kernels than that, but 2.4 was the first kernel I really interacted with.

215
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:34,249
Rym: 2.4 was the first kernel where I knew what a kernel was and what I did.

216
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:38,010
Scott: and You know, it wasn't great for desktop thing.

217
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,274
Scott: It was just kind of like a mess.

218
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:41,079
Scott: and then 2.6 made everything.

219
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,610
Scott: it was just just leaps and bounds ahead in terms of greatness.

220
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:53,549
Scott: I completely forget a lot of 2.4 because I use 2.6 so much now and it's so great and I'm hoping x11 r7 does the same thing and it probably will.

221
00:18:02,856 --> 00:18:06,237
Rym: Alright, so my thing of the day Gamers have bad posture.

222
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,550
Rym: I do and gamers and I'm no exception.

223
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,466
Rym: I remember when I was a young kid playing like Final Fantasy, you know one.

224
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:20,410
Rym: You'd pretty much sit there hunched over with the controller Just kind of in the state of bed for hours and hours hours on end.

225
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:20,992
Rym: I did.

226
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:25,450
Rym: didn't you ever want to prop your chin up on something or kind of like prop your body up on something?

227
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,669
Scott: No, what I wanted to do is lay down on my back.

228
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:35,550
Scott: That's what I and with like my head resting on a pillow But I could never get a video game close enough to my bed until like Game Boys and DS is no sorts of things.

229
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:38,106
Rym: Well, luckily science has made advances in this field.

230
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:42,521
Rym: Hooray I mean we have the video rockers which we have and are awesome awesome.

231
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:45,370
Rym: And now there's the head pillow.

232
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:48,017
Rym: It's it's sold in Japan.

233
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:49,404
Rym: I don't know if it's coming to the US or not.

234
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,289
Rym: I imagine it will.

235
00:18:51,410 --> 00:19:01,685
Rym: Basically, it looks like a video rocker But just the back end and it sits on your lap and it's positioned in such a way that it holds your chin and head up But yeah, your arms can still get around it.

236
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:05,336
Rym: You'll have to look at the picture in the link.

237
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:12,469
Scott: It's both cool and sad at the same time Yeah, but that's pretty much the exact thing you get by looking at it.

238
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:24,530
Scott: So I'm sure everyone knows about be money games which are you know in the beat mania series from Konami and other similar rhythm games?

239
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,923
Scott: dance-dance revolution, you know or you know the game.

240
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:38,070
Scott: play the guitar and push the buttons to the beat or dance to the beat or Wave your hands to the beat and we are going to do a show on DDR at some point.

241
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,519
Rym: It's been requested by two people.

242
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,405
Rym: So hang in there.

243
00:19:40,425 --> 00:19:49,110
Scott: All right, and There is one current existing game called taiko drum master, which is a beat game where you bang on a taiko drum.

244
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:56,430
Scott: Yeah, I always wanted to play because it looks really cool Yeah, but anyway, I never played it, but I do know of it and I've seen it has these cute little drum guys.

245
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:02,409
Scott: we're all happy and everything and I'm sure that everyone in Japan is just the lead master of this game.

246
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:09,290
Scott: But it's the first time on the internet that I've seen video of someone playing the hardest songs in the game.

247
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,762
Rym: Perfectly, you know what?

248
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:17,630
Scott: Wow Yeah, I mean, I've seen lots of DDR videos and they're usually impressive because someone dances in an interesting way or something.

249
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:20,925
Scott: This is just a guy playing the game boringly now.

250
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:27,430
Scott: I Expected to be impressed by some crazy as drumming But I watched the first song and it was pretty lame.

251
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,620
Scott: Like I'm like I could do that with a little bit of practice.

252
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,966
Scott: It's not hard at all.

253
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:33,894
Rym: Yeah, I mean I Back in high school.

254
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:37,547
Rym: I was a trumpet player, but I like did some set drumming on the side.

255
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:38,410
Rym: Like I wasn't very good.

256
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:48,889
Rym: I'm not even gonna pretend that I was a good drummer, but I played a set drum for some pet band and Pretty much the hardest song in the game as far as I can tell is like basic basic basic snare drumming.

257
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:54,250
Scott: Yep, but the the second song was significantly more impressive in his difficulty.

258
00:20:55,492 --> 00:21:05,409
Scott: Well, you know, it would actually take me a little while before I would be able to do it as well as that guy did But at the same time it's still not nearly as crazy as some of the DDR things are.

259
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:09,765
Rym: yeah I mean even some of the moderately difficult DDR songs are insane compared to this.

260
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:20,364
Scott: Yeah, absolutely but it's still cool to watch and especially the second song if you've never seen taiko drum master or If you want to know what it looks like when someone scores perfectly on the hardest song.

261
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:22,680
Scott: Yeah, I thought it was cool It was alright.

262
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:26,501
Rym: Yep So today being anime day and comic day.

263
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:34,095
Rym: We've been watching big o - We just saw the first episode of Space Symphony.

264
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:38,732
Rym: my tell which is part of that whole my tell Harlock Saga.

265
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:39,455
Rym: that's complicated.

266
00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:40,739
Scott: Yeah, I like to express really.

267
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,866
Rym: Yeah, and then we got some comics.

268
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:43,509
Scott: Mm-hmm.

269
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:48,826
Rym: So, uh big o I talked about back in the scotless show quite some time ago.

270
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:56,649
Rym: It's a good show and I'm not gonna spoil anything but suffice to say the end of big O is unsatisfying.

271
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:00,529
Scott: that's Putting it lightly by unsatisfying.

272
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:12,495
Rym: imagine if suddenly in about 25 seconds worth of episode they introduce a whole shit ton of plot and then a crazy thing happens and then the episode just stops And that's the end of the whole show.

273
00:22:12,937 --> 00:22:13,821
Scott: Yeah, that was the end of.

274
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:15,950
Scott: that was the 13th episode of big o one.

275
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:23,082
Rym: So you'll be pleased to know that big o two starts up right there Like exactly where the first show ended.

276
00:22:23,404 --> 00:22:28,462
Scott: I mean as far as I'm concerned It's really a 26 episode show and just call the second 13.

277
00:22:28,462 --> 00:22:29,967
Scott: I think we go to 13 episodes.

278
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:41,065
Scott: I think so They just call the second 13 episodes big o - because the show Originally ended after the 13th and then cards you Network had to pay them to make more.

279
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:46,769
Rym: Yep The though the one thing that I got to say big o - definitely has plot this time.

280
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:53,895
Scott: Yeah, big o one some of the episodes were sort of episodic and that they didn't matter to the plot and a lot of things Are real vague.

281
00:22:54,519 --> 00:23:04,444
Scott: and big o - certainly isn't Straightforward by any means but is much much much more straightforward Yeah, but it's like, you know what an anime and they always have like.

282
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:06,530
Scott: it's the whole effect of the guy in white.

283
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:10,170
Scott: Remember the Simpsons episode was the guy in white and he hasn't done anything.

284
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,110
Rym: This is the episode where the Mafia and the Chinese triad are fighting with each other or the rockers.

285
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:14,612
Rym: I forget.

286
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:22,470
Scott: it was something like that on the front lawn of Simpsons house and Homer's like Oh, I know when he he hasn't done anything and he looks different than the other guys.

287
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,973
Scott: so I know when he does something it's gonna be Awesome.

288
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:31,906
Scott: and margins like get in the house Homer and then as soon as he closed the door you hear like wow And he's like, oh I missed it.

289
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:45,166
Scott: Well when you watch an anime, there's usually like some big bad guys who are all secretive or mysteries that aren't revealed Right, and then towards the end they start to do more and more things that make you go.

290
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:46,913
Scott: Oh my god There's the thing.

291
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:47,819
Scott: Oh my god.

292
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,509
Scott: It was a secret that is now revealed, right?

293
00:23:50,371 --> 00:23:52,219
Scott: Well big o2 is pretty much just.

294
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,710
Scott: they really step it up in terms of that kind of stuff.

295
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,914
Scott: It's like there's a guy.

296
00:23:56,436 --> 00:24:00,269
Scott: the main secretive guy is talking a lot and he's a major part of the plot.

297
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:06,453
Scott: Oh, we actually get to see all kinds of stuff that used to just be in the background and sort of implied Mysterious.

298
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:14,190
Rym: Yep, you know like in the first one like you really weren't sure what was going on like Rosewater who was kind of this like the head of paradigm city.

299
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:18,489
Rym: You only saw him talk like four times and he'd say some offhand thing, but everything he said was like, huh?

300
00:24:18,753 --> 00:24:23,403
Rym: Ah Yep, now he's just like a main character.

301
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:24,490
Rym: He's talking all the time.

302
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:30,530
Rym: He explains in great detail like very obscure obscure plot points that you've been wondering about forever.

303
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,800
Rym: The problem is for everything they reveal.

304
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:36,030
Rym: they introduced two or three more mysteries.

305
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:39,650
Scott: Yeah, like there's this new bad guy who's all evil and you know, he's a bad guy.

306
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:45,950
Scott: He's got a kind of a kefka attitude But they don't tell you jack about him other than you know, he's bad and you know, you got to get rid of him.

307
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:51,149
Rym: He seems to be working for our Rosewater there But I don't know if it's gonna be a kefka where there's betrayal or what.

308
00:24:51,613 --> 00:25:00,270
Scott: The other thing they do is there's a lot of recurring going on Like there were episodes that you thought were just kind of Blair before like the ones a little seat the diving guys.

309
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:10,839
Scott: But now the diving guys reappear and it's like recurring things meaning recurring and explained like oh Okay, that's what they were doing.

310
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:22,650
Rym: Yep, like remember that episode again Really voting spoilers here, but when there's the girl and she has the red balloon Let's go of it and it flies away and they keep like focused on this red balloon, but they don't explain it.

311
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:33,174
Rym: You think it's just like a metaphor a symbol of something that comes back twice in the first four episodes of big o2 And he's like the second time you're like, oh That makes perfect sense.

312
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:33,535
Scott: Now.

313
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:39,410
Scott: Yeah now I know the red balloon is it's actually means something physical not just kind of a symbol.

314
00:25:39,691 --> 00:25:42,222
Rym: Yeah, it's very much a literal physical event.

315
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:43,447
Rym: It is not just metaphor.

316
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:47,930
Scott: Yep It's pretty cool when stuff like that happens and you only catch it if you're paying attention.

317
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:51,130
Scott: If you watch the show lazily, you'll miss a lot of stuff.

318
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:53,076
Rym: Yeah, like big o1 you can get away with that.

319
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:53,257
Rym: cuz.

320
00:25:53,297 --> 00:25:53,578
Rym: alright.

321
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,621
Rym: now the robots are fighting.

322
00:25:54,842 --> 00:25:55,183
Rym: Whoo.

323
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:56,969
Rym: Oh, we punched him real hard.

324
00:25:57,531 --> 00:25:58,156
Rym: They go to.

325
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:09,030
Rym: everything means something Or at least mean something in the sense that if you've ever seen the later episodes of utenna It gets to the point where things mean something but you're not sure and it might just like be.

326
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:10,815
Rym: It's hard to explain.

327
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:14,410
Rym: some things are silly like there's this tomato thing going on.

328
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:16,816
Scott: Tomato thing makes sense in big O.

329
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:19,446
Rym: it makes sense in big O but is definitely a metaphor.

330
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:20,590
Scott: It's definitely a metaphor.

331
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,367
Rym: It's an obvious metaphor where things turn into tomatoes and everyone's always eating tomatoes and there's tomatoes everywhere.

332
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:31,311
Rym: Yep And if you think I'm exaggerating no Roger Smith wakes up in a pile of tomatoes at one point Yep.

333
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:36,430
Scott: Anyway, the other cool thing about big o2 is the robot reveals a lot more of its powers.

334
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:41,104
Scott: Yeah, big o1 pretty much all it does is punch and it has.

335
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,360
Scott: I think he used the eye laser a couple times Once they use the missile in this.

336
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:49,490
Scott: once it used the missiles But just once and then I think he might have used the metal hooks once.

337
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:58,907
Scott: Yeah in big o2 he uses like a bunch of metal hooks and a bunch of guns And all kinds of crazy weaponry on the robot that he never used before.

338
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:03,244
Rym: cuz in big o1 You notice how whenever he fought someone it was someone where just there was no chance.

339
00:27:03,284 --> 00:27:03,967
Rym: He was just gonna win.

340
00:27:04,027 --> 00:27:09,808
Rym: no matter what Big o2 he's fighting things that are as dangerous if not more dangerous than the big.

341
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:14,650
Rym: Oh, yep The big O takes damage loses arms gets parts of it blown off.

342
00:27:15,356 --> 00:27:15,862
Scott: It's pretty cool.

343
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:30,169
Rym: Yeah now the one thing I wonder is we've seen the first DVD a big o2 and Almost everything from big o1 no matter how minor it was is now Coming back into big o2 and being explained and is usually really important.

344
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,562
Rym: What I'm wondering is it was that intended from the beginning?

345
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:38,540
Rym: or did they go through those episodes and decide alright Let's take this and make it mean this.

346
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,669
Rym: Let's take this and do this with it.

347
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,259
Scott: Well, if it's the second one did a really good job.

348
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:48,804
Scott: Yeah, there's one way to find out and I think reading the mom I well, I think reading the manga might reveal the truth,

349
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:57,267
Rym: of course I'm also wondering if they just made up a bunch of stuff and then when they ran out of stuff to make up they tried To do something that they had.

350
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:12,560
Rym: Because we watched one of the or we read one of the interviews with the guy who made big O and Basically he got the idea big O spawned in his head when he decided he wanted a guy like Batman To pilot a big robot in a city like Gotham.

351
00:28:13,062 --> 00:28:13,303
Rym: Mm-hmm.

352
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:14,145
Rym: That is all.

353
00:28:14,186 --> 00:28:18,730
Scott: big O started as Yep, actually it also has a little bit of Megaman.

354
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:31,230
Scott: I think one of the artists is Megaman artist and also I watched like the first couple episodes of steam detectives and Steam detectives and big O. I mean you can't say that big O didn't steal anything just out of hand.

355
00:28:32,952 --> 00:28:42,854
Scott: Just look at the coat that the main character of steam detectives wears and the buttons on it and compared to Roger Smith's coat and The fact that there's big robots that yeah, you're just done right there.

356
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:43,575
Scott: That's it.

357
00:28:45,979 --> 00:28:46,059
Rym: Now.

358
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,040
Rym: There's one episode.

359
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:48,566
Rym: This was the first episode.

360
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:50,091
Rym: I think I don't remember.

361
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:51,336
Rym: there's a weird episode.

362
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:52,200
Scott: That was the first one.

363
00:28:52,461 --> 00:29:00,113
Rym: Yeah, like it picks up with the action, but there's this weird episode And to bring up just utenna yet is very utenna esque there.

364
00:29:00,193 --> 00:29:11,011
Rym: It was a very like super metaphoric Yes, and Aviva very much and all I have to say about that is that when you see it and you're wondering what the fuck we Also thought what the fuck.

365
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:11,476
Rym: so don't worry.

366
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:23,079
Scott: Hopefully by the end of big O in a whole as a whole that that will be sealed up and you will Understand at least what half of that means, but I don't know because I haven't seen that far.

367
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:31,796
Rym: Yeah, honestly if big O - doesn't explain enough like there's a threshold of an amount of things I want explained I'm going nuts and killing Scott great.

368
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,177
Rym: So, uh Mitel Mitel legend Harlock and all that.

369
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:41,766
Rym: Yep We got the first episode.

370
00:29:41,786 --> 00:29:45,300
Rym: Like I said of a space symphony Mitel and we watched it and it's really cool.

371
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:50,779
Scott: Yep, it reminds me a lot of well all the other Galaxy Express shows.

372
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:55,911
Rym: I mean, it's a really hard series to sink your teeth into.

373
00:29:56,252 --> 00:30:02,450
Rym: it's real complicated the timelines convoluted It's hard to tell where it starts and ends or what's going on.

374
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,794
Rym: A lot of the characters look similar.

375
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:05,419
Rym: It's really super stylized.

376
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:09,579
Scott: Well, it's in the same style that all of that guy's stuff is in.

377
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,486
Scott: I forget Why can't I remember his name though?

378
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:23,029
Scott: Ah, but he's the same guy who did all the Galaxy Express is all the Harlocks interstellar 555 Battleship Yamato All those things and all his stuff.

379
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:24,576
Scott: is people are drawn the same way.

380
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:25,218
Scott: They're kind of like.

381
00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:27,818
Scott: They're like kind of wavy I guess.

382
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:29,405
Rym: Yeah, real like.

383
00:30:29,465 --> 00:30:34,140
Rym: take the the be shown in like the old school be shown in very tall very thin and take it to an extreme.

384
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:35,344
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

385
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:37,550
Scott: it's like this unique anime style.

386
00:30:37,591 --> 00:30:38,032
Scott: That's like.

387
00:30:38,092 --> 00:30:40,560
Scott: it's definitely anime, but it's like.

388
00:30:41,822 --> 00:30:52,224
Scott: It's as if the old anime style of like Tezuka was taken in a different direction as opposed to the direction that all the other anime went in which is a direction that lotos war took them in.

389
00:30:52,845 --> 00:31:02,636
Rym: I mean character designs are very unrealistic and very stylized but there's there's a lot of depth of emotion and Cool things you can do with these characters.

390
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:09,120
Scott: as a result Mm-hmm, and the plots are very space epic, which is very lacking around in general.

391
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:15,479
Scott: So if you like space epic You got to watch all these things and figure out what order to put them in and yeah, it's great.

392
00:31:15,963 --> 00:31:22,326
Rym: So space symphony might tell is Basically as far as we can tell the second thing in the chronological timeline.

393
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,610
Scott: in the chronological timeline of Galaxy Express.

394
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:31,717
Scott: See this Galaxy Express and Harlock seems to be separate but sometimes Harlock appears in the Galaxy Express.

395
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:32,680
Scott: It's the same universe.

396
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:33,382
Scott: It's like.

397
00:31:33,422 --> 00:31:38,979
Scott: sometimes his plot kind of intertwines with the Galaxy Express plot, but it's not the same thing.

398
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:47,739
Scott: Captain Harlock is a story of a space pirate and Galaxy Express is the story of the cyborg people You see and sometimes Harlock interferes.

399
00:31:48,302 --> 00:31:51,699
Rym: Yeah, if we did our research we could try to a whole show just trying to explain this.

400
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:57,777
Scott: Yeah But the Galaxy Express order as I can tell from information on the internet is my tell.

401
00:31:57,817 --> 00:31:58,740
Scott: legend is the first.

402
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:00,878
Scott: This is the second thing.

403
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:09,977
Scott: There is something else that is not yet made because the Japanese but the Japanese website says coming soon September 2005 so don't ask me about that.

404
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:19,380
Scott: and And Then comes the Galaxy Express movies one, two, three four, but the Galaxy Express TV show comes before the Galaxy Express first movie.

405
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:26,128
Rym: So as for this specific one space symphony might tell it's kind of modern in terms of.

406
00:32:26,148 --> 00:32:27,610
Rym: there's definitely some CG going on.

407
00:32:28,484 --> 00:32:34,137
Rym: it's kind of recently made and My first impression is that it's very good and I want to see more of it.

408
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:40,220
Scott: Yeah, got the original Galaxy Express movie was like one of the first animes I ever saw.

409
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,060
Scott: Yeah, cuz it was on that sci-fi channel thing was on the sci-fi channel thing and I was just like whoa.

410
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:47,410
Rym: It was on right after earth.

411
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,100
Rym: say it sir - if I recall correctly

412
00:32:50,702 --> 00:33:05,476
Scott: Mmm, and I think the day after I watched the second movie which wasn't as good as the first movie, but still awesome And it always seems to have this message of you know cyborg people, you know It's it's better to be a normal human because cyborg people are like immortal.

413
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:10,380
Scott: and thus, you know What's the point of living if you're gonna live forever blah blah blah blah blah, you know?

414
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,300
Scott: And then you always have pity on the normal people who are like revolting against the robot.

415
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:18,500
Rym: So then you have pity on the robot people who are like tragic and immortal.

416
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:21,851
Scott: Yeah, because the robot people actually are still people.

417
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:35,726
Scott: so it's like when they die, you're still also kind of like you know, but this one seems to be a little less in that direction and More in the everyone is people direction, you know because I remember the Galaxy Express.

418
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:36,730
Scott: you just like outright.

419
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:37,934
Scott: the cyborgs are bad.

420
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:51,160
Scott: the humans are good and like the kids mom like it starts out with his kids mom being like hunted by a robot guy as If she was like a deer and then he like hangs her on his wall and stuff and it's like oh robots are bad.

421
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:58,750
Scott: This one is much less that which I think is good because it kind of shows you that the whole universe isn't that way.

422
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:03,662
Scott: It gives you a new perspective on the what's going on Now.

423
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:07,835
Rym: don't be turned off by the fact that there's a steam-powered locomotive in space.

424
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:09,460
Scott: Oh, of course not.

425
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,183
Rym: That's just kind of.

426
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:11,830
Rym: that's like a symbol of this show.

427
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:16,476
Rym: There's there's this galactic train and Just go with it.

428
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,110
Rym: Suspension of disbelief.

429
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,400
Rym: the show is cool and worth it.

430
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,304
Rym: Don't look at that.

431
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:23,719
Rym: like some people looked at eska flones long noses and say I can't watch this.

432
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:28,960
Scott: Yeah They actually explain the Train in many places and such and the Train is actually really cool.

433
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,293
Scott: And if you watch Galaxy Express, you'll learn all about the Train.

434
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:33,920
Rym: and yeah, Galaxy Express 999.

435
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,168
Rym: I love the credible movie.

436
00:34:35,188 --> 00:34:35,953
Rym: if you haven't seen it.

437
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:37,000
Rym: I recommend it highly.

438
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:42,540
Scott: Yeah, so it's like for people who've already seen or know about this universe read the manga saw their shows.

439
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,911
Scott: The Train is like this symbol of like awesomeness.

440
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:50,290
Scott: So just having a show with the Train in it is like oh There's the Train.

441
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:54,279
Scott: Oh my god You know and they already know all this other stuff about it.

442
00:34:54,487 --> 00:35:01,668
Scott: You know Like if you watch this show and you've never seen any of it before you'll see like the conductor and he just comes on He conducts he seems perfectly normal.

443
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:04,080
Scott: But if you know the conductor, it's like whoa.

444
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:15,877
Rym: So, I guess I mean this is kind of obscure anime that most people it's very definitely not mainstream definitely not mainstream I mean, it's not up there with the Naruto's mainstream in Japan.

445
00:35:16,098 --> 00:35:21,194
Rym: Yes But especially for people out there who might not know a lot about anime.

446
00:35:21,515 --> 00:35:22,920
Rym: I can't recommend this stuff enough.

447
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,790
Rym: It's very neat very cerebral.

448
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:38,107
Scott: It's it's good stuff Mm-hmm, and as long as you I mean the order in which the series go in might be complex But as long as you watch all the series is themselves in their order It doesn't really matter which ones you watch.

449
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:47,080
Scott: when I mean there are prequels that came out after sequels and OAVs and movies and Just watch as much as you can and it'll all fit together and it'll be enjoyable.

450
00:35:47,382 --> 00:35:51,645
Rym: And if you need a good starting point, I'd once again Galaxy Express 999.

451
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:52,228
Rym: Yep.

452
00:35:52,248 --> 00:35:54,219
Scott: The first movie is definitely a great starting point.

453
00:35:55,841 --> 00:36:00,040
Scott: All right, so you picked up some comics - I went to the comic book store today.

454
00:36:00,562 --> 00:36:02,451
Scott: Let's look in this little bag here to see what I bought.

455
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:08,627
Scott: Ooh Midtown Comics Oh That's the one I'm gonna save for last.

456
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:09,411
Rym: so okay.

457
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:10,074
Rym: It better be good.

458
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:11,943
Scott: I Think it's good.

459
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:12,565
Scott: That's the that's.

460
00:36:12,686 --> 00:36:13,811
Scott: there's a story behind it.

461
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:14,594
Rym: Well, he's digging out.

462
00:36:14,654 --> 00:36:18,834
Rym: since media play is going out of business I picked up all the rest of here's Greenwood at a steep discount.

463
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:20,100
Rym: Mm-hmm, cuz I like that mom.

464
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,623
Scott: they also have a great cheap toys going down at Media play.

465
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:34,502
Scott: Yeah, so if you like toys, that's a great place to go Alright, so the first thing I bought was this gravity digest which the comic book podcast guys are really hyping it up Now.

466
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:37,560
Scott: I had seen this in the comic book store before.

467
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:43,502
Scott: They hyped it up and I was waiting for them to put it all in one book because I wasn't gonna buy five comic books Of some.

468
00:36:43,803 --> 00:36:46,793
Scott: it just looks like some normal superhero guy kind of generic.

469
00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:48,920
Rym: I see a superhero flying with an arm outstretched.

470
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:58,100
Scott: Yep now and that will make you kind of feel kind of a if you're like us and you don't like superheroes So much or at least generic superhero stories.

471
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,968
Scott: however this actually Surprised the hell out of me really.

472
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:07,020
Scott: I read it just because they told me to and it was only eight bucks.

473
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:11,660
Scott: So for a whole book of comics, that's a great deal because normally one comic book is three bucks.

474
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,651
Scott: This is like five or six comic books.

475
00:37:14,053 --> 00:37:30,166
Scott: So hell yeah, and You know First off it's a story about this kid Who has superpowers of gravity and he can fly and he can hit strong and do anything, you know, it's very generic superpowers But he's got.

476
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,820
Scott: he's pretty strong you can kick the shit out of things and beat people up and all kinds of good stuff.

477
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:39,660
Scott: all right, and You know his his origin is a simple generic origin.

478
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:44,020
Scott: Oh, he was on a boat and he got sucked into a vortex and it gave him gravity powers.

479
00:37:44,541 --> 00:38:09,339
Scott: whatever the story starts where he goes to college at NYU leaving the hickville of Wisconsin and It's more a story about him in NYU and in New York City Managing his life as you know in the aspects of grades girlfriend Friends in general and superheroing at night not getting enough sleep.

480
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:19,455
Scott: So if you like stories or if you're about to go to college or if you're in college or nostalgic for college This will hit you in so many ways.

481
00:38:19,475 --> 00:38:21,685
Scott: I Mean literally.

482
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:32,719
Scott: you see this guy like going out to parties and stuff and then You know the girlfriend's trying to go with guys despite him and it's good stuff and It's also good.

483
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:39,320
Scott: The second aspect of it is from the superhero part is he's a total noob at super heroing like it's New York.

484
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:48,238
Scott: so there's real superheroes all over the place in the Marvel Universe and You see him like try to help out real superheroes and like go away new buying babysitting you, huh?

485
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:57,160
Scott: And like he gets tricked like someone comes in is like help help I can't open my car and since he's just a noob, that's the kind of thing he handles, right?

486
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,896
Scott: So he goes and he opens the car and then the guy just steals it.

487
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:03,308
Scott: He's like, hey He's like crap.

488
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:04,194
Scott: I'm a noob.

489
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:11,759
Scott: I got fooled You know and it's about him becoming from a noob to a not noob superhero, you know, which is pretty cool.

490
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:19,671
Scott: the other fun the thing I like about this is the Sort of things that go on in the background that are hilarious.

491
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:24,960
Scott: Like if you look here right in the beginning There's a guy who's a hot dog vendor.

492
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,860
Scott: But obviously there's something special about that hot dog vendor.

493
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:33,880
Scott: It's a me a Mario and he's peeing in front of a sign for the producers.

494
00:39:36,142 --> 00:39:37,245
Scott: You know, it's that kind of stuff.

495
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:42,360
Scott: and like the roommate is always playing as Nintendo DS and that's kind of hilarious, too.

496
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,287
Scott: You know, it's it's it's stuff like that.

497
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:56,178
Scott: That makes it pretty cool when you and also I think Let me just check on this Yeah, yep is there the one of the guys who worked on this comic is like buddy.

498
00:39:56,218 --> 00:39:59,559
Scott: buddy with the Guys from the comic geek speak podcast.

499
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:07,720
Scott: So you see like towards the end the guy the kid is searching for male freshman from Wisconsin at NYU on his computer.

500
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:15,700
Scott: And you see one of the people on the list is one of the guys from the comic book podcast Because he's from Wisconsin.

501
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:17,560
Scott: It's pretty cool.

502
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:23,878
Scott: if you like college or New York because it has they like mention all these NYU buildings and stuff and they get blown up.

503
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:29,340
Scott: and So if you're at NYU, this is just great for you to read because you'll be laughing it up.

504
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:32,523
Scott: No next All right.

505
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:35,073
Scott: The second thing I bought was preacher volume 4.

506
00:40:35,073 --> 00:40:36,358
Scott: I think I already talked about preacher.

507
00:40:36,598 --> 00:40:37,000
Rym: Yeah, you did.

508
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,226
Rym: I still have to start reading that.

509
00:40:38,346 --> 00:40:38,889
Scott: Yeah, I was.

510
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:45,360
Scott: I was a little confused because this one had different artists But actually this they should have told me this but I would have bought it.

511
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,499
Scott: Anyway, it's not in the continuity of the story.

512
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:53,720
Scott: It was a side story about one of the not main characters, but I'm still good.

513
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,640
Scott: I've yet to read it, but it's probably really cool.

514
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:05,318
Scott: But just so you know that you if you don't want to read preacher volume 4 you can skip volume 4 Although I wouldn't recommend it because I think it's pretty cool and it has different artists.

515
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:11,516
Scott: Third thing I brought was testament number one, which is by my buddy rush cough.

516
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:18,111
Scott: now When I say this knowing you Rym, I think you're really gonna like it.

517
00:41:18,993 --> 00:41:21,900
Scott: Oh really and not in a penny arcade way in a real.

518
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:25,219
Scott: Basically it starts off.

519
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:50,758
Scott: It's supposed to be a modern open source Bible telling right and it starts off With a comic book telling of the story of Abraham bringing his son Isaac up the mountain and all that stuff, right and then immediately They kind of put that on top of a story about a kid a dad sending his son to the draft You know like Oh sacrificing the Sun sacrificing the Sun

520
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:56,954
Rym: Like you go Whenever something's like metaphorical or meaningful.

521
00:41:57,075 --> 00:41:57,900
Scott: Yeah, it's really cool.

522
00:41:58,481 --> 00:42:04,920
Scott: And then there's a point where like Doug is you there's a professor teaching a class and you can tell they it's Doug rush cough.

523
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:13,034
Scott: they drew him that's his face into the comic as a teacher and It's a story about how like it's sort of like, you know how.

524
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:14,460
Scott: now we're all worried about Big Brother.

525
00:42:15,006 --> 00:42:16,160
Scott: Well, this is super Big Brother.

526
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:22,683
Scott: You have these rebel kids who are dodging the draft by cutting the RF IDs out of their arms and hiding in a swimming pool In a building.

527
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:23,787
Scott: Wow.

528
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:28,211
Scott: Yeah, it gets pretty crazy, but everything is Contrasted with.

529
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:44,760
Scott: you know The the Bible but the reason that you're gonna like it is because it's not the Old Testament as written it's the Old Testament as like, you know, the Somewhat real telling of you know, there were many and then one God came and killed all the other.

530
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:50,745
Scott: You know the real somewhat Archaeological historical type.

531
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:54,840
Rym: I'm real big on that like pre Christian pre monotheism Judaic mythology.

532
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:56,168
Rym: Yeah real big.

533
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,315
Scott: so that's what.

534
00:42:57,335 --> 00:42:58,120
Scott: that's what this is.

535
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:02,420
Scott: I'm probably gonna buy all the rest of them and then if there's a trade I'll probably buy all those.

536
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:04,392
Rym: Well good, cuz then I'll borrow them all from you.

537
00:43:04,412 --> 00:43:05,639
Scott: Yeah, as long as they keep it up.

538
00:43:05,941 --> 00:43:09,839
Scott: I mean Doug rush cough is like, you know, the amazing writer of writing.

539
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:19,209
Scott: so and oh the cover is just great because it shows this guy like he has his hand like kind of like almost in a fist like his fingers are clenched, but not a fist.

540
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:24,970
Scott: and You know, if you look at I've only seen the picture in like a thumbnail on the internet before I bought it.

541
00:43:25,432 --> 00:43:28,510
Scott: So it looked like a guy like, you know, there's a big bright light.

542
00:43:28,591 --> 00:43:30,029
Scott: So look kind of like a Bible pose.

543
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:36,393
Scott: But then you realize he's cutting this RFID out of his arm and it's like oh It's a combo.

544
00:43:36,835 --> 00:43:37,718
Rym: This sounds pretty cool.

545
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:38,039
Scott: Yep.

546
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,028
Scott: Now the last thing I bought is a very large $30 book.

547
00:43:43,902 --> 00:43:46,422
Scott: So I only reason I bought it for $30.

548
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:51,669
Scott: Well, one of the reasons I bought it was because I spent over $100 today Which means they get $20 in store credit.

549
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:53,319
Scott: So it was a $10 book for me.

550
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:07,548
Scott: Now you might be aware that you know, there are the Grammys for music the Oscars for movies comic books and other graphic Storytelling graphic novels and things have the Eisner Awards, right?

551
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:14,340
Scott: Now the Eisner Awards are not for Michael Eisner the Disney guy and You know, I never really knew who they were for.

552
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,939
Scott: I just knew there was a guy named Eisner who must have done some great comics, but you know, I didn't really know.

553
00:44:19,962 --> 00:44:27,080
Scott: That man is Will Eisner and he apparently wrote like the comics of all comic-dom and I haven't read a damn one.

554
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,694
Rym: Well considering that I have no idea what you're talking about.

555
00:44:29,714 --> 00:44:31,521
Rym: I Haven't read any either.

556
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:44,909
Scott: Well, the Eisner Awards are like the Grammys of comic books and Every year they give them out to like the best comics and graphic novels and things and if something wins an Eisner Award It's usually not gonna be some Marvel superhero book.

557
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:48,880
Scott: It's usually like a real serious graphic novel of quality, you know.

558
00:44:49,622 --> 00:44:57,606
Scott: and every year you'll see that there's one Eisner Award for like best imported foreign material and Things like Buddha will win.

559
00:44:57,646 --> 00:45:06,940
Scott: that you know, so that's why you don't see them bringing over Multiple awesome mangas in the same year because they want to spread the Eisner Awards everything that deserves it.

560
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:08,595
Scott: You know, they're thinking about that sort of thing.

561
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:16,840
Scott: But the Eisner Awards are because of Will Eisner who pretty much was the first person to make serious graphic novels.

562
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:20,008
Scott: Huh and they're mad high quality.

563
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,979
Scott: one of them that I don't have that I'm gonna get is actually about.

564
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:24,977
Scott: you know What was that?

565
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,585
Scott: The elders of Zion.

566
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:31,076
Scott: whole thing, you know with the Jewish conspiracy thing.

567
00:45:31,136 --> 00:45:35,520
Scott: He made a whole Graphic novel about that and I forget what it's called.

568
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:42,919
Scott: But if you see the cover of you'll probably recognize it like I saw the cover and I was like, oh that thing I know that cover, you know.

569
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,198
Scott: But I didn't actually know what it was until I read about it because I wanted to know.

570
00:45:47,084 --> 00:45:49,120
Scott: You know now that I'm doing more comics.

571
00:45:49,161 --> 00:45:50,052
Scott: I want to know what is about.

572
00:45:50,154 --> 00:46:05,880
Scott: but anyway I saw on the list of things that were coming out this week will Eisner the contract with God trilogy and It's apparently like the amazing work of his Legendary novel and sequels that launched a new art form.

573
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:10,180
Rym: I think you referred to it earlier today when you were telling me what you're gonna talk about on the show that this is like.

574
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,509
Rym: This isn't cane of comics.

575
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,240
Scott: if it's not this isn't cane of comics.

576
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:19,118
Scott: It sure is how it looks like it supposed to be, you know great enough to have the important awards named after him.

577
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,946
Scott: All right There's a quote by Scott McCloud.

578
00:46:22,966 --> 00:46:24,330
Rym: Oh god.

579
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:27,500
Scott: He says will Eisner is the heart and mind of American comics.

580
00:46:28,182 --> 00:46:28,343
Rym: Huh?

581
00:46:28,824 --> 00:46:30,390
Rym: I guess he said something intelligent for once.

582
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:34,970
Rym: Yeah, though apparently I hear I mean that guy was actually He said a lot of good things.

583
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:41,353
Rym: I'm selling recently that he's been kind of On the webcomics, yeah, we'll get into him someday.

584
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:43,360
Rym: if you read penny arcade, you know what that's all about.

585
00:46:43,661 --> 00:46:45,327
Scott: Yeah, we just agree with penny arcade.

586
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:50,947
Scott: Well because we like penny arcade and we don't like Scott McCloud's comics They're not funny or interesting to us.

587
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:54,780
Scott: So we just I guess by default side with whatever gave in tycos.

588
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:08,220
Rym: Well, plus I mean basically to sum up Scott McCloud is in an advocate of among other things Micropayments paying for comics online and we're of the mind that things like this podcast and things like penny arcade should be free.

589
00:47:08,924 --> 00:47:17,600
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I can spend all this time making this podcast I don't ask for any money and some guy who draws a webcomic occasionally shouldn't be asking for any money.

590
00:47:18,186 --> 00:47:28,790
Scott: I mean, come on, man Get with the times and don't tell me that you need to ask for money to make it big because penny arcade you lose They're loaded they give the comic away for free, you know what?

591
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,540
Rym: not even just then mega Tokyo all the big comics.

592
00:47:31,701 --> 00:47:33,538
Rym: Yeah, 8-bit theater makes a lot of money.

593
00:47:34,262 --> 00:47:38,600
Scott: So just cuz you're pissed off that the way they decided worked in the way you decided didn't work.

594
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,667
Scott: Don't keep claiming that they're doing it wrong.

595
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:41,871
Scott: Just mess up.

596
00:47:42,372 --> 00:47:44,680
Rym: Yeah, but we got off under a little tangent there.

597
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,487
Rym: We'll cover him in more detail someday.

598
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:51,803
Rym: Yep, but I guess to close out we got one little metabit Reader ship.

599
00:47:51,844 --> 00:47:55,500
Rym: well, I guess listenership is growing even though many of you aren't using the feed.

600
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,797
Rym: You're just going to the website, which is fine because that's what I do.

601
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:06,399
Rym: But uh, tell your friends We're kind of getting to that critical mass point and I could see the show exploding if we get a little bit of word-of-mouth.

602
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,979
Scott: Yeah, so if you go to any forums online besides ours, you know, just post a little link.

603
00:48:12,321 --> 00:48:20,595
Scott: If especially if something we said in the podcast is relevant to his discussion be like hey these guys in their podcast Episode something something set talked about this.

604
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:21,339
Scott: go listen to it.

605
00:48:21,862 --> 00:48:24,072
Rym: Of course, if you don't like us don't do that.

606
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:24,996
Scott: You don't like us.

607
00:48:25,016 --> 00:48:25,820
Scott: Why are you still listening?

608
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:41,687
Scott: you know, but Yeah, also if you're not in our forums Go to our forums front row crew calm Forum, they're actually really rocking.

609
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:54,060
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know if you like listening to this stuff Then I have to only assume that you have something to say about it or at least you're thinking, you know or giving an Nod, you know, we know you're out there.

610
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,060
Rym: We see how many of you download the episode and we see how many people are in the forums.

611
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:11,020
Scott: Yeah, and one of the numbers is a lot smaller than the other number and there's no way that we could be so Uncontroversial as to where everyone listening is just nodding in agreement has nothing contradictory or interesting to say or anything to add at all.

612
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:12,117
Rym: Because yeah, well we got.

613
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:21,679
Rym: well I mean recently the the biggest thing I've seen in the forum that is kind of Adversarial toward us is all of our scientific friends yelling at us about a description of viruses and how they work.

614
00:49:22,161 --> 00:49:22,402
Scott: Great.

615
00:49:22,825 --> 00:49:25,720
Rym: So if you want to see people make fun of us go to our forums.

616
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:36,165
Scott: Yeah Cuz you know we're so all knowing and we're so correct all the time that no one could possibly have anything to add or Contradict anything we ever say on this.

617
00:49:36,205 --> 00:49:39,936
Rym: No, in fact, did you realize that I am indeed a an almighty God?

618
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:41,240
Rym: really things.

619
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:46,337
Scott: Then why is it that my face appears in this comic where he's trying to depict God telling Abraham what?

620
00:49:46,357 --> 00:49:51,299
Rym: because you see I made It appear to be your face so that you would think that you were God when in actuality it is me.

621
00:49:51,883 --> 00:49:52,869
Scott: What kind of plan is that?

622
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:54,217
Scott: What kind of crappy God are you?

623
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:54,780
Rym: You know what?

624
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:01,811
Rym: that's the same kind of God who would uh plant fossils to trick people and Make a young universe but put light already in transit.

625
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:03,900
Rym: So you'd think the universe was older than it really was.

626
00:50:04,442 --> 00:50:09,560
Scott: That's the same kind of God who would put a pleasure dome in the middle of a waste disposal pipe.

627
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:21,251
Rym: And That was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
