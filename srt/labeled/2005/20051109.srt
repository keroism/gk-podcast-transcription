1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,486
Scott: It's Wednesday November 9th.

2
00:00:11,787 --> 00:00:13,010
Scott: This is deep nights.

3
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:18,452
Scott: It's anime night, but I want my parents house It's my mom's birthday, and I'm getting a free dinner.

4
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:23,056
Scott: so uh say yeah Let's not do this.

5
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:23,478
Rym: What?

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,023
Rym: uh yeah, you're not here.

7
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:25,766
Rym: Are you nope?

8
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:29,984
Scott: I'm in Connecticut Oh mom's birthday, and I'm at a restaurant eating.

9
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:35,983
Scott: Oh great So um I didn't think he'd be in the news again.

10
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:42,330
Scott: who Lawrence Olivier Jack Thompson Jack Thompson Jack Thompson Jack Thompson.

11
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,757
Scott: So you know he's doing that.

12
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,850
Scott: he's doing that wrongful death case against rockstar games.

13
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:51,490
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I think it's the kid who killed the cops or something.

14
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,819
Rym: Yeah, and he's saying that the kid did it because of Grand Theft Auto.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,687
Scott: right trained him to do it whatever right.

16
00:00:56,048 --> 00:01:04,068
Scott: so the suit is in Alabama and basically for the past week Jack Thompson hasn't been actually doing the case.

17
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:20,050
Scott: well it's been part of the case, but he's been defending his ethical conduct to the judge and The judge actually Considered a motion to disbar Jack Thompson in Alabama.

18
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,380
Scott: Well, and he's even considered that he would throw the case out.

19
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,996
Scott: So Jack Thompson said well to save the case.

20
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,280
Scott: I'm gonna quit the case and some other lawyer can do it.

21
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,758
Scott: Really that doesn't help the case at all.

22
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:39,540
Scott: well I guess it does help the case cuz Jack Thompson's not on it, but it's mostly to save face.

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,085
Scott: But he's saying oh, it's for the case.

24
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:47,087
Rym: Yeah as opposed to oh, I'm a crazy fuck and People called me on it this time.

25
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:55,060
Scott: Yeah, I don't think he's gonna be um Winning any cases ever again unless he you know does some real law.

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,018
Rym: Yeah, yeah Except the only thing he really has going now is this video game thing.

27
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:05,120
Scott: Well cuz he used to be all about movies and comics and all you know anything that was bad for kids.

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,310
Scott: But lately he just concentrates in the video games.

29
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:09,240
Scott: cuz he has this idea that they're somehow different.

30
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:16,040
Rym: You know I don't think he realized what kind of a hornet's nest he was provoking when he went after video games.

31
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:19,605
Scott: Yeah, you know But I can kind of see where he's coming from.

32
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:24,902
Scott: sometimes cuz he says stuff like all those video game guys from you know Hollywood.

33
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:29,280
Scott: they're all paying off the government, and we're always complaining like oh those record company guys.

34
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:33,751
Scott: He feels the same way we feel, but he's wrong in this case.

35
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:42,159
Rym: yeah, even though those things may or may not be happening I don't see it happening so much because it's not like the government tries to regulate video games so often.

36
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:43,744
Scott: Now it doesn't.

37
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:44,887
Scott: but that's the thing is like.

38
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:50,783
Scott: he's saying that the only reason they're not regulating video games is because the video game Companies they're making

39
00:02:51,124 --> 00:03:09,211
Rym: you know not because there's more important issues like drugs, or I don't know terror wars Budgets welfare Disease poverty Gary mandarin Every real problem in the world that isn't a video game.

40
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,420
Scott: yeah, yeah, I don't know.

41
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,303
Scott: I never liked that.

42
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:14,390
Scott: there's a worst thing argument.

43
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:20,839
Scott: You know because there really isn't that much worse than Jack Thompson Jack Thompson Jack Thompson.

44
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,559
Rym: So remember the other day when those pirates attacked that cruise ship.

45
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:38,720
Rym: It turned into geek because apparently The news is reporting now that part of the reason they got away is because they use this LRAD or long-range acoustic device to scare the pirates off.

46
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,298
Scott: Why do they have one?

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,580
Rym: It's like actually because there's a law an international treaty stating that you can't have heavy weapons on ships at sea unless there were ships.

48
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:53,000
Rym: So a cruise ship can't have like an anti-aircraft gun there to mow down anyone.

49
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:58,484
Rym: It can't have a reason in case some pirates come so They can't have real weapons.

50
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:03,300
Rym: They gotta have fake weapons, so they have these non-lethal things that don't count as weapons like LRAD.

51
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:05,667
Rym: Oh, all right, and it's just don't like.

52
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:08,636
Scott: doesn't the crew have like you know handheld weapons or something?

53
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:10,060
Rym: those aren't so useful against pirates.

54
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:13,239
Scott: No, like you know pistol machine gun something those.

55
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,492
Rym: well They can't really have machine guns.

56
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:19,156
Rym: some of them do But they don't really help because the pirates stay way back and shoot rocket-propelled grenades at you.

57
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:20,416
Scott: ah Yeah

58
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:34,089
Rym: Apparently all these devices do is they're big disk looking things and they point them at someone and when they hit the button it Directs a very focused beam of sound like you could be standing next to this thing in front of it And you won't hear a thing walk in front of it.

59
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,160
Rym: It'll knock you unconscious and do permanent hearing damage.

60
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:38,799
Scott: Great is there a warning sign?

61
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,342
Rym: Don't know.

62
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,694
Rym: actually the military has been using them in Baghdad to control rioters.

63
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:45,119
Scott: Yeah, I heard something about that.

64
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:46,028
Scott: Does it work?

65
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,200
Rym: it works real?

66
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,398
Rym: Well it causes people to fall over and scream in horrible pain and vomit.

67
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:58,595
Rym: it Supposedly sounds like a smoke alarm and it'll be about up to a hundred and fifty decibels in your ear.

68
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:04,540
Rym: Oh Yeah, that's more than the space shuttle launching at some distance.

69
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:08,906
Rym: Yeah

70
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:24,355
Scott: I heard a thing on NPR about these a while back, but they were talking about him in Shortly after the hurricanes in Louisiana and I think they were demoing them like just outside or they were using them there to get looters and stuff

71
00:05:24,376 --> 00:05:24,777
Rym: uh-huh,

72
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:32,470
Scott: but the one specific one they talked about was slightly Different because what they were doing is they were shooting it really far.

73
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:41,225
Scott: They're talking like like miles away even you know if not like thousands of feet Yeah, and they weren't sending noise to knock you out even though they could.

74
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:43,790
Scott: they were sending like Like messages.

75
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,464
Scott: it's like if you what they were talking about was like if a guy's on a roof.

76
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:56,070
Scott: you could be in the helicopter and you Could pretty much shoot a laser of sound at him saying You know we're coming to get you and it would sound like you were right next to him talking.

77
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:57,639
Scott: So no one has to yell.

78
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,108
Scott: No one has to use a megaphone.

79
00:05:59,168 --> 00:05:59,389
Scott: No it.

80
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:05,348
Rym: I think it's similar because this one it says the effective range of damaging or stopping people is about 500 meters.

81
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:07,577
Rym: I imagine you can still hear it.

82
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:08,942
Rym: beyond that it just doesn't hurt you.

83
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:10,910
Scott: Yeah, they were talking about you know.

84
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,581
Scott: let's say you know there's someone way out, and you're an army.

85
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:15,163
Scott: you could be like.

86
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:23,410
Scott: you know halt who goes there and such and You know you would be able to give them fair warning and all the or you could pull some wicked pranks on people.

87
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:26,349
Scott: You could totally pull some wicked pranks.

88
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:28,314
Scott: We should get one.

89
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:30,564
Rym: I wonder how to be to make one.

90
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:33,147
Scott: I Don't know if it's a makeable thing.

91
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:35,034
Rym: Well, everything's makeable.

92
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:37,360
Rym: It's just a matter of our resources.

93
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,727
Scott: I don't think RadioShack's got enough.

94
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,570
Rym: nah Yeah, apparently they've used these things in Baghdad.

95
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:50,105
Rym: They used them in New York City during the 2004 Republican National Convention.

96
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:51,430
Scott: really I didn't hear about that.

97
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,441
Rym: I think they just demoed them.

98
00:06:53,148 --> 00:07:04,123
Scott: oh Yeah, it seems like they've done a lot of demos in dangerous situations, but I you know the actual use hasn't been Prominent enough for people to make a big thing about it.

99
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:05,630
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's.

100
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,557
Rym: It's good and bad.

101
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:08,381
Rym: I mean on one hand.

102
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:11,195
Rym: It's a good idea because Non-lethal is always good.

103
00:07:11,216 --> 00:07:11,979
Rym: It doesn't kill people.

104
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:23,603
Rym: you always give someone a second chance, but on the other hand I think law enforcement will be more readily Predisposed to using things like this if they know that it won't kill anyone.

105
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:24,245
Scott: well.

106
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:29,058
Scott: That's always the Story with any sort of non-lethal weapon.

107
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:29,900
Scott: I mean just today.

108
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:42,737
Scott: I read a story about these less dangerous cigarettes right and Every and the one smart guy who commented on it was like no even if they're a zillion times safer Which I guess they kind of were.

109
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:46,290
Scott: they have like these new filters that only let nicotine through and stuff right?

110
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,910
Scott: He's like back in the 70s and they added filters and stuff and they took out all the tar.

111
00:07:51,431 --> 00:08:00,520
Scott: People just started smoking more and taking longer drags, and it didn't actually make it any safer You know yeah, so it's like all right.

112
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:04,669
Scott: if you make stuff less potent people do it more And it's always the same potency.

113
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:17,750
Scott: So if you have a non-lethal You know sound gun There'll be more apt to use it And they'll use it like ten times on the same guy And then he'll die like we've seen with tasers lately.

114
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:22,630
Rym: Oh every day in the news someone gets tasered like a little girl or old lady or a dog.

115
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:24,428
Rym: Though actually the tasers?

116
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:28,116
Rym: now There's two cool things that are come out New tasers that the police use.

117
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:32,190
Rym: take a picture when you fire them that can't be removed of what you're firing at.

118
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:40,489
Rym: So if you just taser someone ten times There's gonna be a picture of the guy on the ground obviously unconscious as you're about to taser him again.

119
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:42,576
Scott: No, so it'll store all the pictures.

120
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:43,880
Rym: Yes, whoo.

121
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:44,763
Rym: There's another one.

122
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,790
Scott: Can you cover the picture with like your finger or something?

123
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,868
Rym: I don't think they're allowed to.

124
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:53,329
Rym: They'd be kind of suspect if you taser two guy five times and magically the last three pictures your finger was in the way.

125
00:08:55,472 --> 00:09:00,168
Rym: And the other thing to protect civilians from like because a lot of muggers apparently use these things to get someone.

126
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:00,850
Rym: just take their wallet.

127
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:12,750
Rym: They've got some that have these Thousands of tiny pieces of confetti with serial numbers on them and when you fire it It shoots the taser and it's it just pops these things out with a co2 cartridge everywhere.

128
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:16,401
Scott: So then if the police come they find the serial number.

129
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:17,383
Scott: they find out who you were.

130
00:09:17,404 --> 00:09:19,912
Rym: they can at least track where the taser came From.

131
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:20,779
Scott: it's pretty good.

132
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:22,229
Scott: I have bullets that do that.

133
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,113
Rym: They're trying there's.

134
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:27,630
Rym: there's been an effort for the last couple decades to have some sort of registry of fingerprinted bullets.

135
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,787
Scott: Well, I mean they can do it with what do they call it?

136
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:37,387
Scott: with the The where they match the bullet by Matt, you know, cuz the bullets from the same gun are all ballistics.

137
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:46,070
Scott: Yep ballistic Such as I knew is a B. But you know, they should just put a serial number on every bullet.

138
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:51,776
Rym: Well, then where I do is all I have to do is file it off my bullet Put it in the bullet.

139
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:57,022
Rym: where in the bullet in on the backseat is the bullet You mean in the shell casing that I'll take with me?

140
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:58,147
Scott: no, no, no, no.

141
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:01,690
Scott: There's the bullet and there's the shell casing and then there's a gun powder.

142
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,615
Rym: I want to put it on the bullet.

143
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:05,329
Scott: put it on the bottom of the bullet that's covered by the shell.

144
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,203
Rym: The only problem with that is that bullets get really really deformed when they hit you.

145
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:16,710
Scott: they do but the back of it You see the part that that's you know, that I guess the explosion the gunpowder might take it off.

146
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,199
Scott: It's a tough one.

147
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,807
Rym: Yeah, people are working on it But the taser one is a nice very practical very elegant solution to a real problem.

148
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:25,630
Scott: Yeah, very good.

149
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:26,393
Rym: I'm very happy.

150
00:10:26,413 --> 00:10:28,945
Rym: whatever people use science instead of legislation to solve something.

151
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:29,689
Scott: Mm-hmm.

152
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:33,560
Rym: Though there is one other cool thing about these all our ads.

153
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:36,190
Rym: apparently there are a lot of non weapon uses.

154
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:45,943
Rym: They're starting to use them in concerts and in stadiums to project sound to people who are far away Without having to have it so loud that it kills people in the front.

155
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:47,450
Scott: That's pretty good.

156
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,267
Scott: You know what else at the concerts where they could do is you know how?

157
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:59,289
Scott: um You'll be at a show and like the guy who's doing the show will try to talk to someone in the audience Specific and they won't hear him or vice versa.

158
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:19,574
Scott: Yeah You could just go around to like a microphone and an l-rad Right and the person on stage could like point the l-rad at a person in the audience and be like hey you Something something something, you know, and then that person could be like something something You know, I could be pretty cool get a whole new level of Interaction going on.

159
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:23,810
Rym: Yeah, I'd like to see the next five years as this technology gets developed.

160
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,136
Scott: Yeah, hopefully it'll be cheaper.

161
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:34,046
Scott: So like people can buy them and use them and play horrible pranks play horrible pranks is good You know, you can call for pizza with it.

162
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:38,069
Rym: Well a blockbuster video isn't doing so well.

163
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:52,149
Rym: they've lost millions and millions 500 million in the last couple months and They're probably gonna go bankrupt because it looks like all their investors and all their lenders are starting to recall all their loans.

164
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,369
Scott: Blockbuster had five hundred million dollars.

165
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,188
Rym: blockbuster makes approximately four point three three billion dollars a year.

166
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:06,082
Rym: Wow, the apparently the entire rental industry is collapsing.

167
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:09,270
Rym: I wonder why internet Netflix TiVo.

168
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:14,742
Rym: But uh Blockbusters collapsing slower and yeah on demand.

169
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:17,110
Rym: My blockbuster is doing the best of all of them.

170
00:12:17,472 --> 00:12:19,807
Rym: It's only collapsing half as fast as everyone else.

171
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:27,238
Rym: But the thing is they're not blaming Netflix they're not blaming the internet.

172
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,023
Rym: No, they're.

173
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:31,650
Rym: I don't think they have any idea why they're losing their business.

174
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:39,357
Rym: they're talking about how the revenues are only down because they got rid of their late fees and They're blaming like the economy's kind of down.

175
00:12:39,397 --> 00:12:42,166
Rym: so people aren't renting videos like they used to what.

176
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,312
Scott: yeah, you know This reminds me.

177
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:45,776
Scott: they just have no idea.

178
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:52,794
Scott: This reminds me back in the day like in the in the dot-com boom like in like 90 Like it's 97 98.

179
00:12:52,794 --> 00:13:07,702
Scott: Yeah, there was a guy and he it was in the Silicon Alley which is you know, the Silicon Valley in New York, whatever kind of mag trade magazine, right and This is the most dot-com boom you could get.

180
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:18,530
Scott: I mean this magazine was this free thing I got because I lied about being an industry insider and There's this article about which companies are doing good on the internet and which companies are doing bad.

181
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:24,575
Scott: All right, and they talked about these companies doing great things like oh look at the website for this company You can do all these innovative stuff.

182
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:28,610
Scott: and then the number one worst company was blockbuster.

183
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:33,830
Scott: Because blockbuster they were like look at what blockbuster could be doing on the internet.

184
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:34,713
Scott: Oh my god.

185
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:41,319
Scott: searching for videos checking which videos are in stock and which stores checking your late fees Getting registrations.

186
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:41,983
Scott: Oh my god.

187
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:43,290
Scott: finding store locations.

188
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:49,088
Scott: And in those days the blockbuster website was pretty much like this static page with company info.

189
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:53,679
Scott: and they had a website Barely and that was what the guy was saying.

190
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:56,390
Scott: is that blockbuster was just so behind the times?

191
00:13:57,232 --> 00:14:00,381
Scott: You know internet wise and I guess it hasn't changed.

192
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:01,684
Scott: they haven't fired their.

193
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:04,713
Scott: it's like oh I can't understand.

194
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:10,309
Rym: Yeah, even the article is like blockbusters facing tough competition from Netflix blah blah blah blah.

195
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:11,773
Rym: Walmart Blah blah blah.

196
00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:14,140
Scott: Oh, yeah Walmart with their cheap DVD sale.

197
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,647
Rym: Yeah, they're real cheap TV, but they're very poor selection.

198
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:20,743
Rym: Yes But blockbusters even trying to spin this in a good light.

199
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:31,810
Rym: They're saying things like This just means we're we're consolidating the markets consolidating and We're gaining market share because all the mom and pops are going out of business and the only ones left are blocking.

200
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:36,519
Scott: But the mom pops had a business 15 20 years now, there's still some mom and pops about.

201
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,295
Scott: there's still some but those are usually video bars that carry stuff that Blockbuster won't care.

202
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,706
Rym: and summers in the Midwest mammoth video still around.

203
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:44,429
Scott: I never heard of that.

204
00:14:44,711 --> 00:14:45,557
Rym: Mammoth video was.

205
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:46,806
Rym: I had never heard a blockbuster.

206
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:51,230
Rym: when I was a little kid We had mammoth video and there were a bunch of them all over the Hollywood video.

207
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:56,354
Rym: Yeah, they have like they've been around they're still around but they're not doing so well No, I'm not doing well at all.

208
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:57,759
Scott: But I heard in my town.

209
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,609
Scott: It was like there weren't any chain video stores.

210
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,310
Scott: yet There was just this one video place.

211
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,615
Scott: It was kind of small but they had you know all the major movies and that was it You know and people would go there.

212
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:10,486
Scott: and it was like some people would do it and some people wouldn't.

213
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:13,077
Scott: kind of like today Some people have TiVo some people don't.

214
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:16,470
Scott: yeah, you know, it's like you were either in on renting or you weren't God?

215
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,066
Rym: I remember going where there were only two stores one had beta and one had VHS.

216
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:21,934
Scott: Oh, wow He didn't have a beta store.

217
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:29,881
Scott: Yeah, but then this blockbuster opened and it was a little far away from the house like 15 minutes away, but it was huge and we were went to.

218
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:38,117
Scott: the grand opening is one of the first blockbusters and Everyone got a blockbuster membership Absolutely everyone.

219
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,729
Scott: and then they started opening up everywhere.

220
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:48,639
Scott: But then as soon as more of them opened they became a lot less spectacular And people didn't care about them as much and we started renting less, you know, you didn't.

221
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:57,360
Rym: you know When the NES kind of went away, you know, really God I rented more NES games from blockbusters than I did movies and anything else.

222
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,315
Scott: Yeah game renting kind of went away.

223
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:03,650
Scott: cuz you know No one wanted to rent really Sega Genesis SNES games so much.

224
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:07,620
Rym: and then when the ps1 came out people started copying those.

225
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,624
Scott: Yeah, we all right.

226
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:09,447
Scott: I remember ps1.

227
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:11,595
Scott: We go you rent we burn we go back.

228
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:12,820
Scott: All right, we burn we go back.

229
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:20,375
Rym: I don't know what it is with the the plebeians out there who rent videos But how come every DVD and blockbuster was scratched to hell?

230
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:21,279
Rym: What do they do?

231
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:21,941
Scott: Well, it's cuz.

232
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:24,753
Scott: people just don't know that a DVD is a scratchable things.

233
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:26,541
Scott: you you can't make something That's.

234
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,128
Scott: how can you not know that?

235
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:31,180
Scott: and the other thing is that they don't know how it works.

236
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,844
Scott: They don't know that the laser that actually looks at the disc and if it's crashed It'll see it differently.

237
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:39,680
Rym: but think with cartridges and like a cartridge would last forever.

238
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:41,373
Rym: So you could rent cartridges to people.

239
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:43,326
Rym: just fine Pls1 discs.

240
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,640
Rym: rent it to five fanboys and it's done.

241
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:48,769
Scott: The other thing is though is that people want it to be that way.

242
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,962
Scott: not people but the record companies will and the movie companies That way.

243
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,692
Scott: if you scratch it you say my DVD stopped working.

244
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:57,919
Scott: nine out of ten idiots go and buy it again.

245
00:16:58,382 --> 00:17:05,538
Rym: Yeah, or they'll buy a special edition where Someone other than Han Solo shoots first.

246
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:11,773
Rym: God Yeah for posterity, you know what Han Solo shot first.

247
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,968
Rym: I don't care what you see I don't care what back into the hand.

248
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:18,723
Scott: solo shot first and not only did he shoot first Greedo I don't think he shot at all.

249
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:20,511
Rym: No Greedo wasn't even gonna shoot.

250
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,515
Rym: He just had his gun out.

251
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:22,960
Scott: Yeah to be all menacing.

252
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:25,665
Rym: Well moving on to the main bit.

253
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:26,768
Rym: It's anime night.

254
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:36,557
Rym: And since I've run out of previously recorded clips involving Scott I'm gonna have to do the rest of the show on my own since as you are well aware Him and his wonderful banter aren't here to help me.

255
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:40,168
Rym: Thus sadly, there's only one thing of the day today.

256
00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:42,294
Rym: And my thing of the day is fairly cool.

257
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,520
Rym: It's not anything particularly new.

258
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:46,514
Rym: I'm sure people have seen it before but for anyone who hasn't?

259
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:52,080
Rym: I Stumbled across a small archive of Lego figures, but not just any Lego figures.

260
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:55,676
Rym: These are Lego representations of Cthulhu himself.

261
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:04,611
Rym: now There's not much more I can actually really say about them considering that Cthulhu is one of those formless Indescribable terrors that cause nothing but insanity and all to see them.

262
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,880
Rym: But uh, if you're interested check out the link.

263
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:16,839
Rym: But anyway regarding anime, I haven't started watching anything new though I'm still watching mushishi which as far as I'm concerned is really the best show out there currently.

264
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:23,082
Rym: but we just got a DVD one of big O in the house again and It's old.

265
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:23,725
Rym: It's campy.

266
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:24,488
Rym: It's over the top.

267
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:25,351
Rym: But you know what?

268
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:25,893
Rym: I love it.

269
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:32,300
Rym: And for any of you haven't seen big O It's Probably one of the stupidest sounding shows you will ever hear about.

270
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:39,080
Rym: There's a big robot called big O and it fights other big robots and there's lots and lots of collateral damage.

271
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,240
Rym: That's really it but it's a great show.

272
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:54,400
Rym: I mean the best thing about it wasn't so much the show itself But the context of watching it because when I first saw it I saw it with a crowd of people at an anime club and if this show is anything it's a crowd-pleaser.

273
00:18:55,121 --> 00:19:03,611
Rym: Now I've seen the whole show before already and the only reason I'm watching it again is because it's been a while and I actually never saw the sequel big O - and neither is Scott.

274
00:19:04,152 --> 00:19:07,224
Rym: So we're gonna watch all the big O one because Face it.

275
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:07,947
Rym: It's an awesome show.

276
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:15,759
Rym: It's giant robots punching other giant robots in the face And then we're gonna watch big O - which everyone we've known who's seen it said is really good.

277
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:21,460
Rym: But we just never got around to watching it and I got to say as much as I complain about being out of college.

278
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:27,665
Rym: One of the big benefits of being out here in the working world is that I actually have a chance to just sit down and Watch all that anime.

279
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:33,256
Rym: I missed while I was too busy running anime clubs back in the day And actually even better than the anime itself.

280
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:43,879
Rym: now I actually have enough money, you know since I have a job to afford to go to events like Otakon or anime central without having to rely on the sympathy of others for basic necessities like food.

281
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:56,060
Rym: Now I've been watching anime for a long time and I've been going to anime conventions for a long time And I figured since Scott's not here and I like the sound of my own voice.

282
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:07,046
Rym: I'll just kind of give you guys a background as to how I got into this thing and why I love it so much and why to this day I'm still very deeply immersed in the Subculture that is anime.

283
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:21,380
Rym: So the year was well, I actually don't know what year it was but I was in fourth grade back when I was still living in Detroit and I happened to catch Vampire hunter D on the sci-fi channel and at the time I wasn't really sure what it was.

284
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:28,746
Rym: all I knew was that I liked it and I wanted to see more and the sci-fi channel luckily obliged me right after that.

285
00:20:28,786 --> 00:20:38,336
Rym: they showed a robot carnival and then Dominion tank police and then project echo and Then kashan robot hunter and then like three or four other shows.

286
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,680
Rym: now I should probably note at this time that kashan robot hunter is one of the worst anime ever.

287
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:46,054
Rym: So don't even think about watching it if you've never heard of it.

288
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:47,300
Rym: the world has done you a favor.

289
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:56,960
Rym: so as the years went on I picked up and started watching all the anime I could find and I saw almost all the anime I could get as a result.

290
00:20:57,481 --> 00:21:00,431
Rym: I remember watching eska flown a as it came out every month.

291
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:06,514
Rym: We'd buy the next VHS tape watch it and then Furiously wait for the next one now at this point.

292
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:13,553
Rym: I really liked anime In fact, I loved it But I had no idea that there was actually this sort of subculture connected to it.

293
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:15,418
Rym: I didn't know about fansubbers.

294
00:21:15,438 --> 00:21:18,027
Rym: I Didn't know about conventions.

295
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:18,850
Rym: I had no idea.

296
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:21,380
Rym: I didn't know that there was anything to it other than watching this anime.

297
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:33,169
Rym: Then I got to RIT and I walked into the RIT anime club's first yearly recruitment meeting and I saw this auditorium Absolutely filled with geeks.

298
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:45,000
Rym: It was then that I knew that I was home So I made a bunch of friends in the club and Then not too long after I went to my first anime convention, which was actually Ohio con.

299
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:46,729
Rym: It wasn't the greatest convention.

300
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,620
Rym: In fact, it was pretty piss poor.

301
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,360
Rym: I've heard that Ohio con is much better now, but back then let me tell you they didn't check badges.

302
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:55,206
Rym: There wasn't much going on.

303
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:57,233
Rym: There were prostitutes at the hotel.

304
00:21:57,353 --> 00:21:59,300
Rym: That's a story for another time, but they were there.

305
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:02,891
Rym: Ohio con did have one cool thing going for it though.

306
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:21,260
Rym: They had an old-school Original NES duck hunt tournament and they're having trouble getting people to sign up But me and my Scott and a bunch of other people we knew We're all in the room and they all told us hey join the tournament You don't even have to pay just join because they needed bodies.

307
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:21,922
Rym: so whatever.

308
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:22,945
Rym: and they have this.

309
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:32,069
Rym: they have the duck hunt card for the gun as fully extended as it can be in this tiny little TV and The first guy goes up and he misses a bunch of ducks.

310
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:35,380
Rym: and then the next guy goes up and he misses a bunch of ducks.

311
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:37,385
Rym: And we're thinking to ourselves.

312
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:39,513
Rym: Uh, oh, this may be hard.

313
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:45,840
Rym: I mean I have the duck hunt skills, but Maybe the maximum distance factor is making it too difficult.

314
00:22:46,922 --> 00:22:53,229
Rym: so then I get up there and I hit every duck and Then Scott goes up and he also hits every duck.

315
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:56,140
Rym: and then our friend Katsu goes up and he hits every duck.

316
00:22:57,401 --> 00:23:08,255
Rym: So people are getting eliminated and eventually it comes to the point that there is no way to eliminate any of us With ducks because we hit every duck no matter what we hit every skeet no matter what there's.

317
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:11,736
Rym: just it's gonna go on forever Until one of us passes out.

318
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:19,620
Rym: So they decide to in the spirit of old school Have the final championship be determined by the original Mario Brothers.

319
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:30,309
Rym: so Scott and I sit down and we're fighting for first and second place and They just we started going at it and they didn't really tell us what the objective was.

320
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:37,659
Rym: So we're playing and I turned to the guy who's running and I asked him so, uh What do we have to do?

321
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,210
Rym: He says whoever gets the most points wins.

322
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:42,779
Rym: So then I asked can I kill Scott's guy?

323
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:44,565
Rym: and the guy responds?

324
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:49,421
Rym: Uh If you kill him, he can't get any more points now, can he?

325
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:58,918
Rym: and I immediately pushed Scott into a green fireball And I won first place Scott won second place Katsu won third place and That is the only good story.

326
00:23:58,978 --> 00:24:01,590
Rym: I have out of Ohio con other than the prostitutes.

327
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:04,189
Rym: So Ohio con was okay, but it wasn't great.

328
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:15,550
Rym: then we discovered Otakon and I cannot express to you unless you have been there the sheer magnitude of the geekery that goes on at Otakon.

329
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:22,807
Rym: That I mean, it's an anime convention, but every aspect of geekery is represented there in quantity.

330
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:23,749
Rym: in fact.

331
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:30,330
Rym: We've been to every Otakon since that first one we went to and we plan to go to every Otakon pretty much until we die.

332
00:24:31,691 --> 00:24:36,770
Rym: So, I mean I still watch anime and I love anime but like when I go to these conventions like Otakon.

333
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:40,720
Rym: I don't watch a single frame of anime while I'm there.

334
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:51,870
Rym: I Pretty much just go to hang out with all the cool people I've met as a result of anime and That's really the main reason why anime is still such a big part of my life.

335
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:55,910
Rym: It's not the anime itself because I could just watch that alone in my house if I really wanted.

336
00:24:56,551 --> 00:25:04,810
Rym: it's that community of a lot of people who like this very geeky thing and Like it together and have a sort of shared culture.

337
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:11,469
Rym: I mean I share more culturally with all the people at Otakon than I do with the people who actually live next door to me.

338
00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:18,170
Rym: Now I don't have much more to really say on this topic without some sort of witty interactive banter with Scott.

339
00:25:18,795 --> 00:25:31,509
Rym: So I guess I'll leave you with My Grimms top 10 anime that I really like Which is actually hard to do because I guess I separate anime I like from anime that I think are good.

340
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:48,921
Rym: I mean if someone asked me to name the top five anime or the five anime I think are the best Hands-down, it would be Cowboy Bebop Evangelion Escaflowne, Trigun, and Fullmetal Alchemist with nods to things like Lain And a lot of people tend to agree on that point.

341
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:52,709
Rym: a lot of people disagree about the order But a lot of people agree that those are very very good shows.

342
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:57,392
Rym: But if you ask me what my favorite anime are they would be Irresponsible.

343
00:25:57,452 --> 00:26:03,649
Rym: Captain Tyler and Shoujo Kakamei Utena, which I won't pretend that they're the best shows in the world, but I like them.

344
00:26:04,794 --> 00:26:05,929
Rym: Now to get a little bit meta.

345
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:18,265
Rym: It's interesting because I've never actually tried to do this sort of podcast thing by myself and I didn't realize how difficult it is to just sit in front of a microphone with no audience.

346
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:28,229
Rym: No feedback whatsoever absolutely no idea of how what I'm saying sounds or how interesting it actually is and To just sit here and rant for a while.

347
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:33,950
Rym: I mean, I love the sound of my own voice But I only love the sound of my own voice when I know that other people are listening to it.

348
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,163
Rym: And while I know people are listening to this now, I can't see you now.

349
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:46,782
Rym: I can't see you roll your eyes So I'll realize that a joke I made is bad or I can't see Scott Doing his Scott things and it.

350
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:58,640
Rym: it's actually really hard to do this by myself and I remember Scott said a while ago when he tried to do something like this a long time ago that he had a similar problem and Now I see where he was coming from.

351
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:03,770
Rym: it's hard to Do a monologue without any feedback.

352
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:18,390
Rym: So in the interest of saving all of you from my wonderful melodious voice I'll just roll into some more clips that I have handy with Scott and I'll call it a day digital digital.

353
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:22,001
Scott: We should record in 5.1 just for the fuck of it.

354
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:29,024
Rym: I was thinking of switching to Recording joint stereo and put you a little bit to the right me a little bit to the left.

355
00:27:29,285 --> 00:27:30,430
Scott: that works or vice versa.

356
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:36,130
Rym: Yeah, we'll do something like that because it makes it nicer to listen to even though people usually can't figure out why it sounds nicer.

357
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,215
Rym: They're like, hey, it sounds better.

358
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:37,918
Rym: I don't know why.

359
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,490
Scott: yeah, a lot of people have the joint stereo podcast.

360
00:27:40,732 --> 00:27:41,829
Scott: I'm actually ones with music.

361
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:46,327
Rym: Well now that we're using resound which works as opposed to audacity, which doesn't work as well.

362
00:27:46,347 --> 00:27:52,970
Rym: Yep But the only matter we really have is that we need feedback about the show.

363
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:59,490
Scott: Yeah, I know there are some people listening and I know a lot of them are people who know us anyway and no offense.

364
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:01,319
Rym: But all anyone tells us is either.

365
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,585
Rym: Yeah, you guys are hilarious.

366
00:28:02,665 --> 00:28:06,909
Rym: or yeah, keep it up or yeah I listen but no one says like oh, but this needs work.

367
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:19,486
Scott: So right now basically what we're doing is we're going on our own Instincts and trying to change the show based on what we think is good what we think is bad But who are we to judge something that you know isn't for us?

368
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:26,773
Rym: Yeah We change it a lot today if I don't notice that we try to do a better job of explaining what we're talking about Before we talk about it.

369
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:39,117
Scott: Yeah, and we did a better job of not, you know rambling off and different topics that aren't related Yeah, and things like that, you know and sticking to the game plan Yeah, we actually did some pre-production.

370
00:28:39,257 --> 00:28:41,545
Scott: Yeah, and knowing the facts of what we're talking about.

371
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:42,207
Scott: So we don't go.

372
00:28:42,227 --> 00:28:44,689
Scott: Oh, yeah Well, what I don't know I didn't read it.

373
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:47,378
Rym: You know we were both guilty.

374
00:28:47,438 --> 00:28:51,960
Scott: Oh, yeah, but besides the obvious stuff, you know We want to know what people want to hear.

375
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:52,865
Scott: What's the good parts?

376
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:53,810
Scott: What's the bad parts?

377
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,029
Scott: You know who we really need is an idea of what to do on Monday.

378
00:28:57,531 --> 00:29:01,385
Rym: Yeah, cuz we've tried a bunch of ideas and we've got Tuesdays and Wednesdays down.

379
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:02,930
Rym: We're golden on Tuesday and Wednesday.

380
00:29:03,252 --> 00:29:05,849
Rym: I can talk about video games for like two days straight.

381
00:29:06,452 --> 00:29:14,707
Scott: Yeah, but you know, we've got you know, the three major geekeries can be pretty much separated into Rwag anime club in EGS.

382
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:21,601
Scott: Yeah You've got anime club in EGS but the our wag gaming type stuff which we're into.

383
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:29,446
Scott: but there's not really enough of it that you can Talk a whole lot about D&D and for games and stuff for D&D news.

384
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:30,429
Rym: Is there what happens in D&D?

385
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,834
Rym: I never even seen.

386
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,501
Rym: yeah 3.5 edition.

387
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:35,589
Scott: I mean, it's like a book comes out.

388
00:29:36,496 --> 00:29:38,070
Scott: Something happens in a campaign world.

389
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,946
Scott: These aren't you know, we like D&D, but these aren't things that we can talk about weekly for like 20 30 40 minutes.

390
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:47,390
Scott: Yeah, you know, I mean we could talk about old campaigns.

391
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,802
Scott: We could talk about games are playing now if we had more people and you're actually playing them.

392
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:53,808
Rym: Yeah, but we're not so much.

393
00:29:54,229 --> 00:30:00,910
Scott: Yeah So we need something to fill the Mondays and then of course we fill the Thursdays with whatever the heck we want craziness.

394
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:06,790
Rym: Yep, we're thinking of trying to make for Thursdays for a while once we get going interview days where we pick someone to interview them.

395
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:13,010
Scott: But you know, we need to set up some sort of interviewing technology and we need to find people to interview.

396
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:19,090
Scott: So I guess if you're out there and you are someone who is interesting to interview you can get in contact with us.

397
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,873
Scott: Maybe we can.

398
00:30:20,074 --> 00:30:25,353
Scott: you know that we're thinking of setting up the Skype or some team speak even though I don't trust the Skype But there's the Bioware.

399
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:30,810
Rym: Yeah, of course one thing anyone who lives near us we can just do an interview.

400
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:34,424
Scott: Yeah, we might if you're live like a half hour away or closer or something.

401
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:35,890
Scott: We might come out to see you or something.

402
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,856
Rym: Yeah, bring her a little mixer.

403
00:30:37,138 --> 00:30:37,259
Scott: Yes.

404
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,949
Rym: We're always looking for fun things to do like that.

405
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:40,937
Scott: Yeah, definitely looking for people in the area.

406
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,350
Rym: Anyway, but maybe we'll head out to Rochester and do the old alma mater.

407
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:54,217
Scott: Yeah, but basically what it comes down to is if you're listening to this and we don't know you already and you don't know us Go to our forum on front row.

408
00:30:54,257 --> 00:30:57,308
Scott: crew calm email us GeekNights at gmail.com.

00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,682
Rym: Yeah, if you're a hacker and you find our cell phone numbers call us call us.

410
00:31:01,722 --> 00:31:02,364
Scott: We don't care.

Scott: you do something You know.

00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:06,362
Scott: get in contact with us.

00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:11,549
Scott: tell us what's good about the show What's bad about the show if you like the show how you found us?

414
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,181
Scott: Anything, you know, we need stuff if we get enough, right?

415
00:31:15,562 --> 00:31:16,868
Rym: It's just an echo chamber right now.

416
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:17,390
Rym: We got nothing.

417
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:22,290
Scott: Yeah, if we get enough feedback, we can probably turn Monday into a feedback show.

418
00:31:22,852 --> 00:31:23,875
Rym: Yeah, you know.

419
00:31:23,975 --> 00:31:31,082
Rym: or if you have an idea for a thing to do on Mondays that isn't sci-tech because we've tried that it's hard To do, you know if we get people you can make Monday the request.

420
00:31:31,163 --> 00:31:32,689
Scott: show like hey guys talk about this.

421
00:31:33,316 --> 00:31:34,168
Scott: Then we talk about it.

422
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:38,225
Rym: We thought about doing old-school nights, but that doesn't work because we just do that.

423
00:31:38,245 --> 00:31:39,690
Rym: whenever we talk about anime and video games.

424
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:41,659
Scott: Anyway, yeah be like, hey, let's talk about old-school.

425
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,783
Scott: All right, what are we gonna talk about?

426
00:31:42,924 --> 00:31:44,149
Scott: old-school video games?

427
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:46,559
