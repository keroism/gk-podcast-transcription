00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,100
Scott: I was home cuz you don't go my room and you saw my car outside, right?

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,566
Rym: Well, I walked out and your car was there and for a second I thought did he ride his bike?

8
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:37,516
Rym: and then I realized no, he's a lazy fuck.

9
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:38,420
Rym: He won't ride his bike.

10
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:46,007
Rym: So I walk in I walk upstairs and you're in bed and I assumed you just overslept or you Didn't set an alarm or you know what happens.

13
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:02,407
Scott: Then I looked at the clock and I saw it was 2 30 and I was like my stomach hurt bad enough to wake me up.

Scott: So I went back to bed.

20
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:30,320
Rym: So well, but you think maybe it could have been the lasagna you had at the diner last night.

21
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,773
Scott: I'm betting it was but but let me finish the story here.

00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:47,460
Rym: This doesn't involve your bed.

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,030
Scott: I already said the word diarrhea doesn't get more disgusting than that.

28
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:52,680
Rym: It could be like diarrhea that doesn't go into a toilet.

29
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:54,608
Scott: No, it goes through it.

30
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:57,600

72
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:59,762
Scott: You know I tried to push a little bit and once I got some coughing and it felt like the coughing was gonna bring something out of Esophagus.

00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,372
Scott: but no, I got some mucus like a spec.

74
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:03,696

118
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,999
Rym: I had a crazy thing today, but it wasn't as crazy as everyone made it out to be.

119
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:20,200
Scott: See I didn't think it was that crazy.

120
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:21,606
Rym: Well, I wasn't sure.

121
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:23,374
Rym: cuz I was at work and I was about to leave you.

122
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:24,620
Scott: you exaggerate many things.

123
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,443
Rym: I cuz I went.

124
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:28,736
Rym: I checked the FARC before I left work just in case, you know, maybe something happened.

125
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:35,775
Rym: I always check part and FARC has a story newsflash mind you and there's not even a link associated with it.

126
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:46,840
Rym: It's such breaking news and the actual FARC headline was Democratic minority leader Harry Reid calls private closed-door session in Senate to scrutinize pre-iraq war intelligence.

127
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:52,979
Rym: And I thought Shits something's going down and actually something did go down.

128
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:55,571
Scott: But it's not crazy exciting.

129
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:56,053
Scott: It's just all.

130
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:57,097
Scott: they had a closed-door meeting.

131
00:06:57,138 --> 00:07:05,909
Rym: Whoo Well, it is fairly exciting because it's the beginning of a congressional committee to look into Certain things that happen during the Iraq war.

132
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,440
Scott: a congressional committee that will find nothing exciting.

133
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,280
Rym: No, because the kid that everyone really nor is three Democrats and three Republicans.

134
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:19,236
Scott: Yeah, okay, 9/11 Commission found all this bad stuff And meanwhile, everyone was like, oh look what they found and then that was it.

135
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:19,860
Scott: No one did anything.

136
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:21,510
Rym: Yeah, I'm trying to be optimistic here.

137
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,060
Rym: Yeah, apparently you're a pessimist.

138
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:24,903
Scott: Look who's talking.

139
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:26,248
Rym: what I was all.

140
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:30,361
Rym: I really assumed that Fitzgerald was gonna get some people and he got someone and he's still getting People.

141
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,891
Scott: yeah, we'll see they can indict people.

142
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:38,335
Scott: if you know like a witness during the trial says something You know a lot of people think that was the strategy that he got the one guy.

143
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:39,220
Rym: so we can get other people.

144
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,270
Scott: Yeah, I mean if like you kill someone Who You know was robbing your store or something, you know.

145
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:49,756
Scott: and during your testimony you say this guy was robbed my store Well, they just indict him right there.

146
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:54,450
Rym: But the FARC threat on this pretty much has turned into a flame war.

147
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:55,373
Scott: great.

148
00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:56,837
Rym: Oh, really really?

149
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,179
Scott: Yeah, really so ice hockey.

150
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,255
Rym: Yeah, I'm really liking the fact that hockey's back.

151
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:10,899
Rym: Yeah hockey Hockey is very much a geek sport in that Traditionally geeks seem to like the sport.

152
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:17,360
Rym: I mean MIT didn't have a good hockey team, but the fans were real into it and real nerdly.

153
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:22,010
Rym: RIT RIT very big geek school very big.

154
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,200
Scott: I think it's cuz all the geek schools are from the cold areas.

155
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:25,495
Scott: You don't see the geeks at like.

156
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:26,822
Rym: Wait a minute.

157
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:28,327
Rym: Wait a minute Caltech.

158
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,539
Scott: You don't see the geeks at Caltech or Georgia Tech like in the ice hockey.

159
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:34,326
Rym: Yeah, they don't have the ice.

160
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:38,724
Rym: Well, they do have the ice hockey just not so much not so good It's the cold schools.

161
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:41,533
Scott: and telling you it's a northerner thing, you know the Messier line.

162
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:41,874
Scott: Yeah.

163
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:50,093
Rym: Well also I think it is a very good game in terms of Something that you can watch and appreciate on multiple levels.

164
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:54,714
Scott: Yeah as opposed to basketball, yeah, yeah.

165
00:08:55,821 --> 00:09:03,285
Scott: Yeah, man, that sounds so racist because basketball is so black and hockey so white but it Basketball is a good sport.

166
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:06,014
Rym: The NBA is not basketball.

167
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:07,520
Rym: That is how I say it.

168
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,551
Scott: Yeah, but that still sounds racist to those people.

169
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:12,017
Rym: I like women's basketball a lot.

170
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:16,253
Scott: Yeah And that's saying it is racist because I'm totally on the side.

171
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:20,640
Scott: that it's not you know And that you know, but a lot of what I say those kind of things.

172
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:30,076
Rym: I do have to point out that my red wings are really taking advantage of these new rules and They're leading the league far and away and no one's even close to late.

173
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:30,859
Scott: a bunch of crap teams.

174
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:35,953
Scott: No, they played good teams and not so much and they're in the easier division.

175
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:41,209
Rym: Ah, actually they're in one of the hardest divisions The only other team in there it's.

176
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,624
Scott: it's so weird because all the teams that were no good are now good like the Nashville Predators like the.

177
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:48,132
Scott: they're different Nashville enough big cheerleaders that they're hockey.

178
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:48,473
Scott: That's so much.

179
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:50,700
Scott: They don't know about how they're doing good.

180
00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:54,614
Scott: And the New York Rangers haven't done good since 94 when they won.

181
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:55,718
Rym: They're not doing good at all.

182
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:56,300
Scott: They're doing great.

183
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,291
Rym: No, they're doing terribly.

184
00:09:58,391 --> 00:09:59,035
Scott: No, they're not.

185
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:02,609
Rym: I'll pull up Something else but I'll pull up the NHL standings.

186
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:03,452
Rym: we can talk about that.

187
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:06,000
Scott: All right, the Rangers are actually doing really good.

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,807
Scott: They're in first place.

189
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:08,260
Rym: Oh, no, the Red Wings are.

190
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:11,085
Scott: That's the other part of hockey.

191
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:16,399
Rym: You realize that it's divisional and it's also reads broken up in two tiers.

192
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:20,173
Scott: now It's always been broken up, but now they're doing it strictly.

193
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:21,559
Rym: There's fewer games now.

194
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:23,046
Rym: Intercross division.

195
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:26,059
Rym: That's why the Red Wings are only playing the Rangers once.

196
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:30,457
Scott: Yeah, that's why the Red Wings are playing the easy teams and the Rangers of any.

197
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,280
Rym: what other news you got?

198
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,910
Rym: I'll show you the Rangers standings.

199
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:34,620
Scott: Yeah, they're doing really well.

200
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:40,920
Scott: There was ten news stories about the revolution today and all of them were conflicting.

201
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:48,160
Scott: Aha, so it's coming out in June or October or May or April or December.

202
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:50,190
Rym: Did any of these people cite a source?

203
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:52,039
Scott: Yeah, they all cited different sources.

204
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,980
Scott: There was like one thing from Iwata and a thing from Miyamoto today, and it was all confusing and no one could be final.

205
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:03,257
Scott: So I just kind of ignored all of it and I'll read the final deal tomorrow.

206
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:05,585
Rym: Ah I'm still looking forward to it.

207
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:08,033
Scott: Yeah gonna buy it when it comes out.

208
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,100
Rym: Yeah, and I'm gonna use yours.

209
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:11,536
Rym: I'll buy a controller for it.

210
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:13,986
Scott: Better I think they're gonna be expensive.

211
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,050
Scott: They'll probably be like 40 bucks.

212
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:16,435
Rym: Yeah, that's fine.

213
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:17,960
Rym: I own my one GameCube controller.

214
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:19,889
Rym: I'm all on my one revolution controller.

215
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,120
Rym: I own my one PlayStation one DualShock controller.

216
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:23,310
Scott: I gotta get one of those.

217
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:25,263
Scott: those are hard to find Not really.

218
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:32,947
Scott: you just only looked in one store a store which had a zillion regular PlayStation one controllers But no PlayStation one DualShock controller.

219
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,234
Scott: I think PlayStation 2 controllers might work.

220
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:35,816
Scott: I just don't know.

221
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:37,220
Rym: Well, that's all you.

222
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:40,331
Scott: Yeah, so I saw you were looking at the Rangers standings.

223
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:40,712
Scott: Did you?

224
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:48,550
Rym: yeah, like the Rangers are five and five Not five five and they've lost five.

225
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,290
Scott: That's why it says New York Rangers six for I don't know that that doesn't count.

226
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:57,728
Rym: All that counts is within the division and in the division, they're five and five.

227
00:11:58,672 --> 00:11:59,575
Scott: Where does it say that?

228
00:11:59,696 --> 00:12:02,285
Scott: it says five and four and one four and one.

229
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:03,550
Rym: one is overtime loss?

230
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:05,294
Scott: It doesn't matter.

231
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:06,719
Scott: There's six and four.

232
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,446
Scott: they have 13 points.

233
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:09,590
Scott: No, they're very play.

234
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,918
Rym: No, they have 15 points even better.

235
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,563
Rym: The Red Wings have 22 points.

236
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:15,430
Scott: The Red Wings are in the other half.

237
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,760
Rym: Montreal is 17 Carolina has 17 Vancouver has.

238
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,430
Scott: those are all in the other half of hockey in the Western Conference.

239
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:24,862
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

240
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:25,710
Rym: the Western Conference?

241
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,588
Rym: Traditionally tends to win.

242
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:29,716
Scott: No, not so much.

243
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:30,239
Rym: Yeah.

244
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:32,730
Rym: Yeah, look at the last 50 years of the Stanley Cup.

245
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:35,586
Scott: I do not see a Stanley Cup in your future.

246
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:36,190
Rym: Uh, you know what?

247
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,055
Rym: I'll bet you 50 bucks.

248
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:46,563
Rym: the Red Wings win the Stanley Cup versus whatever team you sail winning and if neither one wins it Not the Red Wings so what that's a stupid fine.

249
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,028
Rym: then I get at least ten to one odds.

250
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:51,082
Scott: no Oh, so you're saying that they don't have a good chance.

251
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:53,696
Rym: No, I'm saying that I'm sure ball I'm sure they have a good chance.

252
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:57,899
Scott: if you're gonna take such a blanket blanket bet I'm just saying the Red Wings are not gonna win.

253
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,546
Rym: I think they're gonna say it's way.

254
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:06,094
Scott: early in the season They haven't played any good teams and in the playoffs when they're forced to place real teams Then they're not gonna win.

255
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:09,729
Rym: you realize they are a real good hockey team and every year they do really really well.

256
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:18,406
Rym: and You got you know, in fact, they're tied with the Jersey Devils for the best teams in the last ten years.

257
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:19,170
Scott: You're just biased.

258
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:21,624
Scott: You're not actually haven't even watched a hockey game this season.

259
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:22,650
Scott: You don't know anything about it.

260
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,325
Scott: You just look at those numbers and you're a Red Wings fan and you go woo.

261
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:25,808
Scott: They're gonna win.

262
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:26,110
Scott: Oh my god.

263
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:26,438
Scott: Oh my god.

264
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:26,808
Scott: Oh my god.

265
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:31,086
Rym: No I want to read about the games - my dad calls me after every game and tells me what happens.

266
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,190
Scott: your dad's a hockey expert.

267
00:13:32,732 --> 00:13:33,816
Rym: My dad's a hockey nut.

268
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:35,141
Scott: He's not a hockey expert.

269
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:36,647
Rym: You realize I grew up in hockey town.

270
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:37,390
Rym: I grew up in Detroit.

271
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:47,716
Rym: My family is Probably more fanatical about hockey than I am about anime board games hockey Geekery and computers combined.

272
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:51,669
Scott: we're fanatical about hockey, but I still contend you are not hockey experts.

273
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:57,209
Scott: Actually your analysis of hockey is not.

274
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,920
Rym: My analysis is based on what I hear from other people.

275
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,510
Scott: Yeah, so, you know, we'll see we'll see.

276
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,924
Rym: I think the Red Wings got a good chance.

277
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:13,890
Scott: Yeah So Sony the new Sony record company their DRM CDs are the root kit.

278
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,526
Scott: They just install a root kit on you so that you can't remove the DRM software.

279
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:23,707
Rym: Um great See I'd care but one I don't.

280
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:38,709
Rym: You know because the last CD I bought was Metallica and justice for all yep But the real issue here is that I want to while I would never buy CD you only get the root kit or use Windows.

281
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:47,209
Rym: I want to Have them go to jail for hacking, but it's not hacking because you bought the CD and it warns you that it dissolves copy protection.

282
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:56,833
Rym: Yeah, but it's kind of like and I heard but I can't verify that the CD itself doesn't actually have the CD logo that says It's a fully compliant.

283
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:57,957
Scott: Oh, none of those CDs.

284
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,604
Scott: so CD logo from Philips.

285
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:01,210
Rym: technically nothing illegal was done.

286
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,830
Scott: It doesn't say it's gonna install a root kid.

287
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:07,256
Scott: I mean if you come and I come to your house I say I'm gonna work on your computer.

288
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:11,900
Rym: basically says it's going to but it says it in legalese and it I don't think it Said you can't get them there.

289
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,050
Rym: They pretty much got it gold.

290
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,190
Rym: The only thing you can do is either not buy their product or pirate their products.

291
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,738
Scott: Yeah, but I don't think anyone's going to.

292
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,850
Scott: I think they're definitely gonna be in trouble over this and I don't think they will be.

293
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,745
Rym: Unless a third party exploits this rootkit people are gonna get them.

294
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:29,130
Scott: It's not gonna fly.

295
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:32,484
Rym: I don't think anyone cares except us and our fellow geeks.

296
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,050
Scott: No plenty of people care.

297
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:34,958
Rym: No, they don't cuz they don't even know.

298
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,849
Rym: most people have a Windows computer Don't even know that the spyware they already have is causing their problems.

299
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:44,205
Scott: Yeah, but you realize that other nerdy things are only nerds care like broadcast flag.

300
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:45,710
Scott: We beat back ferociously.

301
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:49,370
Rym: Actually, I'm very pro broadcast flag.

302
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,984
Scott: You know, you can be pro or against any of these things.

303
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:56,638
Scott: as if you're pro you say good It'll hurt everyone and then they'll wake up.

304
00:15:56,698 --> 00:15:58,364
Scott: Yes, or no?

305
00:15:58,505 --> 00:15:59,890
Scott: because then that's the right way.

306
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:08,070
Rym: I used to be very very on the side of good But now I'm on the side of evil because I want people to get their bad medicine and realize they need to change.

307
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:10,445
Scott: I don't like I'm going.

308
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:13,281
Scott: I was Just keep it the good way.

309
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:19,110
Scott: if we start letting them get the bad way We might turn out that it doesn't work and the people still don't do anything about it.

310
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,350
Scott: And then we're stuck in this crap.

311
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,031
Scott: That's fine Cuz.

312
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:21,572
Rym: that makes us.

313
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:31,347
Rym: the more people let themselves be locked down in their media their push technology The more people like us have power over those people because we exist outside of that.

314
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:33,930
Rym: Mac and I I couldn't come up with a funny word.

315
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,544
Scott: Yeah, but then it'll be easier to find out who we are and get us.

316
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:37,670
Rym: get us for what?

317
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:39,495
Scott: You know, it'll turn into a 1984.

318
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:40,759
Scott: It'll be screwed.

319
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:44,450
Rym: We're the only ones who'd be smart enough to run a 1984.

320
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,697
Scott: No, you don't have to be smart to run a 1984. the Very top half the 1984 runs itself.

321
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:50,419
Rym: I don't know.

322
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,943
Rym: Yeah, it depends on the 1984.

323
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:52,765
Rym: I mean, is it a Brazil?

324
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:52,966
Rym: Is it?

325
00:16:57,794 --> 00:16:59,945
Scott: And the people are just cogs in the machine.

326
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,010
Scott: you don't need anyone to run them.

327
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,976
Rym: Yeah But it could be.

328
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:07,784
Rym: it could be like a Harrison Berger on 1984 where there's smart people who run it because they're the only ones who know how to smile.

329
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:12,460
Rym: people are running it then it doesn't Matter because they're smart, but they're also evil or stupid.

330
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:15,609
Scott: if they're also evil then, you know, you know, they could be savants.

331
00:17:15,871 --> 00:17:20,029
Rym: They're real good at running an Aurelian society, but they're real bad at everything else.

332
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,490
Rym: hmm, so a SEO.

333
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:31,806
Rym: finally finally finally finally Actually said what they're suing IBM over specifically.

334
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:32,890
Scott: What was it?

335
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:34,897
Rym: It's sealed and only the judge could read it.

336
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:35,820
Scott: So it's made up.

337
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,650
Rym: Yeah, but they actually filed it and they said this is it?

338
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:48,993
Rym: They said there are two hundred and seventeen bits of code that they believe IBM or sequence 200 pieces Not bits.

339
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,961
Scott: You can't say bits if we're talking about code.

340
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:51,684
Rym: I can say bits.

341
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:53,350
Rym: we call all the bits on the show bits.

342
00:17:53,591 --> 00:17:54,493
Scott: Are they lines?

343
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:55,316
Scott: Are they functions?

344
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,382
Scott: Are they whole file areas?

345
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:06,862
Rym: The specific word used in the brief is areas 217 areas where they think that IBM Took their code and put it in open source code.

346
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:09,390
Rym: and they're not claiming that it was a copyright infringement.

347
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:13,463
Rym: They're only claiming that IBM violated the contract that they signed with SEO.

348
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:15,650
Rym: except IBM didn't sign that contract with SEO.

349
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:17,029
Rym: They signed that contract with.

350
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:23,069
Rym: Was it AT&T or it was a long time ago and SEO really had nothing to do with this anyway?

351
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:27,929
Rym: Aha, so it's still BS and the whole thing is just crap.

352
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:32,970
Rym: But SEO finally said what they claim IBM might have stolen.

353
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:39,980
Rym: I'm sure Grok law has the the whole stuff now because it's sealed and until Either it's unsealed or the court case concludes.

354
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:40,763
Rym: We can't read it.

355
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:41,726
Scott: It doesn't matter.

356
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:42,850
Scott: They're not going anywhere.

357
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,139
Scott: I can't believe this is still happening.

358
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,570
Scott: I haven't heard news about it for months.

359
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,881
Rym: I thought we considering that I mean I work for IBM and Most people inside IBM have never even heard of SEO.

360
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:54,129
Rym: That's how little IBM cares about this.

361
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,549
Rym: Yeah Yeah, yeah.

362
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,458
Rym: Though there there was some funny news.

363
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:02,462
Rym: This is kind of weird news.

364
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:03,225
Rym: It's not really news.

365
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,008
Rym: It's just a weird thing.

366
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:06,758
Rym: There's this time.

367
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,065
Rym: I saw it because it happened in Rochester.

368
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:08,729
Rym: we used to go to school.

369
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:22,213
Rym: there's this family and they have their garage and they moved into the house and they found a Negative like of old film like 1920s 1930s film of pictures laying on the floor in the middle of the garage whatever.

370
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:26,700
Rym: they thought that they were just Like something the previous owner left behind.

371
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:28,530
Rym: so they moved in they threw the pictures away, whatever.

372
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:32,243
Rym: See this is kind of a ghost story to go with the fact that yesterday was Halloween.

373
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:33,367
Scott: Oh great.

374
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:34,009
Scott: Don't worry.

375
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:40,090
Rym: Don't worry Because everyone involved is smart except that they're lacking one critical skill, which is problem-solving.

376
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:47,650
Rym: so a few weeks go by and One and then they go out and another negative is in the middle of their locked garage on the floor.

377
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:49,815
Rym: That's weird.

378
00:19:50,258 --> 00:19:52,653
Rym: And then another one appears the next day Mm-hmm.

379
00:19:52,934 --> 00:20:05,850
Rym: So at this point the lady who like the head of the household Thinks something's going on and you'd think most people would be like it's a ghost She was like, there's got to be some film somewhere in this garage that's fallen from somewhere.

380
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,718
Rym: So she's looking through all the rafters.

381
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:08,622
Rym: You can't find anything.

382
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:10,390
Rym: She cleans out the whole garage can't find anything.

383
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:13,141
Rym: So she calls the police like hey, this is weird.

384
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:19,408
Rym: So the police look and they noticed that they're Chew marks like squirrels or rats were chewing on the film.

385
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:22,889
Scott: So squirrels are stealing film from Kodak and putting in their house.

386
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:29,556
Rym: the best guess anyone's come up with is that there is a stash somewhere of These film.

387
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:30,704
Rym: it looks like pictures from the 1920s and 30s.

388
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:42,870
Rym: some of them are of this house and of the neighborhood somewhere in the neighborhood and Some squirrels or some rats must have gotten into it and are trying to use it for something or carrying it around And they're carrying it through this garage in their path.

389
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:47,599
Scott: Why don't they grab a squirrel put a tag on it?

390
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:50,148
Rym: because the odds of getting the right squirrel there's no way.

391
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:52,276
Rym: now This is cool.

392
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:54,130
Rym: And I really would like to know like what this is.

393
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:11,243
Rym: Maybe there's some cool pictures that we'll get out of this But it doesn't seem like anyone involved had the bright idea to I don't know put a camera in the garage and see where the film comes from or put a motion sensor or Stand there until a rat runs by carrying some film.

394
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,588
Scott: I guess they just don't care that much.

395
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:18,745
Scott: No So the last thing I got here is in the Olympics, I don't know which Olympics.

396
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:20,130
Scott: I think a winter or summer.

397
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,397
Scott: It must be a summer because it's weightlifting.

398
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:31,279
Scott: I read I didn't read all the details, but there's gonna be one team Korea whoa Not North Korea, not South Korea.

399
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,864
Scott: Just Korea.

400
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:35,293
Rym: I Guess that's a good thing.

401
00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:38,884
Scott: I guess I mean are they putting on a show?

402
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:44,357
Rym: or I mean, I'm real pro South Korea I'm real leery of North Korea.

403
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:47,769
Rym: I'd like to see them unify in some sort of good way.

404
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:50,409
Scott: Yeah, that'd be good.

405
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:54,386
Rym: Yeah, at least you know, I think as long as they don't unify like in 2009 lost memories.

406
00:21:55,711 --> 00:22:00,570
Scott: I think the real thing is is that yeah, they they want to win something.

407
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:02,152
Rym: Hmm.

408
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:05,004
Rym: Yeah, that'd be good for national pride on both ends.

409
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:16,640
Rym: Yeah So my thing of the day is awesome, all right, it's Not anything cool on the internet.

410
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,613
Rym: It's just something that happened that I found deliciously ironic Mm-hmm.

411
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:23,223
Rym: So a green piece.

412
00:22:23,244 --> 00:22:24,973
Scott: Oh Great.

413
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:38,190
Rym: Yeah, so, uh way back they got their ship the rainbow warrior and The French Secret Service blew it up Because green piece is awesome and the Secret Service decided they had to do something about them being awesome.

414
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:39,384
Rym: Great blow up their ship.

415
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:39,849
Scott: awesome.

416
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,583
Rym: They have a second ship the rainbow warrior - and they've been using it for a while.

417
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:48,229
Rym: They do stuff with it and They were out in the ocean.

418
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,289
Scott: What ocean doesn't matter.

419
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:51,766
Rym: They were out in the ocean.

420
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:57,929
Rym: There's some reefs and they pulled the boat up to these reefs to do a protest about people damaging the reefs.

421
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:03,549
Rym: They damn they screwed up and they rammed into the reef and caused a whole bunch of damage to it.

422
00:23:04,554 --> 00:23:11,302
Rym: Great, and they got fined by the Mexican government $15,000 which they can't seem to pay.

423
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:13,688
Scott: they got plenty of money from people.

424
00:23:13,748 --> 00:23:14,210
Scott: What the hell?

425
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:16,550
Rym: Yeah, I don't know the whole deal.

426
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,827
Rym: All I know is that they were you know saying they're gonna protect this reef and then they rammed their boat into it.

427
00:23:22,188 --> 00:23:28,580
Rym: They're ugly rusting leaky Environmentally on the sound giant boat full of dirty hippies.

428
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:32,170
Scott: It's because they're not actually they're people who like lichen.

429
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:33,763
Rym: Yeah, they're not environmentalists.

430
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:38,219
Rym: Of course Environmentalists are rare nowadays because a lot of people are very.

431
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:41,290
Rym: they say they're pro-environment, but they don't actually understand what?

432
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:48,946
Rym: What any of that means like they'll be anti nuclear power Oh, but then they're also anti coal power, but then they're also anti hydroelectric.

433
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:49,970
Rym: and then how the hell do you want some?

434
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,134
Rym: Do you want any electricity?

435
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:51,615
Scott: Mm-hmm?

436
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:53,402
Rym: I don't know what they want.

437
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:57,455
Scott: They wanna there you go on your power But they don't really want that.

438
00:23:57,776 --> 00:23:58,098
Rym: Yeah.

439
00:23:58,399 --> 00:23:59,683
Rym: No, I don't think they really want that.

440
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:00,205
Scott: They don't.

441
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:04,117
Rym: so, uh, yeah They just say like wanted to use a word from the vernacular.

442
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:05,080
Rym: They're shit talkers.

443
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,384
Scott: They're definitely shit talkers.

444
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,994
Scott: Oh My thing of the day is so cool.

445
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,037
Scott: is this website?

446
00:24:11,037 --> 00:24:16,158
Scott: 20 the number 20 - go to - 10. calm Uh-huh.

447
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:22,826
Scott: This guy made a website But his website looks like DOS like there's no links or anything.

448
00:24:23,006 --> 00:24:24,210
Scott: It doesn't look like a normal website.

449
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:32,226
Scott: it like comes up in a new window, it looks like a terminal and There's a C colon in it and you type commands to look at the different parts of his webpage.

450
00:24:32,828 --> 00:24:33,430
Rym: That's kind of cool.

451
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:36,081
Scott: I thought it was very very slick.

452
00:24:36,382 --> 00:24:36,985
Scott: I should make one.

453
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:37,949
Scott: That's Linux II.

454
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,032
Rym: Make one.

455
00:24:39,072 --> 00:24:40,156
Rym: that's just just make one.

456
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:43,170
Rym: That's a full Linux shell and hidden around it or thing.

457
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:47,309
Scott: Well, actually this website you can go to where it actually gives you a Linux desktop in your.

458
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:48,499
Rym: yeah You actually showed that to me.

459
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,552
Rym: Yeah You should probably pull.

460
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:55,811
Scott: actually I heard there's another company now where they'll give you a Linux desktop with storage space and you get an Account.

461
00:24:56,433 --> 00:24:58,259
Scott: so basically it's like you're buying a computer.

462
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,450
Scott: you get a free computer and you can access it from any computer.

463
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:02,715
Rym: It's kind of handy.

464
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:03,879
Rym: Yeah, kind of cool.

465
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,404
Scott: You just keep things on the desktop there and you go to another computer and up There it is.

466
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:11,821
Scott: Yeah, if only it had a static IP or whatever.

467
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:17,034
Scott: you could really do stuff, yep All right.

468
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:20,786
Rym: So we talked a long time about things that aren't video games.

469
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:21,869
Scott: with how much time?

470
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:24,039
Scott: 25 minutes, that's good.

471
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,328
Scott: We can talk about video games.

472
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:30,793
Rym: for time We were always shooting for you know, 10 minutes of news and then getting right to the bit But it'll be a short bit.

473
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:39,383
Rym: 40 40 minutes is about the time totally were shooting for because I've only been playing one game And that's Castlevania DS which I beat.

474
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:53,553
Rym: and then I realized That there are multiple endings and it's not like the old Castlevania games where there's the bad ending words in black and white And then the good ending words in color and then the really good ending were like it's in color and then a hand appears at The end.

475
00:25:53,695 --> 00:25:54,810
Scott: Yeah, that's the best ending.

476
00:25:55,752 --> 00:26:06,690
Rym: So, uh to not spoil the game there is a point at which you can kill a dude and if you kill this dude the game ends and It's the lamest ending to a video game that there has ever been.

477
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:13,710
Rym: Like I felt less satisfaction from that ending that I felt from the ending of Mario 1.

478
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,018
Rym: Congratulations, you win and then you start over.

479
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,262
Rym: less than that.

480
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:25,944
Rym: Well nothing it was horrid And it was about 10 seconds long Awesome, and then there were some credits that I just I was so far.

481
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:26,949
Rym: I just turned the game off.

482
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:27,237
Scott: well

483
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:40,264
Rym: Then I discovered that you have to do some Regame facts to figure out how to do it thing or be Perceptive and you'll figure it out and then there's a whole nother game and the game keeps going for a long time And there's more stuff to do and then you get real endings.

484
00:26:40,486 --> 00:26:41,110
Scott: That's just evil.

485
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,546
Scott: Yeah, because I would have stopped playing at the first ending.

486
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:45,190
Scott: It's been pissed.

487
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:52,138
Rym: I would have accepted if you're smart, you'll get the first ending and then you'll realize wait a minute What was that thing?

488
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:53,870
Rym: I wonder if I could have done a thing to it.

489
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:02,250
Rym: Mmm, the only reason that's a game facts thing is because if you don't have the thing to do the thing And you don't know where to get the thing that'll let you do the thing.

490
00:27:02,631 --> 00:27:08,209
Rym: You'll think there's a thing I can do something to it and you won't know how and you won't be able to do it.

491
00:27:08,992 --> 00:27:10,017
Scott: I hate games like that.

492
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:11,221
Rym: Yeah, that was prize.

493
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:13,330
Scott: I wonder if the Gameboy ones were like that also.

494
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,728
Rym: Well, they all have the same main character and they're basically the same plot thread.

495
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:20,461
Rym: apparently Mmm, and they're apparently rare and hard to find.

496
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:22,387
Scott: really I know people have them.

497
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:23,350
Rym: Oh, yeah a lot of people have them.

498
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:29,150
Rym: They're not super rare, but they didn't print or they didn't make so many of the Gameboy Castlevania cartridges.

499
00:27:29,874 --> 00:27:31,281
Scott: The first one I know is common.

500
00:27:31,302 --> 00:27:36,726
Rym: I don't know about the second one though Like they're not rare rare rare, but you won't find them for less than 20 bucks even.

501
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:37,349
Scott: Oh, okay.

502
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,737
Scott: Yeah Boxes don't have a good game.

503
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:43,770
Scott: You can't even get like Mario Kart Gameboy Advance for cheap.

504
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:46,438
Scott: Yeah, cuz it's you know, it's it's a good game.

505
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,164
Scott: only the bad games are cheap.

506
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:50,030
Rym: So how's a Phoenix Wright coming?

507
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,233
Scott: I beat Phoenix, right?

508
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,357
Rym: Yeah, is it good?

509
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:53,401
Scott: He was excellent.

510
00:27:54,144 --> 00:27:57,709
Scott: It's like Carmen San Diego, but better awesomer.

511
00:27:58,751 --> 00:28:02,329
Scott: Apparently there are three Gameboy Advance games of Phoenix Wright in Japan.

512
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:03,292
Rym: Aha,

513
00:28:03,553 --> 00:28:13,628
Scott: and this game for the DS is actually just a copy of the first GBA game and you can tell because the first four Episodes don't really involve the DS at all

514
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:14,412
Rym: Uh-huh,

515
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:21,097
Scott: and then the fifth extra episode is a special DS episode and it's come, you know It's got different characters and everything.

516
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,830
Rym: Ooh, so I imagine that we'll get more of these games.

517
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:29,710
Scott: The fifth episode is also the longest and I would say possibly In terms of plot, I don't think it's the best episode.

518
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:39,020
Scott: I think the fourth one would be the best in terms of plot Uh-huh, and the third would be the funniest but the fifth one was definitely the highest quality game There it get a lot of parts.

519
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,805
Scott: He just didn't know what to do.

520
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:40,410
Scott: I was stumped.

521
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:46,450
Scott: I had to try crazy things and there's a lot more evidence tons of evidence a lot more investigating interacting with the evidence.

522
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,058
Scott: You know, you know the evidence is like 3d.

523
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:53,327
Scott: you could rotate it and stuff and it's pretty cool Pretty cool.

524
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,930
Scott: But the ending is also kind of bleh.

525
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:57,693
Scott: And there's two.

526
00:28:57,793 --> 00:29:07,863
Scott: this at the end of episode four after you beat it because it's like the game they don't need a big ending Because you know the game itself the plot of itself is.

527
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:12,550
Scott: it stands good, you know You don't need a big thing at the after the plot is over to do stuff.

528
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:18,514
Scott: But the end of episode four someone says, you know show this show the evidence that something something You know.

529
00:29:18,534 --> 00:29:22,749
Scott: and you have to pick the really one chance and I picked the wrong one.

530
00:29:23,232 --> 00:29:23,896
Scott: Episode five.

531
00:29:23,937 --> 00:29:25,909
Scott: they do it again, but it's different and I picked the wrong one.

532
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:32,392
Scott: yeah, but apparently that only gets you like an extra sentence of content a Whole sentence.

533
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:34,539
Scott: Yeah, or two sentences.

534
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:36,846
Scott: It only gets you a tiny bit of content if you pick right.

535
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:38,310
Rym: see that's where Castlevania goes.

536
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:40,062
Rym: If you pick right you get a 20% bonus game.

537
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:42,520
Rym: It just keeps going and there's more.

538
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,750
Rym: get more stuff and more bosses.

539
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:45,179
Scott: Yeah, this you pick right.

540
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,589
Scott: it just changes the ending a tiny bit.

541
00:29:47,914 --> 00:29:52,270
Scott: And I'd say the ending after episode four is a lot better than the ending of episode five.

542
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:53,619
Rym: Still a good game.

543
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:54,525
Scott: Very good game.

544
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:55,149
Scott: Everyone should get it.

545
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,679
Scott: I'm probably gonna get all of them if they come out with more.

546
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,262
Rym: once I finish Castlevania and kill Dracula again, I'll Trade up with you.

547
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:06,906
Scott: Yep Trauma Center, I actually I beat that hard hard hard mission.

548
00:30:06,926 --> 00:30:08,473
Rym: haven't beat the game though Have you know?

549
00:30:08,614 --> 00:30:11,050
Scott: and then there was a harder mission and then a harder mission and a harder mission.

550
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,839
Scott: I just brute-forced my way, but I'm not a mission again.

551
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:14,461
Scott: That's too hard.

552
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:15,223
Scott: Uh-huh.

553
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:17,310
Scott: I can't play it on the train cuz it shakes.

554
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:20,943
Scott: So much of the thought of that when they made the DS.

555
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:22,010
Scott: you can't play it on anything.

556
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:22,553
Scott: You can't play it.

557
00:30:22,593 --> 00:30:28,458
Scott: a car if you need precision for a game like Trauma Center with the stylus Can't play it in a car can't play it in train.

558
00:30:28,518 --> 00:30:31,890
Scott: Maybe a plane with no turbulence, but if it shakes you can't play.

559
00:30:32,991 --> 00:30:36,570
Rym: Yeah, I don't think they were thinking specifically of your commute when they made that game.

560
00:30:36,871 --> 00:30:41,410
Scott: But I mean they had there's a picture on the Nintendo DS website of a kid in the subway playing.

561
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:43,801
Rym: Yeah, cuz you can play every other game that way.

562
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:45,510
Scott: Yeah, you can play a lot of games that way.

563
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,573
Scott: You play Phoenix Wright easily.

564
00:30:47,593 --> 00:30:49,395
Scott: Yeah, just not trauma center.

565
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:59,215
Rym: So we picked up siphon filter and Gran Turismo 2 for our modded ps1.

566
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:08,223
Scott: that until now Fine it's Japanese there you go, but we can play English Huh?

567
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:12,140
Rym: I wonder why it has only ever played dance dance revolution.

568
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:18,009
Scott: So when we went to the GameStop and we saw the ps1 games like two bucks We figured might as well play those games.

569
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:18,833
Scott: You never played right?

570
00:31:19,054 --> 00:31:19,255
Scott: Yeah.

571
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,279
Rym: Yep, and I learned that.

572
00:31:20,721 --> 00:31:24,640
Rym: Well, I guess I remembered that the PlayStation one is graphics are kind of crappy.

573
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:27,571
Scott: If you play it with an emulator, they can improve.

574
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:28,696
Scott: it improves the or not.

575
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:29,339
Rym: We're playing it.

576
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,791
Scott: I don't play a ps1 game and a ps2.

577
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:32,916
Scott: Does it improve the graphics?

578
00:31:33,117 --> 00:31:35,165
Scott: I don't think so I heard maybe it did.

579
00:31:35,225 --> 00:31:35,747
Scott: maybe didn't.

580
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:39,220
Scott: maybe that's one of those things that Sony lied about and then changed up.

581
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,998
Scott: You know, yeah, I never heard anything about it.

582
00:31:42,078 --> 00:31:47,591
Rym: So Yeah, yeah.

583
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:51,204
Scott: Yeah So siphon filter.

584
00:31:51,304 --> 00:31:58,206
Scott: actually I play the game and I could tell it's a good game, but it makes you really Realize how far games have come.

585
00:31:58,226 --> 00:32:04,004
Scott: Yeah, the control of the game is is painful Like to switch weapons.

586
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:06,631
Scott: you hold select and you do LR and l2.

587
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,519
Scott: Ah, or you can just push select to cycle through.

588
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:11,602
Rym: See that's.

589
00:32:11,622 --> 00:32:23,080
Rym: the one thing I really like about the GameCube is that it's so much more intuitive that kind of control I mean all PlayStation games because there's so many buttons and they're not a B X Y or one two, three, four five.

590
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,589
Rym: They're shape shape shape shape.

591
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,080
Scott: I guess we get used to the shape shape shape shape.

592
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:32,719
Rym: Yeah, but it's also hard that Japanese games and English games reverse the function of X and O.

593
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:37,060
Scott: I think in Gran Turismo 2 X and O do the same thing and square is go back.

594
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:38,626
Rym: Yeah, see that's the thing.

595
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:42,020
Rym: There's no consistency and every Nintendo game ever a is select and B is go back.

596
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:44,099
Scott: Yeah, that's the way it is.

597
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:48,620
Rym: Plus I learned that I can't play driving games without a wheel.

598
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:50,203
Scott: You just suck.

599
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,210
Scott: I played it just fine cuz I don't like.

600
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,193
Rym: driving is not the wheel.

601
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:53,795
Rym: It doesn't seem.

602
00:32:53,836 --> 00:32:58,810
Rym: it's not a driving game anymore it's a Manipulate the analog stick precisely game.

603
00:32:59,473 --> 00:33:01,060
Scott: Yeah, what do you think with the wheel?

604
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,669
Scott: It's the same thing only instead of a stick.

605
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,373
Scott: You've got a wheel.

606
00:33:03,594 --> 00:33:04,720
Rym: Yeah, which makes it driving.

607
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:07,832
Scott: No, one of those bugs you said only shows up in my room is in your room.

608
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:09,037
Rym: Yeah, there's more of them.

609
00:33:09,077 --> 00:33:09,900
Rym: your room total.

610
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:11,968
Scott: Yeah, well there aren't.

611
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:18,516
Rym: haven't been any my room for weeks so I'll put it in your room then that'll even things out.

612
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:21,251
Scott: That's no good That's definitely not good.

613
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:21,534
Scott: Yeah.

614
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,738
Scott: So, uh, what are the games?

615
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:26,866
Rym: So you ever been playing so many games?

616
00:33:26,886 --> 00:33:29,055
Rym: we're busy doing you know life.

617
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:31,544
Scott: I'm playing plenty of games Just playing the same games a lot.

618
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:35,736
Rym: Yeah, I mean I started playing cuz I. actually it's my secret shame.

619
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:43,980
Rym: I never played Ocarina of Time, yeah, so I'm playing through it now, but I haven't played it in like two weeks because I've been busy.

620
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:53,829
Scott: Yeah, I'm playing Resident Evil 1 But I haven't played that in a while cuz it DS games kind of got me and as soon as Mario Kart comes out every Other game is just gonna be like play me play me play me.

621
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,736
Scott: Sorry Mario Kart is here.

622
00:33:55,756 --> 00:33:59,613
Scott: I Played my GBA Mario Kart to rebuild my skills.

623
00:33:59,634 --> 00:34:01,402
Scott: I Still got it.

624
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:06,179
Rym: I imagine the game will be different enough to where your skills won't carry over so much.

625
00:34:07,423 --> 00:34:07,904
Scott: I played it.

626
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,752
Scott: I played Mario Kart DS at the digital life show.

627
00:34:10,871 --> 00:34:13,860
Scott: Yeah, and my skills carry over quite well, you're all in trouble.

628
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,442
Scott: We'll see.

629
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:16,049
Scott: We'll see it.

630
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:24,545
Scott: The one thing I don't know is that in Mario Kart gameboy Super Circuit if you're racing is perfect Items can't bother you.

631
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:29,780
Scott: even the spike shell will just go right behind you and if you don't slow down you stay at top speed.

632
00:34:30,224 --> 00:34:31,498
Scott: The spike shell will not get you.

633
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,366
Scott: I don't know if that's the case.

634
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:37,141
Scott: in Mario Kart DS the spike shell might get you no matter what because that's the way it Is.

635
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:39,458
Scott: that's a in n64 and double dash?

636
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,473
Scott: The the items and luck matter a lot more than rich pure racing.

637
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:46,300
Rym: Honestly, I didn't like double dash.

638
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:53,478
Rym: I didn't like it so much like the two-player - I mean I'm not one to call things Nintendo does gimmicky because I like most of the things they do.

639
00:34:54,161 --> 00:35:04,199
Rym: but the two guys in one car thing was real gimmicky because it always ended up just being the one guy who's good drives and The friend who's not so good at the game just sits there with the items and goes L R L R L R L R.

640
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:10,380
Scott: Well, the thing is is that you were supposed it was up to the other person to give you this boost by shifting the weight.

641
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:12,590
Rym: Yeah, but that is no.

642
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,640
Rym: that was pretty much just brain dead.

643
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,784
Rym: And if you couldn't it was such a basic thing to do properly that you could play the game where you just controlled You know everything.

644
00:35:20,845 --> 00:35:24,240
Scott: but then switching the drivers was kind of yeah.

645
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:26,830
Scott: I do like the the not having.

646
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:28,456
Scott: you can actually change carts.

647
00:35:28,516 --> 00:35:32,456
Scott: like there's different carts And the DS one has that where you pick a person you pick a cart.

648
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:33,099
Rym: Oh, I like that.

649
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:42,300
Scott: Yeah, at least that's what it looked like to me You know, but yeah, it's good cuz I'll pick Luigi and I'll pick the standard Luigi cart and I'll rock everybody.

650
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:43,382
Rym: Cuz.

651
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:47,295
Rym: no game has ever really surpassed that wonderful level of ice hockey.

652
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:54,276
Scott: for the original NES I will a smash and if I a smash enough you will be put in the penalty box and not me.

653
00:35:54,837 --> 00:35:58,831
Rym: that game is Probably one of my favorite multiplayer games ever.

654
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:01,540
Scott: do they need to make an online version of ice hockey?

655
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,743
Rym: Ah, we could make it.

656
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:05,574
Scott: we could actually I guess if you use emulators.

657
00:36:05,615 --> 00:36:09,128
Scott: they play over on the internet But kind of piss poorly that's cuz.

658
00:36:09,148 --> 00:36:18,539
Scott: what they do is instead of having like a ROM and synchronizing it What they do is they just send the controls that you push over the network Yep, and you each run your own local copy of the ROM.

659
00:36:18,941 --> 00:36:23,033
Rym: So if anything gets out of whack the whole thing is just crazy and broken and you're done.

660
00:36:23,354 --> 00:36:27,511
Scott: Yep, and they don't use the PIP and they don't you know?

661
00:36:27,692 --> 00:36:34,919
Rym: set the timings perfectly Yeah, and normally when we talk about a game that we play multiplayer Both of us will contend that we're the best ever.

662
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:36,546
Rym: Some sort of argument.

663
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:37,410
Rym: but at ice hockey.

664
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:41,365
Rym: We've pretty much fought each other to a dead Stalemate on the best ever.

665
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:42,550
Scott: haven't lost a long time.

666
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:45,060
Rym: We haven't played in a long time and I won the last time.

667
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,008
Scott: We didn't win last time.

668
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:46,734
Rym: I was definitely.

669
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,095
Scott: no you didn't Not at all.

670
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:51,285
Rym: I'll throw some witnesses.

671
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:57,270
Rym: next time we play we'll have to have some certified witnesses sitting there Start keeping score and like a website.

672
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:02,032
Rym: I mean, yeah, we should plus you can't deny Uh air hockey at the shore.

673
00:37:02,113 --> 00:37:02,898
Scott: Hey air hockey.

674
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,397
Scott: I pooned um.

675
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:11,000
Rym: Do I need to remind you how many games I won how many games you won during the week at wild?

676
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:17,610
Scott: Yeah, I won and then you waited until I was tired from you But okay And then you wanted to play some more and then we played.

677
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:23,635
Scott: uh, and then whenever I wanted to play cuz I was ready To win you were like no and then you played later when you were ready to.

678
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:25,462
Rym: not only is that not true That's true.

679
00:37:25,503 --> 00:37:26,185
Rym: I got witnesses.

680
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:28,553
Rym: Yeah, I got Greg or not?

681
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,235
Rym: Greg God.

682
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:30,840
Rym: I haven't Greg's dead as far as I'm concerned.

683
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:31,426
Rym: I got Pete.

684
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:32,799
Scott: Yeah the sign it said he wasn't dead.

685
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:36,113
Rym: Yeah, but I haven't seen him or talked to him and I've messaged him a couple times.

686
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:36,977
Rym: He never answers me.

687
00:37:36,997 --> 00:37:41,033
Scott: Mm-hmm Maybe he's pretended to be dead like a possum.

688
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:43,242
Rym: Ah But I got Pete.

689
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:44,684
Rym: I got a katsu.

690
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:45,946
Rym: I got some Alex.

691
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:55,639
Scott: I Changed his mind.

692
00:37:56,902 --> 00:37:59,059
Rym: See he wouldn't take a bribe for something like that.

693
00:37:59,321 --> 00:37:59,802
Scott: Yeah, he would.

694
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:01,127
Rym: no not for something like that.

695
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,054
Rym: cuz he'd say first he'd take the bribe.

696
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:08,500
Rym: then when someone asked him He'd say yeah Scott totally bribed me to say that he was the best.

697
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,878
Scott: So yeah, so then why would he lie and say you wanted air hockey unless you bribed him?

698
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,118
Rym: Cuz I do win at air hockey.

699
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:20,060
Scott: He or you just bribed Scott Johnson to say so and then say something like that and then you can't bribe Scott Johnson.

700
00:38:20,522 --> 00:38:21,408
Rym: He's like a rock.

701
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:27,420
Rym: That's what someone who bribes him says All right, what about Pete and Alex and Don?

702
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,327
Scott: Ton wasn't paying attention as far as I know.

703
00:38:30,448 --> 00:38:31,331
Rym: No Don was there.

704
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:38,493
Scott: I don't think she was noticing our air hockey scores Only I was uh-huh.

705
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:43,094
Scott: Yeah, anyway, I think we're done.

706
00:38:43,898 --> 00:38:47,349
Rym: Yeah So, uh, we were thinking of adding a bit to the show.

707
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,116
Scott: Oh, oh we tell a story.

708
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:50,140
Rym: where we tell a story?

709
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:59,260
Rym: Because we realized that in all the years in college We told a lot of funny stories and all of us had a bunch of good stories and some of them were uproariously hilarious.

710
00:39:00,181 --> 00:39:04,213
Rym: Well, we can only ever tell him once unless we were made new friends.

711
00:39:04,454 --> 00:39:16,799
Rym: Yeah, and whenever a new friend joined the group we told all the stories again immediately and Now we got a whole bunch of new friends or at least people people podcast listen, yeah.

712
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:20,370
Rym: So, uh, we're thinking and we might start telling some stories.

713
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:21,895
Scott: tell my what.

714
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:23,279
Scott: how much minutes did we go so far?

715
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,506
Rym: Ah, it's been 40 minutes.

716
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:28,720
Rym: So if we tell a story to be a quick one, he already told your diarrhea story.

717
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:29,924
Scott: Does that count?

718
00:39:29,964 --> 00:39:34,380
Rym: that was that was a story you used up all of our leader time to tell us about how you?

719
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,044
Rym: Had diarrhea this morning.

720
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:37,829
Rym: I'm sure everyone's gonna love that.

721
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:39,835
Scott: Hey, it could be a worse story.

722
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:39,895
Scott: Mr.

723
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:40,196
Scott: 30 bargles.

724
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:42,283
Rym: Yeah Yeah, all right.

725
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:43,268
Rym: All right, that's our story.

726
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:46,202
Scott: then since this is the uh, tell the story tomorrow Often.

727
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,749
Rym: oh you got a star so I'll get a story.

728
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,496
Rym: This will be our daily SIG.

729
00:39:49,536 --> 00:39:50,420
Rym: It'll be a long say.

730
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,469
Rym: It'll be a story unless you have a better SIG.

731
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:53,392
Scott: No, we're good.

732
00:39:54,156 --> 00:39:56,198
Rym: So, uh Got some food poisoning.

733
00:39:57,801 --> 00:39:58,886
Rym: I'm not really sure what it was.

734
00:39:58,906 --> 00:40:06,860
Rym: They gave me the food poisoning, but something gave me the food poisoning and I believe you were awake into the sound of me vomiting 30 times in one night.

735
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,724
Scott: Definitely vomiting very loud.

736
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:11,108
Scott: It definitely keeping me awake.

737
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,853
Rym: It was awesome.

738
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:19,454
Rym: I Wake up and vomit and then I diarrhea and then I'd lay in my bed.

739
00:40:19,494 --> 00:40:31,463
Scott: then I'd wake up then I'd vomit diarrhea lay in My bed now, I wasn't the one vomiting but I was very unhappy from Waking up so many times and hearing the bargaining and your bedroom is fairly far away from the base very far away You were.

740
00:40:31,484 --> 00:40:37,010
Rym: you're bargaining very loud But was very loud because after a while There was nothing left to borrow the one.

741
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:41,560
Scott: the only good thing that came out of this for me was Knowing that Rym was in pain of bargaining.

742
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:48,776
Rym: Yeah We'll see what happens when I give you some more Yankee Clipper lasagna, you know what I'm not.

743
00:40:49,077 --> 00:40:51,686
Scott: the Yankee Clipper is great But I'm not eating lasagna there anymore.

744
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:55,480
Rym: Yeah, cuz I had diarrhea the last time I ate their lasagna.

745
00:40:55,681 --> 00:40:59,357
Scott: In fact, why don't we just go to the Yankee Clipper for breakfast only and go to the 84 for dinner?

746
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,188
Scott: That sounds like a plan cuz they have those nice potato skins.

747
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:06,880
Rym: Yeah, but honestly, I do like the Yankee Clippers breakfast better.

748
00:41:07,363 --> 00:41:07,967
Scott: I do like their.

749
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:08,370
Scott: they have the.

750
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:09,700
Scott: they have the banana waffle.

751
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:18,265
Rym: The only thing they don't have is my favorite meal the Belgian waffle with every kind of breakfast meat That might make you bargo Every time I've gone.

752
00:41:18,306 --> 00:41:19,711
Scott: how many times did you bargo that night?

753
00:41:20,012 --> 00:41:22,181
Rym: Oh, oh, it was like 19 or 20.

754
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:24,933
Rym: It wasn't actually 30, but it was like 19 or 20 awesome.

755
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:28,126
Rym: It was the second worst I've ever been sick to my stomach.

756
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:29,652
Scott: Oh, you could tell the first words tomorrow.

757
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:41,870
Rym: Yeah, we'll tell that story another day All right, and that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

758
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,270
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the music and promotional consideration was provided by no one.
