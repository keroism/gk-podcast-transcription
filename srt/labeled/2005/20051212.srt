1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,280
Scott: It's Monday December 12th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,978
Scott: We talked about how to purchase a computer without getting ripped off or buying more than you need.

3
00:00:18,988 --> 00:00:19,738
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:23,172
Rym: So I heard something happened to you on the way to work on the train.

5
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:25,039
Scott: a train hit a deer.

6
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:27,531
Rym: Who won train?

7
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:30,783
Scott: yeah, I figured deer didn't You know?

8
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:31,425
Scott: entirely?

9
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:32,949
Scott: lose though the train broke.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,640
Scott: like they were like yeah, the air is leaking out of the brake pipe.

11
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:41,060
Scott: Yeah, so we're gonna stop the train like three times.

12
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:44,364
Scott: I could have gotten off at 1/25th But I didn't know.

13
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:44,926
Scott: it was broken.

14
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:47,637
Scott: and then we went in the tunnel and then the train stopped.

15
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:51,399
Scott: great you can't get off in the tunnel cuz you'll uh die.

16
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:55,713
Scott: and Then we waited in there, and I was like a half hour 15 minutes.

17
00:00:56,054 --> 00:00:56,516
Scott: I was late.

18
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:57,280
Scott: It sucked.

19
00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:58,938
Scott: I sat on the train with these annoying people.

20
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:05,349
Rym: Too bad you could have just taken the four or five six At least for the first time in about a month.

21
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:07,560
Rym: I am well rested and ready to go.

22
00:01:08,363 --> 00:01:12,078
Scott: I was also very well rested today, and you don't know it's a Monday which means I had to go to work.

23
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:12,700
Scott: work was quick.

24
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,439
Scott: It's yeah, my knees are great, and I left.

25
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:18,860
Rym: I was sitting down in this a data center doing work and suddenly I look up and it's like four o'clock.

26
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:20,789
Scott: I think it's partially because on Monday.

27
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:28,100
Scott: There's a whole lot of brand new podcast episodes Yeah, also a whole bunch of webcomics whole bunch of webcomics internet news and everything.

28
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:40,065
Rym: plus while we had a crazy geek end and we played a bunch of board games which we'll get to tomorrow and Did bunch of stuff we actually got to sleep early Sleep because there's people left early.

29
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:41,269
Rym: Yeah, everyone left early.

30
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,633
Rym: You know honestly.

31
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:45,000
Scott: I would have rather had them stay to play more games.

32
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:49,606
Rym: Yeah, I wanted to play another round of a verator Verators freaking awesome.

33
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:50,470
Scott: It's awesome.

34
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:55,830
Rym: Yeah, all right, though There's some pretty big news at least for anime fans.

35
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:58,680
Rym: media play is going out of business.

36
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,311
Scott: Yeah, that means I can go get a clearance sale.

37
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:01,492
Rym: Yeah.

38
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:03,460
Rym: Yeah, we're totally looting the nearest media play.

39
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:05,368
Scott: Thank God there is one nearby which

40
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:10,910
Rym: I guess we should have seen it coming because I mean when we lived in Rochester media play was like huge and that's where all the anime was and

41
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,443
Scott: it was great because it was the closest thing to the Yeah,

42
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:18,275
Rym: that media play realized this and catered to it.

43
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:19,119
Rym: mm-hmm.

44
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,760
Rym: now We moved here, and you know years later and our media play here is really kind of shitty.

45
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,409
Scott: Yeah, the media play here is definitely like a crap hole.

46
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:27,292
Scott: No one goes there.

47
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:28,175
Rym: It was sparse.

48
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:29,480
Scott: It's in the low-rent mall.

49
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:32,267
Rym: Yeah, they never had things on time.

50
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:33,831
Rym: Yeah had the same.

51
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:36,076
Rym: does nobody sitting there on display.

52
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:37,159
Scott: There was nobody in it?

53
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,828
Scott: Yeah, definitely not the peak of media play.

54
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:44,216
Rym: well apparently the anime and manga is really the only thing.

55
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:45,700
Rym: profit media play up at all.

56
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,180
Scott: Well, they they always kept so many CDs in that store.

57
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,180
Scott: I was like why did he won't have a CD section?

58
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,934
Rym: I don't know why the people who own media play who started that company back in 1995 or 96 wasn't that long ago?

59
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:02,031
Rym: They were primarily record sellers and CD sellers.

60
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:06,129
Rym: good job and their business model actually was CD store.

61
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,440
Rym: that also sells other media.

62
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,203
Scott: That's a great idea.

63
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,727
Scott: It should have been other media store.

64
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:11,710
Rym: Well that worked real.

65
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,071
Rym: Well.

66
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:17,801
Rym: You know for about a year, then you know Napster Mp3s.

67
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:20,900
Scott: it's just hard to compete for them with these other stores.

68
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,060
Rym: Well, they can't compete with bookstores because bookstores have all the books, and they don't have so many.

69
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:25,803
Scott: That's a problem.

70
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:34,148
Scott: media play should just gotten rid of its book section because it was really never really worth anything and They should have just be gone all out with the DVDs.

71
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,680
Scott: cuz like Walmart and Best Buy sell the most DVDs and stuff.

72
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,939
Scott: But media play you know really had the good DVD section because they had the box sets.

73
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:59,893
Scott: yeah But they spent all their money like they had a video game section that wasn't as good a GameStop a book section That wasn't as good as borders You know a CD section that was Right, but they had the best DVD section better than any other store.

74
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:01,880
Scott: They should have just turned into a DVD store.

75
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:06,960
Scott: I think their problem though was that their stores are real big too big to be just a DVD store.

76
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:12,320
Rym: Yeah, cuz even the small media play cuz you know every box store like that is different sizes was real big.

77
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,987
Rym: Yeah, not like FYE.

78
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:16,437
Rym: They have like one version was real tiny and fits in them all.

79
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,608
Scott: yep That's the problem with being in a diverse Products.

80
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,890
Scott: is that you know you Have so much like space and other things.

81
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:28,480
Scott: you can't really give up or on too many of them.

82
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,560
Scott: If you know if one of them fails, that's alright, but if all of them fail, but one you're screwed.

83
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:37,739
Rym: Yeah, though I hear FYE isn't doing so well either.

84
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:40,593
Scott: Yeah, FYE cuz that's the same kind of thing.

85
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:41,678
Scott: is they diversify?

86
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,920
Scott: yeah They do sell mostly CDs at FYE.

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,995
Rym: Well actually the FYE back when I lived in Michigan that opened up it.

88
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:48,959
Rym: I had an arcade in it.

89
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,345
Scott: Yeah, so did mine in my mall.

90
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,073
Rym: Yeah, and then the arcade disappeared.

91
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:53,580
Scott: No we still have the arcade in ours.

92
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,260
Scott: I think it's the only arcade for many many miles.

93
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:06,839
Scott: But they see the store is mostly a music store although the DVD section Expanded a whole lot and the video game section kind of shrunk it back there.

94
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:16,679
Scott: but that video game section is actually useful because it's like the last place people look in the mall to buy video games and They always carry games that like you're kind of a little bit off.

95
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:19,268
Scott: So when you can't get a game they always have it.

96
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:22,119
Scott: so I'll go out there, so they're still still making money.

97
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,680
Rym: Well, I wonder if this is gonna affect the anime DVD trade at least for a little while.

98
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:31,160
Rym: I mean media play in a lot of areas is the major seller of anime related goods.

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,145
Scott: yeah, that's cuz.

100
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:45,100
Scott: they have the nice anime section, but I don't know Best Buy does have the anime DVDs and Yeah, but I mean really they're overpriced, and they don't have the new anime.

101
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:48,112
Scott: They do have the new anime actually not the day it comes out.

102
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:48,975
Rym: They're always been.

103
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,364
Scott: not the day it comes out I don't know.

104
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,637
Scott: I wonder what the anime companies think of media play like.

105
00:05:54,677 --> 00:06:00,618
Scott: what a cuz they know Like they're usually into like the Suncoast type of thing like the Suncoast always has the anime.

106
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:01,200
Scott: That's the place.

107
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:02,042
Scott: Yeah You know.

108
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:04,910
Scott: but Suncoast is media play is all of.

109
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,234
Scott: is it just media player?

110
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:08,120
Scott: all the media play related stores.

111
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:08,603
Rym: Cuz.

112
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:14,660
Rym: I know that back in the day when I still ran the RIT anime club We started working with the media play, and they were all about that.

113
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,600
Rym: They'd give us just hundreds of dollars of free stuff to give away to draw people into the store to buy anime.

114
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:24,180
Scott: Yeah, I think that media play is actually profitable and that like they should just close the other ones and leave that one open.

115
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,823
Rym: Yeah, they should.

116
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,200
Rym: but I heard from actually got some friends who run a hammer girls.

117
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,420
Rym: It's anime store right there in Rochester like across the street from media play.

118
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:37,792
Rym: They're gonna go loop media play for all its stuff when they go liquidating in January Yeah, and then sell it in their own store.

119
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:38,960
Rym: Yeah, which is gonna work for them.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,971
Rym: They're pretty much gonna have a monopoly on everything except manga.

121
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:43,577
Rym: That's related to anime now.

122
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:48,070
Rym: Yep Because Walden books honestly is making a killing on manga.

123
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:50,900
Scott: Yeah, it's the anime store here doesn't sell.

124
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:53,973
Rym: No, they sell like dealer room stuff here.

125
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:56,102
Scott: Yeah, it's like going to a dealer's room It's not?

126
00:06:56,304 --> 00:06:57,792
Scott: you know, you can't get the pro stuff.

127
00:06:58,114 --> 00:06:58,898
Scott: There's really isn't.

128
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:08,459
Scott: now I don't think there's gonna be a reliable place to buy all the pro things in our town anymore And I haven't gone without that for a long time.

129
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:13,140
Rym: Yeah, but the more I think about it one a lot of shows I really like but I don't want to buy.

130
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:14,650
Rym: But I want to see him.

131
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:20,400
Rym: and now that we have Netflix I mean Netflix killed a lot of it, but I also shows we're not gonna buy now.

132
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,573
Scott: But expect Amazon to start selling a lot more anime DVDs.

133
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,640
Rym: Yep, or actually buying direct from a TV.

134
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:29,791
Scott: They have some damn good sales every now and then that's only their old stuff.

135
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:30,394
Scott: on clearance.

136
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:33,827
Rym: Yeah, but if you want to do stuff clearance That's the Scott Johnson strategy.

137
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,153
Scott: Yeah, but you better off.

138
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,438
Scott: you get a better deal at the con.

139
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,555
Scott: sometimes It Depends but you don't buy anything from a TV or rights.

140
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:43,820
Scott: don't buy right stuff ever.

141
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:48,377
Scott: Yeah, right stuff is like they have everything there is so there's nowhere else to get it.

142
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:49,260
Scott: get it from right stuff.

143
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,300
Scott: But they sell everything at like the real price except if it's like a cold day in hell.

144
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:57,639
Scott: Yeah, they'll change the price or sell something on sale.

145
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:03,252
Rym: so I got to say you're not gonna hear much about this until January when they actually close and I imagine we're gonna have a.

146
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:10,880
Scott: Yeah, I'll have to go see try to get the best deal, you know, maybe I'll pick up.

147
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:15,259
Scott: I know they have good stuff there and I'm pretty confident that no one in this town is gonna pick it up.

148
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:18,711
Scott: So I'm gonna go get like, you know, all those box sets.

149
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:21,220
Scott: I wanted like pick up all the FMAs they've got.

150
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:22,447
Rym: Yeah, I'll get all the gakutsu.

151
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,440
Scott: Oh, they get like the Azumanga dial box.

152
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,554
Rym: Yeah, captain Tyler my favorite show.

153
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:28,239
Rym: I still don't own it.

154
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,274
Scott: Yeah, we'll go clean it out and then we'll fill in the holes from Amazon or something.

155
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:32,534
Scott: Later.

156
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:36,720
Scott: Let's buy another DVD rack Yeah, but maybe they'll be one of clearance.

157
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:44,118
Scott: All right, so the Xbox 360 Didn't sell so well in Japan.

158
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,874
Scott: Nope, well the kotaku does the guys in Japan.

159
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:50,900
Scott: so he pretty much covered the whole thing.

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,090
Scott: He went around Japan to all these stores on the launch day and they were taking pictures of everything and you know They showed this one kind of.

161
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,263
Scott: uh, it wasn't even a store You can enter.

162
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:05,040
Scott: it was in Osaka and it was just one of those stores that faces the street.

163
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,021
Scott: you know, it's just like the wall of a building and there's you buy stuff and there was

164
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:10,361
Rym: a little

165
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:34,534
Scott: tiny tiny line of like two guys and a whole bunch of Xbox 360s and yeah, and He showed the scene from like the huge store in Tokyo And there was a line of about a hundred guys, you know Nice respectable normal line the kind of line you saw when the Game Boy Advance came out, maybe You know, but Didn't sell out?

166
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:37,127
Rym: No, no, not actually.

167
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:40,398
Rym: if I were in Japan, I'd buy two or three and sell them on eBay.

168
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:41,080
Rym: back to the u.s.

169
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:49,520
Scott: Yeah, apparently the only difference According to these people is that the remote control has Japanese characters on it, huh?

170
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:52,490
Scott: And I think the default language is Japanese.

171
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,176
Scott: I don't know about any region coding though.

172
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:55,200
Scott: We still have to find that out.

173
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:59,973
Rym: Yeah, but honestly I'll bet for fanboys having the Japanese remote would be a status symbol.

174
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:00,594
Scott: it would be.

175
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:03,062
Scott: there's also this rumor that they're Selling.

176
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:13,500
Scott: they've already lowered the price to about a hundred and fifty bucks With wait a hundred and fifty bucks in the equivalent yen, but you have to get an ISP contract.

177
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:14,550
Rym: That's fine.

178
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,911
Scott: A hundred and fifty bucks Are you sitting in a contract for the Japanese ISP?

179
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:20,357
Rym: I'll pay that they can't.

180
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:21,220
Rym: they won't be able to sue me.

181
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,179
Rym: I'll say I'll take the contract then I'll just stop paying and keep the Xbox.

182
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:26,615
Rym: Hmm what the hell.

183
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:28,519
Scott: Maybe you could pull it off.

184
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:33,820
Rym: You know easy that would be to refute when your credit card you code the credit card company and say why would I pay?

185
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,426
Rym: For a Japanese ISP.

186
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:36,509
Rym: I don't live in Japan.

187
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,256
Rym: It's obviously identity theft.

188
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,240
Scott: I Guess but you could get in trouble if they find out it's real hard to prosecute anything like that over national boundaries.

189
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,856
Rym: Not that I'm officially advocating anyone.

190
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,319
Rym: try that.

191
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:52,162
Scott: But uh, yeah, I'm definitely Thinking.

192
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:55,276
Scott: I mean, I know some good there was some guys who were podcasting.

193
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:56,200
Scott: they were just in Japan.

194
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:57,998
Scott: I don't know why they didn't take advantage of this.

195
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:00,751
Scott: You know, just pick up some Xbox 360s.

196
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:03,626
Scott: Oh Maybe they'd you what they wouldn't.

197
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:05,597
Scott: let you take them on the plane or ship them or any.

198
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:06,180
Scott: it might be tough.

199
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,539
Rym: Oh, you'd have to ship them to yourself as a gift.

200
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,740
Rym: Yeah, it's tricky, but that's tough because then you can't get a lot of insurance on it.

201
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,060
Rym: So if it gets borked or destroyed you're kind of screwed.

202
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:19,059
Scott: yeah, you have to get like buy like ten of them and send them all separately.

203
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,750
Rym: and Is really just because Michigan happens to be relevant.

204
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,793
Rym: again, we lived in Michigan.

205
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:33,560
Rym: you couldn't bring a lot of stuff over the border and There was a big business in being shipping companies that would ship things over the border kind of surreptitiously.

206
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,479
Rym: You know things like liquor and cigarettes and all that sort of tax type stuff.

207
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:44,296
Scott: So apparently I thought that the leading cause of liver failure was drunkenness.

208
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:45,700
Rym: I figured it was hepatitis.

209
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:47,468
Scott: Yeah, but I does due to drunkenness.

210
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:53,878
Scott: most hepatitis is not caused by drunkenness But anyway, well actually pretty much any liver disease is hepatitis, isn't it?

211
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,180
Rym: Yeah, there are many different kinds of hepatitis and also liver diseases that are not hepatitis.

212
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:04,037
Scott: Anyway, well the leading cause of acute liver failure is let me guess.

213
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:07,147
Rym: Let me guess Tylenol, it's Tylenol.

214
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:11,200
Scott: Well, yeah, actually it's acetaminophen which is Tylenol.

215
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,007
Rym: Yeah, but it's also in other things like well and such it's in almost every Like cold syrupy stuff you drink.

216
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:18,128
Rym: Yep.

217
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:22,523
Scott: The number of cases doubled between 98 and 2003.

218
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:25,373
Scott: Now this guy who is not a doctor or anything.

219
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,120
Scott: He's just a blogger or whatever great.

220
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:29,799
Scott: But he says he noticed something smart.

221
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:42,348
Scott: Over the last several years regular strength Tylenol, which is 325 milligrams Has been disappearing in favor of extra strength 500 milligram Tylenol.

222
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,920
Scott: and he wonders huh?

223
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:50,530
Scott: maybe Deliver disease doubled because the Tylenol strength is increased.

224
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,152
Rym: Huh?

225
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:54,260
Rym: I remember Jerry Seinfeld and his stand-up did a bit about that.

226
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,367
Rym: It was like extra strength.

227
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:59,680
Rym: Yeah, it's just the same thing as before but more.

228
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:05,020
Rym: Yeah, maximum strength just take up with a maximum possible human dose.

229
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,826
Rym: One more drop would kill me.

230
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,170
Rym: back it off a little bit.

231
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:08,532
Scott: It takes.

232
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:13,548
Scott: it takes 4,000 milligrams to Kill you in a day.

233
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:19,291
Scott: so you can take eight Extra strength Tylenols in a day and then you'll be on the edge.

234
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:26,600
Rym: see I personally generally always avoided Tylenol Because I was very acutely aware from when I was young and my I took some Tylenol.

235
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,851
Rym: My doctor always said don't take too much causes liver damage.

236
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:31,456
Rym: Yeah, you're better off taking aspirin.

237
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:34,960
Scott: I avoid drugs in general.

238
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:36,940
Rym: Well, see it's it's weird.

239
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:46,612
Rym: I mean Tylenol was billed when it first appeared or acetaminophen as a safer painkiller because Aspirin the the side effects of aspirin come right out.

240
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:47,617
Rym: Oh and ulcer.

241
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:48,360
Rym: Oh my stomach.

242
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:52,017
Rym: Oh that that are raised syndrome or eye syndrome that kids can get.

243
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:56,604
Scott: yeah That's really all aspirin can do to you is fuck up your stomach or if you take a whole bunch It'll kill you.

244
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:59,323
Scott: Well, of course you take a whole bunch of any of drug It'll kill you.

245
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:02,424
Scott: you take a whole bunch of freaking children's Tylenol It'll kill you.

246
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:04,980
Rym: but Tylenol all the side effects are hidden.

247
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:05,524
Rym: You're not getting.

248
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,391
Rym: your liver is not gonna go.

249
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:07,580
Rym: Oh my liver suddenly.

250
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:16,332
Scott: Yeah, but seriously to get acute liver failure from Tylenol You really need to be taking too much town or take a lot of it.

251
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:18,620
Rym: Take a normal amount too often.

252
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:19,764
Rym: Yeah over a long period.

253
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:26,694
Scott: I'm pretty sure that most of these people dying of acute liver failure and Tylenol are the kind of People who are just like oh something hurts Tylenol.

254
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:31,312
Scott: Oh something hurts town Yeah, and they're just taking it daily multiple times a week all over.

255
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:35,960
Rym: also if you happen to drink in addition That's just a double whammy on the liver, right?

256
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,440
Scott: Oh, yeah, if you friggin drink with Tylenol like oh, I think I'll put some Tylenol in some beer and drink it.

257
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,984
Scott: You're just kill.

258
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:43,589
Scott: That's a kill.

259
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:44,576
Rym: You know, what probably leaves?

260
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,040
Rym: a lot of that?

261
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,488
Rym: Let's see drink all night wake up in the morning.

262
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:49,353
Scott: Hey hangover Tylenol.

263
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:50,357
Rym: See I'm smart.

264
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:53,339
Rym: I got a hangover Aspirin or actually, you know what?

265
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,859
Rym: Multivitamin and orange juice and then I go back to bed.

266
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:57,105
Scott: You know what?

267
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:00,418
Scott: I just don't get drunk and then I don't take Tylenol.

268
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,927
Rym: Yeah We'll see what.

269
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:06,086
Rym: how you do when I open up that pushers rum We'll see.

270
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:11,672
Rym: Yeah, this is definitely an aside, but I Got a hold of just randomly on a whim.

271
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:12,878
Rym: This is definitely an impulse.

272
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:22,287
Rym: buy Pussers rum which is apparently is the same rum that they used on the sailing ships of Britain back in the Horatio Nelson slash horn blower days.

273
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:25,519
Rym: All right, and I got a recipe for grog.

274
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:32,367
Rym: and I'm gonna make grog because I'm curious what it tastes like and I'm gonna give you all an update as to whether Or not it tastes like ass.

275
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:37,953
Scott: I'm not gonna drink it as per my not drinking rule But I'll like put my tongue in it just to see what it tastes like.

276
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:39,600
Scott: so I know what pirates were drinking.

277
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:43,140
Rym: You gotta at least swish it around in your mouth and you can spit it into a bucket like wine testers do.

278
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,353
Scott: I'll probably just drink like a teaspoon of it.

279
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:49,880
Rym: So it doesn't do anything though I gotta say I got some sad commentary for Americans.

280
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:59,593
Rym: We went to the wine store the other day and we were you know looking at wine and they had about a table where they had a bunch of bottles of port and They had samples and you could try the port and I tried.

281
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:00,920
Rym: one actually end up buying a couple bottles.

282
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:10,958
Rym: well one bottle but they had the bucket out and I don't think anyone else there other than the guy giving the samples and me knew what the bucket was for.

283
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:18,200
Rym: because I went and I spit in the bucket because you're supposed to taste the wine and then spit it out so you don't get drunk and I spit in the bucket.

284
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:22,958
Rym: I was the only person who have ever spit in that bark as far as I could tell and there were a lot of people Sampling the wine.

285
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:24,983
Scott: Why why?

286
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:37,556
Scott: why didn't they put a little thing on it like don't think no being a liquor store That's been open for how long that no one ever spits in the bucket Wouldn't it be hilarious if it wasn't actually a spit bucket and it was like something else and you spit in it.

287
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,869
Scott: I Mean you looked in.

288
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:40,999
Scott: there was no spit in there, right?

289
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:43,540
Scott: Yeah, wouldn't it be hilarious?

290
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,114
Scott: It was just a bucket like he was gonna put ice in it or something and then put a bottle in there But no you spit in it.

291
00:16:50,426 --> 00:17:07,980
Rym: The while we're on the topic of Tylenol and disease and all that and since it's Monday, which theoretically is Science Day a little there's some interesting evidence that some forms of childhood cancer may not be caused by environmental factors so much as by pathogens.

292
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:09,847
Scott: Which pathogens?

293
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,253
Rym: maybe the common cold?

294
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:11,857
Rym: They're not sure.

295
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:29,616
Rym: this is Currently the best this research can be called is a statistical anomaly but basically they did a study where they looked at all a lot of cases of childhood cancer in a bunch of regions in London or Britain somewhere in Britain and They noticed something odd.

296
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:43,480
Rym: apparently when a disease breaks out The disease spreads in certain ways that you can analyze statistically and you can say like wow This was a disease because look it's spread in clusters in this type of way in this time this place, whatever

297
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:44,122
Scott: Mm-hmm

298
00:17:44,563 --> 00:18:01,579
Rym: and diseases or illnesses that are caused by environmental factors like poisons or pollution or carcinogens Tend to cluster in the same area over a long period of time to cluster a different way and you can see these patterns in the long term by looking at who got what disease when and where?

299
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,600
Rym: and The data coming back from the study, which they were studying something completely different.

300
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:18,679
Rym: But they discovered that the cancer in childhood seems to be clustering and this is 8% above what was expected Statistically in space time as opposed to in space.

301
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:25,700
Rym: So it's it's happening in areas at a certain time in a cluster and then disappearing instead of happening in one area repeatedly.

302
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:35,380
Rym: hmm, which would Lend one to believe that these cancers are being caused by some sort of pathogen more likely than some sort of environmental factor?

303
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:39,786
Rym: Hmm this is very preliminary Evidence, but there's.

304
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:46,287
Rym: it's a statistical anomaly and they're looking into it and the most obvious culprit They seem to believe is the common cold.

305
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:48,155
Scott: Well, the common cold is a virus, right?

306
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:54,346
Scott: Yes, so don't bash my Rudimentary biological knowledge.

307
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,997
Scott: but a virus goes in a cell, right?

308
00:18:57,077 --> 00:19:02,419
Scott: It makes mischief Yeah, and then the cell explodes and a bunch of viruses come out and they go for more cells, right?

309
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:03,643
Rym: It alters.

310
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:08,316
Rym: well some viruses alter the cells DNA some use their RNA to the retro viruses.

311
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:09,178
Rym: you right right right?

312
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:17,845
Scott: that sort of and Those sorts of things as in destroying cells and modifying cells would be the kind of thing to cause cancer Would it not possibly one thing though?

313
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,089
Scott: It does make a little sense.

314
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:27,519
Rym: They're suggesting that possibly it's a common illness Coupled with some sort of genetic predisposition and the two together cancer.

315
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:37,880
Scott: So if your DNA was such-and-such and you got the common cold The common cold would normally modify someone's DNA to make some common coldness.

316
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:43,620
Scott: But if you have DNA that's messed up and the common cold comes in there and makes a cancer that's one of the theories.

317
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:52,039
Rym: it also has a nice blurb at the end about how it's important for kids to be exposed to diseases but at the right times and All this sorts of cool stuff.

318
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:54,853
Rym: I'd like to see the real study But I don't have access to that sort of.

319
00:19:54,974 --> 00:20:08,900
Rym: if it's true Then maybe the common cold plus cancer could be some sort of arbitrary Darwinian push possibly in certain DNA Except that there's actually a fairly good track record of treating many forms of childhood cancer.

320
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:14,040
Scott: Yeah, which is a good thing a lot easier than treating some old guy who's got like a stomach full of cancer.

321
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:21,213
Rym: Well in some ways, I mean sure children are more resilient But at the same time children aren't as mature emotionally to handle that.

322
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:27,720
Rym: imagine being five and a guy in a suit Sticks a needle in your arm and says you've got cancer your life's going to suck for the next three years.

323
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:35,020
Scott: Yeah, but I mean, you know emotional troubles you might not be able to cure but you can at least cure the physical things easier.

324
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:42,224
Scott: Yeah, I mean like it seems like everywhere I look I mean, this isn't statistical or scientific at all All right anecdotal here.

325
00:20:42,244 --> 00:20:42,625
Rym: Yeah.

326
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,167
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:20:43,448 --> 00:20:47,676
Scott: I see a lot of old people who die of cancer and I see a lot of young people Who survived it?

328
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:49,645
Rym: Yeah, I'm not.

329
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:51,213
Rym: I mean, I'm not saying the emotional effect.

330
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:56,160
Rym: I mean, it's just more of a. It's harder to help a child deal with something like that emotionally.

331
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:58,505
Rym: Oh, yeah, and that's why I didn't expect to.

332
00:20:58,565 --> 00:20:59,608
Rym: but big plug here.

333
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:00,570
Rym: child's play.

334
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:01,744
Scott: Mm-hmm.

335
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:03,420
Rym: penny arcade runs a charity.

336
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:05,132
Rym: You probably all know it since you're all geeks.

337
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:12,633
Rym: you listen to our show Where you donate money to child's play and or you donate video games or games or you just go to their Amazon list and buy Something.

338
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:20,095
Rym: yeah and they distribute these goods to Children with cancer and children in hospital and children who have nothing else to do because they're on chemotherapy things like that.

339
00:21:20,115 --> 00:21:27,120
Rym: Mm-hmm and While we tell you to be leery of certain charities because they waste the money child's play doesn't waste the money.

340
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:29,368
Scott: It's a it's the only 100% safe charity.

341
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:29,709
Scott: I know.

342
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,231
Rym: Yep.

343
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:33,764
Rym: They even show pictures of here's the giant pile of things We're about to distribute.

344
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:35,471
Scott: Yeah the first year they had that pile.

345
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:36,335
Scott: That was too too big.

346
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:38,665
Scott: Yeah, this is the third year I think isn't it it is.

347
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:41,037
Rym: Well every year it's grown just gangbusters.

348
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:46,220
Scott: Yep You know, I never really went to the hospital because I'm too healthy.

349
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:47,443
Rym: Actually, I did.

350
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:53,741
Rym: I had a very dangerous flu and I was hospitalized for a slightly significant part of my early childhood What's.

351
00:21:54,163 --> 00:22:07,355
Scott: but anyway when I went to the orthodontist and it was gonna hurt that game boy was freaking awesome Played some Zelda or some Metroid 2 and oh, yeah, that was that was the greatest.

352
00:22:07,596 --> 00:22:14,420
Scott: So I imagine if I had Cancer or a broken leg that a nice GBA.

353
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:16,145
Scott: That'd be freaking great.

354
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:16,829
Scott: Yeah.

355
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:23,979
Rym: Yeah, and without it it would freakin suck Especially for kids who their parents can't really get him anything because they're paying all the medical bills.

356
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:25,760
Scott: Yeah, absolutely.

357
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:35,460
Scott: So, you know, I know there are children's hospitals out there that you know, don't have the video games But child's play is definitely cutting that number way down.

358
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:42,705
Rym: Yes, and anything that improved the increases the number of video games out there is just a win for me Mm-hmm and a win for kids with cancer.

359
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:51,120
Scott: So what you got schmo?

360
00:22:51,902 --> 00:22:53,646
Rym: How do you like our new thing of the day music?

361
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:56,514
Scott: I don't know because we added in later.

362
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:57,176
Scott: Yeah.

363
00:22:57,236 --> 00:22:57,357
Rym: Yeah.

364
00:22:57,638 --> 00:22:59,063
Rym: Yeah That's like.

365
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:01,095
Scott: I heard part of it, but I didn't hear the final product.

366
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:01,940
Scott: I'll tell you tomorrow.

367
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:05,490
Rym: That's like finding out that the late shows you like are recorded during the day.

368
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:06,252
Scott: They are.

369
00:23:06,272 --> 00:23:11,599
Scott: that's why that's why they're not sleeping during theirs And we are ours is actually recorded at night.

370
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:12,540
Rym: We're GeekNights.

371
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:20,238
Rym: See the reason it's GeekNights is because we started recording it at night and doing it the next day and then we decided screw That we'll just put it out at night after we finish it.

372
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,167
Scott: Yeah, like at midnight 1 a.m.

373
00:23:22,428 --> 00:23:23,392
Scott: Whenever we put it out.

374
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:27,520
Rym: But anyway my thing of the day I I'm really not sure how I found this.

375
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,320
Rym: I think someone just linked me to it at work and I stumbled upon it somehow.

376
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:38,682
Rym: But basically it's just this site where people keep uploading cute pictures and it's kind of like your daily shot in the arm of cute Things.

377
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:40,829
Scott: I don't need that.

378
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,653
Rym: I like stuff like that.

379
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:43,680
Rym: They have a little plushie flu virus.

380
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:47,160
Rym: I've seen that before a little sugar glider flying through someone's house.

381
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,927
Scott: I don't even know what that animal was till I saw that picture.

382
00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:52,080
Rym: Yeah flying squirrel really cute really friendly big eyes fluffy.

383
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:54,399
Scott: Yeah, like where the hell do they sell those?

384
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,343
Rym: Exotic pet shops.

385
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:58,110
Rym: They're actually not that uncommon.

386
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,880
Scott: a swing in his pet shop in town.

387
00:24:02,462 --> 00:24:04,100
Rym: Actually a friend in high school had a sugar glider.

388
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,059
Rym: No She also had a baby fox and it was probably the cutest animal I've ever played with.

389
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:11,171
Scott: well when it got older didn't it turn into a nasty evil Fox?

390
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:12,275
Rym: actually, it's really sad.

391
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:13,479
Rym: it got crushed by a board.

392
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:19,295
Rym: a Board a giant piece of wood fell over in their basement and crushed it one day.

393
00:24:19,596 --> 00:24:20,720
Scott: What was it doing in the basement?

394
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,423
Rym: It was just down there.

395
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,209
Rym: They didn't think the board would fall over.

396
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,015
Scott: It was doing evil Fox things.

397
00:24:26,356 --> 00:24:27,340
Rym: foxes aren't evil.

398
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,586
Scott: Yeah, they're harassing people.

399
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,011
Rym: Anyway, they're not harassing people.

400
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:32,156
Rym: They're hungry and they see a chickens.

401
00:24:32,176 --> 00:24:33,160
Rym: They kill the chicken and eat it.

402
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:35,120
Scott: Yeah, it's great for the chicken farmer.

403
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,646
Scott: Damn foxes fox isn't useful to people.

404
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:42,095
Scott: chicken is anyway, so is that all you got?

405
00:24:42,878 --> 00:24:42,978
Rym: Yeah.

406
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:43,740
Rym: Yeah, that's all I got.

407
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:46,287
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure when people look at the cute pictures.

408
00:24:46,307 --> 00:24:47,149
Scott: They'll get more out of it.

409
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:51,200
Scott: So, um, there's a thing some guy wrote on Craigslist.

410
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:52,084
Scott: It's pretty old.

411
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,535
Scott: It's from March 2004, but I just found it.

412
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:55,560
Scott: I'm a little late to the party.

413
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,730
Rym: Well, you know, there's this thing called the internet.

414
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:04,840
Scott: Yeah, it's a very, you know, it wasn't Big on the internet maybe in some areas, but not in my field of vision.

415
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:05,925
Scott: But you know, you're.

416
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:09,179
Rym: you'd better pray that I haven't already seen what you're about to talk about.

417
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:10,605
Scott: I'm Brian.

418
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:11,088
Scott: All right.

419
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,314
Scott: Anyway, it's called.

420
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:18,475
Scott: Hey crackhead and This guy wrote this little kind of essay letter to these crackheads.

421
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:27,913
Scott: now The thing is is the guy was I think he was hanging with his girlfriend in the city or something like that and he had a motorcycle.

422
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:34,880
Scott: and One day he came outside and the motorcycle the spark plugs were sawed off.

423
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,320
Scott: Why the spark plugs of his motorcycle were sawed off?

424
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:46,300
Rym: What kind of a jerk would you have to be to saw off the spark plugs of some dudes motorcycle and he's like what the hell?

425
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:57,399
Scott: He's like, alright, so he freakin, you know takes it to the you know the shop and he gets everything fixed and he had to pay a ticket for leaving it on the Street that night and everything and it sucked.

426
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:10,680
Scott: So he finally got it fixed and when he got there the guy told him You know that crackheads cut spark plugs off of bikes to use them as crack pipes.

427
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:16,877
Rym: Um, I submit to you that you can buy a top-the-line spark plug for about a dollar.

428
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:17,920
Scott: Yeah, okay.

429
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:23,080
Scott: So this guy ended up paying a hundred dollars to fix his bike at the shop.

430
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:28,054
Scott: And he says but then I remember that I just paid $100 for your crack pipes.

431
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:33,696
Scott: Dot dot dot, you know, there's so many choice lines.

432
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:34,700
Scott: I can't read the whole thing.

433
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,794
Scott: You're just gonna have to visit it.

434
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:40,960
Scott: But um, you know, so he bought a few extra spark plugs and he like taped them to his bike.

435
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:43,015
Scott: So he's like here you want crack pipes here.

436
00:26:43,055 --> 00:26:49,580
Scott: They are Right, but again, they screwed up his bike and cut off one of the spark plugs and he had tools.

437
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,978
Scott: He had extra spark plugs and he was ready for it, right?

438
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:55,519
Scott: But he didn't have the right size ratchet and you didn't have the right size thing.

439
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:59,840
Scott: So you have to go to the store and get a different ratchet and everything and he's pissed off again, right?

440
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,480
Scott: And he says and he says alright, I'm rambling but the point is crackhead.

441
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:05,920
Scott: You've done me wrong.

442
00:27:06,623 --> 00:27:08,633
Scott: Now I get that you love crack.

443
00:27:08,914 --> 00:27:10,140
Scott: That is totally understandable.

444
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:13,020
Scott: I've heard it's really fun at first and quite addictive.

445
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:14,584
Scott: But I don't understand.

446
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:17,351
Scott: is you are is all caps this last sentence.

447
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:19,215
Scott: You are a crackhead.

448
00:27:19,496 --> 00:27:21,140
Scott: Why don't you own a crack pipe?

449
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,991
Rym: What they probably keep losing it.

450
00:27:28,394 --> 00:27:29,140
Scott: I'm an engineer.

451
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:33,180
Scott: Do you ever see me shaking down bums in the loin for a calculator and slide rule?

452
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:35,948
Scott: No, you don't because engineering is the main thing I do.

453
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:37,995
Scott: I went and bought myself a calculator.

454
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:39,640
Scott: the main thing you do is crack.

455
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:41,859
Scott: How do you get by without a crack pipe?

456
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:50,960
Scott: The other crackheads must clown you non-stop, I mean the fucking saw you used to saw off my spark plugs.

457
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,588
Scott: It's probably worth five or ten bucks.

458
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:54,919
Scott: Why not sell or trade it for a crack pipe?

459
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,838
Scott: You haven't put much thought into this.

460
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:05,999
Scott: And then he just goes this stuff before that and after that but he basically it's his open letter to the damn crackheads.

461
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,533
Scott: like Goddamnit, leave my bike alone.

462
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:13,560
Scott: You fucking crackhead It's just hilarious and it's so well-written.

463
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:17,858
Rym: All right, I'll admit that I have not seen this and I'm gonna read it after I finish the show.

464
00:28:17,878 --> 00:28:20,319
Scott: Yeah Yeah, I guarantee you Sarah go laughing.

465
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:26,020
Rym: All right, so we don't have music for our credit.

466
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:30,079
Rym: Yeah, great ice capades.

467
00:28:31,322 --> 00:28:37,873
Rym: Yeah inside joke anyway, so uh Well this we were inspired to do this because of one of our friends this weekend.

468
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:39,016
Scott: Yeah genius.

469
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:40,020
Rym: He's a smart guy.

470
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:41,426
Rym: We like him a lot.

471
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:42,411
Rym: He's a good friend.

472
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:46,191
Rym: He likes the board games the video games And he likes the pcs.

473
00:28:46,694 --> 00:28:47,498
Scott: everyone likes the pcs.

474
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:50,815
Rym: I mean, it's the number one tool and he wants to buy a new PC.

475
00:28:51,056 --> 00:29:01,917
Rym: definitely needs one Can't can't agree more and we've realized that a lot of people even really geeky people Grossly over or underestimate what they actually need a PC for.

476
00:29:01,937 --> 00:29:11,607
Rym: yep So, uh today's show is how to buy a goddamn computer or how to at least choose a computer How to not get ripped off.

477
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:13,856
Scott: Yeah, don't buy more than you need.

478
00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:14,880
Scott: Don't buy less than you need.

479
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,306
Scott: Don't spend more than you need.

480
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:16,949
Rym: Yeah.

481
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:19,240
Scott: Oh and make don't buy something that's gonna fall apart.

482
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:22,200
Rym: And just so you know We take our own medicine.

483
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:27,859
Rym: Scott has a pretty fancy fast computer because he replaced the oldest most decrepit computer we had.

484
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,240
Rym: My computer is now the oldest most decrepit computer.

485
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:38,905
Rym: Yeah My previous computer is the shittiest computer in the house and I have not upgraded my computer because it's fast enough to the podcast And I don't need it for anything else.

486
00:29:39,226 --> 00:29:39,427
Scott: Yep.

487
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:43,220
Scott: So anyway, our friend he's like, yeah, I need a new computer, right?

488
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,007
Scott: And I'm like, all right.

489
00:29:45,027 --> 00:29:48,160
Scott: Well, you should probably get a Mac Mini cuz I knew what he needed, right?

490
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:52,496
Scott: And I knew that he wasn't so good with putting computers together.

491
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:53,882
Scott: cuz no offense Cuz.

492
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:58,140
Scott: once he did hold a stick of RAM and walk across a carpet while wearing a sweater and wool socks.

493
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:00,128
Rym: God, I forgot about that.

494
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:02,100
Scott: Yes, so I was like you should get a Mac Mini.

495
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:05,440
Scott: That's all that would be perfect for you because you wouldn't worry about this evil spy.

496
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:05,842
Scott: Where is?

497
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:07,653
Scott: you would have your web you'd have your email you'd have your.

498
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:08,900
Scott: I am you'd everything you need.

499
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,664
Scott: It would be cute.

500
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:10,971
Scott: It'd be powerful.

501
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:11,595
Scott: It would look good.

502
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:12,520
Scott: You'd be happy, right?

503
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:16,239
Scott: Now he was kind of wary of this because he wanted to play the games.

504
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:19,772
Scott: Right and I'm like, alright what games are you gonna play?

505
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:22,200
Scott: you haven't played a PC game in two years.

506
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:28,120
Scott: The most games that he I could see him playing was half-life 2 which is understandable with the whole steam.

507
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:32,494
Scott: That's the only thing I keep windows for yep, and maybe a couple MMOs.

508
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:34,300
Scott: if he decided to get into them, right?

509
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,725
Scott: Now, okay that would.

510
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:52,778
Scott: those three games would cost him maybe about a hundred and fifty dollars and two monthly fees at most Right, but the difference between a computer that could run those games and a computer that would do everything else He needed except run those games would be about eight hundred

511
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:53,159
Rym: dollars.

512
00:30:54,242 --> 00:31:00,067
Scott: Okay, I guess if those games are worth nine hundred and fifty dollars Plus, you know what?

513
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:02,859
Rym: for nine hundred and fifty dollars you can buy an Xbox and a pile of games.

514
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:08,477
Scott: Yeah, and this guy now that would be alright, you know for just about anyone except for that.

515
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:14,680
Scott: ten minutes earlier He was complaining that he couldn't get Paper Mario because it was still thirty five bucks at the store.

516
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:15,826
Scott: That was too rich for him.

517
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:32,839
Scott: So I'm like, oh you can't buy Paper Mario Which is awesome and is 30 hours of fun for 35 bucks But you can pay nine hundred and fifty extra dollars for a computer to play three lousy games Versus the $400 computer that'll do everything else you need better than you need it to do.

518
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:42,379
Rym: So I guess the first rule is if you're gonna buy a computer and you really need one Or you're serious about getting one sit down and just write down or use your computer to sit at the computer you have now.

519
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:46,740
Rym: Use it for a while and write down every program you run in the course of an hour.

520
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:50,719
Rym: I guarantee the list is gonna be a lot smaller than you think it will be.

521
00:31:51,101 --> 00:32:12,720
Scott: I mean, I have quite a few programs on my computer, but all I really use is Firefox email aim media playing SSH text editing maybe word processing Maybe maybe maybe Spreadsheet or money keeping track of and you know some of those things I could do on the web.

522
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:15,480
Rym: You can buy a computer for about a hundred dollars.

523
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,905
Rym: That'll do all that adequately.

524
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:17,206
Scott: hell.

525
00:32:17,286 --> 00:32:25,093
Scott: an apple 2gs from 1986 will do all that if you upgrade it and you're madly Yeah, but if you're not madly spend a couple hundred bucks and get a real.

526
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:26,920
Scott: just get a normal normal computer.

527
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:29,439
Scott: We'll do all of those things just fine.

528
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:35,519
Scott: A normal normal computer will do all of those things better than you can possibly need.

529
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,249
Rym: Now also, there's the.

530
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,160
Rym: there's the level of computer you need.

531
00:32:40,562 --> 00:32:43,036
Rym: So once you pick like I'm gonna get I'm not gonna get a Mac Mini.

532
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:43,559
Rym: I'm gonna get a PC.

533
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,319
Rym: I want a PC because I want to play games.

534
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:53,734
Rym: Think about what games you want to play Because a crap old computer will play everything up to and including counter-strike natural selection.

535
00:32:53,995 --> 00:32:57,104
Rym: the previous generation of FPS is perfectly Hell.

536
00:32:57,164 --> 00:33:06,020
Scott: if you get nowadays you can get GeForce 4 and Like a pile of RAM and all kinds of stuff for still really freaking cheap.

537
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:09,700
Scott: You only have to pay out the ass if you want top-of-the-line stuff.

538
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,273
Rym: I mean consider this my current computer can play any half-life 1 based steam game.

539
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:20,069
Rym: So counter-strike natural selection ricochet All the battlefield whatever all those games.

540
00:33:20,189 --> 00:33:20,370
Scott: Yep.

541
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:32,189
Rym: My computer is a 1 gigahertz Thunderbird 512 megabytes of old-style PC 2100 DDR RAM and a GeForce 2 yep.

542
00:33:33,582 --> 00:33:51,313
Scott: So if you get a new computer right now with an Athlon XP or a low-end Maybe a sempron or the crummiest f AMD 64 512 megs of nice DDR RAM a GeForce 4 A cheap GeForce 4.

543
00:33:51,313 --> 00:33:52,060
Rym: not the top-of-the-line.

544
00:33:52,441 --> 00:34:05,000
Scott: Yeah, the built-in video the built-in one might not do it if you really want to play a game But it'll do it for anything but games Any game but half-life 2. well, no, you can actually play half-life 2 if you have a real geforce 4.

545
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,272
Scott: It just won't be the greatest half-life 2 experience.

546
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:11,480
Scott: up to turn the graphics down a little bit Yeah, which isn't acceptable for me, but your taste may differ.

547
00:34:11,873 --> 00:34:24,217
Scott: Yeah I mean if you if you're not gonna be playing half-life 2 hardcore and competitions are going to mad land parties The good geforce 4 or maybe a lower number geforce FX will totally pull you through.

548
00:34:24,257 --> 00:34:25,400
Scott: you'll be you'll be just fine.

549
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:27,599
Rym: I mean do you need to play half-life 2 right now?

550
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:33,080
Rym: I mean you can play it right now for an extra five hundred dollars on top of what you're gonna buy anyway.

551
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:34,668
Rym: Or you can wait a year.

552
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:36,620
Rym: buy a four hundred dollar computer.

553
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:41,967
Rym: That'll play half-life 2 perfectly and you won't be able to play the next generation game Which is fine because you never played half-life 2.

554
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:54,860
Scott: the expensive the really really expensive computers that the The the greater than one thousand dollar computers only really makes sense If you are hardcore playing a whole bunch of PC games all the time.

555
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:57,879
Rym: Yeah, if PC gaming is your thing by all means splurge.

556
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,393
Rym: Yeah, unless you're a hardcore gamer always buy this the one generation back of everything.

557
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,697
Rym: You'll save so much money.

558
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:04,520
Rym: Oh my god.

559
00:35:04,781 --> 00:35:09,580
Scott: Yep, and I mean I used to be big in the PC gaming, you know.

560
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,180
Scott: So my current computer like I can I can play a lot of PC games on it, but I didn't pay too much for it.

561
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,889
Scott: I only paid $1,000 in the day.

562
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:28,711
Rym: Yeah, you know I paid about $3,600 for my computer, but that was in the year 2000 Mm-hmm, and that included the 19 inch CRT that I still have to this day.

563
00:35:29,112 --> 00:35:34,215
Rym: the SCSI card and the SCSI CD burner CD RW didn't really exist yet.

564
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:34,296
Rym: Yep.

565
00:35:35,423 --> 00:35:42,440
Scott: So anyway, if you want to if you need a new computer What you need to do is make a list of the things you're gonna do with it.

566
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:52,879
Scott: So I went to CompUSA once and actually there was a smart guy who was he was shopping for a computer Like I never saw anyone shop for one before because usually I go around that I'm like, how fast is it?

567
00:35:53,561 --> 00:35:54,851
Scott: You know, what's the video card?

568
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:55,960
Scott: how much RAM is in there?

569
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,683
Scott: Cuz I know I can.

570
00:35:57,025 --> 00:36:04,980
Scott: I know that on that level this guy He wasn't a computer literate guy like like we are but he knew the right questions to ask.

571
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:07,019
Scott: He was like, will it burn a CD?

572
00:36:07,901 --> 00:36:10,859
Scott: Can I plug my video camera into it and make a DVD with it?

573
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:12,909
Scott: You know, he at he won.

574
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:14,760
Scott: he knew what he wanted to do with the computer.

575
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:18,439
Scott: He wanted a device that did X Y & Z and he said does this one do X Y & Z?

576
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:21,860
Scott: I want the cheapest one that does X Y & Z reliably and well.

577
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:26,212
Scott: And that's what you have to do when you get a computer now, that's just the hardware.

578
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:29,868
Rym: and while we're very pro Linux there That's another thing to look at.

579
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,339
Rym: Windows cost money.

580
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,711
Rym: You don't buy a Dell or a gateway.

581
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,379
Rym: Windows cost a lot of money.

582
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:41,180
Scott: See any other thing is when even if you buy a Dell you're still paying for Windows whether you know it or not.

583
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:46,420
Rym: However, you're all really only paying about 30 bucks for Windows in that case because they pretty much give it to Dell for free.

584
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,457
Scott: Yeah, but you are still paying for it.

585
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,265
Rym: But basically you've got to consider if you build a computer yourself because there's two different cases here Do you really need Windows?

586
00:36:55,666 --> 00:37:01,060
Rym: because if you don't get Windows that's two hundred and fifty dollars of more computer you can buy.

587
00:37:01,481 --> 00:37:15,748
Scott: Yeah, also if you compare if you look at the Dell heart just the hardware alone and you try to build the equivalent computer Especially if you use an AMD processor, you know, which is just as good as an Intel processor If not better, it'll

588
00:37:15,768 --> 00:37:16,756
Rym: be less than half the cost.

589
00:37:16,816 --> 00:37:19,978
Scott: Yeah it'll be less than half the cost and faster.

590
00:37:19,998 --> 00:37:25,352
Scott: and You know while Windows is technically only $30 of the Dell computer.

591
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,596
Scott: What's all that other money?

592
00:37:26,776 --> 00:37:28,020
Scott: That's the Dell profit.

593
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:33,260
Scott: Yep, you can avoid all of that and give the money straight to the people who actually make the parts.

594
00:37:33,702 --> 00:37:45,520
Scott: the only thing is you either need someone to build it for you build it yourself and While building it yourself is not for a complete idiot to do it is so much easier than anyone will let on.

595
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:47,327
Rym: I mean quite seriously.

596
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:50,460
Rym: you open your computer and you see all the connectors are all different sizes and shapes.

597
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,788
Rym: You can't plug anything in wrong.

598
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:54,434
Rym: Nothing will let you plug it in wrong.

599
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:55,438
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't fit.

600
00:37:55,558 --> 00:38:01,859
Rym: flip it around It'll fit or you're plugging it into the wrong spot And if you just try everything on everything eventually everything's gonna be in the right space.

601
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:12,538
Scott: Yep The only trick is knowing that Which ones have to be connected because some of the holes don't have to be connected to anything and some of them do Yeah, but I consider that I mean, what's it worth to you?

602
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,251
Rym: Do you are you confident that you'll be able to diagnose a problem?

603
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:18,920
Rym: if you're really not and you don't want to worry about it?

604
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:20,165
Rym: Yeah, I get the Dell.

605
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:26,479
Scott: it'll be slower, but you'll get their tech support at least for whatever it's worth And it'll probably work as soon as you bring it home and turn it on.

606
00:38:27,162 --> 00:38:31,300
Rym: Because that's actually I mean, I always recommend build your own computer and there are a lot of reasons for that.

607
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,203
Rym: You'll know what's in it.

608
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,848
Rym: You'll learn a lot about computers.

609
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,715
Rym: You'll generally get a good deal.

610
00:38:35,735 --> 00:38:37,140
Rym: Yeah, all those things.

611
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:42,940
Rym: But say you're say your parents need a computer or your little brother going to school needs a computer.

612
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:47,220
Rym: Now normally you say oh, I'll build it for you, but then there's a problem.

613
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,979
Rym: They call you when it comes time to do tech support.

614
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:55,631
Scott: So the trick is if you're gonna do that You have to make damn well sure that nothing's gonna happen to that computer.

615
00:38:55,651 --> 00:38:59,308
Rym: or you tell your parents to buy a Dell and you'd never Speak of it again.

616
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:05,759
Scott: Yeah, some of my parents I built them a computer and it worked out pretty well because I threw the Ubuntu on there and they never have a problem.

617
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,540
Scott: when They had Windows they kept calling me about spyware and stuff and it sucked.

618
00:39:10,302 --> 00:39:13,332
Scott: But now I gave them Ubuntu and I set up everything.

619
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:16,599
Scott: everything they complained about, you know, it doesn't do this It doesn't do that.

620
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,560
Scott: I fixed all of those problems and now they don't call me anymore because Ubuntu doesn't break.

621
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:23,350
Scott: Yeah, and they can't break it because it's not Windows.

622
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:24,916
Rym: and look they're using Linux.

623
00:39:24,936 --> 00:39:26,851
Rym: These are people who I mean I've met his parents.

624
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:29,408
Rym: They are not Technological people not at all.

625
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:30,031
Rym: They do not.

626
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:33,771
Rym: they don't know what this Linux thing is But they kind of know now because they've been using it.

627
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:35,057
Scott: You know, I actually brag to their friends.

628
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:38,393
Scott: really Yeah, that's kind of cool because their friends go why is your computer different?

629
00:39:38,413 --> 00:39:42,114
Scott: and they're like, oh we have Linux It doesn't crash like your computer.

630
00:39:42,134 --> 00:39:46,372
Rym: Yeah, no I mean, I remember they were leery at first but you know what.

631
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:48,380
Rym: there was a button that started a web browser.

632
00:39:48,744 --> 00:39:50,119
Rym: There is a button that started email.

633
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:55,059
Rym: They didn't do much else and when they really wanted to do something else They had to either learn how to do it or not do it.

634
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,750
Rym: Yeah, and then they realized there wasn't much else.

635
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,480
Scott: That's all they use is aim in Firefox.

636
00:39:58,582 --> 00:39:59,820
Scott: They don't use anything else at all.

637
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,141
Scott: They could.

638
00:40:00,262 --> 00:40:05,360
Scott: if they had an aim in Firefox machine that had all the aim the Firefox plugins they needed they would be set.

639
00:40:05,622 --> 00:40:07,319
Scott: They don't need anything else at all.

640
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,438
Rym: Seriously you out there our listeners really don't use your computer for much.

641
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:16,015
Rym: almost No one does because the people who use their computer for something weird already know what they need.

642
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:16,416
Scott: Yep.

643
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:19,327
Scott: They already have Linux Yeah, or a Mac.

644
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:23,622
Rym: I mean say if you're if you want to do a podcast or something an Apple is really the best way To go.

645
00:40:23,642 --> 00:40:26,640
Scott: Yeah, we're using Linux just because you don't have an Apple.

646
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:30,109
Rym: Yeah we seriously considered buying a Mac just to do our this podcast.

647
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:35,908
Scott: when it comes to arts and media and audio and video and Graphics the Mac is where it's at.

648
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:38,980
Rym: I mean if you want to do image editing there are a lot of but there's the gimp.

649
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,309
Rym: There's mature platforms that'll work in Linux.

650
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,000
Rym: If you want to do audio, there are fairly mature platforms.

651
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:46,611
Rym: There's still no flash equivalent that works.

652
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:48,680
Rym: There's still no Maya that works.

653
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:50,453
Rym: No, I'm not gonna even pretend there is.

654
00:40:50,675 --> 00:40:55,913
Scott: if you do that stuff You can't use Linux this blender which a lot of people are using but it does.

655
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:56,996
Scott: it's not quite the same.

656
00:40:57,176 --> 00:40:57,557
Scott: Yeah.

657
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:07,895
Scott: Yeah But anyway, the only real reason to use Windows is if you really want to play the games Or if there's some proprietary program you really need to use.

658
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:09,320
Scott: that has no alternative.

659
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,860
Rym: Yeah, which really only applies if you are a company.

660
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:21,331
Scott: Yeah, companies are the ones that often have things and like a proprietary database You know and they can't get it out and you know what.

661
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:27,320
Rym: honestly if you really need something to run Most Windows programs you can run them in Linux.

662
00:41:27,724 --> 00:41:37,207
Rym: You'll have to learn how to use wine Which is actually not that easy because Windows is weird and wine is a wine is a weird Implementation of that weird interface.

663
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:40,560
Scott: Yeah, this is a little mini rant that's kind of related to that.

664
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:49,509
Scott: But there's a difference people don't often see it between easy to learn and easy to use Like Linux is not easy to learn if you know.

665
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:53,480
Scott: if you only know Windows and because you already know Windows Windows is easy to learn.

666
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,900
Rym: Yeah, we're not gonna pretend it's easy to learn.

667
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,160
Rym: I mean, well, we'll do a whole show sometime and we really will on Linux and what it is and why it's different.

668
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:09,432
Scott: Yeah I mean if you only if you don't only use Windows and you figure out that the Firefox is the big blue E Then you'll be able to browse the web and Linux like nothing.

669
00:42:09,472 --> 00:42:13,460
Scott: if someone else sets of Ubuntu or something for you You know, that's that's not the hard part.

670
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:18,720
Scott: But really, you know being able to use your computer like you use your Windows computer is gonna take learning.

671
00:42:19,423 --> 00:42:30,647
Rym: but the difference is is that Linux is easy to use and That once you know it it's a snap because once you learn how to fix a certain problem one You'll fix it and you'll never have that problem again.

672
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:34,519
Scott: Yep, and it's also think the best example people give is VI.

673
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:37,600
Scott: VI is hella hard to learn.

674
00:42:37,861 --> 00:42:44,880
Scott: I mean the commands for VI are like push rant seemingly random keys on the keyboard to make things happen.

675
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:56,632
Rym: Yes I I actually have witnessed hilarity especially at RIT and at my job where someone starts VI to type something And they try to type and it won't type and then they can't make the program stop.

676
00:42:57,194 --> 00:42:57,956
Rym: They don't get out.

677
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,862
Scott: I Mean escape.

678
00:42:59,903 --> 00:43:02,271
Scott: colon WQ is how you save and quit?

679
00:43:02,432 --> 00:43:02,934
Rym: Yeah VI is it.

680
00:43:02,974 --> 00:43:04,680
Rym: you can also do the text editor.

681
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,695
Rym: I don't know if we said that and you might not know Yeah.

682
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,594
Scott: But anyway, the point is is that you'll never learn.

683
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:15,660
Scott: in order to learn VI You have to read books and practice and get used to it over many many moons and this isn't being condescending.

684
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,247
Rym: We had to learn it and read books.

685
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:27,300
Scott: Yeah, I'm still not the master and I use it every day But the thing is is that once you learn it think about this in wind in Microsoft Word if you want to delete five lines of text, right?

686
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:34,100
Scott: You have to click drag and select very precisely those five lines of text and hit backspace.

687
00:43:34,562 --> 00:43:37,332
Scott: That's easy to learn but it takes a little while.

688
00:43:37,854 --> 00:43:38,476
Scott: in VI.

689
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:41,446
Scott: I press d5d That's the easiest thing in the world.

690
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:42,771
Scott: delete five lines of text.

691
00:43:43,052 --> 00:43:45,440
Scott: I pushed three keys did it and they're gone immediately.

692
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:47,105
Scott: That's real easy to do.

693
00:43:47,807 --> 00:43:52,280
Scott: but to learn that you have to learn something and that's what Linux is about.

694
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,155
Rym: Yep, and we're just building a computer is about I'm saying one is better than the other.

695
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:57,360
Rym: There's just two different approaches.

696
00:43:57,541 --> 00:44:00,940
Rym: Are you willing to not want to learn and then that's fine.

697
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:10,700
Rym: And it's really easy to learn how to do new things, but you won't be able to do them quickly or optimally Yep, or are you gonna spend all that time and effort and it's not that easy sometimes?

698
00:44:11,763 --> 00:44:13,620
Rym: And then you'll be able to do things quickly and optimally.

699
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,700
Scott: Mm-hmm, and that's what building a computer is all about is that you have to learn something to build your own computer.

700
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:22,300
Scott: But in the end everything will be awesome for you once it's built.

701
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:28,720
Scott: You'll save a pile of money and your computer will be all slick and you won't have crashes and viruses and who knows?

702
00:44:29,204 --> 00:44:29,875
Scott: It'll just be great.

703
00:44:30,603 --> 00:44:37,819
Scott: But if you get a Dell you don't have to learn anything But it's not going to be so great later and it might not be the easiest to use.

704
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:45,726
Rym: Now we just realized as we've been talking for pretty much as long as we wanted to talk in one show that there's a lot More to this topic than we can cover.

705
00:44:45,907 --> 00:44:49,120
Scott: Yeah one show like which parts to select and such.

706
00:44:49,661 --> 00:44:53,895
Rym: So this is now going to be a continuing series until we finish every Monday.

707
00:44:53,996 --> 00:44:59,080
Rym: until we complete this series We are going to go through all the steps and all the components of building a computer.

708
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:05,960
Scott: You know, I'm actually kind of pleased because you know, we kind of shied away from the tech science because it was informative on Monday.

709
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:08,140
Scott: But I think we we did pretty good with informative.

710
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:13,759
Rym: I think it helps that we did informative that we're also knowledgeable about Mmm, that's excited to teach people about.

711
00:45:13,819 --> 00:45:19,850
Rym: yeah I mean you heard me floundering earlier when I was trying to explain that Biology article because as much as I love that stuff.

712
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,080
Rym: I'm not well versed in the hard sciences anymore.

713
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:28,080
Scott: Yeah, I had that great, you know fifth grade bio description of how a virus works.

714
00:45:28,341 --> 00:45:32,040
Rym: Yeah, I have the slightly better like AP biology from high school.

715
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:43,204
Scott: I took honors biology in high school but it was mostly molecular biology and it wasn't so much the viruses and the bacteria as it was the DNAs and the Anatomies and things.

716
00:45:43,465 --> 00:45:46,638
Rym: I bred fruit flies until they had mutations and then I cataloged them.

717
00:45:47,702 --> 00:45:50,090
Scott: Yeah, we know what did.

718
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:56,899
Rym: some flies all look the same and I didn't find shit awesome Totally awesome.

719
00:45:57,945 --> 00:46:11,030
Rym: All right, we out And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.
