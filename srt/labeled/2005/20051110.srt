1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,730
Scott: It's Thursday, November 10th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,160
Scott: Tonight, we'll be talking about awesome webcomics!

3
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:15,995
Rym: Dun dun dun!

4
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:20,600
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:21,449
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,294 --> 00:00:22,530
Rym: Okay.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,162
Scott: So, I get on the train to go home today, right?

8
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:26,604
Rym: Yeah.

9
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:36,270
Scott: And there's always these two guys, I sometimes pass them, and they have like a little tiny wooden chess portable thingy, and they kind of put it on their laps, and they sit in the seats facing each other, and they play chess.

10
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,092
Rym: Is it magnetic?

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:38,817
Scott: I don't know, it could be.

12
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,164
Scott: If it is, it's like, secretly magnetic.

13
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,090
Scott: But they keep it balanced pretty well.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,476
Scott: It's not an unstable set.

15
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,244
Rym: Yeah, it's not that bad of a train, so.

16
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:47,530
Scott: But anyway, that's not the point.

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,910
Scott: The point is, is that when I got on the train today, I sat in the little thing across from them.

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:52,972
Scott: You know.

19
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:53,515
Scott: Uh-huh.

20
00:00:54,179 --> 00:01:00,210
Scott: And I heard one guy talking, and he was talking, I think, I didn't hear the whole thing, about the the pick-three lottery.

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,171
Scott: So, where you pick three numbers, and then you win a prize.

22
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:05,814
Rym: Yeah.

23
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:17,106
Scott: And he was saying, "If one day, it's like 3-5-4, and the next day, it's like 3-5-6, and the next day, it's 3-5-8, what are the odds?

24
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:17,932
Scott: it's gonna be 3-5-9 on the fourth

25
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:18,012
Scott: day?".

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,460
Scott: It's, it, I'm like, I'm just sitting there like, the same, one out of 999.

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,205
Scott: The same it is every single day.

28
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:30,131
Scott: It doesn't, oh my god.

29
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:31,394
Scott: Oh my god.

30
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,340
Scott: Someone needs to take a statistics class.

31
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:34,204
Scott: Oh my god.

32
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:37,740
Rym: So, your story is basically that a lot of people are real bad at statistics.

33
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,888
Rym: That's the reason the lottery exists.

34
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,580
Scott: We need to fix, oh my god.

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,940
Scott: You should be sent immediately back to elementary school, if anyone hears you saying those sorts of things in public.

36
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,884
Rym: Here's the problem with that.

37
00:01:50,346 --> 00:01:58,140
Rym: If people all knew statistics, there wouldn't be any more lottery, and then there wouldn't be any more money for schools, because we all pay for our schools through the lottery taxes.

38
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:05,191
Scott: Well, you know, with all these people that we'd send back to school, because they were too dumb, and they, you know, join the lottery, or play the lottery.

39
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:06,840
Rym: So the schools would need even more money.

40
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:13,500
Scott: Well, no, they would get the money from all these dumb people who had to go there, because they would go there, and it would suck for them, and they would put money into it.

41
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,048
Rym: What do you mean they would put money into it?

42
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:15,571
Rym: They wouldn't.

43
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,120
Rym: They'd coast through, and then they'd leave.

44
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:17,982
Scott: How about this?

45
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:21,796
Scott: If we make an enlightened despotism, we have a lottery.

46
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,020
Scott: And there's a law.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,300
Scott: If you ever buy a lottery ticket, you are sentenced to school that you must pay for, double price.

48
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:29,839
Rym: Uh-huh.

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,460
Scott: So that way you have to pay for your own re-schooling, as well as the schooling of someone else, for being dumb.

50
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,480
Rym: Or, you know, we could just reform the public school system, so these things don't happen anymore.

51
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,727
Scott: But what about the people who are already dumb?

52
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,373
Scott: Like this guy.

53
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:52,779
Scott: I mean, he seemed like a smart guy, you know, he's playing chess, and all the other things he was saying, he seemed like a cool, happening kind of guy, except he just didn't understand statistics.

54
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,679
Rym: Well, why didn't you do your part and fix that right then?

55
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:59,280
Scott: Because I was busy playing with my new digital camera.

56
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,560
Rym: So Sony's been doing some good, but I don't know if it outweighed the bad.

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,140
Scott: Wait, wait, hasn't Sony been doing just all bad lately?

58
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,727
Rym: No, they did one good, they did one good.

59
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:12,040
Rym: They joined this Linux alliance with IBM.

60
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,300
Scott: Wait, wait, every Linux alliance so far has been poop.

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,366
Rym: Well, let's see, this is IBM, Sony, and Philips.

62
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:23,840
Rym: It's a Linux adoption group, and they're trying to get people to use Linux.

63
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:25,122
Scott: Huh.

64
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:28,700
Scott: Oh yeah, those are three companies that don't like Microsoft.

65
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,320
Rym: It's mostly a legal protection racket, as in, don't worry, we vouch for the stuff being legal so you won't get sued.

66
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:36,556
Rym: You can use OSS.

67
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,320
Scott: That's like IBM saying, don't worry, we've already won the SEO case, give us your money and we'll give you nothing.

68
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,102
Rym: You know what?

69
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,800
Rym: IBM's already won the SEO case, as far as I'm concerned.

70
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:55,800
Scott: That's the point, but they're, you know, because the SEO, that's probably why IBM's keeping the SEO case not done yet, is so that they can get money out of people and basically sell them nothing.

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,620
Rym: But we don't need to give them money, this group just is vouching for Linux, basically.

72
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,659
Scott: They'll do it whether you give them money or not?

73
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:08,240
Rym: As best I can tell, it's one of those vague industry initiatives that doesn't actually do anything.

74
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:14,120
Scott: And so it's just an excuse to make a press release with the words Linux, IBM, Sony, and Philips in it.

75
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,837
Rym: Something like that.

76
00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:15,859
Scott: Oh, okay.

77
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:33,640
Rym: Because it didn't really take away from the fact that not only did Sony release a horrible rootkit, not only does it also infect Macs, not only do if you call them to get the uninstaller, does the uninstaller install an even worse one, but someone has already exploited this thing in the wild and there's now a Trojan.

78
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,880
Scott: Well, they exploited it to cheat at World of Warcraft.

79
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:38,778
Rym: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

80
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:46,640
Scott: I can't really blame you for avoiding the grind and beating the Chinese gold farmers.

81
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:48,217
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

82
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,559
Rym: I wonder how many people are going to be selling some level 60 characters on eBay right now.

83
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,720
Scott: I heard that the next Diablo is going to be an MMO, wait till we see what goes on there.

84
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,580
Rym: Oh god, remember Battle.net?

85
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:58,227
Scott: Yeah.

86
00:04:58,901 --> 00:04:59,500
Rym: Oh my god.

87
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Scott: It's actually still Battle.net is what they call all the Blizzard online stuff.

88
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,439
Rym: I thought it'd be really cool and I logged on.

89
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:07,180
Rym: It's kind of like Steam of Blizzard.

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,960
Rym: And the guy had every item in the game and I asked him if I could have some and he gave me every item in the game.

91
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,139
Rym: And then I realized that I could just make copies of every item in the game and I'd never play it again.

92
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:19,060
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

93
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,840
Rym: But this Trojan, it's kind of cool because it preys on the vanity of idiots.

94
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:32,820
Rym: It comes as an email attachment in an email that says, "We're some sports magazine" or "We're some business magazine and we want to use your picture.

95
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,732
Rym: So could you please confirm that this is a picture of

96
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:34,873
Rym: you?".

97
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:36,439
Scott: Oh great.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,100
Scott: Yeah.

99
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,598
Scott: They open the attachment and then BAM!

100
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,472
Rym: BAM!

101
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,260
Rym: Uh, dollar sis dollars files all over your system.

102
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:45,579
Scott: Ah, that's how it goes, eh?

103
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,139
Scott: Yeah.

104
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:49,240
Rym: It doesn't use the Trojan that's already installed.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,700
Rym: They must have bought the CD, gotten the Trojan out of it, and now they're using it in their own malware.

106
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:55,488
Scott: Ugh.

107
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,280
Scott: See the thing is, Sony didn't make the Trojan.

108
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,180
Scott: They just kind of bought it from this British company.

109
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,500
Scott: Yeah, I wonder, I mean- The Mac one is actually a different one that they also bought and they put them both on all the CDs.

110
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:07,299
Rym: Who thought this was a good idea?

111
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,358
Scott: Some company that was making DRM.

112
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:15,520
Rym: No, I mean, who in Sony thought it was a good idea to poison the only legitimate paying customers they had?

113
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,260
Scott: Well, the thing is, they didn't, they didn't, I don't think they knew.

114
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,591
Scott: I think they were just saying, "Hey, let's buy DRM.

115
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:22,018
Scott: Let's look at the DRM

116
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:22,420
Scott: solutions.".

117
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,356
Scott: And this company came to them and said, "Our DRM is pretty much

118
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:26,020
Scott: unbeatable.".

119
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:26,533
Scott: And Sony said,

120
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:26,779
Scott: "Okay.".

121
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:29,460
Rym: Yeah, they probably didn't look at it too hard.

122
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,440
Scott: And probably, even if they looked at it too hard, do you think they know what they're looking at?

123
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:38,400
Scott: You think anyone at Sony that was looking at this is as competent as we are?

124
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,200
Rym: Someone at Sony has to know how to code.

125
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,797
Rym: Someone at Sony had to have said, "Hey, hey, this is a bad

126
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:43,079
Rym: idea.".

127
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:57,400
Scott: Even so, this thing has been in the wild for like months and months and months, and no one found it until very recently when the rootkit revealer guy, the guy who makes rootkit revealer, the expert on rootkits found it randomly.

128
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,897
Rym: You know why I think that was?

129
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:03,720
Rym: No one who knows about computers buys CDs anymore.

130
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,637
Scott: Could be.

131
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,520
Rym: So, no, anyone who bought, I mean, the list of CDs includes such wonderful hits as Ricky Martin.

132
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:12,597
Scott: Who's that?

133
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:14,560
Rym: Livin' La Vida Loca.

134
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:15,579
Scott: What's that?

135
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,880
Rym: Wow, you're more divorced from pop culture than I am.

136
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,838
Rym: I didn't think that could be.

137
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:22,759
Scott: I have no idea what you're talking about.

138
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,499
Rym: Hot, hot, hot or cold?

139
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,800
Scott: It's hot, hot, hot.

140
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:28,479
Scott: That was from SNL, wasn't it?

141
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,540
Rym: Yeah, that was a spoof on Ricky Martin.

142
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:32,698
Scott: Oh, alrighty then.

143
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:33,211
Rym: Yeah.

144
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,118
Scott: Okay.

145
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,545
Rym: Mr.

146
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:35,300
Rym: Pop Culture there.

147
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:35,940
Scott: Alright.

148
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,529
Scott: I just thought it was funny because the guy said, "Hot, hot,

149
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:38,710
Scott: hot.".

150
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:41,880
Scott: I didn't know they were making fun of anybody.

151
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:42,623
Rym: Wow.

152
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:53,557
Scott: So, you know that video game law in Michigan that was like, "Oh, if you sell, you know, bad video games, we'll fine you and stuff, and maybe even send you to

153
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:53,879
Scott: prison.".

154
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:56,500
Rym: Yeah, the law that made me kind of ashamed of my home state.

155
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,778
Scott: So, some judge came around and said, "Hey, I think there'd be some chilling effects up

156
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:02,099
Scott: there.".

157
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,383
Scott: Ooh.

158
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:05,239
Scott: And, uh, put a stop to that.

159
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,816
Scott: He didn't get rid of the law, but he said, "We can't be enforcing this law yet until we see some court

160
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:11,479
Scott: lookings.".

161
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:17,260
Rym: So, uh, he basically isn't letting the law get passed until they come up with a way to get rid of the law.

162
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,978
Scott: Well, it's passed, but he basically said this law can't be enforced, and it's kind of like a hold.

163
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,500
Scott: Like, you put someone on hold on the phone.

164
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,404
Rym: Huh.

165
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,080
Rym: I wonder if he's just gonna hang up when no one's looking.

166
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:30,199
Scott: You know what?

167
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:30,820
Scott: I got a theory.

168
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:31,477
Rym: Yeah?

169
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:32,780
Scott: I think this judge is a gamer.

170
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,539
Rym: You know, I wouldn't put it that far out.

171
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:45,620
Rym: We're getting to the point where the first gamers, I mean the real gamers, the hardcore gamers, are in industries and are, uh, doing things other than gaming.

172
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:47,639
Rym: Yep.

173
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,240
Rym: You know, there's gonna be a day someday when someone from the Nintendo generation is president of the United States of America.

174
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:14,060
Scott: There has to be, because you can only be president for eight years, and, uh, you know, eventually someone who was born between, you know, 1980 and 1990 will, uh, will be up for election, and your choice will be between Nintendo Player and Nintendo Player.

175
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:15,520
Rym: Ah, maybe Sega Kid.

176
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,720
Scott: No, who had a Sega Master System.

177
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,060
Scott: He'd have to be, like, a Brazilian import, because that's what they had the Sega Master System.

178
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:30,660
Rym: Man, I remember when I was in parochial school way, way back when I was a little kid, and everyone had a Nintendo, but all the dumb kids had Sagas.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,458
Scott: I don't know.

180
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,999
Scott: In my town it wasn't that way.

181
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,939
Rym: I mean, one kid had a Nintendo jacket, and he was the coolest kid.

182
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,580
Scott: Where'd he get a Nintendo jacket from in those days?

183
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,518
Rym: I think his mom made it.

184
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,777
Scott: Oh, okay, that's all right.

185
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:49,899
Scott: But in the 8-bit era, everyone had NES, and some cool kids had Ataris, but they also had NESes.

186
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,594
Rym: Yep, yep.

187
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,589
Scott: I had an Atari 2600, but it broke.

188
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,600
Rym: I had an Atari 7800, and I had an Intellivision 2 that my grandma bought.

189
00:09:56,901 --> 00:10:05,198
Scott: Oh, but, you know, after the NES, it was either SNES or Genesis, because no one could afford both of them, and, you know, no one was smart enough to hook up both to the TV.

190
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,100
Scott: So, you know, some kids bought SNES, and some kids bought Genesis, and, you know, there were some kids, you know, they would fight.

191
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,370
Scott: They'd be like, "Oh, this one's better.

192
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:13,734
Scott: This one's

193
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:14,037
Scott: better.".

194
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:17,320
Scott: But everyone played both of them pretty much equally.

195
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,220
Rym: See, I didn't know anyone who had a Genesis, and I didn't know anyone who knew anyone who had a Genesis.

196
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,858
Rym: The kids who had Genesises were kids on the other side of the school that none of us ever talked to.

197
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:26,295
Rym: Yeah.

198
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,880
Scott: We would, you know, you'd see if you had a bunch of friends with SNESes, you would usually buy a Genesis.

199
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,998
Scott: That way, you could get more games going on.

200
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,416
Rym: Yeah, but we had enough with the NES.

201
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,460
Scott: Sometimes the logic was different.

202
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:49,200
Scott: Sometimes the logic was if your friends have SNES, your close friends have SNESes, the ones you trust, you get the same, so you could trade games, and the semi-distant friends, you would get different, so that you could play the other games at parties.

203
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,560
Rym: You know, one time, I traded Hydlide for Mega Man 3.

204
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,180
Scott: You just ripped someone off real bad.

205
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,072
Rym: Yeah, he came to my door, like, 15 minutes later, and I want my game back!

206
00:11:01,616 --> 00:11:02,300
Rym: Give it back!

207
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,815
Rym: And I wouldn't open the door, and I kept it.

208
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:12,999
Scott: Yeah, one time, I traded this kid, Prince of Persia, for the Sega Genesis for, I think, Urban Strike, the helicopter game.

209
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:19,900
Scott: You know, and Prince of Persia was on a bunch of different systems, so I didn't really care, but we were supposed to trade back.

210
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,816
Scott: I never saw that kid again.

211
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:24,440
Scott: You know, I didn't beat Urban Strike.

212
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:25,780
Rym: Wasn't that good a game?

213
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:30,747
Scott: No, but I think I also got an NHL game out of the deal, but who needed that?

214
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:33,420
Scott: It wasn't as good as ice hockey or anything else.

215
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,058
Rym: Blades of Steel.

216
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,100
Scott: And then we eventually got NHL 99 for the N64, which is really good.

217
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:42,198
Rym: We had that for the PC.

218
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:46,219
Rym: Barely ran on our computer, oh my god.

219
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,669
Scott: I had the demo for the PC.

220
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,780
Scott: It ran on my Pentium 3450.

221
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,018
Scott: See, everyone always says, "Oh, put on your tinfoil

222
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:55,339
Scott: hat!".

223
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,259
Rym: Wrap tinfoil around your house.

224
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,759
Scott: Yeah, it'll prevent the government from spying on you and the radio signals getting in and out and blah.

225
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,503
Rym: Too bad.

226
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,440
Rym: it'll actually, uh, what, magnify?

227
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:19,600
Scott: Yeah, they tested some tinfoil hats, and they sent some, you know, I think 2.4 gigahertz frequency signals at you, and apparently the tinfoil hat increased the signals and did not protect you at all.

228
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,600
Rym: Outstanding.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,333
Scott: I think you would actually need, like, a real Faraday cage helmet to, uh...

230
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:29,500
Rym: But a Faraday cage has to be a complete sphere.

231
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,060
Scott: Yeah, so if it comes in through your neck, you're not doing too well.

232
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,319
Rym: Yeah.

233
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,200
Rym: I guess you just roll around in a ball like in American Gladiators for the rest of your life.

234
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,179
Scott: Dude, that'd be freaking sweet.

235
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:44,180
Rym: I wonder if we could make a market for those.

236
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,400
Rym: We could sell them to those consumers.

237
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,540
Scott: I wonder what happens if the American Gladiators set.

238
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,740
Scott: It should totally be on eBay.

239
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:53,220
Scott: I would buy the freaking, uh, the one where they shoot the tennis balls.

240
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:55,199
Scott: I would buy all the equipment from that.

241
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,939
Rym: You know what, I would play that every day.

242
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,378
Scott: I screw paintball and airsoft.

243
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,240
Rym: You know what, I get to be the guy in the tower.

244
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:04,100
Scott: No, I think we have to take turns.

245
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:07,000
Rym: No, I think I always get to be the guy in the tower.

246
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:09,840
Scott: All right, that's fine.

247
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,500
Scott: 'Cause you know what, every time I watch that show, the guy who was on the ground, you knew he could win so easily.

248
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,120
Scott: He was just always dumb when he lost.

249
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,340
Rym: Yeah, like, he'd always, like, he'd miss with every gun until he got right up to the end.

250
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:22,879
Rym: You have to throw the tennis balls at it.

251
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:25,100
Scott: And he would actually throw all three tennis balls.

252
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,780
Scott: I'd be like, you're not gonna win with the tennis balls.

253
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,819
Scott: Just run for the exit.

254
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,838
Scott: You'll get some points.

255
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,740
Scott: And the thing is, they had the one weapon, the rocket, with the little guard bit.

256
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:35,460
Scott: That rocket can hit so easily.

257
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,399
Scott: These people sucked.

258
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,519
Rym: 'Cause they were so afraid of getting hit by the ball, but the rocket had a shield on it.

259
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,200
Scott: The other thing is, one time a guy kept popping out and made the gladiator shoot all the tennis balls.

260
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,960
Scott: And then he was just like, he walked right up and shot the rocket at the target.

261
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,160
Rym: 'Cause most of the time, they got eliminated.

262
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,459
Rym: And I remember if you got eliminated, you got no points.

263
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,858
Rym: If you made it to the end, even if it took you the maximum time, you got some points.

264
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,205
Rym: Yep.

265
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,938
Scott: So you'd just make it to the end.

266
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:00,878
Rym: Yeah.

267
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,080
Rym: I would have been great on that show, except for all the other events that require speed, strength, and stamina.

268
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:09,840
Scott: You know what definitely won't protect you from those tennis balls?

269
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:11,520
Rym: Uh, tin foil hat?

270
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:11,952
Rym: Yeah.

271
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:12,478
Rym: Yeah.

272
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:12,834
Scott: Yeah.

273
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,460
Rym: Maybe we should start a market in saran wrap face masks.

274
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:18,900
Rym: That'll solve the conspiracy theory problem.

275
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,380
Scott: That'll solve the guy who don't know the statistics problem.

276
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:26,579
Rym: So it's time for the thing of the day.

277
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,119
Scott: I thought we were going to make a little music for that.

278
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,418
Rym: Well, we haven't done it yet.

279
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,699
Scott: We're so lazy.

280
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:47,640
Rym: So what is your thing of the day?

281
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:51,219
Scott: So I went onto the internet this morning and I saw--.

282
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,860
Rym: Oh, you went on the internet this morning.

283
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,340
Scott: I saw Doom running on the iPod Nano.

284
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:56,918
Rym: Now-- Wait, Doom.

285
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,840
Rym: Doom or Doom 2?

286
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,640
Scott: Doom 1.

287
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,240
Rym: Doom 1.

288
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,777
Scott: The whole thing.

289
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,180
Rym: How do you, uh, control it on the iPod Nano?

290
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,499
Scott: Well, I guess you steer left and right with the wheel.

291
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,600
Rym: And then I guess you, uh-- So how do I strafe, change weapons, shoot, and open doors?

292
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:14,060
Scott: You can't-- I don't think you can do all those things easily.

293
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:15,818
Scott: I think there's no strafing.

294
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,180
Scott: You pretty much turn left and right by going left and right.

295
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,278
Scott: And I think you, uh, go forward by pushing up.

296
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,760
Scott: You shoot by pushing the middle button.

297
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:31,280
Rym: And you open doors, I think, maybe-- You realize without being able to strafe, it's pretty much impossible to get more than two and a half levels into Doom.

298
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,340
Scott: I think you play it on, uh, you know, Don't Hurt Me.

299
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:36,219
Rym: Uh, uh.

300
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:40,780
Scott: I guess you could play it on Nightmare, but the idea isn't the cool, awesome controls.

301
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,160
Scott: The idea is that you're playing Doom on an iPod Nano.

302
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,220
Rym: So, uh, did you install it on your iPod Nano?

303
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:49,220
Scott: Well, the way it works is you have to install iPod Linux and then Doom, right?

304
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:49,938
Rym: Uh-huh.

305
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,840
Scott: Now, um, see, the directions seem pretty easy.

306
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,440
Scott: It was get this executable Windows thing, run it, and it installs Linux on your Nano.

307
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:01,280
Scott: And then just put Doom folder on your Nano.

308
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:02,980
Rym: So, uh, that didn't work?

309
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:07,100
Scott: Well, I read and I thought I read the whole thing.

310
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,720
Scott: And I mean, they had a picture of Doom running on the Nano.

311
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:16,220
Scott: And the directions on the Doom for Nano website was install iPod Linux, copy Doom.

312
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,039
Scott: So I went and I got the executable to install iPod Linux and ran it.

313
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,779
Scott: But little did I realize that the latest stable version does not support the Nano.

314
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:31,140
Scott: They must use a nightly build or done something else tricky that they didn't explain at all.

315
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:34,800
Scott: So I found out what happens when you screw up the firmware on your Nano.

316
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:35,718
Rym: It doesn't work?

317
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,338
Scott: Well, it turns on.

318
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,240
Scott: You get the little black apple that says I'm booting, right?

319
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:49,537
Scott: And then you get the, uh, this folder with an exclamation point that says www.apple.com/ipod/support.

320
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:52,460
Scott: That is awesome.

321
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,480
Scott: It tells you this URL for the support site.

322
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:57,719
Scott: So then I'm like, all right, I broke it.

323
00:16:58,162 --> 00:17:01,080
Scott: I'll just use the iPod updater to restore the firmware.

324
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:08,999
Scott: Apparently, because the firmware was somewhat borked that I had put on there, it wasn't so easy to replace it.

325
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:22,878
Scott: I eventually had to like restart the computer, restart the iPod service, run the updater, then plug in the iPod, then wait as the computer went crazy, then click the restore button, then wait as it went crazy again.

326
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,913
Rym: So, uh, did you figure this out on your own?

327
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:29,220
Rym: or was there some forum somewhere where someone said I borked my iPod?

328
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,580
Scott: No, I had to figure it out.

329
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:31,540
Scott: I knew to restore.

330
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,780
Scott: That was obvious because he just restores to the real Apple firmware.

331
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:35,956
Rym: Restore didn't work.

332
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,240
Scott: Restore didn't work like five times.

333
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:39,699
Scott: I just had to keep messing with it.

334
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:42,460
Scott: And if that didn't work, I would have had to go to the Apple store.

335
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:44,719
Rym: Don't you do a work at work?

336
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,059
Scott: This was during my little breaky bit.

337
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:48,558
Rym: Yeah, your breaky bit.

338
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,311
Scott: Yeah.

339
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,199
Rym: Oh, well.

340
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,759
Rym: My thing of the day, usually I'm not one to say this, is so much cooler than your thing of the day.

341
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,900
Scott: What could be cooler than doom on a music player?

342
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,440
Rym: This is one of the coolest things I've seen on the internet in a long time.

343
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,438
Scott: Can't be that cool.

344
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:08,338
Rym: So, uh, humans haven't made anything like the great pyramids in a long time.

345
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:10,160
Scott: Ever.

346
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:11,373
Rym: Yeah.

347
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,339
Rym: Well, you're saying aliens made the great pyramids?

348
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,619
Scott: No, I guess, but not, you know what I mean?

349
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,187
Rym: Yeah.

350
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,540
Rym: We have not really undertaken such massive, uh, works.

351
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,598
Scott: Well, we made Rome.

352
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:28,520
Rym: Rome wasn't really a large semi-useless thing to convey information.

353
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:30,580
Rym: It was more of a city full of people.

354
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:33,120
Scott: We made, uh, big buildings.

355
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,097
Rym: Yeah.

356
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:36,080
Rym: But anyway.

357
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,540
Rym: Rockets.

358
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:56,520
Rym: Consider how would we, as a civilization, convey culturally independent information that can be understood and experienced by possibly unknown or primitive cultures five, ten, fifteen thousand years from now, and why would we want to?

359
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,920
Scott: Well, I don't know why we'd want to, but we could use HD Rosetta.

360
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:02,820
Rym: Yeah, but we're talking about technologically primitive.

361
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,159
Rym: Possibly.

362
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,940
Scott: We could make a box that has some audio recorded and a speaker and- Audio!

363
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:10,447
Rym: Audio!

364
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,300
Rym: Because they'll speak the same language as ten thousand years from now.

365
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,400
Scott: Who says it has to be language?

366
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,219
Scott: It could just be noises.

367
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,060
Rym: All right, so we have a moo, and then a bark, and then some noise.

368
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,257
Scott: You know those things where you turn it upside down and it goes "meh"?

369
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,940
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure that'll convey the, uh, gestalt of our civilization.

370
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:32,600
Scott: How about, you know, a self-powered video player where, you know, if anyone comes near it, it plays video?

371
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:38,900
Rym: Self-powered that'll somehow not be taken apart and sold for scrap sometime during those ten or twenty thousand years.

372
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,720
Scott: Well, hide it with like a projector.

373
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:41,560
Rym: All right, all right.

374
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,919
Rym: So anyway, back to the other point you made of why would we want to.

375
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,880
Rym: Well, uh, say we start using nuclear power more than we do now, and we start generating a lot of nuclear waste.

376
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,528
Scott: All right.

377
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:59,060
Rym: So we're gonna have to start building deep underground storage facilities to contain it.

378
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:01,099
Scott: Well, you already determined that that would be perfectly safe.

379
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:09,539
Rym: Yeah, unless someone drills there, or digs it up, or starts like tapping into the well water that goes right through it.

380
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,059
Scott: Yeah, that would be bad.

381
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:17,720
Rym: So this is an actual study, and there's a lot more to this document than I have in my link today,

382
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:18,443
Scott: but

383
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:29,640
Rym: basically it's a bunch of scientists and researchers talking about how can you convey universally to intelligent beings that there is something bad here that you don't want to unearth.

384
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:47,399
Rym: Like think about in the movies where there, or in D&D, when there's a demon that some ancient civilization buried somewhere, and they put up like the crazy warnings and the spell barriers and all the stuff to keep you out and to warn you that something's bad's here, until the main character of a movie wanders in and accidentally releases it.

385
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,600
Scott: It's so obvious, you just put some traps and you put some things that are ominous.

386
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:53,639
Rym: No, because traps don't work.

387
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,900
Rym: Traps tell people there's something valuable here.

388
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:59,278
Rym: I'm going to bypass the traps and try to get to it.

389
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:01,080
Rym: And traps don't work forever.

390
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,080
Scott: You put things that are all too enticing.

391
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:12,619
Rym: See, actually the conclusions, I mean this paper is really interesting, and I can't really get into all the details without making a whole podcast about it.

392
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:15,260
Rym: So you're really gonna have to follow this link because it's really neat.

393
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:38,479
Rym: But basically they talk about how you could do this, how you could make this gestalt, this system of information that as a whole will let people know that this is a bad place and you don't want to be here, while at the same time propagating itself and being resistant to people, say scavenging it for spare parts or masonry, or making a monument to it because they think it's something like the pyramids.

394
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:47,100
Rym: And it talks about different things, like they break up the types of different information you can convey to people into four levels.

395
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:50,699
Rym: Level one is there is something man-made here.

396
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,840
Rym: Probably the simplest message in the world.

397
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,639
Rym: What is here is not natural.

398
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,660
Rym: Level two is whatever is here is dangerous.

399
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:02,140
Rym: It was repulsive to us as a society and you do not want it.

400
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,819
Rym: There is no item of value here.

401
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,179
Rym: This is a non-place.

402
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:06,780
Scott: A non-place?

403
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,620
Rym: A non-place.

404
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,038
Rym: A place that you should not be.

405
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:11,480
Scott: It's not a place.

406
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:23,499
Rym: Level three should be an explanation in some sort of language, probably whatever language is most common, maybe multiple languages, that would hopefully be translated by people in the future, that explains exactly what it is.

407
00:22:24,021 --> 00:22:26,060
Rym: This is a horrible nuclear waste burial site.

408
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:28,900
Rym: It was built in the year blah blah blah.

409
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:29,678
Rym: It is this big.

410
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,280
Rym: Whatever.

411
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:39,279
Rym: Level four information is here are the schematics and technical diagrams of all the crap we buried under here and exactly how dangerous it is and when we think it won't be dangerous anymore.

412
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:46,980
Rym: And to skip a bit, because I could talk about this forever, I read the whole thing and it's really cool.

413
00:22:47,682 --> 00:23:00,420
Rym: They came up with a lot of ideas on how to convey these messages and the basic concept is that in addition to having bits of information around, they want the area to be inhabitable and ominous.

414
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:14,594
Rym: So these architects came up with ways to have like horrible non-euclidean looking jagged spikes coming out of the ground made of like basalt or horrible Cthulhu looking cities that just make you feel bad.

415
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,058
Rym: Like something's bad here and I shouldn't be here.

416
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:18,919
Rym: These are like things out of movies.

417
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,519
Scott: See but that makes people feel bad.

418
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,299
Scott: How do we know that some aliens won't feel good?

419
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,600
Scott: Like hey look this is the obviously the only inhabitable part of this damn planet.

420
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:37,595
Rym: Well actually they get into that because they show such things as you can't just have a big warning that says warning radiation because a civilization might be standing there and to whip out a Geiger counter and hey there's no radiation.

421
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:38,300
Rym: that signs BS.

422
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:40,900
Rym: They don't know that the radiation is buried very deep.

423
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:46,578
Rym: and then five thousand years later they dig down to get something and the horrible radiation comes out.

424
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:51,553
Rym: So they tried to come up with universal ideas of.

425
00:23:52,216 --> 00:23:53,340
Rym: this is a dangerous place.

426
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,098
Rym: Menacing earthworks.

427
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:59,400
Rym: Not using like obelisks or pyramids or anything that looks good.

428
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,100
Rym: They want things to be pretty but not good looking.

429
00:24:03,481 --> 00:24:06,000
Rym: They want to convey the message that this is something repulsive.

430
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:16,558
Rym: And yeah I really shouldn't talk more about it because other than there's a funny picture of a guy getting radiation on him and then falling over dying and there's happy trees next to him.

431
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,980
Scott: Why don't they just put some poison gas there like.

432
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,980
Rym: See that's one of the one of the things they said is that you can't keep people out because we can guarantee like the pyramids.

433
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,768
Rym: The pyramids were designed to keep people out.

434
00:24:29,412 --> 00:24:30,620
Rym: then technology improved.

435
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,820
Rym: People found the pyramids and they broke themselves in and saw what was out.

436
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:38,859
Rym: Just put something that smells bad that'll last ten thousand years.

437
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,459
Rym: Yeah yeah because we have that technology.

438
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:47,040
Rym: Unless we got to get working on what we made a giant pyramid of dead dogs and skunks.

439
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,099
Scott: I'll tell you what if we did that it'd be a lot cooler than this story.

440
00:24:51,661 --> 00:25:05,120
Rym: Really read the article because the pictures are neat the conclusions they make are neat and this is probably one of the most forward thinking projects I've ever seen mankind in recent history engage upon.

441
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,300
Scott: It's neat and it's forward thinking but I don't think it's that cool.

442
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:10,598
Rym: If you read this article I think you'll think it is.

443
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,145
Rym: Yeah.

444
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,879
Rym: This is the closest to a real yeah we're ever gonna get.

445
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,862
Scott: But you know what's good about these kind of things is like when you run out of stuff to talk about.

446
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:23,158
Scott: that's the kind of stuff you could just keep talking about for like hours if you're a bunch of nerds.

447
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,099
Rym: Yeah like when we debate the various uh ways magic works in Dungeons and Dragons games.

448
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:31,919
Scott: No it's nothing like that.

449
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,780
Rym: Yeah because that's what Pete and Katsu and I were doing not too long ago mostly Pete and Katsu.

450
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:37,891
Scott: Good job.

451
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,249
Rym: So web comics.

452
00:25:45,391 --> 00:25:46,749
Scott: Oh yeah read them every day.

453
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,870
Rym: Yeah every morning I get up and I read about 12 different web comics.

454
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:53,730
Scott: I read like seven because I have standards too high.

455
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:59,749
Rym: Well also because a lot of web comics we used to read have fallen by the wayside because their authors stopped updating them.

456
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:04,750
Scott: And a lot of them we used to read are not funny and it just took so long to finally delete the bookmark.

457
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,690
Rym: See I'm sorry but Bob and George was never funny.

458
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,430
Scott: It was funny.

459
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:08,770
Rym: It was never funny.

460
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,190
Scott: It was Flash Man and the joke was that he flashed people.

461
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,090
Scott: He had a trench coat.

462
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:13,829
Scott: It was funny.

463
00:26:14,854 --> 00:26:15,889
Rym: That wasn't funny at all.

464
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:16,829
Scott: That was funny.

465
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,690
Rym: That was perhaps one of the lamest jokes I've ever heard in my life.

466
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:20,407
Scott: I like it.

467
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:24,130
Rym: That speaks very highly of your character and sense of humor.

468
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:25,010
Scott: I like flashing.

469
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:26,321
Rym: Flash.

470
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:27,587
Rym: Oh god.

471
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:34,180
Scott: So you know over time we've you know added and removed a whole lot of web comics.

472
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:43,079
Rym: Yep one web comic we read for a long time and then the author stopped writing it and disappeared and then he reappeared and asked for money and he said if you got enough money you'd start the comic again.

473
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:46,720
Rym: So we both gave him money and he wrote three more strips and then he disappeared again.

474
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,660
Scott: You know I was thinking about the exact same comic like two seconds ago.

475
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,697
Rym: Yeah so uh Nick Yu of Bad Boys of Computer Science if you're listening I want my five dollars back.

476
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:57,731
Scott: Not only don't I want my one dollar back that I gave you.

477
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:02,720
Scott: and uh you know you were supposed to make a comic for that one dollar and you didn't.

478
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,080
Scott: So yeah get working.

479
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,000
Rym: So probably our favorite web comic just hands down is Penny Arcade.

480
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,280
Scott: I don't know VVOCS could have lived up if it would have kept going.

481
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,140
Scott: Yeah it could have.

482
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,640
Scott: Despite its much much much less artisticness.

483
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:27,720
Rym: But Penny Arcade is I mean this is undisputed by and large by orders of magnitude or at one order of magnitude the most read webcomic in the world.

484
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,240
Rym: It is the number one webcomic.

485
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,998
Rym: More people read it than any other webcomic.

486
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:32,979
Scott: With good reason.

487
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,740
Rym: Yeah and you know what it's probably one of my favorites.

488
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:38,658
Scott: It's my favorite webcomic.

489
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:39,940
Scott: Absolutely.

490
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,260
Rym: I mean it's very simple.

491
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:48,080
Rym: The humor is often very uh strange or violent or revolving around the use of bad words.

492
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,231
Scott: Mm-hmm.

493
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,777
Scott: The thing about Penny Arcade is that it's just the only comic of all the comics.

494
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,738
Scott: every single one of them is funny.

495
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,124
Scott: Every single.

496
00:27:58,164 --> 00:27:59,560
Scott: there isn't one that is unfunny.

497
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,398
Scott: Some are better than others.

498
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:01,698
Scott: Not gonna deny that.

499
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,960
Scott: And some you know are about something that you care about more or a game you care about less or something you're in touch with more.

500
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,840
Rym: They're often multiple layers to the jokes.

501
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,960
Rym: Like there'll be a joke about or there's one with a snowman.

502
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,098
Rym: There's a joke about something some video game The Sims that if you don't play video games you wouldn't get.

503
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,973
Rym: But there was also a very obvious blatant look.

504
00:28:19,993 --> 00:28:21,480
Rym: he put a penis on the snowman joke.

505
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,543
Rym: It's scary.

506
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:27,320
Rym: that I mean as we both started reading this along with all of our friends right about as we were freshmen in college.

507
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,779
Scott: You mean when the comic was pretty almost brand new.

508
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,249
Rym: Yeah.

509
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,880
Scott: I think it was maybe six months to a year old at that point.

510
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:40,239
Rym: And I can think back to a Penny Arcade comic and I can correlate it with a period in my college life.

511
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,652
Scott: It's hard to match the times of exactly like.

512
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:44,760
Scott: sometimes you look and you're like that comic so recent.

513
00:28:45,282 --> 00:28:46,760
Scott: Oh my God it's two years old.

514
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,816
Scott: Oh my God.

515
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,759
Rym: But some are like they're making fun of tribes too.

516
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,759
Rym: We bought that when it came out.

517
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:57,400
Scott: Oh and I remember playing it and I remember it was the best game ever.

518
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,019
Scott: And that comic is so right.

519
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:02,319
Scott: All their comics are so right.

520
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,180
Scott: One thing about Penny Arcade comics is that it was like a newspaper comic right.

521
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,040
Scott: It's like they have like an introduction at the beginning.

522
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,580
Scott: Then there's like a setup and then there's a punch line.

523
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:16,100
Scott: A Penny Arcade comic like doesn't have a beginning or an end.

524
00:29:16,202 --> 00:29:16,919
Scott: It's just the middle.

525
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:26,520
Scott: You know like you'll see like violence about to happen in the final frame or like you'll see constant violence throughout the three frames.

526
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,739
Scott: And there'll be a joke in each one.

527
00:29:30,662 --> 00:29:32,439
Scott: So like it'll be like joke joke joke.

528
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,039
Scott: But the third one somehow also includes the first two.

529
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,360
Scott: So it's like instead of say something normal say something normal.

530
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,220
Scott: Something funny because of the first two things.

531
00:29:45,462 --> 00:29:49,760
Scott: It's two funny things and then a third thing that incorporates the first two things.

532
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,380
Rym: It's like each frame stands on its own as a joke.

533
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,279
Rym: But the three of them together are greater than the sum of the three.

534
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,720
Scott: Yeah and even and most of the time you'll see that the thing they say in the third frame.

535
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,139
Scott: The joke is actually in the non-existent fourth frame.

536
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:06,540
Scott: Or somehow in the non-existent first frame.

537
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,819
Scott: Like you'll see Gabe come walking in with something stupid that already happened to him.

538
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,399
Scott: You know like he'll already be chewed up by a dog and it's like what happened to you.

539
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,577
Rym: Yep or also you can't forget the ones where they show the end of the joke.

540
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:23,900
Rym: and then the last frame is like Gabe and Tycho staring at each other in an awkward moment.

541
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,360
Scott: Yeah when the facial expressions especially on Gabe whenever something funny happens.

542
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,939
Rym: There's the one when the hobo spiders came out.

543
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,060
Scott: The hobo spider and he had a spider in his mouth and one in his eye.

544
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,640
Scott: And the way his mouth was just this oval.

545
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:39,840
Scott: It's just this oval like he drew it.

546
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:51,640
Scott: I don't know he probably drew it with his hand but yeah it looked like it was a perfect oval drawn in illustrator with two rows of like flat teeth in this tongue and it was like it was covered in spiders.

547
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:53,498
Scott: Just looking at it.

548
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,059
Scott: Just cut the face out and put it somewhere with no text.

549
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:05,599
Rym: Now the other one that we started reading at right about the same time which used to be the most popular web comic in the world.

550
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:07,099
Rym: Mega Tokyo.

551
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:08,336
Scott: Oh yeah.

552
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:12,980
Rym: Which was absolutely hilarious back when it was a four panel comic about gaming.

553
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,839
Scott: You mean when it was Largo's comic?

554
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,100
Rym: Yeah back when Largo was still on the comics.

555
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,239
Rym: He was done by Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston.

556
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,319
Scott: Rodney Caston.

557
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:23,320
Rym: And they had a falling out and now it's just done by Fred Gallagher.

558
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,899
Scott: I think his site is like TypeRcaston.com.

559
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,640
Rym: Something like that.

560
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,999
Scott: Because he thinks he's cool with the Type R.

561
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:30,200
Rym: And I still read it and it's a good comic.

562
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,980
Rym: It's really well drawn.

563
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,500
Rym: I mean hands off to Fred for being an amazing artist.

564
00:31:34,484 --> 00:31:37,939
Scott: You know actually it's like it looks really cool.

565
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:41,339
Scott: but a lot of people I know that like it looks really cool to me.

566
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:48,820
Scott: You know he draws like pencils and like you know crazy detail as compared to like you know a lot of manga that's in pencil.

567
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,533
Scott: I mean like Death Note has better art but you know maybe you know random Tokyo Pop.

568
00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:56,618
Scott: manga number three doesn't.

569
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,289
Rym: Yeah.

570
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,620
Scott: But lots of art people I know always say bad things about it.

571
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:08,660
Scott: All the girls look the same and he doesn't do backgrounds very high quality.

572
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,840
Scott: And a lot of times like the sizes of things are all off.

573
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,220
Scott: Things you don't notice unless you're like an artist person.

574
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,179
Scott: Unless they're way way off.

575
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:19,628
Rym: I mean I still like the comic.

576
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:28,666
Rym: but the only thing that bothers me is that it's not about gaming anymore and it's kind of following this like stereotypical show Joey kind of.

577
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,019
Rym: oh girls and fanboys plot that.

578
00:32:32,962 --> 00:32:35,453
Scott: The thing that bothers me is not so much the is it.

579
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,178
Scott: Number one the plot moves slowly right.

580
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,300
Scott: It's not the worst plot in the world.

581
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:47,938
Scott: I mean in terms of itself but it is very slow and they don't fill in a lot of details.

582
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:55,660
Scott: and like if you don't know stuff like I didn't even know what was going on for the first half because they were never really character introductions or developments or anything.

583
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:56,302
Scott: You know.

584
00:32:57,906 --> 00:33:10,420
Scott: and then the other thing that bothers me is like the plot itself is okay but the message of the plot is it's okay to be a fanboy and it's very fanboy fanboys.

585
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,437
Rym: Don't be mean to them.

586
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,959
Scott: Yeah it's like it should be fanboy get off your ass and stop being a stupid fanboy shower.

587
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,200
Scott: Yeah take a shower or else girls won't go with you.

588
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,551
Scott: Girls should be all oh and liking fanboys.

589
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:31,000
Scott: and you know it's like oh just fanboy fan service of the most direct kind.

590
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,412
Rym: Now see I can always hope that he's not gonna like.

591
00:33:33,452 --> 00:33:37,775
Rym: that's the direction he's going in but then it'll kind of turn into a. oh that was wrong.

592
00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:38,660
Rym: here's how it should be.

593
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:45,840
Scott: There's no chance because he's a fanboy and he makes you know he's drawing like his own fantasy world and it's also the fantasy world of fanboys.

594
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,699
Rym: Possibly I mean I don't know him too well.

595
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:51,951
Scott: No remember he likes that canon stuff.

596
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:53,956
Scott: I mean come on come on.

597
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:55,400
Scott: it's obvious everyone knows it.

598
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:03,259
Rym: Well also the fact that we have a personal grudge with Megatokio because they stole the joke mosh mosh revolution from us.

599
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,620
Scott: I don't think he actually stole the idea.

600
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,446
Rym: Not him specifically.

601
00:34:05,506 --> 00:34:07,300
Rym: this sounds silly but this really happened.

602
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:14,900
Scott: Well we we were talking about this idea of mosh mosh revolution and some guy who thought he was all cool because he knew Fred.

603
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,040
Rym: Ken Hashimoto aka the blur.

604
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,659
Scott: The blur according to Largo who called him the blur.

605
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,060
Scott: Her overheard us you know making this random joke of mosh mosh revolution.

606
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,520
Rym: And then sure enough next week mosh mosh revolution was in Megatokio.

607
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:46,119
Scott: Yeah so I think it's pretty obvious that what happened was we were talking about it and then Ken heard it and told it to Fred maybe said it was his own idea or just told it as a joke or who even knows yeah but communicated that idea to him and then Fred turned it into a comic.

608
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:49,739
Rym: Though even still you can't deny the Megatokio phenomena.

609
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,219
Rym: Remember what the first Otakon they went to the sheer number of people trying to get into that room to get a glimpse of those two guys.

610
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,939
Scott: Because the number of people that the type people are at Otakon are the type of people read that comic.

611
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,839
Rym: Imagine if Gabe and Taiko went to Otakon.

612
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:05,637
Scott: Yeah they were gonna once and they didn't.

613
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,752
Scott: Yeah instead they went to the Baltimore Comic-Con this year where like no one went and it was all quiet.

614
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:15,960
Rym: Yeah I mean I guess two Gabe and Taiko even though you're probably not listening.

615
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:21,599
Rym: Imagine the Baltimore Comic-Con where that entire convention center is filled to the brim with geeks.

616
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,364
Scott: Every you were in just.

617
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:26,636
Scott: I think the Baltimore Comic-Con was in just one room of that convention center.

618
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:31,020
Scott: Otakon is the only thing that uses the entire convention center.

619
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:38,780
Scott: Every room in both buildings is absolutely full of geeks geeks geeks everywhere.

620
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:39,765
Rym: And that's not enough.

621
00:35:39,885 --> 00:35:43,919
Rym: they're making Baltimore build another convention center next to it to house more Otakon.

622
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:51,099
Scott: And if you had come that one year you probably would have packed the largest room in that convention center.

623
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,011
Rym: Which seats what 9,000 people?

624
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,086
Scott: Something crazy like that.

625
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:56,580
Scott: just to look at your ugly asses.

626
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:00,820
Scott: Yeah.

627
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,289
Scott: Yeah.

628
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,815
Rym: Of course to move on I don't have a segue here.

629
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:06,880
Rym: 8-bit theater.

630
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:07,799
Scott: Oh my god.

631
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:10,540
Rym: 8-bit theater when it started was really dumb.

632
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:18,400
Rym: Like the first six or seven comics were just this stupid sprite comic where a guy took pictures from Final Fantasy 1 and put speech bubbles on.

633
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:24,280
Scott: You know I was never the biggest fan of Final Fantasy and like when I was a freshman everyone was like oh I read 8-bit theater and I was like oh that's crap.

634
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,520
Rym: So I read the first few and I was like this is crap.

635
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,239
Rym: And then I came back a month later and there were a whole bunch more.

636
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:36,460
Rym: And it evolved from crap sprite comic to probably one of the funniest things I've ever read in my life shortly.

637
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:41,039
Scott: I mean I came back when like Black Mage was cutting up like people in town.

638
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,644
Scott: And it's like he.

639
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:54,080
Scott: just you know he the guy always complains or at least I've seen writing of his that says man I kind of don't like the sprite thing because I'm so limited.

640
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,285
Scott: But he stretches.

641
00:36:56,305 --> 00:37:06,360
Scott: he's the only person of all the sprite comics who actually you know does things to the sprites to like stretch out their artistic possibilities.

642
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:15,379
Scott: He throws in like pictures in the background and you know he makes things all like shiny or you know all kinds of crazy stuff.

643
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:33,140
Rym: Yeah the other thing is I don't know how he did it but he took these very inanimate sprites and gave each one of them such a unique and obvious personality that it's gotten to the point where if I play Final Fantasy 1 I see Fighter from the comic.

644
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,940
Rym: I don't see Fighter from Final Fantasy 1.

645
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,980
Rym: I don't see whatever I used to come up with when I played that game.

646
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,944
Scott: I mean I used to play.

647
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:43,323
Scott: I used to play with a freaking black belt but I can't do that now.

648
00:37:43,343 --> 00:37:47,020
Scott: you know speaking of black belt he's in today's guy.

649
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:48,077
Rym: Yeah he is.

650
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,509
Scott: The other thing though I've noticed about 8-bit theater is that it used to be where there would be like a zing in the final panel right.

651
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:58,980
Scott: ever since the vernacular zing comic there seem to be more zings per comic.

652
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,060
Rym: I like zing.

653
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:11,480
Scott: It's just he's gotten better and better at coming up with these great like one line hilarious things and he just loads every comic up with them and they're still funny even if they might be repetitive.

654
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,517
Scott: I hope that lasts.

655
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:19,359
Rym: Yep plus I went to UberCon last year and I actually had the privilege of meeting Brian Clevenger and he's a cool guy.

656
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,779
Scott: Yeah imagine he's a cool guy.

657
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,499
Scott: I've seen some stuff about him.

658
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,359
Rym: Yep I thought when I first met him like I should ask him for a sketch and I realized he does a sprite comic.

659
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,004
Scott: I don't know if he.

660
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:32,340
Scott: I don't remember if he had drawing skills or not.

661
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,318
Scott: I'm pretty sure he does.

662
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:38,859
Scott: Going to get drawing skills and then didn't because he went with the sprite comic and he's lazy.

663
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,900
Rym: You know what though I like the sprite comic.

664
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:45,259
Scott: Yeah and you need at least something that's you know different from the other stuff.

665
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,089
Rym: Now we're in real life and it's not the best comic in the world but I like it.

666
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,977
Scott: Yeah it's definitely.

667
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:55,510
Scott: uh the content matter is important.

668
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,809
Scott: The subject matter.

669
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,887
Scott: It's very geeky.

670
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:04,648
Scott: Yeah and you know the guy comes up with just a geek joke and you know but he's a really cool guy even though I never met him.

671
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,407
Scott: Yeah it's like you read the comic and you know all about this guy and that's kind of the point.

672
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,229
Scott: It's like ah he's a cool geek somewhere and now I know all his stuff.

673
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,770
Scott: Yeah and all his stuff is kind of like my stuff.

674
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:19,530
Rym: It flows a lot like a newspaper comic a good newspaper comic.

675
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:22,100
Rym: Yeah I don't know what else.

676
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,310
Rym: what else more I can say about it.

677
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:26,349
Rym: I mean it's just a generally good comic that I read every day.

678
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,728
Rym: Yeah every day it updates.

679
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:29,166
Scott: You know what it's not as good as?

680
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:29,704
Rym: Huh?

681
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,308
Scott: Boases.

682
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:32,549
Rym: Oh god Boases.

683
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,718
Scott: Boases if Penny Arcade is the number one comic.

684
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:40,669
Scott: Boases is the number two comic with with no argument at all.

685
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,441
Rym: Boases seems weird because you look at it.

686
00:39:43,521 --> 00:39:45,209
Rym: it's called boy on a stick and slither.

687
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,010
Rym: Boases.

688
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,050
Rym: A boy on a stick and a little snake.

689
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,849
Scott: I like how it comes out where it's boa snake get it?

690
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:53,710
Scott: I don't think that was intended.

691
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,287
Rym: Uh might have been you don't know.

692
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:55,968
Scott: Nah.

693
00:39:57,451 --> 00:40:02,790
Rym: It's just a very half the time it's very metaphorical and poignant and half the time it's just silly.

694
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,390
Scott: You know I think even when it's being just silly it's still trying to say something.

695
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,430
Scott: It's just trying to say something less important.

696
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,310
Rym: I gotta tell you though I would have voted for Frickles Mudcat.

697
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,316
Scott: Oh my god.

698
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:14,630
Scott: Frickles Mudcat for president.

699
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,448
Rym: Several chances.

700
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:16,988
Scott: Several chances.

701
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:22,784
Scott: You know Boases is just like instead of drawing.

702
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,390
Scott: it's totally different from every other kind.

703
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,621
Scott: He doesn't draw panels he doesn't you know.

704
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:30,870
Scott: all he does is he has the stick and the snake standing next to each other saying stuff.

705
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,488
Rym: And random surreal backgrounds and sometimes God appears he's a little uh.

706
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,530
Scott: God is a cloud with a bottle of beer and a cigarette and a lightning for a hand.

707
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,950
Scott: And whenever God appears you know that's a great comic because.

708
00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:46,050
Rym: I don't know I'm a fan of the Florida Cracker.

709
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:47,850
Scott: I don't like the Florida Cracker.

710
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,710
Rym: I don't like the Florida Cracker but I know people like the Florida Cracker.

711
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:57,149
Scott: The Florida Cracker could be more funny if he was if he used him a little differently each time instead of using him this kind of the same way.

712
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:58,134
Rym: Yeah.

713
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,650
Scott: So every time the Florida Cracker appears all he does is say Florida Cracker people are stupid.

714
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,229
Scott: Doesn't actually.

715
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,350
Rym: Of course he did the same thing with that uh hippie character that he kind of hasn't used in a while.

716
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,089
Scott: You mean Nancy the Tooth?

717
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:10,437
Scott: Yeah.

718
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,970
Scott: Nancy the Tooth is never funny.

719
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,610
Scott: That's why Nancy the Tooth doesn't appear anymore.

720
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:20,190
Rym: Though since we're moving toward the weird comics we move toward probably the weirdest comic.

721
00:41:21,572 --> 00:41:24,590
Rym: A lesson is learned but the damage is irreversible.

722
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,569
Scott: It's not the weirdest comic.

723
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:28,049
Rym: I think it's probably the weirdest comic I read.

724
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,540
Scott: Okay maybe the weirdest one you read but it's.

725
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:32,130
Scott: it's not the weirdest comic at all.

726
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,330
Scott: There's plenty of weird freaking comics out there.

727
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:44,670
Rym: It's very odd and very interestingly drawn and I never would have found it except a friend of mine who is actually also a webcomic artist pointed it to us one day.

728
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:45,254
Scott: Well they draw it.

729
00:41:45,274 --> 00:41:46,829
Scott: he draws it differently every time.

730
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,490
Rym: Yeah like every comic it updates randomly as far as I can tell.

731
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:51,990
Rym: Every comic is completely different.

732
00:41:52,730 --> 00:42:01,328
Scott: Yep it's like sometimes they'll have like this really nice painted art and then they'll have this kind of splotchy kind of thing going on that looks like it was like.

733
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:05,507
Scott: uh you know I don't know the word for it.

734
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,070
Scott: Sometimes they'll have like very few colors.

735
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,370
Scott: Sometimes it'll be crazy colors all over the place.

736
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:12,229
Scott: Sometimes we panel.

737
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:16,469
Scott: Sometimes it's just like this kind of like swooshy kind of shape going on.

738
00:42:16,651 --> 00:42:17,430
Rym: And sometimes it's funny.

739
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,410
Rym: Sometimes it's very uh metaphorical.

740
00:42:19,795 --> 00:42:20,790
Rym: Sometimes it's nothing.

741
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:26,190
Rym: Sometimes the comic will just go and then it ends and you're just left hanging with the sense of why did I read that?

742
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:26,870
Rym: Nothing happened.

743
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,068
Rym: Yeah but it was still very pretty and you still feel good about reading it.

744
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:33,170
Scott: Eh some of them I just didn't really feel anything.

745
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:33,456
Scott: I was like.

746
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:33,868
Scott: what was that?

747
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:34,427
Scott: I don't know.

748
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,709
Rym: Yeah I like it though.

749
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:44,370
Scott: Yeah it's it's not something that I. uh I check but if there's a new one it's worth the 10 seconds it takes to read the page.

750
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,930
Rym: Yeah of course there's always the Perry Bible Fellowship.

751
00:42:48,111 --> 00:42:49,723
Rym: Which is absolutely hilarious.

752
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,270
Rym: Imagine the far side only a little bit darker in terms of what it's about.

753
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,309
Scott: And like three or four panels.

754
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:58,080
Scott: Yeah.

755
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,689
Scott: But it's still always good.

756
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,110
Rym: Everyone's different and it also updates randomly but.

757
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,543
Scott: I think it updates semi-weekly.

758
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:06,610
Scott: I think was the the rule.

759
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:07,668
Scott: I have no idea.

760
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,290
Rym: His site has very little text and a lot of pictures.

761
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,590
Scott: The site's very badly designed as a site.

762
00:43:13,071 --> 00:43:15,410
Scott: The comics make it worth suffering.

763
00:43:15,832 --> 00:43:16,790
Rym: It's very creative though.

764
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,826
Rym: It seems like he knew what he was doing HTML wise.

765
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:20,950
Rym: He just made it weird on purpose.

766
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:25,510
Scott: I think he's just more of an artist and not a web guy.

767
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:26,734
Scott: You know what.

768
00:43:26,775 --> 00:43:28,490
Rym: that's excusable because his comic is great.

769
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:29,430
Scott: I would definitely agree.

770
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:30,206
Scott: Weaboo.

771
00:43:31,255 --> 00:43:31,485
Rym: Weaboo.

772
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:37,050
Scott: I mean his comic made like you know the 100 coolest internet things ever list.

773
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,269
Scott: That why I did it a couple podcasts ago.

774
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:41,828
Scott: It was my thing of the day.

775
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,829
Scott: His comic Weaboo was on there.

776
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:44,484
Rym: It is.

777
00:43:45,543 --> 00:43:45,627
Scott: Hey.

778
00:43:47,212 --> 00:43:50,670
Rym: So there's one I read and you don't read it called College Roomies from Hell.

779
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,570
Scott: Isn't that just some dumb drama crap?

780
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,410
Rym: It's awesome.

781
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,270
Rym: It's been going on for freaking ever.

782
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,150
Rym: And I've been reading it since before I really knew about web comics.

783
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,110
Rym: I've been reading this comic.

784
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,490
Scott: Yeah well Bob and George has been going on for freaking ever.

785
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,550
Scott: That doesn't make any better.

786
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,790
Rym: So you're admitting that Bob and George wasn't funny.

787
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:07,329
Scott: It was funny at some point.

788
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,546
Rym: See College Roomies from Hell is just.

789
00:44:10,707 --> 00:44:11,070
Rym: it's neat.

790
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:14,910
Rym: Partly because it's a very dialogue driven character driven comic.

791
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,730
Rym: And the plot it's kind of hard to explain.

792
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:18,348
Rym: It's just weird.

793
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:25,469
Rym: And it's been going on for so long that the only way to really understand it is to start from the beginning and read until you catch up.

794
00:44:25,771 --> 00:44:27,288
Rym: And then read it because updates every day.

795
00:44:28,272 --> 00:44:31,650
Rym: And just a couple of panels of character driven comedy drama.

796
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:34,237
Rym: But the main thing that is going for it is the.

797
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,990
Rym: you know the zings in 8-bit theater times a million.

798
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:40,409
Rym: And that's what almost all the dialogue is in this comic.

799
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,608
Scott: It seems like all the plot isn't really like an intelligent thoughtful plot.

800
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,730
Scott: It's like a waste of time to read plot.

801
00:44:48,992 --> 00:44:50,310
Rym: No the plot is silly.

802
00:44:51,351 --> 00:44:53,810
Rym: And it doesn't matter because all that matters are the characters.

803
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,610
Rym: And the characters are fantastic.

804
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,849
Rym: Well you don't like anything good so.

805
00:44:58,311 --> 00:44:58,969
Rym: Yeah okay.

806
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:00,693
Rym: It's weird.

807
00:45:00,713 --> 00:45:03,350
Rym: I've got a lot of emotional investment in these characters.

808
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,890
Rym: Just because I've been reading for so long and the characters are so well developed.

809
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:11,530
Rym: Kind of like 8-bit theater how the characters are so well defined and well developed.

810
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,226
Scott: I read at least one more webcomic.

811
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,709
Scott: Perhaps one of the most recently discovered and most hilarious webcomics there is.

812
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,610
Rym: Oh god there's the new comic we just discovered.

813
00:45:22,173 --> 00:45:22,437
Rym: Dr.

814
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:23,270
Rym: McNinja.

815
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:25,389
Scott: That's not it but that's a good one.

816
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:25,872
Rym: Dr.

817
00:45:25,912 --> 00:45:28,410
Rym: McNinja is about a ninja doctor and that sounds stupid.

818
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:29,388
Rym: You know what it is stupid.

819
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:30,510
Rym: But you know what else?

820
00:45:30,673 --> 00:45:31,470
Rym: It's still awesome.

821
00:45:31,871 --> 00:45:32,809
Scott: It's very awesome.

822
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:36,289
Scott: It's like it's kind of like a space ghost humor going on.

823
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:38,129
Rym: That's the best way to describe it.

824
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,030
Scott: I think it is exactly space ghost humor which I like.

825
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:41,989
Scott: Some people don't like it.

826
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,762
Scott: If you don't like space ghost you probably won't like Dr.

827
00:45:43,802 --> 00:45:44,527
Scott: McNinja but.

828
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:47,070
Rym: It's probably the only space ghost humor I get anymore.

829
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,290
Rym: I don't see space ghost anymore.

830
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,520
Scott: I don't think space goes on anymore but there's.

831
00:45:50,621 --> 00:45:54,890
Scott: I think there's still at least one or two shows on like Adult Swim and some random time that are like it.

832
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:55,930
Scott: I don't know I don't watch TV.

833
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,049
Scott: It's just a guess.

834
00:45:57,331 --> 00:45:58,710
Rym: Are there DVDs of space ghosts?

835
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,196
Scott: Yeah they put spaces.

836
00:46:00,497 --> 00:46:02,650
Scott: I think the first and second seasons might be out on DVD.

837
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,190
Rym: I think we should uh get all on that.

838
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:07,169
Scott: Get all Netflix in that house.

839
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:11,089
Rym: Yeah if we get if we put in our Netflix queue now we'll see him two years from now.

840
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:15,349
Scott: Of course that's not the comic that I was originally referring to but you did.

841
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,709
Scott: you were correct that it was the most recently discovered one.

842
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,229
Scott: The second most recently discovered one.

843
00:46:22,551 --> 00:46:24,030
Rym: Order of the stick.

844
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,349
Scott: Is infinitely more hilarious than.

845
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:33,610
Rym: It is a comic about a Dungeons and Dragons campaign and it is full of jokes about Dungeons and Dragons and rules and Dungeons and Dragons.

846
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:38,150
Rym: However even if you have never played Dungeons and Dragons it's still just as funny.

847
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:43,433
Scott: Yet my favorite comic is still the one where they walk into the town and it's like adventures are coming.

848
00:46:43,493 --> 00:46:48,844
Scott: adventures are coming and they start boarding up the town like the adventures are going to blow it up which you know is what you would normally think.

849
00:46:49,347 --> 00:46:55,174
Scott: and then oh they're trying to sell things to the adventures at inflated prices because they're loaded with gold.

850
00:46:55,194 --> 00:47:01,430
Scott: but the adventurers love the small towns and it implies that all the small towns do this and it's hilarious.

851
00:47:02,891 --> 00:47:16,694
Scott: But the thing about that the best part jokes in order to the stick that I like is unlike red maid she was just like this kind of blatant I am tweaking guy is like they met a game in the comic.

852
00:47:17,055 --> 00:47:21,532
Scott: but since you never see that the piece you never see the actual people playing these characters.

853
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,956
Scott: you just see the characters the whole time.

854
00:47:23,976 --> 00:47:39,611
Scott: it's like you know or like you'll see this like bard like oh I know I'll use my song to distract them out.

855
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:45,973
Scott: and then he you know he sings a song like you know bash down the door bash down the door.

856
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:47,539
Scott: you can do it.

857
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,109
Scott: bash down the door and it doesn't actually help him bash.

858
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:51,273
Rym: that was the greatest.

859
00:47:51,334 --> 00:48:01,049
Rym: I think the only really funny one with that kind of joke was when he's singing the song to help the other guy move stealthily sneak sneak sneak past the garbs.

860
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,435
Rym: hope they don't hear you sneaking.

861
00:48:04,016 --> 00:48:07,743
Rym: yeah it's a good comic.

862
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,347
Scott: it's very excellent.

863
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:16,168
Scott: I definitely anticipate it greatly every three times a week but I don't know.

864
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:18,514
Scott: the guy seems to update later in the day now.

865
00:48:19,035 --> 00:48:34,038
Rym: recently now one comic I used to read of all the old huge comics but it ended quite a while ago was exploitation now which was insanely popular and it was just funny and gooey and it was really good.

866
00:48:34,439 --> 00:48:38,915
Scott: that was not a fan yeah but it was too dirty and it was dirty.

867
00:48:38,935 --> 00:48:40,359
Scott: I'm not a fan.

868
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:43,189
Rym: it wasn't as dirty as uh thin h line but it was dirty.

869
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:44,875
Scott: I'm not a fan of the dirty comics.

870
00:48:45,116 --> 00:48:59,518
Rym: but then Michael Poe ended it ended it and now he's doing a new comic called errant story which is a semi-manga styling uh fantasy and it's comedy slash drama and it's not dirty like exploitation.

871
00:48:59,598 --> 00:49:15,299
Rym: I was and you know what it's just a really good solid uh story and the art is most excellent and that was GeekNights with Rym and scott.
