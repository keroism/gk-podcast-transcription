1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,248
Rym: It's Monday, April 22nd, 2013.

2
00:00:10,248 --> 00:00:10,630
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,616
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,044
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:19,700
Rym: Tonight we talk about why Google Reader died and RSS is dying.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,878
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:28,279
Rym: The answer being... Because they're so ratchet.

8
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:30,016
Scott: You and that ratchet?

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,209
Rym: It's never going away.

10
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:32,280
Rym: I'm digging this.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,640
Rym: So I had the unfortunate experience of causing a homeless man to be pretty severely beaten up.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,084
Scott: What?

13
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:39,619
Scott: Did you beat him up?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,720
Rym: I did not beat him up.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,179
Scott: Did you lie and say he did something he didn't do?

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,115
Rym: No, but I...

17
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:45,071
Scott: What did you do?

18
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:45,660
Scott: This is crazy.

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:54,080
Rym: My direct action led to him laying on the ground, screaming in pain, believing a substantial amount of blood on the ground.

20
00:00:54,944 --> 00:00:55,940
Scott: How is this even possible?

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,180
Rym: So the reason I'm going to tell this story is it's not really related to technology or anything.

22
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:04,780
Rym: I'm very conflicted about what happened and whether or not I did the right thing.

23
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:11,560
Rym: And when I get to the end of this, I will ask you what you will do if you encounter a similar situation going forward.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,766
Scott: Well, of course there's the philosophical "What would I

25
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:14,007
Scott: do?"

26
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:17,097
Scott: and also the "You are standing there at that moment.

27
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:17,879
Scott: What actually you

28
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:18,040
Scott: do?".

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,760
Rym: True, but now there's the zebra storyteller situation because for me it's that.

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,220
Rym: It's that if I encounter a similar situation again, I may act very differently from how I acted this time.

31
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:34,540
Rym: So I left the Nerd NYC night a little early because I wanted to come home and poke at the bunnies and take care of some stuff.

32
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:37,399
Scott: Is this the guy who lays on the vent because it's warm?

33
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,403
Rym: No, no, no.

34
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:39,912
Rym: So I was going to meet Emily.

35
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:41,160
Rym: We're going to go home together.

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,999
Rym: So I walked over to Washington Square Park.

37
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:49,180
Rym: While I was waiting, I'm on the phone with my stepdad, just kind of talking, and I hear a commotion.

38
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:50,900
Rym: So I turn.

39
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,360
Scott: I would ignore the commotion.

40
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,760
Rym: Oh, I ignore commotions other than you turn and look to see if it is approaching.

41
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,220
Scott: Yeah.

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,560
Rym: Because occasionally it is approaching commotion.

43
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:04,499
Rym: So I turn and look and I see what appears to be an agitated homeless man, which is not...

44
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,128
Scott: I mean, this is a crowded park, right?

45
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,980
Scott: So you don't have to be the one to deal with this.

46
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,740
Rym: Apparently I did because no one else dealt with it.

47
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:11,320
Scott: Really?

48
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,099
Rym: No one else engaged at all except the people...

49
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,000
Scott: But there's plenty of people there.

50
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,420
Rym: Yeah, so now I'm wondering if next time around I will be one of those people who just lets it happen.

51
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:29,000
Rym: So I see someone who appears at first glance to be an agitated homeless man, which is not that uncommon in New York.

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,698
Scott: Yeah, I see that all the time.

53
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,100
Rym: Has kicked over some street musician's business and is yelling at him and trying to punch him.

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,063
Scott: Well, you don't know.

55
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:42,720
Scott: Obviously someone trying to punch is, you know, in the wrong, but you don't know if maybe... Exactly.

56
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,858
Scott: Maybe that musician did something to that homeless person to taunt them or something.

57
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:47,240
Scott: You don't know.

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,370
Rym: So my immediate response is to, "Dad, gotta call you back,".

59
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:53,320
Rym: and I'm watching in case whatever goes down to be a witness.

60
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,580
Rym: Because I would really like for someone else to be a witness if I'm ever engaged in one of these crazy things.

61
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,004
Rym: Of course.

62
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:59,560
Scott: You want to make sure that justice happens.

63
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,960
Rym: So I'm getting ready to video, but I realized it was too dark, so I just figured I'd watch and pay attention as much as possible while keeping a wide berth.

64
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,279
Scott: Video's a good idea, though.

65
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:19,660
Rym: So it becomes pretty quickly apparent that very likely, whatever led up to this, the homeless man is extra agitated and is basically following this guy trying to legit attack him.

66
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,379
Rym: And the guy is like...

67
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,960
Scott: What is the guy doing?

68
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,420
Rym: So the guy is doing that situation of like holding him back, like trying to make him not punch him, and trying to push him back and then run away.

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,180
Rym: But the homeless guy keeps following him and attacking him, kicking and punching and flailing.

70
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,620
Scott: And there's no cops around.

71
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:35,180
Rym: No cops.

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,658
Scott: In the park.

73
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:36,840
Rym: No one's reacting at all.

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,333
Rym: So some other guy comes over like, "Yo man, calm

75
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:39,514
Rym: down.".

76
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:40,620
Rym: Like trying to calm the guy down.

77
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:42,739
Rym: So the guy turns and tries to attack him.

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,720
Rym: So then the first guy walks over to pick up his kid again, and the homeless guy runs back over to him and hauls back and punches him in the face.

79
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:53,446
Rym: But on the cheek.

80
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:54,492
Rym: But pretty hard.

81
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:55,780
Rym: Like I heard it connect.

82
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:56,959
Scott: Is the guy out?

83
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:58,097
Rym: So no.

84
00:03:58,782 --> 00:03:59,840
Scott: Homeless guy's not too strong.

85
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,900
Rym: At this point, I decide I'm going to call the police because it's obvious no one has called the police.

86
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:05,899
Scott: That is a good idea.

87
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,040
Rym: So I call 911.

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,100
Scott: Can't be faulted for calling the police.

89
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:14,960
Rym: And I give them what I consider to be an extremely accurate description of what happened, what I had seen.

90
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:22,300
Scott: That's very good to give the accurate report on the 911 call because that is on the recording that will be used in a court of law at some point.

91
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,863
Scott: I made it very clear.

92
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:31,720
Rym: I did not see the altercation that led up to this, but that right now there is a gentleman who has attacked two people, extremely agitated, yada yada yada.

93
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,551
Rym: So the cops are like,

94
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:34,953
Rym: "Okay."

95
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,100
Rym: They'll send someone.

96
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:40,640
Rym: So they tell me to hang around in the park to direct the police when they arrive.

97
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:46,638
Rym: And I just kind of hang out watching this guy continue to menace anyone who comes near him.

98
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:51,700
Rym: But no longer going after the guy he punched because that guy basically was like, "Fuck this," and just ran.

99
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:52,376
Scott: Good job.

100
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,760
Rym: Eventually, over the next few minutes, he kind of calms down, and everyone who he had attacked is no longer in the park.

101
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,105
Rym: Gone.

102
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:00,840
Rym: Completely gone.

103
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:10,520
Rym: So he's sitting there, and I'm just kind of watching him from a distance, being agitated in that homeless man way, but not doing anything further threatening.

104
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:12,714
Rym: And this is when the cops show up.

105
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:13,140
Rym: Two cops.

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,817
Scott: A little late.

107
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,060
Rym: Yeah, it takes about five minutes to get there.

108
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
Scott: So the cops beat him up for no reason, basically.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,320
Rym: So the cops show up, and I'm trying to be very careful to not project my impressions upon this situation.

110
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:38,694
Rym: But the one cop who shows up is pretty young and pretty in that typical looks kind of hardcore and asks me to point the gentleman out, and then basically starts putting words in my mouth, being like, "So how many people did he attack?

111
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:39,597
Rym: Was he violent?

112
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:40,079
Rym: He's armed,

113
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:40,340
Rym: right?".

114
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,908
Rym: And I'm like, "No, he's not armed.

115
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:44,733
Rym: He punched one person.

116
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:46,499
Rym: He interacted with two

117
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:46,800
Rym: people.".

118
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,958
Rym: And the guy's like, "So he punched several people, and he's really, really trying to get

119
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:52,179
Rym: me.".

120
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,977
Scott: I would have taken a picture of his badge and then reported him to the police complaint thing, and I would have recorded the cop.

121
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,379
Rym: So the homeless guy's being real kind of weird and agitated in the corner, so I'm like, "That's the

122
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:04,580
Rym: guy.".

123
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,800
Rym: So the cops then approach him in a very professional manner, shine the light on him, start asking him questions, and he starts acting crazy.

124
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:13,350
Scott: How crazy did he get?

125
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,500
Scott: Did he attack the cops first?

126
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,620
Rym: So he stands up and starts dancing around going hootily, hootily, hootily, hootily, hootily, hootily, hootily.

127
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,380
Scott: Did he attack the cops, or did he just go hootily, hootily?

128
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,871
Rym: At that point, he didn't attack the cops.

129
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:23,160
Rym: He was going hootily, hootily, hootily, hootily.

130
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,973
Rym: So the cop says, "Get on the ground.

131
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:26,737
Rym: You're under

132
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:27,119
Rym: arrest."

133
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:27,917
Rym: For being hootily?

134
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,580
Rym: He's going to arrest him for the assault and all that, I guess.

135
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:31,607
Scott: I guess.

136
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:32,938
Scott: Yeah, he's allowed to do that.

137
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:33,220
Scott: Sure.

138
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,022
Rym: The guy's crazy.

139
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:39,360
Rym: So the cops want to go over, and then as soon as the cops approach, he starts arm flailing.

140
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:48,280
Rym: So then they pepper spray him and drill him the fuck into the ground and might have broken his nose, definitely busted his lips, blood everywhere.

141
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,870
Scott: It wasn't like a Rodney King situation.

142
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,460
Scott: They weren't like kicking him on the ground or whacking him with sticks.

143
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:57,500
Rym: Well, the guy had the stick out and was ready to hit him with the stick.

144
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,539
Scott: Yeah, but did he like wail on him with it?

145
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,940
Rym: No, but he pepper sprayed him and basically face planted him into the ground pretty hard, blood everywhere.

146
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:07,618
Scott: That's sort of what cops do.

147
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:20,189
Rym: And then held him there for like 15 minutes because it took that long for an ambulance or anyone to come, while the guy's just laying there screaming in pain, yelling stuff, getting kind of agitated and crazy, but mostly pathetic, then a crowd shows up.

148
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,120
Rym: So the cops scream at everyone, get back, get back, get back.

149
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:24,990
Rym: And everyone's like, dude, give the man some water.

150
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,660
Rym: And this crazy situation happens.

151
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:30,932
Rym: Now, the reason I'm conflicted is that they've arrested this guy.

152
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:33,220
Rym: He was bloodied, pretty severely hurt.

153
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,720
Scott: Probably belong to the Nuthouse, this guy.

154
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:34,995
Scott: Yes.

155
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,040
Scott: He'll probably end up in a psych ward somewhere.

156
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:45,880
Rym: However, at the same time, while this guy obviously needs some psych ward help, I'm not confident that's what he's going to get out of this situation.

157
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:47,648
Scott: Well, who knows what he's going to get?

158
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:50,060
Scott: I guess he'll get what every other crazy homeless guy gets these days.

159
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:50,540
Rym: Yeah.

160
00:07:50,801 --> 00:08:02,380
Rym: But the level of immediate escalation of the cops, coupled with the fact that while he attacked two people, he attacked two people in that sort of, I'm a crazily homeless guy being crazy.

161
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:11,920
Rym: And once the people he had attacked were gone and they didn't seem interested in calling the police or doing anything, he went back to sitting in the corner, kind of shuffling around being crazy.

162
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:21,080
Rym: I don't know if he's better off just letting him be or letting the police do what they did to him, because I don't know if he's going to get any treatment.

163
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,681
Scott: I don't know.

164
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:27,280
Scott: The police felt it was worth their time to check him out, but they don't feel it's worth their time to check out bike thieves.

165
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:27,841
Rym: Yep.

166
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:31,120
Rym: Well, they checked him out because I called the police and then they wanted me to stay.

167
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:32,628
Rym: And this is where it got kind of weird.

168
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:33,714
Rym: They made me stay.

169
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:34,880
Rym: They wanted me to give a statement.

170
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,000
Rym: They took like all my information.

171
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,500
Scott: Well, you gave probably a really good statement.

172
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:38,582
Rym: Yeah.

173
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:40,130
Rym: They didn't have any fucking paper.

174
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:42,120
Rym: They didn't have no pads.

175
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,958
Scott: You didn't record the statement audio wise?

176
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,620
Rym: I didn't have a good way to do that because the park's kind of loud at this point.

177
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,187
Rym: There's a crowd yelling at the cops.

178
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:49,854
Rym: So they kept trying to take my statement.

179
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:51,120
Rym: of the four cops there.

180
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,440
Rym: Not one of them has a piece of paper, laptops in the car or pencil.

181
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,979
Rym: They apparently can't take statements that way.

182
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:09,033
Rym: So eventually, and they kept every cop I talked to was trying to put words into my mouth, trying to get me to say that he did way more than he did.

183
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:11,160
Rym: And I held the line pretty hard.

184
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:16,780
Rym: So luckily I gave a pretty accurate statement to 911. that's recorded.

185
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:25,638
Rym: So I'm hoping that I just, I feel like if I see a homeless man in an altercation like this, I'm just going to ignore it or watch it, but not call the police next time.

186
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:31,279
Scott: One time that I think I've told this story on the show, there was a long time ago.

187
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,040
Rym: Oh, when you restrained that crazy lady.

188
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:33,584
Scott: Exactly.

189
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,400
Scott: They restrained the crazy lady, right?

190
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,280
Scott: It was basically, I was on a subway and a crazy lady starts attacking some girl who's much younger and less crazy.

191
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,009
Scott: Who's just trying to go to work, right?

192
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:45,020
Scott: And the girl is just like walking away, ignoring.

193
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,139
Scott: And the crazy lady is all going like, so I just restrained the crazy lady for like 10 seconds.

194
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,330
Scott: And the girl was an out of sight.

195
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,099
Scott: And I let the crazy lady go and I went to work.

196
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:59,259
Rym: Putting yourself at substantial risk of liability, but also probably the right thing to do.

197
00:09:59,501 --> 00:09:59,884
Scott: Well, yeah.

198
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:01,679
Scott: And then, you know, I didn't do anything beyond that.

199
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,936
Scott: And then some guy came up to me and he was like, oh man, you're crazy.

200
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:05,699
Scott: What if she had a knife?

201
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:10,340
Scott: And I'm like, that crazy lady didn't have a knife or she would have already used it on that girl.

202
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:15,620
Scott: And then he's like, you know, I'm like, and if I get stabbed by a crazy lady, I don't have to go to work.

203
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:22,300
Rym: But I feel like in this situation, like I made it pretty clear that this guy is just crazy, but not directly dangerous.

204
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:35,400
Rym: And it was obvious to anyone watching that this guy, while he was all widdly, widdly, widdly, was not a danger to the young, well-armed fit group of four police officers surrounding him.

205
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:43,559
Rym: So I feel like some sort of government official, or there should be a special cop whose job is to...

206
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,340
Scott: You mean the internal affairs department?

207
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:53,359
Rym: No, someone who, instead of going straight for the pepper spray, when there's the crazy homeless guy, the guy who walks over and be like, hey man, let's chat.

208
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:59,459
Rym: Instead of, hey man, I'm holding a nightstick and pepper spray and shining a light in your face and yelling at you.

209
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:01,799
Rym: Anyway, that was my night.

210
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,800
Scott: When you got a hammer, everything looks like nails.

211
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:13,780
Rym: Simultaneously, biking home from the botanical garden yesterday, we saw the results of a bike accident where a car pretty clearly just drilled some biker and he was on the ground, pretty hurt.

212
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,520
Scott: Did it look like the biker was running the red light?

213
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,518
Rym: Today it looks like the guy in the car was pretty much at fault, but I didn't say it, can't say.

214
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,019
Rym: But this is why I'm inspired to bring this anecdote up.

215
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,800
Rym: I feel like whenever there is a situation, and you know what I mean by a situation.

216
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,399
Scott: The world has no justice, we know this.

217
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:56,240
Rym: Whenever there's a situation, I feel like the best thing you can ever do as a person is not necessarily to call the police, definitely not necessarily to intervene, but to video, record, and remember to the best of your ability what actually happened and stick around to be able to give the actual, basically be willing to be the witness for the dude who got hit by the car so the guy who hit him actually does go to jail.

218
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,540
Rym: Like, actually go to court and try to get yourself to be a witness.

219
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,960
Scott: If you want justice, you have to take it in your own hands because there isn't going to come justice from anywhere else.

220
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,860
Rym: Yup, and not to bring up the whole Boston thing.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,775
Scott: Except for that judge who contented himself.

222
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:09,319
Scott: Good job, judge.

223
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,558
Rym: Yeah, props to him.

224
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:14,180
Scott: $25 fine on himself for cell phone going off in the court.

225
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:23,860
Rym: But the fact that the Boston thing also kind of got resolved so quickly because so many people had so much video and took so much record of the thing going on, it's real important.

226
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:32,145
Rym: And in New York City, at least, the guy who was hit by the car, there was some other biker who had obviously witnessed it who was sticking around.

227
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:37,240
Rym: He was taking pictures of the car, of the driver of the car, the license plate, the accident.

228
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:39,687
Rym: He was like sticking around.

229
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:43,099
Rym: He's one of those biker guys who's like, "I'm going to make sure that justice

230
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:43,360
Rym: happens.".

231
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:47,220
Scott: If I go on Reddit R bicycles or Reddit R New York, I might see this.

232
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,363
Rym: I might see that.

233
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:52,780
Rym: It was right at the intersection like under where the 7, like on the way to the Pulaski Bridge, like right there.

234
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:54,185
Rym: You know where that is.

235
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,117
Rym: Anyway, that killed about 12 minutes.

236
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:57,301
Scott: Nice.

237
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:58,588
Scott: My only opening bit is that all.

238
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:00,700
Scott: last night when I was sleeping, my whole arm fell asleep.

239
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,260
Scott: I was sort of half asleep.

240
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,385
Rym: That's why I sleep on my back.

241
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:05,880
Rym: If I sleep on my side, my arm definitely will fall asleep.

242
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,460
Scott: All day today, my thumb has been...

243
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,740
Rym: Probably pinched a nerve while you were asleep.

244
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:11,559
Scott: It's starting to come back a little bit now.

245
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:18,180
Rym: You know, drunk people, if they're super drunk and they pass out or fall asleep in a weird way, can cause permanent nerve damage by laying on a limb like all night.

246
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,179
Scott: Another reason not to get drunk.

247
00:13:19,722 --> 00:13:22,300
Rym: Well, you've got to be pretty fucking drunk for that to happen.

248
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,802
Scott: Okay, so news time.

249
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:36,140
Scott: To follow up on our Thursday episode about drugs, there's this interesting story going around about the psychological side effects of Tylenol.

250
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:41,853
Scott: Yeah, apparently acetaminophen has psychological side effects.

251
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:44,360
Scott: They're not like immediate or obvious or severe.

252
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:47,180
Scott: And it's like you don't get addicted to it and it doesn't kill you, right?

253
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,380
Scott: So it's like you don't really notice even though these things exist.

254
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,846
Rym: But what do they define?

255
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:55,180
Rym: I mean, blocking pain receptors, does that count or something more substantial?

256
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:05,660
Scott: Right, so apparently not only does Tylenol ease pain of physical pain, it also apparently eases psychological pain.

257
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:09,180
Scott: Such as existential dread or anxiety.

258
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:09,691
Rym: Really?

259
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,200
Scott: Yeah, you know, you can read all these details about it, but it's pretty fascinating.

260
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,089
Scott: So it says here, "We think that Tylenol is blocking existential unease.

261
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:24,999
Scott: in the same way it prevents pain because a similar neurological process is responsible for both types of

262
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:25,380
Scott: distress.".

263
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:32,100
Rym: You know, it's interesting because dread like that is a clinical symptom of many different specific disorders.

264
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,540
Rym: Like it is one of a list of things, like if you have the list of these things and dread is one of them, you might have this disease.

265
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,944
Scott: Yep, but it's also interesting.

266
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:41,347
Scott: I saw some discussion online.

267
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:45,757
Scott: I don't know how randy or not this is, but they're talking about some other alternative thing.

268
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,380
Scott: that's not ibuprofen, right?

269
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,267
Scott: It's some other alternative to acetaminophen.

270
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:56,040
Scott: that's apparently way poisonous if you take too much, but otherwise is less liver damaging.

271
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:58,880
Scott: And I guess other countries you can get it, but not here.

272
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,498
Rym: What is it?

273
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:00,620
Scott: I forget what it's called.

274
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:00,960
Scott: Great.

275
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,139
Scott: I probably shouldn't even mention it.

276
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,838
Rym: That's some journalism.

277
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,259
Scott: Probably shouldn't even mention it.

278
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,820
Rym: Hey, I heard about this thing that I don't have any citations for nor do I remember the name of it.

279
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,200
Scott: Should have just skipped.

280
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,420
Rym: I'm going to bring it up on this news portion of a broadcast out of nowhere.

281
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:16,277
Rym: I don't know.

282
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:19,400
Rym: Scott, that is the very definition of ratchet.

283
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,329
Scott: Sure.

284
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:21,340
Scott: Anyway.

285
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:29,460
Rym: So I'm not going to talk about CISPA passing the house except that I'm done with technological law bullshit.

286
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:32,787
Rym: Burn bridges at this point.

287
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:35,120
Rym: Anyone who voted for that, I will never vote for again.

288
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,399
Scott: Surprisingly, my representative did not.

289
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,438
Rym: I didn't check mine yet.

290
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,100
Scott: They were in the nay column.

291
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,940
Scott: Because it's not election time yet.

292
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,640
Scott: It's the same person, Rym.

293
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,784
Rym: All right.

294
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:43,660
Rym: Well, the thing is the lines are pretty close.

295
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:44,799
Scott: It's the same person.

296
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,840
Rym: We're represented by this area, but we're also like our same district.

297
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,680
Scott: We have different people for different things, but in the federal house you have the same person.

298
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,900
Scott: I think it's Carolyn Maloney.

299
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,620
Rym: So look at this list and the people who voted yes with the exception of Harry Reid because he had to change his vote to yes for procedural reasons.

300
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,898
Rym: He didn't vote for it because he wanted to.

301
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:05,679
Scott: How does that even happen?

302
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,580
Rym: Well, so any law, I don't know if it was Harry Reid in this case, but it's because that Senate has a similar procedure.

303
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:24,100
Rym: If you're a sponsor of a bill and there's other situations and it is being voted on, there are situations where if you want to bring it up again later, you have to be someone who voted against it.

304
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:32,140
Rym: So there are people who will vote for or against something and then have to flip their vote before it's counted to be able to do something else later.

305
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,040
Rym: It usually happens in the Senate.

306
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,840
Scott: That's ridiculous.

307
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,140
Rym: But I read that someone did something similar in this vote in the House.

308
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,639
Rym: I'll have to look up who it was and why.

309
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,738
Rym: But yeah, if you vote for bad technology things, I don't care what your other stances are, I will just never vote for you again ever.

310
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,120
Scott: And make that the primary issue above all the other issues?

311
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,169
Rym: Well, it doesn't mean I'll vote for the stupid Republican.

312
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,380
Rym: It just means I won't vote in that vote, whatever it is.

313
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,120
Scott: Oh, you just abstain?

314
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,299
Rym: Yeah, I'll just abstain.

315
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:00,117
Scott: Abstaining is okay.

316
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,079
Rym: On tech issues, I'm done with this.

317
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,973
Rym: There's no way I can vote for someone who doesn't understand this stuff.

318
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,720
Rym: and this was pretty bad legislation.

319
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,032
Scott: It's not good, but it's not as bad as SOPA in that it doesn't break the internet.

320
00:17:13,113 --> 00:17:15,619
Scott: It just violates everybody's rights.

321
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,700
Rym: The thing is, nothing has ever come as close to as bad as the CBDTPA.

322
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:20,880
Scott: Yeah, it's true.

323
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,900
Rym: And we beat that one, but you know people are just chomping at the bit to bring it back.

324
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:32,180
Scott: The thing is, if CISPA passes, it won't really affect me personally that much because I hang everything out there anyway.

325
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,410
Scott: It's like, yeah, check me out.

326
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:34,299
Scott: I'm not hiding anything.

327
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,697
Scott: Yeah, but in principle.

328
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,651
Scott: In principle, it's very wrong.

329
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:37,792
Scott: 1984 wrong.

330
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,002
Rym: Well, here's the crazy thing.

331
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:42,792
Rym: I am for some of the ideas of CISPA.

332
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,260
Rym: I just think CISPA is shittily written and dangerous.

333
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,583
Scott: Wow, that's also true.

334
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:51,540
Scott: But I mean, in that case, we have a lot of already shittily written and dangerous laws that have already passed.

335
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,920
Rym: Yeah, but people get me wrong and a lot of technologists wrong in a lot of these things.

336
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,760
Rym: We're totally okay with crazy technological surveillance.

337
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:06,480
Rym: We're just not okay with people getting the right to do that in the government without a warrant.

338
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:07,399
Scott: That's right.

339
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:17,180
Rym: If you get a warrant, like a judge is like, "Yes, this is okay," I give you almost carte blanche to spy on someone for the extent of that warrant.

340
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,269
Rym: The problem is, we have a system for warrants.

341
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:27,876
Rym: Why do all these tech laws try to get around that and say, "Oh, well, you don't need to warrant to follow someone's GPS coordinates with their cell phone because

342
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:27,976
Rym: blah.".

343
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:42,220
Scott: Well, it's basically what it is, is police just want their job to be easier and their job is getting at least harder, either because A, they are not hip with the world, B, because of laws, I basically make it.

344
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,620
Scott: It would be easier for me to do detective work than a detective because of so many limitations on the things they're allowed to do.

345
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,910
Rym: Yeah, I want your job to be really hard to be easy.

346
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:57,260
Rym: It should be hard to get the right to do those things easily, but it should be easy to do those things once you need to do them.

347
00:18:57,581 --> 00:19:01,417
Scott: But you need to get enough information in the first place to get a warrant, which is not easy.

348
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:01,799
Scott: I don't know.

349
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:04,188
Scott: You think it's pretty easy to get warrants.

350
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,158
Scott: I guess they're just lazy because it means you have to do some paper.

351
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:06,500
Scott: I don't know.

352
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:08,206
Rym: I don't know.

353
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:11,080
Rym: I think the people sponsoring this bill have ulterior motives.

354
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,295
Scott: I don't know what they're thinking.

355
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:12,560
Scott: Whatever.

356
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:14,003
Rym: Here's an issue.

357
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:14,646
Rym: This is my news.

358
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:29,320
Rym: It's baseball, which you think would be Tuesday or maybe Thursday, but it's on Monday because one issue in technology that no one who listens to GeekNights, unless you work in SAP or medical stuff, will know anything about or care about.

359
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,547
Rym: But it's a big part of why technology sucks.

360
00:19:32,848 --> 00:19:37,039
Rym: Coding data is such a thorny problem that no one is solved.

361
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:37,400
Rym: well.

362
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,440
Rym: Like in medical records, how do you encode a doctor's report of someone?

363
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,909
Rym: How do you encode, "I checked out their left elbow"?

364
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:45,572
Rym: It's fine.

365
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,420
Rym: The right elbow had a lump on it.

366
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:56,176
Rym: How do you put that data in a way that is searchable without resorting to Google like, "Well, let's search for ankle or elbow just in

367
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:56,478
Rym: case.".

368
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,729
Scott: That's the answer.

369
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:00,560
Scott: Free text input.

370
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,360
Rym: That's not the answer.

371
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,220
Scott: That's all you can really do because doctors, all they do is scribble, not even in between the lines.

372
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:17,879
Rym: Actually, Scott, there's really defined ways of coding this stuff, but I want to use an example from baseball because something crazy happened recently in a baseball game.

373
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:21,000
Rym: I'm going to paraphrase from Slashdot.

374
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:26,876
Rym: Segura of the Milwaukee Brewers, I don't know any of these players.

375
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,220
Rym: I don't follow baseball for shit.

376
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:29,240
Scott: You're probably saying his name wrong.

377
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,363
Rym: Yeah, Segura.

378
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:36,180
Rym: Jean Segura of the Milwaukee Brewers stole second base.

379
00:20:37,242 --> 00:20:48,220
Rym: Now we have a way in the software where we do the box score for baseball to encode that someone attempted to steal second or succeeded in stealing second.

380
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:54,440
Rym: And people who care about sports care a lot about the accuracy of those ridiculous stats.

381
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,608
Rym: How many times did this guy swing at a ball?

382
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,476
Rym: How many times did he touch the ball with the bat?

383
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:01,540
Rym: Things like that.

384
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:03,104
Rym: Alright, so far so good.

385
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:06,753
Rym: There was a way in the software that official MLB uses to code that.

386
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:09,140
Rym: Then he tried to steal third.

387
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:12,224
Rym: He failed.

388
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:16,960
Rym: He did it too early, but he made it back to second base before being tagged.

389
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,660
Scott: Okay, that's you safe at second.

390
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:27,300
Rym: But his teammate Ryan Braun had already made it to second base while he was on his way to third having stolen second.

391
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,400
Scott: That's pretty bad because they're going to both be out at the same base.

392
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:38,399
Rym: So after tags were applied to both base runners, Segura started running, trotting back to the dugout.

393
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,093
Rym: But then he realized that the play hadn't been completed.

394
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:45,040
Rym: He wasn't yet officially out.

395
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:45,646
Scott: He was.

396
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,299
Scott: He got tagged.

397
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,120
Rym: So Braun's only option was to try to make it back to first.

398
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,460
Scott: But wasn't Braun also tagged?

399
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,001
Rym: No, no.

400
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:59,731
Rym: So Segura was trotting back to the dugout, didn't realize that Braun wasn't out.

401
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:03,760
Rym: Braun tries to run all the way back to first.

402
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:06,019
Rym: And I believe, let's see.

403
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:07,180
Scott: Why didn't he just stay at second?

404
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:08,444
Rym: I don't know.

405
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:11,580
Rym: Probably because I need to draw this to figure out what happened.

406
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,911
Rym: Basically, guy from first steals second, guy from second steals third.

407
00:22:15,574 --> 00:22:17,400
Rym: Doesn't make it to third, has to go back to second.

408
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,320
Rym: But his friends at second, so his friends run backwards to first.

409
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:27,100
Scott: But if the guy who was running back to second became out from tagging, the guy who stole second could have just stayed there.

410
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,000
Rym: So I guess you want me to read the full thing then, CaptainBaseball?

411
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:31,519
Scott: I'm just saying it doesn't make a lot of sense.

412
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,443
Rym: Alright, alright.

413
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:35,340
Rym: So we're going to have to read the whole thing because I can't draw it on a podcast.

414
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,700
Rym: Guy stole second, he then tries to steal third, doesn't make it, ends up running back to first base.

415
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:42,595
Rym: What?

416
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,440
Rym: Then he got thrown out trying to steal second again over the course of five pitches.

417
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,391
Scott: Okay.

418
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:51,518
Scott: Sounds like bad baserunning to me.

419
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:56,100
Rym: The problem is, it was all perfectly legitimate and legal play.

420
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,700
Scott: I'm sure whatever happened on the field, the umpires made it legit.

421
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:04,300
Rym: And there is no possible way to encode that in any of the software used to track box scores.

422
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,256
Scott: No, because there's a certain way you keep score in baseball.

423
00:23:07,276 --> 00:23:07,980
Scott: I've done it before.

424
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:10,420
Scott: Pretty much when you go to a baseball game, that's what you do.

425
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,680
Scott: You get the program and the program comes with a scorecard and you keep score in each little box.

426
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,320
Scott: You write down, you know, these numbers for what happened.

427
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,704
Rym: Okay, here's a much better summary.

428
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:23,780
Rym: On a 2-2 pitch, Ryan Braun in the eighth inning, blah, blah, blah, stole second base.

429
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:29,900
Rym: On the next pitch, Braun walked, so far, pretty good.

430
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:39,640
Rym: Three pitches after that, Segura broke for third, but his first mistake was that he forgot to wait until the pitcher had actually delivered the ball.

431
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,060
Rym: So he effectively was stealing.

432
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:48,000
Rym: Camp, I don't know the names of his players, world and got Segura hung up between second and third base.

433
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:59,680
Rym: That led Braun to follow baseball one-on-one protocol and try to steal second base, which was proper and cool until Segura ran back to second base.

434
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:03,226
Rym: The Cubs started tagging everyone in the vicinity.

435
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:08,820
Rym: The rules say it was Braun who was out, but Segura thought he was the one who was out.

436
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,527
Rym: So we started walking toward the dugout along the way.

437
00:24:11,547 --> 00:24:16,040
Rym: He was told he wasn't actually technically out yet, so we ran back to first base.

438
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,025
Rym: The first base coach then told him not to leave.

439
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:24,800
Rym: Two pitches later, he ran toward second to try to steal it and was thrown out.

440
00:24:25,402 --> 00:24:27,800
Rym: And the sum of that is impossible to code.

441
00:24:28,141 --> 00:24:34,580
Scott: Oh, so Segura, who was on the way to third, went back to first because Braun was out when there were two people in second.

442
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Rym: If you want to get a job that won't pay much and will be boring as hell, but will solve the majority of problems we see in the healthcare industry, do a job that comes down to figuring out how to encode crazy bullshit like this in technology.

443
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:57,080
Scott: Every sport basically already has one piece of software that they use to keep score.

444
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,540
Scott: And this piece of program, I know a guy who used it to score college basketball games and things.

445
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:08,137
Scott: As the game is going, you basically type in with these keyboard shortcuts that are unique to that program.

446
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,040
Scott: everything that's happening.

447
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:13,820
Scott: And it has all the rosters and everything, and it sends all the data to everyone who needs it.

448
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,520
Scott: That's how come you can go to ESPN and find the score of the RIT hockey game.

449
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,480
Scott: Because some guy at the RIT hockey game has this program and is typing in what's going on with the keyboard shortcuts.

450
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:29,780
Scott: And these programs are horribly bad, but one guy wrote it at some point and it becomes the standard for that sport and everyone uses it everywhere.

451
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,824
Scott: And that's it.

452
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,316
Scott: And it's really hard to dislodge it.

453
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:32,800
Scott: The end.

454
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,509
Rym: Alright, I found a really, really detailed article of what happened.

455
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,192
Rym: I'm going to link to that.

456
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:39,940
Rym: You can read it yourself to figure out what actually happened.

457
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,600
Scott: I'm just going to watch a fucking YouTube video.

458
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,480
Rym: I think I understand it now, but without diagrams and video, it's almost impossible to follow this.

459
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:49,260
Rym: From what I can tell, this never happened before.

460
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:50,658
Scott: I don't think it has, no.

461
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:59,289
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

462
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:00,653
Rym: Found this video.

463
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:01,797
Rym: It's a music video.

464
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:02,800
Rym: Looks like it's from Russia.

465
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,873
Rym: It's from a band called Little Big, and I found a bunch more videos with the same guy.

466
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:10,240
Rym: Seems to be a sort of comedy duo.

467
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,749
Scott: That's your favorite kind of guy.

468
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,220
Scott: That's like a guy who's going to be on Eurovision.

469
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,419
Rym: Yeah, it's like comedy duo slash musicians, and it's him and two midgets, and you can see all their videos.

470
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:19,820
Rym: They're great.

471
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:28,460
Rym: But this one is some pretty apt commentary about the prospects for the youth and Russia in the future of Russia.

472
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:29,579
Scott: Drinking vodka all day?

473
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:36,878
Rym: The title is Every Day I'm Drinking, and the chorus is basically Every Day I'm Drinking, because there's no future, and that's it.

474
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:38,376
Scott: Okay.

475
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,540
Rym: With midgets, bears, vodka, and a dude who's really confused at the end.

476
00:26:43,124 --> 00:26:44,500
Scott: I've never heard of anything more Russian.

477
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:56,620
Rym: It's also got this pretty great sort of interesting vibe where a lot of the images in the video are sort of parodies of famous paintings of Russian high society.

478
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:05,800
Rym: Like you'll see, there's a point where the midget girl is standing in a dress, and she's pulling behind her this sort of like little stylized horse on some wheels.

479
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,900
Rym: There's a famous painting.

480
00:27:07,082 --> 00:27:07,599
Scott: I know that painting.

481
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,262
Rym: Yeah, that painting.

482
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:13,080
Rym: So every set piece seen in this is a parody of some painting like that.

483
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:14,663
Rym: It's great.

484
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:15,608
Rym: It'll get stuck in your head.

485
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:17,759
Rym: It's a really simple song, and there's a scary fucking clown.

486
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:28,115
Scott: Okay, so in 1978, there was- No, in '78, there was an F1 car called Le Liget Matre.

487
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:29,540
Scott: I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly.

488
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:30,984
Scott: It was a V12.

489
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:34,880
Scott: This video of it was taken off of YouTube, but now it's back on YouTube.

490
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,789
Scott: This car, I've never actually seen this car before recently.

491
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:42,860
Scott: This is probably the most amazing F1 car I've ever seen.

492
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:51,920
Scott: Like you watch this video, and number one, it sounds like exactly, it's like the most stereotypical race car sound.

493
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,502
Scott: It's just like this.

494
00:27:52,743 --> 00:27:58,160
Scott: unbelievable, you know, like F1 cars here, like this thing is like, it's unbelievable.

495
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,200
Scott: And then two, the way the video is shot, it looks like pole position.

496
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,576
Scott: Like if this was the only way you ever saw racing, you would think that pole position was the perfect racing simulator.

497
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,120
Scott: after watching this video.

498
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,435
Scott: I think, you know, pole position was made around shortly after this, right?

499
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:15,580
Scott: Like the early 80s, right?

500
00:28:16,221 --> 00:28:21,480
Scott: So it's not a surprise that the pole position would look, you know, the way this video looks.

501
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:26,020
Scott: It makes me want to see if, you know, someone has to have one of these cars still around somewhere.

502
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:29,520
Scott: I want to go see like, you know, a video, a modern video of one.

503
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,921
Rym: Pole position was released in 1982.

504
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:34,860
Scott: Yeah, so this is four years before pole position.

505
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,120
Scott: So I want to see like, you know, this car still has to exist somewhere even though they don't use it in F1 anymore, right?

506
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:47,180
Scott: Someone has one in their garage, some car collectee guy, some auto show or some, you know, classic car, you know, day at the track.

507
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:51,280
Scott: I want to see like a modern video of this old car driving, if I can find one.

508
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:52,544
Rym: All right.

509
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:57,200
Rym: In the meantime, very briefly, we will be at PAX Australia.

510
00:28:57,849 --> 00:28:58,037
Rym: Oi!

511
00:28:58,421 --> 00:28:59,124
Rym: It's official.

512
00:28:59,144 --> 00:29:00,249
Rym: It's done.

513
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,233
Rym: We're doing it.

514
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:02,820
Rym: We are presenting at least one lecture.

515
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:08,260
Rym: We're doing a brand new, rewritten, updated, awesome Beyond Dungeons & Dragons.

516
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,400
Scott: To represent all the indie RPG people who won't go to Australia.

517
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:11,961
Scott: Yup.

518
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,692
Rym: Friday, July 19th in Melbourne at 1 p.m.

519
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:18,400
Rym: in the Wombat Theater.

520
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:24,780
Rym: So we now know the name of at least one of the theaters at PAX Australia.

521
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:27,840
Rym: We're going to be at PAX Dev, hopefully PAX Prime.

522
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,099
Scott: Do they have Wombats in Australia?

523
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,528
Rym: ConnectiCon, Anime Boston.

524
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:32,400
Rym: We're doing five panels in Anime Boston.

525
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:34,480
Scott: Whoa, at least that'll take some time.

526
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,545
Rym: Yup.

527
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,360
Rym: The Book Club book is Player of Games by...

528
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,742
Scott: Ian M. Banks.

529
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:40,010
Scott: I've been reading a lot more of it.

530
00:29:40,553 --> 00:29:41,620
Scott: I'm getting the exciting parts.

531
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,018
Rym: It might be raining the rest of the week and I'll start reading it again, but I've been biking to work every day, so...

532
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:45,880
Scott: It's too cold.

533
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:55,001
Rym: I also realized recently we've done 22 panels and lectures at PAX's since 2008.

534
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:55,458
Rym: That's a lot.

535
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:55,910
Scott: Yup.

536
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,191
Rym: YouTube channels, all their shit's up there.

537
00:29:59,554 --> 00:30:00,218
Rym: Mine and Scott's.

538
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:01,860
Scott: Sure.

539
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,748
Rym: So, RSS.

540
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,211
Rym: Dead.

541
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:04,915
Rym: Dying.

542
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:05,780
Rym: Dying dead.

543
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,237
Scott: It's not... I think it's exactly where it's always been, right?

544
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,480
Rym: Nerds know they're using it, other people use it by accident, but very few people use it on purpose anymore.

545
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:18,340
Scott: Well, very few people ever used it on purpose to begin with.

546
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:25,359
Rym: Yup, but I think the number actually dropped, but basically this whole conversation came out of the fact that Google announced they were killing Google Reader, which...

547
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,125
Scott: Well, that's their philosophy now, right?

548
00:30:27,206 --> 00:30:31,480
Scott: Is more wood behind fewer arrows, so Google Reader is not that popular.

549
00:30:32,422 --> 00:30:42,340
Scott: It's got this sort of, you know, small, you know, not super small, but... A very vocal, very passionate, but relatively small user base compared to other Google products.

550
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:55,520
Rym: According to the internet, Google Reader is the most used software in the history of the world, and Google is killing the most popular and best cash cow they could have ever had.

551
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,680
Scott: It's heavily used by heavy internet users and not at all even known by general people.

552
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:08,914
Rym: Wait, so it's got like Daft Punk music and... So, they're killing it and people are like, "Why?

553
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,239
Rym: Why are they killing

554
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:10,340
Rym: it?".

555
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:14,760
Scott: Well, first of all, the major problem is that there's not really any good alternatives, right?

556
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,859
Scott: All the other RSS readers sort of died.

557
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,879
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, now that actually answers the question in a little way.

558
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:25,840
Rym: There's more than one web browser because a lot of people use web browsers.

559
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:32,600
Rym: Name a thing there's only one of where that thing is popular.

560
00:31:36,178 --> 00:31:36,220
Scott: Um...

561
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:40,640
Rym: Because if something's popular, there's at least going to be one knockoff.

562
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,319
Scott: There's monopolies on things.

563
00:31:45,023 --> 00:31:45,780
Rym: Uh... name one.

564
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,199
Scott: Zippers.

565
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:50,899
Rym: There are other companies that make zippers, they're just cooked slightly so.

566
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,058
Scott: There's very few of them.

567
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:57,719
Rym: Also, zippers, much like RSS, most people don't think about them that much or care about them.

568
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,379
Rym: And there are people who try to... Velcro competes with zippers.

569
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:04,398
Rym: Pretty effectively in some cases.

570
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:07,077
Scott: So do shoelaces.

571
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,283
Rym: Yeah, actually.

572
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:10,719
Rym: Buttons, hooks, key and hook.

573
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:13,160
Rym: I like the key and hook model sometimes.

574
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:15,780
Rym: If you wear a button fly, you're a terrible person.

575
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,980
Rym: That is the worst industrial design in the modern world.

576
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,460
Rym: Because you got to pee, that's dangerous.

577
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,260
Scott: What if it's a fake, what if it's a snap button fly?

578
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:28,980
Rym: That's like wearing a fake tie.

579
00:32:29,728 --> 00:32:30,940
Rym: Like a clip-on tie.

580
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:31,536
Scott: It can work.

581
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,414
Rym: It can work.

582
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:33,777
Scott: No one will know.

583
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,679
Rym: But anyway, think about that, guys.

584
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:47,480
Rym: If Google Reader and RSS are so important to the internet and so popular, why hasn't someone made a super awesome or even just a knockoff of Google Reader and charged like 50 cents for it?

585
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,156
Scott: Well, I think this Feedly is out there, I guess.

586
00:32:50,418 --> 00:32:50,720
Scott: I don't know.

587
00:32:50,941 --> 00:32:53,856
Rym: But accordingly, if you listen to Google Reader people, it's not good enough.

588
00:32:53,876 --> 00:32:54,620
Rym: It's not even close.

589
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,486
Scott: Right.

590
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:56,400
Scott: Well, here's the whole thing.

591
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:58,900
Scott: What is RSS originally all about?

592
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:16,620
Scott: It was all about syndicating content so that one person could customize and make their own aggregator by combining content from a bunch of different websites, mostly blogs originally, but now also any other site that has items of content, individual items.

593
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:21,960
Scott: Look at them all in one place without having to actually visit those individual places.

594
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:27,480
Scott: And consume a lot of content very, very quickly and easily.

595
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:36,059
Rym: You said a bunch of keywords that tell everyone why there's not a lot of industry support for RSS, especially content in RSS.

596
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,160
Scott: People who make content for money and have ads don't want you to do this.

597
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,540
Rym: You already said aggregator.

598
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:51,680
Rym: Everyone who isn't Google hates Google News if they have news, because Google News, people don't even click through to read the news articles.

599
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:54,559
Rym: Google News in the summary, not many people do.

600
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:00,540
Rym: And Google News won't link to places that have paywalls or anything in the way.

601
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,980
Rym: So Google News is basically funneling people toward free sources of the news that they'd rather you pay for.

602
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,934
Rym: And a lot of people, I don't click on every news.

603
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:16,900
Rym: I go to Google News, I read the headlines to know the facts and things that are happening, but then I only click on one article when I want to go in depth.

604
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,399
Scott: That's true.

605
00:34:17,982 --> 00:34:23,900
Rym: So all those other people feel like Google is stealing revenue from them because I didn't click through and see the ad.

606
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,340
Rym: There's no way they would let Google show the entire article in Google News.

607
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:37,340
Rym: So aggregators are bad for people who care about that business model and make content that they don't want aggregated.

608
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:41,900
Scott: So the people who make the content have an incentive to not have RSS in the first place.

609
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:50,018
Rym: I mean, do you ever wonder why Penny Arcade, pretty much the most popular web comic in the history of web comics, doesn't have the comic itself in the RSS feed?

610
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,590
Rym: They didn't for the longest time.

611
00:34:52,953 --> 00:34:54,040
Rym: People complained about it.

612
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,139
Rym: They might now because of that Kickstarter.

613
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,420
Scott: I think Robert Koo even, I'm not sure if he said this, but I seem to remember, he didn't really care about people putting the comics up all over the internet.

614
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,732
Scott: He just didn't want you to hot link and use all their bandwidth.

615
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:06,859
Scott: He was like, "Use Imgur, guys.

616
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:07,019
Rym: Come

617
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,080
Rym: on.".

618
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,100
Rym: Yeah, but there was a time where the comic was definitely not in the RSS feed.

619
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:19,700
Rym: And almost every web comic I click through on RSS feeds right now, as I've been clicking through recently, do not have the actual comics in the RSS feed.

620
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,560
Scott: Some of that is technological incompetence.

621
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:35,080
Rym: They tell you the comic is there, but the link is to the site with the ad banners that has the comic, which isn't great when I'm on the subway and I have my RSS reader and I want to just read all my web comics.

622
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,120
Rym: Nope, got to be online.

623
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:45,840
Scott: The other thing is that big content houses really want to track your reading content, and they do a lot of things to put cookies on you that they make money from.

624
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,480
Scott: And if you're just getting stuff from the RSS feed, none of that stuff works.

625
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:54,192
Scott: They can't really put ads in RSS effectively.

626
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:56,120
Scott: There's no way for them to make any money off of you.

627
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,960
Rym: RSS is great design in the sense that I, as a person using the internet, want data.

628
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,060
Rym: I just want the pipe of the data I want formatted for me, but a lot of data that's on the internet I don't care about.

629
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,048
Rym: I don't want to see your ad.

630
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:09,380
Rym: I just want to see your funny image.

631
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:13,760
Rym: So I want to display just the image and not the ad, but they don't like that.

632
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:22,520
Scott: The other thing is that so few people actually use the RSS that you don't lose a lot of readers if you get rid of it.

633
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,860
Rym: Exactly, because say there was an RSS feed that had the full comments.

634
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,819
Rym: Well, I guess you couldn't have the comments, but the summaries and everything of Slashdot, and I used it.

635
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:35,179
Rym: If that RSS feed went away, I'd probably just start going to Slashdot again.

636
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,379
Scott: Yeah, right?

637
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:43,619
Rym: Yeah, but I don't use RSS anyway because most of the sites I go to don't have enough content in the RSS feeds to make it worth it.

638
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:54,780
Rym: So the only place I use RSS is podcasts, which are also completely plateaued and not well-known or popular, except among, again, the kinds of people who use Google Reader.

639
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,615
Scott: I think there are a few podcasts that are sort of growing.

640
00:36:59,421 --> 00:37:03,580
Scott: A lot of the NPR stuff, just tons and tons of people are all over that shit.

641
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:10,180
Rym: But a lot of those people just go to the website and then they click on the player and listen while they're at work.

642
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,019
Scott: That could be, yeah.

643
00:37:11,301 --> 00:37:13,860
Rym: Or they use iTunes to listen.

644
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:14,259
Scott: Yep.

645
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,794
Rym: They don't know they're using RSS.

646
00:37:15,814 --> 00:37:16,420
Rym: They don't care.

647
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,998
Scott: Well, actually iTunes is using the RSS and then their iTunes is using iTunes.

648
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,790
Rym: Exactly, but they don't care that it's RSS.

649
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,159
Rym: It doesn't have to be RSS.

650
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,788
Scott: Well, that's the best.

651
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:26,240
Scott: RSS is the one you don't see, right?

652
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,469
Scott: Exactly.

653
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:33,820
Rym: But the RSS that's invisible is also the RSS that lets people consume your content without ever going to your site.

654
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,280
Scott: Right.

655
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,996
Scott: Well, I mean, look, Firefox, when RSS was bigger, they added that built-in RSS.

656
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,440
Scott: You would visit a website and if it had an RSS, the orange icon would appear.

657
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,280
Scott: They tried to push that orange icon everywhere.

658
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:51,800
Scott: And Firefox got rid of that orange icon because no one really clicked on it and it was cluttering up the interface.

659
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,360
Rym: Yeah.

660
00:37:52,921 --> 00:38:04,200
Rym: So the problem is just that there is technology like RSS that is great for users but bad for people who have control over and say on industries.

661
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:10,620
Rym: As a result, there's no industry support or lax industry support for those protocols.

662
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:16,120
Rym: Usually, eventually, proprietary protocols that are a little more locked down come in and compete with them.

663
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:19,580
Rym: And the only people who get mad are super internet people.

664
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:27,800
Rym: I mean, I ran into this problem five years ago and stopped using RSS feeds because I couldn't get the data I wanted in the RSS feeds.

665
00:38:28,663 --> 00:38:31,160
Rym: And I had the separate kind of side problem with aggregators.

666
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,800
Rym: Use RSS to subscribe to content.

667
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:42,880
Rym: If I subscribe to more than one aggregator, there is so much duplicated content, pretty much immediately that RSS becomes useless.

668
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,540
Rym: I'd rather just go to the best aggregator.

669
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,200
Scott: Exactly.

670
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,167
Scott: You want to get tech news, right?

671
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:56,300
Scott: So let's say you get Engadget, you get Gizmodo, you get Slashtite, you get Ars Technica, you get, I don't know who else, right?

672
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:59,860
Scott: Maybe you get some subreddits about technology, you put them all together.

673
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:00,778
Scott: You know what you're going to see?

674
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,720
Scott: You're going to see the same story, the same SISPA story like ten times.

675
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
Scott: It's like that's not helpful.

676
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,159
Scott: I want to see the one SISPA story.

677
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,500
Scott: I want to see every individual thing once and only once with no things missing.

678
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,660
Scott: And that is not a solved problem.

679
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:16,180
Scott: Not even Google solved that problem.

680
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:20,019
Rym: So my answer is to choose the best aggregator and use it.

681
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:37,680
Scott: Yeah, now if Google had decided to, instead of kill Google Reader, enhance it by adding those kinds of features and things, you know, where it would take, you know, of all your feeds, it would be able to detect similar stories using the same thing it does with Google News to detect similar stories and clump them together.

682
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:39,636
Scott: Then it would have been amazing.

683
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,120
Rym: So here's the question.

684
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:42,280
Rym: Why didn't Google do that?

685
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,840
Scott: Because they don't make any money from Google Reader.

686
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:44,379
Rym: Yup.

687
00:39:45,000 --> 00:40:06,840
Rym: And at best, the best case scenario for Google Reader, if it doesn't piss off advertisers and content producers and they get away to put the ads in line in such a way that it works, is that they have the same ad revenue they had before and had to do a whole bunch of work to get to that point, as opposed to let it die and also have the same ad revenue.

688
00:40:08,345 --> 00:40:09,038
Scott: That's pretty much it.

689
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:15,120
Rym: But it's interesting that, you know, a lot of people say, oh, the open source movement, open source software, make your own.

690
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:19,740
Rym: It's interesting that no one's really making one that looks like it's going to replace Google.

691
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,242
Scott: Right.

692
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:21,480
Scott: I mean, there's tons of them out there.

693
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,939
Scott: They're just not good.

694
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:26,246
Rym: And this is not the people who are going to write.

695
00:40:26,306 --> 00:40:32,477
Scott: the whole point of RSS is to increase efficiency, but to increase efficiency, you need an excellent user interface.

696
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:34,440
Scott: that has to be like perfect and amazing.

697
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,300
Scott: You know, if something that someone's going to use all day and funnel all their Internet through, that's a heavy use program.

698
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:39,879
Scott: It's got to be.

699
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:40,427
Rym: I got one.

700
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,280
Rym: It's called a web browser.

701
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:42,480
Scott: It has to be terrific.

702
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,609
Scott: And it's so far no one's really made one.

703
00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:48,820
Scott: that's better than open up a bunch of websites and tabs and scroll down them.

704
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:50,163
Scott: Right.

705
00:40:50,707 --> 00:40:52,440
Rym: So it's not a bad way to go, though.

706
00:40:52,823 --> 00:40:53,228
Scott: It's not.

707
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:54,060
Scott: It's pretty efficient.

708
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:57,300
Scott: So it's really hard to beat that level of efficiency.

709
00:40:57,864 --> 00:40:59,100
Scott: You know, the way Google Reader did.

710
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,263
Rym: You know, there was kind of a side thing.

711
00:41:00,303 --> 00:41:07,160
Rym: I noticed that when I first started using Google Reader way back, it was great because it would queue up like all these things to look at.

712
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:15,880
Rym: And I know when I looked at them, but even only subscribe to a small amount of things, readers queue was faster than I was willing to consume the data.

713
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:26,400
Rym: And no software email, nothing to date, has a good way to drop things off your queue that you probably weren't ever going to actually look at.

714
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,549
Scott: How is it supposed to know?

715
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,436
Scott: Get an A.I.

716
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:28,900
Scott: agent?

717
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,958
Scott: Basically what you do.

718
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,490
Scott: Give it some years.

719
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,960
Scott: Give it some years.

720
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,279
Rym: No, actually, it's pretty easy to do.

721
00:41:33,662 --> 00:41:35,580
Rym: I deal with this problem in the financial industry all the time.

722
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,400
Rym: It's the simplest way to do it that works well in like 90 percent of use cases is to have data expire.

723
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:44,156
Rym: So something new hits your RSS reader.

724
00:41:44,257 --> 00:41:44,619
Rym: It's there.

725
00:41:45,942 --> 00:41:52,440
Rym: If it's still in your queue after three days, it just disappears if there is more stuff in your queue to replace it.

726
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,479
Rym: So fresh news over about, say, three days is replacing news you didn't look at.

727
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:02,319
Rym: So if you don't look at it for a week and then you look at it, you only see the fresh stuff.

728
00:42:02,702 --> 00:42:03,608
Scott: Now here's the thing, right?

729
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:05,420
Scott: See, there's a whole bunch of weird special cases.

730
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,820
Scott: This is why this shit is hard and it's not easy, right?

731
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:10,560
Scott: Let's say you subscribe to a whole bunch of stuff.

732
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,960
Scott: You subscribe to like Engadgets and SlashTots, but you also subscribe to like Obscure Blog or a webcomic that updates once.

733
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,038
Rym: Ah, that's a separate thing.

734
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,980
Scott: You know, your prior Bible fellowship is in there, right?

735
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,480
Rym: It's got QOS handles that, priority tiers.

736
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,420
Scott: You don't want a Perry Bible fellowship to expire, right?

737
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,776
Scott: It gets in there when you're on vacation and then...

738
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,180
Rym: So priority tiers, you set it up to where, like here's in the financial world, here's the situation.

739
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,320
Rym: Here's the same situation, a legit example.

740
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,819
Rym: You send a 35 equals D. That's a new order.

741
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:40,920
Rym: 35 equals F cancels some fucking order.

742
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:55,020
Rym: Let's say you're trading on some exchange somewhere that will only accept 20 order affecting messages per second from you because that's how they limit you.

743
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,960
Rym: You can only send 20 orders and/or cancels per second.

744
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,940
Rym: Let's say I have a routing engine or something that's taking in all my orders and sending them to the exchange.

745
00:43:06,821 --> 00:43:10,476
Rym: Let's say I know I'm about to send that 21st order.

746
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,519
Rym: Do I reject it back to whatever sent it?

747
00:43:16,102 --> 00:43:18,860
Rym: Do I hold it and then send it when the rate gets under a threshold?

748
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:22,119
Rym: How long do I hold it?

749
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,300
Rym: If I hold on to it for 20 milliseconds and then send it because it was just a burst, that's probably fine.

750
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,179
Rym: If I hold on to it for 20 seconds, it's probably bad news.

751
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,800
Rym: Let's say I'm at my threshold and I'm queuing up some orders, but I'm still sending through.

752
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:39,603
Rym: At what point.

753
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:43,620
Rym: do I want to send through fresh orders and reject old orders that I couldn't send in time?

754
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:47,520
Rym: Do I want to prioritize cancels over new orders?

755
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:59,460
Rym: You can see how even in a simple thing where there are just two cases, an order and a cancel and a rate, the edge cases, I could spend a week, I did spend a week, speccing out the use cases.

756
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:10,457
Rym: Something so much more complex and subjective than just this is an order, this is a cancel, how the hell do you satisfy even 80% of the people?

757
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:12,406
Scott: I don't know.

758
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,160
Scott: If I knew, I'd already be doing it.

759
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:23,180
Rym: But really that's why RSS, and yes it is dying, you guys say it isn't, but at best it has plateaued for the last five years.

760
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:34,460
Rym: It's not commonly used, it's going to have a decreasing user base over time, much like how Futurama was cancelled because no one cares about it anymore, and yes it was cancelled, there's no more seasons coming.

761
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,720
Rym: RSS readers, nothing that comes out to replace Google Reader will satisfy you.

762
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:51,819
Rym: The use cases are too complex, it's too monumental of a project to make something that will satisfy 80% of users, and the content producers don't want one so they're not going to help you.

763
00:44:52,821 --> 00:44:54,979
Rym: The aggregators don't want one, they're not going to help you.

764
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:57,198
Rym: No industry is going to help you.

765
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:07,254
Rym: So you, open source dude, have to make it on your own for no money, and it's impossible for you to satisfy 80% of people.

766
00:45:07,314 --> 00:45:12,340
Rym: so nothing will get critical mass, and you'll have a declining user base even if you do a really good job.

767
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,780
Rym: That's why for the foreseeable future, RSS is dying.

768
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,230
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

769
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:29,370
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

770
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:34,770
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

771
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,710
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

772
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:42,450
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

774
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,230
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

775
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,410
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

776
00:46:37,365 --> 00:46:37,467
Rym: Hey!

777
00:46:39,902 --> 00:46:40,025
Rym: Hey!

778
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,106
Rym: Hey!

779
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:45,866
Rym: Hey!
