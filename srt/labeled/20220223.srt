1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,210
Rym: It's Wednesday February 23rd 2022.

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,658
Rym: I'm Rym Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:17,400
Rym: We are reviewing.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,045
Rym: Mamoru hosted us 2021 film Bell.

5
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:23,107
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:30,917
Rym: So a classic a trope on GeekNights like if there's a TV tropes page about GeekNights What are the things that we list?

7
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:31,784
Scott: someone did make one?

8
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:32,630
Scott: I don't know if it's still there.

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,820
Scott: Oh, I hold it is.

10
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:46,889
Rym: look it up while we're talking But I feel like one of the things that would go there is Us saying one or two things either warm today or the inverse of that and The reference of which are stolen from both of which is stolen.

11
00:00:48,254 --> 00:00:51,301
Rym: Almost every joke we have is stolen But it was.

12
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:58,816
Rym: it was warm today To a degree that I'm mad about because if I'd known it was gonna be this warm I would have fucking taken today off work.

13
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:07,110
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know 66 degrees Fahrenheit is Not what I would say is like really warm.

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:14,372
Scott: It's not beef time 66 degrees Fahrenheit, but on February 23rd Right.

15
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:14,633
Scott: Oh

16
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:20,247
Rym: February 23rd when it was like snowing a few days before that and I was the

17
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:25,909
Scott: last time I went Outside I was touched by snowflakes falling from the sky at least a few of them

18
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:34,561
Rym: Yeah, and then tonight it's gonna be freezing cold again Like Rapidly like a cold front's gonna come in and ruin this right

19
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:41,726
Scott: and now yeah, but like in the morning when I woke up You know, the sky was overcast and then in the afternoon the Sun was hurting my eyes again.

20
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:44,295
Rym: Yeah It's.

21
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:46,439
Rym: uh The problem is what I need.

22
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:56,283
Scott: meanwhile while it was and you know It was 66 in New York City at that exact moment our friends in Albany It was 36 a 30 Fahrenheit degree difference.

23
00:01:56,504 --> 00:02:03,845
Rym: in that short of a distance There's gonna be a 30 degree Fahrenheit distance for us between today at around 1 p.m.

24
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:05,329
Rym: And four hours from now.

25
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:10,729
Scott: Yep, I guess we must be on like the edge of some pressure system.

26
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,926
Rym: Yep Oh, you hear that wind just like rising and rising outside over the last hour.

27
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:17,689
Scott: There's a noise cancelling headphones now.

28
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:25,350
Rym: Well, yeah The windows open but that led to another problem because the dirt bikes found out that it was warm.

29
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:26,423
Rym: I guess someone told them.

30
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:38,117
Rym: What I heard out the window a little while ago was the loudest dirt biking I've ever heard Outside of when DMX died and there was that procession Mmm, but they eventually left.

31
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:41,270
Rym: I think they got over the Queensboro Bridge, so they're gone at least for now.

32
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:47,167
Rym: Okay, but the worst is if it stays cold, I'm fine cuz I can go ski.

33
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,078
Rym: if it stays warm I'm fine biking and all the other sports I do.

34
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:56,010
Rym: but when it's in between the two or flipping back and forth I can't do anything Like if the weather if I know the weather shitty.

35
00:02:56,452 --> 00:02:59,950
Rym: Well, like play a board game or I'll like plan to play Civ for six hours.

36
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:03,750
Rym: But I'm in this like period where I can't actually plan anything.

37
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:07,830
Rym: So I waste a day like this working and then it'll be like a shitty day tomorrow.

38
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:11,144
Rym: but I didn't make a plan to do something with that time.

39
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:14,519
Rym: and yeah We're just old men ranting about the weather.

40
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:18,586
Rym: That's what happens when we do a podcast for 16 years give or take Mm-hmm.

41
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,890
Rym: So in the news we got to talk about this verse.

42
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,766
Rym: It's not anime related or comic related or anything, but it happened today and it's real bad.

43
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:30,269
Rym: So we have to talk about it.

44
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:38,654
Rym: We cannot cover this in a lot of detail nor should we because you should go read real reporting about this and do whatever it Is you're gonna do.

45
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:41,229
Rym: the governor of Texas today?

46
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:47,690
Scott: Basically issued an order saying that I thought it was a law that the Texas legislature passed.

47
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,717
Rym: No, the Texas governor ordered this.

48
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:51,743
Scott: he ordered all state different.

49
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:52,927
Scott: that's different from what I thought.

50
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:53,650
Scott: so I thought wrong.

51
00:03:53,941 --> 00:04:08,685
Rym: Yep so basically what the Texas governor ordered is that all gender affirming care or even the recognition of a gender that's different from quote Sexuality which is we all know that we all know that is the gradient.

52
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:10,090
Rym: people who don't believe that are just wrong.

53
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:19,045
Scott: Basically said that affirming that or recognizing that is child abuse That a doctor is a governor have the power to do this by order in Texas.

54
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:22,070
Rym: Yes Texas is a real.

55
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:24,837
Rym: Texas is a real fucked up state.

56
00:04:25,218 --> 00:04:32,009
Rym: governors in America have broad powers and in Texas governors have extraordinarily broad powers.

57
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:39,450
Rym: Okay, I remember Texas is a state that literally cut itself off from the rest of North America's power grid.

58
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:48,635
Rym: There are exactly four like interconnects for electricity in all of North America once Quebec For reasons you can imagine.

59
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:54,970
Rym: two of them are the United States and the fourth one is just Texas by itself.

60
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:59,684
Rym: They did this on purpose for terrible reasons and this goes further.

61
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:07,310
Rym: It also requires Anyone who encounters a child who expresses trans identity in any way?

62
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:12,230
Rym: Should that has to be reported so that their parents can be investigated for child abuse.

63
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:13,747
Scott: What if you don't report it?

64
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,054
Scott: That's that you could be prosecuted for endangering a child even though there's no that even though there's no law It's just an order.

65
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:24,307
Rym: basically the the best way I can describe you.

66
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:29,840
Scott: when you go to court The lawyer is gonna be like, yes They broke government order from the governor as opposed to so

67
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:40,421
Rym: it's basically the attorney like the Attorney General Of the state that the equivalent of the Department of Justice of the state are all saying This is how we interpret the law.

68
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:43,212
Rym: This is how we'll prosecute these things Uh-huh.

69
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:43,593
Scott: So what?

70
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:48,270
Scott: but I guess they're just counting it as child abuse as they have an existing child abuse law.

71
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:48,993
Scott: And that's what.

72
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:53,110
Rym: that's basically what they're doing and there's a lot of details and nuance that I'm skipping over.

73
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,706
Scott: I guess there's gonna be some court fights saying well, here's the problem.

74
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:04,965
Rym: the Anything like this will eventually go to the Supreme Court, which has been extremely Not on the side of justice, especially around issues lately.

75
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:10,883
Rym: I would argue the Supreme Court is literally illegitimate right now based on how it's progressed.

76
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:19,230
Rym: So we can't rely on the courts and Texas it might not make it to the Supreme Court, you know, yeah Well, we'll see how this goes.

77
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:25,270
Rym: But this like this is a rapidly evolving fucked up an extremely dangerous situation for kids in Texas.

78
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:28,148
Rym: The good news one little glimmer of hope.

79
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:41,309
Rym: multiple County legislators People in different levels of police in various parts of the state mayors Have one by one made statements basically publicly saying they will refuse to follow this order.

80
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:45,183
Scott: But I mean there's even in the reddest of states, right?

81
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:47,150
Scott: There's the places where the people live.

82
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:52,788
Rym: It's pretty much only blue places in Texas which are doing this which is very obviously.

83
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:56,486
Rym: Yeah So, uh, this is breaking like news.

84
00:06:56,526 --> 00:06:57,190
Rym: that's gonna progress.

85
00:06:57,371 --> 00:07:03,706
Rym: But the only thing I want to point out that I think you should all internalize because I realize and I tweet about this a lot, but you shouldn't read my Twitter.

86
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:19,509
Rym: my Twitter is like 50% me screaming about politics 20% weird skeletons and the rest is like pictures of rabbits, but basically the all those photos you see from Nazi Germany like Nazi Germany like all those book burnings.

87
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:35,565
Rym: a Big percentage of those book burnings were actually from a specific incident where the Nazis went and burned all the LGBT resources in this one Institute and Very few people who use those photos talk about what was actually being burned.

88
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,450
Rym: They talk about oh the Nazis burned books.

89
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:46,170
Rym: They don't point out that the Nazis actually went after the LGBT community Hardest and first in terms of direct actions that they took against them as a community.

90
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:54,736
Rym: So Use that knowledge as you See fit and honestly treat 19 treat 2022 like it's 1922 and do whatever it is.

91
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:55,337
Rym: You need to do.

92
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,118
Rym: Also leave Texas if you can.

93
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:01,961
Rym: a lot of people can't.

94
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:05,634
Scott: I mean, you know if you can but you know It's if you have a business.

95
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:06,378
Scott: don't do business.

96
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:11,238
Rym: Oh, yeah, if you can boycott the state of Texas, absolutely We need to treat it like a failed state.

97
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:14,189
Scott: that's in Texas, you know, if you go on like, I don't know.

98
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:15,474
Rym: I mean I was already.

99
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:21,830
Scott: if you're shopping online and you see like something you want to buy look and see if it's from like Us maybe it's an Etsy or something, right?

100
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,418
Scott: You can usually see where the Etsy person is from.

101
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,123
Scott: if they're from Texas don't buy from them.

102
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:27,367
Rym: Yeah, it's not.

103
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:30,110
Rym: it's rough though Because a lot of people are trapped there.

104
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:39,176
Rym: So just follow the news find figure out like I'm trying to figure out exactly what charities to donate to that love the most impact And we'll see what happens.

105
00:08:40,080 --> 00:09:03,590
Scott: I mean, you know, that's the story of pretty much all Suffering right is you know, someone is lives within political borders that you know, do not align You know with them right and it you know ranging from you know like Texas to like, you know, Uyghurs in China or You know a gay person in Russia, right?

106
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:10,970
Scott: It's like, you know You people are stuck living in a place then the politics of that place or not are not good for them.

107
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:16,250
Rym: And the worst part is Because of the way the United States is structured.

108
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:21,945
Rym: There's almost nothing we can do to stop this from outside of Texas.

109
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:38,436
Rym: nor can people within Texas effectively stop it short of civil disobedience and mass protests and drastic like extra legal actions partly because the only way to actually stop this legally would be a federal law or Supreme Court ruling and Electing a different governor of Texas.

110
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:42,350
Rym: Yep, which is difficult because we didn't pass the Voting Rights Act.

111
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,233
Rym: So Texas is.

112
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:52,772
Rym: the vote is so suppressed in Texas that even if the majority of Texans disagree with this It would be very difficult to displace this governor Mm-hmm.

113
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,201
Rym: And yeah, I I don't know what to do about it.

114
00:09:56,602 --> 00:10:03,370
Scott: I'd just keep an eye on this one because the Republican You know you do what you can do, but you know, you're ultimately.

115
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:04,954
Scott: You know one person.

116
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:13,858
Scott: you can't what can one person do something but you know a collective action can do more and then What can you do more than that?

117
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,690
Rym: Not much but mark my words and mark the words of activists.

118
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:18,430
Rym: This isn't an isolated incident.

119
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,786
Rym: Texas is for the Republican Party of America the incubator of.

120
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:27,339
Rym: basically the idea Is that about every?

121
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:31,810
Scott: no actually they pretty much all all the red states are incubator.

122
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,929
Scott: They're trying everything everywhere to see what works.

123
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:42,170
Rym: It's more that Texas in particular is the model because remember Texas is the state where they took control of the textbook industry.

124
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:47,685
Rym: Texas is a large state that has to suppress going in Florida.

125
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:49,170
Scott: They got stuff going everywhere.

126
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,890
Rym: Yeah, but Texas is a state that if the vote weren't suppressed could be blue.

127
00:10:54,411 --> 00:11:00,430
Rym: That's why it's often the incubator because that is a test of how far can they push it in a place?

128
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,903
Rym: That isn't just completely controlled by the Republicans.

129
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:04,370
Rym: How far can they push voters?

130
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:09,190
Scott: Even like the red estate like what fucking Idaho or something?

131
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,814
Rym: Oh West Virginia might actually be.

132
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:13,645
Rym: West Virginia is also the whitest state 97% white.

133
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:14,609
Rym: last I'd look that up.

134
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:17,699
Scott: Right, but what percentage there's still?

135
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:22,731
Scott: probably like what 30 40 percent blueness even It's.

136
00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:25,175
Rym: I mean that I don't want to derail this to another.

137
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:27,280
Rym: we we could do a Thursday show on this if you want to.

138
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:30,727
Scott: I'm just saying there's people who are stuck there.

139
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:31,770
Scott: That's that was the point.

140
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:39,320
Rym: Oh, there's people stuck everywhere, but Texas now is People and materially dangerous to trans children.

141
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:47,440
Rym: Yep So, uh not to you know, it's tough to talk about something like that and then just get on with the newscast.

142
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:52,367
Rym: So I don't want to just pull a so anyway in the news but just really don't.

143
00:11:52,428 --> 00:12:02,819
Rym: don't let this one slide like pay attention to that one and Don't go if if we're the first people you heard about this from I Don't know subscribe to like one more person on Twitter or something like Jesus.

144
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:10,431
Rym: So, uh, I guess in other news There is comics news.

145
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:12,040
Rym: That is bad.

146
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,007
Rym: Comixology has basically been destroyed by Amazon.

147
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:15,428
Rym: like.

148
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:19,400
Scott: well Comixology was bought by Amazon a long time ago, right?

149
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,670
Scott: So Comixology was sort of like the.

150
00:12:21,972 --> 00:12:29,403
Scott: it wasn't the first ever I don't think but it was basically the biggest and strongest digital comics Seller.

151
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:37,645
Scott: right sort of like I guess, you know the Spotify or Netflix of comic books in the in the US You know and you could see.

152
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:42,080
Scott: you could subscribe to various comics to get them in digital ebook form legally.

153
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:53,929
Scott: You know the prices were you know in sort of this in-between spot of not being so ridiculously inexpensive that it was a no-brainer But not being so expensive that it was like a ripoff.

154
00:12:54,090 --> 00:13:05,389
Rym: but above everything the experience like a Lot of people have tried to make comics readable in digital form with technology a lot of factors in play there But different kinds of comics right?

155
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,699
Scott: That's the reason I have like this huge shelves behind me.

156
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,553
Scott: Yeah is because this you know.

157
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:21,911
Scott: a lot of comics You know have different formats especially ones that were made in the print era before digital comics were a thing and It's like there isn't even though it's just a 2d image.

158
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:30,000
Scott: there really isn't a way To present, you know the comic in a digital form.

159
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:35,920
Scott: It's like yeah taking a movie and making it an MPEG instead of film as long as the resolutions high enough.

160
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,696
Scott: It's like, you know, right a mp3 versus a CD.

161
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:52,535
Scott: It's like yeah, okay yeah, but if you just scan in even with the highest resolution scanner and make a JPEG out of a two-page spread in a book, you know, it's not the same.

162
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:54,020
Scott: It's actually not the same.

163
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:59,200
Scott: It's like one of the few Mediums of art where it's like I guess sculpture would be another one.

164
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:07,456
Scott: It's like yeah looking at a 3d model of a sculpture versus going to the sculpture physically where you can touch It is not the same if they let you touch it.

165
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:16,845
Scott: Yeah There's some mediums of art that transform to digital with fine and there are some that don't and comics is one of them Above all else.

166
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:18,111
Rym: what comic solos you got?

167
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:23,273
Rym: absolutely right is their reader Was one of the best like it were right.

168
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:27,140
Rym: so well, I've read I mean down the comics on that thing over the years.

169
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:38,960
Scott: The only way that they could really compete with things like piracy of comics Which is real easy to do you can just download tour instead of like every Marvel comic that came out this month.

170
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:43,239
Scott: Right every month someone puts that together from scanning and whatnot.

171
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:59,066
Scott: The only way they could compete and actually sell digital comics was you know, they made software that provided wasn't perfect But it was still probably the world's premier and best digital comic reading Software across platforms.

172
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:04,860
Rym: and when Amazon bought it that kept working just fine until very recently.

173
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:13,960
Scott: Amazon was doing a weird thing where it's like if you went to amazon.com and look for a comic it would you could like Buy it on Kindle and comics ology, right?

174
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,640
Scott: It was like the same purchase like, you know, there's like a manga that was on boat.

175
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:18,020
Scott: You know It.

176
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,029
Scott: just say buy on Kindle and comics ology six bucks.

177
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:26,384
Scott: you buy it and then you could now read it in the comics ology App or on your Kindle.

178
00:15:26,544 --> 00:15:33,524
Scott: Yeah, I guess if you're reading a normal format black and white manga, that's actually pretty nice to Kindle paper.

179
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,660
Rym: why it's pretty in the paper way for a simple black and white comic.

180
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:44,725
Scott: But if you're gonna read a Marvel superhero full-color x-men, you know 24 page issue Kindle's not gonna cut it.

181
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:48,420
Scott: the Kindle app on your computer isn't gonna cut it.

182
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,379
Scott: No, the Kindle app in a browser on your iPad isn't gonna cut it.

183
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,100
Rym: But the comics ology reader did a pretty damn good job.

184
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:58,572
Scott: Ology reader was the best that you were gonna get.

185
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:00,320
Scott: but you know time went on.

186
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,130
Scott: I think you I feel like it's been years since Amazon bought them.

187
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:04,997
Scott: Yeah, and Amazon's pretty much like.

188
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:07,325
Scott: alright That's enough of that comics ology biz.

189
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,232
Scott: Let's bring it all into the Kindle zone.

190
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:11,560
Scott: Are they even gonna keep the brand comics ology?

191
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,958
Scott: It's like, you know, yeah, I don't even know.

192
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:15,480
Rym: Happen here.

193
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,720
Rym: But the thing that people are reacting to the strongest is that the reader that replaced it doesn't fucking work.

194
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:23,953
Rym: Like you can't read comics in this thing.

195
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:32,310
Rym: Like it is broken I if you're watching the stream like I'm looking at House of M right now, which I was reading so I had it in my Library, uh, you can't zoom.

196
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:33,817
Rym: you can't zoom in and out.

197
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:34,420
Rym: it done.

198
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,544
Rym: It's non reactive.

199
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,333
Rym: if you try to zoom it like changes pages.

200
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:42,730
Rym: if you force zoom with the browser You don't actually get a quality increase.

201
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:43,855
Rym: It just zooms in.

202
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,585
Rym: unlike these it's Unusable garbage.

203
00:16:47,187 --> 00:16:49,173
Rym: Yeah, I literally cannot read these comics now.

204
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,419
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know the Like look at this.

205
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,399
Scott: Yeah, I mean this is the reason that I buy.

206
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:59,517
Rym: You know, even though I'm doing it notice how it's not fucking doing anything.

207
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:07,200
Scott: and now suddenly I'm said I buy a lot of comics on paper because even the Kindle even the comics ology app was not perfect.

208
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:11,339
Scott: But this new thing is like this enormous step backwards.

209
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,459
Scott: It's complete trash compared to the original comics ology app as it was.

210
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:22,039
Scott: so I guess Amazon just really doesn't want people to buy those comics digitally anymore.

211
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,490
Scott: and The company's publishing those comics, right?

212
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,255
Scott: I guess Marvel DC.

213
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:33,496
Rym: Oh if I was a comic author I would not even want my comics to be on this platform if that's the experience right.

214
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:38,380
Scott: and like the publishers though It's like, you know Marvel is like, you know, they're okay with this move.

215
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:46,202
Scott: It's like those people who were bought paying money for legal digital comics when they could have pirated Right.

216
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:48,049
Scott: Are they gonna now go to the?

217
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,520
Scott: they're not gonna keep paying if the app is this garbage, right?

218
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,672
Scott: First of all, how many are gonna stick with it?

219
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:54,879
Scott: I can't imagine that many.

220
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:57,668
Scott: How many are gonna go and buy paper comics?

221
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,253
Scott: can't imagine that many.

222
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:01,960
Rym: so here's the question was this insult It?

223
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:04,868
Rym: was there some intentional reason to make it a worse experience?

224
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,796
Rym: or is Amazon just actually that incompetent.

225
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,585
Scott: I Don't know.

226
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:10,959
Scott: I guess it's such a small.

227
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,220
Scott: It's one of those things where it's so insignificant compared to their larger business that they just don't care.

228
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,340
Rym: They've got like the weakest product manager and like the C team of engineers on it like right.

229
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:21,922
Scott: It's like the.

230
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:25,995
Scott: you know, the decision-making power came from some brand people who are like we all.

231
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,420
Scott: we bought this comics ology thing.

232
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,109
Scott: We got to integrate it with the Kindle thing.

233
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:31,040
Scott: get that comics ology out of here, right?

234
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,099
Scott: They're just making some brand level decision and then you know, they want to like.

235
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,312
Scott: oh Why are we paying all these people to work on this comics ology app?

236
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:40,440
Scott: We got a Kindle app at already, right?

237
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,832
Scott: Why let's just you know merge people get rid of.

238
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,240
Scott: people say, you know save money.

239
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,163
Scott: They're not thinking about.

240
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,612
Scott: you know, the the details down there.

241
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:53,320
Rym: Oh and the other big change that many of you Just my guess based on what I know about there is another big change.

242
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:56,560
Rym: It's uh, but it didn't affect us, but I only found about it from reporting.

243
00:18:57,364 --> 00:19:00,160
Rym: All the subscription stuff is no longer available outside of the US.

244
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,789
Rym: Yep, US only I think a lot of it is.

245
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,680
Scott: you might get rid of the subscription parts actually entirely.

246
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:07,864
Rym: I feel like they will.

247
00:19:08,306 --> 00:19:12,180
Scott: they're just gonna make it individual by which is all I've ever done was individual.

248
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,822
Rym: Yeah, Amazon has never liked subscriptions like even for like shows that have like ongoing seasons Like they.

249
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:24,355
Rym: they always made it a confusing mess and they and I never make it easy for you to just say Give me all the Steven universe as it comes out.

250
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:25,160
Rym: Like they'd always kind of fun.

251
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,053
Scott: Yeah, it's like I'm reading I'm buying every volume of Chainsaw Man.

252
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:40,051
Scott: I have bought legally on Kindle And I have to remember like when a new one's out and go find it and click buy with one click or whatever And it sends it to my Kindle.

253
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:40,474
Scott: Yeah.

254
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:41,118
Scott: Yeah.

255
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:47,869
Rym: So, uh, yeah, the worst thing is this is the kind of episode we would say Hey, so you should use this instead as far as I know.

256
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:49,475
Rym: There's nothing I can't think of any.

257
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:59,200
Scott: you should you should Pirate or use some other, you know free app, even though it won't be as good Find a way to use the old comics ology app.

258
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,292
Scott: Someone will hack something together by Sarah.

259
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:07,479
Rym: come by paper comics again And just like give them away or don't or just don't read just you know, read something else instead.

260
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:09,728
Scott: Complain to the publisher.

261
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:10,210
Scott: I don't know.

262
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:11,799
Rym: Yeah, it's uh, it's rough.

263
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:19,285
Rym: And if you if you doubt how bad this UX is I'm gonna link to an article that shows like details Exactly how.

264
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:21,360
Rym: but it's so much worse than you're imagining.

265
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:32,320
Scott: Yeah All right, so some smaller You know, but significant news is so everyone, you know, we all everyone knows Miyazaki for listening to this episode.

266
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:32,739
Scott: You got it.

267
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:55,095
Scott: That is right and you know Everyone thinks that Miyazaki's anime because that's most of his work as biggest works for all animations and everyone I think hopefully knows That he did manga before then and Nausicaa being the one that's the most popular right much like, you know, Akira has a manga that is longer bigger You know not quite the same as the anime really right?

268
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:56,360
Scott: Nausicaa is much the same way.

269
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:06,760
Scott: there's this huge sprawling epic tale of Nausicaa and The movie is just sort of a you know, sort of Small piece of it cast through a prism, right?

270
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,220
Scott: It's still amazingly good right in both cases Akira and Nausicaa anyway.

271
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:16,099
Scott: But did you know that Miyazaki made other manga besides that?

272
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:42,742
Scott: He did but they've never been available legally in English or even I've never even seen them available illegally in English either maybe somewhere but One of them is going to be published in English legally Shuna's journey from 1983. so a manga that's as old as I am almost It's gonna be available later this year in English Translated.

273
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:44,186
Rym: I'm pretty excited about that.

274
00:21:44,988 --> 00:21:46,432
Scott: Yeah, so that's that's.

275
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:47,876
Rym: you won't be able to read it.

276
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:48,879
Rym: on comics ology.

277
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:57,545
Scott: It's like you had me a Zaki manga as you were holding out on and these manga companies are publishing like some Some garbage.

278
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:58,609
Scott: No one's ever heard of.

279
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,136
Scott: and like two people read right?

280
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:01,140
Scott: It's like come on people.

281
00:22:01,543 --> 00:22:05,668
Scott: If there's legendary all-time great mangas Bring those on over you.

282
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:10,973
Scott: I thought you know, you thought you finished the job back, you know last decade It's like no you didn't you didn't finish the job.

283
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:13,531
Scott: get back on it All right now.

284
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:14,518
Scott: real sad news.

285
00:22:16,362 --> 00:22:24,480
Scott: So there is a person named Kazutaka Miyatake Who is a mecha designer, right?

286
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:46,674
Scott: So a lot of the robots and other, you know mechanical things in many old famous animes like space battles of Yamato and Arcadia my youth and Macross Plus, right This guy had a large hand in designing You know the mecha's of various kinds and ships and things in all those anime.

287
00:22:47,315 --> 00:23:01,303
Scott: I can't a mat, you know and that It's an interesting position in that, you know as an artist and creator You had such a large hand in making something that was so significant To a lot of people.

288
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:07,980
Scott: like the design of like a particular airplane in someone's favorite show can end up being like this legendary creation.

289
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:14,780
Scott: But the actual compensation for doing that work is like in the amount of work that this person did.

290
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:21,357
Scott: I can't imagine they don't have other jobs besides mecha design because like there's only so many things that they worked on.

291
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:31,852
Scott: Yeah, right you know, but Tragedy has struck This person in that there was an electrical fire in their apartment.

292
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:33,838
Scott: this dude is like, you know old.

293
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:40,371
Rym: he's 72 He's like and he was Escaped but he was injured in the fire and lost his apartment.

294
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:45,368
Scott: He lost his apartment and he lost his wife Yeah in a horrible fire.

295
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:46,935
Scott: It was like devastating.

296
00:23:46,955 --> 00:23:52,591
Scott: So this person has created Significant meaningful artworks that have a place in people's hearts around.

297
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:57,574
Scott: the world was never I can't imagine was ever compensated.

298
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,751
Scott: well You know was living in this tiny apartment.

299
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:08,214
Scott: it got set on fire, you know He lost the person he loved the most in addition to all all kinds of stuff.

300
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:10,903
Scott: He's been living in Right.

301
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,855
Scott: Oh, look at this a government that you know for what.

302
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:19,419
Scott: I'm sure there's plenty of bad things We can say about the Japanese government, but the local government provided him a place to live.

303
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:24,278
Scott: in the meantime in the US you'd he'd be on the street, right.

304
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:43,799
Scott: so Unless he had a relative or something who knows what or so there was a GoFundMe to raise some money To help this guy out, you know tens of thousands of dollars, which is you know, not a large amount of money Considering, you know the the grand scheme of the world.

305
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:50,476
Scott: But it's just a real sad story, especially in the context of like, you know, a lot of other tragedies.

306
00:24:50,556 --> 00:25:01,740
Scott: I keep seeing in You know the Japanese Animation and manga world right you had, you know the arson attack in Kyoto, I guess also involving fire, right?

307
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:07,960
Scott: You know that was that was way worse than this and this is already extremely terrible.

308
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:14,660
Scott: Yeah, you know for an industry that pays you basically right almost nothing right as a whole, right?

309
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:24,449
Scott: It's this is just a microcosm of the the greater industry right where you have people doing works that you know Creating art that have huge cultural significance.

310
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:25,292
Rym: They're impactful.

311
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:27,600
Rym: They're beloved right to certain people.

312
00:25:28,103 --> 00:25:30,297
Scott: There is not a lot of compensation for it.

313
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:45,593
Scott: You know the lives of those people isn't necessarily, you know that luxurious Unless you're like, you know the few people who are like mega hits right, you know, just know like to Miyazaki for instance I'm sure he's doing alright.

314
00:25:48,017 --> 00:25:54,020
Scott: and Meanwhile on top of that you have all sorts of additional dangers and tragedies.

315
00:25:54,562 --> 00:26:04,078
Scott: You know some that befall all of us like pandemics, but also You know like the in the Kyoto thing you had, you know, but disgruntled people coming at them.

316
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:08,144
Scott: Yeah, right It's just like these little old animators Just doing.

317
00:26:08,164 --> 00:26:14,126
Scott: they're doing their drawings and they got to deal with extra bullshit on top of the bullshit Everyone else already has to deal with.

318
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:17,920
Rym: yeah all within the broader late capitalist dystopia that we all live in.

319
00:26:19,522 --> 00:26:26,896
Scott: yep, so Your daily reminder Anime industry, huh?

320
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,300
Rym: but anyway things of the day.

321
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,531
Rym: I realize I just did the but anyway thing.

322
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:37,800
Rym: like I said, I wouldn't in the beginning of the show But here we are 20 minutes later.

323
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:48,127
Scott: Anyway, so, uh, this is very much my kind of thing not just like the YouTube video about it But this is this is a rare instance of Rym has a thing of the day Probably better than my thing of the day.

324
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:49,714
Rym: It's a in real life.

325
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:53,789
Rym: This is the kind of shit I like am really invested in.

326
00:26:54,191 --> 00:26:54,351
Rym: like.

327
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,760
Rym: imagine you're hiking through the woods just like in the middle of nowhere.

328
00:26:57,342 --> 00:27:06,067
Rym: You find a pipe or you find a hole and then you poke a stick in it and you realize that that hole goes Way deeper than the stick.

329
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:13,440
Scott: and then you want to give you any specifics because my memory is not that good But I've definitely had experiences of this nature.

330
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,097
Rym: I've climbed inside of old aqueducts before I've broken into buildings.

331
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:24,100
Rym: I Spent hours poking around inside of an abandoned refinery like an oil refinery the Texaco owned in Beacon.

332
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,559
Rym: So what do these kids do think of the day?

333
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,980
Rym: They found a really deep mystery pipe in the woods.

334
00:27:30,101 --> 00:27:33,820
Rym: But unlike young Rym, they live in a world where they just have a GoPro.

335
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:46,099
Rym: They strapped a flashlight and a GoPro to a string and they just lowered the GoPro as far as they could lower it into this Pipe and then they pulled it out and then they looked at the video to see what the fuck was down there.

336
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:50,776
Scott: Yeah, the only disappointing thing is that you know, it's a directional flashlight.

337
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:51,980
Scott: So yeah got to the bottom.

338
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:53,404
Scott: They couldn't see that much.

339
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,614
Rym: I think what I was fascinating is when they got to the bottom.

340
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,780
Rym: There's actually something down there.

341
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,155
Rym: There's like a big cave.

342
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:02,340
Scott: Yeah, they're right.

343
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:12,260
Scott: So I think what you could do is you could actually go back for a rerun Find some you know, take some like flares or something and shove them down the hole first and then send the go.

344
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:13,143
Rym: I go further.

345
00:28:13,404 --> 00:28:17,580
Rym: I am confident I in an environment like this cuz I'm pretty sure I know where this is roughly.

346
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:23,120
Rym: And you know where this is because the kind of forest it is implies the region.

347
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:31,940
Rym: But I didn't even have to do this research because when I scroll down one of the first comments is Geologist here the first 15 feet or so are still.

348
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,073
Scott: Geologist knows exactly what the fuck's going on in a hole.

349
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:36,400
Scott: the ground geologist is like.

350
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,423
Rym: It's probably.

351
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:43,240
Rym: y'all just might as well be hole-in-the-ground experts probably like on the in the Appalachian Mountains like maybe upstate, New York.

352
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,767
Rym: This is it's this kind of thing.

353
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:45,410
Rym: It's that kind of thing.

354
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,420
Rym: It was probably an old-time natural gas.

355
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,240
Rym: Well, they probably you can see the drill bit at the bottom like that thing.

356
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:53,200
Rym: That was the drill bit for when they drilled it.

357
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,578
Rym: They probably accidentally found a giant cave which fucked up their natural gas like.

358
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,280
Rym: well So they gave up and drilled somewhere else and this is just what they left behind.

359
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:03,684
Scott: Is there any gas?

360
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,740
Scott: I mean guess if you throw a match down there would that explode because they dug a hole?

361
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:09,868
Rym: Try it like they were gonna do a natural gas thing.

362
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:11,193
Rym: It's probably not there anymore.

363
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:12,659
Rym: the holes open and venting.

364
00:29:13,347 --> 00:29:14,200
Rym: You can read this comment.

365
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,759
Rym: I'm not gonna read the whole thing, but that's why I made it the thing of the day.

366
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:32,040
Rym: We live in a world where some kids can find a hole and throw a GoPro down it for funsies and immediately Some rando on the internet can actually from that video alone explain in detail What that hole is with a high degree of accuracy.

367
00:29:32,663 --> 00:29:36,360
Rym: That is an amazing world to live in if we can just deal with all this other shit that's going on.

368
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:46,000
Scott: Yep, even just 10 15, you know years ago that hole if someone came across it would have been like, you know Some kids might throw some rocks down there for fun.

369
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,359
Rym: Then I might I might have risked like lose my flashlight just throw it down there just to get a glimpse and then that's it.

370
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:53,298
Rym: Maybe throw a match down there, which?

371
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,730
Scott: Depending on when it was water at the bottom.

372
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,584
Rym: There was water at the bottom unsurprisingly All right.

373
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:02,676
Scott: So now my thing of the day, which is still quite good.

374
00:30:02,736 --> 00:30:08,286
Scott: So there's this dude I think he's in according to the video is in Iran and He's got one leg.

375
00:30:08,326 --> 00:30:09,232
Scott: It's a one leg, dude.

376
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:13,332
Scott: I don't like a lot might be Despite being a dude who's got one leg.

377
00:30:13,352 --> 00:30:16,521
Scott: this dude Parkour's Like.

378
00:30:16,562 --> 00:30:21,075
Scott: wow, he Parkour's like, you know better than I'm ever gonna park my whole life.

379
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:22,359
Scott: That's for sure, right?

380
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:25,387
Scott: So it's pretty pretty cool.

381
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,638
Scott: And whenever I see videos like this, you know, I have two thoughts.

382
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:36,839
Scott: one is I definitely don't want to end up, you know in a situation where my body is damaged or missing a leg or anything like that.

383
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:44,259
Scott: But if I'm ever so unfortunate that that does happen, even though I do I will do my best to avoid it.

384
00:30:45,546 --> 00:30:55,979
Scott: I would hope that I have the psychological fortitude to you know, make the most of it like, you know, this dude is and not just Be sad one leg.

385
00:30:56,201 --> 00:31:01,520
Rym: I think about that a lot because honestly but like similarly when I see I ski a lot like I ski pretty hardcore stuff.

386
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:08,010
Rym: that's like a main hobby of mine, but Very often what I'm skiing I'll see people skiing in sleds like.

387
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,099
Rym: there are skis for people who are paralyzed from the waist down.

388
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:10,943
Rym: There are.

389
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:20,280
Rym: now there's a form of skiing for blind people like you can ski where Basically two people ski like near you with leads and they can talk on you and sort of guide you and shout directions.

390
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,260
Rym: So you can ski and they're like sort of guiding and being your eyes.

391
00:31:24,762 --> 00:31:27,192
Rym: There's all these cool adaptive things and I just.

392
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:29,040
Rym: it's very much that same sentiment.

393
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,200
Rym: I think if something unfortunate ever happened to me, that is what I hope I would be capable of doing.

394
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:50,185
Rym: I hope I can be as good as gear as that blind dude that I see fucking killing it over the moguls When I'm out there at a trail somewhere and you know to be honest, you know my current extremely abled body that I have That pretty much.

395
00:31:50,205 --> 00:31:52,899
Scott: I don't think I have any, you know significant disability time.

396
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:56,395
Rym: Things start to go downhill in a hurry as I've discovered.

397
00:31:56,596 --> 00:31:57,099
Rym: that's true.

398
00:31:58,361 --> 00:32:01,909
Scott: Even with even with two functioning legs, like I can't ice skate for shit.

399
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:11,380
Scott: I'd probably be better at sled hockey with one leg Though I will say this I had two legs regular hot.

400
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:14,974
Rym: I got to play a little sled hockey in the Cub Scouts when I was a kid.

401
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:16,300
Rym: It is hard as shit.

402
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,550
Scott: It is so hard.

403
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:23,910
Rym: I Could probably be better at that than regular skating.

404
00:32:23,951 --> 00:32:25,215
Rym: just cuz I've seen you skate.

405
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:26,580
Rym: full disclosure.

406
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,491
Rym: Like you should see what I look like trying to snowboard.

407
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:33,354
Rym: I am I am.

408
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:34,076
Rym: it is.

409
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:40,099
Rym: it is embarrassing In the moment the GeekNights book club book.

410
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,949
Rym: So refreshing to say this.

411
00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:44,754
Rym: Yeah, it is the city we've been.

412
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:46,420
Scott: I'm gonna mention what the buck used to be.

413
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,200
Rym: It is the city we became by NK jemisin, uh, we're gonna do the show like within a month.

414
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:55,960
Rym: We might record it like way in advance of that, but we're gonna do the show in a month.

415
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,365
Rym: So you got about a month to read this thing.

416
00:32:57,385 --> 00:33:01,960
Scott: one listener in our discord told me that they're 20 something percent done with it.

417
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,689
Scott: So, you know people are moving right along.

418
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:05,753
Rym: It's a fast read.

419
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:06,575
Rym: It's a good read.

420
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:07,900
Rym: It's a very GeekNights book.

421
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,525
Rym: It's a very New York book.

422
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:13,517
Rym: It's got some beats that are gonna drop where you're gonna go.

423
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:15,469
Rym: Damn That's what room was.

424
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,466
Scott: No, I didn't finish it yet So you didn't get to the beats.

425
00:33:18,486 --> 00:33:25,038
Rym: that I know but you and Emily have repeatedly told me that there are beats without spoiling them and I know they're coming.

426
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:30,629
Rym: I I'm really excited to plow through this book.

427
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,075
Rym: I don't think it's gonna be a long read.

428
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,335
Scott: I Just imagined the beat again and I got.

429
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:35,819
Scott: I got the thing.

430
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:43,220
Scott: I do want to hear from people though who are not new people who are familiar with New York City.

431
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:44,726
Scott: Maybe you've never been here.

432
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:45,771
Scott: You've never lived here.

433
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:48,060
Scott: Maybe you only visited a couple times, right?

434
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,880
Scott: You're not like a New Yorker by any stretch because this book is so New York.

435
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:59,584
Scott: I want to hear from people who are not so New York and how the New York and this comes across Like.

436
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:00,469
Scott: do they like?

437
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,359
Scott: do you not understand what's going on?

438
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:15,159
Rym: There's the things just really curious about that too Cuz like when I before I moved here like today even to like the mid Hudson Valley or RIT Like I knew New York City's a thing But like and I knew like Oh Brooklyn's a thing.

439
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:17,280
Rym: I guess that's part of New York City and I'd heard of Queens.

440
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:20,695
Rym: I didn't know Staten Island was part of New York City at the time.

441
00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:28,764
Rym: I literally didn't And I knew the Bronx was the thing but like I didn't know which one was which or where they are Anything about them.

442
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:34,356
Rym: and even when we when I first moved here, I had that NFT guide and it was like Manhattan Not the bad kind.

443
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:38,340
Rym: now No, the old the only good NFT was the not for tourists book.

444
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:45,819
Rym: Which was it was basically imagine a book that does what a cell phone with Google Maps does today just for New York City.

445
00:34:46,943 --> 00:34:52,424
Rym: Yep in Adara before people had smartphones like it was real important book But the whole book was just Manhattan.

446
00:34:52,784 --> 00:34:58,740
Rym: and then it had one very small chapter called the outer boroughs in case you venture there.

447
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:07,050
Rym: So, uh, yeah otherwise We'll probably have some virtual panels at a thank icon.

448
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:09,740
Rym: We'll probably have a panel or two at PAX East.

449
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:12,246
Rym: Maybe just me maybe me and Scott.

450
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:14,472
Rym: that's all like up in the air.

451
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,080
Rym: Of course, but no, you know numbers are looking good.

452
00:35:17,704 --> 00:35:23,540
Scott: I plan to go to PAX East for probably also Traveling all that way just to do a panel is kind of a pain in the ass.

453
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,110
Rym: Oh, yeah it is but it's weird is I almost miss that cuz?

454
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:37,543
Rym: I've ever my life outside of GeekNights until kovid was Flying around the world constantly for work shit going to Boston for like one meeting and then taking the Acela home Like that was a life I lived.

455
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:44,339
Scott: so I mean if it was, you know I guess if it was safe to eat indoors that you probably won't be then like suddenly.

456
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:54,315
Rym: Oh if it was safe to eat indoors I would go to PAX East like for a day or two like maybe the worthiness of the trip would rise Significantly up because Boston's good restaurant seemed though.

457
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,079
Rym: I have bad news.

458
00:35:55,823 --> 00:36:04,942
Rym: based on a cursory examination of Google Maps The number of restaurants within walking distance of paxis has dropped Precipitously.

459
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:10,680
Scott: Oh, no, I would suggesting like if I'm going like if let's say this it's perfectly safe, right?

460
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,020
Scott: But I'm only going to paxi.

461
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:18,460
Rym: And then when we're done we go to the good part of Boston and even those good to go to that Indian place.

462
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:32,153
Scott: Or we could go to the breakfast the secret breakfast then go to paxi's then go back go to the Indian play park over there For dinner right then get that ice cream from the place Triton cafe if that's still there something like something like that, right?

463
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:40,400
Scott: Yeah, we could we could make it good But without the indoor dining situation, you know going there because indoor dining is like the less.

464
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:46,740
Rym: I don't think I'm gonna do that anytime soon Especially because even the places that are good enough vaccine mandates are about to drop them.

465
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:50,495
Rym: So I'm even less inclined to eat indoors without a mascot any time.

466
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:53,975
Scott: for the foreseeable future We're still gonna see how it goes.

467
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:57,811
Rym: Yeah, but It depending on the situation we could take the like.

468
00:36:58,514 --> 00:37:00,060
Rym: we could take the Acela there and back.

469
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,546
Rym: It's a pretty quick trip.

470
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:09,440
Rym: If you take the Acela, it's a lot of money though for one lousy Yeah, or I'd be willing to drive us there cuz I'll be going anyway.

471
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,574
Rym: That's a lot of time though, but then I don't have to wear a mask during the whole trip.

472
00:37:13,735 --> 00:37:21,916
Rym: I like I guess But the problem is driving to Boston wouldn't be that much cheaper than the Acela because not just holes.

473
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:32,189
Rym: parking in Boston Is like if you put made a list of things Rym Is unwilling to deal with and is mad about.

474
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:45,256
Rym: parking in Boston is like weirdly in the top ten on earth not counting things like fascism, so Anyway, if Pax East was only during the summer, oh my god, then it wouldn't matter.

475
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,220
Rym: Yeah, we go to that barbecue place That's outside.

476
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:52,360
Scott: Well, if it was in the summer, we could arrange it so that we bike to Pax East.

477
00:37:53,060 --> 00:38:05,100
Rym: Whoo, I get a bike home eminently doable Bike home from Pax East and you just keep our bikes in the hotel room Yeah, or even we drive there, but we bring the bikes and we just bike to everyone around lunch.

478
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:07,139
Rym: We bike to the secret breakfast place.

479
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:09,628
Scott: Well, they have bike share in Boston true.

480
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:11,216
Rym: It's kind of like city bike.

481
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:16,363
Rym: last time I used it It was not that expensive, but that was in like 2014.

482
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:18,494
Scott: I want to say I also don't know where the fuck I'm going.

483
00:38:18,514 --> 00:38:19,137
Scott: That's the difference.

484
00:38:19,178 --> 00:38:19,640
Scott: the city bike.

485
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,142
Scott: I know where the hell.

486
00:38:20,202 --> 00:38:24,360
Rym: I actually do know I've spent a lot of time in Boston only they I vaguely know.

487
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,764
Scott: I know the general direction.

488
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:30,638
Rym: I've probably spent literally 10 to 10 X more time in Boston than you have in my life.

489
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:33,999
Rym: So Anyway, anyway, let's get right into it.

490
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:47,002
Rym: so Marlboro Hosanna is one of those rare people like in spitting distance of people like Satoshi kong in that Basically bad in a thousand or at least bad in like 990.

491
00:38:47,002 --> 00:38:47,527
Scott: Yeah, he's like.

492
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:48,334
Scott: he's like in the 900 sites.

493
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:55,300
Rym: Yeah in that in that he's never made a stinker but of the seven movies he is made one.

494
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,023
Rym: We all pretty good.

495
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,751
Rym: We've reviewed all of them on gig nights.

496
00:38:58,634 --> 00:38:58,976
Scott: We have it.

497
00:38:59,016 --> 00:38:59,960
Rym: Yeah, I think we have girl.

498
00:39:00,261 --> 00:39:02,351
Rym: Oh, I don't think you ever watched the girl who left her time.

499
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:06,890
Rym: I don't think I saw wolf children What I saw the theater least I saw it in the theater.

500
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,893
Scott: I think I didn't.

501
00:39:08,294 --> 00:39:09,920
Rym: how why did you anyway?

502
00:39:10,761 --> 00:39:12,047
Scott: I've seen all of them.

503
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,374
Scott: I missed that one somehow.

504
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:14,238
Rym: Well, we should watch it.

505
00:39:14,278 --> 00:39:16,090
Rym: It's okay It's not his best movie, but it's good.

506
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:16,796
Rym: I liked it a lot.

507
00:39:17,259 --> 00:39:19,244
Scott: But So we never saw.

508
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:21,711
Scott: I never saw those Digimon ones either though.

509
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,380
Rym: Yeah, those are technically short films, so they don't count.

510
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:25,631
Rym: Okay, so he is done.

511
00:39:25,652 --> 00:39:31,475
Rym: Oh One of the one-piece movies which happens to be the best one-piece movie.

512
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:36,707
Scott: Oh, yeah, that was that's the only one I saw And the secret best one I've seen.

513
00:39:36,768 --> 00:39:40,680
Rym: but also that movie is basically the weird one-piece movie.

514
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,019
Rym: It doesn't fit into the rest of them kind of like beautiful dreamer.

515
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:48,648
Scott: It's one of those ones where it doesn't fit into the continuity because it's like we go to an island We have an adventure then it's over the end, right?

516
00:39:48,689 --> 00:39:51,220
Scott: So but also it's kind of anything.

517
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,455
Rym: It's kind of just slayers the motion picture with different characters way more.

518
00:39:55,475 --> 00:39:55,756
Scott: that is.

519
00:39:55,796 --> 00:39:56,820
Scott: that's what makes it good.

520
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,134
Rym: Yeah way more literally than you might imagine.

521
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:04,073
Rym: when you watch it You know when the beat drops and that one you'll be like, oh Rym wasn't kidding.

522
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:06,140
Rym: It is literally the same goddamn movie.

523
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:11,158
Rym: It's basically yeah the girl who left her time, which I think is the second best film.

524
00:40:11,218 --> 00:40:14,080
Rym: like good God is that movie great summer wars?

525
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,325
Rym: Fantastic film wolf children.

526
00:40:16,345 --> 00:40:19,934
Rym: I think I cried like six or seven times during that movie.

527
00:40:20,515 --> 00:40:21,277
Rym: the boy in the beast.

528
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:26,479
Rym: super fun Mirai, I want to live in that house more than I want most things on earth.

529
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:31,612
Rym: And Belle the one that just came out right.

530
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:32,856
Scott: so it didn't just came out.

531
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:34,020
Scott: it came out like last year.

532
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,176
Scott: We could have gone to see it right away, but we didn't.

533
00:40:38,276 --> 00:40:42,450
Scott: yeah because kovat It came around again and we didn't see it.

534
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:43,112
Scott: cuz go.

535
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:44,476
Rym: but then I could got us.

536
00:40:44,557 --> 00:40:50,035
Scott: I could have seen someone Pirated it from an online film festival that I missed and I could have watched that.

537
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,380
Rym: but I did Emily and I got it.

538
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,080
Rym: But cuz you know Emily has film connection.

539
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,791
Rym: So we got invited to an Oscar Oscar screening with free tickets.

540
00:40:57,212 --> 00:40:58,195
Scott: Well, I well that was just.

541
00:40:58,316 --> 00:40:59,740
Scott: that was just the initial screening.

542
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:01,051
Scott: Yeah, I could have bought tickets.

543
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,080
Rym: Yeah, but that was it.

544
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,059
Rym: It was like other people could go to it and the covert numbers were worse then.

545
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:12,100
Scott: But I think what you know, that was just the first screening and I guess you were under the impression It was some special difference.

546
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,460
Rym: Well, cuz we got invited to it sort of separately and there was another function and other stuff around it.

547
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,985
Scott: It was just the first screening.

548
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:22,560
Scott: that was you know, I said I'm not buying tickets to even though I could have anyway.

549
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:35,167
Scott: so then luckily the the museum near us just had a screening and one only museum that I have ever And am currently a member of the Museum of the moving image great place Yep, so which is?

550
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:37,758
Rym: I can just still think back to that Chuck Jones exhibit they had there.

551
00:41:38,768 --> 00:41:46,727
Scott: yeah, so There's you know, they do this from time to time and I guess I can possibly rely on them to do it More often is you know, there's.

552
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:48,112
Scott: they got nerds right in the place.

553
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:50,020
Scott: They got video game exhibits and shit, right?

554
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:50,549
Scott: You know?

555
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,013
Scott: So they've been showing the hot anime movies and like second runs after the.

556
00:41:56,414 --> 00:42:04,907
Rym: the other theaters run them and their theater is small Extremely high quality like Soundproof has basically yeah, it's it's.

557
00:42:04,988 --> 00:42:06,632
Scott: they have this theater and they basically it's.

558
00:42:07,254 --> 00:42:09,520
Scott: it's basically like the a-plus movie theater, right?

559
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,920
Scott: It's like they're constantly upgrading it You know to make sure that it's the best a movie theater can be they gave it got 70.

560
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,404
Scott: They're 70 millimeter projector.

561
00:42:17,424 --> 00:42:24,887
Scott: They got everything they require at least for now still vaccination to get in and it was the strictest Policy I've ever seen.

562
00:42:24,908 --> 00:42:27,440
Rym: I have to wear a mask the whole time and they don't even sell concessions.

563
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:33,533
Rym: nor are you allowed to bring food in and The capacity is at 50%.

564
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:34,560
Scott: they won't sell all the seats.

565
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,291
Scott: Yeah, right and they like this place is super paranoid.

566
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:42,450
Scott: They upgraded all their ventilation systems and like Yeah.

567
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:44,504
Scott: So it's like okay.

568
00:42:44,524 --> 00:42:50,682
Scott: They're that paranoid and they have all those policies and the numbers are way down Right.

569
00:42:51,645 --> 00:43:00,165
Rym: I think we can go to this movie and it was weird because that's the first time I've been to a movie theater since like two plus years Since like March 2020.

570
00:43:00,165 --> 00:43:03,615
Scott: I don't even remember the last time I went to a movie theater.

571
00:43:04,398 --> 00:43:11,920
Rym: I remember the yeah We finally got to see the frickin movie that we waited so long Or the actual title of the dragon and the freckled princess?

572
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,831
Scott: right, so Obviously we had seen plenty of trailers.

573
00:43:17,313 --> 00:43:18,740
Scott: We knew it was gonna be about music.

574
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,300
Scott: We knew it was gonna be about some sort of VR cyberspace similar to summer wars.

575
00:43:24,342 --> 00:43:26,374
Scott: We knew it was gonna be a Beauty and the Beast deal.

576
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:27,360
Scott: Did I say that already?

577
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,085
Scott: It's.

578
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:29,880
Scott: if it's not it's apparent from the title.

579
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:39,029
Rym: yup, right and what we know from early like people who had seen it before us was everyone kept talking about how beautiful it is and You could clearly see that parts of it are.

580
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:46,059
Rym: we're sort of 3d CG and parts of it look 2d Mm-hmm, which is part of what the movies about of course.

581
00:43:47,712 --> 00:43:55,450
Scott: yep, so The early reactions were all like tremendously positive But then when it came out in the US I did.

582
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:00,007
Scott: I saw some positive reactions and I started to see some more Mixed or negative one.

583
00:44:00,048 --> 00:44:01,094
Rym: I can't say most.

584
00:44:01,134 --> 00:44:10,859
Rym: most of the negative reactions I saw were I hate to stereotype this way old people who didn't seem to understand it Like they didn't get what it was talking about.

585
00:44:11,964 --> 00:44:12,797
Scott: Maybe who knows?

586
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,694
Scott: regardless, you know.

587
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:22,580
Scott: And an original anime movie that isn't you know, it's not an adaptation of Beauty and the Beast despite heavily referencing it.

588
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:26,411
Scott: So it's like I'm always you know, we always say I'm gonna be excited for that.

589
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:26,872
Scott: Right?

590
00:44:27,093 --> 00:44:31,012
Scott: So we went we saw it and I think it was pretty good.

591
00:44:31,112 --> 00:44:32,020
Rym: I think it was phenomenal.

592
00:44:32,201 --> 00:44:39,254
Rym: It's not like the best like it's not in my top 10 movies ever But I think it's mom or hosted as third best film far and away.

593
00:44:39,274 --> 00:44:41,300
Scott: It's it's definitely among his movies.

594
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:47,760
Scott: It is one of the better ones, but I don't think it is good enough to elevate him to like the next level.

595
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:52,778
Scott: I still put him and Makoto Shinkai sort of like behind.

596
00:44:52,798 --> 00:44:59,900
Rym: I Think this is Bell is materially better than anything Shinkai had except possibly his first work.

597
00:45:02,022 --> 00:45:02,523
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

598
00:45:03,507 --> 00:45:11,396
Rym: I think they're on like the same level but regardless granted your nails anyway, but What's interesting is that one just watch it like if you'd like.

599
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,696
Rym: if you haven't watched it like just go watch it as soon as you right.

600
00:45:13,857 --> 00:45:27,716
Scott: and Because whether we're gonna think about whether this movie is an eight nine ten, you know a minus Yeah, it's a. it's a movie that you should absolutely go see if you have the opportunity to see.

601
00:45:27,756 --> 00:45:34,682
Rym: there is no reason for Anyone any human who has the capacity to see this movie to not see it Like it's just.

602
00:45:34,742 --> 00:45:38,314
Rym: it's a perfectly fine movie and it has a lot to say.

603
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:40,020
Rym: I took a lot away from it.

604
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,286
Scott: Can I name a movie that came out in 2021?

605
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:44,111
Scott: That's better than this movie.

606
00:45:44,212 --> 00:45:46,618
Scott: It's like, you know, and I I don't.

607
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,010
Scott: Was it gets doing right better than this?

608
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:55,413
Rym: Yeah, it was doing better than this is a very Complex and difficult question to answer that.

609
00:45:55,573 --> 00:45:56,880
Rym: maybe this asking me the same.

610
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:59,810
Scott: I guess I put him on the same quality overall.

611
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:04,688
Rym: quite say I was similarly excited for different reasons But you know why this is a better movie.

612
00:46:05,149 --> 00:46:06,053
Rym: This is a movie.

613
00:46:06,494 --> 00:46:09,707
Rym: Dune was part one That's true.

614
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:11,020
Rym: This is a complete movie.

615
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,409
Rym: It ends it says everything it needs to say.

616
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:18,718
Rym: and I'm gonna be to say something a little more controversial Because I've seen summer wars again more recently than you.

617
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:24,497
Rym: It kind of is in some ways a better and tighter summer wars.

618
00:46:24,798 --> 00:46:34,153
Rym: that addresses The reality of the internet and the reality of how people use technology far more Realistically than summer wars did.

619
00:46:34,555 --> 00:46:42,554
Rym: well in a bit in a bit We're gonna assume you saw it and we're not gonna like spoil spoil But we have to reveal some things to talk about this movie with any depth.

620
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,847
Scott: Yeah, I Think that the movie was actually an inverse.

621
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:48,311
Scott: summer wars, right?

622
00:46:48,352 --> 00:47:01,072
Scott: Whereas summer wars, you know the majority of The you know story of summer wars is taking place outside of the cyberspace Real world and cyberspace intrudes into the real world and causes problems.

623
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:12,180
Scott: and cyberspace is like this small Thing off to the side in summer wars, but the climax of summer wars ends up being in fully in the cyberspace.

624
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:19,048
Rym: So imagine the early internet where websites and like early social media are really isolated not like you could.

625
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:28,037
Rym: only there was a time when you could look at how you Interacted on the internet and look at your real life and they were for a very brief period very separated from each other.

626
00:47:28,438 --> 00:47:36,635
Rym: that separation was fictitious and Disappeared as soon as technology spread more and that movie sort of addresses how that happened.

627
00:47:36,655 --> 00:47:38,540
Rym: like suddenly the problems of the internet.

628
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:39,812
Rym: Nope, they're in the real world.

629
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:40,296
Rym: Guess what?

630
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,579
Rym: Hospitals are having problems because of internet shit.

631
00:47:44,822 --> 00:47:49,980
Scott: So in Bell you have a complete integration of the cyberspace and the real world.

632
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:57,619
Scott: Right, people are occupying both spaces at the same time, you know events don't like just happen in one place or the other.

633
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,520
Scott: they happen overall and There you see those events in both places.

634
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:02,941
Scott: Yep,

635
00:48:03,142 --> 00:48:04,546
Rym: and I go further and say that just

636
00:48:04,586 --> 00:48:05,489
Scott: like the real world

637
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:20,536
Rym: this movie like the core message of it fundamentally if you just zoom out is that Especially if you look at kids today like people younger than us who live in the world as it is today The internet is just part of the real world is just part of their lives.

638
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:22,385
Rym: They're inseparable.

639
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:34,454
Rym: you can't pretend that one is somehow different or special and the prop problems people have in both sides follow each other and Everyone is living a dual life whether they realize it or not.

640
00:48:34,816 --> 00:48:40,460
Rym: and this movie Portrays that in a just profound and direct way.

641
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:49,200
Rym: And I guess Summer Wars had a lot of kind of fakie technology as part of it like the encryption stuff in the past.

642
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,155
Rym: We're like, it just didn't really map.

643
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:58,180
Rym: This Bell almost maps one-to-one to the reality of how young people interact with the internet and how it works for them.

644
00:48:58,661 --> 00:49:02,774
Rym: It's just a much more realistic movie despite being set in a future.

645
00:49:03,115 --> 00:49:08,517
Scott: It's like they despite the unrealistic You know put in some things in your ears and you're exactly like it's.

646
00:49:08,718 --> 00:49:09,140
Rym: it's showing.

647
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:11,108
Rym: It's kind of like how Ghost in the Shell.

648
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:13,840
Rym: Ghost in the Shell standalone complex to use an anime example.

649
00:49:14,564 --> 00:49:21,320
Rym: It portrays very realistically how information Travels on the internet and the problems that causes in the real world.

650
00:49:21,781 --> 00:49:28,004
Rym: But it shows that to you via cyber bodies and ridiculous nonsense that does not exist in the real world Right.

651
00:49:28,144 --> 00:49:34,589
Scott: So then you so compared to Summer Wars, it's integrated versus separated But then the climax of Bell right.

652
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:45,705
Scott: whereas the climax of Summer Wars is resolved in cyberspace Climax of Bell is is in the real world is right is what matters and that's why I think this movie is so great And why I'm.

653
00:49:45,906 --> 00:49:48,239
Rym: I think I have a slightly higher opinion than you.

654
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:55,407
Rym: That's really what I'm focused on the fact that this movie in the end basically says look What's the what's the premise of you?

655
00:49:55,568 --> 00:49:58,260
Rym: the the virtual world the metaverse of this universe?

656
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,945
Rym: Escape yourself start a new life.

657
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:02,669
Rym: and what's the climax of this movie?

658
00:50:03,231 --> 00:50:04,133
Rym: You are you.

659
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:06,700
Rym: you cannot escape yourself by going to the internet?

660
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:14,189
Rym: That's a dream that a company is trying to sell you as a famous song You can't hide from yourself.

661
00:50:14,229 --> 00:50:15,013
Scott: However, you go.

662
00:50:15,033 --> 00:50:15,596
Scott: There you are.

663
00:50:15,616 --> 00:50:22,587
Rym: and But it goes deeper than that like something Like the way the movie portrays this.

664
00:50:22,988 --> 00:50:29,170
Rym: there's a scene where the main Bell's friend her main the main character her friend is Helping her become a vtuber.

665
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,700
Rym: basically like that's what's happening?

666
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:54,037
Rym: Like you get a sort of montage of it and she's this like gremlin II internet person like guy and her avatar in the you universe is this sort of gremlin II look in ghosts, but there's a scene where she is logged in and like interacting in the metaverse But she's also sitting at her computer turned around looking at the main character talking to her and behind her.

667
00:50:54,138 --> 00:51:05,270
Rym: on the screen her avatar is emoting and doing the thing she's doing in real life and it really like that scene in particular Crystallizes this duality and just portrays it in a really interesting way.

668
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:09,464
Rym: and you see that type of portrayal throughout the movie Right.

669
00:51:09,565 --> 00:51:21,560
Scott: I mean, I don't disagree with any of that But I think the reason I think the things that brought the movie down For me is as nothing to do with like, you know the message or the plot and in fact the characters in this movie.

670
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:22,988
Scott: I think it's got amazing characters.

671
00:51:23,108 --> 00:51:25,260
Rym: They're very human characters, right?

672
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:31,080
Scott: All the characters are like interesting and have personalities and are right and they're funny.

673
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:43,843
Rym: this kind of movie in anime in particular just generally doesn't tend to have a particular kind of like direct comedy that This movie has a scene in a train station that I was laughing out loud almost uncontrollably Right.

674
00:51:43,903 --> 00:51:45,469
Scott: I think that the parts of this movie.

675
00:51:45,509 --> 00:51:51,269
Scott: I think they just brought it down was that you know in the beginning It's a little bit disjointed right?

676
00:51:51,329 --> 00:52:04,820
Scott: They they clearly took this opening scene Right like the epic, you know sort of you know singing on the whale thing I can see in the trailer as the opening scene of the movie, but chronologically that's not where the movie starts.

677
00:52:04,901 --> 00:52:10,100
Scott: it's like immediately after that they sort of rewind and Go back to say how did we get there?

678
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:17,508
Scott: And it just be you know at that beginning it just becomes a little Disjointed and I was like for like a couple of minutes.

679
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:19,695
Scott: I was like wait to seven before after.

680
00:52:19,715 --> 00:52:21,200
Scott: it's like we went back.

681
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,145
Scott: Is this a flashback?

682
00:52:22,185 --> 00:52:23,251
Scott: did we flash forward yet?

683
00:52:23,653 --> 00:52:24,840
Scott: Oh, we're not flashing forward.

684
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:31,340
Scott: We just rewound after the first scene and then pressed play and then when we got to the first scene we skipped over it.

685
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:31,940
Rym: I can see that.

686
00:52:31,984 --> 00:52:38,169
Rym: I mean I guess it felt natural to me like I got it immediately like there was zero Confusion or like I didn't even think about that.

687
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,037
Scott: and then I can see where does that?

688
00:52:40,217 --> 00:52:40,880
Scott: where exactly?

689
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,372
Scott: Chronologically does that first scene like insert after the rewind right?

690
00:52:45,532 --> 00:52:47,437
Scott: It's like, you know, it wasn't clear, right?

691
00:52:49,761 --> 00:52:50,163
Scott: So it's like.

692
00:52:50,203 --> 00:52:55,860
Scott: I knew stuff that was then then didn't know it wasn't, you know, anyway, so that was a little bit.

693
00:52:56,783 --> 00:53:16,100
Scott: And then the other thing is that you know, there were a lot of quality Concepts I think and like many messages Inserted throughout the movie like the baseball player guy and or the singing the tumbler-doxing brigade Specifically yeah, the singing grandma's.

694
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,169
Rym: Yeah, well we spoil a little bit the singing grandma's.

695
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:27,795
Rym: the moment when they reveal a piece of information among themselves Was a very good moment in that movie.

696
00:53:27,896 --> 00:53:35,432
Scott: Oh, it's real good But you can clearly see you know The movie was trying to say a bunch of more things.

697
00:53:35,753 --> 00:53:41,570
Scott: right that were all good things to say that were relevant But it often said them as sort of like.

698
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:41,911
Scott: it's like.

699
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:46,221
Scott: it was like sudden and out of nowhere like insertions Right.

700
00:53:46,742 --> 00:53:49,371
Rym: It's like see I didn't really see that though.

701
00:53:49,451 --> 00:53:56,166
Rym: I saw it more as they felt like natural evolutions of how I guess It was almost.

702
00:53:56,186 --> 00:53:58,013
Scott: it was almost jump-cuddy where it's like.

703
00:53:58,033 --> 00:53:58,596
Scott: well who could?

704
00:53:59,077 --> 00:53:59,680
Rym: ah, you said it.

705
00:54:00,283 --> 00:54:01,349
Rym: So this is what I was getting at.

706
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:02,154
Rym: This is hard to articulate.

707
00:54:02,174 --> 00:54:03,140
Rym: Who could this bad guy be?

708
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,560
Scott: Let's Google search is it this guy this guy this guy?

709
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,664
Scott: But that's load

710
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:11,875
Rym: really naturally for me like that felt like how the internet is and I and

711
00:54:11,935 --> 00:54:21,253
Scott: suddenly it's like someone's just doing a Google search and then that Google search they just did it's like with like instantly suddenly It's like know that those those things they just searched for.

712
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:24,850
Scott: that's actually important Right, even though they it was on the screen.

713
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:29,247
Rym: So here's a theory I have because that Would you disagree?

714
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:30,250
Rym: and this is good faith?

715
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,480
Rym: Like I'm not trying I'm not making fun of you or trying to make some weird point.

716
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:46,159
Rym: I have a point about the movie that You and I are too old to be truly in touch with like the zennials below us Like we're we can't a hundred percent know them, but let alone people younger than that I obviously can't hundred percent know them.

717
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,959
Rym: But you know, we we are closer to them and understand them better than say people older than us.

718
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:55,459
Rym: But we are not a hundred percent in touch with what kids today like.

719
00:54:56,345 --> 00:55:11,687
Scott: No, I mean cuz you know It's like on the one hand I see I see some of the things that they're into And I don't I don't poop on them because I learned my lesson not to poop on the kids But I yeah when I see the things that they like it's like, okay, they must like that sort of thing But I don't like that.

720
00:55:11,747 --> 00:55:13,040
Scott: would you disagree?

721
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:25,459
Rym: With the statement that I am NOT saying that I am like radically closer in touch to those kids But I am a little closer to the younger generation than you are in terms of sensibilities like a little bit

722
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:30,098
Scott: I think you do like some internet trash stuff more than I yeah.

723
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,412
Rym: Yeah I'm just saying like I am closer to that.

724
00:55:33,473 --> 00:55:42,510
Scott: I'm not saying that is good or bad I'm simply saying that in that one aspect that you know, you would enjoy You know a homestuck or an undertale and I wouldn't.

725
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:43,613
Scott: so that's not even.

726
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:45,138
Scott: that's not even that young right?

727
00:55:45,158 --> 00:55:45,559
Scott: That's old.

728
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:49,891
Rym: All right Yeah, right Sans undertale is a boomer boomer character.

729
00:55:50,613 --> 00:56:05,159
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, I noticed that people who are the closer someone is to zennial and younger the more Not necessarily positive reception of the movie they had but the less they have the kinds of questions or complaints that you have.

730
00:56:05,641 --> 00:56:11,119
Rym: Because the things you described as being jarring did not register at all to me as jarring.

731
00:56:11,139 --> 00:56:13,809
Scott: that Google You know, I would have cited in general.

732
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,560
Scott: I like a movie that has establishing stuff.

733
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,806
Rym: Oh, yeah, but I would have but I what I would have said.

734
00:56:18,926 --> 00:56:28,180
Scott: they had things that happened and you know mattered that were not given Enough frames of animation to establish them before they met.

735
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:39,340
Rym: so my theory is that someone with a younger internet sensibility would Not notice that or not see it as jarring or almost expect that I was even gonna cite later.

736
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:55,755
Rym: Like I had a note that one of the things I wanted to talk about was the Google search part because I was about to say before you jumped in and said a different thing that that scene was one of the best examples of Having the internet act like it really does for people in the real world and how things are.

737
00:56:55,816 --> 00:56:57,460
Rym: like some drama happens in real life.

738
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:02,695
Rym: suddenly There's a bunch of private net messages and a bunch of Google searches and some doxxing and nonsense.

739
00:57:02,715 --> 00:57:05,606
Rym: that's happening and it's rapid-fire It's resolved and people move on.

740
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:08,077
Scott: and too bad on the one hand.

741
00:57:08,117 --> 00:57:08,760
Scott: That's correct.

742
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:16,891
Scott: But on the other hand, it's like, you know, if there's some if there's some sort of thing like that and it's like, alright Let's go to the reddit thread and it's like, okay.

743
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:20,789
Scott: Here's people are suspecting You know, it's a B or C. It's like.

744
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,596
Scott: that's just all a bunch of bullshit.

745
00:57:22,616 --> 00:57:23,520
Scott: I'm not gonna take it, right?

746
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:30,385
Rym: it's like that would be real internet when it's like Like they dare like the internet Docsis and narrows down.

747
00:57:30,545 --> 00:57:44,540
Rym: one of the mystery is to like this set of people and then one by one you see like the dot the mob of internet bullshit reached back into the real world and then suddenly a Baseball player has to like issue a statement and like all these echoes happen.

748
00:57:45,002 --> 00:57:49,560
Rym: All I'm saying is that the way those scenes were put together I think that's part of it.

749
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:49,670
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:59,440
Rym: But I'm saying the way those scenes were put together like your complaint about them the jarring nature The lack of frames paid attention to them like how it just moves on the quick rapid cuts.

751
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:10,474
Rym: I think that is just the sensibility of a younger internet generation that I Am a little too old to be close to and you are for various reasons further from.

752
00:58:10,795 --> 00:58:12,861
Rym: so it bothers you more than it bothers Me.

753
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:18,380
Rym: hence, I did not even notice the complaints you raised until you raised them in this podcast just now.

754
00:58:19,182 --> 00:58:23,889
Scott: Well, I think you know, it's not really I don't think has to do with sensibility.

755
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:24,613
Scott: I think this is you with.

756
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:28,308
Scott: you know, cinematography Oh, but I think that style of I don't know if that's.

757
00:58:28,388 --> 00:58:31,940
Scott: I don't even know if that's actually the sensibility of younger people.

758
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:36,980
Scott: Or you know, is it just he wanted to cram a lot of things into the movie and he didn't have time for all that?

759
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:41,440
Scott: So he's rather than cut things he squeezed him, but I felt like the way it was squeezed.

760
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,763
Rym: It doesn't.

761
00:58:42,864 --> 00:58:50,004
Rym: I guess my opinion is the way it was squeezed made it punch more and work better in the film and tell the Film story better.

762
00:58:50,024 --> 00:58:51,049
Rym: and you disagree.

763
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:54,565
Scott: I'm not going to assume that because the you know The creators decision.

764
00:58:54,585 --> 00:58:58,099
Scott: is it because the creator knows the audience so well, right?

765
00:58:58,179 --> 00:59:00,314
Rym: Oh, yeah I know I am still going from.

766
00:59:00,354 --> 00:59:04,520
Rym: the author is dead Until I get a chance to maybe like ask him a question.

767
00:59:05,102 --> 00:59:10,726
Rym: So because I did get to ask the Toshi kana question once and he was very much like nope That was not our intention.

768
00:59:10,766 --> 00:59:13,739
Rym: In fact, we didn't even know how that show was gonna end while we were making it.

769
00:59:14,703 --> 00:59:16,190
Rym: We had described how things go.

770
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:18,160
Rym: we had to scramble to make those last two episodes.

771
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:23,857
Rym: We literally didn't know how paranoia agent was gonna end until we started production of the penultimate episode.

772
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:26,787
Scott: Yeah Alright, so let's talk about some other things.

773
00:59:26,807 --> 00:59:28,252
Scott: So first of all music movie.

774
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:30,519
Rym: Obviously, I was listening soundtrack on loop.

775
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:35,255
Scott: It heavily focused on music because the main character like this is about.

776
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:36,219
Rym: this is not a spoiler.

777
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:37,603
Rym: She's a vtuber.

778
00:59:37,944 --> 00:59:49,920
Scott: straight up easy Macross plus a girl becomes a vtuber and that's a big Right, so they released the soundtrack before the movie, you know, they focused on the song and the trailer, right?

779
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,797
Scott: You know when we're talking about the Beauty and the Beast aspect, we're talking Disney Beauty and the Beast.

780
00:59:54,898 --> 00:59:58,193
Rym: It's a musical To the level of there is singing.

781
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:06,360
Rym: there is deep homage To the point that there is a scene where the beauty and the Beast dance together and it is just roses.

782
01:00:06,781 --> 01:00:09,529
Scott: There's a room full of roses as opposed to the single rose.

783
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:13,060
Scott: it like it is not just alluding to the original Beauty and the Beast.

784
01:00:13,464 --> 01:00:14,373
Scott: You know fairy tale.

785
01:00:14,534 --> 01:00:25,684
Rym: it is referencing the Disney point that it has a Rotating CG scene of a dance that is identical to the one in the Disney one Which if you were.

786
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:35,540
Rym: if you don't remember when the Disney Beauty and the Beast came out there were Documentaries talking about how they made that one scene, right?

787
01:00:35,661 --> 01:00:43,456
Scott: So they also instead of a bunch of talking China They had a bunch of those a eyes little group of a eyes.

788
01:00:43,496 --> 01:00:44,079
Scott: They were so cute.

789
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,524
Rym: Yeah, I love the little see.

790
01:00:45,544 --> 01:00:48,114
Rym: an enemy like the Beast lives in a castle all alone.

791
01:00:48,235 --> 01:00:49,580
Scott: He's a sad dude, right?

792
01:00:49,980 --> 01:01:00,457
Scott: So but while all those like incidental things and homages to Beauty and the Beast are there The overall story is not a story is not the story of Beauty and the Beast.

793
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:08,740
Scott: No, right It's like they just took those elements the well scenes and references and setting character.

794
01:01:09,382 --> 01:01:14,820
Scott: But the story of Beauty and the Beast like doesn't align with this one that much.

795
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:19,295
Rym: Well, I would argue it aligns more than you're letting on but I can't.

796
01:01:19,315 --> 01:01:20,920
Scott: a Gaston named Justin?

797
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:29,759
Rym: Well Gaston is literally just like the the mod of a tumblr or a subreddit that's full of angry Doxing furries.

798
01:01:30,462 --> 01:01:32,449
Scott: There is an angry mob who wants to.

799
01:01:32,549 --> 01:01:35,960
Scott: you know, it was against the Beast right just like original.

800
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:37,185
Rym: But why are they against the Beast?

801
01:01:37,206 --> 01:01:44,300
Rym: because the Beast is a troll who does go around wrecking havoc And I can't say more without spoiling major emotional a slot.

802
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:48,893
Scott: I mean I can spoil original Beauty and the Beast right and a Beauty and the Beast.

803
01:01:49,193 --> 01:01:51,540
Scott: the Beast kidnaps Belle's dad, right?

804
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:53,300
Rym: But I guess that without.

805
01:01:54,502 --> 01:02:00,180
Rym: When you watch this movie think about how the Beast acted in the universe.

806
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:04,400
Rym: Why Belle and the Beast interacted at all?

807
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,392
Rym: Why Belle was able to reach the Beast in the end?

808
01:02:09,175 --> 01:02:10,480
Rym: and then what the actual?

809
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,818
Rym: Climax of the movie is on that rainy street.

810
01:02:14,003 --> 01:02:23,560
Rym: All of that together is very close to some of the fundamental themes of Beauty and the Beast even Disney's Beauty and the Beast Even though the literal plot points of that movie diverge wildly.

811
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,126
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

812
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:40,846
Rym: The plot is not the same but all these other things You know are in and I would say the way what the Beast represents and what it is in terms of the actual story once you see what the whole story was is Fantastic and extremely well done.

813
01:02:41,448 --> 01:02:48,699
Rym: and a similar story was told in Hypno space outlaw Kind of literally

814
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,082
Scott: and

815
01:02:50,303 --> 01:03:02,285
Rym: it's it's an important story because a big theme of this movie is there are people who act online a certain way differently from how they act in the real world because of trauma or issue in the real world.

816
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,801
Rym: and this movie it Won.

817
01:03:04,941 --> 01:03:09,919
Rym: one hand it shows the worst parts of the internet because what are the worst parts of the internet right now?

818
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,008
Rym: doxing brigades Bullshit mobbing online her lighting.

819
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:15,674
Rym: Yep swatting real been.

820
01:03:16,035 --> 01:03:17,540
Rym: but what are the good things about the internet?

821
01:03:17,981 --> 01:03:27,149
Rym: These are two human beings who pre-internet could never have met and no one could have Helped the person who is the Beast.

822
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:34,498
Rym: they're just cut off from the world and alone but the internet allowed them to find someone they could trust and talk to.

823
01:03:34,518 --> 01:03:40,522
Rym: a Connection that was positive was made that could not have been made pre-internet Mm-hmm.

824
01:03:41,224 --> 01:03:42,829
Scott: It shows you the you know, good.

825
01:03:42,889 --> 01:03:49,147
Rym: Well, it's showing you more than those other movies and the Beast of Social media and the internet.

826
01:03:49,969 --> 01:03:54,020
Rym: the modern internet brings great three things and terrible things and we have to take them all.

827
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:59,099
Scott: It is true that you know, there's not a lot of other movies at least not ones that I've seen.

828
01:03:59,722 --> 01:04:10,200
Scott: You know most of the times when you get a cyberspace, it's like, you know some far-future unrealistic cyberspace Right or you know some ancient archaic idea that doesn't match reality.

829
01:04:10,401 --> 01:04:12,507
Scott: It's like this is you know, the?

830
01:04:12,527 --> 01:04:16,720
Scott: the VR part of it is not, you know real but everything else about it matters.

831
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:29,690
Rym: Perhaps the contemporary internet like right now Even though you're seeing our physical faces if you're watching a live stream the Rym and Scott you know from this is not Actually the Rym and Scott in real life though.

832
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:30,514
Rym: They are similar.

833
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,020
Rym: They are not the same.

834
01:04:33,681 --> 01:04:39,200
Scott: All right, so I do want to talk about the one scene in the movie the best possible scene.

835
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,534
Scott: Should we say spoiler line in and the train?

836
01:04:41,675 --> 01:04:43,084
Rym: Oh the train station I was.

837
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:49,190
Rym: I did not expect a scene like that to happen and Much like the elevator scene in Evangelion.

838
01:04:49,751 --> 01:04:56,636
Rym: There is a power in having a silent Unmoving frame persists on a screen in an animated saves.

839
01:04:56,776 --> 01:04:57,660
Scott: it also saves money.

840
01:04:57,941 --> 01:04:59,528
Rym: But it was just long.

841
01:04:59,548 --> 01:05:14,275
Rym: and like we're sitting in the theater and as that scene unfolds bit by bit people in the audience start laughing and it just kept growing and growing and growing to the point that the entire crowd was just like Defying at a relatively straightforward joke that was just executed very well.

842
01:05:15,058 --> 01:05:21,924
Scott: in some ways it does feel like it could have been one of those movies where someone thought up a bunch of amazing scenes and then found a Way to stick them together.

843
01:05:21,944 --> 01:05:25,640
Scott: and if that is the case, this is one of those scenes that they thought of in advance.

844
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,818
Scott: They want to stick that in.

845
01:05:27,859 --> 01:05:32,011
Rym: well Cuz there's that there's a sub theme with that kid in particular around.

846
01:05:32,332 --> 01:05:38,020
Rym: it's the same message as master Keaton and some other things We've talked about in that you can do something for fun.

847
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,872
Rym: You do not have to be the best at it to do it at all.

848
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:42,920
Rym: and the sharing of hobbies and like why do you?

849
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:43,600
Rym: Why do you sing?

850
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,506
Rym: Why do you do anything?

851
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:46,199
Rym: is a big part of this movie too?

852
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,359
Rym: Look at the of the vtuber who got completely eclipsed by Belle and her revelation at the end.

853
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,292
Rym: She's just a person like me.

854
01:05:53,373 --> 01:05:57,251
Rym: like that kind of story I don't have to be the best to do a thing at all.

855
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:02,126
Rym: and that character was part of that story Their virtual idols.

856
01:06:02,447 --> 01:06:04,235
Scott: Yeah, it's not quite the same thing.

857
01:06:04,838 --> 01:06:12,167
Rym: Uh There I think they're very close to being the same thing because What we're not at Belle does not have an AI.

858
01:06:12,227 --> 01:06:14,854
Rym: that is continuing to be Belle when Belle's not online.

859
01:06:14,875 --> 01:06:19,396
Scott: I Guess yeah, it's not the same as Hatsune Miku, right?

860
01:06:19,436 --> 01:06:27,949
Rym: Yeah Where there is no one would be it's more Matt cross plus where there is a person who is Sharon Apple Which is why I'm saying it's more vtuber because that's what vtubers are.

861
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:33,015
Scott: they make a persona that but a vtuber isn't necessarily like Making and performing music, right?

862
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:47,587
Scott: It's just well They're making it performing and you're lying on self with a different, you know, you know graphic right avatar instead of your own face, but a Virtual Idol is like specifically Singing dancing.

863
01:06:47,647 --> 01:06:48,249
Scott: Yeah performing.

864
01:06:48,269 --> 01:06:52,759
Rym: Well vtuber is a superset of virtual idol maybe.

865
01:06:56,355 --> 01:06:59,670
Scott: Anyway, uh So the scene of the scene of the train station spoilers, I guess.

866
01:06:59,931 --> 01:07:00,974
Rym: Yeah, it just it was.

867
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:06,728
Rym: it was really so Movie just stop listening cuz we're gonna.

868
01:07:06,748 --> 01:07:10,905
Rym: we're gonna spoil a few things, but we won't go crazy on spoilers, obviously Right.

869
01:07:10,946 --> 01:07:12,260
Scott: So the scene in the train station.

870
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:18,649
Scott: So some of the parts of the scene I saw coming way in advance like the fact that the really popular girl was actually nice And not a jerk.

871
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:30,178
Rym: Yeah, the Clearly the the two awkward characters who are actually popular Don't realize that the person who they think is the popular one is just as awkward as them.

872
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:30,580
Rym: like that.

873
01:07:30,862 --> 01:07:33,702
Rym: That's a trope that I enjoy in general Right.

874
01:07:33,963 --> 01:07:37,293
Scott: Also, you know, you could get a hint actually from the excellent animation.

875
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:54,731
Scott: the popular girl in the opening scene Right is like oh, she's so pretty and popular and talented but she's doing a funky dance with a saxophone and Like and the way that dance is animated is just so fun to look at right I could tell and I was like wait That's the popular girl that they're all, you know, we have to try

876
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:56,537
Rym: to try hard band nerd.

877
01:07:56,557 --> 01:07:58,364
Scott: Okay I'm like, I'm like.

878
01:07:58,605 --> 01:08:00,614
Scott: she's definitely a weirdo, right?

879
01:08:00,654 --> 01:08:02,040
Scott: She's not like why?

880
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:07,980
Scott: She's not like mean girls, you know ultra popular princess, you know, clearly, right?

881
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:08,944
Scott: You could tell right away.

882
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:11,554
Scott: and then in that same scene they introduced her.

883
01:08:11,614 --> 01:08:19,337
Scott: they introduced weird canoe guy Right and you could just tell immediately like, you know, yep, you know canoe guy and the saxophone girl.

884
01:08:19,358 --> 01:08:25,372
Scott: that's gonna happen Cuz it's you know, it's one of those things where it's like everyone thinks.

885
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:30,560
Scott: the two popular kids wanna you know The hot dude, you know wants to get with the popular girl.

886
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:42,260
Scott: But no, they both want it's a double up right as they both want to do with the the less popular You know weirdo people anyway, but so in this train station scene that all comes to a head, right?

887
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,448
Scott: And you know the it's.

888
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:50,410
Scott: it's great because in some animes and mangas Especially older ones you get that sort of.

889
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:52,240
Scott: never ask her out deal.

890
01:08:52,581 --> 01:09:00,479
Scott: Yeah, where there's so, you know teenagers who are shy and timid and miyaka Tomahome right it never happens.

891
01:09:02,563 --> 01:09:03,486
Scott: Did you get that reference?

892
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,015
Rym: at least as old as I am right?

893
01:09:06,035 --> 01:09:12,120
Scott: or the more popular thing I guess these days is you get like those ones where just get together right at the beginning, right?

894
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,478
Scott: And you get this relationship that goes for the show, right?

895
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:35,219
Scott: Here, I think they struck this really great balance where you had the you know, the teenage You know hesitance and shyness Right present But they still got together right and not just at the last possible second.

896
01:09:36,462 --> 01:09:55,419
Scott: And they got together in a way that is hilarious right, they managed to work in the comedy to you know, sort of ease off on the Sort of like ooh Kind of feelings right already, you know to make it to make it work.

897
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:17,258
Scott: So but yeah, it's just like suddenly like the movie which is you know slows down at that point like a whole lot like to stillness like Rym said To give you this very real world real feelings kind of see Right that you know, I wouldn't be surprised if that scene was like, um, you know couple minutes long.

898
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:18,302
Rym: Oh, yeah It was.

899
01:10:18,382 --> 01:10:19,586
Rym: it was much like not much.

900
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:27,896
Rym: not much happens like the Evangelion elevator scene like no, we're gonna make you sit here It's just gonna just gonna keep going and every time you think okay, that was long enough.

901
01:10:27,976 --> 01:10:28,840
Rym: It just keeps going.

902
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:40,918
Rym: Yeah, so the scene for me and a minor spoiler when the old people you know cuz you know the girl Bell like she's a vtuber and she's keeping her identity secret like only her friend knows.

903
01:10:41,339 --> 01:10:43,987
Rym: but kids all know the well.

904
01:10:44,428 --> 01:10:55,754
Rym: kids all think the adults don't know what's up and when all the old people are like Like oh, yeah She must be having some drama with the vtuber stuff Like we should go help her like the adults knew the entire time.

905
01:10:56,136 --> 01:11:06,980
Rym: just like in real life Adults are way more savvy than kids know and I think this movie the fact that it called that out So directly at the right moment in the movie was just great.

906
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:08,406
Scott: I think also.

907
01:11:08,446 --> 01:11:14,165
Scott: you have to realize though that this is set not in a you know in some Near-ish future, right?

908
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:17,354
Scott: So if if this is what if this is what 2050?

909
01:11:17,354 --> 01:11:19,520
Scott: I don't know what year it is, right?

910
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:24,480
Scott: But you know those old people are basically are us or mate younger than us?

911
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,868
Rym: Well, imagine us if we had kids.

912
01:11:27,389 --> 01:11:30,580
Rym: our kids couldn't hide shit from us that they were doing online.

913
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:36,320
Scott: I would know every point is that those old people are people who grew up in some kind of Internet.

914
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:40,840
Scott: They weren't like our parents who grew up in y'all 20th century almost entirely.

915
01:11:41,722 --> 01:11:42,464
Rym: Yeah, we were the.

916
01:11:42,484 --> 01:11:48,580
Rym: we were literally the last generation that had an analog childhood everyone after us digital from day one

917
01:11:49,262 --> 01:12:03,901
Scott: But the movie sort of you know, you takes the fact that it knows you're watching the movie in 2021 Right, even though it takes place in the future and therefore it can sort of pull aha and remind you that yeah There's.

918
01:12:04,001 --> 01:12:11,026
Scott: oh, you know, even though we've only showed you mostly younger people using this internet No, the whole society is really using it.

919
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:12,390
Scott: Yeah this service, right?

920
01:12:13,112 --> 01:12:14,977
Scott: It doesn't get that many users if it's all kids.

921
01:12:15,158 --> 01:12:20,088
Rym: Yeah and I mean, yeah, just movies great.
