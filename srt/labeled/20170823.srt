00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,907
Rym: It's Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017.

2
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:12,610
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,833
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:17,000
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, DuckTales!

5
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:18,083
Rym: Woo!

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:18,707
Rym: Doo doo doo doo.

7
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:20,839
Scott: Let's do this!

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,170
Scott: Alright.

9
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:29,790
Scott: So you know how lately there seems to be this thing going on, especially on Twitch, with these marathons, right?

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,537
Scott: They show like, all Bob Ross, all Mr.

11
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:33,139
Scott: Rogers.

12
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:33,641
Scott: Yeah!

13
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,010
Scott: Crunchyroll did a marathon, like all these animes for a super long time.

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,674
Rym: Remember RIT Anime, we do the marathons, like alright kids.

15
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:42,760
Scott: No, but these are marathons like, you know, it's just.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,890
Scott: basically we're gonna take this huge amount of content, put it end to end, and just stream it until it's done, right?

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,731
Scott: And that's what they do.

18
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:58,249
Scott: And I guess people tune into that, because I guess it's sort of like a temporary TV channel that only shows one thing, with ads or no ads, depending on your...

19
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:05,069
Rym: And also, there's like one specific thing that that kind of thing does, it makes a pop-up community around that thing.

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:05,631
Rym: Yep.

21
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:10,150
Rym: Like the internet will talk about that thing, like suddenly you and all the Seinfeld people are talking about Seinfeld.

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:20,370
Scott: So I was thinking, what if we took every GeekNights episode end to end, and just plugged it in and streamed it to like a Twitch channel and a YouTube channel.

23
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:22,970
Rym: I could write a Python script that would...

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:29,170
Scott: You just need to put all the episodes on a drive in a computer, connect that computer and just start streaming, and there'd be like a still image there while it streams.

25
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:29,571
Scott: Yep.

26
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:34,510
Scott: And it would just go from the first beta episode all the way to the end without stopping, all in one shot.

27
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,752
Scott: That could actually be kind of fun.

28
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:54,130
Scott: And see if, like would anyone give a shit, or would that just sit there, or it's like, cause the thing is, like I've noticed when you're streaming, it's like the way to get people in the stream is you have to stream long, cause you get one person, and you have to get a few viewers, and then once you have some viewers, your view count goes up, and then you can get more viewers.

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,130
Scott: We have to stay on long enough for that to happen, and I can't play games longer than a few hours.

30
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:58,992
Rym: Well the part of it is that...

31
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:02,461
Scott: A lot of times I've stopped streaming when I have the most viewers, like eight viewers.

32
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:06,110
Scott: finally, because it's been like three hours guys, where were you when I started?

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,331
Rym: Yep.

34
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:09,449
Rym: Well that's probably why I don't do the Twitch, like I focus more on the YouTube for a lot of reasons.

35
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:12,764
Scott: I just do both at the same time, cause you have the technology for that.

36
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,110
Rym: Split those views even more.

37
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,192
Scott: I don't really care about that.

38
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:25,210
Scott: But, uh, so what if we just like streamed every GeekNights episode, the audio, non-stop, would that be, would anyone give a shit?

39
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,090
Rym: That would be like twelve hundred hours.

40
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,789
Rym: It would be ridiculously long.

41
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,030
Rym: That would be like twelve hundred hours of content.

42
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,147
Scott: How many days is that?

43
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:40,010
Rym: Twelve hundred hours divided by twenty four, that's fifty days.

44
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:50,430
Scott: Uh, it didn't take fifty days, so we've done more GeekNights, even though it's only been less years or whatever, it's like, how many hours does it take to watch all the Simpsons?

45
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:54,649
Scott: Yeah, well so... They've been going longer, but they only did once a week.

46
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,630
Rym: God, I just remember as a kid watching like the two hundredth episode special.

47
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,450
Scott: Their episodes are only twenty minutes, and they don't do the whole year, they only do a season.

48
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,350
Scott: It's like, is there actually more hours of GeekNights than there are most other things?

49
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:13,130
Rym: I mean, I watched almost all of Sailor Moon, like everything but the first season and one weekend once.

50
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:22,230
Scott: I mean, in order to like beat us in hours, you start to have to go into things that are like questionable, like, oh, okay, there have been more hours of all baseball games ever.

51
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:22,646
Scott: Yup.

52
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:23,668
Scott: It's like, yeah.

53
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,530
Rym: That channel that's just the guy sitting and meditating all the time, like, I think there's more hours of that than GeekNights.

54
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,142
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, we need, you know, uh...

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,909
Rym: Actually, no, because he only started that like four years ago.

56
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,969
Scott: But I wonder, like, is this a thing we should do?

57
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:35,630
Scott: Yeah.

58
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:39,550
Scott: Is it, was it worthwhile or will it just be a complete waste of bandwidth?

59
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,650
Rym: It would probably, well, I don't care about bandwidth.

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,349
Rym: I mean, people make those ten hours of poop, like fart noise videos on YouTube.

61
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,250
Scott: But like obviously we would, uh, we would have a server that would be doing the streaming.

62
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,429
Rym: Oh yeah, we set up an Amazon instance.

63
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,970
Scott: We would not be doing it in our house.

64
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,530
Rym: You set up an Amazon instance, you point it at the S3 bucket that we got.

65
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,750
Scott: And I write a little, a little RTMP thing and it would use, I'd use the restream.io that I'm already using.

66
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,650
Scott: We might even have to make separate YouTube and Switch channels just for this only.

67
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:07,829
Rym: Yeah, we'd probably want to make like the GeekNights archive.

68
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:14,030
Scott: We'd make a graphic to show in the thing that has like links to actual GeekNights info and then just turn it on.

69
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,290
Rym: It'd take like a day's worth of work to make that happen, I think.

70
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,790
Scott: And then turn it on and then we'd make sure that it's still running.

71
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,029
Scott: We need like a monitoring of some kind because I could imagine it failing.

72
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,889
Rym: Yeah, I could imagine something like that failing at like the 31 day mark.

73
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:29,530
Scott: We need, we need to go, we need to go poke at it to make sure it's still good.

74
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,250
Rym: It's like running a video room at a modern anime con.

75
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,090
Rym: The computer's just going, you gotta like peek at it.

76
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,830
Scott: The question is, is it worth doing?

77
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:37,533
Rym: I don't know.

78
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:40,289
Rym: I feel like I want to now just for the fuck of it.

79
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:40,910
Scott: Yeah, right?

80
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:41,553
Rym: Yeah.

81
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:42,989
Rym: People seem into it here.

82
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:57,450
Rym: Anyway, so in the actual news, in case you didn't listen to our Monday episode on passwords, which you probably should because I actually know two different people who had a similar hack happen to them like recently.

83
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,876
Rym: This is on the rise.

84
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:01,470
Rym: Now, most people seem to be hacking this way to steal Bitcoins.

85
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,649
Rym: It was notable that they did this to steal.

86
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,470
Scott: That's when people use the word hacking, right?

87
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:27,750
Scott: Because hacking, regardless of how you define hacking, when you say, for example, my account got hacked, that implies in the minds of the average person that some nefarious computer genius with a black screen and green text, you know, work some magic and types of magic codes and now has control of your account due to nefarious means.

88
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:36,490
Scott: When actually all it means is someone, you know, or some bot or something figured out your password because your password is ridiculous.

89
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,532
Rym: No, no, no, no, no.

90
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:38,656
Rym: None of these situations.

91
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:42,070
Rym: None of the situations I'm talking about involved ever getting someone's password.

92
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:50,910
Rym: Every case is someone cloning your SIM card and then taking advantage of account recovery to then steal your accounts.

93
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,029
Scott: That happens also.

94
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,650
Rym: And that happens all the time because it's still not black screen, green text, evil genius.

95
00:05:56,951 --> 00:06:04,710
Rym: No, it's the fact that T-Mobile and Verizon and all those companies, they'll basically give any hobo off the street your phone.

96
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,969
Rym: Like, they'll clone your SIM and give it to a hobo with no ID.

97
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:16,950
Rym: And that's a big problem because a lot of websites, if you have a phone, you can usually recover, and I'm making air quotes, the account.

98
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,529
Rym: But anyway, that's happened to two people I know in the last week and a half.

99
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:26,604
Rym: And in both cases, it was the SIM card cloning situation.

100
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:28,270
Rym: And in both cases, it was Teemo.

101
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,530
Rym: But I saw another account of a friend of a friend that was Verizon.

102
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,476
Rym: So yeah, but that happened to Anime News Network.

103
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:42,370
Rym: So even as of Dateline right now, they still don't have the Anime News Network domain back.

104
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,276
Scott: Incompetent IT.

105
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:47,830
Scott: They did not take Geeknight's advice in advance.

106
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,442
Rym: I mean, the real problem is that...

107
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,330
Scott: If you get Geeknight's anything, you will not succeed.

108
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:57,443
Rym: I'll bet I could get a cloning or SIM card.

109
00:06:59,310 --> 00:06:59,631
Scott: Oh, no, no.

110
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:09,322
Scott: I'm saying you could not move the DNS for Frontruker.com, and you could not easily... I guess you might have passwords because I might have given them to you.

111
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:10,790
Scott: I don't know if your keys are on there.

112
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,190
Rym: I'm assuming I don't have passwords.

113
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:17,030
Scott: I mean, it's posted on Linode, which has a real two-factor, so good luck logging in.

114
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,970
Rym: And the Amazon stuff is also a real two-factor.

115
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,367
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

116
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,870
Rym: Do not construe what we just said as a challenge, you jerks out there.

117
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:32,750
Scott: I mean, it's not Fort Knox, but we basically do all the normal best practices that I tell everyone to do, and we haven't had a problem.

118
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:46,629
Rym: But anyway, if you tried to go to Anime News Network and you think it's down, you temporarily have to go to AnimeNewsNetwork.cc while they, I assume, sue or whatever to get their real domain back from the people who stole it from them.

119
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:52,990
Rym: So yeah, in other news, Scott went to FlameCon, as did Emily, and I biked around all day instead.

120
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:55,230
Scott: I wanted to bike around all day, but I went to FlameCon.

121
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,510
Rym: I should have gone to FlameCon.

122
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,746
Scott: So FlameCon, if you don't know, is a Comic-Con much like, say, MOCA, right?

123
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:02,870
Scott: It's not like newer Comic-Con.

124
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:08,990
Scott: However, it's a room full of, you know, it's basically an artist alley, really, right?

125
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:12,790
Scott: In one big room in a hotel, one hotel ballroom.

126
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,208
Rym: Like SPX or TKF.

127
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:27,810
Scott: It also had a gaming room, which was, like, at the level of, say, an Anime Boston gaming room, only a little more organized and, you know, bright, more brightly lit, and much more well advertised and patronized.

128
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:35,370
Scott: And also, it had a few panel rooms that were heavily scheduled, unlike, say, a MOCA, right?

129
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,309
Scott: You know, it had full panel schedules for all the days in there.

130
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:41,370
Scott: I think it's a two day, I'm pretty sure it's two days, Saturday, Sunday.

131
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,210
Scott: There was no Friday at this time.

132
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:51,330
Scott: So we went for, like, just a few hours to walk around and see all the tables because there were many people that I knew who had tables there.

133
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,910
Scott: There were a few tables with, like, super pro Marvel DC type people.

134
00:08:56,492 --> 00:09:00,310
Scott: You know, there were serious, for real, comic publishers there, right, with tables.

135
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:05,130
Scott: And the rest were mostly, you know, indie webcomic level people, you know.

136
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:08,589
Scott: But none of the, I didn't see a single booth there.

137
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:17,830
Scott: We usually go to one of these things and you see, like, the sad booth and it's like, wow, it's dude with, like, super sad comics that, you know, are really poorly drawn.

138
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:18,150
Rym: Yeah.

139
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,470
Scott: Not a one of those did I see, right?

140
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:31,090
Scott: The other thing about FlameCon, obviously, if you didn't guess by the name, is that it's a Comic-Con specifically for LGBTQ, et cetera, et cetera, you know, peoples, right?

141
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,570
Scott: That's not to say that every person selling comics there was, you know, non-straight.

142
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,550
Rym: Yeah, more than it's a focus for the convention.

143
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,890
Scott: That is the focus of the convention is purpose, right?

144
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:52,570
Scott: Even though not all of the content is that way, not all the creators are that way, but, you know, everyone there is obviously friendly in that regards, right?

145
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:55,630
Scott: No homophobes in the room, not one, right?

146
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,109
Scott: They would be very, very uncomfortable.

147
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,850
Scott: That would be like someone with arachnophobia going to the Spider-Con.

148
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:05,889
Scott: It wouldn't happen, you know, it's like the safest space.

149
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:08,830
Scott: And also because of that, right?

150
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:16,890
Scott: You know, compared to say a mocha, just the general atmosphere was way more friendly, way more energetic, way more happening.

151
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:29,790
Scott: And obviously it also, you know, some of the content, a significant percentage of it was obviously, you know, yuri, yaoi, sexy, erotic, et cetera, in some way.

152
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,789
Scott: But most of it wasn't.

153
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,929
Scott: It still wasn't even the majority, right, was that kind of stuff.

154
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:38,110
Scott: You know, and also that stuff is totally awesome anyway.

155
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:45,710
Rym: Emily went, she bought a whole bunch of comics and like met a bunch of people and it was sort of an extra power weekend because there was that play event the same weekend.

156
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:56,230
Scott: Yeah, the play NYC, which is, play NYC is like, it's a gaming con in New York, which is, you know, one of, you know, it's one of them, but it's not, it's the kind where you go to where there's...

157
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,010
Rym: Try a bunch of indie games.

158
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:04,870
Scott: There's a ton of indie game developers, all with tables all over the place showing off their indie games and not the kind where you can sit around playing board games, the kind we want.

159
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:05,929
Rym: Yeah, the kind that we're going to make.

160
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:08,450
Rym: But yeah, FlameCon is awesome.

161
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,050
Rym: The other thing that was awesome and combined, it meant that a lot of people were in New York last weekend.

162
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,085
Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:22,010
Rym: So if you're ever in New York, like if you want to, like if you had to choose between Mocha Fest and FlameCon in New York, I think FlameCon is the better con.

164
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,070
Scott: FlameCon, I think, yeah.

165
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,270
Scott: I mean, you're getting about as much time spent there, right?

166
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:28,747
Scott: It's at a better time of year, right?

167
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,430
Scott: August is certainly better than what, April or whatever.

168
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:32,470
Scott: It's warmer and nicer.

169
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,729
Rym: Yeah, but super nice out.

170
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,310
Scott: It's in, the only thing is it's in Brooklyn.

171
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,809
Scott: So if you're like touristing in Manhattan, Mocha is a more convenient location, I guess.

172
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:49,110
Scott: But yeah, it's like if I had to choose between the two, at least in their current states, I mean, Mocha's heyday is way better than the current of either two, right?

173
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,170
Scott: But Mocha has gone so far downhill and FlameCon exists.

174
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:55,070
Scott: So it's like, well, might as well go to the FlameCon.

175
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:02,810
Scott: I think FlameCon costs more money, but it doesn't matter because you're getting panel content if you actually stay at FlameCon, which Mocha has very little panel content.

176
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:04,229
Scott: Not much to speak of at all.

177
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:13,210
Scott: Whereas the FlameCon panel content, while I didn't go to any, I could tell from looking at the schedule and being a panel expert type person that it was quite excellent.

178
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:16,670
Scott: And it was in multiple rooms and lasted the whole con.

179
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:19,009
Scott: So, you know, it was worth, probably worth going to.

180
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,493
Rym: So the only reason I didn't go.

181
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:27,350
Rym: really was that because all these people were in town for the weekend, Ghost of Miami, we had the launch party because we launched it.

182
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,989
Rym: It's live.

183
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:29,650
Rym: You can buy Ghost of Miami.

184
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,749
Scott: What is Ghost of Miami?

185
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:35,449
Rym: It's a visual novel that's... Imagine visual novels set in like...

186
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:36,809
Scott: But I'm already dating dads.

187
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,143
Scott: Why would I go to this other group?

188
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,669
Rym: It's more like Phoenix Wright.

189
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:48,010
Rym: It's not just... It's like literally you're a PI in Miami in 1986 and you solve cases Phoenix Wright style.

190
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,729
Rym: Like, do you go check out the docs or talk to that shady dude?

191
00:12:52,511 --> 00:13:00,050
Rym: And you're always kind of torn between, on one hand, romancing the various people and on the other hand, actually solving the case.

192
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:01,822
Rym: And there's a lot of endings.

193
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:02,569
Rym: There's good stuff there.

194
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:15,110
Rym: I have a vested interest in this game succeeding, but also we had a really rocking after party after FlameCon and the play event at a bar called the Hinterlands in Brooklyn, like way out, like in Flatbush.

195
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:15,869
Scott: In the Hinterlands?

196
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,304
Rym: Yeah.

197
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,550
Rym: But one interesting thing about that bar that was actually pretty cool.

198
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:23,530
Rym: We went to it and we just wanted a quiet place, like hang out.

199
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:29,070
Rym: And I go in and it looks like there's a big crowd in the front and there's a guy with a microphone and it looks like it's going to be loud.

200
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,084
Rym: But then we get in and you know what's going on?

201
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:31,950
Rym: Trivia.

202
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,749
Rym: And you know what was notable about that trivia?

203
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,386
Rym: It was good and nerdy.

204
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,579
Scott: There's a lot of nerdy trivia out there.

205
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:40,410
Scott: There's an Astoria, there's multiple nerdy trivia.

206
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:47,810
Rym: Yeah, but like the bar, like the Baroness tried to do trivia a few times and they just... It was the, you can just stop trying to make this happen situation.

207
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,409
Rym: But at this bar, like these people were into this trivia.

208
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:51,671
Scott: Right.

209
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,930
Scott: That's the thing is you can't just have a trivia at a bar.

210
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:59,190
Scott: You need to actually create like a trivia community at the bar and certain bars have it and some don't, right?

211
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:06,930
Scott: So it's like, if you ask around, people will tell you, these are the bars that have the trivia where people come and they already have teams and they already have, you know, the shit going on.

212
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:07,431
Scott: Right.

213
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:09,656
Scott: And then you have to like join a team and be friends with people.

214
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:14,870
Scott: The thing is, uh, I'm not into trivia enough to want to do it more than like once in a while.

215
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,033
Rym: See, I think I'm not.

216
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:19,590
Rym: But then when I was there, like my quiz bowl blood came back.

217
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,279
Scott: Yeah, no, whenever there is a trivia, I'm like, oh baby.

218
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,530
Scott: But then it's like I couldn't do a trivia every week and we get old real fast.

219
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,717
Scott: And also I don't drink alcohol.

220
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:31,610
Scott: And most of the purpose of the trivia is to get you to go to a bar and drink alcohol.

221
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,391
Rym: Ah, it depends.

222
00:14:32,452 --> 00:14:39,830
Rym: So I often, when I did go to trivia, like when I used to do it a lot, I went to trivia at bars during the day.

223
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,602
Scott: You never see any bakery trivia, right?

224
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,730
Scott: It's always bar trivia.

225
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,310
Rym: Yeah, but I was like a teenager and I went to bars during the day where they did trivia and no one was drinking.

226
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:50,108
Scott: Anyway.

227
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,653
Rym: Anyway.

228
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:53,058
Rym: Otherwise, some other news.

229
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:56,250
Rym: I found this essay and I've been hanging out at the link for a long time.

230
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,470
Rym: And I just want to bring it up because Giant Robo.

231
00:14:59,351 --> 00:14:59,909
Scott: Uh, you and a Giant Robo.

232
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,155
Rym: Is one of my favorite anime.

233
00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:08,010
Rym: It's like, it's a fantastic, weird show that has a, like, if you think the show is weird.

234
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:08,604
Scott: Overrated.

235
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,413
Scott: Well, here's the thing.

236
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:19,130
Scott: Amongst people who don't know about Giant Robo or never heard of it or aren't like, you know, super anime fans who know about obscure shit, it's underrated.

237
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,141
Scott: But amongst people who know Giant Robo, it's overrated.

238
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:23,606
Scott: They act like it's the God of God.

239
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:24,590
Scott: anime is when it's just.

240
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,029
Rym: I think, I think it's in the top 10 or 15 though.

241
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:35,470
Rym: Because it's so unique and also the story of how it got made and why it got made.

242
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,460
Scott: Yeah, that's a great story.

243
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,370
Scott: It doesn't make the anime.

244
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,807
Rym: Also, it has one of the best, most operatic soundtracks I have ever seen.

245
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:42,470
Rym: Like the score.

246
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,070
Scott: No, it doesn't.

247
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:49,150
Rym: What anime has a more like motif driven operatic score?

248
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:51,088
Scott: Uh, Evangelion.

249
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,964
Rym: I would not call Evangelion's operatic.

250
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:54,829
Rym: It's a different style.

251
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:56,089
Scott: Uh, Escaflowne.

252
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,430
Rym: Uh, Escaflowne is more symphonic.

253
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,543
Scott: I mean, you're going to argue about music shit.

254
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,849
Scott: I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

255
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:03,890
Scott: I'm just saying.

256
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:10,670
Scott: The point is the soundtrack, whatever, even if you want to narrow it to saying it's the best in some specific genre, whatever, right?

257
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,810
Scott: It's not, I think Trigon has a better sound.

258
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:21,970
Rym: Giant Robo is one of those few things, much like the Matrix or Star Wars, where if I see any amount of it, I have a desire to just watch the rest of it from that point.

259
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:22,547
Scott: I do not.

260
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,070
Rym: Uh, so if you ever, if you're not like Scott and you actually have feelings, Gundam Shit has a better sound.

261
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:36,950
Rym: Read this essay because this essay I'm going to link to actually does a really good job of capturing what it is that I like so much about Giant Robo.

262
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,409
Scott: It was written by some Giant Robo fanboy.

263
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,790
Rym: No, this is actually a really like well-researched, uh, like well-written essay.

264
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,790
Scott: Someone who well-researched Giant Robo is a Giant Robo fanboy.

265
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:48,610
Rym: Uh, I don't know why you're so weirdly down on Giant Robo.

266
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,054
Scott: I'm not weirdly down on it.

267
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:53,206
Scott: I'm saying it's, oh, it's not, everyone makes out like it's so amazing.

268
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:54,130
Scott: It's only, aight.

269
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,189
Rym: I think you personally underrate it.

270
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:56,707
Rym: Nah.

271
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,376
Scott: I don't know.

272
00:16:58,457 --> 00:16:59,630
Rym: Giant Robo is real good.

273
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:09,369
Rym: And frankly, if you've never seen Giant Robo, if nothing else, just go find the first episode of it and watch it because it starts in the middle of a train chase.

274
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:12,630
Rym: And you don't even know who the good guys are, the bad guys or anything.

275
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:14,349
Rym: And it just escalates from there.

276
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,690
Scott: I finished it and I don't know who the good guys are, the bad guys or anything.

277
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,893
Scott: What?

278
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:17,950
Rym: It's really straightforward.

279
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:18,556
Rym: Uh-huh.

280
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,310
Rym: What do you think happened?

281
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,128
Scott: The bad guys are just too cool, so I got, they seem like good guys to me.

282
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:28,790
Rym: Yeah, well, the impact is the best good guy, bad guy in all the history of anime, possibly.

283
00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:29,242
Rym: No.

284
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,072
Rym: So, uh, yeah.

285
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:39,070
Rym: And in other minor news, uh, Scott's not watching it for some reason, but I've watched a whole ton of the Little Witch Academia show.

286
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,830
Scott: I know I got to pay for Netflix at the right time, you see, because in September there's going to be some South Park.

287
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:46,590
Scott: And then I'm going to pay for Hulu.

288
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:53,010
Scott: And once the South Park season ends, then, and if there's nothing to watch on Crunchyroll, then I'll pay for Netflix, right?

289
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,290
Scott: You see, you don't want to pay for more than one of these things at a time because then you're just throwing money in a giant pit of fire.

290
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,495
Scott: Might as well buy lottery tickets.

291
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:01,730
Scott: The lottery tonight is like a jillion dollars, still not buying tickets.

292
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,090
Rym: I just can't be bothered, so I just pay for Crunchyroll and Netflix and I just never stop paying for them.

293
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:09,210
Rym: Only Hulu do I start and stop based around South Park.

294
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,789
Scott: I only pay for the one I'm using at the time, so right now I'm only paying...

295
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,790
Rym: I use Netflix and Hulu equally all the time.

296
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,509
Scott: I'm only paying for Crunchyroll right now.

297
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:23,288
Rym: But anyway, Little Witch Academia, if you haven't actually seen like the original OAV...

298
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,490
Scott: Oh, and YouTube Red, but I always pay for YouTube Red because I watch YouTube more than anything.

299
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:27,410
Rym: I don't pay for YouTube Red.

300
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,590
Scott: I watch YouTube more than anything.

301
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,949
Rym: I just use Adblock for now.

302
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,350
Scott: I watch a lot of YouTube on device on the official YouTube app.

303
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,283
Rym: I only watch YouTube on TVs.

304
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,350
Rym: I never watch it mobile.

305
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,819
Scott: I watch it mobile frequently.

306
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,130
Scott: In bed with my iPad.

307
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:55,850
Rym: But usually, in the history of anime, if you have the situation where there's an OAV or a special or a movie that is good or fondly remembered, there might be some people who then take that and make a long, drawn out, bad TV show version of it.

308
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:56,429
Scott: Read or Die?

309
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,730
Rym: Tenchi Muyo, El Hazard vs El Hazard the Wanderer.

310
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:03,592
Scott: Pat LeBourg TV Season 2?

311
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:03,745
Scott: Yup.

312
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,610
Scott: It's not bad, but it's not as good as say Pat LeBourg OAV or Pat LeBourg movie or Pat LeBourg TV Season 1.

313
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,430
Scott: It is the opposite.

314
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:18,790
Rym: And I think the reason is, in this case, the TV show is what they wanted to make, but what the specials were was like the minimum viable.

315
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:24,930
Rym: They had to cram as much as they could into a tiny special and then they kickstarted a slightly less tiny special.

316
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,088
Rym: And then the show was, "Okay, now we're going to make what we actually wanted to

317
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:28,309
Rym: make.".

318
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:29,702
Rym: It is great.

319
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,569
Rym: And every episode just gets better.

320
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,390
Scott: How come Studio Trigger was able to get real anime and they didn't have to kickstart Kill la Kill?

321
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:41,430
Scott: They didn't have to kickstart, oh I guess Inferno Cop doesn't even need money.

322
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,663
Rym: They only kickstarted that second special.

323
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,970
Scott: Right, but why does Little Witch Academia need kickstarting where the other things didn't?

324
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:50,830
Scott: I don't know, whatever.

325
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:54,950
Scott: Didn't the original Little Witch Academia get kickstarted?

326
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:59,570
Rym: No, I'm pretty sure the original Little Witch Academia was part of that Young Animators project.

327
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:00,390
Scott: I don't remember.

328
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:05,610
Rym: It was a Young Animators training thing and it was made as sort of like an experimental film.

329
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,084
Scott: We'll see.

330
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,878
Scott: But anyway, the TV show is so great.

331
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:11,337
Rym: I'm sure it is.

332
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:12,090
Rym: I believe it.

333
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,550
Rym: And if you have fond memories of Mahou Tsekai Tai, this just picks up where that left off.

334
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,749
Scott: Mahou Tsekai Tai, better than Giant Robo.

335
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:28,929
Rym: I'd say Mahou Tsekai Tai, the original show, OAV, nothing after that, is nearly equal to Giant Robo.

336
00:20:30,554 --> 00:20:31,850
Scott: Definitely better than Giant Robo.

337
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,250
Rym: Not nearly as deep as Giant Robo.

338
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:38,767
Rym: Giant Robo being as deep as Big O.

339
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:41,950
Scott: And Big O is way better than Giant Robo.

340
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,930
Rym: I would say it is not better than Giant Robo.

341
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,730
Rym: It's not as well animated.

342
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:47,729
Scott: Significantly better.

343
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:59,238
Rym: Nah, I think Giant... The problem is, I can't talk about why I feel so strongly about these two differences without spoiling the ever-living hell out of Big O. And Big O is spoilable.

344
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:01,770
Rym: It's way deeper than you think it is if you haven't seen it all.

345
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:06,683
Rym: But anyway, if you have Netflix, just watch Little Witch Academia right now.

346
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:09,290
Rym: Skip any other anime until you have seen it.

347
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:10,170
Rym: It is so delightful.

348
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,882
Scott: It probably is the best anime to see at the moment.

349
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:14,790
Scott: that is an out now kind of thing.

350
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,540
Rym: It's girl-driven Harry Potter with magical delights.

351
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,384
Rym: Every episode is super unique.

352
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,448
Rym: I have nothing but praise for the show.

353
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:24,390
Rym: It's A anime.

354
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:32,280
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

355
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:40,120
Rym: So, many of you know that I, as a kid, was not just a fan of roller coasters like pretty much every kid is, but I was a roller coaster nerd.

356
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,420
Rym: Like, I know a lot about roller coasters and I get mad at the design of roller coasters.

357
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,305
Rym: Case in point, the Hollywood Rocket.

358
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:53,000
Rym: There's a reason that roller coaster feels weird because it was just a naively designed roller coaster, but I digress.

359
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:01,980
Rym: So, there was a rumor for a while recently because Cedar Point had, for a while, the tallest and biggest and fastest wooden coaster in the world.

360
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:05,893
Rym: Wooden meaning traditional cyclone-style roller coaster.

361
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:07,900
Rym: Like, flat metal slats.

362
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:09,679
Scott: It has rails just like a train does.

363
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:10,904
Rym: Not even.

364
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:13,194
Rym: So, they're not actually rails like a train.

365
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,380
Rym: That would be more like a steel coaster.

366
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:23,540
Rym: It has slat rails, meaning it's wood with thin, flat pieces of metal that are just laying there and the cars roll on top of it.

367
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,140
Rym: Rails, like on a train, have a rounded sort of beveled top and the wheels actually work very differently.

368
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,120
Rym: I'm not going to get into all the details of all that and what a steel coaster is, but anyway.

369
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,860
Scott: So, you could have a roller coaster where the structure of the roller coaster is completely made of wood.

370
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,420
Scott: All these wooden trusses and wooden... But it still counts as not wooden?

371
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,140
Rym: Yep, if you have steel tubes or steel rails that are not slat rails.

372
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,046
Scott: Yeah, I'm talking about wooden tracks.

373
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,440
Scott: It's a wooden structure, but the rails look like the subway train rails.

374
00:22:55,103 --> 00:22:56,380
Scott: That's not a wooden roller coaster?

375
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,120
Rym: That would be a steel coaster in most cases.

376
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:03,020
Rym: But anyway, the slat coasters are the ones that are known for a few things.

377
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,707
Rym: One, they're known for an old-timey feel.

378
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:07,380
Rym: They're known for giving you severe headaches if you ride them.

379
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,760
Rym: And they require insane amounts of maintenance.

380
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,480
Rym: So, Cedar Point had this gigantic... This roller coaster is so long it's stupid.

381
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:34,920
Rym: And they were shut it down, but a bunch of roller coaster nerds snuck into the park and were taking pictures and noticed that the executives of RMC, which is a company that's known for rehabilitating or rebuilding old wooden coasters, were meeting with Cedar Point officials on location.

382
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:43,180
Rym: And they finally announced and revealed recently, this video, my thing of the day, is a POV video of the render.

383
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,367
Rym: This isn't the coaster.

384
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:44,950
Rym: It's not done yet.

385
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,419
Rym: This is clearly a render of some kind.

386
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,140
Rym: Of what they're doing with this old wooden coaster.

387
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:54,180
Rym: They're turning it into a new kind of coaster called a hybrid coaster.

388
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:57,320
Rym: And it's going to be the tallest, fastest one in the world.

389
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:05,120
Rym: It's basically using the same old wooden superstructure, but the original coaster is an old DIN Corporation coaster.

390
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,220
Rym: It's like standard wooden coaster.

391
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:11,119
Rym: RMC is known for taking that and doing modern stuff.

392
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,527
Rym: So, if... What?

393
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:14,553
Rym: You don't like roller coasters?

394
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:16,060
Scott: You don't want to ride a roller coaster?

395
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,819
Scott: I just like rolling them, but I don't need to hear any of this.

396
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:20,099
Rym: That's the stuff I care about because I'm a nerd.

397
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,124
Scott: You go there and you ride.

398
00:24:21,144 --> 00:24:22,111
Scott: You don't care where they're made.

399
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,580
Scott: You go to the park, you ride everything.

400
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:30,740
Rym: No, I care about that a lot because if a coaster is not Intamin or B&M, odds are it's not great unless it's an old DIN coaster.

401
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,687
Scott: You paid to get into the park.

402
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:36,060
Scott: They don't charge you to ride all... You pay one price, you ride as much as you want, so ride everything.

403
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:43,560
Rym: You would be better off going to Cedar Point and just riding Millennium Force over and over and over again than you would be riding every coaster at some other parks.

404
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:46,500
Rym: I'll stand by that statement.

405
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,566
Rym: What's extra interesting to me... This is just a POV.

406
00:24:49,606 --> 00:25:01,600
Rym: You watch this and it's just crazy to watch it when you realize that it... This is what you could have done with a wooden coaster had this technology existed back when they were making wooden coasters.

407
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:08,700
Rym: When I was a kid, I would not have watched this video, though, because one thing that I was always afraid of was roller coaster spoilers.

408
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:10,860
Scott: That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

409
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,129
Scott: I don't even believe in movie spoilers.

410
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:15,000
Scott: You definitely know such a thing as roller coaster spoilers.

411
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,623
Scott: Guess what, guys?

412
00:25:15,643 --> 00:25:17,030
Scott: It goes up and then it goes down.

413
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:23,740
Rym: A big spoiler on this one is that wooden coasters do not have inversions.

414
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:30,120
Rym: This technology, the kind of hybrid they're making, this wooden coaster goes upside down a bunch of times.

415
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:31,299
Scott: Oh, no.

416
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,419
Rym: And the first hill is crazy because it's a 90 degree angle.

417
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,619
Scott: You're literally going straight down?

418
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,317
Rym: Straight down.

419
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:41,204
Scott: Okay.

420
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:43,080
Scott: For a very brief moment.

421
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:47,179
Rym: Yeah, even the tallest coasters are not going down for that long.

422
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,280
Rym: I mean... But yeah, next year, because I didn't get to go this year, I'm going to go to Cedar Point.

423
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:55,520
Rym: And this coaster actually looks like it's going to be really amazing.

424
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:02,660
Rym: And I don't mourn that Mean Streak is dead because Mean Streak literally gave me a splitting headache every time I rode it in my entire life.

425
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,604
Scott: Anyway, all right.

426
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,920
Scott: Now that we're done with Rym's roller coaster fanboy talk.

427
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:06,742
Scott: Right?

428
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:07,677
Scott: So I discovered this...

429
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,340
Rym: I thought you were going to say fetish for a second.

430
00:26:09,622 --> 00:26:10,479
Scott: Sure, that same thing.

431
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:14,700
Scott: I discovered this documentary yesterday, like someone linked to it somewhere.

432
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:23,940
Scott: And this is a documentary about something that I hadn't thought about in a long time, which is an old Ruby Spears cartoon that I only saw on Toonami.

433
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:30,980
Scott: I didn't see it when it was like, you know, out originally because I was like zero years old, called Thunder the Barbarian.

434
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:36,920
Scott: And the documentary is Lords of Light because Thunder used to always say Lords of Light during the show.

435
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,020
Scott: Anyway, if you don't know, Thunder the Barbarian is this cartoon that looks super old, like, you know, Hanna-Barbera style.

436
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:43,745
Scott: Right.

437
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:44,694
Scott: It's from the early 80s.

438
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:49,840
Scott: But and the plots of Thunder episodes were not really that great.

439
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,388
Scott: It was like, oh, it was a bad guy.

440
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:53,860
Scott: We got to fight, you know, rescue people, whatever.

441
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,221
Scott: Right.

442
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:55,323
Scott: Just really standard stuff.

443
00:26:55,764 --> 00:27:04,220
Scott: What was amazing about Thunder was that the setting of it was so ridiculous and so awesome and so ahead of its time.

444
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:04,523
Scott: Right.

445
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:06,460
Scott: You basically had this swords and sorcery deal.

446
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:06,701
Scott: Right.

447
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:07,583
Scott: He's a barbarian.

448
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:09,649
Scott: His companions are a monster.

449
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:13,260
Scott: that's a lot like a wookie and a magical wizard girl.

450
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:13,621
Scott: Right.

451
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:14,722
Scott: It's sort of like that.

452
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:25,320
Scott: And, you know, but what happened is the earth, this giant meteor comet or asteroid or something, went in between the earth and the moon like an enormous one.

453
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:26,285
Rym: Look at that.

454
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:27,780
Rym: That's New York getting volcanoes.

455
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:31,933
Scott: The moon broke in half and the earth like had all like.

456
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:34,220
Scott: it's like, you know, atmosphere sucked away.

457
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:35,228
Scott: Like it was like the end.

458
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:36,578
Scott: It was like super apocalypse.

459
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:36,800
Scott: Right.

460
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:41,320
Scott: And now the sword and sorcery wizards and monsters everywhere.

461
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:46,238
Scott: But also there's the old destroyed remnants of the 20th century.

462
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:52,040
Scott: But also there's all kinds of crazy sci fi space shit all together in this one place.

463
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:00,760
Scott: And it's like it was actually like, you know, that aspect of it, all the characters and the designs and the backgrounds and all this stuff like they went all out.

464
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,041
Scott: Right.

465
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:09,860
Scott: And like I didn't realize that huge names like Jack Kirby and Alex Toth and people like worked on like designing stuff for this show, even though.

466
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:10,562
Scott: Right.

467
00:28:10,642 --> 00:28:12,429
Scott: It's just it doesn't look that great.

468
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:15,340
Scott: You know, I mean, I guess it looked better than some of the other shows at the time.

469
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:20,200
Rym: I mean, look at shows contemporary to the show and they're all animated about the same level.

470
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:20,862
Scott: Yeah.

471
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:23,572
Scott: But it's like, you know, this show is really something special.

472
00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:25,780
Scott: In fact, it was ridiculously popular as well.

473
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,883
Scott: People don't realize that.

474
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:31,960
Scott: But it was cut to two seasons, mostly because, you know, I guess it was kind of violent.

475
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:32,241
Scott: Right.

476
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:36,040
Scott: It was a Saturday morning cartoon, but it was a little bit too much for the kids.

477
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,124
Scott: These barbarians.

478
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:39,855
Scott: So this show is really awesome.

479
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,740
Scott: This is documentary where the interview, all the people related to the show that were still alive when they made the documentary.

480
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,025
Scott: It's only a 20 minute deal.

481
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:48,266
Scott: Right.

482
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:51,660
Scott: And you learn all this stuff about, you know, what the deals of the show.

483
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:00,580
Scott: But really, they don't actually talk about Thunder itself that much because there isn't that much to say about a two season show with only a handful of episodes.

484
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:12,720
Scott: But they talk about, like, you know, the state of animation at the time and the way things were and all this other techniques and decisions that they made in the studio and all this stuff, some of which I've told you just now.

485
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:18,780
Scott: And that stuff is really fascinating and why this is worth 20 minutes of your time.

486
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:28,600
Scott: And also, if you're into that, I recommend watching at least one or two episodes of Thunder or the Barbarian because it's actually like it's some really awesome stuff there.

487
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,229
Rym: It's about as worth watching as I saw just clicking through this video.

488
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,100
Rym: Someone like rebuilt a battleship out of wood and was sailing it somewhere.

489
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:36,862
Scott: Oh, yeah.

490
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,365
Scott: It's like it's about as worthwhile.

491
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:39,167
Scott: It's it's not.

492
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:41,693
Scott: it's almost as worth watching as Fist of the North Star.

493
00:29:41,754 --> 00:29:42,596
Scott: I'd say almost.

494
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:44,039
Rym: That's high praise.

495
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:44,420
Scott: Yeah.

496
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,530
Scott: It's like, you know, you should probably watch Giant Robo first.

497
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:50,340
Scott: It Thunder the Barbarian is not as good.

498
00:29:55,122 --> 00:29:57,950
Rym: So in the moment, the Book Club book is apparently still Dune.

499
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,334
Rym: Oh, yeah.

500
00:30:00,176 --> 00:30:00,557
Scott: OK.

501
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:01,460
Scott: No, it's not.

502
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:06,268
Scott: The Book Club book is The Fifth Season by N.K.

503
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:06,690
Scott: Jemisin.

504
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,552
Scott: And I started reading it.

505
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:08,655
Scott: I'm already in like chapter three.

506
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:10,480
Rym: I'll probably read it on my way to and from Pax.

507
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:10,981
Scott: Yeah.

508
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:17,180
Scott: Ever since I decided to replace all of my playing of stupid phone games with reading, I'm reading a lot more.

509
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,910
Rym: And now that I've completely finished literally everything I could read related to the Prince of Nothing universe.

510
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:24,172
Rym: Now, I just got to wait.

511
00:30:24,232 --> 00:30:28,320
Rym: I literally know everything that any human could know other than our Scott Packer himself.

512
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,468
Rym: So I saw stuff and I know now I'm going to read this book.

513
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,280
Scott: Otherwise, so far this book living up to the hype already.

514
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:39,486
Rym: There won't be any nice next week because we're going to be a Pax.

515
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,269
Scott: Who knows about the week after.

516
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:46,659
Rym: there won't be any big nights the week after, because one, I don't get home from Pax till like Tuesday to Tuesday.

517
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,609
Rym: On Thursday, I'm flying to Salt Lake City and I'll be back like Sunday.

518
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:52,233
Rym: So two weeks, no GeekNights.

519
00:30:52,414 --> 00:30:54,720
Scott: But keep an eye on my YouTube channel.

520
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,742
Scott: I'm going to be making.

521
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:57,425
Scott: first of all, I'm planning to.

522
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:59,389
Scott: I'm promising it now so I don't mess it up.

523
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:00,151
Scott: Right.

524
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,253
Scott: Rym's got to cooperate.

525
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:01,493
Scott: Right.

526
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:04,780
Scott: We got to do live stream from Pax with my phone every day.

527
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,181
Scott: Oh, yeah.

528
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:06,022
Scott: At least one time.

529
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:06,703
Rym: I'm into that.

530
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:09,308
Scott: And then I'm going to bring my camera to Pax.

531
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:11,572
Scott: But not only am I recording whatever panel we do.

532
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:12,274
Scott: Right.

533
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:15,780
Scott: I'm going to be making video of like everything all the time.

534
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:21,953
Scott: And then hopefully at the end of every day in the hotel room on my iPad, I'm going to try to upload a video.

535
00:31:22,574 --> 00:31:24,880
Scott: Even we're even talking starting Thursday before Pax.

536
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,923
Rym: I tried to do that once.

537
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:29,485
Rym: I stopped caring like immediately.

538
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,466
Scott: I think I can do it.

539
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:31,527
Scott: I'm going to see if I can do it.

540
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:37,715
Scott: I've been like at other conventions, like at ConnectiCon, I did a bunch of videos like practice, but like I didn't upload any of that.

541
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:40,198
Rym: Remember in the old days, remember like every time?

542
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:40,979
Scott: I practiced enough.

543
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:41,680
Scott: Now we can do this.

544
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,108
Rym: I used to make those like what it's like at Pax videos.

545
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:50,580
Rym: And I think Pax West 2012 was the last time I made one of those.

546
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,762
Scott: No, we're not going to do it like that.

547
00:31:52,163 --> 00:31:54,869
Scott: But I want people to see like the itinerary.

548
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:55,129
Scott: Right.

549
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:00,300
Scott: Of like, you know, how we you know, what goes on in a day in a full day of Pax.

550
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:06,428
Scott: Not like here is the expo hall, but like, you know, this is our day at Pax, right?

551
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:09,111
Scott: Oh, we went to the Pike place and got this Chinese food.

552
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:13,477
Scott: Oh, and then we went to here, you know, we went to the tabletop and we stay here.

553
00:32:13,637 --> 00:32:15,940
Scott: We played this game and this game and this game and this game.

554
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:17,122
Rym: Yep.

555
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,785
Rym: We successfully.

556
00:32:18,825 --> 00:32:26,780
Rym: we successfully avoided ordering pizza because I've warned many people if at any point I say, hey, why don't we just order pizza and have it delivered to tabletop?

557
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,651
Rym: You have to slap me and remind me that every time we've done that, the pizza has been in edible garbage.

558
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:31,992
Scott: All right.

559
00:32:32,012 --> 00:32:35,260
Scott: So you need to follow all our YouTube channels and whatnot.

560
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:43,334
Scott: You need to keep an eye on also, you know, whichever you prefer, Twitch, YouTube for I'm going to be streaming stuff even when it's not Pax.

561
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:46,640
Scott: If Rym is not going to be here, I'll be playing games and planning to play West of Loathing.

562
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,303
Scott: That's the game I got on my queue.

563
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:48,924
Scott: Right.

564
00:32:48,944 --> 00:32:49,745
Scott: Because I'm way into that.

565
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,288
Rym: Maybe I'll try to live stream.

566
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:53,312
Scott: Ever since I saw it at Pax, I want to play it.

567
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:57,259
Rym: Maybe I'll mount my phone on my mountain bike or on my chest and try to live stream myself mountain biking.

568
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:57,920
Scott: Good luck with that.

569
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:02,006
Scott: What else should people come to our panel at Pax?

570
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:05,032
Rym: We're going to be on Sunday, September 3rd, six thirty p.m.

571
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:06,555
Rym: in the Hippogriff Theater.

572
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:09,260
Rym: It starts with an H, meaning it's in the Hyatt.

573
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:19,380
Rym: We're talking about the rage of the quitter, not the generic quitting panel we did before, but specifically the people who quit a game in a fit of butthurt rage.

574
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:21,908
Rym: How, why and what that means.

575
00:33:22,008 --> 00:33:25,660
Scott: And lastly, you should come to our forum, which is on our website for recruit.com.

576
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,185
Scott: Make sure when you apply, you write like a reason in the reason field.

577
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:31,228
Scott: that implies that you're actually a listener.

578
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:39,020
Scott: So I don't reject you and all the other social media places, Twitter, Facebooks, wherever it is that you know that you do.

579
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:39,921
Scott: Right.

580
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:40,783
Scott: Even Instagram.

581
00:33:40,803 --> 00:33:43,269
Scott: I'll start using the GeekNights Instagram also at Pax.

582
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,111
Rym: Oh, yeah.

583
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:44,612
Scott: Take that.

584
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:47,940
Scott: So I'll probably cross post to Twitter, though, or maybe even Facebook as well.

585
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:56,836
Scott: But anyway, when you go to those places, make sure to communicate with us and tell us, do you think it's a good idea for us to set up some stream of all geek?

586
00:33:56,856 --> 00:33:59,160
Scott: that's episodes is one long, never ending 50.

587
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,807
Rym: And don't just say yes.

588
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:04,040
Rym: Don't just say yes, because, you know, that'll be a pain in the ass for us to set it up.

589
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:10,768
Scott: Only say yes, if you would actually go to it and like use it like you would tune into it.

590
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:17,679
Scott: If you would view yourself would tune into that more than once just to see that it was a working thing, then say yes.

591
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,380
Scott: Otherwise say no.

592
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,565
Rym: So when I was a kid, I watched the hell out of DuckTales.

593
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:22,065
Rym: Oh, yeah.

594
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:25,393
Rym: Like Disney Afternoon was some of my favorite cartoons.

595
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,154
Scott: So it's weird.

596
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:29,340
Rym: It's like because when I was and I already was watching anime by that.

597
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,099
Scott: I know this is one of those things where it's like, you know, when I was a kid, you know, you get home and you watch certain things.

598
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,320
Scott: Right.

599
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,702
Scott: And there are certain things where it's like.

600
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,007
Scott: if someone asked you, like, what are you a fan of?

601
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:41,670
Scott: I would say something like Thundercats or Voltron.

602
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:41,871
Scott: Right.

603
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:42,012
Scott: Like.

604
00:34:42,032 --> 00:34:46,400
Scott: I wouldn't think like, oh, I'm a fan of like, you know, Goof Troop or whatever.

605
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:46,639
Scott: Right.

606
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,929
Scott: But it's like I. I watch Goof Troop every fucking day.

607
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:50,452
Scott: Yeah.

608
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:52,699
Rym: I watch DuckTales like every time it was on TV.

609
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,025
Scott: I watch DuckTales, Tailspin every fucking day.

610
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:57,007
Scott: I watch that shit.

611
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:57,548
Scott: Right.

612
00:34:57,768 --> 00:35:00,072
Scott: But I wouldn't think of like being a fan of it.

613
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:04,720
Scott: It wasn't something that I remembered or something I would set as my desktop wallpaper when I had a computer.

614
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,862
Scott: It's like, you know, it was gone.

615
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:06,283
Scott: It was gone.

616
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:13,800
Scott: And people don't know this, but even though I've told it before, but basically what happened was is the Disney Animation team.

617
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,681
Scott: There was something.

618
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:18,086
Scott: the executives there had the initiative to create original content.

619
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:18,366
Scott: Right.

620
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:20,650
Scott: And this is where the Disney afternoon came from.

621
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,933
Scott: It was syndicated to all your local TV networks.

622
00:35:23,474 --> 00:35:28,040
Scott: is those executives were pushing things like, you know, DuckTales, Goof Troop, et cetera, et cetera.

623
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,868
Scott: And as why did those things as great and amazing as they were, Chippendales, Rescue Rangers, et cetera, why did they end?

624
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:43,820
Scott: Because the executives who pushed that got kicked out and the new executives couldn't just carry on the successful projects of the previous executives.

625
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,842
Scott: They had to do their own thing.

626
00:35:46,263 --> 00:35:46,483
Scott: Right.

627
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:54,512
Scott: So this was around like, I guess, me, you know, sometime, I guess, mid to late nineties, I'm going to guess where they got.

628
00:35:54,532 --> 00:36:01,140
Scott: they pushed out those old shows and they put in basically shows based on, you know, the movies.

629
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,925
Scott: So they had like Aladdin, the TV show and Timon and Pumbaa, the TV show.

630
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:05,766
Scott: Yeah.

631
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:07,288
Scott: And those were not way.

632
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:12,595
Scott: No, those are bad shows compared to Disney afternoon, which was amazing and incredible.

633
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:16,060
Scott: So DuckTales went away at some point because of this.

634
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:31,700
Scott: And now many, many, many, many years later, like 20 plus years later, probably at least DuckTales is back by the same Disney XD kind of animation team that was doing like Gravity Falls stuff before.

635
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,045
Rym: Now, what's really important is they have an all star cast of voice actors.

636
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:40,114
Rym: It's like a who's who of storyboarders, writers, DuckTales.

637
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:40,394
Scott: Right.

638
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:44,080
Scott: Anyone you know, it's like 20 years is enough for people to become an adult.

639
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,111
Scott: So those people who are top voice actors now were DuckTales watchers.

640
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:51,320
Scott: So if you say, hey, you want to work on DuckTales, they're lining up to audition.

641
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:51,580
Rym: Yep.

642
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,608
Rym: Now I pirated basically all of the original DuckTales to watch a little bit to just be ready to compare.

643
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:04,740
Rym: And one thing I realized immediately is that despite the fact that I watched Hella DuckTales as a kid, I have not seen all of DuckTales by far.

644
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,525
Scott: There's a lot of episodes of old DuckTales.

645
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:07,127
Scott: How many are there?

646
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:08,090
Scott: What does the Internet say?

647
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,772
Rym: I don't even know.

648
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:09,915
Rym: I didn't have that Wikipedia up.

649
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:11,340
Scott: But like there's a lot.

650
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,422
Rym: DuckTales.

651
00:37:14,723 --> 00:37:17,649
Rym: That song's pretty much been stuck in my head since I was a kid.

652
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:18,391
Rym: A hundred.

653
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:19,052
Scott: A hundred.

654
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:22,680
Rym: So there's half a Sailor Moon's worth of old DuckTales.

655
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,721
Scott: I've watched all of this.

656
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:24,322
Scott: The North Star.

657
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,526
Scott: I could watch all of DuckTales if I wanted to.

658
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:27,247
Rym: I have all of it.

659
00:37:27,928 --> 00:37:29,571
Rym: And the new DuckTales like.

660
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:30,713
Rym: we'll talk about it in depth.

661
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:34,980
Rym: But if you need the TLDR version, it seems like it's great.

662
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:35,381
Scott: Right.

663
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:41,571
Scott: So there's basically on YouTube for free, legally, there is the full first episode, which is more than an episode.

664
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:42,974
Scott: It's like an intro movie deal.

665
00:37:43,014 --> 00:37:44,737
Rym: It's a two parter, basically.

666
00:37:44,777 --> 00:37:46,660
Scott: How long is like 40 minutes to an hour?

667
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,303
Rym: It's like two episodes with a like a cut in the middle.

668
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:50,285
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of long.

669
00:37:50,946 --> 00:37:52,247
Rym: And that's very pointedly.

670
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:55,832
Scott: But to watch more, I think you're going to need Disney XD or Pirate Bay.

671
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:56,453
Rym: Yeah.

672
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:57,094
Rym: Yeah.

673
00:37:57,515 --> 00:38:01,220
Scott: Or I think Disney left Netflix and is making their own streaming service.

674
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,381
Rym: That's going to be my news.

675
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:03,683
Rym: like the next Wednesday show.

676
00:38:03,843 --> 00:38:08,989
Scott: There's probably going to be the legal place to watch your DuckTales when it happens anyway.

677
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:18,139
Scott: So the new DuckTales show is different from the old DuckTales and in some ways better and in some ways arguably not better.

678
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,520
Scott: Who knows?

679
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,842
Rym: I don't think.

680
00:38:19,962 --> 00:38:25,369
Scott: I think if you're if you're a person who enjoys a duck, you should probably watch it regardless.

681
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:27,492
Rym: So here's there's the notable differences offhand.

682
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,616
Rym: It appears to be cleaving closer to the comics.

683
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,400
Scott: It is cleaving much, much closer to the comics.

684
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,181
Scott: The you know, the.

685
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:40,807
Scott: the true duck is the cannon duck stuff comes from Carl Barks.

686
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,769
Scott: If it's not Carl Barks, it's not canon.

687
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:45,511
Scott: But Don Rosa is basically canon.

688
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:47,433
Scott: I mean, I'll I'll say it's it's.

689
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:48,374
Scott: it's canon for me.

690
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:48,915
Scott: Yeah.

691
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:54,280
Scott: Because Don Rosa stays so close to Barks in fact, he calls them right on purpose.

692
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,242
Scott: So that's like someone intentionally trying to honor the canon.

693
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:04,107
Scott: Anything outside of that, including original DuckTales, any kind of weird Disney movies, Donald Duck and Magic Land, all this.

694
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:06,569
Scott: That's all non canon nonsense bullshit.

695
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:06,749
Scott: Right.

696
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:11,672
Scott: Carl Barks comics and Don Rosa comics is canon duck stuff.

697
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:22,780
Scott: And this DuckTales actually seems to try to some extent to pull from the Barks in facts, whereas the old DuckTales didn't seem to really give much shits about it at all.

698
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:27,065
Rym: It would like spiritually draw from them, but just go off on its own all the time.

699
00:39:27,185 --> 00:39:27,486
Scott: Oh, yeah.

700
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:28,567
Scott: It really had not much.

701
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:38,500
Rym: And this also shows in the art style because the backgrounds are more comic book and the opening theme is nothing but comic book backgrounds.

702
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:38,900
Rym: Yes.

703
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:45,805
Scott: You can see there are scenes like you can frames you can pull from this that you can then go to the comic and see the exact with the character.

704
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:49,647
Rym: styles are a much like modern stylized take that it looks a lot like.

705
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:50,048
Scott: What's that?

706
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,589
Scott: There's like a newer Mickey Mouse show that's on Disney.

707
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:53,190
Rym: Oh, yeah.

708
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,051
Scott: It looks a little bit more like that.

709
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,192
Scott: But it's not 100 percent like that.

710
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:59,334
Scott: But it's it's it's like towards that.

711
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:02,516
Rym: So it's got more lines and it's a little less abstract than that style.

712
00:40:02,576 --> 00:40:02,896
Rym: Yes.

713
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:03,237
Scott: Yes.

714
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,298
Scott: It's somewhere in between old DuckTales and that.

715
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:08,260
Rym: I think it's great, though, because this leads into the third big difference.

716
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,302
Rym: Huey, Dewey and Louie are different characters now.

717
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:12,823
Scott: Yes.

718
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:20,909
Scott: As far as a kid, I literally and this mostly seemed to focus on Dewey in these two episodes more than the other two.

719
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:21,749
Rym: Well, he's the evil one.

720
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:22,390
Scott: Sure.

721
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,431
Rym: I think that's just Louie.

722
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:25,312
Rym: I already I lost.

723
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:28,394
Scott: it felt to me like Dewey got more focused than the other two.

724
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:28,874
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:32,977
Scott: As if maybe he was more of a main character or maybe this was just his focus episode.

726
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,560
Rym: But in the original one, all the young dogs were basically just together.

727
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,242
Rym: One character like Ice Climbers and Smash Brothers.

728
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:39,682
Rym: Exactly.

729
00:40:40,082 --> 00:40:42,604
Scott: And they didn't even know which one was which in the old DuckTales.

730
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:42,824
Rym: Yeah.

731
00:40:42,864 --> 00:40:47,447
Rym: But the new DuckTales clearly and they didn't like dive into it like this one's like this.

732
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,128
Rym: This one's like this.

733
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:51,510
Rym: They just they act differently and they have different personalities, different voices.

734
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:57,514
Rym: And I feel like the girl duck is going to serve a similar girl.

735
00:40:57,754 --> 00:40:58,295
Scott: What's her name?

736
00:40:58,355 --> 00:40:59,015
Rym: I already forgot.

737
00:40:59,636 --> 00:40:59,956
Scott: Me, too.

738
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:02,137
Rym: I don't remember most of the people's names at this show.

739
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,398
Rym: There's Launchpad.

740
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:06,020
Scott: I only remember their names if they were in the old DuckTales.

741
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,924
Rym: I remember Glomgold from the old DuckTales.

742
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:10,426
Scott: So let's talk about Glomgold.

743
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:10,646
Scott: Right.

744
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:12,729
Scott: So people don't know this in the original comics.

745
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,293
Scott: Glomgold is a bower from South Africa.

746
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:20,480
Scott: They changed it in DuckTales to make him also Scottish like Scrooge McDuck.

747
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,322
Scott: Yeah, because apartheid.

748
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,947
Scott: And they don't want to have to whatever in the new DuckTales.

749
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:28,651
Scott: They had the opportunity to make him South African again.

750
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:30,754
Scott: And they've clearly put some effort.

751
00:41:30,794 --> 00:41:35,460
Scott: The people who are making the new DuckTales clearly have read Karl Barks comics and are trying to pay respect.

752
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,541
Rym: Webby, that's her name.

753
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:36,882
Scott: Right.

754
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:46,754
Scott: But they still left Glomgold, Flintheart Glomgold as a Scottish duck and not as a South African duck when they had the opportunity to change it back.

755
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:52,060
Scott: And that's slightly bullshit, but not the biggest deal, but also just kind of annoying.

756
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,062
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time.

757
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:56,507
Scott: Also, most people won't notice, but I fucking notice.

758
00:41:56,907 --> 00:41:57,849
Rym: I don't care that much.

759
00:41:57,909 --> 00:42:01,234
Scott: Also, it's probably better as someone with a shelf full of duck comics.

760
00:42:01,294 --> 00:42:02,195
Scott: I noticed.

761
00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:02,596
Rym: Yeah.

762
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:05,300
Scott: Most people don't even have one duck comic, let alone a shelf.

763
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,729
Rym: One, it lets them just forget about the problems of South African bars.

764
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:15,400
Rym: And two, it lets them be a little more loose in like what time this is actually set in.

765
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,704
Scott: Oh yeah, it's definitely set in like way more like the current 21st century.

766
00:42:19,724 --> 00:42:20,645
Scott: Yeah.

767
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:21,786
Scott: Which is like, okay.

768
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:23,948
Rym: His character would make less sense today.

769
00:42:23,968 --> 00:42:26,331
Scott: I mean, if you talk about like, it's weird, right?

770
00:42:26,371 --> 00:42:31,897
Scott: It's like, because the story of Scrooge, like he made all his money in the Yukon, like competing with Flintheart.

771
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:35,140
Scott: Well, it's like, oh, well, if he was in the Yukon, then he'd be dead.

772
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:36,621
Rym: Yeah.

773
00:42:37,581 --> 00:42:44,727
Rym: But also the, the fact that he's the second richest duck in the world and he's also the second richest Scottish duck in the world.

774
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:50,271
Rym: It kind of sets up a better, like current rivalry without needing backstory to be explained.

775
00:42:50,591 --> 00:42:50,771
Rym: Yeah.

776
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:52,372
Rym: Like it's, it's pretty self evident.

777
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,934
Rym: And also he's, he's a good mix.

778
00:42:55,094 --> 00:43:02,820
Rym: the way they've portrayed him here as evil and as incompetent and sometimes competent as he was in the original DuckTales cartoon.

779
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,280
Scott: Yeah.

780
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:10,045
Scott: I mean, in DuckTales, you know, the villains were a lot more, you know, wacky and, and sort of like insane, no bad guys.

781
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:15,208
Scott: Flintheart Glomgold isn't really kind of like, you know, he's not like maniacal right in the comics.

782
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:15,609
Rym: Yeah.

783
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:19,111
Rym: And in the show he's more just like kind of evil and really hate Scrooge.

784
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:19,511
Scott: Yeah.

785
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:21,433
Rym: He's murderous though.

786
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:22,213
Rym: He's willing to kill.

787
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,194
Scott: Oh, I'm sure.

788
00:43:23,354 --> 00:43:23,514
Scott: Right.

789
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:23,894
Scott: Whatever.

790
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:26,216
Scott: Um, yeah.

791
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,577
Scott: What else is there to say about this?

792
00:43:27,757 --> 00:43:29,258
Rym: It's very, very important.

793
00:43:29,278 --> 00:43:32,340
Rym: I think that that's not all that, that they got the original theme song.

794
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,183
Rym: And re-performed it because that really sets the continuity.

795
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:40,305
Rym: That's the kind of thing where if they hadn't used a different song, no one would have let that go.

796
00:43:40,605 --> 00:43:46,149
Scott: They also sort of redo the sort of, um, you know, like origin story.

797
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:46,790
Rym: It's tighter.

798
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:49,311
Rym: They, they immediately like, here's the characters set it up.

799
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:49,832
Scott: Go.

800
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:53,594
Scott: It's not an origin story of any of the characters individually.

801
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:56,656
Rym: It's the origin story of Scrooge resuming his biz.

802
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:56,776
Rym: Right.

803
00:43:56,816 --> 00:43:58,678
Scott: It's the origin story of DuckTales.

804
00:43:58,738 --> 00:44:05,002
Scott: Like, okay, well how did they end up in this situation where all the nephews are always hanging out with Scrooge going on adventures?

805
00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:05,602
Scott: Right.

806
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:07,223
Scott: It wasn't always that way.

807
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:09,064
Scott: The nephews were living with Donald before.

808
00:44:09,185 --> 00:44:10,565
Scott: And it's very artfully done.

809
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:19,471
Rym: how when you watch the, the like pilot episodes, they don't play the opening theme until the halfway point when DuckTales properly begins.

810
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:26,476
Rym: The first episode is like the prequel and then the first episode is like episode zero and one and you get the song halfway through.

811
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:33,621
Rym: And I got to say, when the song came in, it gave me that tiny little nostalgia chill that I so rarely get from a good reboot.

812
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:35,582
Scott: That's what the point of this is.

813
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:36,343
Scott: That's the nostalgia.

814
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:36,903
Scott: No one's making.

815
00:44:36,983 --> 00:44:46,590
Rym: Also, another big difference instead of just Donald is away in the Navy, which I think was mostly done in the original because there was a point in the original where Donald was no longer was there again.

816
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,830
Rym: Not, not, not much though.

817
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:59,358
Scott: I definitely remember watching DuckTales episodes where Donald Duck was there and I don't really remember them ever explaining like why he wasn't there or why he came back or why he left or anything like that.

818
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:00,739
Rym: I remember as a kid, I did.

819
00:45:00,759 --> 00:45:02,880
Scott: There were just some episodes where he was there and some episodes.

820
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,744
Rym: As a kid, I didn't know where he was and I didn't even know he was in the show for a long time.

821
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:10,125
Rym: And then there was like a throwaway, like something, something.

822
00:45:10,145 --> 00:45:12,547
Rym: He's in the Navy, like they had a letter from him or something.

823
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:13,908
Rym: I was like, oh, I don't remember that.

824
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:15,109
Scott: All I remember was him being there.

825
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,549
Scott: He was in the Navy and not being there.

826
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,810
Rym: He was like just in the Navy.

827
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:18,171
Scott: Okay.

828
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:32,280
Rym: But I feel like the main reason they did that in DuckTales was because his voice does not work for any amount of exposition or significant dialogue and just getting rid of him.

829
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,623
Rym: We've made it a lot easier in the new show.

830
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:36,806
Rym: They've toned him down, but not that much.

831
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:41,213
Scott: There was, there was at least one point where I couldn't understand what the fuck he was saying, which I'm like, oh, they did a good job.

832
00:45:41,293 --> 00:45:41,493
Rym: Yeah.

833
00:45:41,593 --> 00:45:43,376
Rym: But now he's going to be in the show.

834
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:46,280
Rym: And basically there's this one character who has a speech impediment.

835
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,480
Scott: Right.

836
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:51,206
Scott: The one thing though, I do want to say about the voice acting right is obviously all the voices are different.

837
00:45:51,226 --> 00:45:53,248
Scott: It's not the original voice actors for anything.

838
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:53,509
Rym: Yep.

839
00:45:53,669 --> 00:45:54,670
Rym: Which I think is good.

840
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,391
Rym: Which is fine.

841
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:56,913
Scott: It's just, I got no problem with that.

842
00:45:57,053 --> 00:46:03,722
Scott: But, and it's like, you know, at first because I'm used to the old voices, if you're not used to the old voices, it won't matter to you at all.

843
00:46:03,742 --> 00:46:04,102
Scott: There are all.

844
00:46:04,123 --> 00:46:05,044
Scott: the voice acting is great.

845
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:05,444
Scott: Right.

846
00:46:05,705 --> 00:46:16,540
Scott: But if you're used to the old ones, the weird thing is that I was able to basically like as soon as any character talked for the first time, it felt off because my brain was not matching it up.

847
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,940
Scott: Right.

848
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:22,788
Scott: But then the second time most of them talked like the second time any of the nephews talked, I completely forgot that it was.

849
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:29,276
Rym: And in fact now, because I went back and watched an episode of the original DuckTales, those original voices, I cannot deal with them anymore.

850
00:46:29,337 --> 00:46:31,880
Scott: Except for the voice of Scrooge himself.

851
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,142
Scott: I think it's fine.

852
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:34,665
Scott: I mean, no, there's nothing wrong with it.

853
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:40,396
Scott: I'm just saying personally, I was able to get used to and completely forgot that all the other voices changed.

854
00:46:40,457 --> 00:46:40,757
Rym: True.

855
00:46:40,877 --> 00:46:42,120
Scott: Except for the Scrooge voice.

856
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,668
Scott: Every time Scrooge talked, even though there's nothing wrong with the voice acting itself, it's still.

857
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:55,840
Scott: I got that feeling like wrong voice alarm every single time he talked, because I guess it's different, more or different in such a way.

858
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,361
Scott: I don't know.

859
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:59,325
Scott: But like listening to it, I'm like, there's nothing wrong with it.

860
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:01,027
Scott: It's just this alarm.

861
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:05,353
Scott: And my brain went off like wrong voice with that character design.

862
00:47:05,473 --> 00:47:08,136
Scott: And it stopped going off for every other character.

863
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:10,900
Scott: In fact, it never even went off once or stupid launch pad.

864
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,806
Scott: But it went off for Scrooge every single time he talked.

865
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:19,414
Scott: And I'm like, I please stop going off because I don't hate this voice acting.

866
00:47:19,535 --> 00:47:22,500
Scott: But it just my brain was like, it's the wrong voice.

867
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:22,861
Rym: Yeah.

868
00:47:22,901 --> 00:47:25,167
Rym: For some reason, I got a natural transition.

869
00:47:25,268 --> 00:47:26,451
Rym: Scrooge just sounded fine.

870
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:27,775
Rym: And then I watched the original.

871
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:28,858
Rym: He also sounded fine.

872
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:29,580
Rym: Just a little rougher.

873
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:42,400
Rym: Well, I guess the writing is where it's really different because the dialogue in the old DuckTales from everyone other than the boys and Webb and the girl, like the young ducks were like fine.

874
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:49,834
Rym: But the kids pretty much only ever said, my, my, my uncle Donald adventure, but my, my uncle Donald.

875
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:53,220
Rym: And like the writing was that for those characters, actually not that great.

876
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:57,505
Rym: The writing in this new show is fantastic.

877
00:47:57,565 --> 00:48:00,489
Rym: The character interactions and dialogue and all this sort of subtle stuff.

878
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:08,780
Rym: I guess the way I describe it is that the beats of the show are much denser and are much more to a modern sensibility and modern quality.

879
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,182
Rym: There's more jokes.

880
00:48:10,383 --> 00:48:11,606
Rym: There's more interactions.

881
00:48:11,826 --> 00:48:13,330
Rym: There's more plot moving quicker.

882
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:16,740
Rym: There's less dialogue, exposition and more show.

883
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,543
Scott: Nothing in the old DuckTales was very little.

884
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:20,764
Scott: was character driven, right?

885
00:48:20,885 --> 00:48:23,047
Scott: It was all plot driven, right?

886
00:48:23,428 --> 00:48:25,971
Scott: Are they, they have to go and rescue the thing.

887
00:48:26,011 --> 00:48:27,332
Scott: They have to get the treasure.

888
00:48:27,452 --> 00:48:28,334
Scott: Are they going to get it?

889
00:48:28,374 --> 00:48:33,720
Scott: All the characters are just who they were and they didn't change or have internal struggles or anything.

890
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,704
Rym: This one is clearly.

891
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:37,400
Rym: every one of these characters is going to have their mini arcs.

892
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:47,580
Scott: All of every character here you can see has some sort of, you know, thing to get over, you know, just like any other modern show has all the characters.

893
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,912
Rym: Like why did Donald and Scrooge stop adventuring?

894
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:50,616
Rym: Like what happened?

895
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,300
Rym: And who's that lady?

896
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,001
Scott: Right.

897
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:54,507
Scott: Look at the gravity falls that this replaced, right?

898
00:48:54,587 --> 00:48:55,189
Scott: Effectively.

899
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:59,440
Scott: It's on the same TV channel and some of the same people are working on it.

900
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,719
Rym: And I feel like Webby is just going to be a toned down version of Mabel, which I'm fine with.

901
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:13,400
Scott: I mean, Webby, first of all, right, is like super badass for some reason, which is totally, it's like, which is great because everyone else except Scrooge is not super badass.

902
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:13,961
Rym: Yep.

903
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:14,668
Rym: Do he?

904
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:15,073
Rym: Do he?

905
00:49:15,234 --> 00:49:15,760
Rym: He's not badass.

906
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,020
Scott: All the nephews are super crappy.

907
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,819
Rym: Donald, Donald's secretly badass.

908
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,730
Scott: Donald is secretly badass.

909
00:49:22,911 --> 00:49:25,020
Scott: Launchpad is accidentally badass.

910
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:25,762
Rym: Yep.

911
00:49:26,104 --> 00:49:26,667
Rym: Oh, the maid.

912
00:49:26,728 --> 00:49:28,740
Rym: The maid clearly is a spy or something.

913
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:29,806
Scott: Yeah, sure.

914
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,280
Scott: He's not your secretary.

915
00:49:31,461 --> 00:49:31,681
Scott: Yeah.

916
00:49:32,162 --> 00:49:38,460
Scott: Um, but yeah, also this has less, at least for now, it has less characters than old DuckTales.

917
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:43,020
Rym: I think that's just because the old DuckTales had few characters early on and they slowly introduced them all.

918
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,489
Scott: They kept adding tons and tons of characters, right?

919
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:48,400
Scott: So you'd get like, uh, Gyro Gearloose.

920
00:49:48,783 --> 00:49:49,779
Rym: I'm sure we'll get him.

921
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:55,140
Scott: Some Gizmo Duck and you know, there could even be some Darkwing Duck, who even knows, right?

922
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:56,967
Scott: But none of that is here.

923
00:49:56,987 --> 00:49:59,340
Scott: There wasn't even, you know, that's the only thing.

924
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:03,739
Scott: There wasn't a single goddamn Beagle Boy in this whole fucking thing.

925
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:05,700
Rym: Uh, they're in the trailer in the opening.

926
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,219
Scott: I'm sure they're there and they're just not in episode one or two.

927
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:09,844
Rym: Of course not.

928
00:50:09,864 --> 00:50:11,700
Rym: You're not going to have every villain in every episode.

929
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:16,140
Rym: That's literally why the Marvel movies have a thing that bothers me.

930
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,324
Scott: But the thing is Beagle Boy.

931
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:21,980
Scott: in, in DuckTales, the old DuckTales was the number one bad guy.

932
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:24,960
Scott: The same way that like Mojo Jojo is the number one bad guy in Powerpuff Girls.

933
00:50:25,206 --> 00:50:25,320
Scott: Yeah.

934
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:28,759
Scott: But in the comics, Flintheart is number one bad guy.

935
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:34,679
Scott: And that is yet another indicator of how they're, you know, caring a lot about those old comics.

936
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:42,159
Scott: Whereas if you were just remaking DuckTales and you only saw DuckTales, the TV series, and didn't read any comics, you would, Beagle Boys would be your first guys.

937
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:42,892
Scott: No.

938
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:43,097
Scott: Yeah.

939
00:50:43,822 --> 00:50:46,740
Rym: I did like the villains that were hired by Glomgold.

940
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:54,242
Scott: Like, I feel like they weren't just, you know, faceless, do nothing, you know, uh, henchmen, right?

941
00:50:54,283 --> 00:50:56,380
Scott: They were actually, they made them somewhat interesting.

942
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,240
Rym: Which Gravity Falls, you know, had the same thing.

943
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,119
Rym: Whenever they brought in a side character, like that time traveling guy, they always gave him a deal.

944
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,441
Rym: Yeah.

945
00:51:02,482 --> 00:51:04,660
Scott: By giving them like that tiny deal to them.

946
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,419
Scott: But you know that there's just that little bit that they had, you know, like someone was like a super knife-y person.

947
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:16,679
Scott: It's like just giving them that little bit of story and character and uniqueness gives me the opportunity to bring them back.

948
00:51:17,462 --> 00:51:18,599
Scott: The, if you ever need to.

949
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:28,380
Rym: The humor is also very dense and there's a lot of sort of like front of the screen jokes, but there's also a lot of subtle or back of the screen jokes.

950
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:29,679
Rym: There's just little things.

951
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:36,358
Rym: I think my favorite little bit is when the boys figure out that Scrooge is their uncle or like related to them.

952
00:51:36,378 --> 00:51:36,520
Rym: Great.

953
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,040
Rym: And they just, they jump around in the car and then there's the roll over the top of the car.

954
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,560
Scott: Someone made a gif of that where they continue to just infinite loop over the top of the car.

955
00:51:47,881 --> 00:51:51,920
Rym: And there's so many just little subtle jokes and interactions.

956
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,099
Scott: Like when he hits the gong and he's like, no, I won't release the thing unless you hit it through, you've already hit it.

957
00:51:58,222 --> 00:52:01,260
Rym: I laughed out loud numerous times during this.

958
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:01,978
Scott: It's a funny show.

959
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:02,501
Rym: Yeah.

960
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:06,060
Rym: I feel like this is going to be one of my favorite current animated shows.

961
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,460
Rym: Like bar none.

962
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:14,320
Scott: I'm not going, I don't think, partially because the ways to get this, I probably need to pay for the Disney streaming or pirating.

963
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:18,320
Scott: I see myself not watching every episode as it comes out.

964
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:22,680
Scott: I see myself shotgunning it all later, waiting much like with gravity falls.

965
00:52:22,841 --> 00:52:26,200
Scott: When the seasons ended, it became easy to download a full season.

966
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:31,460
Scott: So like what I've, what I did with adventure time, this isn't going to be a thing where there's new episode every week forever.

967
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:32,780
Scott: It's going to be a seasonal thing.

968
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,398
Scott: I imagine.

969
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:33,878
Rym: Yeah.

970
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,220
Rym: But I think it'll be like, uh, they'll keep making seasons for a long time.

971
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,120
Scott: Hope they keep making seasons for a long time.

972
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,699
Scott: But the question is how many seasons will they make?

973
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:42,340
Scott: Right.

974
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:42,829
Rym: Yep.

975
00:52:43,302 --> 00:52:48,260
Scott: Well, they aim for an ending or will they go for a hopefully, you know, continuous never ending.

976
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,640
Rym: So they already, they already confirmed a second full season is paid for.

977
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,180
Scott: I assume two definitely.

978
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:58,940
Scott: I'm asking, is it going to be two or is it going to be 10 or 20?

979
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,636
Rym: They said, they said something to the effect of each season that they do.

980
00:53:03,038 --> 00:53:06,020
Rym: will one, have an overarching plot.

981
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,659
Scott: So they can end on any end of any season.

982
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,580
Rym: But two will have many sub arcs within.

983
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:13,880
Rym: So it can still be reasonably episodic.

984
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,560
Scott: But so they're going to try to make it so that if any season ends, they'll have a good ending.

985
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:28,460
Rym: Actually, they still, they implied from what I read that the goal there is more to, even if the episodes are all monster of the week, which they really want to keep that monster of the week for the most part.

986
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:35,640
Rym: You have to be, they want to be able to in every monster of the week episode, push forward a meta plot of some kind.

987
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,119
Rym: Or the sailor moon formula.

988
00:53:38,287 --> 00:53:38,456
Rym: Yeah.

989
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:43,120
Rym: Sailor moon is monster of the week, but tiny revelation almost every episode.

990
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:43,908
Scott: Yeah.

991
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:50,179
Rym: But with adventure time and Steven universe, what I've been doing is just buying it on Amazon.

992
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:51,018
Scott: Not buying.

993
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,039
Scott: Well, how much does it cost?

994
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:54,897
Rym: Uh, it ends up being like 15 bucks a season.

995
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:55,219
Rym: ish.

996
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,300
Scott: How many seasons are there of Steven universe?

997
00:53:58,005 --> 00:53:58,578
Rym: Uh, six.

998
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,879
Rym: The way they break them down.

999
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,119
Rym: Cause it's weird how they break them down.

1000
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,558
Scott: 90 bucks.

1001
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,740
Rym: I don't care the big, the big value.

1002
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,300
Scott: Do they have like literally every episode on there?

1003
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:14,040
Scott: So if I pay money on Amazon to buy, I can see even the newest, newest episodes.

1004
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:22,560
Rym: So when an episode of Arizona TV, like for adventure time or Steven universe, it'll usually be on the Amazon season within like a couple of days.

1005
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,920
Scott: So if I buy the current season, they keep adding the new episodes to it as they air.

1006
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,879
Scott: And I don't have to keep paying.

1007
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:28,372
Scott: Yes.

1008
00:54:29,262 --> 00:54:36,940
Scott: So if I buy the newest season of, if, if, if Ducktales were on Amazon and I were to buy season one right now, I'd be able to watch this episode.

1009
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:43,380
Scott: And as soon as episode two came out, like the next day it would be there and I would have already paid for it and thus be able to watch it.

1010
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,920
Rym: That's how I've been watching adventure time and Steven universe.

1011
00:54:46,601 --> 00:54:51,438
Rym: And because it's not a streaming service, the fact it's just there forever in the Amazon account.

1012
00:54:51,983 --> 00:54:53,779
Rym: So I could watch it again or whatever.

1013
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,434
Scott: And that, that actually is, can they take, they can't take it down because you bought it.

1014
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,180
Rym: If they take it down, they got to give me my money back cause I paid for it.

1015
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:01,620
Rym: That's right.

1016
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:01,978
Scott: Okay.

1017
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:02,480
Scott: Interesting.

1018
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:02,960
Rym: Yeah.

1019
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:04,360
Rym: So that's how I'm watching a lot of cartoons.

1020
00:55:04,722 --> 00:55:10,659
Rym: I hope they also just sell this on Amazon at some point, but I don't know if they will probably get even the new Disney thing.

1021
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,070
Scott: Yep.

1022
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,680
Scott: Disney pulled out of Netflix and they're setting up their own thing.

1023
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,925
Rym: Disney's really on.

1024
00:55:15,427 --> 00:55:18,900
Scott: what you're going to do is once a year for like a month or two and there's nothing else to watch.

1025
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:27,179
Scott: Like in the summer, you're going to pay for the Disney stream and watch all your Disney for the year and then cancel it and then come back again.

1026
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:28,580
Scott: Right.

1027
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:34,280
Scott: For some more like, you know, like when the new Pixar movie that you didn't go see in the theater last year gets put up on that system.

1028
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,399
Scott: You're going to pay for it.

1029
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:35,818
Scott: Watch it.

1030
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,679
Scott: Turn, you know what?

1031
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,138
Scott: Turn it off.

1032
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:37,778
Scott: Something like that.

1033
00:55:39,021 --> 00:55:42,058
Rym: So yeah, uh, we didn't obviously talk a lot about what happened in the episode.

1034
00:55:42,099 --> 00:55:42,738
Rym: cause just watch it.

1035
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,257
Rym: It's free.

1036
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:44,658
Rym: Just watch it.

1037
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:46,612
Rym: And then you're probably gonna want to watch the rest of it.

1038
00:55:46,693 --> 00:55:49,396
Rym: cause the show, it looks like it's going to be really, really great.

1039
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,096
Scott: Like it is, this is good.

1040
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,240
Scott: This is taking over my gravity falls slot cause gravity falls ended.

1041
00:55:54,503 --> 00:55:54,571
Scott: Yep.

1042
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:58,440
Rym: I think based on that first episode too, I really like gravity falls.

1043
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:02,858
Rym: I think both Steven universe and adventure time are much better shows than gravity falls was.

1044
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,447
Scott: Uh, I mean adventure time.

1045
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:09,438
Scott: probably, I haven't watched enough Steven universe, but I wouldn't argue.

1046
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,440
Rym: Steven universe would be in my top 10 anime if I included it in anime.

1047
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,438
Scott: I don't know about that.

1048
00:56:16,521 --> 00:56:17,160
Rym: It's good.

1049
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,680
Rym: You have not got, it's gotten subtle and good and there's good stuff in Steven universe.

1050
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,460
Rym: You should watch it.

1051
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:41,138
Rym: Sure there is, but I, you know, but adventure time ekes them all out partly because it's so long and so utterly experimental and varied yet still having a relatively contiguous and like self-consistent plot that is building up to a real conclusion as I'm watching the last season.

1052
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:49,080
Rym: Like, you know, like the Lich stuff like is really like, it seems to be resolving why the Lich is a recurring villain in every time.

1053
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:56,020
Scott: Adventure time is a in currently in hanging out with my web comics as soon as the last very, very extreme guaranteed.

1054
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,540
Scott: This is the end of adventure.

1055
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,299
Scott: Time is out.

1056
00:56:58,721 --> 00:57:02,340
Scott: I'm going to go back to where I left off and go and go straight to the end.

1057
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,680
Rym: When you do that, I might just watch it all again because it's from the beginning.

1058
00:57:06,045 --> 00:57:06,278
Scott: Sure.

1059
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,759
Scott: From episode one of it.

1060
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,334
Rym: Maybe I'll skip season one.

1061
00:57:11,808 --> 00:57:12,178
Scott: I don't know.

1062
00:57:12,481 --> 00:57:13,939
Rym: I could start when the Lich appears.

1063
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,627
Scott: Well, I mean, if you want to, if you want to start from season one, I could do that too.

1064
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,519
Scott: We could do it together.

1065
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:31,360
Rym: But this DuckTales, I feel like will be definitely better than Gravity Falls and has the potential to be almost as good as the collected run of adventure time.

1066
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,838
Rym: But I do not think this format could be better than adventure time.

1067
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,544
Scott: Good

1068
00:57:36,564 --> 00:57:37,850
Rym: goal because adventure time again,

1069
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,140
Scott: I think it's got too much, you know, even though

1070
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:55,200
Rym: it's got, it's got lanes that like boundaries that are set by the source material that can make it very good in a narrow realm, but it will not have the opportunity to be as ridiculously like fuckery enabled experimentalism of adventure time.

1071
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,680
Scott: The Disney leash is going to prevent DuckTales from being as good as adventure time.

1072
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:03,596
Rym: But at the same time, it looks like it's going to be like, it's going to be as good as it can be.

1073
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,720
Rym: It is the best case scenario for a reboot of a Disney afternoon.

1074
00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:12,400
Rym: And my hope against hope is that this means we get a tail spin at some point.

1075
00:58:12,601 --> 00:58:19,419
Scott: If you like the DuckTales, the new one or the old one, go read actual duck comics, the old ones.

1076
00:58:19,681 --> 00:58:21,069
Scott: Yeah, but you want to get is you want?

1077
00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:22,919
Scott: we've done an episode on this super long ago.

1078
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:23,562
Rym: We did.

1079
00:58:23,602 --> 00:58:27,740
Scott: the life and times of Scrooge McDuck by Don Rosa is your starting point.

1080
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:37,600
Scott: And from there, if you are into it, you can read any duck comic, Scrooge or Donald or otherwise that is written by either Carl Barks or Don Rosa.

1081
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:38,865
Scott: Those are your two names.

1082
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:43,019
Scott: you're going to look for on the byline and read as much of that as you can get.

1083
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,999
Scott: A lot of it is in print and available if you spend money.

1084
00:58:47,602 --> 00:58:47,877
Rym: All right.

1085
