1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,630
Scott: I need something that's risk-free.

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,119
Rym: It's Tuesday, January 30th, 2018.

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:13,340
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:16,327
Rym: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,190
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

6
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:21,349
Rym: We're talking about the adorable Ratineer.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,153
Scott: Yar.

8
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:22,434
Rym: Yar.

9
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:22,877
Rym: Yar.

10
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:23,139
Rym: Yar.

11
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:23,804
Rym: Yar.

12
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:26,909
Scott: Let's do this.

13
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,479
Rym: It's been a while since we've done a Tuesday show, because we've been out of town and busy.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,979
Scott: It's been a while since we did any show.

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,879
Rym: Yeah, but Tuesdays are the easiest shows to do, because we actually do play a lot of games.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,019
Rym: Almost every convention we go to is a gaming con.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,039
Scott: Well, because you only do two shows a month of gaming, assuming we don't bail.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,739
Scott: And when you go to one convention, you're playing like ten board games.

19
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:55,060
Scott: So that's getting you five months, which definitely carries you to the next convention.

20
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,199
Scott: And that's just board games, not any other games.

21
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:02,319
Rym: All the non-GeekNights stuff we do, it's like 80% gaming right now.

22
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:04,440
Scott: It's also really easy to find gaming news.

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,620
Rym: Yeah, that is true.

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,859
Rym: And it's also really easy to make gaming news by just reviewing something briefly.

25
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:10,791
Rym: Anyway, we're back.

26
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:11,739
Rym: It's a Tuesday show.

27
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:18,800
Rym: If you saw us at MAGFest or PAX Unplugged, and you wondered why we were talking about anime or neckbeards or whatever, tonight's your night.

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,120
Rym: We're actually talking about games.

29
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,779
Rym: It's every other Tuesday we do this.

30
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:23,083
Scott: Yeah.

31
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,740
Rym: So right off the bat, we got some news.

32
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:31,920
Rym: If you might know, in fact, one of our more popular YouTube videos is us teaching a bunch of people how to play Tigris.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,858
Scott: Hey, you're stealing my news.

34
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:35,959
Rym: And Euphrates, I'm introducing your news, like the MC.

35
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:36,559
Scott: Okay, yeah.

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,460
Rym: Tigris and Euphrates is literally our favorite board game.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,160
Rym: And I don't say that lightly.

38
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:49,100
Scott: At Panguicon 2.0, in ancient times, there were many legendary things that occurred there.

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,240
Rym: We met Steve Jackson.

40
00:01:50,540 --> 00:02:03,079
Scott: One of the legendary things that happened was we went into a room of board games, which we discovered too late into the convention, and there were some employees from then-thriving Mayfair games, and they had this game, T&E, which I had vaguely heard of.

41
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,532
Rym: That they had just published in the U.S No, it had just published.

42
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:11,436
Rym: Remember, the tiles we were playing with were mixed in German and U.S.

43
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:13,499
Rym: tiles because they didn't have enough pieces.

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,231
Scott: The game had been in the U.S.

45
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:15,940
Scott: for a while.

46
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,940
Rym: But they had just done a printing of it, and it was a different-sized tile.

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,040
Rym: The

48
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,409
Scott: point was that I

49
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:21,818
Rym: had heard of this

50
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:26,272
Scott: game, and they taught us how to play, and we played, and we were like,

51
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:26,656
Scott: "Whoa."

52
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:36,619
Scott: And then we bought it, and then we proceeded to play it many, many, many, many times, and to this day, there are games that we play at a PAX, and before the PAX is over, we're done with it.

53
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:47,291
Scott: T&E, a game that we have played perhaps as long as most games that we played, tabletop-wise, and still play it, and we are not done with it.

54
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,879
Rym: Even three-player Puerto Rico ran out of plays, but T&E did not.

55
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,419
Rym: So, what's your news, Scott?

56
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:56,960
Rym: Why am I talking about Tigris and Euphrates?

57
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:58,348
Rym: Well, Dr.

58
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:02,037
Scott: K, Rainer Canizia, the creator of, not Puerto Rico, T&E.

59
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,755
Rym: I've never heard anyone call him Dr.

60
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:04,200
Rym: K before.

61
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:05,352
Scott: I've been calling him Dr.

62
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:05,940
Scott: K all the time.

63
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,940
Rym: I've never heard you do that, but I'm gonna also start doing that, 'cause I like that.

64
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,519
Scott: I decided to do it on my own.

65
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,140
Scott: I never heard anyone else do it, and I just kept doing it.

66
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,940
Scott: I don't know if that'll make him mad, but if it does, oh, well.

67
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:18,520
Rym: I'm gonna be your first follow.

68
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,620
Scott: Yeah, okay.

69
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,195
Scott: But anyway, so Rainer Canizia, also known as Dr.

70
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:27,580
Scott: K, and not the one who helps you kill yourself.

71
00:03:28,427 --> 00:03:29,057
Scott: Not that Dr.

72
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:29,118
Scott: K.

73
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:30,372
Rym: Not Dr.

74
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:30,599
Rym: Dre.

75
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:48,760
Scott: No, he is a man who has prolifically made a bunch of amazing board games, including T&E, and he has announced and put out the pictures and press release and the rule book for a as-yet unpublished game called Yellow and Yangtze.

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,700
Rym: You might recognize those as being the names of rivers.

77
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:59,560
Scott: In a different part of the world than the Tigris and the Afraidys, and basically this game is T&E with hexes instead of squares.

78
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,053
Rym: Oh, my God.

79
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:06,560
Scott: And also rules modifications to accommodate the hexes instead of squares.

80
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:17,139
Rym: I cannot stress to you how much the news that this is T&E with hexes matters to people like me, Scott, and our friend Pete, and our friend Alex.

81
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:27,560
Scott: Like, the fact that this would come out so many years after T&E, that would be like if Nintendo put out like, you know, well, I guess Nintendo does do that, the F-Zero, and then wait 20 years and then another F-Zero.

82
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:27,986
Scott: -Yeah.

83
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:28,535
Scott: -That's what this is.

84
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,440
Rym: But that doesn't happen with the things we care about usually.

85
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:33,740
Scott: No, but, yeah, well, we care about F-Zeros.

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,342
Scott: -Eh.

87
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:39,179
Scott: -Anyway, so, yeah, this is gonna get, like, insta-bought and played a zillion times.

88
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:45,998
Rym: So, what we're thinking about doing is T&E is a game that we, you know, we love it, we know it inside out, we're kind of obsessed with it.

89
00:04:46,861 --> 00:05:05,920
Rym: I'm really curious what it'll be like with hexes, because if you've played any game, it doesn't matter what kind of game it is, doesn't matter what the rules are in almost any capacity, changing between hexes, triangle grids, which you don't really use anymore, or squares, has profound impacts in ways that you might not realize.

90
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:11,139
Rym: I'm really curious what the game of T&E is like with hexes.

91
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:17,910
Rym: And I imagine that it is okay at minimum, because otherwise Dr.

92
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,379
Rym: K would not have done this to us.

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,046
Rym: Mm-hmm.

94
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:23,020
Rym: I wonder if it would work with triangles.

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,731
Scott: -You and your stupid triangles.

96
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:25,560
Rym: -I like the triangle grid.

97
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,280
Scott: For anyone who's not nerdy enough to realize, the hex map, it's like, why doesn't everyone use a square map?

98
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:40,260
Scott: Well, the reason the hex map is the best map for all gaming is because each space is equally distant from any other space.

99
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,720
Scott: You move to any adjacent space, and you are moving the same distance, right?

100
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:47,920
Scott: On a square map, if you move to say, you can only move four directions.

101
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,538
Scott: If you try to move diagonally, you're actually moving a different distance because of the Pythagorean theorem, right?

102
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:57,700
Scott: If you have a triangle map also, moving one space is not always the same unit of distance.

103
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:06,560
Scott: On a hex map, moving one adjacent space always moves you the same distance in space, and so all movements are equal.

104
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,979
Scott: On a hex map, a hex map is the perfect and best map for all games, which require movement of dudes around on the map.

105
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:16,576
Rym: However, hex maps have some-- Well, one, there's no movement in T&E.

106
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:22,220
Scott: That's what I didn't say, but just saying, for games that require movement, say Battletech--.

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,400
Rym: Also, you, by saying that it is the best way to deal with movement, you are really discounting the triangle grid.

108
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:31,860
Scott: Yeah, I am discounting your stupid triangle grid.

109
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,199
Rym: Triangle grids have a time and a place.

110
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:33,880
Scott: No, they don't.

111
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,139
Scott: You're just obsessed with triangle grids lately because you've realized that orthogonal and diagonal are part of them.

112
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,240
Scott: And that's how you do, is you get obsessed with a thing, and then that's a thing for you, regardless of merit.

113
00:06:44,260 --> 00:07:00,379
Rym: The problem with hexes is that the definition of diagonal is crazy, but more importantly, hexes mean that there are six things directly adjacent to any other thing, as opposed to squares, where if you're doing orthogonal adjacency, there's only four things.

114
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,940
Rym: That is a big deal for many things.

115
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,900
Rym: That is a big deal for Tiggers and Euphrates.

116
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,760
Scott: You know what we should do?

117
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:08,240
Rym: That changes everything.

118
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,139
Scott: You know what we should do, Rym?

119
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:09,739
Rym: What should we do?

120
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,999
Scott: We should just make hex carcass sound.

121
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:12,879
Rym: I don't think it would be good.

122
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:13,858
Scott: I want to play.

123
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,439
Rym: I don't think hex carcass sound would be good.

124
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,655
Scott: Surround that fucking, what's it called?

125
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,459
Scott: It's going to be way easier.

126
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:22,600
Rym: The cathedral?

127
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:23,780
Scott: Yeah, the whatever.

128
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,519
Scott: No, not the cathedral, the other one.

129
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:27,818
Rym: What other one?

130
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,579
Scott: The one where when it surrounds you take your guy off.

131
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:31,560
Rym: Anything?

132
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,920
Scott: No, the, you know.

133
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:34,640
Rym: The cloister?

134
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,660
Scott: Yeah, that one.

135
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,699
Rym: We just did a panel where we taught people this game.

136
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,900
Rym: The thing where you surround the thing.

137
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:44,700
Rym: Remember though, factory fun squares was great and hexes is apparently awful.

138
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,680
Scott: That's true.

139
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,340
Rym: Everyone said, I haven't played it, but everyone I know who has played the new factory fun with hexes has said that it is not fun.

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:52,916
Scott: I agree.

141
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:57,940
Rym: So I think what we might do is, this is an idea I had and people seem into it.

142
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,640
Rym: I feel like we should try to do a, we just did our judge anime by its cover again.

143
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,340
Rym: I kind of want to try to read the rules to this T and E version too.

144
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:05,840
Scott: They're up there.

145
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,097
Scott: Read them.

146
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,039
Scott: Their PDF is right there.

147
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:14,220
Rym: And then do a show where we try to review it before we play it and then review it after we play it and see how right we were.

148
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Rym: I really want to see if we are able to figure out how the game really is based on the rules alone and our deep knowledge of T and E.

149
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:32,340
Scott: Yeah, but that's not an objective thing because in your preview where you just read the rules, you could cement judgments in your mind and then hold firm in those beliefs regardless of what actually occurs during the game.

150
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:36,820
Rym: Is that one not an argument we could make for our judge anime by its cover?

151
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,157
Scott: I mean it happens to scientists doing real legit research too, so it's unavoidable.

152
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:51,900
Rym: But two, other people may play the game and then listen to both of our reviews and both notice the differences and be able to have an opinion on which of the reviews is more accurate to their experience.

153
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,060
Scott: Whatever.

154
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:54,610
Rym: We're the test subjects.

155
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:55,640
Rym: We're not the test doors.

156
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,480
Scott: The point is this game becoming is a big deal for us.

157
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,460
Scott: I don't know if it's a big deal for you, but I mean you're listening to GeekNights.

158
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:11,020
Rym: I feel like the first comment in the board game Geek Thread you linked me to is, "I really wonder how the T and E diehards will feel about this

159
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,100
Rym: one.".

160
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,920
Scott: Is that a GeekNights listener?

161
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:13,317
Rym: I assume so.

162
00:09:14,543 --> 00:09:14,989
Rym: It's Dr.

163
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:15,738
Rym: J over here.

164
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,226
Scott: One before Dr.

165
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,838
Scott: K. You got one up on him.

166
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,716
Rym: So in the other news...

167
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,077
Scott: He knows how to slam dunk Dr.

168
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:23,117
Scott: J.

169
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:30,280
Rym: I got a brief Geek Bite for you because I did finally just... The only reason I didn't own any VR up until now is that I didn't have time.

170
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:34,956
Scott: The only reason I didn't own any VR up until now is because it's a ginormous thing.

171
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:35,840
Scott: you got to slap to your head.

172
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,155
Rym: See, I don't know why it's not that enormous.

173
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:40,120
Rym: It actually works great.

174
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,760
Scott: I'm not down with the VR until it's like cool sunglasses or a jacket that goes into my neck or something like that.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,920
Rym: I don't think you'll ever experience VR in your life then.

176
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:48,807
Scott: I think we're good.

177
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:50,019
Scott: I think we will definitely make it.

178
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:51,367
Rym: We'll see.

179
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:52,680
Rym: Material science is a limitation.

180
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,139
Rym: But anyway, I would say having an Oculus and having fucked around with it a bunch now that I finally have time...

181
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,725
Scott: Material science is a limitation.

182
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:04,580
Scott: Let me show you telephones from earlier in my life compared to telephones now.

183
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,140
Rym: Yeah, telephones are still a physical thing I got to carry around.

184
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,080
Scott: They're way small.

185
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,631
Rym: They're not just in me.

186
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:10,700
Rym: Also, they're getting bigger.

187
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,760
Scott: They're not that small anymore.

188
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,660
Rym: They could be smaller.

189
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,519
Scott: They're getting worse.

190
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,180
Scott: We have the power to make them small.

191
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,438
Rym: But we choose not to.

192
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:19,859
Scott: They're still way smaller than a VR headset.

193
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:30,500
Rym: So I would say if you do not have a modern hot shit gaming PC, it is not worth it to get one just to get VR.

194
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,560
Rym: But if you already have a gaming PC that is capable...

195
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,698
Scott: And a bunch of extra money to burn and nothing better to do...

196
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:43,620
Rym: Then the extra money it takes to have full motion tracking VR, pretty minuscule compared to what you paid for that PC.

197
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:50,960
Rym: The whole Oculus thing costs less than a third of what a 1080 will cost you today thanks to the coin miners.

198
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:59,178
Rym: But what I want to geek by here is a game... Because a lot of people talk about what the must play games are if you get VR.

199
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,600
Scott: There's not too many of them, at least not yet.

200
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,400
Rym: There's probably 10 or fewer must play VR games right now.

201
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,700
Rym: The bomb defusing one.

202
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,180
Scott: Yeah.

203
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:11,179
Scott: The job simulating one.

204
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,279
Rym: Yeah, the Rick and Morty one is actually like...

205
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:14,760
Scott: I've heard good things about that one.

206
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,360
Rym: The Rick and Morty one is fantastic.

207
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,519
Rym: It might be the second best VR game there is.

208
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:20,740
Scott: The robot shooty one.

209
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,240
Rym: Robo Recall startled me to the point that I ran into the wall.

210
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,219
Rym: But I would say that the top of those is Superhot VR.

211
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:34,459
Scott: The bad guys only move when you move.

212
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,025
Rym: So Superhot is an FPS.

213
00:11:36,065 --> 00:11:40,900
Rym: where the shtick is, nothing moves except when you're moving.

214
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:43,080
Scott: So if you stop moving, the game is paused.

215
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,280
Scott: Right.

216
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:51,480
Scott: So if you play this game, basically you just take your mouse, hands off the keyboard and mouse and you look around and you think, all right, I got to kill that guy next.

217
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:53,120
Scott: How am I going to move?

218
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,359
Scott: And you move real carefully and then headshot him.

219
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:59,658
Scott: But meanwhile, as you're doing that, all the other bad guys are coming or perhaps even shooting.

220
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,720
Scott: And he's like, well, I see a bullet coming at me.

221
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:02,700
Scott: I got to move this way.

222
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,800
Scott: And it's almost like a real time, a turn based game.

223
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:11,760
Scott: But you sort of control the clock, but it only goes forward.

224
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:14,320
Scott: And it's a really, really good concept.

225
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,039
Rym: It's a really good concept and it's really fun.

226
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,688
Rym: But Superhot VR is not just.

227
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:24,540
Rym: we made a VR version of Superhot because the reality is very few games can just be turned into a VR version of the game.

228
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,179
Rym: And games that try, people who try to do this tend to make really bad experiences.

229
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,900
Scott: Well, any FPS is much easier to do because it's FP because pretty much VR has to be FP.

230
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,559
Rym: Yeah, you'd think that.

231
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:39,500
Rym: But there's a lot of surprising problems that make that not feasible.

232
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:43,680
Scott: I'm saying you want to make games in VR first person.

233
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,140
Scott: We really would have a third person view.

234
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,200
Rym: Actually, some of the must play games are these third person games.

235
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,719
Rym: They work great.

236
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,499
Scott: What, like Mario?

237
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,820
Rym: Like Lucky's Tale or whatever.

238
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:52,636
Rym: How does that work?

239
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,719
Rym: Just third person.

240
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:57,080
Rym: You just got to see it, like play it.

241
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,219
Rym: And you're like, oh, I get it.

242
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,680
Rym: And it's hard to explain the experience.

243
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,119
Scott: But anyway, are you poking Lucky in the ass to make a move?

244
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,340
Scott: You're actually not lucky.

245
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:07,780
Rym: Poking him in the ass is probably a yet another game.

246
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,980
Rym: Because one thing I will say, poking around the indie VR experiences.

247
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:12,598
Scott: Lots of porn?

248
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:13,780
Rym: Not really.

249
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,658
Rym: They're not porn.

250
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:16,159
Scott: Porn adjacent?

251
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:17,680
Rym: They are porn adjacent.

252
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,940
Rym: They are porn for certain people and not porn for other people.

253
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,099
Rym: They are like a wife who comes and like stands next to you the game.

254
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,520
Rym: But Super Odd VR is its own experience.

255
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,980
Rym: And to geek bite it, having played it, it is a peak gaming experience.

256
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,635
Rym: Everything everyone has said about it is 100% accurate.

257
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,699
Rym: This game, it's really short.

258
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,539
Rym: It's a very curated experience.

259
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,479
Rym: You can beat the whole thing in under an hour.

260
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:47,052
Rym: It is the best experience I have had in VR.

261
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:49,120
Rym: hands down, bar none, no exceptions.

262
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,999
Rym: And it is an amazing game.

263
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:55,920
Rym: I'm not saying that if you don't want VR, that you should buy VR to play this game.

264
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,160
Rym: But if you have a VR headset, you're doing yourself a grave disservice not playing this game.

265
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:02,260
Rym: It is intense.

266
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,399
Rym: And the deal is, it's just like the concept we talked about.

267
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:09,120
Rym: Everything is frozen and as you move, the game moves.

268
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,780
Rym: Turning your head counts as movement.

269
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,817
Rym: So you're basically Neo in the Matrix like you shoot a guy in the face with a shotgun.

270
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:28,120
Rym: You drop it and you slowly raise your hand up and catch the gun that he dropped out of the air and turn around in bullet time dodging bullets and shoot another guy in the face.

271
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:39,839
Rym: It's also a very high concept because it starts you in a room and in the game you put on a VR helmet and play super hot and then you take the VR helmet off and do other stuff.

272
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:47,839
Rym: It's just abstract and beautiful and crazy and it is the example of what to strive for in making a VR game.

273
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,459
Rym: I cannot stress enough how fantastic this game is.

274
00:14:51,840 --> 00:15:00,960
Rym: My only warning to you is that it is quite intense and the scariest thing that will ever happen is just someone knocking on a door.

275
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:03,571
Rym: So what do you got?

276
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:04,199
Rym: You got anything else?

277
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,238
Rym: Other than the fact that we were at PAX.

278
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,680
Scott: I had my news which is that there's a new game coming out.

279
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,277
Scott: And MagFest.

280
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,239
Scott: You didn't even have a news.

281
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,480
Rym: That was my news, the Geek Bite.

282
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,039
Scott: I thought you said there's so much gaming news.

283
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
Rym: There is and I didn't want to waste all our time talking about all this gaming news.

284
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,180
Rym: We could talk about how the Overwatch League has had already two separate instances of high profile sexism.

285
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,960
Scott: Yeah, it's got problems.

286
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,840
Rym: And also the fact that I watch the games and I enjoy them.

287
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,365
Scott: I only watch New York vs.

288
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:32,998
Scott: Philly and it's like even as someone who's never played Overwatch, it's like, "Oh, alright, it's

289
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:33,319
Scott: okay.".

290
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:36,840
Rym: But I literally do not care who wins any game.

291
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,660
Scott: Yeah, it's like I wanted to root for New York but it's like there's no connection between that team and New York whatsoever.

292
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:52,180
Rym: The New York team has so little tie to New York that if you change the names of all the teams, so they were officially from different cities, I don't think anyone would notice.

293
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,419
Scott: They don't play in New York.

294
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,240
Rym: They don't play in New York.

295
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,519
Rym: They're not from New York.

296
00:15:57,343 --> 00:16:02,098
Scott: I mean, their name is Excelsior which is New York-ish because of the New York State motto.

297
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,100
Rym: There's only two kinds of people who recognize that word.

298
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,320
Rym: People who care a lot about New York State and comics fans.

299
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,438
Scott: People who like Stan Lee.

300
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,420
Rym: Yeah, no one else even thinks about that word and that word means nothing to them.

301
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,115
Scott: Yeah, it's like, "Uh,

302
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:17,520
Scott: alright.".

303
00:16:17,702 --> 00:16:19,079
Scott: The logo doesn't even look good.

304
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,240
Scott: It doesn't make me want to buy their merch.

305
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,220
Rym: The token effort of having like a physical place somewhere in New York doesn't even have to be a good place.

306
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,440
Scott: I'm pretty sure all these games are played at the Blizzard Arena in LA.

307
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,460
Rym: They need a place in New York where they sell tickets for people to physically sit and watch the game on a screen.

308
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:35,639
Scott: They do at the LA.

309
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:36,855
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

310
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:38,600
Scott: At the Blizzard Arena.

311
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:43,279
Rym: The teams are just so interchangeable that I can't care about them.

312
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,340
Rym: Despite being a crazy fan of both Overwatch competitively and playing Overwatch.

313
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,359
Scott: They came so close.

314
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:54,919
Scott: And the other thing is that Overwatch is such a fast game to watch.

315
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,211
Scott: And they keep the camera work.

316
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,960
Scott: They keep switching between characters.

317
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:01,160
Rym: They don't do it well.

318
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:02,406
Scott: Constantly.

319
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:04,400
Scott: It's not the greatest spectator experience.

320
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,068
Scott: I feel like they should just use a zoom.

321
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,140
Scott: They should never use the first person view ever.

322
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:12,940
Scott: You don't have a first person view when you're watching NFL.

323
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,653
Scott: Just give me the all 22 the whole time.

324
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,037
Rym: You know what I would do actually?

325
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,981
Scott: I guess in this case the all 10.

326
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:25,300
Rym: If I were the production manager for esports like Overwatch.

327
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,635
Rym: I would always make sure that there are two different feeds for every game.

328
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:30,700
Rym: that's our real game.

329
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,200
Rym: There'd be the normal spectator view that has a certain kind of commentary.

330
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,820
Rym: And it's that high level never first person zoomed out curated view.

331
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,288
Rym: And then I'd have a separate stream.

332
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:46,000
Rym: that is are you a serious Overwatch player?

333
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:46,859
Rym: Here's your crazy bullshit.

334
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,840
Rym: Here's the zoomed in view that you want.

335
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,560
Scott: I don't know why we don't have more like a user control of the cameras during esports.

336
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,980
Scott: Because if you look at say Hearthstone.

337
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,940
Scott: When you watch Hearthstone on Twitch everyone's using these plugins now.

338
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,637
Scott: All the streamers.

339
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,920
Scott: And the plugins allow you to like move your mouse over the deck to see how many cards are left.

340
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,760
Scott: Or hover your mouse over a card to see what the text is.

341
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:10,620
Rym: Dude old FPS tournaments in the old as days before modern esports.

342
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,760
Rym: The spectator mode was you join a game like a tournament.

343
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:14,699
Rym: They still have that.

344
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,960
Rym: Yeah but you join it as a spectator and that was the primary way you'd watch.

345
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,240
Rym: You just move around and watch whatever you wanted to watch.

346
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,046
Rym: So there's actually.

347
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,559
Scott: this is gonna be my other news.

348
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,089
Scott: But I guess we got.

349
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:25,020
Scott: we got to it right.

350
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:26,640
Scott: So this crazy thing happened.

351
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:30,539
Scott: Where the I forget is it Dota I think.

352
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,179
Scott: Or was it Dota or was it LoL?

353
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,820
Scott: I forget but basically.

354
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,480
Rym: Doesn't matter.

355
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,367
Scott: I think it's.

356
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:36,978
Scott: I think it's Dota.

357
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,400
Scott: And the oh right I know what it is.

358
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,300
Scott: Okay so ESL the European esports right group right.

359
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:47,892
Scott: They made an exclusive agreement to stream on facebook.

360
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:48,454
Scott: only right.

361
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,400
Scott: So the official ESL dota championship was streamed on facebook.

362
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,220
Scott: And if you were to restream that on twitch they would shut you down for copyright infringement.

363
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,660
Scott: Because you're like restreaming this you know broadcast that you don't have expressed written consent.

364
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,660
Rym: You had only implied oral consent.

365
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,680
Scott: You had no consent whatsoever.

366
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:10,879
Scott: Right well you know what some people did.

367
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,980
Scott: What some people did is they used dota TV which is sort of like half-life TV.

368
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,740
Scott: They basically spectated the pros in dota on their computer.

369
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,249
Scott: And broadcasted that on twitch with their own commentary and their own camera.

370
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:25,670
Scott: work right.

371
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,880
Scott: Basically it'd be like if I was at the NFL game with my own camera making my own TV channel.

372
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:35,367
Scott: According to valve.

373
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,960
Scott: that is a-okay you can totally do that.

374
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,445
Scott: And that doesn't violate.

375
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:41,556
Scott: you know the only one who can stop you from doing.

376
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:42,300
Scott: that is valve.

377
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,740
Scott: But ESL was trying to shut people down on twitch for doing that.

378
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,940
Scott: They weren't rebroadcasting ESL stuff.

379
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,240
Scott: And valve and ESL are now butting the heads and this is really awesome.

380
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,740
Rym: Now my opinion and fascinating.

381
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:59,040
Rym: ESL independent of any like what the actual legal arguments will be.

382
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:03,420
Rym: Is making a big goddamn mistake by trying to do this kind of nonsense.

383
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,420
Rym: That is not the way to monetize your esports.

384
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,640
Rym: Because you cannot treat that aspect of it like traditional sports.

385
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,220
Rym: Because there is no culture in watching baseball of recreating the baseball games and then streaming that.

386
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,720
Scott: I think another thing is that you know you look at TV sports right.

387
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,880
Scott: If you sign an exclusive TV agreement for a sport.

388
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,277
Scott: So now your favorite team is on this channel instead of that channel.

389
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:27,840
Scott: right.

390
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:30,420
Scott: The only real difference is the announcers.

391
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,220
Scott: And it's like oh you lost the announcer you liked and now you got a shitty one.

392
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,480
Scott: Or maybe you get a better one.

393
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,720
Scott: That's the only real difference right.

394
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,280
Scott: You don't care if your football game is on CBS or Fox that much.

395
00:20:39,801 --> 00:20:41,079
Scott: Because they're all shitty announcers.

396
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:42,368
Rym: Except for like two right.

397
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,280
Rym: There is not a culture in those sports of doing streaming.

398
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,020
Rym: Esports right.

399
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,040
Scott: No but what I said but here in esports right.

400
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,960
Scott: Facebook watching on Facebook is very different than watching on YouTube.

401
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,719
Scott: They're very different than watching on Twitch.

402
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:58,760
Scott: The actual channel it's on matters a lot.

403
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,700
Scott: So when Facebook wants to get some gaming content on their streaming site.

404
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,680
Scott: So they make these deals and they pay ESL to bring the games exclusively to Facebook right.

405
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,320
Scott: That's basically like well this games on a shitty channel that's worthless to watch on.

406
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,160
Scott: And now people are gonna watch these other people instead.

407
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,240
Scott: Who are broadcasting their own broadcast competing with the official one.

408
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,120
Rym: I just I wonder who makes these kinds of decisions like do they not.

409
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,980
Scott: Facebook paid ESL a bunch of money and ESL said wow we could really use that bunch of money.

410
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,159
Scott: Okay sure we don't give a fuck.

411
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:33,477
Rym: But no one involved on either side thought for a minute of wait.

412
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:34,099
Rym: is this gonna work?

413
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,015
Scott: I mean ESL I think probably realized but I mean like.

414
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:38,638
Scott: well it'll stream.

415
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:39,060
Scott: who cares.

416
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,340
Scott: And Facebook I guess you know has so much money and they're stupid.

417
00:21:43,662 --> 00:21:48,440
Rym: Yeah I feel like companies like Facebook are going to vastly mishandle this.

418
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,798
Rym: In a way that.

419
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,800
Scott: They already mishandled.

420
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,920
Rym: Yeah I feel like they're gonna continue to mishandle it.

421
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:57,420
Scott: But yeah this is a fascinating story here and there's more to come in this arena.

422
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,538
Scott: I'm watching it closely.

423
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,240
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

424
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,340
Rym: What do you got?

425
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,511
Scott: What did I have?

426
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:09,940
Scott: I forget.

427
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,298
Rym: Getting Over It?

428
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,280
Scott: Yeah so this is a game called Getting Over It.

429
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,699
Rym: Which I literally had never heard of.

430
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,280
Scott: Raymond never heard of this even though it's a big deal and everyone's raving about it lately.

431
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:19,580
Scott: Anyway so.

432
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:20,859
Rym: I just never encountered it.

433
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,580
Scott: You may have if you haven't if you don't know exactly what I'm talking about already.

434
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:31,820
Scott: You may have seen a game where there is a man or some sort of human inside of a cauldron with their torso sticking out.

435
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,740
Scott: And they have a sledgehammer and they wield this sledgehammer to climb.

436
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:39,999
Scott: And they basically poke the sledgehammer down to push themselves up.

437
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:42,180
Scott: Swing it around to grab onto things.

438
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:45,340
Rym: It's quap crossed with mount your friends.

439
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:46,660
Scott: That's basically what it is.

440
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,599
Scott: It's climbing quap.

441
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,480
Scott: It has real as the controls are as awful as you think they are by looking at it right.

442
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,800
Scott: And you can get used to it though if you played a bunch.

443
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:56,200
Scott: And this game has been all the rage lately.

444
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,280
Scott: There have been a lot of videos of it.

445
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:00,160
Scott: The game has a few jump scares.

446
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,920
Scott: So there was some great video going around of people getting freaked out by the jump scares.

447
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,890
Scott: And then falling all the way down.

448
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,040
Scott: So yeah it's a pretty good game.

449
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,553
Scott: I'm not playing it because I feel like watching the video.

450
00:23:11,593 --> 00:23:12,760
Scott: I got all I need to get out of it.

451
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:13,999
Scott: And it's not worth my time.

452
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:15,660
Scott: But I still applaud this game.

453
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,139
Scott: Good job.

454
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,980
Scott: Nice design.

455
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,340
Scott: Nice.

456
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,159
Scott: You know very clever.

457
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,200
Scott: Very funny.

458
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:19,918
Scott: You know.

459
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,777
Scott: Good job you.

460
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:28,040
Scott: Anyway here is my thing of the day which is somebody getting the world record time for beating this game.

461
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,759
Scott: Which is basically like a few minutes.

462
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,440
Scott: And you can see the whole game really really quick.

463
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,320
Scott: This person is like a master.

464
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,380
Scott: They practiced so much.

465
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:36,940
Scott: Oh my God.

466
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,820
Scott: And then they uninstalled the game right after they got this world record.

467
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:43,099
Scott: And I'm pretty sure it is still the world record for beating this game.

468
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:44,199
Scott: Good job.

469
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,297
Scott: I clap for you.

470
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:45,999
Rym: That is amazing.

471
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:46,817
Rym: Yeah.

472
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:53,679
Scott: So yeah if you somehow are like Rym and have been living under a rock and haven't seen the game called Getting Over It.

473
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:55,034
Scott: Here you go.

474
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,279
Rym: I don't know how I missed this.

475
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:57,880
Rym: It's just my social media feed.

476
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,198
Scott: I imagine most of you have seen it.

477
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,180
Rym: And somehow in my social media feed literally no one has mentioned this game.

478
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,039
Scott: It's been around for a while.

479
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:04,540
Rym: Oh yeah.

480
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,040
Rym: It just never came up in my social media.

481
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:06,498
Rym: Alright.

482
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,760
Rym: So when I was a kid at Cedar Point.

483
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:10,699
Rym: There was a roller coaster that I rode.

484
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,339
Rym: And it was called Avalanche Run.

485
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:14,017
Scott: Okay.

486
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,717
Rym: Didn't have rails.

487
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:17,860
Rym: It was like a toboggan run.

488
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:18,760
Scott: Like half pipes.

489
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:19,806
Rym: No.

490
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,600
Scott: So like a bobsled but instead of ice just wood?

491
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,540
Rym: Basically yeah it was a roller coaster bobsled.

492
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:25,949
Scott: How did the friction?

493
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:27,480
Scott: not like just start a fire or something?

494
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:28,700
Rym: I mean it worked fine.

495
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:31,180
Scott: Was it like a fiberglass tube or something?

496
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,720
Rym: Yeah this video will actually get into detail on all that.

497
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,559
Scott: I imagine the friction would like wear away the thing you're sitting in right?

498
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,165
Scott: Like one of the two surfaces.

499
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:42,120
Scott: either the track or the thing you're in the vehicle are gonna like erode right?

500
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,160
Rym: That would end up being fine.

501
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,160
Scott: Scratching against each other?

502
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:44,740
Rym: But anyway.

503
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:48,579
Rym: The ride was not popular because it actually just wasn't that good.

504
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,876
Scott: I imagine that would not be a smooth ride.

505
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,960
Rym: No it was smooth.

506
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,440
Rym: It just wasn't that scary or fun.

507
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:55,380
Rym: Like it was a pretty sweet milk toast roller coaster.

508
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,620
Scott: Maybe that's why the friction didn't start fires.

509
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:58,323
Rym: So.

510
00:24:59,447 --> 00:24:59,698
Rym: They.

511
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,220
Rym: This coincided.

512
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,460
Rym: When they decided this roller coaster wasn't actually that popular or doing that well.

513
00:25:06,002 --> 00:25:07,200
Rym: With Star Tours.

514
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:08,739
Scott: In Disney.

515
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,660
Scott: Oh the one where.

516
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,480
Scott: I've done Star Tours.

517
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,772
Scott: Star Tours is a Star Wars ride.

518
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,299
Scott: It used to be the only Star Wars ride in Disney.

519
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,959
Scott: But now they're building a Star Wars land around it I guess.

520
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:19,180
Rym: I'm pretty sure Star Tours is gone.

521
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:19,876
Scott: Is it?

522
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:21,999
Rym: I'm pretty sure it was gone a long time ago.

523
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,660
Scott: Oh I've ridden it many times.

524
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,579
Scott: Oh yeah as a kid.

525
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,360
Rym: I probably rode it like eight times in a row.

526
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,740
Scott: You go and you sit in what appears to be a Star Wars vehicle.

527
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:31,880
Scott: They close the door and there's a screen in the front.

528
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,060
Scott: Yes Scott it closed eight years ago.

529
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,177
Scott: Okay.

530
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:37,800
Scott: I've ridden it many times thankfully.

531
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,220
Scott: Yeah.

532
00:25:38,782 --> 00:25:46,466
Scott: And you get a video of C3P and R2D2 doing something and the thing moves around but it doesn't move forward or back.

533
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:49,522
Scott: it just sort of moves in place and makes you feel like you're moving.

534
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:55,560
Scott: and they have improved on that not moving ride technology much since the time of Star Tours.

535
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,800
Rym: Oh the newest Harry Potter equivalent of that is pretty fucking crazy.

536
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:06,580
Scott: Even the Spiderman one I went on in the late 90s early 2000s or whatever that one was is way way way beyond Star Tours.

537
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:11,560
Scott: Star Tours and it's like back to the future ride level of you know action.

538
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,723
Rym: This video is basically a really deep dive into what Cedar Point did with that roller coaster?

539
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:27,440
Rym: because what they did I mentioned this on GeekNights a long time ago they built a building around the roller coaster and they made it a themed Star Tours like experience.

540
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,280
Scott: With no Star Wars.

541
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,571
Rym: With a Disney style lot.

542
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:30,379
Rym: yeah no Star Wars.

543
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,086
Scott: Did they use Snoopy?

544
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,180
Scott: because it's a Snoopy park.

545
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:33,707
Rym: It wasn't Snoopy park.

546
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:36,300
Rym: then it became Snoopy park relatively recently.

547
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:37,066
Scott: I thought it is.

548
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:38,419
Scott: I thought it's no longer Snoopy Park.

549
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:40,420
Rym: Well but before that it wasn't anything.

550
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,680
Rym: They had a Berenstain Bearsland like in the middle for kids but there was no licensed.

551
00:26:46,284 --> 00:26:48,160
Rym: there was no license to anything at Cedar Point.

552
00:26:49,300 --> 00:27:00,179
Rym: So this video is a pretty well researched deep dive into the whole story of why Cedar Point did this what this ride was like and it sort of has this implied story of.

553
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:05,319
Rym: there's not a lot of footage or photographs of this or a lot of similar things from this era.

554
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:11,679
Rym: It is amazing how much information from the late 70s through the early 90s is just fucking gone.

555
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:18,565
Rym: And this video like does the best it can to get all the information that's possible to describe.

556
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:20,613
Scott: you think information for that era is gone.

557
00:27:20,653 --> 00:27:22,779
Scott: if you go back in time it's even more is gone.

558
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,900
Scott: As you go back in time more information is gone.

559
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,920
Scott: Until recently where we've had ridiculous recording and storage technologies.

560
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:31,160
Scott: Even now think about how much is gone.

561
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,440
Scott: We can't even keep fucking websites from Geocities around.

562
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,894
Rym: But like the only reason we actually know like what it like.

563
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:45,099
Rym: we can see today what it looks like inside this ride is because some rando carried a camcorder in there once and we got a hold of that footage.

564
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:59,216
Rym: So this video is just really interesting about the history of this one roller coaster in detail and like why it was made the way it was and how Cedar Point decided to try to copy Disneyland and have an experience as opposed to a thrill ride.

565
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:03,160
Rym: and then they realized fuck that and they never did that again and now they make just crazy thrill rides.

566
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:07,720
Rym: It's also interesting because you might have seen me complaining on Twitter about this.

567
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:20,237
Rym: The only complaint I have is this is another one of those videos that is really good except the person who does the narration is a fragile child who has modulated their voice because they don't like what their voice sounds like when they hear it.

568
00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:24,460
Rym: And that bothers me to the point that is very hard to watch videos that have that.

569
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,655
Scott: You know just my initial guess though is that you know Cedar Point.

570
00:28:27,695 --> 00:28:36,700
Scott: the employees who make the rides are engineers largely and thus they would fail to make an experience whereas Disney Imagineers actually extremely creative people.

571
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:42,078
Rym: So actually the engineers the experience they made was actually really high production values.

572
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:44,580
Scott: Well just that doesn't mean it's creatively good.

573
00:28:45,382 --> 00:28:53,553
Scott: You could give me a ton of money to make a movie and it will say this video answered a question that was burning in my mind for decades.

574
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:59,065
Rym: because when you got when I got off this ride because when Cedar Point got a new roller coaster it was a big deal as a kid.

575
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:07,659
Rym: So when you got off this ride this attendant would be there and they'd be like welcome to Alaska and I didn't know what the fuck they meant.

576
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:14,900
Rym: And now someone validated that that wasn't just something I made up that that did happen and why it happened.

577
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,969
Rym: They had two different stories around this roller coaster and they never actually linked them up.

578
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,739
Rym: So it's just interesting this whole thing.

579
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:33,600
Rym: In the moment the book club book which will I'll be updating the website will be reading soon is Emily Wilson's translation new translation of the Odyssey by Homer.

580
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:35,120
Scott: Yeah not dancing home.

581
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:35,639
Scott: I'm at home.

582
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,558
Scott: Just regular home.

583
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,357
Scott: Stabbing Homer.

584
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,083
Rym: Yeah.

585
00:29:39,341 --> 00:29:40,967
Rym: Well he does stab that Cyclops in the eye.

586
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,658
Scott: so Homer isn't the one who stabs.

587
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:52,880
Rym: Well if Homer wrote it then I ostensibly if you take the Princess Tutu look Homer did stab that Cyclops in the eye by way of a character that he created.

588
00:29:53,569 --> 00:29:54,339
Rym: But I digress.

589
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,100
Rym: We were at Pac South.

590
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,378
Rym: We were at Mag Fest.

591
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,940
Rym: We have video from both those conventions on a YouTube channel and much more to come.

592
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,719
Rym: We also Scott just uploaded like today.

593
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:14,700
Scott: It's a little bit late because it's like there's already like three or four episodes in the current anime season but we didn't see any of them at the time of this recording.

594
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,620
Scott: So we still judged the winter 2018 anime season by its cover.

595
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:22,592
Scott: And I mean all this if you know.

596
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:24,198
Scott: I think it's in time right.

597
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,339
Scott: The spring one will be more on time.

598
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:27,340
Rym: Yep.

599
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:39,440
Rym: And more you need to subscribe to Scott's YouTube channel because this video is good and we're doing this as a series but they're on Scott's channel because he makes the videos and I mean I can't upload them to your channel.

600
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,009
Scott: Yeah.

601
00:30:40,404 --> 00:30:41,040
Scott: It's your channel.

602
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,039
Scott: I can't log into it.

603
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,720
Scott: I need your Google account.

604
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:50,080
Rym: And we are way too far down the road of having our own channels to make like a new branded channel that will have no subscribers.

605
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:59,000
Scott: There is a GeekNights channel and we sort of I think I can still log into it but it's it's problematic because we made it in an ancient era of YouTube and Google.

606
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,777
Scott: I mean the real goal is to like if we're ever making enough video to where it matters.

607
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:08,420
Scott: we would just like you know like YouTube would talk to us right.

608
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:08,760
Scott: Yeah.

609
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,698
Scott: Make us an accommodation.

610
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,560
Scott: And if it's not at that point then who gives a shit really.

611
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,719
Rym: But anyway if you if you feel like you're missing out on some GeekNights talks and videos.

612
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:21,460
Scott: You can always go to front row crew dot com where all of our content is forever.

613
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,324
Rym: Except this one.

614
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:24,859
Rym: because we go to front row crew dot com it's still the balancing game design.

615
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,659
Scott: No I put they put the thing on.

616
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,180
Rym: I think you set the date behind the date of balance and game design.

617
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,396
Scott: Did I?

618
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,239
Rym: Balance and game design shows up in the front page.

619
00:31:33,422 --> 00:31:33,713
Scott: I don't know.

620
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,858
Scott: Go check it right now.

621
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,440
Rym: No.

622
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:42,540
Rym: So yeah otherwise we got no conventions until PAX East.

623
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:42,925
Scott: Good.

624
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,159
Rym: We can finally relax and actually do GeekNights again.

625
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,035
Rym: So follow us and all our stuff and stay tuned.

626
00:31:49,336 --> 00:31:56,600
Rym: the next video I'm going to upload is the top 40 tabletop games you need to play for magfest which was actually a pretty good panel.

627
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:04,740
Rym: So we played a game that Chris and Anthony brought and it's another one of these like indie Japanese tabletop games.

628
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,480
Scott: We played at magfest and PAX out.

629
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:13,537
Scott: And it was made by the same person who made what the Yokohama and which we didn't like and what other games.

630
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,799
Scott: It's Sashi Hayashi.

631
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,870
Rym: Let's see.

632
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:17,939
Scott: Yeah Yokohama.

633
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,279
Scott: We played a few games by this person.

634
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:21,600
Rym: Yep.

635
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,919
Rym: Yokohama is the one that I remember.

636
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,399
Scott: There was also some emperor one or something that I sucked at.

637
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:26,917
Rym: No no no here we go.

638
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:27,860
Rym: Emperor's Choice.

639
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,479
Scott: That one.

640
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:29,238
Scott: I sucked at that.

641
00:32:29,903 --> 00:32:31,260
Rym: I liked Emperor's Choice.

642
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,440
Rym: It has some problems but I enjoyed it.

643
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,179
Scott: Was Emperor's Choice the one I was good at?

644
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:35,839
Scott: I forget.

645
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,936
Scott: Well the one where the scoring cards flipped over.

646
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:39,359
Scott: is that it?

647
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:40,718
Rym: Or is it the one?

648
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,800
Rym: That is Emperor's Choice.

649
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:43,339
Scott: Okay that's the one I sucked at.

650
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,460
Scott: The one where you place your worker and you could occupy two spots.

651
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,140
Rym: That is the game you'll never forget.

652
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:52,960
Rym: Your year with the dragon.

653
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,279
Scott: Is that made by the same person also?

654
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,444
Scott: No.

655
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,053
Scott: Okay.

656
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:56,080
Scott: Anyway.

657
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:57,879
Rym: This is the Emperor's Choice person.

658
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:12,650
Scott: Anyway so yeah this game is called Ratineer and when we saw the game at least I was immediately attracted to it because as the name implies it is a combination of rats, squeak squeak, eating pizza, and also buccaneers, yarr.

659
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:17,460
Scott: we are pirates, let us be cute pirate rats, pirates who are cute.

660
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,140
Scott: I don't know why they didn't translate it to pirat but Ratineer is okay.

661
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:25,980
Scott: Yeah it's a game where you are pirate rats trying to out pirate the other pirate rats.

662
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,860
Rym: So it's not a great game?

663
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,000
Rym: It's not in the class of like Tiggers and Euphrates.

664
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,058
Scott: I mean the theme though.

665
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,695
Scott: The theme.

666
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,619
Rym: The theme's good.

667
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:32,887
Rym: Yeah.

668
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:38,358
Rym: And the game is relatively unique in that there are few games that use a mechanic like this.

669
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,159
Scott: I cannot, there are not many games that you can compare this game to mechanically.

670
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:42,219
Scott: no.

671
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,829
Rym: The game, but the game has a lot of the elements, like.

672
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,697
Rym: I feel like a game that was meteor.

673
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:51,400
Rym: that did some of the things this game does would be very much up my alley.

674
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:52,920
Rym: But this game is good.

675
00:33:52,980 --> 00:34:00,620
Rym: It's a good game to bust out at a convention because it generates a lot of moments where everyone goes oh shit really and something crazy happens.

676
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,339
Scott: So first of all the game is really cute.

677
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:05,540
Scott: I was immediately attracted to these pieces in the game.

678
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,739
Scott: One of which had a tiny cute rat and a little red and white floaty rat.

679
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:12,018
Rym: There are only two images of this game on BoardGameGeek.

680
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:12,570
Scott: Yeah.

681
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,329
Scott: Which is the cutest little rat I've ever seen?

682
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,357
Scott: and then I was told that that is the rat king of the sea.

683
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,739
Rym: The rat king of the land is pretty good though.

684
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,717
Scott: The rat king of the land is also cute but not as cute as the rat king of the sea with the red and white floaty.

685
00:34:26,904 --> 00:34:27,859
Rym: The floaty is what does it.

686
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,739
Scott: Yeah I'm all about the rat king of the sea.

687
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,679
Scott: I almost thought about making that a Twitter avatar.

688
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,228
Rym: So the theme is your rat pirates.

689
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:35,400
Rym: whatever but the gist of the game.

690
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,511
Scott: The main mechanic.

691
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:37,120
Rym: that matters.

692
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,320
Rym: You do a blind bid for where you're gonna go on this chain of islands.

693
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:46,378
Scott: Everyone's got two pirates and you never get more and you could get some deckhands but whatever.

694
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:56,880
Scott: You basically secretly allocate to, there's a chain of islands from the land out to the treasure island in a straight line and you allocate secretly where you're gonna send your pirates and your deckhands.

695
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,598
Rym: You'd be like I'll send a pirate to island one and island three.

696
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:07,120
Scott: Yeah I'll send a pirate to the magical treasure island and a pirate to this middle island and a deckhand on the land and so forth.

697
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,479
Rym: And the islands all have goods that you're gonna do some stuff with.

698
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,540
Scott: All the islands do stuff.

699
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,359
Rym: Well the islands all have goods on them.

700
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:15,120
Rym: The treasure island has crazy bullshit on it.

701
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:25,100
Scott: Everyone reveals and then simultaneously sends out their pirates and deckhands to the thing but starting at the land where I guess the tavern is right where the money is.

702
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,160
Rym: You do the thing on the first place then the second place then the third place.

703
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,320
Scott: And as soon as you reach a spot in the chain, it's just a straight line where there nobody sent anybody.

704
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,340
Scott: No one sent a pirate.

705
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,400
Scott: No one sent a deckhand.

706
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,120
Scott: No one sent anything to that spot.

707
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:40,900
Scott: All of the islands further out in the chain.

708
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,340
Scott: Everyone just gets swept away to the beach and doesn't get to do that stuff.

709
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,620
Scott: So it's really hard to do the treasure island because to do the treasure island you need to have something on every single other spot.

710
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,440
Scott: Something to keep that chain alive so that I guess you can get home safely with a treasure.

711
00:35:56,901 --> 00:36:04,280
Rym: Now also this leads to those situations where every round especially later in the game people are thinking did anyone go on space one?

712
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,018
Rym: Please I hope someone went on space one.

713
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,676
Scott: There are a lot of times where no one goes on space one and everyone gets washed away to the beach.

714
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,375
Rym: Yup.

715
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:11,872
Scott: The end.

716
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,460
Rym: Now the rest of the game is pretty simple mechanically like it's not even that exciting.

717
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,440
Scott: Each of the different islands does something.

718
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,000
Scott: The first space just gives you money.

719
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,620
Scott: The second space lets you buy helping cards and more deckhands.

720
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:32,778
Scott: All the other normal spaces are all the same and they have cards that line up next to them that have goods and the goods become victory points and then at the very end of the treasure island.

721
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,359
Scott: And I think there's another one that lets you flip victory points and then the beach.

722
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:38,019
Scott: Yup.

723
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,313
Scott: Whatever.

724
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,620
Rym: The game is only of sort of moderate actual depth in terms of strategy.

725
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:56,565
Scott: The main mechanic that's fun and interesting and that you care about is the one I just described where you want to send your guys deep but if you do they might just get washed away to the beach and sort of risk and also looking at what other players are going to do.

726
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:57,960
Scott: And if you fill in stuff.

727
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,520
Scott: But try to guess what they're going to do and then you know.

728
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:04,879
Rym: If you fill in stuff to go deep you're giving other people potentially a stepping stone to go deeper.

729
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,357
Scott: Right.

730
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,762
Scott: And if you look at some spaces in the middle and it's like well that's a really good spot to go.

731
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:14,260
Scott: but if I go there, Rym also goes there, he's going to, I'm going to get less stuff.

732
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:18,080
Scott: but wait if I don't go there, Rym's going to go there alone and take all the stuff.

733
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:29,919
Rym: So here's where this has another level of that same sort of like guessing what the other people are going to do and anticipating and risk taking is that all the islands where you get stuff, if you're there by yourself you get all the stuff.

734
00:37:30,462 --> 00:37:33,560
Rym: If you're there with other people you take turns based on some rules and who gets stuff.

735
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,400
Scott: You're basically looting cargo ships.

736
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,400
Rym: But if one of those islands has fights on it, you gotta win the fight.

737
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,100
Scott: Otherwise everyone dies and goes to the beach.

738
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,573
Rym: And when you win the fight, if you win the fight, the dudes you use to fight the fight generally die.

739
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,100
Rym: So ideally.

740
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:49,899
Scott: Unless you have cards.

741
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:54,880
Rym: But all the people on that island share the fight and the results together.

742
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,900
Scott: So if you get someone else to fight, you can get treasures by joining in.

743
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,639
Scott: So there's multiple levels of- But if you go there and then no one else goes to fight there, you could just die.

744
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,879
Rym: Multiple levels of anticipating what other people might do and planning on that and risk taking based on that.

745
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:17,040
Rym: Now in terms of strategy, the trouble with the game is that really the only thing, like the strategy is pretty simple.

746
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:28,340
Rym: You play conservatively when you're ahead in the sense that you play easy plays early in the board and you don't ever give people opportunities to go deeper.

747
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,200
Rym: Because why would you?

748
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,436
Rym: If you're already ahead and there's a turn where no one gets to do anything, you stay ahead.

749
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:44,958
Rym: And if you're losing, you take increasingly desperate risky strategies to try to go deeper, to try to get a big payoff because you're hoping that nobody went on the place with three fights and you get all the goods.

750
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:50,460
Rym: And that's really the only strategy involved.

751
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,960
Scott: I mean, but that's the interesting part, right?

752
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:54,540
Scott: What other game does that?

753
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:01,686
Scott: Most of the risk reward games are games of like pushing, like, you know, no thanks where it gets deeper and deeper and deeper and you take it.

754
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:10,680
Scott: or infiltration where you go deeper and deeper and deeper than turn back or deep sea adventure where you go deeper and turn back.

755
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,540
Scott: In this game, every single turn, it's like, how deep is it safe to go?

756
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,858
Scott: Every single turn, you're making a brand new judgment and you're getting severely punished for going too deep.

757
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,800
Rym: Is the splendor of that kind of game.

758
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,657
Rym: But then you can try again.

759
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:28,540
Rym: Actually, Antdecker has that to a big degree.

760
00:39:28,621 --> 00:39:28,937
Scott: A little bit.

761
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,500
Rym: Antdecker, when you're exploring, that's the how much are you going to risk?

762
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,659
Rym: What's the risk reward ratio?

763
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:39,136
Rym: But most of these games, the risk taking is independent of anticipating what other players will do.

764
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,339
Rym: Like in infiltration, it's obvious what other players will do because the game's actually infiltration.

765
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,800
Scott: I don't have as much freedom.

766
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,638
Rym: I have an increasingly dour opinion of because the game always plays out the same way and you have very little agency.

767
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:56,179
Rym: It takes too long for what you get out of it.

768
00:39:56,362 --> 00:39:56,758
Scott: That's true.

769
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,502
Rym: And there is.

770
00:39:58,124 --> 00:40:03,080
Rym: it is almost never viable to go even halfway into that stupid place.

771
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,339
Scott: You need some luck to get deep.

772
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,719
Rym: You need a lot of luck to go deep.

773
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:08,438
Scott: Unlike Deep Sea Adventure, where you can get the big treasures reliably.

774
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:18,039
Rym: Retinaire is a pretty good balance of these mechanics and you get to have that go deeper not anticipate other players over and over and over again.

775
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,620
Rym: My only complaint and I'm not going to complain that the game's a little random with the cards because it is, but that's not bad.

776
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,220
Rym: That's fine for this level of game.

777
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,695
Rym: My only complaint is the game takes about 10 to 15 minutes longer than it feels like it should.

778
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:38,098
Scott: My complaint with the luck actually in this game is that you have the land seat rat king and the water rat king, right?

779
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,100
Scott: The cutest pieces and they rotate around the board fairly.

780
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,160
Scott: So everyone gets a roughly even number of times as both.

781
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:52,977
Scott: And basically what those do is they allow you to either have priority on the land spaces or priority on the water space, which gives you more context to decide what other players are going to do.

782
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,522
Rym: So when

783
00:40:53,542 --> 00:41:01,580
Scott: you are the sea rat king, you want to play your guys out in the water and you will get first dibs even if someone goes to the same space you go to, but everyone

784
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,365
Rym: knows you're going to do

785
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:05,279
Scott: that obviously, but I mean you just do it anyway because you still get first dibs.

786
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,179
Scott: What they can do about it, right?

787
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:08,580
Scott: And then if you go land, you're the land rat king.

788
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:13,729
Scott: You also get first dibs, you can get more money or more cards or whatever before other people.

789
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:17,019
Scott: And so they rotate evenly and it's kind of fair.

790
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:25,980
Scott: But the thing is there's a lot of situations where, for example, I was the sea rat king once and no one went on the one space, just coincidence that time.

791
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:30,660
Scott: And I had a good play and I just, Oh, I got, I got burned.

792
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:33,905
Scott: And that's, you're only going to get to be the sea rat king, like two or three times GG.

793
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,279
Scott: I basically lost right there.

794
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,379
Rym: Why'd you take that risk?

795
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,440
Scott: I didn't, you know, how was I, why would I go on the land space when I'm the sea rat king?

796
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,560
Rym: You put one deck hand there as insurance.

797
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:50,120
Rym: I just, but I'm just saying it's like, you know, you know, this risk reward, this game, you literally can spend actions, which are the primary economy in the games.

798
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:50,857
Rym: You don't get many.

799
00:41:51,184 --> 00:41:51,416
Scott: Yep.

800
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,039
Rym: To buy insurance.

801
00:41:53,348 --> 00:41:53,518
Scott: Yep.

802
00:41:53,620 --> 00:42:02,578
Scott: By putting a deck hand somewhere to ensure, you know, it's just the thing that can happen, It could be not even getting a big, not as that's, that's an example of really big, bad luck.

803
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,160
Scott: I'm talking about a little bad luck.

804
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:09,000
Scott: Like, Oh, I was the sea rat king and there really weren't any good islands to go to.

805
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,499
Scott: Like there weren't a lot of cards out there to pick up on when I happened to be the sea rat king because of the way the turns went.

806
00:42:14,881 --> 00:42:18,360
Scott: And then I, so I, you know, I did what the best I could and whatever.

807
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:23,699
Scott: And then I passed the sea rat king to the left and suddenly all these amazing diamonds get dealt out.

808
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:30,519
Scott: And now the person to the left of me is the sea rat king and they get all these victory points by going to this awesome island.

809
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,800
Scott: And because I was just the sea rat king, I have more, I have like no priority on water.

810
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:36,699
Scott: I've heard on land.

811
00:42:37,082 --> 00:42:39,259
Scott: I can't get those victory points just because luck.

812
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:39,858
Rym: Yep.

813
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,900
Rym: I mean, that's why I said, I'm not saying this is bad.

814
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:45,059
Scott: Board games have luck.

815
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:45,758
Scott: That's the thing.

816
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,620
Rym: But that's why I'm saying the game needs to be like 15 minutes shorter.

817
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,857
Scott: It doesn't ruin the game.

818
00:42:50,183 --> 00:42:51,118
Scott: It's just, it's a thing.

819
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:55,579
Rym: If the game were shorter, that would be less of a concern because you just play it again.

820
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,580
Rym: Uh, the other funny thing as Demoisell just pointed out in the chat, it's not localized so well.

821
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:03,640
Scott: Well, yeah.

822
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,439
Scott: There's some really funny things like, so this money art is in.

823
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:06,810
Scott: Yes.

824
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:07,458
Scott: There's a cut.

825
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:11,540
Scott: There's, there's cards for the special rats that you can buy on the land at the tavern.

826
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,140
Rym: A few of them are basically like translated wrong.

827
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,299
Rym: So like the surgeon is the thief.

828
00:43:16,848 --> 00:43:17,080
Scott: Yeah.

829
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:18,760
Scott: They wrote the wrong words on them.

830
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:27,999
Scott: But the, the, uh, the best one, the bogus money artisan, the counterfeiter who gives you like a money every turn, basically, uh, something like that.

831
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,660
Scott: But instead of saying counterfeiter, it says bogus money artisan, which is amazing.

832
00:43:33,241 --> 00:43:41,260
Rym: I will at any point in my life where there is an opportunity to say the word counterfeit, I'm going to say bogus something, say bogus money and say bogus money artisan.

833
00:43:41,428 --> 00:43:41,560
Rym: Yeah.

834
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:42,160
Rym: But it could be bogus.

835
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,239
Rym: I mean, we're gonna do a GeekNights episode in the future.

836
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,728
Rym: Are you a bogus MP3 artisan?

837
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:49,637
Scott: Is that what you are?

838
00:43:50,680 --> 00:44:00,419
Rym: But I would say that if you are the kind of person who whips out games for people like you're the kind of person who brings a game to your group and says, Hey, let's play this game.

839
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,218
Rym: It's cool.

840
00:44:01,944 --> 00:44:02,920
Rym: This is a game to have.

841
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,760
Rym: This is a game that a lot of people you bring games for have not played before.

842
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,899
Scott: Also it's, people haven't played this.

843
00:44:09,401 --> 00:44:13,540
Scott: It has cute rats that can bring people in as a cute pirate theme that you can get into.

844
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:14,340
Scott: It's pretty cool.

845
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,080
Scott: Even though it has some problems, you can still get enjoyment out of it multiple times.

846
00:44:19,044 --> 00:44:19,858
Scott: It's easy to learn.

847
00:44:20,381 --> 00:44:24,780
Scott: It's quick to learn, even though it's too long for what it is, it's still not long to play overall.

848
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,156
Rym: Yup.

849
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:26,720
Scott: Uh, and it's unique.

850
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,140
Scott: It's not like other games.

851
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,760
Scott: You have this unique mechanic that make it worth playing.

852
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,520
Scott: There isn't like some replacement game that's like, Oh, you shouldn't play right near play this instead.

853
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:39,200
Scott: It's like, there isn't really a game that I've seen that has that chain connection mechanic.

854
00:44:39,523 --> 00:44:40,460
Scott: That's really interesting.

855
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:51,080
Scott: Uh, I almost sort of feel like it's a furry and it's obviously nothing like for you of Dracula, except free of free of Dracula has the Dracula's hidden movement mechanic.

856
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,900
Scott: that is amazing.

857
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:53,560
Scott: That is unlike any other game.

858
00:44:53,620 --> 00:45:00,780
Scott: And the rest of the game is may rat near has the chain simultaneous placement mechanic, which is unique and unlike any other game.

859
00:45:00,861 --> 00:45:02,058
Scott: And the rest of the game is a game.

860
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:09,199
Rym: If we could make the, make the combat and fury of Dracula act somehow like this blind bed system in right near.

861
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,300
Scott: So basically take two unique systems and combine them.

862
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:11,998
Scott: And that's the whole game.

863
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,360
Scott: Two really interesting, unique systems together.

864
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:15,518
Rym: I feel like that could work.

865
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,357
Scott: Go for it.

866
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,580
Rym: That goes against most of the advice we give people for designing games.

867
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:25,078
Scott: But yeah, it's a, you know, definitely, I think, you know, there was so much attention on the Euro games.

868
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:30,577
Scott: I'm glad we have some friends who pay attention to the, uh, Japanese produced board games out there.

869
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,620
Rym: I haven't been, I do not have time to pay attention to that right now.

870
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:42,300
Scott: And I'm sure there are other countries besides Japan and European union that are produced and United States that are producing quite excellent tabletop games.

871
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,954
Scott: And I would like to see some of those, please translate them and deliver them to us for the win.

872
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,640
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

873
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,359
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

874
00:46:00,741 --> 00:46:05,800
Scott: Be sure to visit our website@frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

875
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:13,460
Rym: remember GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, sci-tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

878
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:40,470
Rym: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night and the Patriot on Patriots for this episode of GeekNights are including someone who got robbed from their, uh, name reading due to a checkbox in Patriot.

879
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:45,768
Rym: Um, Craig Oliver, Alan Joyce, Rebecca Dunn, Heidi McNichol, a shimmering group, the obelisk hanging in the sky.

Rym: Cause he, four to one creations.

882
00:46:55,453 --> 00:46:56,990
Rym: No, I never ever wonder why we're here.

883
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:57,870
Rym: Semper fi bitch.

884
00:46:58,173 --> 00:46:58,790
Rym: Shervin, not horrible.

885
00:46:58,890 --> 00:46:59,248
Rym: Real of Val.

886
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,670
Rym: James David White, Rochelle, Monta, super boy room says something funny here.

887
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,248

890
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,170
Rym: I've been talking about Cedar point a lot lately cause I'm going there this summer.

891
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,668
Rym: And once I decide when I'm going, I will tell all of you when I'm going to be there in case you happen to be there.

892
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:29,110
Rym: But anyway, now I leave you with something that has nothing to do with Cedar point.

893
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:32,829
Scott: you don't belong to them.

894
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:40,810
Rym: They left me in a world of darkness without your sexy hands.

895
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:42,381
Scott: And I miss you.

896
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:43,108
Scott: night, man.

897
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:13,800
Rym: We have defeated the evil that was here naturally.

898
00:48:14,281 --> 00:48:29,040
Rym: For I am the day, man, the night man, the master of karate and friendship for everyone.

899
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:29,700
Rym: Hey man.
