1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,808
Scott: It's Thursday October 14th.

2
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:11,511
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,872 --> 00:00:12,253
Scott: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:13,979
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,922
Scott: Tonight, burgle, burgle.

6
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:22,590
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,554 --> 00:00:28,318
Scott: So, uh, how's that headache going?

8
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:29,179
Rym: Headache's gone.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,841
Rym: I'm actually feeling pretty good now.

10
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:33,644
Rym: In fact, I feel fantastic.

11
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:39,912
Rym: Are you gonna, um... I actually feel fantastic.

12
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:42,641
Rym: I'm at the 96 hour mark.

13
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:47,237
Scott: Are you going to, uh, return or are you gonna, you know, stick with it?

14
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:50,392
Rym: Well, I'm going to continue to consume caffeine on a regular basis.

15
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:51,556
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

16
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,890
Rym: I very much enjoy caffeine and coffee and tea and everything.

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,144
Scott: I just drink the decaffeinated varieties.

18
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:00,188
Scott: It can't taste any different.

19
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,152
Rym: It tastes way different.

20
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:02,217
Scott: How does it taste different?

21
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:04,186
Rym: Because of the processes they use to make it.

22
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:07,258
Scott: Well, I mean, is the caffeine naturally in the cocoa beans?

23
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:07,660
Scott: Yes.

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,125
Scott: The ultra-rare cocoa beans.

25
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:13,287
Scott: Okay, so it's not, so they do have to do something to get it out of there.

26
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:14,495
Rym: Yes, they have to chemically remove it.

27
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:16,044
Scott: Is there, you know what we could invent?

28
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:26,071
Scott: We should invent a chemical that like bonds to caffeine and turns into something else so that you can like take a pill then drink coffee and it tastes like non-decaffeinated coffee, but it doesn't actually happen.

29
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:30,712
Rym: If I sell you this Hale and Hardy bean counter carb, you can get 10 ultra-rare cocoa beans.

30
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:32,396
Scott: Are you serious?

31
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,945
Scott: Buy 10 soups and get a free soup.

32
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:39,839
Scott: Yeah, I've got a. buy 10 burgers, get a free burger from the burger truck.

33
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:40,562
Scott: So far I've got two.

34
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:43,578
Rym: Oh man, I wish Good Burger had something like that.

35
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:44,827
Rym: I'd get a burger like every two weeks.

36
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:48,627
Scott: The thing is the truck only comes around like once a week, which is probably good.

37
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:50,155
Scott: Otherwise I'd have a burger every day and be fat.

38
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:52,368
Rym: But a lot of people, I posted in the forum.

39
00:01:52,388 --> 00:01:53,594
Scott: They got this potato onion rolls.

40
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:58,236
Rym: Have an email in me and posting in the forum ever since I said I'm temporarily giving up caffeine.

41
00:01:58,296 --> 00:01:59,764
Scott: I guess that's, it must be a hot item.

42
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:01,533
Scott: That's why we're talking about it again.

43
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:03,464
Rym: I got a lot of Twitter responses and everything.

44
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:06,455
Rym: And the biggest question was, Whoa, you actually did research.

45
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:07,980
Rym: Is caffeine hurting me?

46
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:09,966
Scott: Probably.

47
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,751
Scott: Yeah, actually now everything hurts you.

48
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:14,017
Scott: Water is hurting you in every way.

49
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:15,742
Scott: The air oxygen hurts you.

50
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:25,397
Scott: However, once you start consuming more than 300 milligrams of caffeine a day for an average body, you know, that's like 2000 calorie diet.

51
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:30,057
Rym: I mean, if you're a six year old girl, you probably shouldn't be having 300 milligrams of caffeine a day.

52
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:34,974
Rym: Chocolate bars probably too much, but teaspoon full of sugars and trouble.

53
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:46,454
Rym: But if you consume that much, you know, more than way too much regularly within about two weeks to develop physical dependence, 48 hours after you stop crippling headache.

54
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:51,152
Scott: So, I mean, physical dependence just means that your body will hurt you if you stop.

55
00:02:51,172 --> 00:03:01,990
Rym: So it means that your body has increased the amount of adenosine receptors, which will slow you the fuck down because it makes adenosine more effective on you.

56
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,976
Rym: It slows you the fuck down.

57
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:14,982
Rym: So when you stop taking caffeine, now you've got, you know, everything else is low again and any little amount of adenosine, which normally would just make you a normal amount of tired, just knocks you out.

58
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:15,927
Rym: You're just done.

59
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:17,233
Rym: You can't even think straight.

60
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:20,066
Rym: Of course, you can cure that by drinking more caffeine.

61
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:20,849
Scott: Yeah.

62
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:25,674
Scott: Well, let us cure this caffeine like bonds of the adenosine receptors and prevent adenosine from doing its magic.

63
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:33,285
Rym: It's an adenosine antagonist, as far as I can tell, which as a result causes the body to upregulate and make more adenosine receptors to counteract the effects.

64
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,454
Scott: I thought you said it.

65
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:36,760
Rym: There is a mystery.

66
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,769
Rym: Well, this is why you can build up tolerance.

67
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:42,186
Rym: If you keep using caffeine too much regularly, then you build up this tolerance.

68
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,873
Rym: But there's something called the wall.

69
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:56,216
Rym: Once you get to a certain level of tiredness and you have already developed full caffeine tolerance, no amount of increased dosage will have any effect because there's no adenosine left.

70
00:03:56,376 --> 00:04:05,389
Rym: No, they don't know why, because if it were just the adenosine receptors alone, then increasing the dosage of caffeine should cause the effects to resume.

71
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:08,303
Scott: It's like you only have a certain number of them total, right?

72
00:04:08,403 --> 00:04:09,328
Rym: No, you get more of them.

73
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:10,533
Scott: You can have infinity of them?

74
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:14,230
Rym: Well, I guess you can have, I don't know, one per neuron or receptor.

75
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,711
Rym: I don't know.

76
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:15,996
Scott: I'm not a biologist.

77
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:20,171
Rym: You've already extended all of my biology knowledge out of me.

78
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:20,973
Rym: I don't know anymore.

79
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:28,955
Rym: But suffice it to say, I'm glad that I'm past the 48 hour mark and I'm feeling good.

80
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:34,735
Rym: My goal was to get until the end of the day, Friday, and then it's Red Bull time.

81
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:44,227
Rym: Because one thing I haven't experienced in many months is the effects of caffeine on a non tolerance, built up body, which as I recall, is awesome.

82
00:04:44,549 --> 00:05:01,143
Scott: Alrighty, so you know how we used to, you know, we know you, you and I know that the Sudafedrine is like the only medicine that will actually help you if you have a congestive cold nasal something something as a connoisseur of nasal problems.

83
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:04,397
Scott: I mean, like fucking regular old cough syrup just doesn't do shit.

84
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,696
Scott: In fact, scientifically, it really it doesn't do shit except make your throat feel good.

85
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:13,885
Rym: Scott can vouch for the fact that I have quite a bit of experience with nasal problems, blockages, mucus.

86
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:15,833
Scott: I don't know why you just don't like drill a hole in your nose.

87
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:16,677
Scott: That'll open it right up.

88
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:18,404
Rym: I got a hole.

89
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,167
Rym: I got two holes.

90
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,005
Scott: Yeah, but they could use a drill to make them bigger and then you would be all foot.

91
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:23,251
Scott: Everything would flow freely.

92
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:31,078
Rym: Regardless, Sudafedrine is one of the most effective decongestants in the world, and it has very few side effects.

93
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:31,480
Scott: It is.

94
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,445
Scott: It makes you a little tired.

95
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:34,414
Rym: It's the may or it makes you pumped up.

96
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:36,080
Rym: Yeah, depends on the person.

97
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:38,229
Rym: But regardless, it's an awesome drug.

98
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,032
Rym: It's like aspirin.

99
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:40,237
Rym: It's one of those bad ass.

100
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:40,961
Rym: Let's go.

101
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,046
Rym: Let's cure everything drugs.

102
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:52,482
Scott: It just so happens, though, that by a very dangerous chemical process, it is possible to use Sudafedrine as a key ingredient in the manufacture of crystal meth.

103
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:53,969
Rym: It's actually not that dangerous.

104
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,057
Rym: It's only dangerous, but if they don't know how to.

105
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:59,732
Scott: I mean, it's more dangerous than distilling like Vodac.

106
00:05:59,772 --> 00:05:59,953
Scott: Right.

107
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:00,897
Scott: Which could explode.

108
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,242
Scott: You know, this is more.

109
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:03,568
Scott: this is more dangerous than that.

110
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:04,712
Scott: So true.

111
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,863
Scott: It's not as dangerous as, say, cesium and water.

112
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:11,980
Rym: I would argue that they're actually similarly dangerous if you know what you're doing.

113
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,792
Rym: But the thing is, point the first, you know what you're doing.

114
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:18,125
Rym: People who do meth moves not the smartest point.

115
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:22,483
Rym: The second, if you're smart enough to know good lab practices, you probably don't need to make math.

116
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:23,065
Scott: I know.

117
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:23,266
Scott: Right.

118
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,799
Scott: But anyway, so the thing is in the

119
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,060
Scott: U.S.,

120
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,565
Scott: they passed a law some years ago where if you want to get any drug that actually has the Sudafedrine in it, you have to get it over.

121
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:36,961
Scott: You have to, you know, sign a paper at the drugstore and write your name down and all this.

122
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:40,014
Rym: And at least in New York, I have to present my I.D.

123
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:47,320
Rym: and they scan it and they consult with the computer to see how much Sudafedrine I have bought in the last month and the last year.

124
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,091
Scott: And in fact, what ends up happening is bought too much.

125
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,600
Rym: I legally cannot buy more Sudafedrine.

126
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:56,093
Rym: And in fact, if Scott, if you bought some for me, that is a federal crime.

127
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:56,654
Scott: Oh, shit.

128
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:57,115
Scott: Oh, well.

129
00:06:57,857 --> 00:07:03,913
Scott: But anyway, the the thing is, is that most people don't even realize this.

130
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:04,093
Scott: Right.

131
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:06,321
Scott: Because they just see, oh, it's Mucinex.

132
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:07,465
Scott: Oh, it's Sudafed.

133
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:07,846
Scott: Right.

134
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:11,699
Scott: And they have different letters like Mucinex D, Mucinex E.

135
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:16,718
Rym: Even worse, the people who buy Sudafed brand Sudafed, which doesn't even have Sudafedrine in it anymore.

136
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,246
Rym: At least the stuff on the counter.

137
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:18,788
Rym: It's fake.

138
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,351
Scott: In fact, the stuff on the shelf, the stuff behind the counter, behind the glass case is the good stuff.

139
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:24,437
Rym: I read many articles.

140
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:35,221
Rym: I don't want to try to find them again, basically pointing out that the drug they found to replace Sudafedrine, that is legal and not regulated because you can't make meth out of it, doesn't work any better than a placebo.

141
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:35,924
Rym: It's bullshit.

142
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:42,605
Rym: And also, apparently, the company that made that drug was a huge lobbyist for anti-meth legislation.

143
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,829
Scott: So there we go.

144
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,531
Scott: There you go.

145
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:51,793
Scott: But anyway, so CVS, right, one of the biggest chain drugstores in the United States, perhaps the biggest.

146
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,344
Rym: And I used to go to Perry drugs when I was a kid.

147
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:54,464
Scott: Yeah.

148
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:56,391
Scott: Apparently they didn't.

149
00:07:57,094 --> 00:08:04,176
Scott: they didn't properly apply this law in the years of 2007 and 2008, as well as the other drugstores did so.

150
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:15,392
Scott: And they lost a case in court and they now have to pay seventy eight close to seventy eight million dollars to the government for failing to, you know, properly not sell people Sudafed.

151
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,580
Scott: And apparently they're responsible.

152
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:23,901
Scott: They're being held responsible for the spread of crystal meth in California and somewhere else.

153
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,706
Rym: Are you fucking kidding me?

154
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:26,589
Scott: The attorney, U.S.

155
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,914
Scott: attorney in L.A.

156
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:34,158
Scott: is basically like, hey, crystal meth spread all over Vegas and Southern California because they didn't follow the law properly.

157
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:34,239
Scott: Huh?

158
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:38,895
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't quite add up more like I can't I'm.

159
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:43,251
Scott: I'm like, you know, our police aren't doing a very good job of stopping the crystal meth.

160
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:45,221
Scott: Let's blame it on the drugstore and get a bunch of money.

161
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:45,884
Scott: Wow.

162
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:49,200
Scott: That's more money than like all the parking tickets we've got all year.

163
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,632
Rym: I'll tell you what would stop crystal meth right quick.

164
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:52,977
Rym: Legalize weed.

165
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:53,700
Rym: I don't know.

166
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,185
Scott: It would maybe, but maybe not.

167
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:58,842
Rym: Not that many people are doing meth because they want to do meth.

168
00:08:58,862 --> 00:09:00,310
Rym: They're doing meth because that's what they can get.

169
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,831
Rym: Yeah.

170
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:09,196
Scott: But I mean, do you think some of those people are doing meth because, you know, but the now they're both illegal.

171
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:15,622
Rym: You would be surprised outside of cities and areas where there's a bunch of hippies or nerds living or like college kids.

172
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:18,232
Rym: It's actually really hard to get weed and really easy.

173
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:21,886
Scott: But they're talking about Southern California and Las Vegas.

174
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:23,753
Scott: Those are easy places to get weed.

175
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:25,699
Scott: Depends on among the easiest.

176
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:28,890
Scott: If you don't, California is the number one easiest.

177
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,388
Rym: If you're not on the end and Vegas has fucking everything, you don't have a dealer.

178
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:33,131
Rym: It's not that easy.

179
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:35,542
Scott: OK, anyway, but you can.

180
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:38,996
Scott: but you're going to manufacture meth, but you're not going to grow weed plant in the very least.

181
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:44,904
Rym: I think teenagers who are doing meth would probably have moved to weed instead if we were legal and meth were still illegal.

182
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,016
Scott: They probably never would have started the meth in the first place.

183
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,650
Scott: The thing is, if you're already on the meth, you're already on.

184
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,595
Rym: You're already fucked.

185
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:50,796
Scott: Yeah.

186
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,063
Scott: It's you're not going to switch.

187
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:52,707
Scott: It's just now.

188
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:54,979
Rym: I thought you were going to bring up a much scarier story.

189
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:00,623
Rym: I forget what state this was in, but a woman bought a bunch of Sudafedrin in like February because her husband was sick.

190
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:08,595
Rym: And then like way later in the year, she was at some other drugstore and she bought some more Sudafed unrelatedly for some other illness that someone had.

191
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:11,850
Rym: And she technically went over the limit, but the store didn't notice.

192
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,733
Rym: She got arrested.

193
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:13,416
Scott: Wow.

194
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:13,858
Scott: Yeah.

195
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:14,742
Rym: She didn't realize it.

196
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:15,887
Rym: She didn't even know it was a law.

197
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:17,374
Rym: The store didn't realize it.

198
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:18,178
Rym: They sold it to her.

199
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:19,143
Rym: They're not in trouble.

200
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:19,827
Rym: She's in trouble.

201
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:23,707
Rym: And in fact, the law says it's the duty of the people buying it to make sure they don't break the law.

202
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:24,269
Scott: Wow.

203
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,293
Scott: It's just bullshit.

204
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:30,067
Scott: I just, we need to start some underground Sudafedrin.

205
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,579
Rym: See, we always talk about how the war on drugs is so mismanaged.

206
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,272
Scott: We'll end up in federal prison and we're not even doing crystal meth.

207
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:39,347
Scott: What do you think the judge would say if it was shown in court?

208
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:41,317
Scott: Yes, we had nothing, we don't care about crystal meth.

209
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:44,053
Scott: We were literally just trying to get cold medicine that actually works.

210
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,903
Rym: That's basically what the woman who was arrested did.

211
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,130
Rym: And that defense didn't fly.

212
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:47,952
Rym: Really?

213
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:49,055
Rym: Because the law's the law.

214
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:51,263
Scott: God damn.

215
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,812
Scott: This is why we, you know, at least in Britain, I mean, it's good.

216
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,167
Scott: It's a double edged sword of letting the judges use common sense, right?

217
00:10:57,328 --> 00:10:58,434
Rym: I think there's a way around that.

218
00:10:58,454 --> 00:10:59,822
Scott: because you got a common sense judge.

219
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,631
Scott: You'd be like, well, the law says this, but you know what?

220
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:02,294
Scott: I don't agree with that.

221
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:03,921
Rym: So I think a better way.

222
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:11,673
Rym: What if every law had to have a short, like you had a limit, you already, you said this before a thousand times, limit X word statement of intent.

223
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:17,438
Rym: And it's pretty much a viable defense to say, yeah, I broke the law, but the intent does not cover what I did.

224
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:18,785
Rym: And then the judge would have to sort that out.

225
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,272
Rym: Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

226
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:23,426
Scott: This intent of this law is to stop this flow of crystal meth.

227
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:25,194
Scott: Well, I had nothing to do with crystal meth.

228
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:27,404
Scott: So even though I broke that law, that doesn't apply to me.

229
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:27,846
Rym: Yep.

230
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:34,393
Rym: Anyway, however, all that aside, we always talk about how the drug war is so mismanaged in such a disaster in America.

231
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,794
Scott: And yet Mo, usually when we say that people think maybe that's the dagger nature we need is the drug war.

232
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:40,883
Rym: I think that is one of the dagger nations we need.

233
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:41,205
Rym: Yeah.

234
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:59,836
Rym: But people think, oh yeah, because we lock up all these nonviolent offenders and you know, that whole side of it, but there's this whole other side of it of not only denying a perfectly usable drug, like pseudo federal and the people who really need it like me, but just the whole mismanagement of the situation regarding people on meth.

235
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:02,990
Rym: I mean, none of the policies seem to actually prevent the spread of meth.

236
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,211
Scott: I know Japan is even more strict, right, than the US, but even like allergy medicines, it's hard to get.

237
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:12,752
Rym: Japan has a weird bug up their butt about any sort of stimulant, unless it's tobacco or caffeine.

238
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:14,058
Scott: Yeah, they love those.

239
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,072
Scott: You can do them anywhere in the store, in the restaurant, you know, whatever.

240
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:26,163
Scott: But I wonder if, you know, there's all similar pseudo-veteran regulations in other countries, you know, like, can I go to France and just get pseudo fed?

241
00:12:26,243 --> 00:12:26,845
Scott: That's for real.

242
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:27,768
Scott: No problem.

243
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:28,631
Rym: I don't know.

244
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:29,354
Scott: I hope so.

245
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:29,877
Rym: I really don't.

246
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:30,560
Scott: Probably.

247
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,884
Rym: I would guess you could, but on a completely unrelated topic, this is something that came up when I was a kid.

248
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:43,311
Rym: You know, I was in middle school and the local mall was like, we're banning anyone under 18 on the weekends, unless they're with their parents.

249
00:12:43,854 --> 00:12:46,687
Scott: That never happened to me, the mall near my house, but maybe it is now.

250
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:47,049
Scott: I don't know.

251
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,556
Rym: Well, it happened near me when I was a kid.

252
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:53,076
Scott: It's not a new trend, but in the last few years, I remember the mall in Poughkeepsie was like that.

253
00:12:53,277 --> 00:12:53,478
Rym: Yep.

254
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,736
Rym: Now even the, that big mall in Brooklyn is like that, but there, that mall is crazy.

255
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:00,461
Rym: You gotta be 21.

256
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:00,782
Scott: What?

257
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:01,464
Rym: Yep.

258
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:02,025
Scott: Whoa.

259
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,730
Scott: That can't be, how was that legal?

260
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,654
Rym: It's perfectly legal.

261
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:05,800
Scott: I mean, if you're 18, you're an adult.

262
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,179
Scott: So if you, if you're, if that was age discrimination, you could file a lawsuit.

263
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,346
Rym: They totally get away with it.

264
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:14,806
Rym: It's been that way for a while, but they're basically in the last few years, malls across the country.

265
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:20,926
Rym: I just have one article about it, have been jumping over themselves to ban teenagers from the mall.

266
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:29,116
Rym: If they can all the time or in the very least at night and on a weekends or when they're unaccompanied, this is only unaccompanied teenagers, right?

267
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:30,583
Scott: If I go with my mom, it's okay.

268
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:32,250
Rym: Well, every mall is different.

269
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:41,428
Rym: I don't know of any malls that just banned teenagers outright, but that one in Brooklyn bends, any group of more than X people, it's a small number that are under 21.

270
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:44,181
Rym: If anyone in the party is under 21, unless their parents are with them.

271
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:48,721
Scott: Well, what if there is like one person like me, I could just, can I walk in with all the kids?

272
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,805
Rym: No, cause you're not their parent.

273
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:51,271
Scott: I have to be the parent.

274
00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:55,348
Rym: That's how a lot of movie theaters will say like, Oh yeah, you're the cool 18 year old kid.

275
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,454
Scott: What if they don't have any parents?

276
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:57,359
Scott: They have foster parents.

277
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,013
Rym: Well, they're fucked because this is a really sad situation.

278
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:01,980
Rym: It's the Atlantic terminal mall in Brooklyn.

279
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:02,723
Rym: Okay.

280
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:07,459
Rym: Groups of five or more shoppers who are under 21 are forced to disperse and or leave.

281
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,201
Rym: Alrighty.

282
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:18,776
Rym: But what amazes me is that all the malls and all the anecdotal evidence, all the quotes are talking about how I'll summarize old people are afraid of the kids.

283
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:22,168
Scott: and because the kids are, did they ask any kids about this?

284
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:22,510
Scott: Oh yeah.

285
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,756
Rym: And the kids are like, this is stupid.

286
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:24,399
Rym: What the fuck?

287
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:27,452
Rym: But some of the other kids are like, I buy everything on Amazon.

288
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,725
Rym: I just go to the mall to hang out and they're right.

289
00:14:32,086 --> 00:14:39,833
Rym: It's interesting how right and simultaneously how wrong the mall owners are because the mall owners argument is that old people feel threatened by youth.

290
00:14:40,094 --> 00:14:40,335
Rym: True.

291
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:44,387
Rym: And they feel threatened and afraid because these kids are.

292
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,314
Scott: the guy who owns the mall actually said that.

293
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:47,017
Rym: Uh, yeah.

294
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,446
Scott: He knows, he knows what's up now.

295
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:53,360
Rym: They know what's up to a degree, but I think they're making a big mistake here.

296
00:14:53,802 --> 00:15:02,359
Rym: So they also point out that, yeah, most of the stores in the mall are aimed at a teenage audience, but at the same time, the mall makes all of its real money from the department stores.

297
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,963
Scott: That's correct.

298
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:04,793
Rym: And all of the old people go to the department stores.

299
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,436
Rym: They're the anchor.

300
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:10,215
Rym: So keeping the old people around and getting away rid of the kids will increase sales.

301
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:11,098
Rym: And in fact it did.

302
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:15,835
Rym: And all these examples, sales went way up because the old people started coming to the mall again.

303
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:16,297
Rym: Yep.

304
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:21,295
Rym: Now this is why I'm so convinced that they only understand half the story.

305
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:25,412
Rym: So they think punk kids come and hang out at my mall and don't spend a lot of money.

306
00:15:25,774 --> 00:15:28,470
Rym: Old people come and spend all their money because this is where they buy all their shit.

307
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,676
Rym: Therefore, by kicking out the kids, the old people who are afraid of the kids will spend more money in my mall until the old people die.

308
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:34,158
Scott: Yes.

309
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,075
Rym: And I think when the old man will die, it's a great short term strategy, right?

310
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:46,635
Scott: You have all these people will spend more money in your malls and all the little tiny stores might go out of business in the midterm and the department stores will make more money in the midterm.

311
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:50,435
Scott: But in the long term, the old people will die and then your mall will be empty and your whole place will shut down.

312
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:51,199
Scott: That'll be it.

313
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:53,510
Scott: And then it'll be a dawn of the dead situation.

314
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,884
Scott: All the malls will be cool, empty places for us to play paintball.

315
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:59,782
Rym: I don't know if they realize it, but seriously, here's one mall after a month of banning kids.

316
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:07,756
Scott: The thing is they might have a chance though, after the old people die, they could be like young kids can come to the mall again and then the mall will be like a party town.

317
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:15,547
Scott: They'll re they'll rework the whole mall and we could turn malls into like, imagine after the old people die, we can rework the malls in the party towns.

318
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:18,239
Rym: No, it's, it's almost a situation.

319
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:19,303
Rym: You've got a mall, right?

320
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:20,508
Scott: We can turn them into convention centers.

321
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:26,472
Rym: Imagine if every storefront in the mall was like that Greek society center, but it was for a different culture.

322
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:28,580
Rym: Like here's the Jersey shore room.

323
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,825
Rym: Here's the star galactic.

324
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,391
Rym: We could buy an old the board games.

325
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:32,698
Scott: We could buy a hippie mall and do it.

326
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:33,200
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,627
Scott: It has just been a really nerdy place.

328
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:37,639
Scott: It'd be an convention in a mall, right?

329
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:38,703
Scott: Each department store.

330
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:44,387
Scott: One department store is the dealer's expo hall and the other one is like the artist's alley and the other one is like a dance party.

331
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:46,496
Scott: And then the other one is like a concert hall.

332
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:50,213
Scott: And then every store is like a different awesome thing at the convention.

333
00:16:50,333 --> 00:17:03,323
Rym: But like sales were up 10% and like people coming to the mall was up 5% after like a month at one of these malls because the quote generally unruly horseplay heavy crowds of children concentrated in the food court and movie theater entrances.

334
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:03,846
Scott: Yeah.

335
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:06,679
Scott: Well, I mean what they should do though is like a lot of malls at.

336
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:12,970
Scott: the movie theater has a door directly to the outside and they can basically just say, look, kids come in the movie theater through the outside door.

337
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,834
Scott: Don't go in the mall.

338
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:28,040
Rym: Every movie worth seeing just about as rated R and the movie theaters won't let them in anyway, which as another aside aside kids, so you know, there is no law saying a movie theater can't sell you a ticket if you're under 18.

339
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,469
Scott: No, but it is the movie theater just decides and they're perfectly, they're allowed to just decide not to sell you at the same time.

340
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:34,635
Rym: One, you should raise a stink.

341
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:36,585
Rym: And two, there are movie theaters.

342
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:38,535
Rym: I don't know if there still are, but there were when I was a kid.

343
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:41,490
Rym: that totally just would sell anyone to take it to anything.

344
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,380
Rym: I saw a lot of R rated movies when I was like 14.

345
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:44,722
Rym: Yeah.

346
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:49,788
Scott: I mean, I have my parents just buy tickets to the R rated movie and give them to us and then we'd walk in and they wouldn't question it.

347
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:52,983
Rym: But here's a, here's a direct quote from the director of one of these malls.

348
00:17:53,305 --> 00:18:00,108
Rym: The problem a developer has is if it becomes a hangout for kids, it becomes scary for old customers.

349
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:00,569
Scott: Yep.

350
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,460
Rym: Like literally they're like old people are afraid of these children.

351
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:03,822
Rym: Yep.

352
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:16,187
Rym: I think malls are going to go away because I, I don't, I realized the last time I went to a mall, there is nothing, absolutely nothing I would ever need from a mall again for the rest of my life.

353
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:17,011
Scott: I'm in New York city.

354
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:18,860
Scott: I can go to a store that's just on the street.

355
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:23,479
Rym: Even in Poughkeepsie when we lived upstate, when we went to the mall for no reason.

356
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,655
Scott: Once we realized we went to the mall a whole bunch and then we didn't go to the mall at all.

357
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:27,037
Rym: Yeah.

358
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:32,201
Rym: But remember we went to the mall and we'd like played DDR and then I realized we never really bought anything.

359
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:33,425
Scott: I got a haircut a few times.

360
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:33,727
Scott: Yeah.

361
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:35,374
Scott: But I bought a few things.

362
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,138
Scott: And

363
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:50,039
Rym: there's this whole funny bit about the end where they're like, part of the reason teams are not able to converge in mass at the mall instead of simply running into a friend or two there is because they have never seen technology like their cell phones and social media like Facebook and Twitter and four square.

364
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:51,445
Rym: Like, yeah, really?

365
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:52,008
Rym: Yeah.

366
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:53,474
Rym: You need a whole paragraph about this.

367
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:56,445
Scott: Anyway, the thing is, right, is it's weird?

368
00:18:56,486 --> 00:19:01,648
Scott: is that we have these societal problems because each group that's causing the problem looks out for themselves.

369
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:01,869
Scott: Right.

370
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:05,502
Scott: So the mall is looking out for money, at least short term money.

371
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:08,112
Scott: The old people looking out not to be scared.

372
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:09,440
Scott: The young kids have no power.

373
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,888
Scott: So it doesn't matter what they're looking out for.

374
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:11,190
Scott: Right.

375
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,476
Scott: But the young kids don't care.

376
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,222
Rym: They'll just go do crystal meth because they can't hang out.

377
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:15,825
Scott: Exactly.

378
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:20,058
Scott: The mall is part of this problem of kids have nothing to do.

379
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:20,499
Scott: Right.

380
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:23,589
Scott: We kids we always say kids don't do drugs.

381
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:24,874
Scott: Kids don't do bad things.

382
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:25,838
Scott: Kids don't join.

383
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:26,521
Scott: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

384
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,314
Rym: To be fair, because we got to qualify that people will argue against you otherwise.

385
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:29,796
Rym: It's not.

386
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:33,576
Rym: the kids don't have anything to do because as a kid, like in New York City, they have something to do.

387
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:36,912
Rym: Even in the in Bumfuck, kids have plenty to do because I got video games.

388
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:37,675
Scott: I had all this.

389
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:39,021
Scott: But that's all they have to do.

390
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:40,245
Scott: So hear me out.

391
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:45,444
Rym: I have infinite entertainment media at my hands, even if I'm like a punk kid in the middle of nowhere.

392
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:51,544
Rym: What I don't have is a place to hang out with my friends where my parents are not there.

393
00:19:51,764 --> 00:19:52,005
Rym: Yep.

394
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:58,731
Scott: I mean, they have like teen community centers, but those are all policed by churchy people and shit like, you know, townie people or whatever.

395
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:00,781
Rym: And half those places, like Rochester.

396
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:01,705
Scott: Only dorks go there.

397
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:04,739
Rym: Remember at RIT, there's that big community center with the Pump It Up machine?

398
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,101
Rym: Yep.

399
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:08,156
Rym: And that place got shut down because there were like riots inside of it.

400
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:10,047
Scott: Well, that was because they had a dance party there one night.

401
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:10,268
Scott: Right.

402
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,495
Scott: And there was a. there was like a riot or something.

403
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:12,876
Scott: Yeah.

404
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:22,266
Scott: But yeah, it's they take away all the places for kids to go because each individual place is better off getting rid of the kids or shutting down.

405
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:23,331
Rym: I mean, even in my hometown as a kid.

406
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:23,572
Rym: Right.

407
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:23,993
Scott: It was.

408
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:24,837
Scott: So what do kids do?

409
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:25,540
Scott: They stay home.

410
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,685
Scott: They get drunk.

411
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:28,051
Scott: They throw drunken parties in their back.

412
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:30,979
Rym: It was against the law to be outside at night.

413
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,497
Scott: If you were under 18, where I grew up, you know, if you would just let the kids make trouble.

414
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:38,524
Scott: That was Dennis the Menace trouble.

415
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:39,206
Scott: Right.

416
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:41,494
Scott: Which is easy to shut down, which is why they shut it down.

417
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:46,150
Scott: Then they wouldn't make trouble, which is fucking Al Capone trouble.

418
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,772
Scott: Right.

419
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:50,065
Scott: So instead, you shut down the Dennis the Menace trouble because you can.

420
00:20:50,085 --> 00:21:06,897
Rym: And while we have a kids doing drugs, I think there's also a secondary point that people don't seem to realize that a lot of the institutions of our society are not in any way valuable to at least the techno Roddy, like modern generation of people like us.

421
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:07,318
Rym: Yeah.

422
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:17,062
Rym: I mean, a ball to anyone who's even remotely like me, culturally, there is fuck all reason to go to a mall unless you're going to the movie theater attached to them all, because that's where the fucking movie theater is.

423
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:17,545
Scott: Yeah.

424
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:18,913
Scott: It just happens to be there.

425
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:21,223
Rym: And maybe you'll go to the GameStop, but you know what?

426
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:25,844
Rym: GameStops are going to go away because they're just pawn shops and our first sale rights are going away.

427
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,712
Rym: So you can see what's happening here.

428
00:21:27,732 --> 00:21:32,089
Rym: I think within 10 years, more than half the malls in America are going to shut down.

429
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,852
Scott: I mean, scary thing is some places have like newer malls.

430
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:36,753
Scott: Yeah.

431
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:45,260
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

432
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,748
Rym: So this video was on CollegeHumor a little while ago.

433
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:53,554
Rym: And while it's crazy awesome, the video alone wasn't worth being a thing of the day because there's no context.

434
00:21:53,614 --> 00:22:05,495
Rym: It's just kind of intense, sort of scary music as a dude is set on fire and literally jumps out through the window of a skyscraper and lands on a mat with no parachute.

435
00:22:05,635 --> 00:22:07,544
Scott: and a parachute wouldn't help because he was on fire.

436
00:22:07,604 --> 00:22:09,655
Scott: So the parachute would have also been on fire.

437
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:10,619
Rym: I mean, I watched the video.

438
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,847
Rym: I'm like, all right, what's this guy going to do?

439
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:12,189
Rym: All right.

440
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:12,834
Rym: Some sort of stunt.

441
00:22:12,854 --> 00:22:17,252
Scott: So holy shit, actually jumped out of skyscraper window on fire, on fire.

442
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:19,602
Scott: It wasn't like tricks or cameras or anything.

443
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:23,120
Scott: He actually was on fire, actually jumped out the window, actually had no parachute.

444
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,409
Scott: Parachute actually would not have helped because he was on fire.

445
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:31,647
Rym: So I dug around and I figured out what the deal was for a movie.

446
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:33,173
Rym: No, it wasn't for a movie.

447
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:34,880
Rym: It was a stuntman, Bob Brown.

448
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:37,188
Scott: Was he promoting himself to get more jobs?

449
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:38,072
Rym: I believe.

450
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:38,835
Rym: I'm not sure.

451
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:45,756
Rym: I believe he's promoting brand X, a kind of airbag that you can land on like what he landed.

452
00:22:45,856 --> 00:22:51,938
Scott: Oh, so he's trying to sell stuntman equipment to other movies or something like that so they can do crazier stunts.

453
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:56,353
Rym: Mostly this article talks about how they did the stunt, who the guy was.

454
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:59,584
Rym: He's like forty three to so badass dude.

455
00:22:59,684 --> 00:23:01,772
Scott: They set him on fire in the usual movie way.

456
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:06,450
Scott: It was a fake window that he broke through so he wouldn't cut himself up with shards of glass.

457
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:10,847
Scott: They had an incredibly big mattress at the bottom with fire extinguishers, you know.

458
00:23:11,168 --> 00:23:11,389
Rym: Yep.

459
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,131
Rym: It's just.

460
00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:14,599
Rym: it's quite a thing to see.

461
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:17,104
Scott: So there you have it.

462
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:18,208
Scott: My thing of the day.

463
00:23:18,248 --> 00:23:23,896
Scott: So, you know, we mentioned Dagen H, at least we referred to it earlier in the show, but we've talked about that before.

464
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:24,621
Scott: It was the thing of the day.

465
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:26,770
Rym: We should probably explain briefly again what it is.

466
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:28,417
Scott: Dagen H was the day.

467
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:29,160
Scott: What country was it?

468
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,164
Scott: Norway, maybe?

469
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:30,868
Rym: I don't remember.

470
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:31,873
Rym: I think it was Denmark.

471
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:34,002
Scott: It was one of those northern European countries.

472
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,809
Scott: And what they did is they had the roads.

473
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,273
Scott: Sweden!

474
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,700
Rym: I'm sorry, every listener from Scandinavia.

475
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:44,799
Scott: So they had the roads on the left and they switched them to be on the right.

476
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:45,843
Rym: You know what the H stands for?

477
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:48,012
Scott: It's because they... Hogertraffic.

478
00:23:48,614 --> 00:23:53,540
Scott: Oh, I thought it was because, you know, if you think of a road and you think of an H and it's like, aha, we're switching the roads.

479
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:56,915
Scott: The shape of an H really makes it seem like a road switching.

480
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:07,835
Rym: I can see how you would get that from the picture of the reminder, you know, the logo for Dagen H. But Wikipedia right away, the H stands for Hogertraffic, the Swedish word for right-handed traffic.

481
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:08,397
Scott: Yep.

482
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:13,280
Scott: So basically they had the cars drove on the left like England and now they drive in the right like the US.

483
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,183
Rym: Like the civilized world.

484
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,459
Scott: And they had a day that was Dagen H, which is a day they switched it.

485
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:25,810
Scott: And now what I say is when I say something is a Dagen H, like because I referred to a Dagen H for the drug war, is basically in the US.

486
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,162
Scott: they really, really, really don't like sweeping and rapid change.

487
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:31,071
Scott: Everything we have to do gradually, right?

488
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:35,129
Scott: If we're going to change some rate, we have to change the rate a little bit each day.

489
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,500
Scott: We can't just make change the rate a whole bunch in one day.

490
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:39,610
Scott: They got to do everything slowly, right?

491
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:42,603
Scott: If we're going to increase something, we got to increase it slowly.

492
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:45,916
Scott: So there isn't this rapid, you know, and drastic sweeping change.

493
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:47,241
Scott: that is, you know, instant.

494
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:54,207
Scott: So when I said we should have a Dagen H for the drug war, I said I was meaning we should just turn it off one, you know, immediately.

495
00:24:54,568 --> 00:25:00,733
Scott: And instead of being like, OK, well, this year it'll be OK to do pot like this and next year we'll allow a little more pot.

496
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:01,134
Scott: Fuck that.

497
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:01,516
Scott: Right.

498
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:05,428
Scott: So I'm trying to find examples of Dagen Hs from around the world.

499
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:05,769
Scott: Drug war.

500
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,925
Scott: To show Dagen Hs that actually happened already.

501
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:11,567
Scott: Right.

502
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:13,494
Scott: You could almost argue that.

503
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:15,301
Scott: Didn't Portugal do a Dagen H for drugs?

504
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:18,389
Rym: Czechoslovakia did for Dagen Hing for driving.

505
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:18,449
Rym: OK,

506
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:37,215
Scott: yeah, but anyway, the thing is trying to find examples of Dagen Hs from around the world to show that, look, if you do it right, you can do a big change that and that succeeds for a whole country or even a bigger area all at once and do a big fix to the world quickly and effectively.

507
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:38,701
Scott: And it's not something to be afraid of.

508
00:25:39,182 --> 00:25:46,507
Rym: I think there's a much more fundamental idea here that Dagen H proved that a society as a whole can agree this is worth doing.

509
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:49,115
Rym: We're all all going to pitch in.

510
00:25:49,196 --> 00:25:52,392
Rym: I mean, this isn't something that a government could just say, yeah, on this day we're doing it.

511
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:52,995
Rym: It just happens.

512
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:59,343
Rym: Every single goddamn person in that country had to be ready for it, had to be prepared, had to know about it, had to be educated.

513
00:25:59,664 --> 00:25:59,865
Rym: Yep.

514
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,311
Scott: And I mean, the U.S.

515
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:03,440
Scott: sort of did it when we cut off the TV broadcast.

516
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:07,434
Scott: That was sort of a Dagen H. Yeah, we kept delaying it, but we did.

517
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:07,976
Scott: It's done.

518
00:26:08,036 --> 00:26:10,987
Rym: We Dagen H'd away alcohol and then we Dagen H'd it back.

519
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:11,610
Scott: That's true.

520
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:17,753
Scott: That was a bad Dagen H. Anyway, so I found about this this Dagen H I had not heard of before in Brazil.

521
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:18,918
Scott: that was very successful.

522
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:23,680
Scott: And basically you can read the article and listen to the NPR audio to get all the details.

523
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,264
Scott: But here's the story.

524
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:32,556
Scott: Brazil had crazy inflation, the kind of inflation they have in Zimbabwe, where eggs are a dollar one day and a dollar two cents the next day.

525
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:35,267
Scott: And by the end of the year, they're a thousand dollars an egg and it's out of control.

526
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:36,813
Scott: And this is like in the 90s.

527
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:41,414
Scott: So every politician who came along was said, I'm going to fix the inflation.

528
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:43,182
Scott: And they tried everything and nothing worked.

529
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:48,603
Scott: And every time they voted for someone new, they were like, OK, what are you going to do to fix the inflation?

530
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:57,732
Scott: So eventually what happened was a new president came in and he had a finance minister and the finance minister was stupid.

531
00:26:57,853 --> 00:27:04,218
Scott: He wasn't completely stupid, but he knew it was one of those situations where he didn't know, but he knew he didn't know.

532
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:06,547
Scott: He knew that he did not know about economics.

533
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:08,193
Rym: That is a rare person.

534
00:27:08,353 --> 00:27:10,120
Scott: How did he become a finance minister?

535
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,352
Scott: I don't know, but I don't do what Donnie Don't does.

536
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:14,322
Scott: He knew that he didn't know anything about economics.

537
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:21,088
Scott: So he went to to the university and he found the smart guys who were always hanging at the bar talking about how to fix inflation.

538
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:24,900
Scott: And he said, you smart economic types, fix inflation.

539
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:41,717
Scott: And they fixed inflation with a Dagen H. What they did is they said, OK, starting today, everyone's going to keep using the Crissero, the currency of Brazil, but we're going to change all the prices on all the shelves, right, to be in reales, URVs, units of real value.

540
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:42,219
Scott: Right.

541
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:45,069
Scott: So if went to the store, eggs would be one real.

542
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:51,880
Scott: Now, when you went to the checkout counter, right, the guy would have a little chart and the chart would say, yeah, today one real is 20 Crisseros.

543
00:27:52,281 --> 00:27:55,414
Scott: And because of inflation, the next day one real might be 40 Crisseros.

544
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:58,506
Scott: But the price on the shelf was always one real.

545
00:27:58,967 --> 00:27:59,208
Scott: Right.

546
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,094
Scott: So nothing really changed.

547
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:02,639
Scott: Just people's perception changed.

548
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:03,984
Scott: People began to value money.

549
00:28:04,285 --> 00:28:06,955
Scott: And the problem with inflation is money loses value.

550
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:11,575
Scott: So psychologically, people are now valuing money or at least they're valuing the real.

551
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:13,062
Scott: They're not valuing the Crissero.

552
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:13,544
Scott: Right.

553
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,910
Scott: Because the real is stable.

554
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,236
Scott: It stays at one all the time.

555
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:17,581
Scott: Eggs are always one real.

556
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:18,423
Scott: Real must be real.

557
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:27,836
Scott: And then on the Dagen H, he said, all right, today we're going to take all the Crisseros and throw them in the trash and we're going to distribute reales.

558
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:29,825
Scott: And everyone went to the bank or whatever.

559
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:35,689
Scott: And, you know, during the whole period, right, they weren't using reales, but their paychecks were listed in reales.

560
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:46,653
Scott: And every everything was on paper was reales, but they physically used Crisseros and just exchange them all the time on this Dagen H. Everyone threw away the Crisseros and exchange them for reales.

561
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,422
Scott: And they printed up the reales and gave them out.

562
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:52,241
Scott: And ever since then, Brazil has been just kicking everybody's ass, going up and up and up.

563
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:56,073
Scott: Economy is awesome in Brazil ever since they did this.

564
00:28:56,093 --> 00:29:00,851
Scott: And it's an awesome Dagen H. And I think the rest of the world needs similar Dagen H's.

565
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,642
Rym: I think we'll do a show on some Dagen H's in the future.

566
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,576
Rym: So if you know of any that we do not know of, let us know.

567
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:06,817
Rym: Yeah.

568
00:29:06,837 --> 00:29:15,955
Scott: I want to make like a website like Dagen H's like plural and talk about all of them because they are they're awesome, especially if you find like a really old historic one.

569
00:29:15,996 --> 00:29:16,619
Scott: That'd be awesome, too.

570
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:21,213
Rym: So I suppose briefly we should have the meta moment.

571
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:24,362
Scott: So the next convention we're going to is Magfest.

572
00:29:24,402 --> 00:29:26,147
Scott: Magfest in January.

573
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,233
Rym: And then PAX East in March.

574
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:29,416
Rym: Hotels are live.

575
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:31,585
Scott: Yes, get your PAX East hotel now.

576
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:36,532
Scott: Otherwise, you're going to be in a hotel that you're going to need like a shuttle or a taxi or the take the transportation of some sort.

577
00:29:36,612 --> 00:29:39,687
Rym: The fuck now I'm going to get to the convention center right now.

578
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:43,787
Rym: If you want to go to hotel is the Western Boston waterfront is connected to the convention center.

579
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:45,295
Rym: It is the closest hotel you can get.

580
00:29:45,315 --> 00:29:46,943
Rym: And it's cheaper than the Renaissance.

581
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:49,898
Scott: The food might be far away, but the convention center is close.

582
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:51,185
Scott: And that's where you're going to be most of the time.

583
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:59,803
Rym: However, there there is the benefit of look at Connecticut, the situation where the food and the cheap hotel are way far away from the convention center, which is good.

584
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:02,037
Scott: But you don't really see the difference is a Connecticut.

585
00:30:02,057 --> 00:30:04,348
Scott: It's OK if you get to the convention a little late.

586
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:06,015
Scott: You're not in a rush, but it packs.

587
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:08,887
Scott: You don't want to fucking miss one minute of packs.

588
00:30:09,128 --> 00:30:09,831
Scott: So you want to be close.

589
00:30:10,112 --> 00:30:11,939
Rym: Don't want to close my eyes.

590
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,735
Rym: Anyway, the book club book is World War Z by Max Brooks.

591
00:30:17,876 --> 00:30:18,839
Scott: It's about zombies.

592
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:21,906
Scott: You indirectly asked for it independently.

593
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:27,667
Rym: I saw the movie or the TV trailer poster things and everything for Walking Dead, the series.

594
00:30:28,331 --> 00:30:28,532
Scott: Yeah.

595
00:30:28,552 --> 00:30:31,366
Scott: I mean, I knew they were making it and I saw that was promotional stuff.

596
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:33,779
Scott: It's actually a good poster at the image booth at the comic.

597
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:39,426
Rym: It's like the freeway all shut down, like all the disaster and just one guy walking toward the city on the empty road on a horse.

598
00:30:39,687 --> 00:30:39,908
Scott: Yeah.

599
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:40,832
Scott: Additional meta.

600
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:48,006
Scott: You should follow GeekNights on Twitter and it'll tell you about old episodes and also new episodes that we're treating out random episodes every day.

601
00:30:48,026 --> 00:30:50,920
Scott: You should come to the forum at forum dot for a great outcome forms.

602
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,582
Rym: Pretty rocket.

603
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,491
Scott: You should also just go to front row crew dot com.

604
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:59,943
Scott: And, you know, because that's the Web site for this podcast and you should go to it instead of just looking at iTunes and never going to our Web site.

605
00:31:00,003 --> 00:31:00,405
Scott: Yeah.

606
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:01,491
Rym: The stuff on the Web site.

607
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:01,852
Rym: Yeah.

608
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:02,234
Scott: Jerks.

609
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:02,837
Scott: Not that much.

610
00:31:03,098 --> 00:31:05,347
Scott: There's news there and shit, but there's going to be more there soon.

611
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:05,889
Scott: A lot.

612
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,411
Scott: It's coming.

613
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,226
Rym: OK, so, Scott, something happened not that long ago.

614
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:11,487
Rym: Yeah.

615
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:15,802
Scott: So a week from yesterday, so eight days ago on Wednesday.

616
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:16,424
Scott: Right.

617
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:23,629
Scott: I came home from work and it was, you know, I was planning to do with Scott's box because the box was arriving that day.

618
00:31:24,272 --> 00:31:25,998
Scott: So, of course, it was after a podcast.

619
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,645
Scott: I was actually Scott's box the next day.

620
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:29,514
Scott: I didn't end up doing it until yesterday.

621
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,241
Scott: So it was delayed like a whole week.

622
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:34,493
Scott: And then the recording on Ustream totally failed.

623
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:34,995
Scott: I'm sorry.

624
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:36,340
Scott: Nothing I could do about that.

625
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,885
Scott: It was their fault.

626
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:41,579
Scott: And I get home and I go to my front door and on the floor is Scott's box.

627
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:44,632
Scott: I pick it up and then I look to go put my key in the door.

628
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:49,772
Scott: And I noticed that right near the handle for my door, there is significant physical damage to my door.

629
00:31:50,395 --> 00:31:52,383
Scott: And I push the door without even putting the key in.

630
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,145
Scott: And it just opens.

631
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,344
Scott: And I'm like, oh, as soon as I saw the damage, I was like, all right, I got burgled.

632
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,770
Scott: Let's let's see what's missing.

633
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:04,728
Scott: And I opened the door and I took my TV and my Xbox and my Wii.

634
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:06,697
Scott: Those are the obvious missing things right away.

635
00:32:06,877 --> 00:32:07,540
Rym: I just can't believe.

636
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:09,692
Rym: you called me and you're like, I got robbed.

637
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:10,235
Rym: I'm like, what do you mean?

638
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:10,677
Rym: he got robbed?

639
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:14,754
Scott: Apparently, I found out even more recently the guy upstairs also got robbed, but no one else.

640
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:17,124
Scott: Oh, or at least he got broken into.

641
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:17,405
Scott: He didn't.

642
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:18,430
Scott: He just wrote a note.

643
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:18,852
Scott: I didn't.

644
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:20,742
Scott: I don't know what was taken or anything.

645
00:32:20,863 --> 00:32:21,285
Scott: It doesn't matter.

646
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:22,029
Rym: Maybe he robbed you.

647
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:22,834
Rym: This cover story.

648
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:23,799
Scott: No, I don't think so.

649
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:25,607
Scott: I'm pretty sure what it was.

650
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:29,868
Scott: There was this guy, you know, those guys who go on the street and they're like from Greenpeace or whatever.

651
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:30,875
Scott: This guy was from U.N.

652
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:31,478
Scott: something, something.

653
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,954
Scott: And they're always trying to get you to give money to some charity or something.

654
00:32:33,974 --> 00:32:36,085
Scott: And they have those clipboards full of paper.

655
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:37,472
Scott: And they're really annoying and pushy.

656
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:39,099
Rym: Yeah, I like that.

657
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:40,365
Rym: I don't speak English at this point.

658
00:32:40,385 --> 00:32:40,968
Rym: There was a guy.

659
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:43,520
Scott: there was a guy like that in our building walking around.

660
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,046
Rym: Yeah, that seems suspicious.

661
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:46,713
Scott: How did he get into the building?

662
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,882
Rym: I mean, your building's locked as fuck.

663
00:32:48,922 --> 00:32:49,988
Rym: My building is a doorman.

664
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:51,435
Rym: You can't like people can't just walk in.

665
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:51,858
Scott: Yeah.

666
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:56,739
Scott: But anyway, he was in the building the previous night and I basically, you know, was like, screw you, go away.

667
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,011
Scott: So maybe he was like, aha, that guy's a jerk.

668
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:02,221
Scott: I won't give to the poor, flooded people in Pakistan.

669
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,184
Scott: It's OK to rob him.

670
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:04,950
Scott: But, you know, whatever.

671
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,134
Scott: See,

672
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:19,673
Rym: I think because I have it seems obvious that if I were going to rob a little apartment building like that, I would send someone in with some nice excuse who would never go back to the place to basically case it out and see whoever has the most expensive TVs, rob them

673
00:33:20,115 --> 00:33:20,657
Scott: and no one else.

674
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:21,260
Scott: Yeah, probably.

675
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,410
Scott: The thing is, they didn't take any of my computers.

676
00:33:23,873 --> 00:33:24,959
Scott: You know, they didn't take out.

677
00:33:24,999 --> 00:33:27,474
Scott: There's a whole bunch of valuable things they didn't take that they could have taken.

678
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:28,701
Rym: They're probably in a hurry.

679
00:33:29,264 --> 00:33:29,546
Scott: I don't know.

680
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:30,692
Scott: They're in a hurry, but they took a TV.

681
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:31,938
Rym: They stole your stinky blanket.

682
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:32,220
Rym: Yeah.

683
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,769
Scott: It's like after I, you know, when the police showed up pretty quickly and then detectives and then the evidence people showed up at two a.m.

684
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:38,634
Scott: and they didn't find anything.

685
00:33:38,674 --> 00:33:42,992
Scott: But the thing was is like as time went on, I discovered more missing things.

686
00:33:43,032 --> 00:33:45,321
Scott: It's like my DS and a whole thing full of games.

687
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:49,457
Scott: And actually, I was lucky that Emily took a bunch of my DS games from me.

688
00:33:49,518 --> 00:33:53,373
Scott: So they didn't take as many as they would have otherwise taken at random aside.

689
00:33:53,453 --> 00:33:56,545
Rym: So after you got robbed, I realized I didn't know where my DS was.

690
00:33:56,585 --> 00:33:57,769
Rym: I hadn't seen it in months.

691
00:33:58,532 --> 00:33:59,737
Rym: So I found it today.

692
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:00,560
Rym: It was rainy, right?

693
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:03,251
Rym: I put on my trench coat that was in the trench.

694
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:03,573
Scott: Yeah.

695
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:04,940
Rym: And I feel something heavy in the pocket.

696
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,601
Rym: I'm like, what the fuck?

697
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:09,150
Rym: And there's my DS still on on suspended.

698
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,032
Rym: I opened it.

699
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:14,141
Rym: There's two months.

700
00:34:14,362 --> 00:34:16,326
Rym: Whoa.

701
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:20,577
Scott: Anyway, so but yeah, it's weird.

702
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:23,364
Scott: It's like they took the HDMI cables, but they didn't take the Wii cable.

703
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:24,128
Scott: Right.

704
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,032
Scott: And then.

705
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:25,694
Scott: Right.

706
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:30,594
Scott: Like a day later, they actually started spending my Xbox money that I can't believe this.

707
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,120
Rym: This is one thing that bothers me.

708
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,024
Rym: I mean, I don't care, you know, from because you don't care if the guy gets caught or not because you got insurance.

709
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:36,547
Scott: It doesn't yet.

710
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,183
Scott: Whether the guy is caught makes no difference in my life whatsoever.

711
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,853
Scott: But I still unless he's planning a repeat.

712
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,809
Rym: But I want him caught for, you know, obviously social justice reasons.

713
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,036
Scott: Yeah, but that doesn't matter.

714
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:46,202
Scott: You know, it doesn't make a difference.

715
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,469
Rym: It does in the long run.

716
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,181
Rym: I mean, people who get away with crimes are more likely to commit more crimes.

717
00:34:50,804 --> 00:34:51,326
Scott: Is that true?

718
00:34:51,545 --> 00:34:53,772
Rym: Probably anyway.

719
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:56,900
Scott: But that aside, recidivism is pretty high.

720
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:01,456
Rym: The fact that he bought shit with your Xbox as an IT professional.

721
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:06,272
Rym: There is nothing between you, the police and knowing where the fuck the dude is.

722
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:08,559
Rym: But bureaucracy from Microsoft.

723
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,323
Scott: Yeah, like Microsoft.

724
00:35:09,363 --> 00:35:21,883
Scott: You know, I told that, you know, I called the detective and I called Microsoft and Microsoft, you know, they're doing that whole thing, I guess, where they find the IP and then they peed at the ISP and, you know, I guess they're going to do that thing that you always hear about them doing.

725
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:23,288
Scott: So, yeah, whatever.

726
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:30,172
Rym: I look forward to them because the dude must not be that smart or he must have already sold the smart.

727
00:35:30,192 --> 00:35:31,316
Scott: Why did he take my computers?

728
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,762
Scott: Why did he not take the cable?

729
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:35,414
Rym: Because your computers are weird and custom and those difficult defense.

730
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:36,258
Rym: Maybe he took.

731
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,333
Rym: Look, he took very generic stuff that's easy to reset.

732
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:41,965
Scott: But he didn't want to resell it all because he didn't resell the Xbox.

733
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,815
Scott: He used it or maybe he sold it to somebody.

734
00:35:43,835 --> 00:35:45,806
Rym: Maybe he did resell it, which is fine, because you know what?

735
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,846
Rym: If they find the Xbox and it isn't the thief, guys still loses the Xbox.

736
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:50,832
Rym: It doesn't get any money back.

737
00:35:51,013 --> 00:35:51,375
Scott: That's true.

738
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:52,964
Scott: But your antenna DVD was in the Xbox.

739
00:35:53,024 --> 00:35:53,306
Rym: I know.

740
00:35:53,326 --> 00:35:54,794
Rym: I want you to find the goddamn Xbox.

741
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,322
Scott: The thing is, you 10 is getting re-released.

742
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:56,804
Rym: So I know.

743
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:57,366
Rym: But that was the.

744
00:35:57,687 --> 00:36:01,462
Rym: I bought that, you know, all 13 episodes of season one on two disks.

745
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:04,774
Rym: I bought that back when money was not something I had.

746
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:12,708
Scott: I mean, the only real major loss is like there are Pokémon that I had in Pokémon Red back in the day that I traded up and traded up and traded up were in the Pokémon Diamond.

747
00:36:12,868 --> 00:36:13,551
Scott: Oh, shit.

748
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:15,218
Scott: But it's like, really?

749
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:20,859
Rym: I'm going to get upset about if Nintendo were smart and nice and had the Pokémon MMO and the Pokémon.

750
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,084
Scott: That wouldn't be an issue.

751
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:23,148
Scott: Yeah.

752
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:25,638
Rym: Pokémon Cloud, my Pokémon or my Pokémon forever.

753
00:36:25,658 --> 00:36:26,180
Scott: That's right.

754
00:36:26,962 --> 00:36:27,786
Scott: Let's do it, Nintendo.

755
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:29,153
Scott: They're failing at all internets.

756
00:36:29,374 --> 00:36:29,796
Rym: There's a reason.

757
00:36:29,836 --> 00:36:32,809
Rym: we did a whole panel at PAX on why Nintendo is full of assholes.

758
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:37,572
Scott: I mean, there's not really much to say about getting burgled because it's not like it was an adventure.

759
00:36:37,593 --> 00:36:39,302
Scott: I was there and fought them with or anything.

760
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,054
Scott: But I did think about like, what if I had to fight them?

761
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:47,957
Scott: And I realized the knife would have been a bad idea because more likely to hurt myself and also get blood everywhere.

762
00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:57,230
Rym: if I actually succeed, you know, large like weird bludgeoning instruments like a steel folding chair just kind of whipped at someone will take them out enough.

763
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,208
Scott: But also, they obviously broke in with a crowbar so they would have had a crowbar.

764
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:03,560
Rym: Anyone who tries to wield a crowbar is not going to do that well.

765
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:04,224
Scott: You think so?

766
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:05,229
Rym: Against a baseball bat?

767
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,376
Scott: Oh, I don't have a baseball bat.

768
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:07,421
Rym: You don't have a baseball bat?

769
00:37:07,502 --> 00:37:10,876
Scott: No, but I bought a rolling pin recently, which I bought it to.

770
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:12,763
Scott: actually, I bought it to roll, not to hit.

771
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:16,917
Scott: And I do have the honing steel that goes with the knives.

772
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:17,760
Rym: That'll hurt someone.

773
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,950
Scott: That's a pretty good whacking stick, right?

774
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,080
Rym: I would say taser, but they're illegal in New York.

775
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,782
Scott: Are they really?

776
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:24,308
Scott: Yeah, which sucks.

777
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:25,031
Scott: Yeah.

778
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:30,394
Scott: I mean, there's, you know, pretty much here's, I'm going to get, since there's not much adventure story to tell, right?

779
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:31,137
Scott: I got robbed.

780
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:32,081
Scott: I'm buying new shit.

781
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:32,703
Scott: I have insurance.

782
00:37:32,743 --> 00:37:33,847
Scott: End of story, right?

783
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:40,408
Scott: Here's my advice for what you should do pre and post getting robbed to make out.

784
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:41,010
Scott: well, right?

785
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:45,486
Scott: Number one, renter's insurance is like, usually I'm anti insurance, right?

786
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:48,638
Scott: You know, and because insurance is usually a rip, right?

787
00:37:48,678 --> 00:37:51,067
Scott: I mean, by definition, it's gambling and the house always wins.

788
00:37:51,629 --> 00:37:58,553
Scott: But renter's insurance is actually, even though the house always wins, the bet is so low.

789
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:01,142
Scott: It's like a hundred and something bucks for a year.

790
00:38:01,383 --> 00:38:07,927
Rym: Homeowners insurance, the, the, the, the value of saving you a pain in the ass at a bunch of, basically it's a losing bet, right?

791
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:14,354
Scott: Odds are you're going to lose that money, but it's such a small amount of money and the potential payoff is so big.

792
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:18,733
Scott: It's like, imagine if there was a lottery, right now, the lottery is a losing bet because it's $1.

793
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:25,460
Scott: I mean, you're only spending $1 and there's a multi-million possible payoff, but the odds of winning are like one in a billion almost.

794
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,368
Scott: So it's really bad idea.

795
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:30,239
Rym: What if the lottery ticket was a 10th of a cent?

796
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:32,207
Scott: Yeah, the lottery tickets, basically a hundred dollars.

797
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:36,082
Scott: The payoff is like tens of thousands possibly, right?

798
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:41,917
Scott: But, uh, the odds of winning are like one in, you know, thousands.

799
00:38:42,057 --> 00:38:48,019
Scott: So it's still a losing bet, but it's such a small bet with a big payoff and the odds aren't all that bad.

800
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,243
Scott: It's like, they're okay.

801
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,709
Scott: Better odds, but okay.

802
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:57,872
Rym: Every year I consider and then decide wisely not to buy one of those thousand dollar raffle tickets for the Lamborghini.

803
00:38:58,173 --> 00:38:58,394
Scott: Yeah.

804
00:38:58,414 --> 00:39:00,344
Scott: So you mean the Maseratis and whatever.

805
00:39:00,365 --> 00:39:01,652
Rym: There's only 400 tickets.

806
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,980
Rym: I actually got a decent chance of winning.

807
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,793
Scott: Real decent, but you're probably throwing away a thousand dollars.

808
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:07,863
Rym: The thing is if I win it, I'm fucked.

809
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:09,611
Scott: You sell it immediately.

810
00:39:09,632 --> 00:39:11,260
Rym: Yeah, but then that's not my income tax.

811
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:12,282
Scott: I think.

812
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:13,648
Scott: Yeah, but you only, you can take half.

813
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:14,431
Scott: So if it's $200,000 car, you get $100,000.

814
00:39:14,431 --> 00:39:14,491
Scott: Yep.

815
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,263
Rym: Which wouldn't be that bad.

816
00:39:17,283 --> 00:39:21,767
Scott: But you spent a thousand and you had a one in 400 chance of multiplying the money by a hundred.

817
00:39:21,848 --> 00:39:24,339
Scott: I'd really want a roulette table is a better idea.

818
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:27,293
Rym: I really want to keep it, but insurance alone would cost more than my apartment.

819
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:27,756
Scott: That's right.

820
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,409
Scott: Anyway, so here, here's my advice, right?

821
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:36,375
Scott: Homeowners and renters insurance or homeowners insurance or whatever is actually a good idea, depending where you live, right?

822
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:41,582
Scott: If I lived in the boonies, when I was in beacon, I didn't buy the rent just insurance, but in New York city, I bought the renter's insurance.

823
00:39:41,622 --> 00:39:42,866
Scott: It was so cheap, right?

824
00:39:42,886 --> 00:39:45,554
Scott: Um, second thing, right?

825
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:50,620
Scott: It's good to buy everything on the internet because that renters insurance they're going to make, they're going to want you.

826
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,356
Scott: It's not necessary, but they're going to want you and they'll like it.

827
00:39:53,396 --> 00:39:54,984
Scott: If you can prove you actually own the stuff.

828
00:39:55,507 --> 00:39:58,360
Scott: So I was like, here's the printouts of all these invoices from Amazon.

829
00:39:59,042 --> 00:39:59,403
Scott: I own it.

830
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:00,267
Scott: I bought it here.

831
00:40:00,328 --> 00:40:00,569
Scott: Proof.

832
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,704
Scott: You don't have to save receipts in a folder or anything stupid like that, right?

833
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:06,218
Scott: Like you did in the olden days, you can throw your seats all away.

834
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:09,252
Scott: Cause it's all recorded on the internet in stone for all eternity.

835
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,983
Scott: I could, I could show you everything I've ever bought an Amazon ever.

836
00:40:12,103 --> 00:40:12,645
Scott: It's all there.

837
00:40:13,046 --> 00:40:13,227
Scott: Right?

838
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:14,029
Scott: So I owned it.

839
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:15,233
Scott: Screw you.

840
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:17,118
Scott: Other advice.

841
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:20,793
Scott: And I, you know, I've told people before I've known this advice already.

842
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:24,410
Scott: You should use a credit card for everything in your entire life that you possibly can.

843
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:24,671
Scott: Yep.

844
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:26,662
Scott: There's no reason not to use a credit card.

845
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:30,702
Rym: Aside from all the benefits of the credit card, it's a huge buffer between your money and your stuff.

846
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:30,883
Scott: Right?

847
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:33,979
Scott: So here are the reasons to use a credit card that we already knew, right?

848
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:35,887
Scott: Reason number one, it's easy.

849
00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:37,012
Scott: You don't have to carry cash.

850
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:38,981
Scott: If someone steals it, you just change the number.

851
00:40:39,081 --> 00:40:40,506
Scott: It's really safe, right?

852
00:40:40,526 --> 00:40:44,278
Scott: Uh, reason number two, increased liquidity, right?

853
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,106
Scott: You can keep your cash till the end of the month.

854
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:50,708
Scott: And then you're totally, you know, so if any emergency happens, you actually have more money on hand.

855
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:52,296
Scott: It's, it's a safer financial bet.

856
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:52,677
Scott: Yep.

857
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:55,048
Scott: It's like, it's like a free temporary no interest loan.

858
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:55,791
Scott: That's 30 days.

859
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:58,362
Scott: And you should always, you're always paying off every month.

860
00:40:58,382 --> 00:41:02,222
Scott: If you don't pay it off every month, you're a moron or it was an emergency, which is justified.

861
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:08,510
Scott: Uh, another reason to use a credit card for absolutely everything is it's really easy to stop payment or dispute a payment.

862
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:08,831
Rym: Yep.

863
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:12,272
Rym: Do you know how many times someone's given me trouble and I'm just like, I'll charge back the credit card.

864
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:12,372
Scott: Yeah.

865
00:41:12,393 --> 00:41:13,782
Scott: We're not just talking about column right.

866
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:15,412
Scott: The we're not just talking about fraud.

867
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:17,141
Scott: We're talking about just people were a jerk, right?

868
00:41:17,222 --> 00:41:23,991
Scott: If I call the plumber and I pay him with my credit card and then the plumber like doesn't do a good job, I'll just unpay the plumber.

869
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:25,598
Scott: You just take the money right back.

870
00:41:25,638 --> 00:41:27,808
Scott: If I paid him with cash, that's a lot harder to do, isn't it?

871
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:28,230
Scott: Yep.

872
00:41:28,431 --> 00:41:33,814
Scott: You know, uh, but with the credit card, yoink debit, it's even harder to do, but credit card yoink, right?

873
00:41:34,256 --> 00:41:35,943
Scott: You know, people think credit cards are evil.

874
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:37,309
Scott: They're only evil to businesses.

875
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,278
Scott: They're awesome for you swiping the card.

876
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:39,900
Scott: All right.

877
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:40,704
Scott: In every single way.

878
00:41:41,407 --> 00:41:46,271
Scott: Now here are additional reasons to use a credit card for absolutely everything in your entire life that we didn't already know.

879
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:47,417
Scott: And these are.

880
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:50,230
Scott: this is just two things that I learned about my American Express card.

881
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:52,682
Scott: But many other credit cards have similar things.

882
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:55,653
Scott: Look up your credit card policy information, whatever.

883
00:41:56,738 --> 00:41:59,027
Scott: Here is two things about American Express card.

884
00:41:59,047 --> 00:41:59,991
Scott: The one I have, I didn't know.

885
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:07,322
Scott: Number one, apparently, if I buy something as a manufacturer's warranty, it's like automatically extended like American Express just extends it.

886
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:13,627
Scott: So if I have something that, say, has a 90 day warranty and it breaks like 100 day, I just call American Express.

887
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:14,229
Scott: They got covered.

888
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,355
Scott: It's all good, right?

889
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:16,982
Scott: It's as if the warranty was longer.

890
00:42:17,384 --> 00:42:21,221
Scott: Just got to call the credit card company instead of the manufacturer first or whatever.

891
00:42:21,463 --> 00:42:23,694
Scott: And it's just take care of something else I learned.

892
00:42:24,015 --> 00:42:28,130
Scott: Let's say I buy something and within 90 days it's lost and or stolen.

893
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,778
Scott: So I buy DS and 50 days later I lose it.

894
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,139
Scott: Oh, shit.

895
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,142
Scott: American Express just buys me a new one.

896
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:35,828
Scott: Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

897
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,572
Scott: Just because I used my credit card.

898
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:38,294
Scott: Right.

899
00:42:38,595 --> 00:42:40,884
Scott: That's all you got to do.

900
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:42,832
Scott: Nothing else is going to give you that kind of benefit.

901
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:43,858
Scott: And this doesn't even count.

902
00:42:43,878 --> 00:42:43,999
Scott: Right.

903
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:51,816
Scott: I didn't even bother to mention, you know, the default credit card benefits of getting miles or points or whatever the fuck, you know, because those are really insignificant.

904
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:52,157
Scott: Right.

905
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:53,523
Scott: Like I get cash back.

906
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:54,829
Scott: It's barely any cash back.

907
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:57,559
Scott: It's like a few hundred a year, but it's more than nothing.

908
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,021
Scott: Yeah.

909
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,194
Scott: I mean, you know, it's you know, the whole miles and stuff.

910
00:43:01,254 --> 00:43:02,138
Scott: It is a big scam.

911
00:43:02,158 --> 00:43:03,484
Scott: You're getting almost no points.

912
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:05,051
Scott: You know, it's such a small fraction.

913
00:43:05,132 --> 00:43:07,240
Scott: Also, when you're trying it's more than zero.

914
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:08,445
Scott: It's free stuff.

915
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:12,767
Rym: When you're traveling overseas, using your credit card gets you the best exchange rate of the day.

916
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:13,390
Scott: That's right.

917
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,645
Scott: You don't have to worry about hunting around the different exchange rate places.

918
00:43:16,665 --> 00:43:19,158
Rym: Some crappy credit cards have fees, but mine don't sell.

919
00:43:19,218 --> 00:43:19,922
Scott: Yeah, mine doesn't either.

920
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:25,547
Scott: So, yeah, you should use a credit card for absolutely everything and you should buy as much as you possibly can.

921
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,222
Scott: That's, you know, at least durable goods that are going to get stolen online.

922
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:31,090
Scott: So you have records automatically.

923
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:33,457
Scott: Alright, here's some more advice.

924
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:42,629
Scott: If you have expensive things, right, like Xboxes and TVs or whatever, you know, there's not really much you can do to like secure your house.

925
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:48,252
Scott: Even if you're crazy with a bunch of locks and stuff, anyone can break into your house if they really want to.

926
00:43:48,312 --> 00:43:55,722
Scott: I can go to Home Depot and buy like a saw that'll drill a hole in your door and put my arm right through and open your door from the inside with my hand.

927
00:43:56,023 --> 00:43:57,811
Rym: That's when the auto shotgun takes you out.

928
00:43:58,293 --> 00:43:59,396
Scott: If you got one.

929
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:00,019
Scott: And the dags.

930
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:01,624
Scott: If you got them, right.

931
00:44:02,427 --> 00:44:08,170
Scott: But if you don't got those, right, no number of like even, you know, the strongest, craziest locks is going to save you.

932
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:14,176
Scott: They're those dudes who open bank vaults with their ear, right, and a few tools, you know, in a matter of minutes, right?

933
00:44:14,197 --> 00:44:17,594
Scott: So nothing you can do to your house is going to keep someone out who really wants to get in.

934
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:21,408
Scott: As the locksmith said, locks keep honest people honest, right?

935
00:44:21,428 --> 00:44:22,674
Scott: That's pretty much all they do.

936
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:23,800
Rym: They also keep hobos out.

937
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,871
Scott: They keep hobos out and they keep stupid people out.

938
00:44:25,891 --> 00:44:27,963
Scott: But they're not going to keep a determined burglar out.

939
00:44:28,104 --> 00:44:28,325
Scott: Right.

940
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:31,219
Rym: If you have something really good, of course, in your case, it was just crowbar.

941
00:44:31,581 --> 00:44:32,665
Scott: It was just crowbar.

942
00:44:32,746 --> 00:44:32,967
Scott: Right.

943
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:37,387
Scott: But, you know, that's not to say that a crowbar defense mechanism would have actually sufficed.

944
00:44:37,448 --> 00:44:38,472
Scott: You know, they might have gotten in.

945
00:44:38,814 --> 00:44:42,872
Scott: There were any of 100 other ways to get in climbing up to the balcony, breaking the glass.

946
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:43,193
Scott: Right.

947
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:47,164
Scott: But anyway, what can you do to actually help out?

948
00:44:47,224 --> 00:44:51,119
Scott: Well, if I had like a camera, it actually probably would have helped.

949
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,249
Scott: It wouldn't help keep them out or save my stuff.

950
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:55,399
Scott: But the person would probably be in jail now.

951
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:55,942
Scott: Right.

952
00:44:56,243 --> 00:45:02,552
Scott: So getting one of those like babysitting, if you're really worried about it, you know, it's pretty cheap to get a webcam and a little recording thing.

953
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:09,638
Scott: And, you know, it's like, OK, it could actually prove useful in many other cases, even when it's not burglars.

954
00:45:09,698 --> 00:45:09,859
Scott: Right.

955
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:15,260
Scott: You can make sure that, like, the superintendent isn't watching TV in your apartment on the off days, if you care.

956
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:18,130
Scott: Or you can if you have friends over for a party.

957
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:18,612
Rym: Yes.

958
00:45:18,874 --> 00:45:21,308
Rym: In the apartment black box where you just, you know, you have your cameras.

959
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:24,405
Scott: You're going to catch like some YouTube moments that are going to be totally awesome.

960
00:45:24,727 --> 00:45:32,365
Rym: Or they'll just they'll catch, you know, the last 48 hours and then you have to go back and say, like, keep whatever's good, because then you could even hook it up to a motion detector.

961
00:45:32,385 --> 00:45:33,811
Scott: So only records when there's motion.

962
00:45:33,892 --> 00:45:38,309
Rym: But then if anything weird happens, either good, bad or awesome, you've got a record.

963
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:40,220
Rym: I've thought about setting up something like that in our apartment.

964
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:40,482
Rym: Yeah.

965
00:45:40,502 --> 00:45:49,665
Rym: I mean, it's what we don't have anymore, because James, who is like the best photographer in the group, at least in terms of being good at taking pictures of everyone, actually using the camera.

966
00:45:49,726 --> 00:45:49,947
Rym: Yeah.

967
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:51,032
Rym: It's still in Texas.

968
00:45:51,272 --> 00:45:55,267
Scott: Well, you know, it's not like, you know, what's his name comes over enough.

969
00:45:55,608 --> 00:45:59,483
Rym: So we don't have enough photos of us hanging out in parties.

970
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,652
Rym: We've had cameras just filming the whole apartment all the time.

971
00:46:01,953 --> 00:46:03,217
Scott: What's what's tall?

972
00:46:03,237 --> 00:46:03,759
Scott: John's name.

973
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:04,581
Rym: John.

974
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:05,424
Scott: No, no.

975
00:46:05,745 --> 00:46:06,628
Scott: You know, John.

976
00:46:06,688 --> 00:46:07,431
Scott: Who lives with Yuka.

977
00:46:07,451 --> 00:46:08,917
Scott: What's John's last name?

978
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:11,005
Rym: I don't know anyone's last names.

979
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:13,213
Scott: The tall guy who lives with John Kelly.

980
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:13,735
Scott: John Kelly.

981
00:46:13,755 --> 00:46:14,157
Scott: God damn it.

982
00:46:14,257 --> 00:46:14,518
Scott: Yes.

983
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:18,051
Scott: I was like, John, a tall John who takes photos all the time.

984
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:19,034
Rym: You're like, what's tall?

985
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:19,757
Rym: John's name?

986
00:46:19,797 --> 00:46:20,419
Rym: I'm like, tall.

987
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:22,626
Rym: John Kelly.

988
00:46:23,008 --> 00:46:26,104
Scott: He's the only other person who actually takes photos, but he really knows what he's doing.

989
00:46:26,124 --> 00:46:26,405
Scott: Yeah.

990
00:46:26,446 --> 00:46:29,182
Rym: He took a really good picture of me in that linen suit anyway.

991
00:46:29,222 --> 00:46:33,666
Scott: So don't if you're if you're worried about sending up a camera because you feel paranoid about it, don't feel paranoid.

992
00:46:33,706 --> 00:46:34,209
Scott: It's totally.

993
00:46:34,229 --> 00:46:34,691
Scott: why not?

994
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:36,099
Scott: You know, just one is all you need.

995
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:41,370
Rym: I was really that's one of the DIY projects I was thinking about doing is rigging cameras around the apartment that I'm going to use for parties.

996
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:45,849
Scott: You should get some like if my computer was stolen, it's not really a big deal.

997
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:46,090
Scott: Right.

998
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,035
Scott: And they didn't take them.

999
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:52,280
Scott: But if they did, it's not that big a deal because all my important stuff is in the cloud and on USB sticks and stuff like that.

1000
00:46:52,401 --> 00:46:53,104
Scott: And my laptop.

1001
00:46:53,164 --> 00:46:53,585
Scott: I'm good.

1002
00:46:53,866 --> 00:46:54,127
Scott: Right.

1003
00:46:54,168 --> 00:46:57,382
Scott: I got SSH keys, even though the private keys are on the computer.

1004
00:46:57,723 --> 00:46:59,110
Scott: They need a password to unlock the key.

1005
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,214
Scott: So it's not doing them any good.

1006
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:00,897
Scott: All right.

1007
00:47:01,278 --> 00:47:07,081
Scott: But I do have a lot of media MP3s on the hard drives and I have to redownload them if it was stolen.

1008
00:47:07,483 --> 00:47:11,563
Scott: So if you're worried about that, external hard drives, hide them somewhere under a bed or some shit like that.

1009
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:16,281
Scott: You know, I'm probably going to get one just mostly because I'm going to hook it up to the camera.

1010
00:47:16,843 --> 00:47:32,039
Rym: Actually, as a kid, especially in high school, not that it ever was necessary or helped me out in any way, but I always kept a tiny flash drive or back then, even like way back floppies with whatever, you know, whatever I thought would be important or incriminating or whatever.

1011
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,349
Rym: And I hit it in the cold air return.

1012
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,730
Rym: I think those floppies might still be there because I didn't take them when we moved.

1013
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,295
Scott: Another advice, right?

1014
00:47:39,335 --> 00:47:46,794
Scott: Those, you know, those Kensington locks, those little like basically the thing that lets you hook up a steel cable to your computer to tie it down to the desk or the furniture or whatever.

1015
00:47:47,256 --> 00:47:50,130
Scott: They're pretty much useless because some we just do as a clipper of any kind.

1016
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,896
Scott: You can cut right through that cable, no problem.

1017
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:58,701
Scott: But if you had enough of them, right, it might slow down or deter, you know, a robber.

1018
00:47:58,741 --> 00:48:09,085
Scott: Like if your Xbox was tied to the TV and was tied to the Wii and was tied to a computer and was wrapped around like a like a like a steam pipe or something like that, they're probably just going to go, fuck it.

1019
00:48:09,226 --> 00:48:10,332
Scott: You know, they didn't bring a clipper.

1020
00:48:10,352 --> 00:48:11,158
Scott: They brought a crowbar.

1021
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:12,065
Scott: So what the fuck are they going to get?

1022
00:48:12,085 --> 00:48:12,630
Rym: You got to watch out.

1023
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,648
Rym: I remember learning this from a cop friend when I was a kid because my dad's a fireman.

1024
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:21,025
Rym: So thieves who fail or run into difficulty might start breaking.

1025
00:48:21,085 --> 00:48:22,611
Rym: We'll just trash the place before they go.

1026
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:23,053
Scott: Yep.

1027
00:48:23,394 --> 00:48:26,403
Scott: That is also quite a possibility that they will just break stuff.

1028
00:48:26,544 --> 00:48:29,854
Scott: But in some ways, breaking stuff is good and bad.

1029
00:48:29,914 --> 00:48:30,035
Scott: Right.

1030
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:31,681
Scott: Insurance still covers breaking stuff.

1031
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:32,504
Scott: Right.

1032
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,323
Scott: But breaking stuff is almost more annoying because you have a bigger cleanup.

1033
00:48:36,403 --> 00:48:37,871
Scott: I had almost no cleanup because they didn't.

1034
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:43,368
Scott: They just took stuff cleanly, you know, but they also the cops.

1035
00:48:43,449 --> 00:48:43,629
Scott: Right.

1036
00:48:43,669 --> 00:48:45,217
Scott: They were like, God, did they drink a soda?

1037
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:46,142
Scott: Did they do anything?

1038
00:48:46,242 --> 00:48:49,440
Scott: You know, because that's how they can find DNA evidence and fingerprint evidence.

1039
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:54,263
Scott: A lot of people apparently are really stupid and like, they drink a glass of water or they sit down and watch the game.

1040
00:48:54,283 --> 00:48:56,071
Scott: I mean, you've seen it on YouTube, right?

1041
00:48:56,112 --> 00:48:58,845
Scott: All these people, they robbed someplace and they stopped to play Wii bowling.

1042
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:01,780
Rym: My favorite is the story about the guy who was locked.

1043
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:02,141
Scott: Yeah.

1044
00:49:02,161 --> 00:49:09,473
Scott: There was just a story about a guy today who got because he robbed the place and he we bowled for an hour and got caught and he went to jail for X time.

1045
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:09,653
Scott: Right.

1046
00:49:09,673 --> 00:49:10,857
Scott: He just got sentenced recently.

1047
00:49:12,562 --> 00:49:14,669
Scott: So, yeah, you know, watch out for stuff like that.

1048
00:49:16,352 --> 00:49:22,490
Rym: Of course, you can't go too far because I remember there's an episode of Dragnet when I was a kid and it was this like fancy clothing store that got knocked off.

1049
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:28,778
Rym: And the dragnet guys like, all right, we're going to help you deal with thieves to make it more difficult for thieves to get you in the future.

1050
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:33,438
Rym: And he goes to the rack of clothes and they're all racked on hangers facing the same way.

1051
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:37,393
Rym: And he's like, look how easy it is for a thief to grab all these clothes.

1052
00:49:37,694 --> 00:49:43,539
Rym: You should alternate all your hangers and make it really annoying for the customers to make it really impossible.

1053
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:43,821
Scott: Yeah.

1054
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:44,885
Scott: Notice how I haven't.

1055
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:48,442
Scott: I haven't suggested you do anything that actually makes your life inconvenient.

1056
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:48,784
Scott: Right.

1057
00:49:48,844 --> 00:49:57,687
Scott: I mean, tying all your stuff down with cables basically cost you some bucks and you do it once and then you just leave it that way because you don't move your stuff around that much over the TV.

1058
00:49:57,727 --> 00:50:01,106
Rym: Like, I didn't set it up, but I have some anchors for my TV because it's a big TV.

1059
00:50:01,146 --> 00:50:06,913
Rym: If it's on a stand, you can basically anchor it to the wall so that if someone bumps into it, there's no way they can knock it over.

1060
00:50:07,013 --> 00:50:11,754
Scott: That's a good idea, because TV falling over is perhaps infinitely more likely than it being robbed.

1061
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:14,647
Scott: And if one device can stop both of those, that's a good device.

1062
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:16,978
Rym: I bumped into my TV once and there's this moment.

1063
00:50:17,038 --> 00:50:17,641
Rym: It wobbled.

1064
00:50:17,822 --> 00:50:18,264
Rym: It wobbled.

1065
00:50:18,284 --> 00:50:19,691
Rym: I was worried the stand was going to break.

1066
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:22,719
Rym: I just stared at it like, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

1067
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,203
Rym: Oh, OK.

1068
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:25,747
Rym: Yeah.

1069
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:30,389
Scott: But yeah, you know, any you know, adding more locks to your door does make your life more inconvenient.

1070
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:30,510
Scott: Right.

1071
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:34,069
Scott: Now, you've got to get all these different keys and unlock them all and lock as a pain in the ass.

1072
00:50:34,571 --> 00:50:39,209
Scott: But having a camera in your house that is just there, you set it up once and that's it.

1073
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:41,180
Scott: It just doesn't bother you in your life at all.

1074
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,809
Scott: Maybe you get some sex tapes out of it.

1075
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:43,673
Scott: You know, it could be good times.

1076
00:50:44,516 --> 00:51:01,290
Scott: I mean, other than that, I mean, really, you know, if you show up at your house, you come home and it's burgled, don't touch stuff, especially if it looks like it doesn't belong to you, because the evidence people are going to want to be grabbing that before you grab that and just call the police immediately and chill, you know, just do whatever they say.

1077
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:01,932
Scott: All right.

1078
00:51:02,173 --> 00:51:02,535
Scott: That's it.

1079
00:51:02,736 --> 00:51:05,266
Scott: It's not really, you know, could have been worse.

1080
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:06,492
Scott: Maybe it would have been better.

1081
00:51:06,673 --> 00:51:09,811
Rym: Maybe it was one of those listeners who had your phone number and figured out where you lived.

1082
00:51:09,872 --> 00:51:12,925
Scott: I mean, anyone on the Internet knows all that stuff.

1083
00:51:13,005 --> 00:51:13,186
Scott: Right.

1084
00:51:13,247 --> 00:51:16,160
Scott: And if it's someone on the Internet who knows me, who robbed me.

1085
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:16,722
Scott: Right.

1086
00:51:16,762 --> 00:51:17,305
Scott: They're a jerk.

1087
00:51:17,686 --> 00:51:20,539
Rym: Well, we were thinking because Adam, you know, we're waiting to see.

1088
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:27,911
Rym: It'd be funny if the guy had logged in again with your Xbox profile, because he was like, why don't I just message and be like, hey, man, I got the weed.

1089
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,516
Rym: You want to meet me to get it.

1090
00:51:30,258 --> 00:51:33,788
Rym: or hey, man, do you remember my credit card number?

1091
00:51:33,808 --> 00:51:36,961
Rym: You know, I'd ask you to buy that thing and just try to like stream along.

1092
00:51:37,383 --> 00:51:37,665
Scott: Yeah.

1093
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:41,645
Scott: I mean, my credit card number was stored in the Xbox, but you can't actually get it right.

1094
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:47,346
Scott: So you can buy stuff using the card that's for the Xbox like games and downloads or avatar shit.

1095
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:47,627
Scott: Yeah.

1096
00:51:47,748 --> 00:51:52,546
Scott: But you can't actually, you know, use my credit card to buy stuff on Amazon or whatever.

1097
00:51:52,606 --> 00:51:53,570
Scott: This does no help.

1098
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:55,760
Rym: Well, apparently they bought some shitty Xbox games.

1099
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,037
Scott: They bought two human and fight night something and two other crappy games.

1100
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:02,767
Scott: And then Microsoft gave my money back.

1101
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:03,409
Scott: So whatever.

1102
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:03,991
Scott: All right.

1103
00:52:04,051 --> 00:52:04,473
Scott: It's all good.

1104
00:52:04,493 --> 00:52:06,181
Scott: Nintendo wasn't much help.

1105
00:52:06,322 --> 00:52:08,251
Scott: I basically had to go get a new Wii before they'll help me.

1106
00:52:08,914 --> 00:52:09,597
Rym: So we've had.

1107
00:52:09,657 --> 00:52:12,993
Scott: But I mean, they couldn't really add any points to my Nintendo without my credit card.

1108
00:52:13,033 --> 00:52:17,277
Scott: What they could do, though, is spend the points that were already on there, which I had some points.

1109
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:20,188
Scott: So they're going to buy a virtual console game.

1110
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:20,670
Scott: I didn't want.

1111
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:24,504
Rym: So we've had Bargo, Bargo, Boggle, Boggle and Bargo, Bargo.

1112
00:52:24,685 --> 00:52:24,926
Scott: Yep.

1113
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:25,689
Scott: What's next?

1114
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:27,094
Scott: Bungle, Bungle, maybe Bugle.

1115
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:29,123
Scott: Well, there is an anime called the Bungle.

1116
00:52:29,404 --> 00:52:32,273
Rym: There's also which is a bungling bay.

1117
00:52:32,294 --> 00:52:32,334
Rym: OK.

1118
00:52:33,097 --> 00:52:34,261
Rym: You don't remember that game?

1119
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:34,602
Rym: No.

1120
00:52:34,723 --> 00:52:35,044
Rym: Really?

1121
00:52:35,225 --> 00:52:35,426
Rym: No.

1122
00:52:35,526 --> 00:52:36,530
Rym: You don't remember bungling day?

1123
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:36,991
Rym: No idea.

1124
00:52:37,232 --> 00:52:37,453
Rym: Wow.

1125
00:52:39,098 --> 00:52:41,365
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1126
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:46,564
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for Web Design and Brando Kay for the logos.

1127
00:52:46,765 --> 00:52:51,824

1128
00:52:52,065 --> 00:52:54,735
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1132
00:53:07,527 --> 00:53:10,471
Scott: But unlike those other shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1133
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:33,007
Scott: But you know, nowadays.

1134
00:53:33,027 --> 00:53:37,110
Scott: The old man got all the money.

1135
00:53:38,471 --> 00:53:42,050
Scott: And the young man ain't got nothing in the world.
