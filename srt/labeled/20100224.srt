1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,219
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 24th, I'm Rym.

2
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:13,820
Rym: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,930
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight for anime Phantom Thief Reina Durara, Chuuuubraa, and Cobra.

4
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:23,928
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:33,404
Rym: So Emily and I are trying to get some food at the desire like we do often But we happen to get it together like during the day.

6
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:35,315
Rym: like normal day We end up getting lunch.

7
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:36,178
Scott: No snap.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,156
Rym: And normally, you know, nothing weird is gonna happen except Took stranger from a candy.

9
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:42,039
Rym: Stranger from a candy.

10
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,344
Scott: You took a stranger from a candy?

11
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:44,609
Rym: I took candy from a stranger.

12
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:46,256
Scott: Man, I wish there were free strangers.

13
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:47,923
Scott: Man, I would just fill my closet with them.

14
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:49,048
Scott: So useful.

15
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:53,870
Rym: See, Scott, the problem is there are plenty of free strangers, but if you fill your closet with them, the police usually come knocking.

16
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,290
Scott: Well, they do the same thing if you get the free candy, so it's a lose-lose.

17
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,927
Rym: We're sitting there and this guy comes up and he's very friendly and smiley and clean.

18
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:03,630
Rym: doesn't like nothing.

19
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:05,570
Rym: I'm not really getting any alarm bells from him.

20
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:10,352
Rym: I ignore most people, but he says like Many thanks.

21
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:11,135
Rym: Wonderful day.

22
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:16,149
Rym: Have a present from Saudi Arabia and he hands us this little packaged thing of like date candies.

23
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,960
Rym: Alright, and it looked really good because I really like dates.

24
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,010
Scott: I like dates also, especially if they are wrapped into bacon.

25
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:24,317
Rym: So we were kind of taking it back.

26
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:28,909
Rym: So we just took it like, alright, thanks We didn't really think about what we were gonna do with it.

27
00:01:29,594 --> 00:01:31,990
Rym: And then he went around and tried to give him to like everyone else in the restaurant.

28
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:36,472
Rym: He went over to like the chef and everything and then he put the box from down with the rest of the food like Out front.

29
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:38,200
Rym: I don't know if he got permission to do that or what.

30
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:44,259
Rym: and we're sitting there and we're like, alright We probably shouldn't eat this being Candy from a stranger.

31
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,089
Rym: That's like the first thing you learn not to eat.

32
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:48,179
Rym: Like don't go in the van with no windows.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,927
Rym: Don't take candy from guys.

34
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:50,410
Rym: You don't know.

35
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,803
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know Seinfeld talks about the Danish.

36
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:53,850
Scott: you're walking through a hotel.

37
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:56,160
Scott: You see a tray sitting on the floor outside a room.

38
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:57,125
Scott: Someone got room service.

39
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,170
Scott: is a Danish sitting there?

40
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,175
Scott: Maybe it's half-eaten.

41
00:01:59,416 --> 00:01:59,678
Scott: Right?

42
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,643
Scott: Well half-eaten.

43
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,045
Rym: I don't know.

44
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,050
Rym: I don't want a hepatitis That's true.

45
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:06,379
Scott: But I mean you could eat the half that you know The part that they didn't bite into right.

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,049
Rym: but if it's on eaten if like say there's just a Danish untouched on a plate There's nothing wrong with that?

47
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:17,955
Rym: What are the odds that someone went around and point it poisoned a Danish that was just laying there or took a Danish that I'm gonna Poison this and leave it out.

48
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:21,530
Scott: Yeah, they wanted to poison a random person as opposed to a specific person.

49
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:34,350
Scott: I mean if it was the only chance The best chance of it being poisoned was if there is like a high-profile person that you know In the room that someone was actively trying to poison and that high-profile person did not eat the day.

50
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,903
Rym: No you realize Scott we have increased the odds that we will die by poison Danish.

51
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:40,997
Rym: because if someone really wanted to get us and we're Really famous someday, right?

52
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:41,902
Rym: I'll figure out.

53
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:43,150
Rym: you know, we're at Otakon or Pat.

54
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,950
Scott: If someone would have done that to Seinfeld already who was already famous.

55
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:49,461
Rym: Yeah, but he's so famous that he probably doesn't encounter.

56
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:51,468
Rym: Danish is in the wild too, right?

57
00:02:51,508 --> 00:02:52,110
Scott: He's so famous.

58
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,798
Scott: He travels and goes to so many hotels.

59
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:55,004
Scott: He definitely encounters.

60
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:55,526
Scott: It depends.

61
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:56,350
Rym: Does he have an entourage?

62
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,192
Rym: I don't think he has a big entourage because as much as you know, I'm the kind of person if I find a Danish I'll just eat it.

63
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:07,331
Rym: But if I if I was big enough to have an entourage, I wouldn't even think Oh a Danish I'll eat that.

64
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:12,542
Rym: I think Oh a Danish entourage get me a Danish not that one entourage.

65
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:14,626
Scott: taste that Danish for me.

66
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:17,958
Scott: I See you have not dead.

67
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,522
Scott: Thank you.

68
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:19,769
Scott: Give me the rest of the Danish.

69
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,215
Rym: But you know, I'm on.

70
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:24,930
Scott: I'm on the same page as you know, that's my strategy if there's ever some fugu.

71
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:26,697
Scott: Actually, I read an article recently.

72
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:32,429
Scott: They said that they say some fishery in Japan Bread some fugu with no poison in them.

73
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:36,469
Rym: But from what I've read you want a tiny bit of the poison because your tongue is supposed to go numb.

74
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:39,321
Scott: Well, you know the point is is that it's not gonna kill you.

75
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:44,324
Scott: But the point the thing is is that You know people were like, oh, it's not the real deal.

76
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:45,670
Scott: then I'm like, what are you talking about?

77
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,250
Scott: I would totally eat that one as opposed to the poison one.

78
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:55,629
Scott: But on the other hand whether it was poison or not poison I would not eat a fugu unless I saw someone else in the restaurant eating it before me.

79
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:56,630
Rym: But what do you know?

80
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,470
Rym: What if they cut two different fugu and the first guy got the skilled hands of the skilled chef?

81
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,447
Rym: And for the second guy the skilled hands were busy?

82
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,598
Scott: Then that's just the luck of you at the food dress tries.

83
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:09,824
Scott: then you're already eating mr.

84
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:10,286
Rym: Scott.

85
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:13,633
Rym: You may have been Poisoned.

86
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,830
Scott: well, that's that's a risk you take with this sort of thing.

87
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,322
Scott: But at least the risk will be much lower.

88
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:22,443
Scott: if you know I'm eating a non poisoned fugu and I saw someone else eat it first.

89
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:23,988
Rym: or you know, the random Danish.

90
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:27,180
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I'm still I'm on the same page as Jerry.

91
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,915
Rym: if someone went through all the trouble to poison that random Danish You know what?

92
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:30,562
Rym: They got me.

93
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:39,181
Rym: Yeah so the guy then kind of sits down next to us and is watching us like waiting for us to eat it and We just kind of sit there and he's like, it's good and we're like.

94
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:40,247
Rym: and then you know Emily's like.

95
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,715
Rym: hey, yeah You know, I'm kind of full.

96
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:46,196
Rym: so maybe you should give this to someone else, you know in case I don't get a chance to eat he's like no, no, it's very good take eat.

97
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,008
Rym: and we kind of waited awkwardly until eventually he wandered away and We threw the thing away.

98
00:04:53,790 --> 00:05:00,446
Rym: Yeah, and I'm not a paranoid person I mean I'm assuming that this guy was just trying to be really friendly and he just had.

99
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,550
Scott: but why in that?

100
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,382
Scott: Particular restaurant at that particular time with that particular food and why?

101
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,047
Scott: why present it in that particular way?

102
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:07,910
Scott: what you know?

103
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:13,050
Scott: The fact that he didn't explain himself like he could have explained it is a gift from Saudi Arabia.

104
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:20,622
Scott: No, he could have explained like, you know, look like for example, let's say I made some cookies, right and I All right.

105
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:29,969
Rym: I see where you're going But if someone made cookies or brownies or something and was giving them out for free I would probably take them because I would assume the worst thing anyone does is something like that is put pot in him.

106
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,890
Rym: In fact, I think the I mean, you know random cookie having pot in it are high.

107
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:45,918
Scott: Just the circumstances were so strange that you didn't know what to think He could have explained in detail like look I made these cookies Right or it's a holiday something something.

108
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,686
Scott: explain the tradition of the holidays explain a bit.

109
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,130
Rym: It is a gift from Saudi.

110
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,616
Scott: That's not an explanation.

111
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,804
Scott: an explanation involves many details.

112
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:55,210
Scott: Why did you make the cookies?

113
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,684
Scott: Why are you giving them out in this particular restaurant at this particular time?

114
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:00,010
Scott: Why these particular cookies?

115
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,896
Scott: What you know, who are you?

116
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:05,830
Scott: why you know, they provided all these reasons and they were reasonable.

117
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,257
Scott: I would have been like, oh it makes sense.

118
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,690
Scott: All right, you know, for example, it's a special holiday.

119
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:22,750
Scott: You're so everyone's supposed to bake these cookies and give them out to people and it's a special Treat to eat this cookie on this special day, you know, so I'm going to every restaurant and the whole street I work in the next building over giving out the cookies.

120
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,659
Scott: It's like oh now it makes perfect sense.

121
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:26,910
Scott: And now it is reasonable and you're no longer a crazy person.

122
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:30,200
Rym: So I figured there are three ways to react to the situation.

123
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,350
Rym: on the one extreme is eat it because you don't fear nothing.

124
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,520
Scott: It probably wasn't poison probably not the.

125
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:40,379
Rym: the opposite side of that is call the police Right then and there and punch.

126
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,646
Scott: the guy didn't do anything illegal.

127
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,654
Rym: Yeah, I know But in case.

128
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:51,270
Rym: so I took the pragmatic rational approach, I did not eat the stranger candy But while he was walking out, I just took a picture of him with my phone surreptitiously.

129
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:58,540
Rym: So on the tiny chance that in the news the next day I saw mass poisoning in New York City Date candies in this eye.

130
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,909
Rym: I can be like got you guy.

131
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:02,772
Rym: That's all I got.

132
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:04,978
Rym: that was the weirdest thing that happened to me in the last 24 hours.

133
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:08,311
Scott: Alright.

134
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:11,090
Scott: so I guess we're doing some geek.

135
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:16,930
Rym: It's been what forever since Wednesday episodes just got the shaft for like the last couple months.

136
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,921
Rym: Yeah, I mean we keep.

137
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:24,170
Rym: we had this weird schedule, you know We're doing whatever shows we can fit in as we're getting the studio back up and everything and then stuff.

138
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,037
Rym: She kept coming up on Wednesdays Like we go out to some event.

139
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:29,488
Rym: it didn't happen and for it until real.

140
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,000
Rym: recently We weren't watching that much anime either.

141
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,990
Scott: Well, I was watching animes.

142
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,910
Scott: But you know, I've actually watched a lot of animes, but you haven't been watching them.

143
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:47,150
Rym: Also, I've been watching a ton of anime recently just now But we started watching anime right as we stopped doing Wednesday shows for completely unrelated reasons.

144
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:53,556
Rym: But before that when we were doing Wednesday shows we were watching anime except you were watching fist of the North Star And I was watching boat arms.

145
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,360
Scott: Mm-hmm.

146
00:07:54,963 --> 00:08:01,132
Rym: So I'm watching boat arms All right and fist of the North Star Okay.

147
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:01,594
Scott: Yeah.

148
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:02,920
Scott: Yeah, how about that?

149
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:04,970
Rym: Is there any anime you particularly want to talk about?

150
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:12,098
Scott: Well, you know, I did watch all of the original space battles of Yamato all the episodes.

151
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:20,210
Scott: I have to say that You know when it comes to the space battles of Yamato you can tell that it is an early work of.

152
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:22,316
Rym: You forgot his name.

153
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,447
Rym: You're stalling for time.

154
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,737
Rym: that whole time You were gonna say his name right away.

155
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:29,670
Scott: Actually, no, I was IMing someone on Meebo on my iPhone.

156
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,100
Scott: So I was that my brain was having to work double.

157
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,188
Rym: Were you perhaps IMing Daryl Surratt to ask him?

158
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:35,275
Rym: No It's name.

159
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:46,163
Rym: I know it's Leiji Matsumori But anyway, the I've only ever experienced Space battleship Yamato through Katsu singing the opening theme at karaoke.

160
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:46,323
Scott: Yeah.

161
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:47,688
Scott: Well, that's that's the opening theme.

162
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,995
Rym: Yeah Does it?

163
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:51,448
Rym: does it live up to the opening theme?

164
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,459
Scott: I mean the thing with the show is it's like.

165
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:04,379
Scott: it's not like the best show in the world, but it's all It's doing so well here because it's hard to explain.

166
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,242
Scott: it's like the show.

167
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:07,590
Scott: it doesn't have strong characters.

168
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:11,475
Scott: the characters are very flat and Like stereotypical.

169
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:12,639
Scott: it's like, you know, the road.

170
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,710
Scott: the doctor drunken doctor is the drunken doctor from beginning to end.

171
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:19,089
Scott: You know the captain is the captain from beginning to end.

172
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:25,683
Scott: You know, the main character is the the guy who wants to Shoot it up, you know all the time.

173
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:27,129
Scott: He's shootin up again.

174
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,930
Scott: Yep, so and people don't really change from the beginning of the show to the end.

175
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:42,108
Rym: so is it a show more of Kind of like the way a lot of people who like comic books like American superhero comic books like them you care about the series Of events and what actually happens?

176
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,247
Rym: Mmm, like the procedural well the ship went here and this is the war and this is the politics.

177
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,719
Rym: and this is the war and Politics.

178
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:49,306
Rym: and here's the plot.

179
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:57,090
Scott: now It's basically every episode though The overarching plot is actually a really high quality very sort of revolutionary for its time story.

180
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:00,984
Scott: Right of you know, oh my god, the earth is gonna die.

181
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:02,410
Scott: It's getting destroyed by aliens.

182
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:06,321
Scott: The only hope the earth has of not of not being destroyed.

183
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:19,369
Scott: Is it this one the only spaceship they have left Going all the way across the galaxy out to another galaxy Getting this space cleaner technology from some other aliens and coming back to earth within a year?

184
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,416
Scott: That's the only hope of earth.

185
00:10:21,757 --> 00:10:25,550
Scott: So it really builds the suspense for every time the ship isn't gonna make it.

186
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:31,257
Scott: It's not just oh the ship isn't gonna make it like you're watching Gundam seed if the ship's gonna get blown up or the Gundam Is getting it blown up.

187
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:38,150
Scott: It's like, okay, it'll get blown up But in this it's like if the ship gets blown up as the does effectively the same as earth being destroyed.

188
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:44,797
Rym: You know, it's kind of the same deal with Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles the whole like, yeah If you don't come back a whole bunch of people get screwed.

189
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:52,380
Scott: Yeah, so you basically every episode is like, oh my god The Yamato is gonna get destroyed because of eggs.

190
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:53,083
Rym: Oh great.

191
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:54,006
Rym: So it's Ava syndrome.

192
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,290
Rym: Oh, they're not gonna make it.

193
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,794
Rym: Oh, they made it.

194
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:57,308
Rym: No, they're not gonna they made it.

195
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:02,890
Scott: Yeah The thing is they get they get hurt pretty bad quite often and this is one episode that you know.

196
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,670
Scott: You watch it and it's like so many things happen in the episode.

197
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,857
Scott: It's like ridiculous.

198
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:16,890
Scott: and then it like the fan subs I watch are really good and they had all these notes and the credits that told you stuff and like just the amount of production That it wasn't even the last episode.

199
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,930
Scott: It was the episode with the gigantic space battle where they fought like the four or five different colored space fleets all at once.

200
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:24,436
Scott: And it was just like you.

201
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:34,202
Scott: I thought you may I read the note at the end about how much Production went into that one episode and I thought back of all the stuff that happened in it I was like, wow, that was some fucking feat for the time.

202
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:34,724
Scott: It was made.

203
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:35,306
Scott: Holy shit.

204
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:36,350
Rym: I gotta watch it.

205
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,270
Rym: I mean, I just started a while ago on Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

206
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:41,333
Scott: Great.

207
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:48,090
Rym: Yeah, because you know captain Tyler is such a great show and it's clear the homage in Tyler to other shows like this.

208
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:51,741
Rym: So I feel like I really need to watch all of all the shows that Tyler was.

209
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:52,383
Rym: Oh margin.

210
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:58,423
Rym: Mmm, maybe but anyway If you are being a being what we are anime, you know panels and things.

211
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,370
Rym: we have to have seen this show.

212
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:01,509
Rym: So I figure I'll watch it.

213
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:02,454
Scott: Yeah I'm gonna.

214
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:09,190
Scott: I'm gonna probably watch eventually, you know The other Yamato's that were made at later points in time and are probably much more advanced, you know.

215
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:18,125
Scott: I mean because most of the flaws in Yamato are not fundamental flaws They're just sort of craftsmanship flaws because it was so early in the career of Matsumoto.

216
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:19,930
Scott: He didn't yet build up his full powers.

217
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,910
Scott: It's like reading in one of those really old Tezuka mangas, you know, not everything Tezuka did is gold.

218
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,890
Scott: I love it is ambassador magma exact, you know, if you read some like really early Tezuka manga it kind of sucks.

219
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:33,370
Scott: You know, he wasn't that good from the beginning.

220
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:46,194
Scott: I'm not saying I don't want people to think that I'm saying that the space battles of Yamato sucks Which is not what I'm saying, but it's got animation mistakes, you know, I'll put it this character is a very flat You know, it's these sort of.

221
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:49,550
Scott: but the overall it's you know, it's better than the vast majority.

222
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,550
Scott: I feel like we're obligated is very historically significant.

223
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:59,421
Rym: We're obligated to treat any anime regardless if it's new or old Or not on the scale that we've been using personally forever the.

224
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:01,267
Rym: is it an anime of be anime?

225
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:10,293
Rym: what so independent of the historical importance of this show and the importance to the culture of this show and the importance to his career of This show?

226
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:12,889
Rym: is it an anime be anime?

227
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:19,530
Scott: I guess it depends on the mood you're in, you know, like, you know certain episodes of the show would be like.

228
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:27,538
Scott: You know B or B plus and other episodes are like it could get towards a. you know, you know overall It's in the B plus a minus area.

229
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,643
Scott: I would say.

230
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:29,145
Scott: All right.

231
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,230
Rym: I feel like I should watch it then.

232
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:38,820
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's only 20 episodes and then you know It opens up to you the ability to watch all the rest of the series which you know, very in quality I guess.

233
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:40,836
Scott: I assume You know, they can't.

234
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:44,815
Rym: you know see the trouble I have more and more and I really really have to fight These urges.

235
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,097
Rym: is that?

236
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:46,430
Rym: well that sounded kind of bad.

237
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:58,266
Rym: Anyway, whenever I start to watch a show that I haven't seen before especially if it's not one that I already know a lot about Like I know it's a good show or it's come to me with very specific recommendations or anything like that.

238
00:13:58,286 --> 00:14:00,910
Rym: I Keep getting distracted by shows.

239
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:15,510
Rym: I've already seen that other people I know have not seen that I feel obligated to watch again with them like the first episode like Oh, you should watch this and we watch the first episode together and then I remember oh, yeah This show was like one of the best shows I've ever seen in my life and end up watching the whole show again.

240
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:22,630
Rym: Yep, like ghost in the shell standalone complex Emily and I this is God my third watching through of it at this point.

241
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,310
Rym: And we're right at the point at the end where oh shit everything happens.

242
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:31,090
Rym: And all I can think is I want nothing more than more ghost in the shell.

243
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:34,686
Rym: No other anime could do it for me right now than more ghost in the shell.

244
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:40,222
Scott: I Could take more things more bebop except that really wouldn't work.

245
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:40,924
Scott: That doesn't work.

246
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:42,568
Rym: more Ava there is more.

247
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:43,915
Scott: Ava There is.

248
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:46,090
Scott: I haven't seen all those weird extra things.

249
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,570
Rym: I could use another escaflowne, but there are some shows like goon saga that I think could fill that niche.

250
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,154
Scott: Yeah, I got a watch.

251
00:14:52,214 --> 00:14:53,097
Scott: I only why I watched.

252
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:55,787
Scott: I started watching through the goon saga and then I stopped.

253
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:57,193
Scott: it's like I should Have kept watching that.

254
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:57,915
Scott: what is wrong with me?

255
00:14:58,217 --> 00:14:59,602
Rym: Yeah, LuPone.

256
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:01,308
Rym: I feel like I could always watch more LuPone.

257
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:02,433
Rym: for some reason We just don't.

258
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:05,103
Scott: I can just watch more Satoshi khan anything.

259
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:06,710
Rym: Yeah, but there isn't any yet that we do.

260
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,261
Rym: I'm on Miyazaki anything.

261
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:09,329
Rym: Oh my god.

262
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:14,382
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but some more Gundams that are actually Gundam seed quality.

263
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:17,410
Rym: Yeah, or or old Gundam OAV quality.

264
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:23,869
Scott: That's true, it's more war in the pocket some more quality Gundams as opposed to you know, Gundam see destiny Gundams.

265
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:26,289
Rym: I feel like I should.

266
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:28,817
Rym: There was no Gundam see destiny.

267
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:29,440
Rym: What are you talking about?

268
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,650
Rym: That was like some sequel made by someone else.

269
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,894
Rym: It wasn't actually Gundam.

270
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:33,355
Rym: It was gun.

271
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:33,977
Rym: Damn.

272
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:34,679
Scott: Uh-huh.

273
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,281
Rym: I don't know.

274
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:37,287
Rym: then like how there was only one matrix movie.

275
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:41,056
Rym: Yeah, sure But I am watching Botoms.

276
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:44,950
Rym: It starts out as a Gundam II kind of clone, but I know it goes somewhere different.

277
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:49,427
Rym: It I don't know what's doing it for me so far just feels like a B anime nothing special.

278
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:59,814
Rym: Mm-hmm Really all I'm watching right now until I finish ghost in the shell again And then I feel like I'm just gonna watch second gig and I'm just gonna keep watching ghost in the shell till I've seen it All again, I'm

279
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,669
Scott: still watching hokuto nuken on and off, you know, I watch it.

280
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,410
Scott: I watch a segment, you know until it gets you know, a plot point is dissolved.

281
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:07,356
Scott: I watch something else.

282
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,509
Scott: I come back to it, you know that sort of thing.

283
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,190
Rym: We kind of stopped watching Rosa Versailles feel like we should start that up again.

284
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:14,715
Scott: Yeah, but things are watching it.

285
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:18,550
Scott: The only reason I didn't watch more is because you know, we watched it together.

286
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,589
Rym: So yeah, so we got to start watching it together again.

287
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:25,143
Rym: We can't really double feature with hokuto nuken though, because I'm way behind.

288
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:28,231
Rym: I'm like 60 episodes behind you Mm-hmm.

289
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:32,347
Scott: Yeah, I'm on episode 90 something I think but the thing is it's like I'm episode 90.

290
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:37,440
Scott: I'm like, uh But it's like there's a hundred and forty fifty episodes.

291
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:39,546
Scott: So you gotta I got a ways to go still.

292
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:42,852
Rym: that's less than Sailor Moon That's true.

293
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:45,281
Rym: Yeah, I watched all of that in like two weekends.

294
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:46,364
Rym: Mm-hmm.

295
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:47,950
Rym: That's not gonna get repeated.

296
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:59,619
Rym: So things of the day.

297
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:03,136
Rym: Emily found this movie for me and she said it was right up my alley.

298
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:07,176
Rym: and after watching the trailer It is totally right up my alley and probably yours too.

299
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,915
Rym: The Secret of Kells is an Irish animated movie.

300
00:17:12,035 --> 00:17:13,319
Rym: it just watch the trailer.

301
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,232
Rym: It looks crazy awesome and it'll be in theaters pretty soon.

302
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,960
Rym: If you live in a real city, is that it?

303
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:18,967
Rym: That's all I got.

304
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:20,095
Rym: I mean the style.

305
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:24,334
Rym: at least in the trail You'll see the style is kind of unique and kind of flat and colorful.

306
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:26,000
Rym: I I really like everything about it.

307
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,039
Rym: I'm really looking forward to actually seeing this.

308
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:33,134
Scott: Alright, so this would be better on a science day, but whatever it's still awesome.

309
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:34,738
Rym: You're a cross-pollinating.

310
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:35,300
Scott: That's fun.

311
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:36,444
Scott: there's a guy here.

312
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:45,515
Scott: his name's Derek Lowe and he has a PhD in organic chemistry and Postdoc stuff and where he's a scientist.

313
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:46,079
Scott: He's real smart.

314
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:56,376
Scott: He's got this blog here and one of the categories on his blog is things I won't work with and every blog post talks about a chemical that he refuses to work with.

315
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:58,040
Rym: Oh like dimethylmercury.

316
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,693
Rym: Dimethylmercury, I know really that's not on there.

317
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:05,786
Scott: Well with that it's actually does it.

318
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:14,440
Scott: there is a A post about straight dimethyl zinc and in that in that post he says dimethylmercury.

319
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:18,931
Scott: I will not get within yards of However, the most recent post.

320
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:20,760
Scott: I'm gonna link to the whole blog.

321
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:29,846
Scott: you can just read through all the posts, but specifically the most recent post which talks about dioxygen difluoride and he actually talks about how.

322
00:18:29,926 --> 00:18:48,119
Scott: you know, okay at some point, you know, some guy made this stuff and 1962 and he did a basically did a bunch of tests, you know to see how it reacted with a bunch of different things and This guy was basically, you know Risking his life every single day.

323
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:50,879
Scott: And here is here is an excerpt, right?

324
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:56,186
Scott: Let's see the Where.

325
00:18:56,246 --> 00:19:06,080
Scott: some liquid what's it called di Di oxygen difluoride, so he has some liquid dioxygen difluoride.

326
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,550
Scott: He mixed it with some liquid ch4.

327
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,517
Scott: a violent explosion occurred.

328
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:14,129
Scott: now Let me read to you all of the of the words.

329
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:30,819
Scott: when point two milliliters of liquid You know di oxygen difluoride was added to point five milliliters of liquid ch4 at 90 degrees Kelvin a violent explosion occurred.

330
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:47,597
Scott: So basically this shit right causes crazy explosions and crazy fires Even at basically almost zero temperatures there being a high-energy oxidizer Dioxygen difluoride reacted vigorously with organic compounds even at temperatures close to his melting point.

331
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:54,304
Scott: it reacted Instantaneously with solid ethyl alcohol producing blue flame and an explosion And an explosion.

332
00:19:54,324 --> 00:20:02,540
Scott: when a drop was added to liquid methane cooled at 90 degrees Kelvin a white flame was produced instantaneously Which turned green upon further burning?

333
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,520
Scott: So this is basically dangerous, holy shit gonna explode stuff.

334
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,544
Rym: Well, here's the question.

335
00:20:09,564 --> 00:20:11,111
Scott: guy will not work with it.

336
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:13,280
Rym: Is it used for anything useful?

337
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,000
Rym: I mean, I forget what chemical I was reading about on Wikipedia the art of them, but okay the final paragraph.

338
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,708
Scott: So does anyone use dioxygen difluoride for anything?

339
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:32,139
Scott: not as far as I can see most of the recent work with the stuff has come from groups at Los Alamos where it's been used to prepare national security substances such as plutonium and Neptunium hexafluoride.

340
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:39,609
Scott: But I do know that if you run the structure through sci-finder it comes out with a most Unexpected icon that indicates a commercial supplier.

341
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:42,680
Scott: That would be the hung so sage chemical company.

342
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:46,380
Scott: They offer it in hundred gram 500 gram and one kilo amounts.

343
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,420
Scott: Whoa, which is interesting because I don't think a kilo of dioxygen difluoride has ever existed.

344
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:54,273
Scott: Someone should call them on this.

345
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:59,234
Scott: as for free shipping If they object tell them Amazon offers it on this item.

346
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:08,649
Scott: serve some right more But this whole blog is full of this sort of awesomeness about crazy crazy Chemicals that this guy refuses to work with.

347
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:14,488
Rym: that was one career path that I gave up on very early when I realized I hated Doing chemistry and I hated naphthalene.

348
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,171
Scott: Hmm.

349
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:16,556
Rym: I was cool with chemistry.

350
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:19,089
Rym: It was all like oh math I can figure out what's going on with math.

351
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:27,812
Rym: and then when Argo happened I had to sit in that stupid lab with the fume hood and every single reaction was take naphthalene And turn it into something that smelled horrible and stained your hands.

352
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:28,414
Rym: Mmm.

353
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:30,000
Rym: and after like a month of that I gave up.

354
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,463
Rym: I was done.

355
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:39,131
Scott: He also won't work with as it As a dough tetrazzolate salts or your mom.

356
00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:40,093
Scott: that's true.

357
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:42,699
Scott: my mom doesn't know chemistry.

358
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:51,180
Rym: so So we actually holy shit watched a whole bunch of anime we hadn't watched before to kind of preview it.

359
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:51,885
Rym: Yeah, we're going.

360
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:53,820
Scott: we're going back to old-school GeekNights.

361
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,060
Scott: We watched like a handful of episodes of a handful of animes.

362
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:01,280
Scott: We didn't finish watching any of the shows and we're just gonna talk about what we watch.

363
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,180
Rym: So two of the shows involve bras, so should we start with or end with the two bra shows?

364
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,406
Scott: Let's let's do the bras first.

365
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:08,787
Rym: All right.

366
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:12,480
Scott: Oh, I think all the shows have a raw right if I'm correct.

367
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,605
Rym: What one is a yeah.

368
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:14,549
Scott: Oh, yeah.

369
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:14,669
Scott: Okay.

370
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:15,252
Scott: They all ended.

371
00:22:15,754 --> 00:22:17,240
Scott: Ah, so chew bra.

372
00:22:18,143 --> 00:22:21,416
Rym: I don't know if any of you have actually looked into this show

373
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:22,400
Scott: in this infamous

374
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:35,620
Rym: horror, all I want to say is that it's the kind of show to where if you describe to someone what it's about and They're an anime fan their first thought will be you're just making fun of people who like moe shows that show doesn't really exist.

375
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:45,280
Rym: this show exists Exactly in the way that you think it is so real and so exactly what we expected that it was kind of horrifying.

376
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:46,409
Rym: It was like a train wreck.

377
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:47,539
Rym: We couldn't look away.

378
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:50,048
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, let's see.

379
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,399
Scott: Let's there has to be something good to say about the show.

380
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:58,838
Scott: It's not a straight-up hentai, but in many ways a straight-up hentai would be better says.

381
00:22:58,898 --> 00:23:05,686
Rym: secondly Well, it would be better because if you were watching a straight-up hentai you at least have to have admitted to yourself that yes I am watching porn.

382
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:07,232
Rym: I'm watching this to arouse my guess.

383
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,360
Scott: I guess this is 12 episodes, right?

384
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:15,420
Scott: So somebody spent 12 Episodes worth of money on this that they could have spent on like one episode of Ghost in the Shell, which is fucked up.

385
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:16,505
Scott: Ah, right.

386
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:21,405
Scott: I guess you know, it's it's animated Averagely for a modern show.

387
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:33,265
Scott: It's not like bad animation, you know, they put some work into it And there are a couple Humorous moments, you know, it's like ha ha ha Involve the bras.

388
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:38,260
Rym: No, they involve the duck and the turtle exactly as far as I can tell have no reason to be.

389
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,760
Scott: It's just like love Hina right where there's a turtle in the show and the turtles just sort of funny and cute.

390
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:44,730
Scott: But the turtle really doesn't mean anything in the show.

391
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,916
Scott: It doesn't really do anything.

392
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:46,983
Scott: It's just there It's.

393
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:49,240
Scott: there's ever the one episode where the turtle matters.

394
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:54,695
Scott: So in this show, there's like a turtle and a duck and this other animal and the animal are just.

395
00:23:54,755 --> 00:24:04,827
Rym: they're just funny animals Weird cutaway where the ducks just like in the pool being super pissed off and it just cuts to that and then cuts away With no explanation.

396
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:07,660
Scott: Yeah, and that's pretty much they should have just made.

397
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,898
Scott: They should have spent all their money on making the turtle duck and cat show and ignored the other stuff.

398
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:27,600
Scott: Basically Chubra is a show If you don't know this already right where it's about a girl in middle school and She wears non middle school underwear.

399
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:28,062
Scott: She's like.

400
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:31,899
Scott: she wears grown-up underwear because she's an underwear tester and she is an underwear fan.

401
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,920
Scott: Like she knows all the details about underwear the way initial D knows all about cars, right?

402
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,133
Scott: So and the other girls at school?

403
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:42,600
Scott: their underwear is no good.

404
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,011
Scott: Their underwear is too small or it's not, you know comfortable or whatever.

405
00:24:46,372 --> 00:24:54,740
Scott: and she starts an underwear club and helps everyone out with their Underwear, but meanwhile everybody thinks that she's like, you know, I got a sugar daddy or you know.

406
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,001
Scott: They don't.

407
00:24:55,182 --> 00:24:56,166
Scott: they don't think it's legit.

408
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:59,160
Scott: They think that you know, she's obviously, you know a slut or something.

409
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:05,179
Scott: So they spread all these rumors about her and whatever when really she has this perfectly legitimate underwear fan ism.

410
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:24,753
Rym: however, however It's hard to what we'll start with the opener because the opener and the closer are this weird mix between panty shots and breast shots and Like Imagery of flowers blooming and plants.

411
00:25:25,154 --> 00:25:26,500
Rym: It's all just really creepy.

412
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:36,499
Scott: Basically, it's just another one of those moe shows where they show you all sorts of T&A But they put in you know a run-of-the-mill.

413
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:48,340
Scott: You know cookie cutter plot of school drama, right, you know making friends at school Starting a club and being interested in something and teaching you about it.

414
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,963
Scott: You're like a car.

415
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:49,887
Scott: no go teaches you about.

416
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:50,229
Scott: go.

417
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,319
Scott: this show teaches about underwear same thing.

418
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:54,853
Rym: So it does but it's so forced.

419
00:25:54,913 --> 00:25:56,019
Rym: it's really weird to watch it.

420
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:05,350
Scott: Well, yeah And all that all the cookie cutter stuff is there so that the pervert watching it can use that as an excuse to say No, I'm you know the same way playboy.

421
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,080
Scott: Oh, I'm reading the playboy for the articles.

422
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,480
Rym: I'm watching this to learn about girls underwear or because I think it's cute like the people who watch bingo town.

423
00:26:12,601 --> 00:26:14,640
Scott: Yes, but really it's just perverted.

424
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:20,020
Rym: It's literally butt shot butt shot butt shot penny shot and then oh a quick random aside.

425
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:22,399
Rym: This kind of underwear is called this.

426
00:26:24,865 --> 00:26:27,176
Scott: And here's some more T&A of middle school girls.

427
00:26:27,196 --> 00:26:27,840
Scott: you pedo.

428
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,689
Rym: The first episode is called the girl who wore adult panties.

429
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:33,759
Rym: the second episode this swelling chest.

430
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:41,159
Rym: Yeah, a windy day between an adult and a kid radical puberty.

431
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:49,257
Scott: So if you are a Pedophile perv I've got the show for you.

432
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:50,782
Scott: Yeah well and you could.

433
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:52,609
Scott: the great thing about this is you wear pedo.

434
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:58,010
Scott: you can just make an excuse about watching the show cuz it's Totally legitimate school drama.

435
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:04,460
Rym: one thing I can say about the show though while you're watching it And I've seen this with other similar like crap moe shows.

436
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:05,422
Rym: they'll.

437
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:12,430
Rym: whatever is going on on the screen the music that is playing in the background is Really really really inappropriate.

438
00:27:12,953 --> 00:27:14,480
Rym: like there's this dumb goonie scene.

439
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,729
Rym: We're like one girl's trying to take a picture of the other girls panties to prove that she's wearing adult underwear But then she falls.

440
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:25,840
Rym: so another girl tries to save her But then the girl is in underwear tries to save both of them and it's like goonie and they're all gonna fall.

441
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,682
Rym: It's all weird But the whole time in the background is playing kind of the same music that you hear in the background of two girls one Cup.

442
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:34,279
Scott: there is only one good thing that can come out of the show.

443
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:47,660
Scott: I don't know if it will actually ever occur But it is the only good thing possible that can occur from this show And that would be if some girls who are over the age of 18 would cosplay as to bra and have revealing sexy underwears.

444
00:27:48,026 --> 00:27:48,738
Scott: That would be nice.

445
00:27:49,464 --> 00:27:51,859
Scott: Anything else has to do with the show not good?

446
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:52,422
Rym: I love.

447
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:58,445
Rym: the opener song to its credit was similar to the opener to PETA 10 Which is kind of.

448
00:27:58,465 --> 00:28:02,120
Scott: it's just one of those high-energy data data data data data song.

449
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,399
Rym: I kind of forgot that I actually do like music like that.

450
00:28:04,923 --> 00:28:06,673
Rym: When I'm in the right mood you got to be in the right mood.

451
00:28:06,773 --> 00:28:07,900
Scott: It's just a catchy tune.

452
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,330
Scott: It's not you know, it's not something I like or actively listen to.

453
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,314
Scott: it's just sort of catchy.

454
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:12,820
Rym: Yeah, I just catchy.

455
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:21,548
Rym: I mean no one remembers PETA 10 but it was for some reason pretty popular like when we were at the anime club at RIT and It's a very short amount of time.

456
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:25,088
Rym: It's weird that both of us kind of independently were like, yeah That's kind of like the PETA 10 opener.

457
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,760
Rym: I never even watched PETA 10.

458
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,020
Rym: I watched one episode of PETA 10 on the first game on the first day of middle school.

459
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,682
Rym: You have middle school.

460
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:32,305
Rym: you perverts.

461
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:36,540
Rym: Naya Hamia accidentally shows her black lace panties during the opening ceremony.

462
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,084
Scott: I think we've talked too much about true bra.

463
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:38,987
Scott: Let's talk about cobra.

464
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:43,380
Rym: Cobra is about an adult man who wears brought up.

465
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,360
Scott: Yeah, so so basically the story with Cobra right is that there was this old anime space adventure.

466
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,693
Rym: We're talking if this anime was on TV in Japan when I was zero.

467
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:59,235
Scott: Yeah, so two years ago They made an OAV which was a remake of the original space adventure Cobra.

468
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:09,480
Scott: and then one year ago They made an OAV that was a sequel to the remake and this year They made a TV show that was a sequel to the sequel to the remake.

469
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:21,199
Rym: so if you want to know what kind of show this is the opening scene of the first episode is basically guys in a truck that looks like a shark being chased by people in a helicopter that looks like a pterodactyl and

470
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,619
Scott: then they go into a tunnel and are chased by sort of flying cubes and

471
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:28,346
Rym: My favorite part is that.

472
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:49,059
Rym: so like the the good guys with some sort of you know MacGuffin are in this land shark trying to get away and they're driving in the tunnel and the pterodactyl goes up and then there's this giant gun battle and the main character gets introduced and all this craziness and The people with all these like attack robots and guns and power suits and the pterodactyl robot book.

473
00:29:49,980 --> 00:30:02,234
Scott: Immediately when the local cops show up It's like you know, they're chasing down like the galaxy patrol and then the highway patrol shows up Which is just a bunch of like, you know, like, you know middle-of-nowhere desert cops.

474
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:07,712
Scott: and you know, like paddy wagons Shit the highway patrol and they run away highway patrol comes out.

475
00:30:07,732 --> 00:30:10,585
Rym: They're like, oh it looks like there was an accident There.

476
00:30:12,863 --> 00:30:14,179
Scott: It's like, you know, great good great.

477
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,755
Rym: So Cobra is kind of like a cross between Lupin and riding bean and Wolverine.

478
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:23,730
Scott: Yeah, he's got the powers of Wolverine You know, he can regenerate.

479
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:24,720
Scott: he's near invincible.

480
00:30:25,142 --> 00:30:25,766
Rym: That's instead of.

481
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:29,831
Scott: instead of claws instead of six claws He has one gun.

482
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:31,160
Scott: one of his arms is a gun.

483
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,908
Scott: He basically takes his hand off which is otherwise a normal hand and under there is a gun and it's not just any gun It's the psycho gun and he shoots in it.

484
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:39,229
Scott: Basically.

485
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:42,420
Scott: It's ultra powerful gun that seems to have infinite ammo.

486
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:48,500
Rym: Yep, so he's Wolverine and he's kind of a badass and he's kind of a jerk, but he also talks.

487
00:30:48,621 --> 00:31:06,964
Scott: He's like, you know, he's super dangerous But he talks a lot like spider-man as opposed to gogo 13 who says that that that And There's all sorts of ladies with giant boobs and he has to deal with them and survive and also Get ladies.

488
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:10,840
Rym: I think the most important part of the show is that he always has a cigar in his mouth.

489
00:31:11,322 --> 00:31:13,412
Scott: Yeah, it's just always there as an accessory.

490
00:31:13,452 --> 00:31:14,256
Scott: Like it's not late.

491
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:16,445
Scott: He's not smoking it It's just in his mouth all the time.

492
00:31:17,128 --> 00:31:20,540
Scott: Just you know, whether when he's talking it just sort of wiggles around all over the place.

493
00:31:21,086 --> 00:31:29,449
Rym: Everything about this show is dumb like it's it's kind of like watching an old bubblegum crisis or something where if you watch it in the in certain mindsets you think This is just dumb.

494
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:35,191
Rym: everything about this is dumb But the action is pretty good and it kind of it.

495
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,020
Rym: it scratched an itch that I didn't realize I had.

496
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,407
Scott: Yeah, I didn't think about.

497
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:44,774
Scott: you know, I'm not like going out to watch more of it But like if it was on I'd be like, all right, you know, it's it's fine.

498
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:46,602
Scott: You know, it's not like abhorrent It's just.

499
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,052
Scott: it's not like so exciting.

500
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:51,789
Scott: I need to go watch it, but it is Sort of silly, you know, it's silly.

501
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,113
Scott: It's got action.

502
00:31:53,455 --> 00:32:01,700
Scott: The animation is decent enough You know, I think the one problem the show lacked is that there really wasn't a really good hook.

503
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:03,615
Scott: You know, it's like the character.

504
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:06,865
Scott: he's cool but he's not like so awesome that it's like.

505
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:11,932
Scott: I'll you know that I got to watch it no matter what he does and The plot was basically like.

506
00:32:11,952 --> 00:32:13,120
Scott: you have this golden key.

507
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:17,477
Scott: You needed to stop this at comment from crashing into the Sun and destroying earth.

508
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,645
Scott: and it's like well There's really no mystery here.

509
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:21,130
Scott: Is there I don't really care.

510
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:26,743
Scott: You know, he's obviously gonna save the earth so Whatever.

511
00:32:26,884 --> 00:32:29,031
Rym: Yeah, but it's just like it's dumb goonie comedic action.

512
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:29,433
Rym: It's kind of.

513
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:31,520
Rym: it's got a lot of the Lupin kind of stuff.

514
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:39,469
Rym: He makes Lupin II kind of noises like go on he ducks under things But he's a little more You know rough than Lupin.

515
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:48,340
Rym: Lupin is more, you know, he's like red Lupin But times two he kind of reminds me as the main guy in Kazanoyo Jimbo, which was a pretty mediocre show.

516
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:55,120
Rym: But that guy was the kind of consummate like he was a badass, but he acted like an idiot most of the time.

517
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:59,675
Rym: Master Keaton had that a little bit too, except this guy's nothing like master Keaton.

518
00:32:59,715 --> 00:33:00,760
Scott: master Keaton was a nice guy.

519
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,483
Scott: This guy's jerk.

520
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,908
Rym: Well master Keaton was a master.

521
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:04,334
Rym: This guy's clearly a professional.

522
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:04,756
Scott: I don't know.

523
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:05,720
Scott: He's a professional either.

524
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:13,219
Rym: He's a pirate but he hates the pirate guild, but he also hates the space patrol But he hates the pirate guild more than the space patrol.

525
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:28,628
Rym: It's funny how the show about middle schoolers had breasts and bras But the breasts were relatively small But not as they should be but cobra the animation which has as far as I can tell almost no bras Has some of the most accepted name.

526
00:33:28,828 --> 00:33:30,695
Rym: Brock enormous jubilees.

527
00:33:30,715 --> 00:33:37,660
Rym: you will see an anime to date I mean the one bad guy main girl character is pushing naga the serpent levels.

528
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:38,544
Scott: You can't hang these.

529
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:40,354
Scott: all of them were like double naga the serpent.

530
00:33:40,374 --> 00:33:41,360
Scott: What are you talking about?

531
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:46,538
Rym: Not quite double because double is It doesn't matter there are way.

532
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:53,000
Scott: Every female like gigantic gigantic knockers, you know, I know and the guy is totally, you know a womanizer.

533
00:33:53,143 --> 00:34:04,291
Scott: of course like he was he was on a stretcher gonna go to the hospital before they knew he had healing powers and He's like, I don't wanna go to the hospital cuz you know, he knew he didn't need to go there But they thought he did and they're like, you know, that's hot nurses there.

534
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:06,520
Scott: He's like, oh, I'm totally going to the hospital.

535
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:13,900
Rym: It's kind of I just call it another dumb actiony romp But the action is pretty good and I could see myself watching it every now and then when I was bored.

536
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,947
Scott: Yeah, nice nice be be show.

537
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:21,759
Rym: Yeah, it's hard to say if it's a high B or a low B. It really depends on whether or not it is.

538
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:27,556
Rym: I don't know if it takes itself seriously toward the end or not because if it pulls the kind of slayers II.

539
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:30,391
Rym: it doesn't take Itself seriously and everything just goes crazy.

540
00:34:30,974 --> 00:34:33,003
Rym: It's a lot more awesome More serious.

541
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:35,070
Rym: it takes itself is gonna be really really dumb.

542
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:42,580
Rym: unless it takes itself so seriously that it comes good It becomes a meta non serious show that takes itself seriously.

543
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:47,980
Rym: Mmm, I'm trying to think of an example of a show like that because I know I've seen things that take themselves.

544
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:55,340
Rym: You know what giant robo takes itself so dead seriously, but is so stupid that it kind of balances out.

545
00:34:55,801 --> 00:35:01,520
Rym: Maybe I don't know if the show can balance it out, but pterodactyl robot basically raping that land shark.

546
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:03,005
Rym: I think it's got some potential.

547
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:03,527
Scott: Yeah.

548
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,009
Scott: Yeah.

549
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:08,757
Scott: All right, the other show we watched Oh What's it called?

550
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,757
Rym: Phantom thief Raina, this is another one of those like tiny five-minute episodes.

551
00:35:13,797 --> 00:35:14,922
Scott: Yeah, you know We like.

552
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:16,690
Scott: we like those shows that are really short.

553
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:22,399
Scott: We're actually doing a panel on short animes Like fur Akapa and

554
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,590
Rym: Ryoku sagi

555
00:35:25,852 --> 00:35:39,112
Scott: all these, you know We like the animes where the episodes are like a minute or two long and this is another one of those And it's phantom thief Raina and the animation is sort of like Wario where you know If you ever played a Wario where game and the jokes

556
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:40,698
Rym: are the same jokes, basically - yeah

557
00:35:41,561 --> 00:35:55,100
Scott: and basically the story is there's a girl she works in a convenience store, but she's also a phantom thief and there's like a detective who's out to get her and Like the detectives assistant likes is in love with the convenience store girl.

558
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:55,803
Scott: And they don't know.

559
00:35:55,863 --> 00:36:02,009
Scott: the convenience store girl is the phantom thief obviously and every night She goes out to steal things that are awesome.

560
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:03,053
Scott: Usually gold things.

561
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:05,120
Scott: It's like she steals like the with the gold potato.

562
00:36:05,301 --> 00:36:12,852
Rym: I think the more operative part here is that she's kind of a bitch Kind of yeah, and mostly she's a bitch to her sidekick.

563
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:15,900
Scott: cute animal the rat basically the whole episode, right?

564
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,407
Scott: You'll the episode will be all about.

565
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:18,713
Scott: you know, I'm gonna go steal this thing.

566
00:36:18,734 --> 00:36:21,078
Scott: Oh, I'm in the convenience store I'm gonna steal this thing.

567
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,553
Scott: How am I gonna steal this thing?

568
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:23,179
Scott: No, no, no, no.

569
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:31,296
Scott: But meanwhile the whole time every time the rat will show up and say something like, you know Oh, you're lazy and then she'll like smack the rat and then it escalates.

570
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:37,865
Scott: She basically murders Yeah, and then the rat will come back from being smacked and he'll be like, you know Are you gonna steal that way?

571
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:45,887
Scott: you stealing that for you should get a real job and then she'll like put a bottle rocket in his butt and you know It's like just basically it's show.

572
00:36:46,229 --> 00:36:47,252
Scott: hurt the rat show.

573
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,195
Scott: hurt the rat show.

574
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:48,877
Scott: hurt the rat show.

575
00:36:48,897 --> 00:36:49,800
Scott: hurt the rat show.

576
00:36:50,262 --> 00:36:53,480
Rym: Hurt the rat shows over is it's on the page and then you're at the right exactly page.

577
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:59,700
Scott: So it's basically half the show is just torturing this rat and half the show is you know, Phantom thief Raina.

578
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,231
Scott: She works at the convenience store and she steals things and there's detectives.

579
00:37:03,532 --> 00:37:04,335
Rym: I get the impression.

580
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:17,863
Rym: I feel like every like segment of it like every distinct portion of the show is Doing some sort of a mod or parody to some older show because they like they keep cutting to these weird like asides or things Within their.

581
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:21,520
Rym: you know, I I don't even want to say there's a plot because there basically isn't a plot.

582
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:26,092
Scott: Yeah, we watch two episodes and if there's a plot it moves way slow.

583
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:29,260
Scott: it's mostly like the reveal one plot aspect per episode.

584
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:34,101
Rym: It's pretty much just a bunch of puns and weird kind of jokes and I don't know It's.

585
00:37:34,746 --> 00:37:36,600
Rym: it's if you want to kill like a minute.

586
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:41,194
Scott: It's basically like a knock-knock joke, you know of phantom thieving.

587
00:37:41,214 --> 00:37:46,677
Rym: Yeah sadly I don't have any use for the show other than to use it as an example of short anime.

588
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,340
Rym: to show one episode.

589
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:50,273
Scott: It's not as good as like, you know, I can.

590
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:51,599
Scott: I feel like manga BRE.

591
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:56,371
Rym: I feel like I'm gonna show this like at near the beginning of the bite-sized anime panel.

592
00:37:56,391 --> 00:37:58,418
Rym: cuz you got to show the kind of meh shows like.

593
00:37:58,438 --> 00:38:06,360
Rym: you got a Hit with one really good short show Like gag manga and then do a bunch of like, okay ones and some bad ones and then hit again at the end.

594
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,954
Rym: It was like three awesome ones in a row.

595
00:38:07,974 --> 00:38:08,458
Rym: Mm-hmm.

596
00:38:08,841 --> 00:38:17,177
Scott: Oh my god, like chew bra is like the nut is like, you know The show that is like currently like the head, you know the header on crunchyroll on the front page.

597
00:38:17,278 --> 00:38:19,226
Rym: Oh my god Look, this is crunchyroll.com.

598
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:21,436
Scott: chew bra is like the top show here.

599
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:24,606
Scott: Ah That's that's fucked up right there.

600
00:38:24,726 --> 00:38:28,900
Rym: See I I really want to know cuz who's watching this in America?

601
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:32,029
Rym: I understand that the the perverted money depend.

602
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:32,992
Rym: Yeah, we did.

603
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:33,695
Rym: we did watch it.

604
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:35,239
Scott: Here's my theory on this.

605
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:36,366
Scott: now You ready for this theory?

606
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:36,870
Scott: I'm ready.

607
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:38,160
Scott: Okay, so here's my theory.

608
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:43,994
Scott: You could make a show like say one piece or Pokemon right where you're gonna.

609
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:53,880
Scott: it's gonna be so ludicrously popular that everyone in the universe is gonna watch it right and You know everyone it's gonna sell so big.

610
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,029
Scott: you're gonna have Pokemon toothbrushes and Pokemon.

611
00:38:56,049 --> 00:39:04,317
Scott: this and Pokemon and Pokemon everything right and Therefore right and all those merchandise and all the DVDs and everything is.

612
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:10,520
Scott: and you get so much Advertising dollars and you're gonna have such, you know, you're gonna have reasonable margins on all these products, right?

613
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,955
Scott: You're gonna make a ton of money if you want to make an anime that is not going.

614
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:17,944
Scott: you know already It's not going to be Pokemon.

615
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:19,027
Scott: It's not gonna be Dragon Ball.

616
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:23,940
Scott: It's not gonna be super popular across a zillion kids everywhere, right?

617
00:39:25,403 --> 00:39:27,259
Scott: If you make say ghost in the shell, right?

618
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:30,933
Scott: You're not really gonna sell that much merchandise.

619
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,760
Scott: You're not gonna sell that many advertisements.

620
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:35,069
Scott: You're not gonna get big sales numbers.

621
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:37,840
Rym: That's why I think standalone complex was pay-per-view in Japan.

622
00:39:38,102 --> 00:39:40,240
Scott: Yeah, you're not gonna get the big numbers on it.

623
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,211
Scott: So right without the big numbers.

624
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:46,444
Scott: if you want to make money you have to have big margins Right.

625
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:49,740
Scott: and for big margins, that means the show can't be a kids show.

626
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,148
Scott: It has to be a show for people with money.

627
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:57,100
Scott: and the thing is when it comes to merchandise Even if some guy in Japan is like a you know, it's like a 30 year old business guy.

628
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,706
Scott: You might like ghost in the shell.

629
00:39:58,987 --> 00:39:59,689
Scott: You might watch it.

630
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:03,823
Scott: He's never gonna buy ghost in the shell action figure Or a t-shirt.

631
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:09,380
Scott: or you know, maybe he'll buy a manga but that's you know, he's not gonna buy any of that other stuff.

632
00:40:09,745 --> 00:40:10,759
Scott: He's not gonna buy the DVDs.

633
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:12,820
Rym: So so clearly what's going on here?

634
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,295
Rym: Is that chew bra is going to sell bras to perverted 30 year old men?

635
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:22,579
Scott: when you make something like chew bra you can get it might even be a smaller audience than ghost in the shell.

636
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:39,820
Scott: and But all of the merchandise and such these otakus who watch it Actually shell out money for action figures and posters and Such in models and and and and uh, and you can mark those things up with high margins.

637
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,600
Scott: You can sell them a plastic tchotchke for 50 bucks.

638
00:40:43,101 --> 00:40:55,953
Scott: So if you want to make money on an anime your two options are either become so popular that you can have reasonable margins on your products and make a big bank or You have to actually target your.

639
00:40:56,114 --> 00:41:05,404
Scott: if you're not gonna be popular You at least have to be popular among a segment of people that will shell out dough for stuff at high margins So you can make your bank.

640
00:41:05,444 --> 00:41:11,705
Scott: and I think this actually is parallels in the US comic book industry where it's like, okay You know, we've sort of given up.

641
00:41:11,745 --> 00:41:16,420
Scott: There's no way we're gonna get it zillion people to actually buy spider-man comic books, right?

642
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:25,638
Scott: So if we the only reason to make spider-man comic books is first we jack up the margin on them right to four dollars an issue or whatever they charge these days.

643
00:41:25,658 --> 00:41:38,739
Scott: and Then you know we have to make bank by selling like a spider-man statue for 50 bucks and a spider-man t-shirt for 20 bucks and only you know For the nerds will buy it all up and we'll be able to make money on them, you know.

644
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:58,039
Scott: But I think the thing is with something like spider-man They've actually achieved the double the double-deuce in which they have spider-man movie or spider-man cartoon And you know, which is wicked popular and sells a zillion across the board and then they also Have the low quantity high margin at the same time.

645
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:01,139
Rym: That's probably the Holy Grail but you brah not getting there.

646
00:42:01,574 --> 00:42:02,417
Scott: No So juke, you know.

647
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:19,777
Scott: That's why I think the moe shows have been making the bank because the otaku in Japan will buy high-margin products But the shows that would appeal to a smaller mark to us equal size Maybe even larger size audience, you know a ghost in the shell type of show, right?

648
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:26,248
Scott: That audience is not an audience that will buy high-margin Merchandise extra crap at all.

649
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:29,040
Scott: All they will do is watch the show and you can't make money off of them.

650
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:35,286
Rym: Therefore you only you can with things like, you know in Japan unlike in America It's on TV ads.

651
00:42:35,426 --> 00:42:38,958
Scott: all you know, all these shows are only on at 3 a.m So there's the ads.

652
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:39,640
Scott: don't make anything.

653
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:46,254
Scott: so you can really if you want to make money with anime your options are Miyazaki movie type of situation.

654
00:42:46,474 --> 00:42:52,566
Scott: right one piece kind of situation or The chubra situation.

655
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:55,560
Rym: Scott, how do you think that all these shows like Dora on everything right now?

656
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,950
Rym: How are they gonna make their money?

657
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:57,880
Rym: They're not gonna sell the merch.

658
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,191
Scott: I don't think they make that much money, but they make money.

659
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,080
Scott: I don't know if they make money or not.

660
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,165
Scott: I think they're sort of my.

661
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:04,591
Scott: so you think they're on the edge.

662
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:07,282
Rym: you think that pretty much every show that comes out is Unprofitable.

663
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:08,184
Scott: I don't know.

664
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:09,387
Scott: I don't know but it can't be.

665
00:43:09,448 --> 00:43:09,789
Scott: it's not.

666
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:12,195
Scott: it's not excessively profitable.

667
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:12,657
Scott: They're not.

668
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:13,840
Scott: you won't convince me.

669
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,834
Scott: You're saying the Dora is making mad bank.

670
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:16,720
Scott: Is that what you're saying?

671
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:17,503
Rym: I'm saying that.

672
00:43:17,784 --> 00:43:20,615
Scott: are you gonna say that Dora makes more bank than chubra?

673
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:22,040
Rym: I'm saying I don't know.

674
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,640
Rym: I just think your picture of the way the only ways to make revenue is a little bit.

675
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,645
Scott: I'm saying the only way.

676
00:43:26,806 --> 00:43:30,627
Scott: I'm saying the only ways to make Bank, you know I mean you might you can't.

677
00:43:30,728 --> 00:43:33,040
Rym: you basically can't make bank with anything.

678
00:43:33,684 --> 00:43:35,313
Scott: I think you brought nothing makes bank.

679
00:43:35,334 --> 00:43:36,400
Rym: you bro is not gonna make bank.

680
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,520
Scott: I think you brought makes a scare and it's not making one piece back, but I think it's making scary Bank.

681
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:43,149
Rym: I highly doubt that.

682
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:45,160
Rym: actually I don't think it's gonna make that much money.

683
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,600
Rym: I don't think nearly as much as you expect.

684
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:47,633
Scott: I think it's gonna make more.

685
00:43:47,694 --> 00:43:52,353
Rym: in Durara Cuz perverted 30 year old guy can only buy so many pairs of underwear.

686
00:43:52,634 --> 00:43:54,560
Scott: You can buy a lot more than three-year-old kid.

687
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,260
Scott: Anyway, so why don't we talk about that Durara?

688
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,851
Rym: So Dora is our second Narita show.

689
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:05,927
Rym: we got baka no first, which is freaking awesome Even though I didn't watch the last two episodes yet.

690
00:44:06,048 --> 00:44:08,699
Scott: I didn't why I've watched about maybe ten episodes.

691
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:09,662
Scott: eight I'm not sure.

692
00:44:09,703 --> 00:44:10,244
Scott: I don't know.

693
00:44:10,305 --> 00:44:13,877
Scott: I'm gonna start over about solid b-plus a-minus anime.

694
00:44:13,957 --> 00:44:14,860
Rym: It's just awesome.

695
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:22,665
Scott: Yeah, but Durara the reason is called Durara is because that's an onomatopoeia for a motorcycle noise like dude Right.

696
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:31,615
Scott: and The show is basically about this kid who moves to Tokyo You know from the boonies sort of like Detroit Metal City except.

697
00:44:32,016 --> 00:44:38,760
Scott: He's not secretly metal He's just regular old kid, and he totally doesn't get you know, but what's going on, but he's got a friend.

698
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,300
Scott: He's totally city guy and his best friend.

699
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,100
Scott: So you see you know showing on the ropes how things go and as long as the interesting characters and happenings in the city.

700
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:55,117
Scott: But mostly there's this you know sort of urban legend of this motorcycle girl who's wicked dangerous, and who knows what she's up to.

701
00:44:56,179 --> 00:45:04,048
Scott: and What I think is so cool about it is that you know usually when you have an urban legend show It's always that cliche plot of.

702
00:45:04,429 --> 00:45:07,199
Scott: there's an urban legend spreading around and no one it doesn't.

703
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:11,495
Scott: you know There's no evidence of it being real, but then there's something that might be it.

704
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:11,696
Scott: No.

705
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:12,177
Scott: It's not it.

706
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:13,383
Scott: It might be it It's not it.

707
00:45:13,826 --> 00:45:14,289
Scott: I saw it.

708
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:14,953
Scott: I saw it.

709
00:45:15,034 --> 00:45:15,920
Scott: No one else saw it.

710
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:27,893
Scott: This is like everyone is standing on the side of the street and the motorcycle goes down the street and everyone sees it well It's like a real urban legend and everyone's like oh shit It does something that I like and a few other shows have done this before.

711
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:34,240
Rym: I'm not saying which ones because it kind of Depending on how this show goes and how you watch it it can actually spoil those shows.

712
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,240
Rym: But it's a show that presents a normal world except weird anime kind of stuff happens.

713
00:45:39,681 --> 00:45:46,579
Rym: But I get the impression that the weird the reason that this weird anime kind of stuff can happen is the plot of the show.

714
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,220
Rym: You think that is there's some sort of deal with this world.

715
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,300
Rym: I mean you know it's some punk kid who's you know he's never really lived anywhere except his parents house.

716
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:09,832
Rym: He goes to he goes to the big city, and there's just weird like effectively superheroes fighting like way in the distance And he sees like the explosions all the weird stuff happening far away and Everyone else in the city is like yeah, that's that's what happens here.

717
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:10,494
Rym: Well.

718
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:11,437
Rym: You don't know that's just.

719
00:46:11,457 --> 00:46:12,139
Rym: that's just how it is.

720
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:15,394
Scott: Yeah, the show also it has some pretty good characters in it.

721
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:16,901
Scott: You know the main character He.

722
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:19,194
Scott: you know he's kind of funny in his country bumpkin ways.

723
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,159
Scott: He's got something to him.

724
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:23,834
Scott: You know his best friend is kind of is really silly and has bad jokes.

725
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,448
Scott: the motorcycle girl Urban legend girls really intriguing.

726
00:46:27,508 --> 00:46:28,552
Rym: I like the Russian.

727
00:46:28,813 --> 00:46:30,600
Scott: the Russian sushi guy is the best.

728
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,026
Rym: Oh my god the black Russian.

729
00:46:32,046 --> 00:46:35,340
Rym: you see him, and you know it's a. it's a Naruto show.

730
00:46:35,702 --> 00:46:43,560
Rym: So there's a million million characters and all of them are really fleshed out or at least Iconic enough to where you know that they're all gonna have their moment with something crazy.

731
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,527
Scott: Yeah, it's like sad.

732
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:46,561
Scott: you know it's like snatch or one of those movies All these.

733
00:46:46,742 --> 00:46:50,740
Scott: it was just cast of awesome characters, and you know they actually do stuff.

734
00:46:50,861 --> 00:46:53,180
Rym: Yeah, that's kind of take snatch or bacchanal or Dora.

735
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:58,460
Rym: You just take a bunch of awesome characters put them in a bin go shake shake shake and throw them out and see what happens.

736
00:46:58,647 --> 00:47:00,104
Rym: Yep I love that.

737
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:11,299
Rym: so the action is good too like this the comedic timing of the of the I guess fight Which by the way the show gets points or someone using a motorcycle as a melee weapon and yeah, right?

738
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:19,923
Scott: Yeah, the other thing is that The show is interspersed with like showing you these instant message chat room like this IRC chat Weird cuz.

739
00:47:19,964 --> 00:47:23,920
Rym: it almost sounds like the same person is reading all the chats, but with a different like accent.

740
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:30,897
Scott: Yeah As opposed to the different people really reminds me of that second bayside shakedown movie where they had the IRC chats.

741
00:47:31,238 --> 00:47:34,254
Rym: Oh, yeah the Let's save the Rainbow Bridge.

742
00:47:34,295 --> 00:47:40,582
Scott: Yeah exactly There are some other things like it's in ghost in the shell has a little bit kind of you know well What's cool.

743
00:47:40,622 --> 00:47:51,240
Rym: one thing about this show that I get and the problem is this is the same kind of thing I said for paranoid Agent way back, but then when I asked Satoshi khan he was like that's really cool and interesting But that's not at all what I was thinking.

744
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:52,683
Rym: Look at the beginning.

745
00:47:52,703 --> 00:48:01,740
Rym: the country bumpkin comes and all the scenes show like every character in the background who isn't him is In black and white except for the people he knows like everyone's kind of just a shadow.

746
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,868
Rym: But the people that he interacts with are real.

747
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:07,060
Rym: it's kind of like the real world like living in the city.

748
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,960
Rym: There's all these weird and strange and cool things going on that you don't get if you're living somewhere rural.

749
00:48:11,707 --> 00:48:13,000
Rym: And yet then look at the plot.

750
00:48:13,502 --> 00:48:26,019
Rym: there's all these crazy things these superheroes these urban legends like the fights going on in the distance and the Explosions the motorcycle girl and all these things are just normal to all the people in the city But they're completely crazy to him who came from outside the city.

751
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:37,572
Rym: so I wonder if it that like they're taking that kind of metaphor of going from the old Farmville to the big city and like instantiating that metaphor Into the world on multiple levels.

752
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:49,394
Scott: I think also what's kind of cool about it Is that it simultaneously gives you that city environment where there's a lot of things happening a lot of energy a lot of people a lot Of excitement, but it also gives you that neighborhood feeling where it's like.

753
00:48:49,414 --> 00:48:52,288
Scott: he knows everyone in the neighborhood He knows all the places.

754
00:48:52,348 --> 00:48:54,180
Scott: he says hi to all sorts of people on the street.

755
00:48:54,602 --> 00:48:58,180
Scott: You know and it's it's kind of rare that you would have both of those things.

756
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:04,169
Scott: You know it's hard to it's hard to really like you know find You know walk down the street and like know everybody.

757
00:49:04,189 --> 00:49:07,140
Scott: you know or at least you know know someone in every block.

758
00:49:07,582 --> 00:49:11,096
Scott: You know personally you know in such a crowded crowded place.

759
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:17,480
Scott: You know and So that's that's pretty cool And it's almost just like fun to be in that city environment.

760
00:49:17,661 --> 00:49:18,105
Scott: And it's like.

761
00:49:18,427 --> 00:49:22,194
Scott: I hope that as you watch more episodes They just really flush it out, and it's sort of like whoo.

762
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:23,079
Scott: I'm in a fun place.

763
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:27,220
Rym: So I noticed something now really weird and you're gonna have to bear with me on this.

764
00:49:27,762 --> 00:49:31,738
Rym: I don't know if this just says a lot about me and the way I think so.

765
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:43,016
Rym: Baccano the first Narita show we got and Durara the second Narita show we got and the titles are in English here Right like I've got him like romanized in English mm-hmm Baccano.

766
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:51,618
Rym: Durara has one more character in it than Baccano and Baccano has one exclamation point, but Durara has two exclamation points.

767
00:49:53,181 --> 00:50:00,800
Rym: So I feel like the third Narita show whatever it may be is going to have nine characters in the title and three exclamation points.

768
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:05,772
Rym: All the data I have indicates that this is exactly what is going to happen.

769
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:06,554
Scott: Okay, whatever.

770
00:50:06,655 --> 00:50:08,240
Scott: Why don't you check the Japanese?

771
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:16,124
Rym: Titles well Baccano was just called Baccano, but there are two exclamation points here very specifically It is you know.

772
00:50:16,164 --> 00:50:17,950
Scott: the thing is you know Baccano.

773
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,294
Scott: I think they said what does it mean?

774
00:50:19,334 --> 00:50:21,040
Scott: it means like static or noise?

775
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:23,588
Scott: Yeah, and Durara is a noise.

776
00:50:23,628 --> 00:50:27,260
Scott: So it's like he's definitely doing going for the noisy titles.

777
00:50:27,722 --> 00:50:32,803
Scott: Yeah, the next show is probably like boom or Boom headshot.

778
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,069
Scott: Zoom bang or something along those lines.

779
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,914
Rym: It'll just be three exclamation points.

780
00:50:36,935 --> 00:50:43,735
Scott: Or it might be like you know farting noise something like a movie about cows Bay Bay Bay.

781
00:50:44,422 --> 00:50:46,475
Scott: It's good to have a formula for coming up with titles though.

782
00:50:46,495 --> 00:50:47,200
Scott: It makes a lot easier.

783
00:50:47,401 --> 00:50:48,228
Scott: Otherwise you sit there going.

784
00:50:48,248 --> 00:50:49,820
Scott: what should the title be for like 10 days?

785
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,378
Rym: God remember trying to do the panels at ConnectiCon sitting there like what are we going to call these 30 pens?

786
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,899
Scott: All right, do we got anything else to say?

787
00:50:56,221 --> 00:51:01,240
Rym: Really, I mean I'd really like Durara the same like at the exact same level that I like Baccano.

788
00:51:01,421 --> 00:51:22,040
Rym: But if you thought Baccano was too violent because it is really crazy violence like it really Especially because the violence is pretty realistic and creepy and also if Baccano was kind of too out there Just because it jumps around like in the chronology constantly And it never really lets you settle and it keeps showing you the same scenes like over and over again for different perspectives.

789
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:23,257
Rym: Everything's all over the place.

790
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,946
Rym: Durara at least seems to follow a Strict chronology of this happens.

791
00:51:27,986 --> 00:51:35,908
Rym: then this happens then this happens and the violence is much more comedic and much more interesting and much less Horribly depressingly realistically violent.

792
00:51:36,189 --> 00:51:36,812
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

793
00:51:37,696 --> 00:51:38,760
Scott: We forgot to do the meta moment.

794
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,447
Scott: Do you want to do it now?

795
00:51:39,669 --> 00:51:40,234
Rym: Right at the end?

796
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:44,060
Rym: All right We're going to be at Anime Boston doing a crazy ton of panels.

797
00:51:44,341 --> 00:51:46,568
Rym: We're going to be at Otakon doing a bunch of panels.

798
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:47,532
Scott: Otakon's way later.

799
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:49,879
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX East doing a bunch of panels.

800
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:58,594
Rym: We're running panels at ConnectiCon, so if you have an anime panel or any panel you want to do at ConnectiCon We're the ones you submit them to.

801
00:52:00,261 --> 00:52:00,944
Rym: Do we have anything else?

802
00:52:00,965 --> 00:52:02,833
Rym: The book club is Carl Sagan's cosmos.

803
00:52:03,175 --> 00:52:04,240
Rym: You anime kids should read it.

804
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:05,366
Rym: You might learn a thing.

805
00:52:05,386 --> 00:52:06,452
Rym: Might learn you something.

806
00:52:06,492 --> 00:52:06,894
Scott: Or ten.

807
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:07,940
Scott: Or a hundred.

808
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,772
Rym: You can cop out and just watch the TV show.

809
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:12,334
Scott: It's mostly the same.

810
00:52:12,355 --> 00:52:13,520
Scott: No, why are you telling them this?

811
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,905
Rym: Because I just want I don't care.

812
00:52:14,925 --> 00:52:16,371
Scott: The point is to get them to read a book.

813
00:52:16,492 --> 00:52:17,115
Scott: Read a book?

814
00:52:17,356 --> 00:52:19,043
Rym: Read a- if they if they Watch the show.

815
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:20,511
Rym: I feel like they got a third of the way there.

816
00:52:21,295 --> 00:52:22,179
Scott: That's better than zero.

817
00:52:22,742 --> 00:52:26,294
Scott: Well, if you if you watch the show and you don't read the book, you should still feel bad.

818
00:52:26,515 --> 00:52:27,619
Rym: Yeah, you should feel bad.

819
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:29,600
Rym: I don't know.

820
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,781
Rym: I don't really have anything else.

821
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:31,401
Scott: No.

822
00:52:31,642 --> 00:52:33,102
Scott: All right, so that's it.

Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
