1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,087
Rym: It's some time in 2015.

2
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:11,010
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:13,840
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is a Tuesday GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,037
Rym: This is a go up at some point cuz I'm still in Singapore.

5
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:20,860
Scott: in Australia We don't have any news because who knows what day this is or what news has happened.

6
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:23,749
Rym: Yep, and while I got some gigabytes and things those can wait.

7
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:27,040
Rym: and yeah, so we're just gonna talk about the games.

8
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:27,759
Rym: We play two packs.

9
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:29,550
Scott: Yeah, cuz they were packs.

10
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:30,620
Scott: prime was very recent.

11
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:35,465
Scott: It was the week before Labor Day this year a little bit early and we played Lot of new board game.

12
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:35,626
Scott: like.

13
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:41,586
Scott: I had a whole list of like board games on and play that I had not played yet And I played them all pretty much.

14
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:49,630
Scott: There's no board games right now that I know of maybe one that one with the Sort of Hanabi ish spell casting game.

15
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:52,200
Rym: Oh, yeah, but anyway, I played that game that games really good.

16
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:59,614
Scott: I didn't play it and won that game But we played pretty much all the other games We wanted to play and learned a whole bunch of new stuff.

17
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:00,700
Scott: so we can talk about all these games.

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,760
Rym: So we're gonna talk about a bunch that were pretty good and then as the main bit We're gonna review the one that was actually good, right?

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,840
Scott: And I think there's some other ones that deserve a full episode as well like camel up cup.

20
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:14,477
Rym: Oh camel ups getting its own episode right and camel cup can eat a dick.

21
00:01:14,517 --> 00:01:17,347
Scott: that game sucks But camel up camel up is the real deal right.

22
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,414
Rym: so also our friends who own camel up.

23
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,100
Rym: might we'll see what happens to them.

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,987
Scott: Let's do this.

25
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:35,860
Rym: so tumbling dice Kind of broke out in the sense that we played it a lot at the end of every day before we'd all go to bed Because you could kind of just like you could teach a stranger how to play this.

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,940
Scott: You don't need to teach anyone how to play tumbledice.

27
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:43,260
Scott: They look at the tumbling dice and they immediately understand how to play the game without any instructions whatsoever.

28
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,293
Rym: Strangers stood back and tried to throw their dice at it.

29
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:48,579
Rym: You did have to explain to them.

30
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:51,192
Scott: Well, I mean, that's just like playground rules, right?

31
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:52,900
Scott: It's like, you know, alright guys, you know.

32
00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:58,640
Scott: But basically the way tumbling dice works is much like the title you have dice and you tumble them.

33
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:10,090
Scott: Everyone gets 46 and you take turns tumbling them on this apparatus Which is pretty much a set of terraces and at the bottom There are these tiny terraces that say x4 on them.

34
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,555
Scott: So obviously zero.

35
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:12,136
Rym: x1 x2 x3 x4.

36
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:13,474
Rym: there's.

37
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:17,572
Scott: Obviously if your dice lands on say the x2 terrace

38
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:18,796
Rym: and you roll and

39
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:30,751
Scott: the number five is on it You have scored ten points and you take turns throwing one die at a time much like shuffleboard dice can bump other dice Usually moving them to lower tiers or off the board entirely.

40
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:49,191
Scott: and when all the dice have been tossed by all players you add up the scores of the dice remaining on the board and you try to get the highest score you can which would be Six times four because you got a six on your die on the four terrace and then you got four of those 24 times for the best possible score

41
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:50,376
Rym: this game.

42
00:02:50,477 --> 00:02:54,329
Rym: We're score Zero, that is literally it the game.

43
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:55,191
Scott: That's all there is to.

44
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:57,357
Scott: it is so simple dexterity game.

45
00:02:57,497 --> 00:02:58,119
Scott: throw dice.

46
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,407
Rym: now It matters this luck.

47
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:01,651
Scott: and there's also skill.

48
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:04,100
Scott: The skill is where does the dice end up?

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,458
Scott: Can you get the die to land on the little tiny four terraces through to those bumpers and around everyone else's?

50
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:10,140
Rym: the answer is?

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,188
Rym: Yes, I'm actually really fucking good at this game.

52
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:14,820
Scott: knock your enemy's dice off the board at the same time.

53
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:17,320
Scott: Can you do that skill wise and also luck wise?

54
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,313
Scott: What face does your die show up on?

55
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:19,980
Scott: because guess what?

56
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:25,716
Scott: You get all the way down onto the four tier with a high skill toss and it's facing one up.

57
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,465
Scott: That's four Garbage point great.

58
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:33,410
Scott: I think you get a grid if you get like a five on the two terrace Which is really easy to do.

59
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:34,819
Scott: that's ten points.

60
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,566
Rym: Well, the trick is the real strategy.

61
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:40,120
Rym: the real skill at least is you put it on the five probably or the four depend.

62
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,343
Rym: Like I had a pretty good People.

63
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:42,785
Scott: I see.

64
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,052
Scott: I was thinking that too.

65
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:49,660
Scott: when I first started reliably I was able to get the no I was watching other people who were and were not doing that.

66
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,740
Scott: Yeah, I'd obviously didn't calculate with a calculator, but it did not seem to be that there was any consistent.

67
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:59,932
Rym: Well, a lot of those people were bouncing flicking or throwing.

68
00:03:59,952 --> 00:04:02,880
Rym: I would do a straight simple slide.

69
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,890
Rym: I was very very careful.

70
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,594
Scott: you'd as far.

71
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:06,720
Scott: I was watching you as well.

72
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:10,498
Scott: I did not notice you getting consistently higher results on your die face.

73
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,139
Scott: I definitely was got plenty of ones and twos just like everyone else.

74
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:21,111
Scott: Well, usually because I got knocked into a place and the die rolled over I would have well Maybe if you had gotten a one to begin with.

75
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,774
Scott: then he got knocked.

76
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:22,960
Scott: it would have ended up as a five.

77
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:35,840
Scott: Yeah, baby is a lot so that there is a. you know Regardless of how much jigaboo jones you have the fact that you don't throw all your dice at once Last and other people get to throw after you even if you can jigaboo jones and get the face up that you want.

78
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:39,312
Scott: There is a luck element, which is the facing of the die.

79
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:41,280
Scott: The skill element is where the die goes.

80
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,822
Rym: Yeah, it's.

81
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:43,448
Rym: it's also just kind of shuffleboard.

82
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:46,620
Rym: Like what order the players go in matters a fuck ton.

83
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:48,140
Scott: It creates a lot of excitement.

84
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:56,940
Rym: I think we could fix a bit a problem with the game by instead of doing round robin turn order doing some other like snake Or some other form of player turn order.

85
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:04,848
Scott: We've also you had the obvious idea of don't just use d6 use all kinds of other die use different die Maybe bigger ones maybe smaller ones.

86
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:05,511
Rym: We experimented.

87
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:10,109
Scott: actually the other dice did not work that well No, I think you know, there's a lot going on here.

88
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,920
Scott: You can make different terraces with different bumpers.

89
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:15,252
Rym: Well, no, you can't with the game by default the game.

90
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:16,820
Scott: No, but I mean you could make a time.

91
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:17,939
Rym: Yeah, I was getting to that.

92
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,338
Rym: So this game and tumbling die is basically like one of those Toys R Us Milton Bradley style games that it's been re-released a million times.

93
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:28,093
Rym: Yeah, I think you've seen a normal toy store much like crocodile.

94
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:28,836
Scott: You should make one.

95
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,000
Scott: I suggest not so.

96
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:32,733
Rym: Yeah, if you go to board game geek you see all these different additions.

97
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:34,340
Rym: even the official ones are all slightly different.

98
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:38,333
Rym: But then people posted pictures of the custom sets.

99
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:40,540
Scott: They made that is a real tumbling dice, right?

100
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,348
Scott: Yeah, that is the highest quality tumbling dice.

101
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:43,890
Scott: Look at this.

102
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,680
Scott: Oh, that's like a. that's the god of tumbling die.

103
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,610
Rym: That is for tumbling dies.

104
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:54,120
Rym: and look it goes one, two, three four one Two three four and there's a zero hanging out each one of these places.

105
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,071
Scott: Whoa, they just stack tumbling dices on top of each other.

106
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:02,388
Rym: four sets of tumbling dice that they call it Niagara Falls, that is incredible.

107
00:06:02,408 --> 00:06:04,454
Scott: How many but do you throw for 16 die?

108
00:06:04,474 --> 00:06:06,400
Rym: Oh, it's those comments here.

109
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:07,618
Rym: So is this for real?

110
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:10,913
Rym: And the response is we played one game.

111
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:11,879
Rym: No, it doesn't work.

112
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:15,520
Rym: I guess if I were to put them on the sides instead blah blah blah blah.

113
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:19,406
Scott: Yeah, cuz as dice get further from you They're gonna spread out sideways.

114
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:21,915
Scott: trying to get him go straight down a bowling alley is pretty difficult.

115
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:23,360
Rym: I think it would work better.

116
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:24,470
Rym: I think they just were low skill.

117
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,503
Rym: We'll see we'll see We won't see it.

118
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:28,931
Scott: let's begin again for tumbling dice and stack them up.

119
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:30,415
Rym: but tumbling dice is.

120
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:40,931
Rym: it's in this class of games I'll actually aside from the dexterity component It's in this other like meta class of games that are good at Attracting strangers and getting them to play a game with you.

121
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:48,059
Scott: much like you can walk up to a tumbled nice Throw your four dice and I get a minute and then leave and know exactly what your score was and cheer or whatever.

122
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:48,581
Scott: and you're Good,

123
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:58,943
Rym: but we met a bunch of cool people just because like we had it out and strangers would be like, hey What do you like to walk over to watch and when you can turn to someone and be like you see this really weird thing We're doing you

124
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,855
Scott: want to do until you hand them for d6 and be like, you're green.

125
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:02,538
Scott: Oh, you're not green.

126
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:02,960
Scott: cuz I'm green.

127
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:04,625
Scott: Yeah, take the red dice.

128
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:06,471
Scott: Okay, then they play.

129
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:07,475
Scott: they don't need to know anything.

130
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,080
Rym: It's like zendo does the same thing.

131
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,440
Rym: You have a game that's weird and has a weird crowd around it and people are attracted to it even more than that.

132
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,892
Scott: Cuz the zendo and set and those sorts of things that need some sort of instruction.

133
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:23,920
Scott: tumbling dice needs nothing other than Intelligence and looking at it for a minute not even a minute less than a minute.

134
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,430
Rym: Yeah even the get the first packs.

135
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,182
Rym: we went to an oh wait in Seattle.

136
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:38,580
Rym: the game that attracted a huge crowd where he met a bunch of cool people and then had like friends for the rest of The packs was via Paletti which still required like rules and explanation but had a spectacle.

137
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:41,430
Rym: Yeah, this is the spectacle that requires no rules or explanation.

138
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:42,695
Scott: Anyway, someone dies.

139
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:44,039
Rym: Yeah, tumbling dies pretty good.

140
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:45,791
Scott: What other game do you want to talk about for?

141
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:52,860
Scott: so Viticulture viticulture is a worker placement game with a really good theme and it's not a great worker placement game.

142
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,216
Rym: Yep, it relies too much on cards and fiddly actions.

143
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:57,161
Rym: the cards It's imagine It's so.

144
00:07:57,563 --> 00:07:58,526
Rym: it has all these mechanics.

145
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:05,512
Rym: like you get grapes and the grapes age which doesn't happen in the real world But nonetheless the grapes can age and get better over time.

146
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,360
Scott: You can turn them into wine which also ages.

147
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:15,228
Scott: Yeah Independently you turn and then you fill orders and you can fill orders with better wine than they asked for but you can just fill The orders and get points.

148
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:20,954
Scott: and we played it once And it was yeah, I mean, I can't make you a whole episode.

149
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:23,232
Scott: something played once but first of all We played with six players.

150
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:23,859
Scott: big mistake.

151
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:29,200
Scott: Play with four or less players because it takes forever if you play with the people who like the game.

152
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,110
Rym: We're like, no, no, no.

153
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:30,940
Rym: six players is bullshit.

154
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:32,544
Scott: Yeah The car.

155
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:35,375
Scott: in a curricula you start the game with a hand of cards and that's it.

156
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:44,300
Scott: in this game You basically can take actions to get different kinds of cards But then the cards are multiple actions and the cards are all over the place.

157
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,513
Scott: They range cards were useless garbage and some cards were ridiculously powerful.

158
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,637
Scott: Fuck over everyone else.

159
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:50,560
Scott: get a million points.

160
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,976
Rym: Yeah, like you think a potato dibber was overpowered in a curricula?

161
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:54,579
Rym: No, no, no, no.

162
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:57,829
Rym: That potato dibber is a little bit over.

163
00:08:57,849 --> 00:08:59,940
Scott: the theme of the game though is ridiculously fun.

164
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,116
Scott: I started the game with a tasting room and every time I went with the tasting room.

165
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:13,600
Rym: I'm like, oh Yeah, I did really well despite bitten fuck by the fact that one the rules were taught slightly incorrectly because Much-like ground floor and all those other Kickstarter kind of games.

166
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:18,020
Rym: This game has some like fiddly not intuitive mechanics along the way.

167
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,821
Scott: But as all these custom wooden bits to represent the tasting room and my favorite the truss truss you like trusses What about?

168
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:26,106
Scott: has little has little grapes?

169
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:27,271
Scott: Hey, hey, can't hang in from it.

170
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:28,957
Scott: Yeah, that's the most useless thing.

171
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:29,600
Scott: No one built it.

172
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:31,283
Rym: No, someone used.

173
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:32,766
Rym: someone built it because they it was a mistake.

174
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,494
Rym: They used it to harvest once mistake.

175
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:49,458
Scott: Yeah anyway, but yeah the You know, you get all these little wooden things to represent all the like upgrades you make to your vintner facilities Which were kind of fun getting a tasting room and a truss because he's like you get to put the little wooden thing.

176
00:09:49,498 --> 00:10:01,275
Scott: that has Wouldn't great, but my initial read is that I don't think it was play tested very closely like very well No, and they just took work replacement added a theme and they're like I. well they added

177
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:17,806
Rym: theme and I think I'm pretty sure the game designers Jamie Stag Meyer and Alan Stone They my guess I don't know them I don't anything about them is that they had a cool idea about a game where you get grapes and wine and the wine can Age and they kind of just and they

178
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:19,472
Scott: made the mechanics fit the theme.

179
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:28,317
Rym: they used mechanics that were you know Tried and true and they came up with clever mechanics along the way Like there's all these things and every one of them can be upgraded.

180
00:10:28,357 --> 00:10:28,860
Rym: That's cool.

181
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:32,916
Scott: Yeah, they made it really match the theme and as a result the game suffers.

182
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,927
Rym: Yeah I'll play.

183
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,583
Rym: we got to play it a couple more times because it's moderately I don't need.

184
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,359
Scott: I mean I could play it a couple more times, but it's like I'm gonna do it.

185
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:43,153
Scott: I had enough worker placement games.

186
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:44,080
Scott: I don't need to play anymore.

187
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,299
Rym: so I'll say this if you trust our first impressions you can skip this one.

188
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:54,356
Scott: if You don't trust our first you really like worker placement that much that you want to play.

189
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:59,280
Rym: like every worker placement I'll play Kayla's first if you and then a curricula and then play kverna.

190
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,064
Scott: It's like you really have.

191
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:00,950
Scott: you have those like me.

192
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,739
Scott: if you have that many worker placements You really need another one.

193
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:13,496
Scott: Yeah Lord, you must really really really fucking like wine and really want to get off on the fantasy of growing what grapes and playing with A little wooden truss also, you don't make.

194
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:18,800
Rym: well Anyway, the theme actually is pretty broken if you actually know a lot about wine, so it's a little yeah.

195
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:29,400
Rym: But I mean, you know, it at least feels like wine making, you know, you get the stomping things you step on the grave Yeah, and then you can stop immediately but keep them forever and they never go bad and they get better over time after you stomp.

196
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,409
Scott: Yes Older is always better.

197
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:35,400
Scott: It might not actually be better, but you can sell it for more.

198
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:45,637
Rym: But if I played a few more times, I guess they could if they really wanted to be thematic There should be some more vinegar in this game Like the vinegar would be the equivalent of the brown peppers in Scoville.

199
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,723
Rym: Oh Yeah But it's just.

200
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:55,609
Rym: it's in that classic games that unless you're hurting for a game It's not that good.

201
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,980
Scott: And if you've got this game, you're so into board games.

202
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,179
Scott: You definitely have another worker placement game on hand.

203
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:08,880
Scott: Yeah you definitely do and you're not telling me that you're gonna in a worker placement mood and this in Viticulture is the only worker placement game that you have with you.

204
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:18,640
Rym: Like if you play this game more than four or five times period you're gonna have a really clear Specific path through this game and hope that you get the cards.

205
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:24,940
Rym: I suspect there are several degenerate strategies than like Scott hit and at the cards are literally all that matter which is also true for.

206
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:31,000
Rym: But it takes a lot longer to get to that and the cards are all pretty equally powered except the overpowered potato-dibber.

207
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:35,759
Rym: Seriously every time I draw the potato-dibber I win like every time.

208
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,459
Rym: So we also played each of us once in two separate games.

209
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,053
Rym: Elysium, okay, which had a. it had a clever mechanic.

210
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:55,260
Scott: Well, the mechanic was explained to me incorrectly Correctly as well and then it was corrected midway through the game and I still managed to win.

211
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:59,880
Rym: I came in second place because I had a ridiculous fucking combo.

212
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,622
Rym: I had a card that gave you you know, the classic one victory point for every three victory points Mm-hmm.

213
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:08,200
Rym: I had a way to that twice in a row at the end of the game.

214
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,960
Rym: Yeah, so basically the way the game where he beat me because he happened to have a card.

215
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,788
Rym: Oh, you don't be zillion points.

216
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:14,270
Scott: You didn't win.

217
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,981
Rym: He had a card that pushed him past me Okay.

218
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:23,919
Scott: But anyway, so the way the game works is you've got these four sticks of different colors and on your turn There's a whole bunch of cards out in the field.

219
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:31,642
Scott: You can basically or and there's also like these plates you can take and you spend one of your sticks to take some of the Stuff.

220
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:33,380
Scott: take something from the field, right?

221
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:41,160
Rym: But you have to have a stick on the spent of the color of the thing But you don't have to spend that one to take the thing.

222
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:50,310
Rym: so if I have a red and a green I can take something that has a red or Something that has a green on it or something that has a red or green and a colorless one showing you have to have at least two.

223
00:13:51,182 --> 00:13:53,649
Rym: But then I give up any one of my sticks.

224
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,335
Scott: see I was told incorrectly.

225
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,140
Scott: the incorrect part that I was told was okay.

226
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,139
Scott: Look, you want to use your red to take that card.

227
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:04,900
Scott: You still have to have your red and discard one of the different non red stick.

228
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,904
Rym: That's what I was told too.

229
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:06,807
Scott: And that's not correct.

230
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:10,340
Scott: What you can discard the red stick and take the red card.

231
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:13,520
Rym: Oh, I was told that you could discard whatever you wanted and take the red card.

232
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,487
Scott: Yes, so you were told correct.

233
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:16,140
Scott: Okay, so I was told incorrectly.

234
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:22,672
Scott: I thought if I wanted to take the red card, I had to still have my red stick after Discarding one of my sticks.

235
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:24,140
Scott: so that right which was incorrect.

236
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,859
Scott: So I was like, you know really restricting myself early in the game.

237
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:34,820
Scott: but anyway, all the all the cards you get are Part of different Greek gods or whatever right and shit like that and actually much like viticulture.

238
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,248
Rym: they're all the fuck.

239
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:43,560
Rym: take seven wonders right and Expand the scope of what a card could do like ten times over right?

240
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,840
Rym: So basically every card was like the crazy victory point cards at the end of the game.

241
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:57,200
Scott: The way it works is when you get a card it goes on top in front of your sort of play area And when it's in front of your play area the text on the card is active.

242
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:58,384
Scott: It's like you.

243
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,333
Scott: it's like a building you've built in glory to Rome, right?

244
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:01,774
Scott: It does.

245
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:03,580
Scott: or a creature you summon in magic?

246
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:04,336
Scott: It does stuff.

247
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:11,619
Scott: So one strategy in the game is to get a bunch of cards out in front and use their powers combined To get a lot of points.

248
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:18,619
Scott: The other thing you can do is if you get all the cards have numbers and colors because the color goes to the god It goes with and they're numbered like one two, three four.

249
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:24,980
Scott: You can get cards in sets and like gin rummy sets like no, you know, one two, three all same.

250
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:27,560
Rym: That stuff was actually all explained to me incorrectly.

251
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,045
Scott: Explain to me incorrectly at all.

252
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:34,680
Rym: Yeah that part so I thought I was making a set that turned out was not a set.

253
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:37,433
Scott: Yeah, there's a little helper card that I kept looking at.

254
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:38,760
Rym: I still almost won though.

255
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,260
Scott: Yeah, there's a little helper card that tells you what sets you can make.

256
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:50,733
Scott: So if you build up in front of your area enough cards to make one of these sort of, you know runs You can then spend an action or there's different.

257
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:52,400
Rym: You could put them down at any time.

258
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:54,510
Rym: You can only put down another card that might like.

259
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,560
Rym: you have to put it into the set or make it its own set.

260
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:02,360
Rym: Cards in the front of your thing Also have a power you can do once you pull them into the back.

261
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:05,907
Rym: They can't do their powers and I pulled it But they're worth victory.

262
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,720
Rym: points cards in the front or with bupkis at the end of the game, right?

263
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,651
Scott: So it's like you when a card is in the front you use its ability To get points and do things to help you.

264
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:19,160
Scott: so like a card is on the bottom The card is disabled, but you've made a set that is now worth victory.

265
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:20,980
Rym: Here's the best way I can describe it.

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,240
Scott: And if you're the first person to make a particular kind of set you get a fuck ton of it.

267
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:25,948
Scott: Bonus points from the side.

268
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:28,360
Rym: So here's the best way I'll describe it because it's GeekNights.

269
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,486
Rym: You guys have played magic.

270
00:16:29,546 --> 00:16:31,960
Rym: probably say I've got my land war elves.

271
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:33,326
Rym: Yeah I can give.

272
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:41,860
Rym: I have to have my green Forest stick out still to take the land where elves and I discard any stick you including that you could be the green one.

273
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,129
Rym: Yes, it could be anything right now.

274
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,479
Rym: I've got the land where elves in front of me.

275
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:48,316
Rym: I can tap them to get that mana at any point.

276
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:49,120
Rym: I have some power now.

277
00:16:49,140 --> 00:17:01,480
Rym: It's a power I can just use on my turn or if you get two more elves At any point on my turns I can use my power to pull the land war elves back.

278
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,895
Rym: Once they're pulled back I can never tap them again.

279
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:05,900
Scott: I don't think it's any time.

280
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:08,220
Scott: I don't only played it once and I remember that well.

281
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,353
Scott: But I thought you could like only move a certain number of things according to.

282
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:13,276
Scott: yeah, you have a.

283
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:15,567
Rym: it's like a Dominion You know, I don't know.

284
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:17,680
Scott: I didn't think it was any time on your turn either.

285
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,252
Rym: I thought oh, it's when you have that action right there.

286
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,720
Rym: I'm skipping a lot of those fiddly.

287
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,590
Scott: So there's a limit to how many things you can pull.

288
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,319
Rym: there is an economy, you know what it's like.

289
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,208
Rym: It's like the merchant and glory to Rome.

290
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:29,072
Scott: Yes, exactly.

291
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:31,020
Scott: You have to take that action to move stuff down.

292
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:37,220
Rym: Sometimes you get two of that action or three Exactly and the game actually goes really quick and you have very few turns.

293
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:39,436
Rym: Yeah, you pretty much gotta pull something back every turn.

294
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:43,460
Rym: You're fucked Yep, but so the land where elves are out in front of you at the end of the game.

295
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:51,366
Rym: You could have tapped them on that last turn but you get zero points for them if they're pulled back by the end of the Game, they couldn't be tapped once they have pulled back But they're worth a victory point.

296
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,560
Rym: if you got three land where elves they're worth like nine victory points.

297
00:17:54,821 --> 00:18:08,454
Rym: and if you got a land where elf and something that caused two and a war elephant and What I'm trying to think of creatures with those Then it'll be worth another set of points and at the end of the game most points wins.

298
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:12,145
Rym: I Don't think it's a good game.

299
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:13,148
Scott: I don't think it's good either.

300
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:16,520
Rym: It's got a lot of clever mechanics, but they're not intuitive.

301
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:26,106
Rym: there's too many of them and just like Viticulture like it like it's a lot like when you play it seven wonders But seven wonders.

302
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:35,540
Rym: the card colors have a pretty constrained set of things they can do Such that they can be represented by a relatively simple system of icons.

303
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:41,377
Scott: This that you have to look up every time you play true, but at least that gives you some parameters.

304
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:47,175
Rym: this game Imagine one cards like get three gold and another card is a paragraph of bullshit.

305
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:47,756
Rym: You can do.

306
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:53,073
Rym: Yeah, it's So all over the place that unless you have memorized every single card in the game.

307
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:55,500
Rym: You cannot have a strategy.

308
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:59,518
Scott: So what I did is I basically found a card and I won the game.

309
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:01,088
Scott: by the way The one I played.

310
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:11,049
Scott: I found a card that was like hey take a card that's out in front of you throw it away and take a random card from the deck and Put it in front of you to replace.

311
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,500
Rym: I got that same car.

312
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:18,240
Scott: I basically took all my other cards and made perfect sets and kept putting them behind as quickly as possible.

313
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:20,420
Scott: Cuz that's the direct path to victory points, right?

314
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,389
Scott: I kept getting the bonus shits.

315
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:29,579
Scott: cuz I was the first one to do so and then I kept that one card out there and kept using it once a turn cuz that's as much as I could use it.

316
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,940
Scott: and You get these guys that are like wild cards if you move them back, but they're also negative victory points.

317
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:36,527
Rym: Oh, yeah, the citizens.

318
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:42,958
Scott: I kept discarding the citizens with that power to go and get new cards that weren't citizens.

319
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:47,660
Scott: and You know, it's like I'm just getting free cards all over the place.

320
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,304
Rym: Oh, I did it.

321
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:50,920
Rym: I did a thing that basically I could tap these guys.

322
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,357
Scott: I basically scored like six points by throwing away three citizens and then scored another set of points.

323
00:19:56,397 --> 00:20:00,673
Scott: cuz that got me a set of Cards, I got like 20 or 30 points for my bullshit combo of.

324
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:02,240
Rym: I got some cards that I could keep tapping.

325
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:03,805
Rym: Just keep getting victory points.

326
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,991
Scott: I had 15 points just from bonus each.

327
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,498
Rym: It's I had like 40 from bonus each.

328
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:16,980
Rym: It's Yeah at the end of the game I had like 60 something from bonus chits because I don't nobody else's getting any points.

329
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:22,972
Rym: I did I basically did things to get a ton of bonus chits Because I got a card that gave me a point for every three bonus point.

330
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,200
Scott: Oh, no, I'm talking about those ones.

331
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,211
Scott: I'm talking about the ones where like the first one to get a black set.

332
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:28,753
Scott: Yes.

333
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:30,800
Rym: I got two of those.

334
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,848
Scott: Yeah, those the regular victory point shits.

335
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,194
Scott: I only had a moderate number of.

336
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:34,535
Scott: I didn't.

337
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:35,760
Scott: I didn't go hard on that.

338
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:41,209
Rym: There's so many other mechanics in this game that I Unless I showed you a bunch of examples.

339
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:43,880
Rym: I could not teach this to you without visual aids.

340
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:46,651
Scott: I do think though that you could take the stick mechanic.

341
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:48,900
Scott: Yeah and apply that to a different game.

342
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:50,623
Scott: That would be interesting.

343
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:52,871
Rym: stick mechanic was extra good because it had the.

344
00:20:53,574 --> 00:21:00,939
Rym: if you get fucked and can't take anything You have to take a citizen they kind of suck and it also sort of forced you into like not it.

345
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,092
Scott: You couldn't just pick the thing you wanted right.

346
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04,300
Scott: a lot of worker placement games.

347
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,929
Scott: It's like you have a worker.

348
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,880
Scott: put it on one of the workplaces here.

349
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:12,965
Scott: It's like you have a red or green a blue and a yellow and they're all different and if you use you know You can.

350
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:23,533
Scott: if you have the red one You can still do red actions But you're gonna give up the right to do a green yellow every turn you say this this set of the cards out there I cannot take.

351
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:31,015
Scott: yeah So and as you take more and more actions The number of actions still available to you is more and more limited which it does.

352
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:38,540
Rym: this power like this mechanic Heavily reduces analysis paralysis because every choice you take closes a whole bunch of doors.

353
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,448
Scott: And it's just it's not even like you.

354
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,556
Scott: the doors are actually closed.

355
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:43,420
Scott: You just don't realize it.

356
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,731
Scott: It's like no they are closed.

357
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:45,699
Scott: You cannot do that.

358
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:53,445
Rym: So you get in a situation of like I want I want to take I want to discard my red one but if I do Scott could do.

359
00:21:53,586 --> 00:21:57,080
Rym: take the red the one of the other actions like the final action.

360
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:02,932
Rym: You know the thing that you have to take one of the adventure or whatever Fucking me and forcing me to not be able to take one.

361
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:05,684
Scott: All right, let's talk about let's not Let's talk about.

362
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,373
Rym: not I know you're gonna talk about the other mechanics.

363
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,620
Scott: No, let's be done with Elysium.

364
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,411
Rym: Yeah, Elysium I think is the worst of the games.

365
00:22:11,451 --> 00:22:13,660
Rym: we talked about a lot of clever ideas.

366
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:14,984
Scott: It's not a game.

367
00:22:15,024 --> 00:22:15,767
Scott: I want to play.

368
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:18,320
Scott: I have no desire to ever play Elysium again once again.

369
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:27,060
Rym: I don't hate it But I don't have a desire to design a game and the core of your and it has a bunch of clear specific simple or interesting mechanics.

370
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:32,980
Rym: But you have a side mechanic of a lot of cards with a lot of paragraphs of text on them.

371
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:35,612
Rym: Your game is probably poorly designed.

372
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:36,115
Scott: It better be.

373
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:41,060
Scott: it better be a card game Yep, and you don't realize it's poorly designed because the like Dominion or something.

374
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:46,224
Rym: Yep all that text on the cards is Obfuscating the bad design.

375
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:48,310
Rym: seven wonders is just that.

376
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:49,413
Rym: like that is the game.

377
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,075
Rym: those cards.

378
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:51,077
Scott: sushi goes even better.

379
00:22:51,258 --> 00:23:00,175
Rym: sushi goes great anyway.

380
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:02,105
Rym: things of the day.

381
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:06,626
Scott: I think I used this as a thing of the day already, but Rym says I did not.

382
00:23:06,706 --> 00:23:07,570
Rym: I don't think you did.

383
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:09,759
Scott: I think I did but I'll do it again.

384
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:11,667
Rym: Anyway, so I forgot what my thing of the day was.

385
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:12,410
Rym: you do your thing?

386
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,494
Rym: Oh, I remember I remember.

387
00:23:13,554 --> 00:23:23,063
Scott: here is a video of some Russian gentlemen and They found while fishing or something or I don't know what the hell they're doing.

388
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:31,750
Scott: They found a can of rations from the war as in 1940 something Soviet rations in a can.

389
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:35,218
Rym: Is this like that guy who found that beer in his gutter?

390
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:39,989
Scott: and they open that can and they dig right in these happy old Russian dudes.

391
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:56,129
Rym: There's some sort of meat like material in this can Watch at your own risk Alright that this sounds a lot like that video the guy who found a buy a can of beer in his gutter from the 80s And tried to chug it.

392
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:01,390
Scott: I think that one is actually worse than this one, but that one though is the least funny because of how immediate.

393
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:05,188
Rym: So that video spoilers not Scott's video projectile.

394
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:05,490
Scott: vomiting.

395
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:14,590
Rym: The guy throws the his head back to drink the beer and vomits so fast That it's almost a violation of the speed of light and causality.

396
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:23,053
Scott: Like the vomit comes out like as soon as the beer like it's near his face It's whole stomach just turns Back.

397
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:25,120
Rym: that before the beer even got into his mouth.

398
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:27,910
Rym: The brain was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the hell are you doing?

399
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,720
Scott: Everything from digestive system in both directions.

400
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:45,235
Rym: So if you're ever in New York City It had there's a thing in a few streets aren't that many of these that very few cities in the world have Let alone in New York where they're super rare.

401
00:24:45,616 --> 00:24:53,850
Rym: Sometimes you'll see it's really really tall building and There'll be another really really tall building and there will be a sky bridge connecting the two of them.

402
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:55,798
Scott: If you sky bridges around this guy.

403
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,662
Scott: some of them are like clothes like you can actually get into them Even if you're in the building, it's just too hard to tear them down.

404
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:06,004
Rym: There's a few that are used out there Yeah, but not many because in cities like there are a lot of sky bridges.

405
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:15,050
Rym: in mid-tier cities like in Boston You'll see him because they connect like a mall to another mall and stuff like that Yeah, or a hotel to the office building next to it.

406
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:28,130
Rym: but in New York the few of these things that remain are usually connecting like Private building to private building that are not both owned by the same people anymore And there's no public way in the world to get into these things and you probably wouldn't want to anyway.

407
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:32,490
Rym: So there's one that I'd seen often like I passed by this thing a lot and I recognized it.

408
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,839
Rym: I saw that I saw a picture of it.

409
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:35,067
Rym: There's article in Gothamist about it.

410
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:45,190
Rym: Apparently it connected an apartment To a fashion studio because the guy who lived in the apartment ran the fashion studio.

411
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:47,629
Rym: Okay, and it's really big and cool and old.

412
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:53,956
Rym: By coincidence right now The fashion studio was turned into an apartment.

413
00:25:54,277 --> 00:25:56,584
Rym: So it's two apartments on my two totally different sets of people.

414
00:25:57,226 --> 00:25:58,350
Rym: They're both for sale.

415
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,278
Scott: So you could buy both.

416
00:26:01,418 --> 00:26:07,602
Rym: if you buy both you get the sky bridge Sure, and apparently the sky you only buy one.

417
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:08,647
Scott: you get half the sky bridge.

418
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:09,230
Rym: I don't know.

419
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:09,953
Rym: I guess that one.

420
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:12,887
Rym: I guess one building owns it so you just don't get it like the door.

421
00:26:14,014 --> 00:26:15,409
Rym: Okay, like I don't know how that works.

422
00:26:15,976 --> 00:26:23,110
Rym: But yeah You could buy these two apartments and you get an extra room above the street in New York City.

423
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:24,525
Scott: I mean you can afford that.

424
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:31,610
Scott: call me I would buy this apartment if I could because if I could afford one of them I would buy it and someone else could buy the other one like you and then we'd have the sky bridge.

425
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,070
Rym: Yeah a sky bridge.

426
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,597
Rym: Do you know what I could do with the sky bridge?

427
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:37,290
Scott: one shot walk across the street without getting hit by a car.

428
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:39,061
Rym: That would be just an egg one.

429
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:39,403
Rym: I've got.

430
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:40,390
Rym: I live in two buildings.

431
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:42,118
Rym: That's cool enough to you get.

432
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:44,368
Scott: you could have mail sent to here or there.

433
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:47,396
Scott: Wouldn't be hard to get the mail what I do.

434
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:50,805
Scott: You could have delivery to either one if you.

435
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:52,910
Scott: oh, I'm in the kitchen now.

436
00:26:53,331 --> 00:26:55,057
Scott: I really like delivery to come here.

437
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:56,040
Scott: Oh, I'm in the bedroom.

438
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:58,567
Scott: I'll just send the delivery to a different address.

439
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:02,957
Rym: Oh There's an update The so date line.

440
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,590
Rym: according to the listing the units are exclusively off for sale together.

441
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:12,418
Rym: If the first time I've been over 30 years the residence is six thousand three hundred square feet Combined.

442
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:16,057
Scott: Okay, that's It's pretty York plenty.

443
00:27:16,077 --> 00:27:16,699
Rym: You'd live in that.

444
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,121
Scott: I'm good.

445
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:17,603
Scott: I'll take it.

446
00:27:18,064 --> 00:27:19,730
Rym: Yeah third floor level stable street.

447
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,999
Scott: So yeah, who's got the monies?

448
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:21,542
Scott: bring it up.

449
00:27:21,744 --> 00:27:22,186
Rym: Let's do it.

450
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:24,701
Rym: guys You want us to do more.

451
00:27:24,863 --> 00:27:25,610
Rym: ten of videos, right?

452
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,459
Scott: Yeah Buy us this antenna like living situation.

453
00:27:28,721 --> 00:27:37,610
Rym: if you buy us this apartment I will make videos for you 40 hours a week for the next 20 years with good sky bridge lighting.

454
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,138
Rym: Yeah, we'll make the videos in the sky bridge.

455
00:27:40,178 --> 00:27:40,499
Rym: Sure.

456
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,638
Rym: So the best game we played Apax Was another Friedman freeze game.

457
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:50,829
Scott: who's actually one of our Friedman freeze if you don't know is the power grid.

458
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:54,870
Scott: guy Yep, and all his games come in a green box and all his games are have a name.

459
00:27:55,212 --> 00:27:56,928
Scott: That is two words that begin with F.

460
00:27:58,071 --> 00:28:00,119
Rym: Power grid was translated for German.

461
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:05,241
Scott: the German name of power grid is two words that begin with F. Don't get on me about this non German speakers.

462
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,190
Rym: Yeah, I'll cast elk fast, right?

463
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,890
Scott: We played a Friedman freeze game that is not new, but we hadn't played it before.

464
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,617
Scott: We played it maybe three or four times at packs.

465
00:28:13,637 --> 00:28:16,629
Scott: Yep, and that game is fresh fish fresh fish.

466
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:25,070
Rym: Our joke at PAX was saying it increasingly like that just as the weekend went on, right?

467
00:28:25,191 --> 00:28:29,038
Scott: So the way fresh fish works, it's pretty simple game On the board.

468
00:28:29,058 --> 00:28:29,803
Scott: There are these four.

469
00:28:29,844 --> 00:28:30,690
Rym: well, it's simple.

470
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:31,201
Rym: But

471
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:45,267
Scott: yes there are four food trucks and You are have four carts one cart per truck and you want to get your fish cart as close to the fish truck as you Can and you want to get your soda truck your soda cart as close to the soda truck as you can.

472
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:46,010
Scott: that way?

473
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,779
Scott: you know the food delivery comes in the truck.

474
00:28:49,401 --> 00:29:00,809
Scott: you sell the food out of your cart and The food that you sell be fresher than the food other people sell because the delivery took less time to get to your store theme than other people's stores.

475
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,217
Rym: barely even Comes close to making sense.

476
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,004
Scott: No, it makes no sense whatsoever.

477
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:08,510
Rym: But especially when you see the game who would be?

478
00:29:08,772 --> 00:29:10,001
Scott: I really like the art.

479
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:10,606
Scott: The art is good.

480
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,090
Scott: Yeah, it is.

481
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,653
Scott: It's that kind of.

482
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:11,934
Scott: it's like.

483
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:15,230
Scott: it's almost like a garbage pail kids style but cuter and kid.

484
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,054
Rym: Yeah, like the.

485
00:29:16,095 --> 00:29:20,435
Scott: I know what the name for it is, but I've seen it around that I really like it Particularly like the fish.

486
00:29:20,555 --> 00:29:29,830
Rym: actually the fish is okay, but the your score at the end is How the combined total of how many spaces away from each cart or from each truck?

487
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,630
Scott: Your respective cart is now due to the rules of the game You have to be at least one space away.

488
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:40,050
Scott: So like you could get a four because each you masterfully got every cart one space away from every truck.

489
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:45,330
Rym: Yeah, so that already is a pretty solid mechanic for like a simple but complex game.

490
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:52,241
Rym: to add to that The way you play is you put Reservation tokens out on your turn.

491
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:56,070
Rym: you either draw tile from the bag Which we'll talk about or you put a reservation token out.

492
00:29:56,331 --> 00:30:00,510
Rym: The reality is you put reservation tokens out for a long time.

493
00:30:00,913 --> 00:30:02,610
Rym: You've got six of them and you just keep putting them out.

494
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:09,718
Scott: You could go really risky and go to the bag early if someone but if you go to the bag when you don't have a lot Of tokens out you're pretty much just hurting yourself.

495
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:25,170
Scott: So it really they get the rules of the games sometimes But usually if you don't have a lot of tokens on the board you're almost definitely going to hurt yourself, so there's not a lot of incentive to just go straight for the bag and Hoping you'll fuck someone else instead of and luckily not fuck yourself.

496
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,990
Rym: Like you'll know when with people who've played this game before if someone goes to the bag early a hush falls over the crowd.

497
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:34,525
Rym: It's like oh, you're going in that bag with like two tokens.

498
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:35,530
Rym: I'm gonna put that card.

499
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,334
Rym: We're gonna write that car.

500
00:30:36,354 --> 00:30:39,190
Scott: It's like you don't have any reservation token anywhere near the fish.

501
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:41,243
Scott: What if you pull the fish out of that bag?

502
00:30:41,263 --> 00:30:42,148
Scott: You are just fuck.

503
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:44,296
Rym: Yep So here's the other main mechanic.

504
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:48,670
Rym: you have 14 chips or 15 chips some number of chips that you want their money.

505
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:50,065
Scott: Oh, yeah, and you want a low score.

506
00:30:50,126 --> 00:30:51,975
Scott: obviously It's golf low store.

507
00:30:52,156 --> 00:30:58,670
Rym: The chips are negative points and you bid them When a cart of a particular type comes up, right?

508
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:04,324
Scott: So someone reaches in the bag and pulls out the fish card Which means it's time for somebody to put out a fish cart.

509
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:08,210
Rym: closed fist auction Whoever bid the most puts their cart out, right?

510
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:11,222
Scott: So you everyone's got reservation tokens near the fish.

511
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,110
Scott: everyone does a closed fist auction.

512
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:20,050
Scott: See who bids the most and then that person gets to put their replace one of their reservation tokens with the fish cart.

513
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:22,440
Rym: That is theirs now because we're all pro.

514
00:31:22,461 --> 00:31:24,509
Rym: I mean Chris and Anthony who are pretty pro.

515
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,174
Scott: They owe the game.

516
00:31:25,214 --> 00:31:26,343
Rym: Yeah, they're literally.

517
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:30,550
Rym: they weren't playing nothing But they played mostly Friedman Freese games because they also had familiar with them.

518
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:43,890
Rym: but so in pro mode what you'll see if someone fucks up is Everybody bid zero because the person who drew the tile wins because they break a tie that way and that's why it's very dangerous.

519
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:44,958
Scott: And they're all yours.

520
00:31:45,623 --> 00:31:48,494
Rym: Oh the tile out Your fish cart.

521
00:31:48,554 --> 00:31:49,558
Rym: you only have one token up.

522
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,590
Rym: Oh, I guess you're getting max score on the fish car, right?

523
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,559
Scott: It's like so Rym goes in the bag thinking.

524
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,690
Scott: Hey, hey, hey, I'll pull out a card and screw these guys.

525
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,722
Scott: I don't have a lot of tokens out, but I'll screw them over.

526
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:00,049
Scott: you pull out the fish cart.

527
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:04,390
Scott: Everyone sees that your token is like on the other side of the board far away from the fish.

528
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:05,794
Scott: Everyone bid zero.

529
00:32:06,095 --> 00:32:10,630
Scott: Rym now must put his fish cart on that faraway token and it's worth a million points.

530
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:16,902
Rym: yeah, Scott might be like seven eight nine away from one, but you max out at like 14 if you can't get there.

531
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:20,833
Rym: Mm-hmm and Basically the way it works Mechanically.

532
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:28,290
Rym: other than that auction thing is what you place these little reservation things and when something comes out There's areas of the board numbers of squares.

533
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:30,609
Rym: They're sort of surrounded and they have a one or two next to them.

534
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:34,930
Rym: That means there can only be one or two things in that space.

535
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:51,050
Rym: so if Scott puts a Blocking tile on one of the spaces in a two area because he had a reservation thing there and I put my cart on Another one in that area Everything else in that entire area becomes roads and anyone else who had a reservation token there just gets kicked the fuck out.

536
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,350
Scott: So me and Rym we both put our reservation tokens in this area really close to the cheese.

537
00:32:55,993 --> 00:32:58,043
Scott: I win the cheese auction to put my cheese down.

538
00:32:58,104 --> 00:32:59,028
Scott: It's a one area.

539
00:32:59,772 --> 00:33:02,221
Scott: Now Rym loses his reservation token.

540
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:08,868
Scott: if another cheese auction happens that can be bad news bears for Rym who doesn't have any reservation tokens near the cheese now.

541
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:12,288
Scott: and If I lost the auction, oh bad for me.

542
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:12,807
Scott: Yeah.

543
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:18,267
Rym: So to make matters even worse the carts you put out or the blocking tiles you put out block.

544
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,270
Rym: you have to follow a road.

545
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:31,272
Rym: So we kind of played bastard mode where we had carts that were kind of trucks that were near each other Many games in a row a cart got entirely walled off from the entire board And you know what?

546
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:33,219
Rym: The answer is in this game max score.

547
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:33,419
Scott: Yep.

548
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,202
Rym: Fuck you.

549
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:38,118
Rym: Yeah the the answer to any question What if I do this is you're fucked?

550
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,043
Scott: Yeah, you can.

551
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:39,465
Scott: it's like what?

552
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:42,381
Scott: if I can't I can connect But I have to go off the edge of the board.

553
00:33:42,442 --> 00:33:43,730
Scott: It's like oh you can actually do that.

554
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:49,467
Scott: Yeah, it's two spaces for every edge of board space you use so that costs you like.

555
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,310
Scott: oh, it's max score.

556
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:51,140
Scott: You're too far away.

557
00:33:51,302 --> 00:33:55,038
Rym: this game Looks really simple like a light fun game.

558
00:33:55,059 --> 00:34:00,719
Rym: It is one of the most brutal like short multi It is I've ever played.

559
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:05,459
Scott: cutthroat ist of Placing carts and picnic flea market stand.

560
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:09,893
Rym: This is a. this is a game where four or five people will do a closed Fix fist auction.

561
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:17,277
Scott: everyone opens and everyone immediately closes all their fingers, but one yeah After seeing what the other people had in their hand.

562
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:21,690
Rym: the game has two phases effectively the posturing phase and the fucking phase.

563
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:24,041
Rym: There's really nothing else to this game.

564
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:25,449
Scott: fresh fish fuck.

565
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:31,181
Scott: So the thing about this game that I noticed though, is that I won.

566
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:38,023
Rym: every time I played I think I won a few times But I want to be times - I think I played twice in one.

567
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:40,973
Scott: twice every time you played I wanna I want.

568
00:34:40,993 --> 00:34:50,449
Scott: you did win more often than me anyway, but what I was doing to that made a difference was When I was putting my reservation tokens.

569
00:34:51,112 --> 00:35:04,090
Scott: I was trying to put them in such a way to where no auction result could fuck me and As long as I eventually got the auction which is gonna happen eventually at the end of the game every cart will have been placed.

570
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:08,230
Scott: No matter what I would have my cart in a good position.

571
00:35:08,752 --> 00:35:11,003
Scott: So that way I didn't have to bid a lot in the auctions.

572
00:35:11,023 --> 00:35:14,600
Scott: like a cheese auction would come up And I'd be like you know what if I won this cheese auction.

573
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,388
Scott: Yeah, that would be a good thing.

574
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:23,890
Scott: however If I lose the cheese auction It's not really gonna hurt me at all because I placed my marker in such a clever place that it's gonna get a good score.

575
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,458
Scott: However, I can't really be bumped out easily.

576
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,110
Rym: I saw you with that strategy, and it worked very well.

577
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:31,451
Scott: times.

578
00:35:31,652 --> 00:35:45,030
Rym: Anthony found a pretty good counter to that strategy by bagging earlier and putting markets out Blockers and just knocking my backup guy also off the board before the end of the game

579
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:45,531
Scott: Mm-hmm,

580
00:35:45,912 --> 00:35:51,410
Rym: and then I have got max score on two carts and lost by a lot instead of winning by a lot.

581
00:35:51,762 --> 00:36:09,670
Scott: Yeah So I was able to with my strategy Not have to bid a lot in the auctions and usually there would be one auction during the game where I couldn't avoid bidding a lot and I would bid a lot and I'd win that important auction and Then all of my carts would be like one two three not a lot of points at all And I just had a ridiculously good score.

582
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,643
Rym: Yeah, I'm the first time I played which I did win.

583
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:14,110
Rym: my strategy was well.

584
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:21,749
Rym: I've got these tokens if not now than when my goal is to spend all of them And it works really well.

585
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:22,288
Scott: It's yeah.

586
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:28,715
Scott: I mean if you spend all your tokens and you don't care about bidding a lot you're gonna have great placements and you usually Getting great placements.

587
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:36,830
Scott: your score is gonna be like less than five six something like that, but I have seen negative scores sure But you know that's a. that's a terrific score though in a four player game.

588
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,241
Scott: Right where someone's getting like a 15 on something in a five player game.

589
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:42,307
Rym: I saw one where someone won with like 13 like right?

590
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,910
Scott: Yeah, it's like you're gonna have one bad car is gives you ruin everything.

591
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:50,490
Scott: So, you know if you spend all your tokens you get four get all your carts in good positions.

592
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,394
Scott: That's a good score.

593
00:36:51,454 --> 00:36:56,679
Scott: if you get one bad position, but you didn't spend anything in the auctions That's also gonna be a good score.

594
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:00,809
Scott: All right, so there's a lot of different ways You can approach it and still turn out well.

595
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:08,159
Rym: But the real the game is real quick to teach real quick to play Really really satisfying.

596
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,450
Rym: there's some randomness elements to it.

597
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:11,335
Rym: Well

598
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,810
Scott: turn order matters a lot forgetting the good positions

599
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,678
Rym: but it is really

600
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:28,023
Scott: fun like the turn order actually helped me quite a bit because every time I had at the beginning of the game every time like a Position in mind like for my marker and every time I got to my turn 90% of the time that position was still open.

601
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:28,907
Scott: because turn order.

602
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:40,139
Rym: Yep But the game has a very high fun economy as in the amount of fun per minutes It takes to play is a very high value.

603
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:40,660
Rym: Mm-hmm.

604
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,262
Scott: That is true.

605
00:37:41,282 --> 00:37:43,970
Rym: And there's also so it's a Friedman freeze game.

606
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:46,149
Rym: So it actually has two versions of the rules.

607
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:51,290
Rym: We were playing the like newer updated version, but there is an older version more streamlined version.

608
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:59,741
Rym: Yeah The difference between the two is basically in the version that we were playing the one that most people would play When you fill a place then the roads go in.

609
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:04,397
Rym: but in the original weird rules It's kind of like battle line.

610
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:12,130
Rym: you only fill in roads by deduction By fruit like all places have to be connected to all places.

611
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:16,323
Rym: So once you show that they're like you have to place a road here or that breaks.

612
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:18,810
Rym: then roads start appearing and stuff starts happening.

613
00:38:19,011 --> 00:38:22,506
Rym: Yeah, we did not actually play that way because the proper way is great.

614
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:22,988
Scott: Mm-hmm.

615
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:30,989
Rym: So also the former way is kind of more diggish because in the in the ease in the older way in the very least Everything's connected.

616
00:38:31,594 --> 00:38:37,823
Rym: But the way we were playing with the newer rules You could very easily entirely wall something off and make the game horror.

617
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:46,507
Scott: very intentionally people would get picked flea market stands and line them up in a diagonal impossible to cross by any means so that it's like.

618
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:50,170
Scott: well the people on this Side of these flea market stands can have good scores on cheese.

619
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:57,886
Scott: Everyone who's done who isn't already on this side your cheese scores at minimum gonna be like eight And that's if you get that one spot there everyone else 15 get fine.

620
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:05,110
Rym: You're gonna look those other people in the eye as you place that cart Flipping them off and high-fiving the person who's on the good side with you.

621
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,135
Scott: I frequently.

622
00:39:06,315 --> 00:39:09,430
Scott: another part of my strategy was to specifically put markers and places.

623
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:18,030
Scott: I wanted a flea market stands Yeah, and then go in the bag and actively try to get flea market stands to fuck people up and it worked.

624
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:22,117
Rym: It's a super fun game If I would highly like.

625
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:24,667
Rym: it's also really tiny if you're a board gamer at all.

626
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:25,510
Rym: Just own it.

627
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,144
Rym: It's a perfect game to have in your repertoire like keeping and it's not like it doesn't?

628
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:30,850
Scott: it's not like any other game.

629
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:34,654
Scott: The closest game I can think to this would be Through the desert.

630
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:35,417
Scott: No.

631
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:36,882
Scott: Yeah, but it's not.

632
00:39:37,304 --> 00:39:38,629
Rym: it actually takes a long time, right?

633
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,134
Scott: It's not really even it's.

634
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:42,001
Scott: it's similar to through the desert, but it's not.

635
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:45,131
Scott: it's not close enough to where they're like displacing each other Right.

636
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:46,857
Scott: It's like there's no other game that you have.

637
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:51,695
Scott: that is like this game where you wouldn't want this on your shelf But through the desert takes.

638
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,890
Rym: so it takes twice as long to play as this game and it's not as good.

639
00:39:55,110 --> 00:40:04,345
Rym: Yeah, so like this is a kind of game that I would just carry in my backpack at a convention right alongside Like elk fest and those other little games that I carry around and wizard.

640
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:06,596
Scott: Mm-hmm There you go.

641
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:07,280
Scott: That's it.

642
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:08,949
Scott: fresh fish fresh fish.

643

Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
