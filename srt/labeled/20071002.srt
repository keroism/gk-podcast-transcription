1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,985
Scott: It's Tuesday October 2nd.

2
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:11,787
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:14,774
Scott: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:17,320
Scott: We discuss the burning wheel.

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,431
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:31,598
Scott: I beat that new Metroid game a few days ago.

7
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:33,160
Scott: Oh, did you yeah?

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,908
Rym: So um how was it?

9
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:36,620
Scott: it was the Metroid game?

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,736
Scott: What I don't know really it's it's weird like it's a fun game.

11
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:44,655
Scott: I played it I beat it, but this really does not much to say.

12
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:51,868
Rym: I mean well Imagine part of that because I remember you were showing Emily the end of Super Metroid And how it was such a better ending then.

13
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:54,377
Scott: Super Metroid is one of the best game endings that ever was.

14
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:56,980
Rym: I think it is Too because I remember just well.

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,080
Rym: I don't want to spoil it in case there's anyone out here who hasn't played that game, but yeah.

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:08,247
Scott: But I mean the end of the new Metroid is isn't really a spoiler, but it's like you beat the bad guys You win the end.

17
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:23,692
Scott: I mean, maybe I could have gotten a better ending with a hundred percent completion But I got over 75% completion and when I when I finally got the 75% completion the game popped up a message that said Congratulations, you're gonna get a better game ending than usual because you got 75%.

18
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:25,317
Scott: huh better, but not best.

19
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:28,839
Rym: They got to have some carrot for the hundred percenters.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,940
Scott: They must have some carrot out there, but I don't know if I'm gonna go for that carrot.

21
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:34,640
Scott: You know it's really not that hard.

22
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:41,089
Scott: I was looking like around the around the game And I don't think it would be too difficult to get a hundred percent complete When you could just look on YouTube.

23
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,760
Scott: yeah, I really wouldn't be worth it by looking YouTube.

24
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,402
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

25
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:50,180
Rym: there's the whole idea of better endings for getting a larger percentage of arbitrary secrets or arbitrary things.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,700
Rym: I just I lost patience with that like eight years ago.

27
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:04,100
Scott: Yes, if you want to do different endings the size just the end your only option is chrono trigger method Which is depending on how you beat the game?

28
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:13,489
Rym: Yeah, it has to be some sort of or Bioshock rational decision you make as opposed to just oh You got 49 of the BAF my dad's.

29
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,957
Rym: you're gonna get the ending where Dracula's hand comes up.

30
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:25,232
Rym: Oh Yeah, you know I never legitimately got anything But the worst ending in Castlevania 2 despite how many times you got any ending.

31
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:27,560
Scott: Castlevania 2. it's not worth playing that long.

32
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,465
Scott: It's awesome.

33
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:30,816
Scott: I don't know what that says me and that says angry.

34
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:31,319
Scott: video game.

35
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:38,020
Rym: nerd Castlevania 2 in my opinion sucks is the best Castlevania before Symphony of the night?

36
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:48,090
Scott: Because symphony Castlevania for the SNES super Castlevania is really good But it's like the best Castlevania before Symphony tonight.

37
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:49,957
Rym: Castlevania 2 was just so good.

38
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:52,997
Rym: No Not as good as I do.

39
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:55,648
Scott: No, you're just wrong.

40
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:01,109
Rym: Zelda - there was a good you tell me Mario - is better Mario 3 No, but it's better than Mario 1.

41
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:01,591
Scott: you suck.

42
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:03,459
Rym: I like Mario 1 I think Mario -.

43
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,579
Scott: oh I think the lost levels are on the virtual console.

44
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,208
Scott: now I'm gonna go check it all hot cuz.

45
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:11,451
Scott: I have them on the Game Boy Color But that's kind of hard to play with my Diaz.

46
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,200
Rym: see that's how they get us.

47
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:15,075
Scott: I know that's how they get us plus I don't know it.

48
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:19,759
Rym: I'm not gonna buy every virtual console game because I do feel like it's kind of a ripoff to buy them all.

49
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,069
Rym: but There's some games where I feel like.

50
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:24,040
Rym: that is now the definitive version.

51
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,290
Rym: It's just so perfect like Mario 1 on the Wii is amazing.

52
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:27,792
Rym: Yep.

53
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:36,058
Rym: It's better than Mario 1 and anywhere else Especially if it's the original lost levels and not that kind of re graphic crap.

54
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:41,178
Scott: remake Yep, so to make up for the fact that the the match the new Wii.

55
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:47,477
Scott: Metroid Corruption was a good game overall, but not too exciting in any particular way.

56
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:56,780
Scott: once it's finished Playing Super Metroid virtual console Yeah, I noticed that when I came home a much better game than pretty much every other game ever.

57
00:03:57,502 --> 00:04:01,555
Scott: It's like if you look at like the top best games ever at least single-player games.

58
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:10,513
Scott: It's like Half-Life Half-Life 2 Super Metroid Some people say Bioshock maybe System Shock 2 maybe.

59
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:15,760
Scott: yeah, I've not barely played it so far But I've played it more than zero which is what how much I played it a few weeks ago.

60
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,339
Scott: Yeah, oh well see a Super Metroid.

61
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:19,726
Scott: Play that.

62
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:28,482
Rym: so in the news And I mean there's probably legitimate or interesting news out there in regards to the 50 games and the board game I can't.

63
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,108
Scott: well halo 3 whatever.

64
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:31,071
Scott: I can't find.

65
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:36,639
Rym: I think we already said that halo 3 came out and What else could I say other than that it came out?

66
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:42,100
Rym: And I believe a lot of people are getting the ring of death probably because they're suddenly using their x-boxes again.

67
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:45,188
Scott: My boss actually has an Xbox.

68
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:49,601
Scott: he used it to play the Gears of War and now he's gonna use it to play halo 3.

69
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,444
Scott: Wow ever used it.

70
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,652
Rym: Otherwise see honestly find an Xbox.

71
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,499
Rym: I probably would just be playing Carcassonne.

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,754
Scott: Yeah, that live arcade is pretty much all of you do.

73
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:01,341
Scott: I'm playing Uno with the webcam Carcassonne.

74
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:06,736
Rym: if they ever set it up like if they said alright Xbox Live Arcade is now available on Vista.

75
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:09,846
Rym: I would upgrade That second.

76
00:05:10,248 --> 00:05:12,196
Rym: maybe I would teleport into a best buy.

77
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:13,099
Scott: that's how much it was.

78
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:16,510
Rym: I'd be willing to pay almost as much as an Xbox.

79
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:21,389
Scott: people are actually starting to be pretty hard on Vista like Listen to the most recent twit.

80
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:27,699
Scott: I know I know and they were talking like They were talking that like they were treating Vista like Windows ME.

81
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,666
Scott: See, it's pretty harsh.

82
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:31,474
Rym: Did they have anything legitimate?

83
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,140
Rym: because I mean this is not great.

84
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:34,640
Rym: I'm not gonna say it's pretty much there.

85
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:40,059
Scott: One of the guys on the show wrote a really good article and I didn't read the article so I don't know.

86
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:44,100
Rym: I mean basically the only reason I use Windows anyway is for gaming.

87
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:47,554
Rym: So if gaming goes to Vista, I'm going to Vista.

88
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:49,824
Rym: if gaming skips Vista I'm skipping Vista.

89
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:51,510
Scott: basically the thing is right now.

90
00:05:52,233 --> 00:06:02,958
Scott: if you want DirectX 10 you need Vista but in terms of most games in general what people seem to say is that the performance is worse on Vista and Vista doesn't really do anything that Windows XP doesn't do.

91
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:08,540
Rym: Well, one thing it does very well is not be fully patched and ready and tested.

92
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,056
Rym: Yeah, yeah, I guess right but I gotta talk about this.

93
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,020
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about it much.

94
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,714
Rym: It's kind of like when the Wii name was announced.

95
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:17,197
Rym: it ever went.

96
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:21,614
Scott: Oh my god It made Wii jokes and now everyone calls it Wii and doesn't even think about revolution.

97
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,380
Rym: I know I tried so hard.

98
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,283
Rym: I remember when it came out.

99
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:27,772
Rym: I was like, no one's gonna call it the physical plant capstone.

100
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:31,864
Scott: I'm calling it the Phoenix Firebird Fire something.

101
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:39,902
Rym: yeah, I'm gonna call it the revolution because that would seem so cool, you know the revolution the Nintendo Revolution Wii.

102
00:06:40,284 --> 00:06:40,767
Rym: it's the Wii.

103
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:41,672
Rym: it's over.

104
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:45,288
Scott: Anyway, so Nintendo you fought the good fight.

105
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:48,559
Rym: I thought you thought you second you fought the fight not as long as me.

106
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,632
Rym: So apparently and this is all over the news.

107
00:06:52,692 --> 00:07:02,440
Rym: This shouldn't be news to anyone Nintendo is going to be packaging and giving away with all the new systems or all the new controllers a Big rubber condom for the wiimotes.

108
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:08,059
Scott: Yep, I mean first they made the strap then they made a better strap and a better strap and a better strap.

109
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:17,169
Scott: first They made the strap and now they in the best possible strap, I guess with also a Wii condom No remote condom.

110
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:19,339
Rym: What bothers me is that?

111
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:22,890
Rym: Anyone could find fault with the original strap.

112
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,797
Rym: Do you understand the sheer?

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,639
Rym: Misuse you would have to apply yourself to to break that strap.

114
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:30,822
Scott: Mm-hmm.

115
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:35,760
Rym: No, it's impossible for an intelligent human being to let go of a wiimote.

116
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:38,870
Rym: Yep, let alone break that strap.

117
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:39,672
Scott: Yep.

118
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:41,940
Scott: Obviously they weren't wearing the strap first of all.

119
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:47,658
Rym: Yeah, but remember a lot of people claim that yeah the strap broke even though I believe most of those people were lying.

120
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:48,039
Rym: Mm-hmm.

121
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:52,275
Rym: But yeah, a lot of people are talking, you know, why would Nintendo do this?

122
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:53,360
Rym: or it looks dumb or it look.

123
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:54,424
Rym: It doesn't matter.

124
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:56,192
Rym: most people aren't gonna use this.

125
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:58,240
Rym: you know, why Nintendo is releasing this?

126
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,940
Rym: I'm gonna let you all in on a little secret that you may or may not realize.

127
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:10,520
Rym: This is nothing more than Nintendo saying see we did our due diligence And now you can't sue us if you break your big-screen TV, and yeah, yeah.

128
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:13,860
Scott: Well, I think a lot of that stuff about you know, people break in wiim.

129
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,972
Scott: You know their TVs at their wiimotes early on was a lot of.

130
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:31,460
Scott: it was greatly over exaggerated But regardless it created sort of a PR problem for Nintendo and Nintendo is very smart and they realize that the number one Most important thing to making money is not having a good product not having anything else.

131
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,780
Scott: The number one most important thing to making a lot of money in big business is public relations.

132
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:39,900
Scott: So they said hey is the most important thing if we have bad public relations?

133
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:42,428
Scott: You know and there's bad stories about us in the news.

134
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:42,929
Scott: We're done.

135
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:45,639
Scott: So they did everything they possibly could.

136
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,299
Scott: they don't care How much money it costs to fix that and they did fix that and now they're going.

137
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:57,748
Rym: ah Money, I have seen some people make the comment that it looks like I mean It would make the wiimote a little bit thicker feeling.

138
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,970
Rym: if you have big hands or you feel like the remotes flimsy It might just make it feel better in your hand.

139
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:03,633
Scott: It might.

140
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,280
Scott: I could see that we can get them.

141
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,661
Scott: They're free.

142
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:06,264
Scott: You want to get them?

143
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:07,649
Rym: I figure we should get them.

144
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,360
Rym: if something is free, you know tragedy the Commons.

145
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:11,411
Rym: Let's go right in there.

146
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,850
Scott: All right I'll go fill out the thing and get him for free because I never.

147
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:18,385
Scott: I'm still using the original straps from the because we got The Wii day one.

148
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:20,074
Scott: so I have the original straps.

149
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:21,140
Scott: We can get the new ones.

150
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:22,872
Rym: I've never put the strap around my wrist.

151
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:24,059
Scott: I always use the strip.

152
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:24,784
Rym: I just don't.

153
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:30,400
Rym: if I ever own my own wiimote Which I will once they make a special wiimote so I can be all cool.

154
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,364
Scott: I don't know if they're ever gonna.

155
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:35,280
Rym: someday they will you know, they will and I'll get some black or pink wiimote.

156
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:37,354
Rym: I'm not gonna put the strap on it.

157
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:38,200
Rym: I'm a rebel.

158
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,640
Scott: Yeah, one day you're gonna be playing WarioWare or something in there.

159
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,955
Rym: Oh, yeah, cuz I'm ever gonna play WarioWare for the fucking Wii again.

160
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,080
Rym: That was the best game ever.

161
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,371
Scott: Everybody come out with another one.

162
00:09:47,614 --> 00:09:48,279
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

163
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,082
Rym: They're probably.

164
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:55,040
Rym: I mean remember WarioWare for the GameCube was such a fluke and they don't understand why it was a good game.

165
00:09:55,683 --> 00:09:59,460
Rym: I'm not convinced that Nintendo will ever realize why that WarioWare was a good game.

166
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:01,839
Scott: I just think they don't think about and they don't care.

167
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:10,456
Rym: Hence, I highly doubt that I will ever play a WarioWare game again Except WarioWare for the GameCube, which for a long time was the best game on the Wii.

168
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:16,409
Scott: All right So, you know Gabe Newell He's like one of the co-founders of valve.

169
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:17,835
Rym: I've heard the name.

170
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:18,940
Rym: I don't really pay attention.

171
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:24,700
Scott: Yeah, he's like the valve guy, you know, he's pretty famous, you know, he's responsible for all those awesome valve games.

172
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:26,599
Scott: There was a pretty big interview with him.

173
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:38,121
Scott: Of course, they're gonna be many interviews with him in the coming times because you know Orange box like biggest game has you know hard it is to not make every Tuesday be about Team Fortress 2?

174
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,727
Scott: I know right and I'm pre.

175
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:48,284
Scott: I'm pre downloading a portal right now and They ask him a bunch of questions about various things here and there, you know He kind of looks.

176
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:51,919
Scott: actually I've never seen a picture of him before but this interview has a picture of him, huh?

177
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:54,443
Scott: He looks like Newman Really?

178
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:57,539
Scott: Yeah, kinda huh only with different color hair, huh?

179
00:10:58,262 --> 00:11:02,978
Scott: But anyway, one of the questions they ask him is they ask him how come he's not making games for OS X?

180
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,185
Scott: and first of All I'm pissed.

181
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,907
Scott: They didn't ask about Linux ass But you know that is true.

182
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,030
Scott: Why isn't all the?

183
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,455
Scott: why isn't steam on OS X?

184
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:11,780
Scott: that would totally rock the house.

185
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:14,708
Scott: I would buy a Mac probably.

186
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:17,800
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna get cuz I didn't read this article at all.

187
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:18,990
Rym: I'm gonna guess.

188
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:20,422
Rym: the answer is Not.

189
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:24,399
Rym: many people have max and the kinds of people who have max and not the kinds of people are gonna play steam games.

190
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:25,503
Scott: not Even close, huh?

191
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,308
Scott: So he's talked.

192
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:33,660
Scott: they valve has been in talks with Apple before right and they said hey We're thinking about making games for the Mac.

193
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:40,267
Scott: We want to move all our stuff over there and Apple, you know, whenever they've talked to Apple He said is according to him right?

194
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,796
Scott: He says well, you wanted to read the paragraph.

195
00:11:43,257 --> 00:11:44,283
Rym: I didn't read anything All right.

196
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:45,192
Scott: I'll read the paragraph.

197
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:45,859
Rym: I go for it.

198
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,140
Scott: This is this is a direct quote from Gabe Newell via this interview.

199
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:56,119
Scott: Alright we tried to have a conversation with Apple for several years and they never seemed to dot dot dot.

200
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:58,827
Scott: Well, we have this pattern with Apple.

201
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:00,994
Scott: where we meet with them people there go.

202
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:03,100
Scott: Wow gaming is incredibly important.

203
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,913
Scott: We should do something with gaming and then we'll say Okay, here are three things you could do to make that better.

204
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,246
Scott: and then they say, okay and then we never see them again.

205
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:16,319
Scott: and then a year later a new group of people show up who apparently have no idea.

206
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:19,560
Scott: the Last group of people were there and never followed through on anything.

207
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:25,279
Scott: So they seem to think that they want to do gaming But there's never any follow-through and any of the things that they say they're gonna do.

208
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:29,660
Scott: That makes it hard to be excited about doing games for their platforms, huh?

209
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:38,125
Scott: So you like he's probably like, you know There's the Apple people come to talk to the valve people and the valve people are like, okay We'll make games for your system.

210
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:42,940
Scott: You need to you know implement this sort of thing, you know in the in the OS.

211
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:50,040
Scott: So it's easier for us to program the games and you need to implement some sort of joystick Handling because OS X is no joystick handling whatsoever.

212
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:59,600
Rym: That is that's probably my biggest complaint is that if I want to use an emulator on a Mac I gotta pay someone for something that should just be working automatically in the system.

213
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:10,218
Scott: Yep, and they're like they're probably telling them, you know all the things that they need in OS X to make game development feasible and profitable in a reasonable amount of time.

214
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:21,980
Scott: and The people they talk to were like, yeah, that sounds great because they're thinking yeah games on OS X people switch over from Windows They'll be awesome and they're right and then they probably go back and Steve Jobs is like what the fuck you talking about?

215
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,811
Scott: Yeah, but they're not doing that shit and it.

216
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:29,362
Scott: they just don't do it and no one pushes them to do it and they don't think about it.

217
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:35,098
Scott: and people say Steve Jobs hates games and there's no evidence of that, but I believe it.

218
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:37,360
Rym: I It's a common practice.

219
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:45,385
Scott: if you don't want something done is OS X basically has nothing in it to support game developers or game players and You kind of need.

220
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:46,548
Rym: I just can't imagine why.

221
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:49,377
Rym: because there are a lot of people like me.

222
00:13:49,638 --> 00:13:54,540
Scott: people are using Bootcamp to put windows on their power books to play world.

223
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:05,150
Rym: well World of Warcraft runs on the Mac but if I other games besides the world the only reason I didn't just use that Mac that I bought as a Computer for me was that I couldn't podcast on it.

224
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:10,134
Rym: if I weren't a podcaster you can bet your ass I'd be using a Mac if I could play steam games on it.

225
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,395
Rym: Yep Then I get a DM which is like the best I am client in the world.

226
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:15,158
Scott: Yeah, it sure is.

227
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,376
Scott: I mean kop I've been using is the second best but adm is just so hot.

228
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:20,180
Scott: adm is hot.

229
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,049
Scott: But well, you know the Mac it's like, you know, it.

230
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:27,539
Scott: it does stuff and for people who don't do things It doesn't do it's great.

231
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:35,705
Scott: Don't do what Donnie don't when you do something like play team fortress 2 or if you do something like Program things.

232
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,331
Scott: Well, I guess he it does that but it doesn't.

233
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:41,204
Scott: you know, it's not as comfortable as yes podcast It's your podcast.

234
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:46,984
Scott: The Mac is no good and it's like, you know for the general everyday tasks It's just fine.

235
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:48,792
Scott: But then again, so is Ubuntu.

236
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,399
Scott: So why spend the extra money on the Mac?

237
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,034
Rym: Yeah, I mean I like Macs, but I look at how much it costs to get a Mac.

238
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,419
Rym: That's as fast as my current PC.

239
00:14:57,881 --> 00:14:58,563
Rym: It's crazy.

240
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:03,155
Scott: Yep, and it doesn't do things that but less expensive computers do.

241
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:03,797
Rym: well it does.

242
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,190
Scott: if I use boot camp I guess which means you got to pay for windows.

243
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,870
Rym: Anyway, well pay is one word One word.

244
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,879
Scott: Yes pay is a word.

245
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:17,240
Scott: But yeah, I think that was pretty interesting because it's sort of not quite.

246
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:20,700
Scott: I mean, it's not some sort of unobvious surprise that that's that.

247
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,945
Scott: That's what he would say, but it's not what immediately you would think is, you know Why are there no games on the Mac?

248
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:34,420
Scott: Well because Mac people don't play games because no it's because The Apple people just don't put the stuff in OS X that that people need to make games.

249
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,920
Scott: I mean you could start arguments about well Blizzard gets their games on the Mac, you know, blah blah blah.

250
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:40,344
Scott: I think that's just cuz.

251
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:42,130
Scott: Blizzard makes a lot fewer games.

252
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:43,875
Scott: They're not making steam.

253
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:48,550
Scott: They're just making games and They spend a lot of time on their games.

254
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,140
Scott: and their games are like they make a few really big games.

255
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:58,582
Scott: So they could push they can get them on the Mac, but valve makes more games and they're mostly DirectX games Plus.

256
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:02,863
Rym: think about how many more people play World of Warcraft than any other game I know.

257
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,579
Scott: I know part of that could be because the Macness.

258
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:20,970
Rym: Now I think part of that is just because a lot of people just have this need to play a game like that and of Those games while I think those games like I think I've outgrown that kind of game and I personally find those games really dumb World of Warcraft is the best one far away.

259
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:23,278
Rym: Yes better than any game like that has ever been.

260
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,988
Scott: also Like the graphics in World of Warcraft.

261
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:27,574
Scott: It's it's not like an FPS.

262
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:29,300
Scott: We have some advanced graphical engine.

263
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:31,280
Scott: They're pretty standard 3d graphics.

264
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:31,902
Scott: You know, it does.

265
00:16:32,103 --> 00:16:35,635
Scott: you could run World of Warcraft on really crap computers relatively speaking.

266
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:41,070
Scott: We can't run Half-Life 2 2 on a semi crap.

267
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,722
Rym: I was shocked barely runs on my computer Exactly.

268
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:47,692
Rym: Actually, I got it to run great after I turned off a lot of the.

269
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:49,800
Rym: I can't while I like the eye candy.

270
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:54,199
Rym: The game was unplayable and once I turned it off the game played great to beat it.

271
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:58,311
Rym: yet I've played maybe two hours of Bioshock.

272
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:00,699
Scott: I heard it's only like a ten hour game or so.

273
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,165
Rym: remember I got Bioshock.

274
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:03,090
Rym: I started playing it.

275
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:04,135
Rym: It was awesome.

276
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:09,395
Rym: I killed the doctor I started moving on and then Team Fortress 2 came out.

277
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:10,640
Scott: How many doctors did you kill then?

278
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:12,237
Rym: You know what?

279
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,406
Rym: Fuck those doctors.

280
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,435
Rym: I think I'm the only person.

281
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:17,579
Rym: despite that penny arcade.

282
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,400
Rym: I think I'm the only person who actually shoots the doctor.

283
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:22,253
Scott: I try to shoot the doctor, but it seems like late.

284
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:25,244
Scott: like the past two days I've been trying to shoot the doctor right?

285
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:28,051
Scott: He fucking turns invincible every time.

286
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:29,336
Scott: Oh fuck you.

287
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,840
Scott: What's with your timing you doctor?

288
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,546
Rym: Before we get on to the things today.

289
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:38,764
Rym: I just remembered something happened in Team Fortress 2 that I Got.

290
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:39,720
Scott: I'm talking about this game.

291
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,585
Rym: I got to get this out because this is so brilliant and I Enjoyed this thoroughly.

292
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:48,820
Rym: So, you know most servers in Team Fortress 2 have the voice chat like shared between teams.

293
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:49,868
Rym: Everyone can hear everyone.

294
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:51,057
Scott: some of them do.

295
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:53,509
Scott: Yeah Like you and that I hate that.

296
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,099
Rym: but most of the ones I play on are that way.

297
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,686
Rym: No, a lot of people don't realize it.

298
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:59,760
Rym: So I'm on one server and this one guy keeps talking to his team.

299
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,607
Rym: He's like, alright, I'm a scout.

300
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:02,350
Rym: I'm gonna go in.

301
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:06,670
Rym: Alright, we're setting up a century in their sewer Don't don't bla bla bla.

302
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:07,960
Rym: and we're just listening for a while.

303
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,031
Rym: And finally someone on his team is like, ah, dude, they can all hear you STFU.

304
00:18:14,923 --> 00:18:15,449
Rym: It's alright.

305
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,747
Rym: I Laugh at that and I keep playing.

306
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:27,015
Rym: and then you know four or five games go by and there's a lot of turnover the people and then I think a minute and I start doing the same thing for a little while be your lion.

307
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:28,239
Rym: Well, I'm not lying.

308
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:36,320
Rym: at first I'm just kind of say I'm acting like I don't know and I'm a sniper and I'm fighting against these two other snipers that are really fucking good and having trouble with them.

309
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,908
Rym: And it's this really close, you know across the team the two fort.

310
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:44,633
Rym: and then I just say oh man, I'm up here I'm just I'm just guys.

311
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:54,518
Rym: as a sniper I'm gonna take out this other sniper and then we can all rush and the sniper shot each other and both snipers turn and look At each other and start like maneuvering and shooting and I just picked them both off.

312
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,425
Scott: nice It's very nice.

313
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:58,830
Rym: I was so proud of.

314
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:04,628
Scott: that is the way that you do the Sun Tzu And see how I threw that in there.

315
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:05,592
Scott: cuz you know the soldier.

316
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:06,154
Rym: Yes.

317
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:06,736
Rym: Yes.

318
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:15,886
Rym: That was quite good Things of the day.

319
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,111
Rym: so check this.

320
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:19,040
Rym: this guy or guys.

321
00:19:19,161 --> 00:19:22,100
Rym: I didn't really read the article because I don't care why they did it.

322
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,598
Rym: It was some sort of art project and I all I care about is what they did.

323
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:28,059
Rym: Apparently they got away with it for a long time.

324
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:36,107
Rym: These dudes went up dressed as workmen and I guess one of them stood there with a clipboard or something because you know a clipboard Makes anything look legitimate.

325
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:39,740
Rym: you could walk into any company with a clipboard and just walk out with just about anything you want.

326
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:42,410
Scott: So that's the ultimate hacking right there.

327
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:42,732
Rym: Yep.

328
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:44,860
Rym: So have we talked about social engineering?

329
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,705
Scott: I think so at some level.

330
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:47,568
Rym: regardless.

331
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,720
Rym: if you ever need to get away with something shady carry a clipboard.

332
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,625
Rym: You'll probably get away.

333
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:52,550
Rym: but that's beside the point.

334
00:19:53,154 --> 00:20:00,260
Scott: name badge name tag Yep, especially if it's fancy looking and the logo on your name tag matches logo on your clipboard papers your set.

335
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:08,206
Rym: Oh if you have a letterhead, oh man Yeah, and some sort of scribbly signature at the bottom of a complicated looking requisition form They just make it in Microsoft Word.

336
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,176
Rym: Yeah with really small print and it could be a lorem ipsum.

337
00:20:11,197 --> 00:20:12,206
Rym: They're not gonna read it Yep.

338
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:21,411
Rym: Anyway, so these guys built an apartment out of cinder blocks and fully furnished it Inside of the parking lot of a mall.

339
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:23,399
Rym: Oh man and proceeded to live in it.

340
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:25,340
Rym: It didn't have running water.

341
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:28,840
Rym: So they had to use the mall bathrooms and I guess they went somewhere to shower.

342
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:33,380
Rym: But they had power in a PlayStation 2 and just a full furniture.

343
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:46,159
Rym: Oh my god, and I just think that's so cool because that's always been a tiny fantasy of mine especially when I was younger just a Setting up a tree for it, but not in a tree but somewhere awesome like in the middle of someone else's house.

344
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:47,565
Scott: Yeah, it's it.

345
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:50,980
Scott: secret compartments and secret places are like way cool.

346
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:55,095
Rym: Yeah, if I ever build a house you can bet your ass there's gonna be a secret passage.

347
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:56,380
Scott: Oh secret passages.

348
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:58,488
Rym: Oh, yeah, secret room.

349
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,432
Rym: No you walk out.

350
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:01,300
Rym: All right, so our house right you're gonna walk into it.

351
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,163
Rym: You open the front door.

352
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:04,411
Rym: There's a foyer and that's it.

353
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,820
Scott: You have to open the skull and take the key out.

354
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,052
Rym: I Wouldn't want to live in Shadowgate.

355
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,199
Rym: That's not a happy place.

356
00:21:12,402 --> 00:21:14,677
Scott: Our house is like a hundred doors and a sphinx.

357
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:21,020
Rym: Every one of them is dead and a lake of fire and a sphere behind every door is death and a lawsuit.

358
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:25,533
Rym: Oh That's that's all I got to say about this.

359
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:26,139
Rym: this is just cool.

360
00:21:26,742 --> 00:21:36,000
Scott: Okay, so BB spot if you if you don't know BB spot is a funny nerd Kind of satire site that makes up funny fake news stories and stuff like that.

361
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,328
Rym: It also used to be a very good source of Thing of the day type things before.

362
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:42,838
Rym: sites like Fark and dig really just took over for that.

363
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,259
Scott: Yep So they put up today a should I stop playing this game?

364
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:52,890
Scott: Matrix for Mary a decision matrix for married folks.

365
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,879
Rym: right decision matrix is otherwise known as an expert system.

366
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:08,708
Scott: Yep It's basically a series of questions and you answer them Yes or no And you eventually you keep it points you with arrows to what question you should answer next and eventually it leaves you with an answer To your cut to your situation.

367
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,660
Rym: It's basically a decision-making system.

368
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:20,110
Rym: It's very useful in a corporate setting if you want to say have employees execute a process and do make decisions But you don't want them to have any discretion.

369
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:20,713
Scott: Yep.

370
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:21,637
Scott: All right, so you wanted.

371
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:22,299
Scott: do you want to do this?

372
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:23,623
Rym: All right, I'll do it.

373
00:22:23,663 --> 00:22:24,867
Scott: All right, pretend you're married.

374
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:25,911
Rym: All right, I'm married.

375
00:22:26,031 --> 00:22:28,660
Scott: Okay, should you stop playing the game?

376
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,503
Scott: That is the question.

377
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,009
Rym: No, no, no, wait.

378
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,495
Scott: Okay, so hit the first quote.

379
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:33,660
Scott: That is the main question.

380
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,724
Scott: Oh, it doesn't matter what game.

381
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:37,918
Rym: we can just make up a game or pretend pretend whatever you want.

382
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:39,947
Rym: All right I'm playing a Custer's revenge.

383
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,011
Rym: No, no cat house blues.

384
00:22:41,212 --> 00:22:43,000
Scott: All right is the spouse home?

385
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,640
Scott: Yes, is the spouse asleep?

386
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:50,210
Scott: Sure, is there work in the morning?

387
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:53,099
Scott: Yeah, you have any sick days left.

388
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:54,269
Rym: Yep.

389
00:22:54,693 --> 00:22:55,279
Scott: Keep playing.

390
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:04,640
Rym: You know what that sort of decision matrix is the kind of loop that is going on in my head all the time.

391
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,704
Scott: You want to do another one?

392
00:23:05,945 --> 00:23:06,266
Scott: All right.

393
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:06,627
Scott: All right.

394
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:07,330
Scott: Should I start?

395
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,293
Scott: should you stop playing?

396
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:09,197
Scott: is the spouse home?

397
00:23:09,378 --> 00:23:09,899
Rym: Let's say no.

398
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:12,471
Scott: Why are you asking for what?

399
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,400
Rym: if I work tomorrow it doesn't matter.

400
00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:19,573
Rym: See the only thing is I I will say this and I'm not.

401
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:21,320
Rym: that is a little bit sexy.

402
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:28,738
Rym: Well, I guess not sexist because it's a spouse it doesn't die But at the same time you shouldn't be marrying someone who disrespects your hobbies.

403
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:29,380
Scott: That's right.

404
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,765
Scott: We've talked about that many a time.

405
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:30,986
Scott: Yes.

406
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:33,395
Rym: Dave Riley is perhaps the expert on this subject.

407
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:39,298
Scott: Dave Riley is Definitely our brother in arms when it comes to the topic at hand.

408
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:42,512
Rym: Yes It's not bros before hoes.

409
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:43,780
Rym: It's hoes should be bros.

410
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:54,919
Scott: So you're gay Right, so anyway There you go forum that that's your fill for the day.

411
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,711
Rym: You know someday they're gonna wonder if we do this on purpose or not.

412
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:04,352
Rym: and sometimes yes sometimes no We swing both ways.

413
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:08,888
Scott: Oh That was obviously yes on purpose, okay, right.

414
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:13,640
Rym: so way back we interviewed a man named Luke crane.

415
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:20,987
Scott: He is the designer and primary author of the burning wheel Tabletop role-playing game system.

416
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:25,280
Rym: The man is a tiny god and I highly recommend you listen to Scott's interview with him.

417
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,280
Rym: I say Scott because back then we didn't know so much about audio and I was kind of drunk.

418
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,570
Rym: So Scott conducted the inner very drunk.

419
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,700
Rym: that drunk pretty drunk now.

420
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:35,446
Scott: But the thing was we're gonna drive home.

421
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:36,711
Rym: Of course not.

422
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,883
Rym: but well partly because of that fucking blizzard I was different.

423
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:47,240
Rym: that was the time before I was but I was sitting there dealing with the fact that Luke crane for the life Of him cannot use a microphone.

424
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:50,960
Scott: Well, the man gestures a lot and moves around a lot and he's very energetic.

425
00:24:51,101 --> 00:24:54,480
Scott: So a microphone on a stand sitting in front of him was not gonna.

426
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:57,793
Rym: I felt like I would had to just stand behind him holding the microphone in his.

427
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,700
Scott: he needs a boom guy or a lavalier?

428
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:00,484
Rym: Yes, he does.

429
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:03,339
Rym: But anyway aura or a boundary that guy.

430
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:10,157
Rym: There's a lot of insight to be had about role-playing and what is good about role-playing and why people really role-play.

431
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:13,276
Rym: and you know We talked a while ago about you know, whining gamers.

432
00:25:13,316 --> 00:25:15,686
Rym: now a lot of times They don't understand the games they whine about.

433
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:19,800
Rym: as a result the suggestions they make a Luke crane is an example of the opposite of that.

434
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:25,759
Rym: He knows more about role-playing than most people and he's put a lot more thought of it into it than most people have.

435
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,040
Rym: and as a

436
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:28,880
Scott: Lot of help from other people who've also put a lot of yes

437
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,440
Rym: I believe he even used the words, you know standing on the shoulders of Giants Yeah

438
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:32,761
Scott: But

439
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:48,762
Rym: the guy if you listen to him and the way he's you'll probably end up having a lot more fun playing games like Dungeons & Dragons or any role-playing game because you'll start to kind of think about What you like about role-playing and what you don't like and how you can get rid of the things you don't like and just do The things you like.

440
00:25:49,223 --> 00:26:06,563
Scott: and despite us being total Luke crane fanboys and playing with you know in his games at conventions And talking to him and interviewing him and buying his books and reading his books We never actually played that much burning wheel and he would always tell us just play it just play it and I'd be like It's.

441
00:26:06,864 --> 00:26:10,220
Scott: it seems hard like it's a daunting task to try to play it.

442
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,023
Scott: You know and I don't feel like it'll be right and I like I'll mess it up and cuz we were.

443
00:26:14,063 --> 00:26:16,636
Rym: so I mean the way he runs burning wheel is amazing.

444
00:26:16,656 --> 00:26:22,760
Rym: and if you ever Ever at a convention a gaming convention where Luke crane is there or even anyone named Luke crane?

445
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,171
Rym: Cuz even if it's not him, you got to take that chance.

446
00:26:25,432 --> 00:26:25,593
Rym: Yep.

447
00:26:25,914 --> 00:26:28,970
Rym: Just sign up for whatever event He's running and see what happens.

448
00:26:29,392 --> 00:26:30,699
Rym: I guarantee you'll have a good time

449
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:31,523
Scott: Mm-hmm,

450
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:43,293
Rym: but we took all his other advice and we tried all those games He talked about and we read about him and we do, you know, we everything he said we thought about Except the final piece of advice which was just fucking play it.

451
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:44,597
Scott: That's all in my game.

452
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:45,420
Scott: You bought my game.

453
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,530
Scott: Why aren't you playing my game?

454
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,700
Rym: Yeah, don't think about it.

455
00:26:48,222 --> 00:26:50,087
Scott: D&D even though he loved his game.

456
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:53,638
Scott: I'm it was sort of like it felt sort of like this communism thing.

457
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:54,220
Scott: We're on paper.

458
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,196
Scott: I loved it, but I didn't feel like I could make it happen.

459
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:57,880
Scott: So I didn't do it.

460
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,968
Scott: I just kept playing D&D.

461
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:00,740
Rym: It also didn't help that we have capitalism.

462
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:07,320
Rym: We have a large gaming group and the majority of the people in our group aren't even that well versed in Dungeons & Dragons.

463
00:27:07,923 --> 00:27:10,780
Rym: So switching them to burning wheel didn't seem like it would be easy.

464
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:12,998
Scott: No, it definitely seemed like it was gonna be hard.

465
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,013
Rym: granted The answer is it is really hard, but we'll get to that.

466
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,440
Scott: It was really hard for us.

467
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,620
Scott: No, not for us, but but it was difficult and there were some hurdles to jump over.

468
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:36,793
Rym: but a lot of you who listen to that interviewer here is talk every now and then about burning wheel and especially many of you who have been participants in the various forum arguments about burning wheel and Especially after we did that show on why we really don't like Dungeons & Dragons anymore.

469
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:38,137
Scott: Oh, I remember that.

470
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:42,291
Scott: wow that Why it sort of makes this show feel redundant in a way.

471
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,560
Rym: Well, yeah, because I think this will be more anecdotes.

472
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,904
Rym: It's real-world experience.

473
00:27:46,085 --> 00:27:49,878
Rym: Yeah, like the previous show was the theory like here's why we think we like burning wheel.

474
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:50,520
Rym: now.

475
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:52,873
Rym: It's now that we forced ourselves to play.

476
00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:56,966
Scott: We haven't played it that much though We've played it like one or two times but we put a lot of thought into it.

477
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:04,350
Rym: and also because we're converting a D&D game over we've Discovered all the things that work and don't work and we've.

478
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:07,160
Rym: we learned a lot of things and I guess we'll just get right.

479
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,330
Scott: Yeah, we've begun to learn.

480
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,774
Scott: we haven't learned the whole yet No, but we have learned more than before but not the fullness.

481
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:16,807
Scott: we have not grok it Not grokking the fullness.

482
00:28:16,907 --> 00:28:24,196
Rym: Yeah, we'll need to share some water with all of you later, but But we took the plunge and you've all been asking.

483
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:24,759
Rym: so here it is.

484
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:36,719
Rym: we have tried to convert our Dungeons & Dragons campaign to burning wheel partly because I Took the initiative and said all right fuckers I'm running my burning wheel game the one I've been talking about for like a year.

485
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:40,020
Rym: You know the Horatio Hornblower ships captain blah blah blah awesome.

486
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:44,498
Rym: And then you know about to play D&D and we're all talking about burning wheel.

487
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,752
Rym: and Eventually, the consensus was reached fuck D&D it sucks and we hate it.

488
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:49,796
Rym: Mm-hmm.

489
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:52,545
Rym: So we said, all right What are we gonna do?

490
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:56,680
Rym: and Alex our DM said, you know what burn your characters?

491
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:07,634
Scott: We're switching tomorrow and we spent basically two days figuring the game out and sitting around making characters and Discussing and talking and moving and shaking without even playing.

492
00:29:07,674 --> 00:29:12,291
Scott: we just spent like two days Pretty much all day most of the day working on it.

493
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:23,906
Rym: now before we get into all the things that happen I don't want this to be an advice show But this I have one piece of advice and this is critical because several people in our group of friends did not take this advice And as a result had a lot of trouble.

494
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:29,406
Rym: if you want to play burning wheel and you own the burning wheel book This goes for any tabletop RPG.

495
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:36,247
Rym: I highly recommend that you read the book Read it Carefully.

496
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:36,369
Scott: when

497
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:49,696
Rym: I say read it I mean read it as in if you read it and it says the Exponent is the number of dice you roll when making a test and then two minutes later You don't know what it means when I ask you what the exponent is for your perception skill.

498
00:29:50,118 --> 00:29:56,900
Scott: Well stat Yeah, I guess what I say is don't just read it like don't just you know process the words.

499
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,148
Rym: Don't read it like you're actually in college.

500
00:29:59,388 --> 00:30:02,640
Scott: actually read it and study it and understand what you read.

501
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:04,239
Rym: You must grok it.

502
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:07,391
Scott: You must think of it like a reading comprehension test.

503
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:13,775
Scott: if you can't pass a quiz about what you just read And you only really have to read the first 75 pages of the main book.

504
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:15,000
Scott: That's all you have to read.

505
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:17,480
Rym: That's a good idea for my burning wheel game.

506
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:21,195
Rym: I'm just gonna make a quiz and if you pass the quiz you're in the game.

507
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:22,400
Scott: I could pass the quiz.

508
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,914
Rym: I know you can pass the quiz maybe unless you ask hard questions.

509
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:27,139
Rym: I'm not gonna out fight.

510
00:30:28,101 --> 00:30:31,074
Scott: Actually, I follow the questions are from the first 75 pages.

511
00:30:31,094 --> 00:30:32,099
Scott: then I can answer them.

512
00:30:33,021 --> 00:30:37,875
Rym: Anyway, so we jumped in and we learned right away that burning wheel is not the.

513
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:42,095
Rym: I mean it can be high fantasy but it's not the high fantasy like D&D.

514
00:30:42,155 --> 00:30:48,852
Rym: and that Presented a problem for some people who didn't quite get like.

515
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,275
Rym: what makes burning wheel great?

516
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:55,740
Rym: because their characters and D&D wise We're super badass at everything and they could kill.

517
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,677
Scott: They're there.

518
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:08,615
Scott: you know the character was like I have Superpowers and I can shoot lightning and chop things in half with one swoosh of an axe and I have badass Super armor and I can't be hard.

519
00:31:08,756 --> 00:31:14,136
Rym: like my character I was a bard right and because you know a lot of stuff is not enumerated in D&D.

520
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,220
Rym: It's just character history.

521
00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:21,260
Rym: So my character was super badass at fighting and he was also super badass at diplomacy.

522
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:24,371
Rym: And he was basically super badass at everything but magic.

523
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:29,259
Rym: and that really goes against the spirit of burning wheel Which is you know, if your character is bad at some things.

524
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:42,986
Scott: Well, what it is is in D&D when you make a character, it's mostly about What your character the power of your character the power level, you know, like it's over 9,000 Exactly.

525
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:48,760
Scott: Whereas in burning wheel Character creation is not about your power level as much.

526
00:31:48,801 --> 00:32:00,856
Scott: It's about you know the the kind of person they are and and what they think about things and and what they're like to talk to and What how they would react in different situations.

527
00:32:00,937 --> 00:32:01,420
Scott: not about?

528
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,100
Scott: Can they chop down a tree in two swings or three swings and how hard are they to kill?

529
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,139
Scott: I mean, it's about that too, but much less.

530
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:14,920
Rym: I think that the real issue is that in D&D almost all of the character creation you do is two parts.

531
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:22,420
Rym: One part is making the D&D numbers character for fighting and the other part is writing a couple of pages of backstory.

532
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:24,369
Scott: It isn't even required for D&D.

533
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,560
Scott: It doesn't say any barely says anything about that in the book at all.

534
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,080
Rym: I mean granted as always people will say yeah, but you could just do that.

535
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,900
Rym: Anyway, I mean a good role player can deal with any system and that's true.

536
00:32:33,382 --> 00:32:40,326
Rym: I guess that the real point we want to make is that after having played burning wheel some more and really just jumped into it Head first and drowned in the deep end.

537
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:58,099
Rym: It's not so much that burning wheel is a superior system while I will make the argument separately in another show that burning wheel is A superior system to Dungeons & Dragons in terms of conflict resolution and in terms of combat because I hate D&D combat I think it's crap, but that's totally beside the point.

538
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:03,059
Rym: What makes burning wheel great is something that a lot of role-playing systems could do very well.

539
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:09,200
Rym: The way burning wheel is structured is such that it encourages a certain style of role-playing.

540
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:15,820
Rym: It kind of pushes you in a direction that you can go in that direction in D&D or GURPS or White Wolf or any game.

541
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:21,720
Rym: But burning wheel is set up to make it so easy to go in that direction that you'll go that way without even trying.

542
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:23,488
Scott: Yeah, it's like in D&D.

543
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:32,240
Scott: if you want to have like this intense role-playing experience D&D gives you a blank slate as far as role-playing is concerned, you know, there's no rules about role-playing.

544
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:40,980
Scott: Rope is you know, you can say whatever you want and do whatever you want As long as you don't try to do something that you you know that involves using your powers or your physicalness.

545
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,180
Scott: So it's totally a blank slate.

546
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:52,339
Scott: So if you're like a master, you know fiction writer and you're everyone else is a master fiction writer actor Lara, you know improv person.

547
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:55,230
Scott: It's gonna go great no matter what the hell system you use.

548
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,960
Scott: cuz everyone will know really cool things to do and say Yeah, the story be off.

549
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,350
Rym: I mean, I played some great D&D in high school and it was just.

550
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,066
Rym: we were all in first person as our characters Role-playing with each other.

551
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,520
Scott: it worked out great, but but it's a blank slate.

552
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:17,500
Scott: So if someone isn't an amazing actor like me, you know It's hard to think of something interesting or awesome given infinite possibility.

553
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,926
Scott: we always talk about games and how You know it.

554
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:29,456
Scott: if a game where you can just do whatever you want is not interesting You need to have constraints and then the creativity flows in figuring out how to do the most.

555
00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:34,630
Scott: considering the constraints It's like hacking, you know How to get the most out of something.

556
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,937
Scott: that only does a little.

557
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:36,679
Rym: look at this game.

558
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:39,172
Rym: We have a. there's a game called nanofictionary, which we had reviewed.

559
00:34:39,193 --> 00:34:40,540
Rym: we have to because that game is amazing.

560
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:41,362
Scott: Oh, we gotta talk.

561
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:42,447
Scott: We should have talked about that today.

562
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:43,431
Scott: nanofictionary.

563
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,600
Rym: Yeah, we'll talk about it sometime is a week.

564
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,620
Rym: There's a collaborative storytelling game and you could just get a bunch of friends sit around in a circle and take turns telling stories.

565
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,407
Rym: That's what D&D is like when it comes to role-playing.

566
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:58,340
Rym: but by playing nanofictionary now, you're putting all these rules.

567
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,490
Rym: You're forcing yourself to go in directions.

568
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,434
Rym: You might not have expected.

569
00:35:01,454 --> 00:35:08,736
Rym: you're forcing yourself to think about things You might not have thought about and those limitations often make it more interesting make the stories beyond.

570
00:35:09,197 --> 00:35:16,680
Rym: it's like you sort of Out-creative yourself because you're limited and as a result, you can't do exactly what you want and you're forced to think in a different way.

571
00:35:17,084 --> 00:35:18,360
Scott: Yeah, give it a blank slate.

572
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:20,739
Scott: The only thing you're gonna write down is what comes to mind.

573
00:35:21,124 --> 00:35:37,058
Scott: but if you put some like Mile markers if someone else or if you put mile markers down on the ground or get some mile markers from a book and lay Them out and then you start thinking Guided by these markers you're gonna go in a direction that you would never have thought of given a blank slate.

574
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:45,293
Scott: and that direction because burning wheel is designed so well is Towards interestingness and entertainment for the people sitting around the table.

575
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:47,080
Rym: and the style of play.

576
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:55,989
Rym: I mean, I think because we have we know we've always talked up to this point about burning wheel and very vague and Style of play roleplay this and this the important thing.

577
00:35:56,029 --> 00:36:18,892
Rym: We haven't talked a lot about the nitty-gritty or exactly what or why and After playing a little bit of burning wheel and mostly after talking about what little burning wheel we played incessantly for several days very specifically the style of play the burning wheel kind of encourages is this idea that Your character believes something and your character wants to fight for that belief.

578
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:20,577
Rym: and that's what all good role-playing is.

579
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:23,069
Rym: if your character doesn't want Anything why are they even in this game?

580
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:30,513
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm a cleric I worship this God and I can cast flame strike and heal people but it's all.

581
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:35,870
Scott: I'm with this party and there's a bad guy But it's like do I want the bad guy dead?

582
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,336
Scott: Do I even care?

583
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:38,280
Scott: Why do I care?

584
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:46,339
Scott: These are questions that D&D does not force you to answer and sometimes you just accept You know, yes as the default answer and go along with it.

585
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:48,992
Scott: But if any cat, let's see playing D&D right.

586
00:36:49,394 --> 00:36:50,760
Scott: and what if the cleric decides?

587
00:36:51,734 --> 00:37:03,277
Rym: You know I don't really care about this bad guy that everything or this dungeon that we're all crawling in or that happen when we were playing The the sigil game where we were single where we were all, you know, the society esoteric or whatever.

588
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:03,960
Rym: That was really cool.

589
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:14,420
Rym: Yeah But my character wasn't stupid and the thing every all the rest of the people in the game were doing their characters Was something that was stupid as far as my character was concerned.

590
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:21,160
Rym: so he didn't want anything to do with it and Effectively that forced that character out of the game because there was no point for that character to be there.

591
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:28,353
Scott: Imagine if there's a fighter a black mage a white mage and a thief All right, and they all.

592
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:29,300
Scott: they're all together.

593
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:33,332
Scott: They're all friends from some previous experience and the black and then the.

594
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:39,095
Scott: you know, the fighter gets pissed off at this Guy across town and he's like, let's go kick this guy's ass.

595
00:37:39,135 --> 00:37:40,080
Scott: He stole all my money.

596
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:41,753
Scott: What if the other people are just like?

597
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:42,660
Scott: I don't care about your money?

598
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,010
Scott: Well now it's what kind of game do you have?

599
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,560
Scott: you have a game that's uninteresting the fighters pissed.

600
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,228
Scott: He goes across town to fight a guy.

601
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:51,620
Scott: the other three people are sitting around going whatever.

602
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,664
Scott: now this can be.

603
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:53,567
Scott: how is that interesting?

604
00:37:53,647 --> 00:38:01,380
Rym: this can be avoided in D&D by either railroading or Forcing it or you have to do it actively as a player you have to suspend.

605
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,268
Scott: It's a blank slate.

606
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,600
Scott: players do whatever they want.

607
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:11,166
Rym: So you basically if you're if you have an interesting character that you sometimes have to make your character do something That your character wouldn't like.

608
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:18,132
Rym: it goes against what you wrote your character as just because otherwise the game breaks and There's no real game mechanic to avoid that.

609
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:19,740
Rym: Yeah, I mean you can't avoid it.

610
00:38:19,901 --> 00:38:22,966
Rym: I'm not gonna say it's impossible But the game doesn't really encourage it.

611
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:32,440
Rym: and this the number one insight we had when in burning wheel Was why the duel of wits is important and I'm gonna take credit for this because I take credit for this.

612
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:33,368
Rym: Well Scott and I were.

613
00:38:33,408 --> 00:38:34,660
Rym: we kind of came to it together.

614
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:45,522
Rym: Scott and I were sitting we were talking about burning wheel and what we liked about it what was going on and Eventually, we kind of hit on this idea that the duel of wits which we already think is like one of the core things of Burning wheel.

615
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:46,809
Scott: it's pretty fun to do a duel of wits.

616
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,800
Scott: first of all, it's social conflict.

617
00:38:48,961 --> 00:39:01,040
Rym: It is a way to roleplay and constrain social conflict in such a way that The better role player will not automatically win an argument and if I can't it's more about the character than the player.

618
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,570
Rym: But yet the player still enjoys it and it's

619
00:39:04,032 --> 00:39:06,321
Scott: it's really being a better role player does help Yes,

620
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:15,356
Rym: but it's really fun and it it's great and it kind of takes away the D&D problem of Combat is the only thing that matters on your character sheet because else is just roleplay.

621
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:17,024
Scott: Well because think about it What is the point?

622
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:20,200
Scott: we could just sit around and tell a story together?

623
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:28,986
Scott: the point of having a tabletop role-playing system with dice and such is to put constraints on the story and To resolve conflicts.

624
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:32,560
Scott: as in if I think the story should go left and Rym thinks the story should go, right?

625
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:36,920
Scott: You know, I think the monster should die and the DM thinks the monster should eat us all.

626
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:54,218
Scott: We need to resolve that conflict in deciding where the story should go and we use dice and numbers on paper in order to decide Which direction the story will go and we collectively agree that whatever the dice and the numbers on the paper Say is where the story will take us and then we will continue telling the story from there.

627
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:55,388
Rym: now And now.

628
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:58,710
Rym: you could say oh well You could just do that collaboratively and you could but you could.

629
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:17,620
Rym: luke rain actually says in the book that you should never let that happen because by forcing yourselves to always use concrete arbitrary sometimes just Resolution mechanics for conflict it forces the story to go in directions that you might not anticipate And as a result, it almost always makes the game more interesting.

630
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:24,707
Scott: So what the duel of wits does right is in D&D one character want things they should go left the other things They should go right.

631
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:26,079
Scott: What do you do now?

632
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:29,900
Scott: They can split up they can fight each other.

633
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,032
Scott: They how you can't change anyone's mind.

634
00:40:34,052 --> 00:40:36,340
Scott: I mean, how are you gonna change their mind?

635
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:44,740
Rym: You can only change their mind through role-playing but that That level of role-playing is beyond a lot of people and to and even if you'd like to say the best role-player in the world.

636
00:40:45,263 --> 00:40:47,880
Scott: The other guy just refuses and he says I'm going right no matter what.

637
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,592
Scott: well now the game splits up and the game is much less interesting and less fun.

638
00:40:52,074 --> 00:41:05,251
Rym: or if you like if you really can't come Up with a reason for your character to go along with it Your only option is your character just goes off to fight for what they believe in or you just railroad yourself into their plot And that it kind of betrays what your character believes.

639
00:41:05,853 --> 00:41:08,060
Rym: in burning wheel the duel of wits works.

640
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:10,080
Rym: Thus two characters want something.

641
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:17,478
Rym: Let's say we're in a boat and my character says We have to get back to the capital because the spies are gonna assassinate the king and we have to stop it.

642
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,080
Rym: But your character says screw that we've got this magic Baphomet dad that we have to get.

643
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,506
Rym: Otherwise the world's gonna end.

644
00:41:24,008 --> 00:41:25,715
Rym: and we both disagree and are.

645
00:41:25,756 --> 00:41:31,354
Rym: both of our characters believe Strongly in these things and neither one will compromise in burning wheel.

646
00:41:31,715 --> 00:41:40,780
Rym: We have a duel of wits where Metagame you step aside and say alright my character wants X your character wants Y. our beliefs won't change.

647
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:48,800
Rym: But unless we want them to yeah But whoever wins this conflict this fight this verbal fight gets what they want.

648
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:54,480
Rym: So I agree that if I lose this argument will go with you with the stupid Baphomet dad to save the world.

649
00:41:54,882 --> 00:41:58,320
Rym: But if you lose you're coming with me on the real mission to save the king.

650
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:02,100
Scott: You don't have to like it, you know, you know, you're still in character.

651
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:12,836
Scott: Your character doesn't change but you you have compromised you have agreed to go along with it And it makes the game a lot more interesting because now you have people, you know in D&D.

652
00:42:12,857 --> 00:42:16,157
Scott: It's Everyone agrees and goes along with it and is happy.

653
00:42:16,218 --> 00:42:22,720
Scott: now You've got someone who's going along with it, but they're pissed off and you start getting these sort of like.

654
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,360
Scott: You know emotions and and things going on that make the role-playing interesting.

655
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:38,020
Scott: They give you something to roleplay about and not just you know Role-playing based on the situation but in between the characters and and what's going on and it allows because this is a problem.

656
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:52,515
Rym: We had we tried to adapt some burning wheel mechanics into D&D And what we found was that whenever we did that the end the D&D game just devolved into characters fighting with each other incessantly over major things and the game went nowhere because every fight was some gigantic thing.

657
00:42:52,856 --> 00:42:58,007
Scott: and I guess you know in burning wheel and D&D you can always settle it with physical You know a battle of some sort.

658
00:42:58,067 --> 00:43:00,436
Scott: but in D&D that's sort of all you've got.

659
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:06,120
Scott: but in burning wheel You don't resort to that unless it's you know prudent because it's really dangerous.

660
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:10,359
Scott: Yeah, and if you don't if your character doesn't want to die, they're probably not gonna do that.

661
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:16,440
Scott: Or if your character's weak, which most of them are you're not gonna do that unless it you really you know means it to you.

662
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:19,760
Rym: But by adding this there's now there's a game mechanic to back it up.

663
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,986
Rym: It's you lost.

664
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:26,536
Rym: the rule of the game is your character goes along with this But he's pissed and he still believes what he believed.

665
00:43:26,758 --> 00:43:28,644
Scott: or you know It believes that ever you wanted to believe.

666
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:34,925
Scott: but the point is that what you want to believe it carries it keeps the game Interesting.

667
00:43:34,965 --> 00:43:37,600
Scott: It keeps the people the characters in the game together.

668
00:43:38,122 --> 00:43:42,080
Scott: It gives them a logical reason to be together at all times.

669
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:44,868
Scott: People are do if anyone's doing anything.

670
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:46,614
Scott: They know why they're doing it.

671
00:43:46,654 --> 00:43:48,620
Scott: There's a reason for everything that you're doing.

672
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,051
Scott: You're never saying why am I doing this?

673
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:52,940
Scott: And if you do say why are you doing this?

674
00:43:53,261 --> 00:44:01,450
Scott: we figure the answer out right away, right we back it up with rules in the game and The result may not be that you can.

675
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:08,265
Scott: you know, I mean some people might look at this and say something like oh Well that puts some sort of role-playing Restriction on what you can role play.

676
00:44:08,285 --> 00:44:09,068
Rym: That's the point.

677
00:44:09,328 --> 00:44:09,589
Scott: Yes.

678
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:13,140
Scott: The point is is that restriction makes it more interesting.

679
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,707
Scott: It allows it, you know.

680
00:44:14,747 --> 00:44:17,860
Scott: putting a restriction on the creativity makes it flow more.

681
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,885
Scott: It's like it's you know, it's.

682
00:44:18,905 --> 00:44:23,405
Scott: it's like a plugged up tube and you squeeze the tube a little so It can't flow as quickly.

683
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:25,032
Scott: but now you squeezed a bunch of goop out.

684
00:44:25,153 --> 00:44:26,760
Rym: It's the same thing with character creation.

685
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,720
Rym: I mean think of this in D&D third edition.

686
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,563
Rym: I'm making a character.

687
00:44:30,385 --> 00:44:44,720
Rym: if I put two skill points versus three or four or five into diplomacy as opposed to musical instrument or Stealth or whatever that is such a minor effect on gameplay and it just it doesn't matter.

688
00:44:45,202 --> 00:44:56,540
Rym: I don't have to give anything up to get what I want in burning wheel Choosing to put one point into like, you know, my fighting skill versus into my thinking skill is huge.

689
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:58,880
Rym: I have to give up a lot to get what I want.

690
00:44:59,482 --> 00:45:05,460
Rym: The character creation in burning wheel forces you to think about to distill your character into what is important.

691
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,268
Rym: I mean, I wrote my character.

692
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,896
Rym: I'll use the example in this game.

693
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:09,760
Rym: We're converting guys.

694
00:45:09,861 --> 00:45:24,724
Rym: He's a effectively a Roman and you know I wrote the character and he's the son the adopted son of a really important senator and his family's very wealthy and blah da da Da and he's a bard so he's good with the sword and he's a chronicler and blah blah blah And I didn't.

695
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:32,226
Rym: I could just write all this stuff and some of it was interesting and some of it wasn't and a lot of It didn't really matter in the game in Burning wheel.

696
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:36,753
Rym: when I remade the character I had to follow the life paths and the rules of making a care.

697
00:45:36,773 --> 00:45:42,240
Scott: making a character in burning wheel is Really fun because when you make the character you basically choose their life paths.

698
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:54,862
Scott: you say he started out born in the city and then he became an apprentice and then he was Outcast because he was a thief and now he's a loan shark.

699
00:45:55,183 --> 00:46:08,460
Rym: you could write a novel or make a webcomic where you didn't do anything really creative other than Burn a bunch of characters in burning wheel Roll the dice to see who wins what conflicts and then write out the exchanges that those conflicts caused.

700
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:09,966
Rym: You can do that make up.

701
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:12,799
Rym: you could make a pretty damn good novel pretty quickly like that.

702
00:46:13,402 --> 00:46:19,040
Rym: But by making Gaius this character in burning wheel I was forced to think about what is important.

703
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:23,154
Rym: Is it important that he's wealthy or it is important that he's good with the sword?

704
00:46:23,415 --> 00:46:24,840
Rym: because I can only pick one?

705
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:27,428
Rym: It is important that he knows this senator.

706
00:46:27,469 --> 00:46:28,271
Scott: It's not like D&D.

707
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,355
Scott: Everyone's level 5.

708
00:46:29,355 --> 00:46:30,679
Scott: Everyone has the same amount of money.

709
00:46:31,242 --> 00:46:34,660
Scott: Yeah, even the pauper at level 5 has this much money.

710
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,331
Scott: Like I can still have night at level 5 has the same amount of.

711
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:39,500
Rym: I can still have all those things in my character history.

712
00:46:39,681 --> 00:46:43,940
Rym: I could be the son of this important senator or not and it doesn't matter in burning wheel.

713
00:46:44,462 --> 00:46:51,549
Rym: But if I spend the points at character creation to say no, he's I'm not just his son I'm his fucking son.

714
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:54,120
Rym: What I'm saying is that is important to me.

715
00:46:54,341 --> 00:46:56,227
Rym: I chose to give up other things.

716
00:46:56,267 --> 00:47:02,312
Rym: my character could have to say to the DM and the other players and to myself that That is what is important about my character.

717
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,559
Rym: That is what my character is.

718
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:08,560
Scott: Yeah, and if you put something about your character and you don't spend any points on it, right?

719
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,156
Scott: It's just it's just something about your character in the backstory.

720
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:14,180
Scott: That's fine But it doesn't actually mean anything in the game.

721
00:47:14,221 --> 00:47:18,651
Scott: But if you spend points on it You are saying that will matter in the game.

722
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:31,104
Scott: and if it if there's ever a point in the game Where something will matter that you did spend points on like let's say I spend some points to say that my character has Is missing an eye.

723
00:47:31,385 --> 00:47:34,916
Scott: right if I just say my character has an eyepatch, that's just flavor text.

724
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,060
Scott: It doesn't do anything.

725
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:42,547
Rym: You might have a whole four-page story about how your betrayed lover stabbed you in the eye after blah blah blah But whatever.

726
00:47:42,588 --> 00:47:43,380
Rym: no one cares about that.

727
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:50,911
Scott: But if you spend a point and say I am missing an eye and I have an eyepatch and that's on your character sheet It suddenly matters.

728
00:47:51,032 --> 00:48:04,299
Scott: and if any point in the game It would ever matter you point at your character sheet and you say look everyone it says right here I spent points and it says I am missing a fucking eye and it matters and it makes a difference in the game.

729
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:09,512
Scott: your Backstory in D&D Really doesn't make a difference in the game.

730
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:11,160
Scott: You can write whatever you want your backstory.

731
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,240
Scott: I mean, let's say I make a level 5 monk.

732
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:17,166
Scott: I could write a backstory that was like I was king of the world I was a god.

733
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:22,255
Scott: then I died and I came back and I was a present and then I was this and then I was that I was isn't it?

734
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:23,964
Scott: obviously now I'm a Fifth-level monk.

735
00:48:24,124 --> 00:48:29,660
Rym: all those problems can be mitigated by like people are gonna say and argue, you know Good role-playing and forcing yourselves to stay on track.

736
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,940
Rym: And I'm not saying that you can't play D&D and make it just as dramatic and just as interesting just as awesome.

737
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:37,074
Scott: It can be done because I've done it.

738
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:37,920
Rym: I did it a lot.

739
00:48:38,101 --> 00:48:40,540
Scott: It has been done quite often throughout the history of the world.

740
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:47,318
Scott: However, it is not easy and it requires people who are really trying very hard and burning wheel makes it easy.

741
00:48:47,378 --> 00:49:00,220
Scott: the psychology of the system Moves people to do things that are more interesting and better role-playing Without having to think about it a lot without having to have a lot of acting skill without trying very hard.

742
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:07,340
Scott: It's almost as if like it psychologically makes people better role players times 10 if they just try a little bit.

743
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:08,819
Rym: Yep, it is the start.

744
00:49:09,403 --> 00:49:20,271
Rym: I think we can end this with an example because this is one Scott and I talked about An example of how a scenario is run typically in D&D Versus how the same thing would be run in burning wheel.

745
00:49:20,352 --> 00:49:24,305
Rym: and a lot of this isn't even so much game mechanics It's just in the burning wheel book.

746
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:29,399
Rym: Lou Crane says things like do it this way handle it this way that came up.

747
00:49:29,781 --> 00:49:32,557
Rym: Well, don't make it end make it complicated.

748
00:49:32,758 --> 00:49:35,908
Rym: Yep I think the scenario was our party.

749
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:46,080
Rym: a bunch of people think think like ancient Romans and a bunch of a whole bunch of people with a bunch of varied interests are trying to get back to the capital of a nation to deal with a whole bunch of bullshit.

750
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:50,480
Rym: That just happened and we're in a ship that's barely afloat and we have to stop somewhere.

751
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,454
Rym: so we stopped there and it's gonna take like four days to fix the ship.

752
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:57,784
Rym: and we're stuck here for these four days and While we're there.

753
00:49:57,804 --> 00:50:00,297
Rym: Oh, look the fort was attacked by a monster, huh?

754
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,420
Rym: Should we stay and help these people stop that monster or should we go on our way?

755
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:07,326
Rym: And that was the base conflict.

756
00:50:07,868 --> 00:50:10,356
Rym: now the D&D way this was handled was alright.

757
00:50:10,396 --> 00:50:12,896
Rym: We're here for four days There's a monster you say.

758
00:50:12,957 --> 00:50:15,151
Rym: well Obviously it being D&D.

759
00:50:15,473 --> 00:50:16,660
Rym: we'd better go deal with that.

760
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:22,619
Rym: And obviously the best way to deal with it is to roll a bunch of gather informations to find out where the monster is.

761
00:50:23,362 --> 00:50:29,919
Rym: Roll a bunch of knowledges to find out if we know how to fight it figure out where it is role play talking to the villagers and whatever.

762
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:40,039
Rym: Trek down there because obviously the monster is gonna be there fight it have a long fight on a grid win or lose But if you lose the game's over because everyone died.

763
00:50:40,482 --> 00:50:43,718
Scott: Most likely or most of the people died and it's very hard to raise dead.

764
00:50:43,758 --> 00:50:49,700
Rym: Most of them Yeah, come back and then oh look the complication because you were down there fighting the ship is gone and now you're stranded here.

765
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:51,468
Scott: Yep, now that worked.

766
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:51,970
Rym: Okay.

767
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,140
Rym: The problem was there are many problems.

768
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,240
Scott: The first problem is that what if you fail to gather information checks now, you know nothing about the monster?

769
00:50:59,862 --> 00:51:00,405
Scott: So what do you do?

770
00:51:00,586 --> 00:51:01,409
Scott: We don't know anything.

771
00:51:01,831 --> 00:51:03,498
Scott: Oh, the monster just gets what.

772
00:51:03,618 --> 00:51:03,960
Scott: what do you do?

773
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,501
Scott: It's up.

774
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:11,600
Scott: the DM pretty much just feeds you the information because it's the characters interacting with the setting and that's it.

775
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,747
Scott: That's all you have to play with.

776
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,539
Scott: and if the DM doesn't feed it to you.

777
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:15,384
Scott: You got nothing.

778
00:51:15,545 --> 00:51:18,560
Rym: the characters can interact with each other, but it doesn't matter.

779
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,020
Rym: We have nothing else to do while we're here because the ship's laid up.

780
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,559
Rym: So we're kind of railroaded onto this path, which is you know, typical D&D and it can work but it takes a lot of effort.

781
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:31,400
Rym: I say take the same scenario and apply all the I guess loot crane.

782
00:51:32,321 --> 00:51:34,347
Rym: Make it complicated make it interesting.

783
00:51:34,468 --> 00:51:35,411
Rym: Don't make it a dead end.

784
00:51:35,832 --> 00:51:39,307
Rym: All right, so we get here instead of just saying Alright, the ship's gonna be laid up.

785
00:51:39,569 --> 00:51:41,420
Rym: Here's a subplot or here's an interesting plot.

786
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,111
Rym: That's gonna be here immediately think at any juncture as the dungeon master.

787
00:51:45,834 --> 00:51:47,780
Rym: What conflict can I introduce here?

788
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,108
Rym: What can I do to make this interesting?

789
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:52,540
Rym: So don't just say oh you're stuck here for four days.

790
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:54,367
Rym: There's a thing you can investigate.

791
00:51:54,447 --> 00:51:54,909
Rym: It should be.

792
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:55,852
Scott: you're here.

793
00:51:56,414 --> 00:51:59,639
Rym: The ship's ready to go right away Like skip that skip the interesting part.

794
00:52:00,263 --> 00:52:01,169
Rym: Are you gonna stay and help?

795
00:52:01,209 --> 00:52:03,000
Rym: are you gonna get right back on your way now?

796
00:52:03,101 --> 00:52:10,927
Rym: you suddenly have a Conflict between the players because obviously some of them are gonna want to stay and help and some of them are gonna want to gonna Want to get back to the plot even better.

797
00:52:11,168 --> 00:52:14,760
Scott: Look you the characters have beliefs that are written on their character sheet, right?

798
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:24,468
Scott: so the DM looks and let's say one character has a belief that says Demons are the worst thing ever and another character We should kill them all.

799
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:31,340
Scott: and another character has a belief that says Avoid dangerous situations because you're weak, right?

800
00:52:32,101 --> 00:52:33,750
Scott: So you make a demon come now.

801
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:35,600
Scott: suddenly these two characters are at odds.

802
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:39,400
Scott: One of them says we must go kill this demon and you all have to come help me.

803
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,660
Scott: And the other one is like I ain't going anywhere near that dangerous thing.

804
00:52:43,061 --> 00:52:52,979
Scott: And now there's some interesting role-playing going on between the players not between the players in the DM But in between the players of the game and they start doing interesting things with each other.

805
00:52:53,392 --> 00:52:59,807
Rym: Yep And you know in D&D your role of knowledge check and it's usually you find out what you needed to know where you don't find It out or something like that.

806
00:52:59,827 --> 00:53:01,780
Scott: All right here here pretend here ready?

807
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,647
Scott: I'm gonna give you a thing to role-play you ready?

808
00:53:04,029 --> 00:53:04,571
Scott: Okay Rym.

809
00:53:05,032 --> 00:53:09,078
Scott: You're a kung fu master Yep, and there's a monster over there.

810
00:53:09,922 --> 00:53:10,824
Scott: Go role-play.

811
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:12,529
Rym: All right, I punch it.

812
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,595
Scott: Yeah now, how about this?

813
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:16,200
Scott: you believe?

814
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,969
Scott: that monsters are awesome and Okay one over there.

815
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:26,724
Rym: I don't go punch it I'm just.

816
00:53:26,744 --> 00:53:30,402
Scott: you know, it's like it because you have a was the best example I was.

817
00:53:30,442 --> 00:53:37,812
Scott: I couldn't think of one but when you have sort of like a belief to play on You know you it in your mind what to do it.

818
00:53:37,912 --> 00:53:39,658
Scott: It's like, you know what to do.

819
00:53:39,738 --> 00:53:40,963
Scott: It's like aha I'm gonna do this.

820
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:41,747
Rym: What do I want?

821
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:52,127
Rym: and while you'll say yeah, but your character can believe things in D&D Yeah, that's true But the constraints of burning wheel or that you have three beliefs your character might believe a lot of things and might have a lot Stuff going on.

822
00:53:52,147 --> 00:53:54,382
Scott: you have three beliefs on paper So they matter.

823
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:55,466
Rym: you crystallize it.

824
00:53:55,506 --> 00:54:00,300
Rym: you think what are the three most important things to my character in the world?

825
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,339
Rym: That is what I'm going to care about.

826
00:54:02,481 --> 00:54:04,259
Rym: That is what is going to matter in this game.

827
00:54:04,902 --> 00:54:10,160
Rym: And at the same time the dungeon master looks to everyone's beliefs and says that is what the players want to matter.

828
00:54:10,361 --> 00:54:16,751
Rym: I'm going to make those things matter at every point I can Yep, and I can be done in D&D.

829
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:19,040
Rym: I know we keep saying this but it's so much easier.

830
00:54:19,482 --> 00:54:26,184
Scott: Any role-playing system yeah, GURPS, White Wolf, LARP's 7C, L5R.

831
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,012
Rym: Oh L5R is a good setting.

832
00:54:28,353 --> 00:54:29,599
Rym: not a great game, but a good setting.

833
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:37,488
Rym: inspectors, lacuna Anything yeah But just the idea is in D&D the way it tends to go just cuz.

834
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:47,462
Rym: the way the system is and you can only get around this with good role-playing Is basically you roll the dice to succeed or fail at a task and generally a lot of times if you succeed the plot Continues.

835
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:54,885
Rym: if you fail the plot stops until you eventually succeed or you find an alternate route Or it just delays.

836
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:57,735
Scott: you like you failed you get hit by a trap.

837
00:54:58,237 --> 00:54:59,180
Scott: you lose some life.

838
00:54:59,441 --> 00:55:02,350
Rym: Continue or you failed at the gather information.

839
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:03,815
Rym: You don't find much from the villagers.

840
00:55:04,156 --> 00:55:05,440
Rym: Well shit fine.

841
00:55:05,842 --> 00:55:07,108
Rym: I search around the village.

842
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:07,892
Rym: you fail.

843
00:55:08,173 --> 00:55:09,500
Rym: well shit fine.

844
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:11,387
Rym: I send my familiar out scouting.

845
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:12,010
Rym: you fail.

846
00:55:12,251 --> 00:55:13,215
Rym: well shit fine.

847
00:55:13,235 --> 00:55:14,560
Rym: send dry on the mayor.

848
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,382
Rym: Success.

849
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:16,827
Scott: the mayor is the demon.

850
00:55:16,887 --> 00:55:17,569
Scott: go get him.

851
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:18,372
Scott: yeah.

852
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:20,859
Scott: meanwhile in burning wheel it would be roll.

853
00:55:21,683 --> 00:55:22,346
Scott: You fail.

854
00:55:22,668 --> 00:55:23,472
Scott: let it ride.

855
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,180
Scott: now that you are not getting information.

856
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:25,705
Rym: Think about that.

857
00:55:25,725 --> 00:55:26,371
Rym: that matters.

858
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:35,102
Rym: in burning wheel the way It's set up the what it encourages is if you roll the dice if you succeed you continue along the path that your character has Selected.

859
00:55:35,122 --> 00:55:36,367
Rym: you succeed at what you do.

860
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:39,680
Scott: if you roll the dice you and you get what you need succeeds.

861
00:55:40,043 --> 00:55:41,396
Scott: You say what happens.

862
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:41,780
Scott: you base.

863
00:55:41,961 --> 00:55:44,429
Scott: I say I want this and the DM.

864
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:46,977
Scott: the DM says well you have to test this.

865
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,265
Scott: make this test And I take that test.

866
00:55:49,545 --> 00:55:52,375
Scott: I test my character and my character passes the test.

867
00:55:52,977 --> 00:55:54,020
Scott: I say what happens.

868
00:55:54,161 --> 00:55:55,567
Scott: I won my dice.

869
00:55:55,607 --> 00:56:01,108
Scott: say I get to say what happens now right in In D&D.

870
00:56:01,128 --> 00:56:04,159
Rym: if they fail that right whatever you're delayed in burning wheel.

871
00:56:04,179 --> 00:56:06,988
Rym: a Failure does not mean the plot stops.

872
00:56:07,128 --> 00:56:10,498
Rym: a failure does not mean you have to find another way around this obstacle.

873
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,172
Rym: a Failure means it just got complicated or it just got interesting.

874
00:56:15,212 --> 00:56:15,593
Rym: There's alright.

875
00:56:15,814 --> 00:56:17,840
Scott: There's a good example goes in a different direction.

876
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:29,236
Rym: There's a really good example in the burning wheel book of a character who says like he's running away from some guards And he's gotten away and his intent is I want to pick this lock before the guards come to get away.

877
00:56:29,918 --> 00:56:33,148
Rym: if he succeeds What he is narrating continues to happen.

878
00:56:33,168 --> 00:56:37,823
Rym: basically every time you succeed you get to narrate a little bit of the story and no one Can say otherwise.

879
00:56:38,024 --> 00:56:38,706
Scott: you succeeded.

880
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:40,873
Scott: dice say you get dice say you win.

881
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:44,690
Rym: now if he fails you could say well You don't get the door open all right.

882
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:45,516
Rym: That's a D&D way.

883
00:56:45,576 --> 00:56:47,209
Rym: you fail now You can't get the door open.

884
00:56:47,553 --> 00:56:53,120
Rym: you could take 20 I guess but then the guards will come or you could go another way or blah blah blah blah.

885
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:56,213
Rym: The example in burning wheel in the book is all right.

886
00:56:56,695 --> 00:57:00,520
Rym: you could do yeah He doesn't open the door, but he didn't say open the door.

887
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,349
Rym: He said open the door before the guards.

888
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:03,495
Scott: that's what he wanted.

889
00:57:03,535 --> 00:57:05,884
Scott: so if he succeed He would get what he wanted.

890
00:57:06,165 --> 00:57:08,391
Scott: if he doesn't succeed by the rules.

891
00:57:08,611 --> 00:57:11,760
Scott: He doesn't get what he wants something else happens.

892
00:57:11,922 --> 00:57:17,451
Rym: So either all right He still gets the door open just as the guards arrived.

893
00:57:17,491 --> 00:57:20,580
Rym: so now you've got drama and conflict right there.

894
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:22,967
Scott: Oh, man, or he opens the door.

895
00:57:23,128 --> 00:57:24,893
Rym: this guards on the other side.

896
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:25,656
Rym: Oh, no.

897
00:57:25,877 --> 00:57:26,940
Rym: There's all sorts of directions.

898
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:40,543
Rym: You can go failing in D&D a lot of times unless you really roleplay your ass around it Or you have a really good DM Who takes care of it stops you in your tracks until you eventually succeed and continue in a burning wheel style even if you're not Playing burning wheel.

899
00:57:40,563 --> 00:57:44,480
Rym: if you just take Luke cranes advice anytime you fail it should add a complication.

900
00:57:44,581 --> 00:57:45,668
Rym: It should make it interesting.

901
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,360
Rym: I'm trying to find out.

902
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,019
Scott: I'm going around the games the story always goes forward.

903
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:55,674
Scott: it Just might not always go forward towards the positive obvious ending.

904
00:57:55,715 --> 00:58:00,918
Scott: it goes forward in Some direction might not be a direction that you were thinking of.

905
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:11,533
Scott: yeah And if the game mechanic forces you to move the stories in directions that no one thinks of I'm going around the docks Looking for some sailors to get on my ship, and I just roll.

906
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:12,296
Scott: really bad all your.

907
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:15,007
Scott: all you're thinking is I'm gonna get sailors on my ship.

908
00:58:15,027 --> 00:58:15,791
Scott: That's all you're thinking.

909
00:58:16,012 --> 00:58:16,594
Scott: I fuck up.

910
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:17,840
Rym: I don't find sailors.

911
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:21,269
Rym: I find cultists pretending to be sailors off fuck.

912
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:27,273
Scott: or even better you find sailors, but one of them is evil The fuck you.

913
00:58:27,313 --> 00:58:28,120
Rym: I don't find sailors.

914
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,599
Rym: I find out that the some old sailor that I pissed off back in the day is looking for me.

915
00:58:34,323 --> 00:58:35,933
Scott: Oh, I gotta watch out now.

916
00:58:35,954 --> 00:58:39,787
Rym: yep All right, I think we've gone long enough.

917
00:58:39,827 --> 00:58:43,400
Rym: the gist is I need to eat something by jumping into burning wheel like we did.

918
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:54,170
Scott: We've realized that the only way to play burning wheel is to just jump right the hell into it and play it Even if you mess it up a whole bunch Or you don't get everything right and you have a hard time with it.

919
00:58:54,732 --> 00:59:07,207
Rym: It doesn't matter just keep trying keep playing Even with the fact that half the people around the table didn't know how to do basic things in the game and didn't understand it Never even finish their characters or anything The gay.

920
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:19,760
Rym: as soon as a duel of wits happened You could tell the excitement was in the air because our D&D group was suddenly cheering and clapping and You'd see moments where someone says something like well blah blah blah.

921
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:27,480
Scott: Maybe we should let the people actually be gant to care about what was happening as opposed to just Going along with what they expected to happen.

922
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,571
Rym: I can't really say something that was going to and the whole D&D table would go.

923
00:59:30,591 --> 00:59:36,291
Rym: Oh you sure man Something's gonna happen now and in D&D that didn't happen.

924
00:59:36,312 --> 00:59:38,660
Scott: so on in D&D only the expected ever happened.

925
00:59:39,362 --> 00:59:42,994
Rym: Yep, and the expected was either we succeed and continue or we fail and wait because

926
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:51,102
Scott: the only things that can happen are things that You thought of whereas you're never forced to think of something that you wouldn't have thought of because and you just wouldn't thought of it Bernie

927
00:59:51,122 --> 00:59:54,323
Rym: wheel excels in that it forces you in directions You didn't expect.

928
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:57,500
Rym: I don't think we can say that more times in more ways than we've already said it.

929
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,828
Scott: I can say I'm hungry more time.

930
00:59:58,909 --> 01:00:00,680
Rym: So let's go get some Chinese soup or something.

931
01:00:07,981 --> 01:00:10,571
