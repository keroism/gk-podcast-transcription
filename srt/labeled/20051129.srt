1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,452
Rym: It's Tuesday November 29th, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:16,820
Rym: We talk about Carcassonne and Hellas.

3
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:25,810
Rym: You're gonna lay off on the legacy of Amadeus.

4
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:27,794
Scott: No, cuz it's it's.

5
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:28,937
Scott: it's our current shtick.

6
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:29,740
Rym: Yeah.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,264
Rym: Yeah for anyone who doesn't know us.

8
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:42,418
Rym: It's real easy for us to get shticks and Let's just say if you ever watch Big O The end of every episode they pick up a phone and a guy with a funny voice says some funny words and We'll leave it at that.

9
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:43,489
Rym: All right.

10
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:50,870
Rym: So, uh at work today The one guy there's one guy at work who has a kid who's kind of cool the kids into animes into gaming.

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:59,626
Rym: So I'm trying to kind of steer him toward the proper geekeries and good works and away from the bad geekeries and the MMOs and everything better than no geekeries at all.

12
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:06,030
Rym: and He doesn't want an Xbox 360 because they're a lot of money, but he wants an Xbox because he can get them cheap.

13
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:17,567
Rym: So he had a friend who got an Xbox 360 the whole deal and the kid offered to sell him his current Xbox and a Bunch of games and controllers for like 75 bucks though the normal Xbox.

14
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:19,538
Scott: Yeah, okay I was kind of cuz.

15
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:21,208
Scott: it seemed people aren't even calling cuz.

16
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:25,563
Scott: 360 is so many words that like people are just saying Xbox.

17
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:26,285
Rym: So am I?

18
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,709
Scott: yeah, so it's like.

19
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:33,658
Scott: so I don't we call the old one like Old Xbox and Xbox or just 360 without saying Xbox 360. that could do it.

20
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:43,476
Rym: Yeah, so anyway, he had a old Xbox and he was gonna sell it to this kid for 75 bucks and he did so All right, which is fantastic.

21
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,242
Rym: Not bad two hours later.

22
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:51,026
Rym: He wanted back out of the deal And he wanted his old crappy Xbox back.

23
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:51,570
Rym: really bad.

24
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:53,288
Scott: Why is that?

25
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:02,130
Rym: Apparently his new Xbox 360 Crashes if you play it for more than 20 minutes, maybe he should lift his power supply off the ground with the string.

26
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:08,490
Rym: Yeah, I gave him some advice and part of that advice was uh, make a giant heatsink and such.

27
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:12,506
Scott: Yeah, I don't know why if it's if this power strip is heating like this.

28
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:13,370
Rym: Did Microsoft not test it?

29
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:20,744
Scott: I think that some of them are bad and some of them are good But why don't they put a fan in it?

30
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:23,355
Rym: there's already fans Arts in it.

31
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,642
Rym: Remember it's a wall wart.

32
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:27,882
Scott: It just happens to be very big I know but there are fans and everything else.

33
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:31,260
Rym: put fans in that too Because it's already too loud.

34
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,890
Rym: People are already complaining about the loudness.

35
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,210
Scott: It doesn't matter if the loud if you're already loud being louder doesn't hurt you.

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,958
Rym: You're not allowed people.

37
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,740
Rym: people put it they plug it in it's loud So they put it in there like stereo cabinets.

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,785
Rym: They don't have to hear it anymore.

39
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:47,274
Scott: then it overheats Tada.

40
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:56,675
Rym: so, uh Microsoft if you're listening good game good game In Good computer news.

41
00:02:57,116 --> 00:03:01,530
Scott: Oh Firefox one and a half final came out today.

42
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:11,650
Scott: I've been using the beta for a while and Whenever they upgrade Firefox, it always amazes me what they add because I always can't imagine more.

43
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:21,699
Scott: It was a point at which when I was using Firefox point five I was like, you know, it'd really be good if they added this or this or this and They added that and that and that almost right away.

44
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,242
Scott: Uh-huh.

45
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:25,928
Scott: And by the time point nine was out I was like, what can they possibly add now?

46
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,294
Scott: this there's nothing else.

47
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:28,198
Scott: I was perfect.

48
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:37,018
Scott: and then 1.0 they added something and I was like, oh, I guess there was stuff they could add and in 1.5 I couldn't imagine what they were gonna add.

49
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:38,686
Scott: and then I got the beta.

50
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,058
Scott: and well Hey, they amazed me yet again.

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,402
Rym: So what did they add?

52
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:46,131
Rym: Cuz I'm still using a virgin prior to 1.5.

53
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:51,625
Scott: Well, first thing they did is the automatic updates and stuff of extensions and themes and Firefox itself.

54
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:53,370
Rym: it now actually works.

55
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,986
Rym: Ooh as opposed to just downloading an installer and then reinstalling.

56
00:03:57,147 --> 00:04:00,076
Rym: Yeah That's already reason enough for me.

57
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:03,470
Scott: Okay, the back and forward button performance is increased.

58
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:11,633
Scott: Basically, what they do is Firefox sort of caches buffers pre gets whatever is Whatever.

59
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:13,950
Scott: you would normally see if you clicked back or forward.

60
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,106
Scott: So that way if you click back or forward It's like instant because it already got the page when you were reading the current page.

61
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:19,970
Rym: I like that a lot.

62
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,884
Scott: All right, you can now drag the tabs to the left and to the right to reorder them.

63
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,895
Rym: Ah I'm indifferent to that.

64
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:30,910
Scott: but yeah, there was an extension to do it before but now you can just do it.

65
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:35,366
Scott: So if the tab is like to the left you want it to be to to the right.

66
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:36,309
Scott: you just pick it up move it.

67
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:43,130
Scott: The pop-up blocking is improved to beat the people who got around it just previously recently.

68
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:48,168
Rym: Haha, even though I've only seen those pop-ups once when I went to a wares site looking for wares.

69
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:56,917
Scott: Yep They have this new clear private data feature where base used to go into the options and you'd click clear history clear cache And there'd be a clear all button.

70
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:59,650
Rym: Yeah, but they also clear my cookies, which I didn't want it to clear.

71
00:04:59,693 --> 00:04:59,970
Scott: Well, yeah.

72
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:12,991
Scott: But now there's a thing you can set up where you say you basically say if I click clear private data Clear the following things location bar you choose which things you want to be cleared and then you just click that button to clear those Things.

73
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:21,890
Rym: that's real good for if you say you're in college and your mom you visit you fairly often and needs to use your Firefox Just go clear and it clears up the porn so she doesn't see the yeah porn, right?

74
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,410
Rym: God dolphins.

75
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:31,370
Scott: They added answers calm to the search engine list Which I guess you can add anything you want to that search engine list.

76
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:34,367
Scott: In fact, there's like hundreds and hundreds of things you can add.

77
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:47,170
Rym: in fact IBM did something kind of cool and they made they set up a thing Internally where you can makes it real easy for people who don't know anything about Firefox to add a internal IBM search thing.

78
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:53,620
Scott: Yeah, I all once made a search thing for that corner, but it was for OED So only people with names and passwords could use it.

79
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,590
Scott: Yeah, and it's not so useful to me anymore.

80
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:57,986
Rym: Yeah, I use dictionary calm when I need something.

81
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:04,430
Scott: Yeah All right, so you remember how it used to be in Firefox and you got an error that it would pop up a little window.

82
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:07,277
Rym: I Used to turn that off all the time.

83
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:09,970
Scott: Yeah, you would have to do some stuff to make it do in a web page.

84
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:13,490
Rym: Yeah, all you had to do was change one setting in prefs.js right?

85
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:20,482
Scott: Well now not only is that setting I guess set by default good But now the site the little error pages that you get are actually good.

86
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:21,345
Scott: They're not.

87
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:22,570
Scott: they're not that ugly poop.

88
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,199
Rym: Not bad.

89
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:29,630
Scott: All right There's a safe mode in case you screw it up with a bad extension.

90
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,980
Rym: That's good because I've been installing Firefox on a lot of servers lately.

91
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,150
Scott: The options menu is redesigned yet again slightly.

92
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:40,146
Scott: RSS discovery works a little better.

93
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:49,950
Scott: There is now better accessibility for blind people deaf people all that kind of stuff, you know Braille stuff whatnot?

94
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,390
Scott: There's a wizard for reporting a broken website.

95
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:00,110
Scott: So if you find a website that doesn't work in Firefox, you just click report and then the Firefox guys find out about it.

96
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,334
Rym: That's fantastic.

97
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:01,655
Scott: Yep.

98
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:03,722
Scott: The OS X is improved a little bit.

99
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:21,690
Scott: So you won't be screwed you know, it's so it competes with Safari better basically and It now supports SVG which you used to have to install something to support CSS to CSS 3 JavaScript 1.6 and a bunch of security fixes

100
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:22,952
Rym: Obstanding

101
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:27,807
Scott: that the CSS 3 is really important because now you can use these little canvases and things.

102
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:33,096
Scott: It's pretty cool You know fast someone already made Quake in a canvas.

103
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:35,104
Scott: So basically it's quake in JavaScript.

104
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:35,887
Rym: Oh great.

105
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:40,522
Rym: Yeah See unless you're really really like opera for some reason.

106
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:43,090
Rym: There's really no reason to not use Firefox at this point.

107
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,419
Scott: Well fire opera is free now though.

108
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,848
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't have ads anymore.

109
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:51,227
Rym: So If you like opera I gotta admit opera is a little faster than Firefox in the loading of pages.

110
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:55,499
Scott: a little faster I don't you know, but it's just crook slightly different.

111
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,024
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

112
00:07:57,284 --> 00:08:00,669
Rym: There's no excuse to use IE anymore and None at all.

113
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:04,604
Rym: I I know most of our listeners don't need to know this and they don't need to hear this.

114
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:13,163
Rym: but to those of you and I'm pointing this specifically at two people who have mentioned specifically that they still use IE Stop using it.

115
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:16,680
Rym: You Know they never patched that thing.

116
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,832
Scott: I told everyone about yeah I mean seriously if there's a guy in the corner giving out free I don't know.

117
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:30,582
Scott: Ferraris right and you have a Pinto and you know, it explodes But you're just used to driving the Pinto.

118
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,109
Scott: Why what the hell's wrong with you?

119
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,412
Rym: I mean serious.

120
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:35,477
Rym: seriously a couple lines of JavaScript.

121
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,110
Rym: I could put it on our podcast site and I'd get control over your computer.

122
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,557
Rym: Yep, I can just JavaScript.

123
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:51,050
Rym: you don't have to do anything just visit the site and then we've got you and you know What this JavaScript is all over the internet and Microsoft hasn't even really figured out how to fix it yet.

124
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,302
Scott: and basically anyone who wants to can just stick this on their website.

125
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:57,573
Scott: and if you visit using IE You're pooned.

126
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:02,350
Rym: and I know some people say oh well Firefox has exploits too and blah blah blah blah.

127
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:06,342
Rym: And as it gets more popular to have more but one not really.

128
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,051
Rym: it's had a handful and they were all patched within 24.

129
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:12,007
Rym: I think the longest time it ever took for a patch to come out was like 30 hours.

130
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,402
Scott: That was one that took a couple days, but it wasn't a serious like, you know end of the world I can take over your computer.

131
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:22,079
Scott: Yeah, the worst Can do is take over your Firefox.

132
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,290
Scott: No one can take over your computer with a Firefox hole.

133
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,903
Scott: Yeah, they can take over your computer with an IE hole.

134
00:09:28,144 --> 00:09:34,088
Rym: in fact trivially I could probably I could tell you right now exactly what JavaScript to type to do it.

135
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:36,115
Rym: Yep I'm not going to.

136
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:59,400
Scott: there was actually an interesting discussion the other day about people were talking about Firefox's market share and it's about 10% a little less maybe right in terms of number of people but what they What they were saying is that they don't think that that information that statistic even if it's accurate is really Relevant or important because the people who use IE Aren't people who visit lots and lots of websites.

137
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:12,745
Scott: so the people who maybe sign on visit website sign off Anyone who actually visits websites and goes around the web and does web things in a daily basis or a frequent basis they all most of them use Firefox at least 90% of those types of people.

138
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:28,970
Scott: because if you go to websites that are the kind of websites that only nerdy website internet savvy people use like a delicious or Blah or like nerdy blogs or super podcasts most of the visitors are Firefox by a wide margin.

139
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:36,644
Scott: Yep, so if you're not using Firefox You're really like all the smart people use it.

140
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:40,461
Scott: There's a reason all this money Seriously, they went through effort to switch to it.

141
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:48,449
Rym: I look at the statistics on our Site through the feeds and there is one person using Internet Explorer that I can see.

142
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:51,564
Rym: Awesome one, you know who you are.

143
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:52,308
Rym: Stop it.

144
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:55,640
Rym: All right, not to be mean but it's bad for you.

145
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,218
Scott: Yeah, we're not gonna tell you to do something because You know, we have some evil agenda.

146
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:02,442
Scott: I mean what the hell do we gain?

147
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,950
Scott: Yeah, it's just your loss that we're trying to prevent.

148
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:13,936
Rym: Hey, so segue Segue into thing of the day.

149
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:18,520
Scott: the thing thing thing thing and not the guy who's made of rock on the Fantastic Four.

150
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:20,624
Rym: That was really bad.

151
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:21,086
Rym: Shut up.

152
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,433
Rym: Yeah, so it's the thing of the day.

153
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:26,668
Rym: Oh, yeah is better Do more.

154
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:35,223
Rym: All right, so, uh Technology to keep kids off my damn lawn has grown a little bit Really?

155
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:40,960
Rym: There's this old codger and it's in Britain and he doesn't like the fact that punk kids hang out in front of his shop.

156
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,120
Scott: You know if I had a shop I wouldn't want punk kids loitering in front of it either.

157
00:11:45,381 --> 00:12:01,199
Rym: Yeah, and he realized and this isn't really science But it's kind of true in a general sense that generally older people There cannot hear certain frequencies that younger people can because younger people haven't been to as many concerts plain and simple.

158
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:15,091
Rym: So he made a little device that makes really annoying high-pitched noises like remember when you were in high school and Like the TV in the corner would be on and everyone in the class could hear it and they're like ah But the professor the teacher didn't hear anything.

159
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:15,895
Rym: Yep.

160
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:16,599
Rym: It's like that.

161
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:28,091
Rym: so he has this making this noise outside of the front of his store and Teenagers and punk kids hear it, but all the adult customers who come in don't The dogs be pretty pissed.

162
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:29,178
Rym: Oh, yeah dogs hate it.

163
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,939
Scott: Yeah, if you have if you run a pet shop, you don't want to use this.

164
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:37,000
Scott: No, so we should go hang out in front of the swing in his pet shop in town.

165
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:50,180
Rym: So I thought while it's kind of blah it's I got to admit for a guy who doesn't seem to know much about science It's a pretty novel solution to his problem and I applaud him for that.

166
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:51,578
Scott: I wonder if it'll work though.

167
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:58,140
Rym: Well, there were places in Britain earlier that were started playing classical music in order to keep kids from hanging out.

168
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:58,843
Scott: Did it work?

169
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,094
Rym: Not really kids like classical music.

170
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:01,858
Scott: Yeah, me too

171
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:18,399
Rym: but the only thing wrong with this is that the guy seems to think he got on this kick when he Reporters interviewed him and he was talking about how we'd like to make a stronger one that could be used against this process or this method of thievery called streaming that apparently happens in Britain.

172
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,550
Scott: Streaming streaming like streaming video.

173
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,039
Rym: Yeah only streaming shoplifting instead.

174
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:39,160
Rym: imagine you're you're in a little shop and you're standing there and Suddenly like 15 to 20 like young teenage punks run into your store Start smashing things and grabbing everything they can in a giant mess and then they all run out and scatter.

175
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:47,837
Scott: So while they ran in it first of all, so if this happened more than once I would have heard about it Unless I was the first victim in which case I'm the first victim.

176
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:48,179
Scott: Oh, well

177
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:48,763
Rym: Yeah,

178
00:13:49,125 --> 00:14:04,719
Scott: if I'd heard about it as soon as those guys came into my store It took me about the second to realize what was happening and I'd lock the door and they'd be stuck in my store and then I would have a shotgun and Then anyone who tried to walk out of the store with stuff would die.

179
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:11,166
Scott: Yeah, or I would fill them with rock salt Which would be okay probably.

180
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:14,120
Rym: now the guy seems to think that he made a stronger version.

181
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:20,998
Rym: He could stun all these kids when this happens and prevent the theft maybe with an L rad not with one of these.

182
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:22,865
Scott: no Definitely not with one.

183
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:25,236
Rym: still I thought it was cool and it was a slow news day.

184
00:14:25,256 --> 00:14:27,364
Rym: So that's all I got All right.

185
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:29,311
Scott: So do you remember back in the day?

186
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:39,538
Scott: There was this thing called master maze, which was Basically you paid 50 bucks and you got this big heavy box with this metal already painted modular dungeons.

187
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,536
Scott: Oh And you could make a dungeon for D&D by putting these pieces together and it would be nice.

188
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:46,920
Scott: and 3d it had walls.

189
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:47,745
Rym: It was awesome.

190
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:48,710
Rym: It was just really really.

191
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,420
Scott: it was awesome, but really expensive.

192
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,540
Scott: But it had nice little you know, one inch squares and everything and it was really cool.

193
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,350
Scott: You can make dungeons with opening doors and treasures and everything wicked cool.

194
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:02,360
Scott: Well some guy took it to the next level.

195
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:18,112
Scott: what he did is he made a Brand new role-playing game system and this system Depends on something quite like the master maze Only and here's where the geekiness factor doubles and triples.

196
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:22,058
Scott: It is implemented with 100% Lego.

197
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:26,170
Rym: Wow, wouldn't that almost be more expensive?

198
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:27,654
Scott: I think it would.

199
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:28,357
Scott: but he's got.

200
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,388
Scott: he's got Rules for a system.

201
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,240
Scott: He's got little guys for each class.

202
00:15:34,622 --> 00:15:40,926
Scott: He's got modular dungeons made of Lego like monsters Character sheets the whole thing.

203
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:51,340
Rym: It's it's an RPG that you play on the table with Legos to represent your guys, you know, not only is that badass, but I probably have enough Legos in my collection to do it.

204
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:53,868
Scott: I bought mostly Castle Lego in my day.

205
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:55,132
Scott: I got a lot of Castle Lego.

206
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:57,740
Rym: now see I guess I'm we're old fogies.

207
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,500
Rym: But there when we were kids you could buy buckets of generic Lego pieces for almost nothing.

208
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,016
Scott: It wasn't almost nothing.

209
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:06,320
Scott: there was.

210
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,628
Rym: We were like five Yeah, because Lego almost went out of business.

211
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,855
Rym: Well, I think they almost did.

212
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,760
Rym: they had a lot of trouble not that long ago.

213
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:23,260
Rym: The problem with Lego was that Lego bricks are incredibly durable and it's almost impossible to destroy them.

214
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:31,140
Rym: so as They sold more and more Legos the demand for Lego drops because parents people would pass them on to kids.

215
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:33,751
Rym: people would sell them on a well not on eBay.

216
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:40,819
Rym: back then if you would sell them and trade them and Once you had a certain amount of Legos, you didn't need any more Unless you're not like this guy.

217
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:41,009
Scott: Yeah.

218
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,243
Rym: so they started.

219
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:52,720
Rym: they cut back on selling generic pieces and they made their sets more expensive and they added a lot of Special parts that can't really be used in anything else to try to get people to buy more Legos.

220
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:54,765
Scott: Legos are still cool.

221
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,830
Scott: They didn't go too far.

222
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,940
Scott: Oh, I'm not claiming they're not even went a little farther.

223
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,984
Scott: They would be over the edge.

224
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:03,080
Rym: But yeah, they're a little too pricey now, but I have enough Legos to make a small house.

225
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,118
Scott: So I got plenty of Lego.

226
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:07,644
Scott: You're not supposed to call Legos.

227
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:10,472
Rym: Oh, yeah, it's Lego Lego Lego.

228
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:13,160
Scott: Lego is the pearl of Lego Lego my ego.

229
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:14,958
Rym: No, yeah.

230
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:23,031
Scott: So yeah, if you if you like D&D or role-playing games you just get in or Legos Totally got to check this out.

231
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,118
Scott: It's freaking awesome.

232
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:30,025
Rym: It's the main bit the main bit Main the main bit.

233
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:32,231
Rym: that doesn't have music for the main bit.

234
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,236
Scott: Yeah music real soon.

235
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:35,500
Rym: Yeah, we're working on it.

236
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:42,496
Rym: so it's a Gaming day and we've got two new games and they're not video games.

237
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:48,500
Rym: Yeah for once So Carcassonne is a really fun game and we've played it a lot.

238
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:49,646
Scott: Yeah, it's.

239
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,240
Scott: if you haven't played Carcassonne it's a tile laying game.

240
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,000
Scott: You basically take turns laying tiles and you put guys on the tiles.

241
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:11,440
Scott: You could put them on the grass on the road or in a castle and then you finish the roads with other tiles and you finish the castles with other tiles or You build enough castles in the grassy area and that you have score depending on how well you placed your guys.

242
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:15,100
Rym: It's really quick really fun really simple and it was a good game.

243
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:17,949
Scott: It's actually so good that it's a German board game.

244
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:19,073
Scott: they got sold at Toys R Us.

245
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:20,740
Rym: so yeah, that's saying a lot.

246
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:26,580
Rym: Yeah, now it's a great game, but there are a million expansions for it and we figured out why.

247
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:29,999
Rym: Well many reasons why but the base set.

248
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:32,627
Rym: After you play it a lot and get good at it.

249
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:42,140
Rym: You discover that due to the way the tiles are set up It is very basically it's easier to screw other people than it is to get points for yourself.

250
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:49,539
Scott: Yeah, for example, if someone else is gonna finish a castle for a bunch of points You know that such and such a tile does not exist.

251
00:18:50,123 --> 00:19:00,746
Scott: So you arrange other tiles in such a way So that they need a tile that does not exist in order to complete their castle and thus their castle does not complete and they Don't score points.

252
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:06,656
Rym: and if you're playing this game with you know, five people No one ever finishes anything and it's just a game of who screwed who the most.

253
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:08,343
Scott: Yep It's that's.

254
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:10,431
Scott: if the people know what's got who know how to play.

255
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:13,907
Scott: if you play with noobs or if you've never played before This won't happen.

256
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,799
Scott: You'll pretty much play a nice easy game.

257
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:25,052
Rym: So we picked up the hotels and citadels or cathedrals Expansions and it only adds 18 tiles to the game.

258
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:28,507
Rym: it adds two new kinds of tiles But and they actually add a lot to the game.

259
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,860
Rym: I found I was skeptical at first but they actually make it really interesting.

260
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:37,700
Rym: Yep, but these 18 tiles are all the weird tiles that didn't exist in the other game.

261
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:47,013
Rym: they're all like a city in a city and then like a road coming in in a weird direction or like a City or like four city end caps all around a piece of grass.

262
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:52,575
Rym: now you play this game with like 40 tiles So you wouldn't think adding 18 tiles makes a difference makes a huge difference.

263
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:53,700
Rym: It's a completely different game.

264
00:19:53,862 --> 00:20:01,819
Rym: It's now actually a game of Completing things because every time you think you screwed someone and you walled off their city and they can't find a piece They draw the piece they need like three times.

265
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:21,620
Scott: See the problem was though is without the expansion you end up always needing a tile and then not getting it now with the expansion Not only do you get the tiles you need you get a bunch of really wicked Tiles that you don't need and you have to end up sticking them way off at the edge of the map because you don't have A weird situation to use them in because you filled it up already.

266
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,600
Rym: And I gotta say it's fantastic since there's only two of us.

267
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,759
Rym: We like playing two-player games and there aren't that many good two-player games.

268
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,416
Rym: Carcassonne has been renewed to the point that I think we're gonna play it after we finish the show tonight.

269
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:38,656
Scott: Yeah, it definitely The expansion revived the game, you know, it was it was big.

270
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,540
Scott: then it kind of faded.

271
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,830
Scott: Then we played a little bit then it faded.

272
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:43,820
Scott: then the expansion has revived it to full.

273
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,169
Rym: I can't wait to play the expansion with more people.

274
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:52,360
Scott: Yeah, the the thing I think with with more people I think actually all the tiles will get used awesomely.

275
00:20:52,601 --> 00:21:01,700
Rym: yeah, but anyone who tries to go for the size castles we're going for will be unhappy or Multiple people will try to finish castles and then try to edge each other out with a big, dude.

276
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:05,774
Scott: Oh as opposed to where now we try to edge each other out in the farms.

277
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:07,100
Scott: The farms won't matter so much.

278
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,431
Scott: Yeah going for the big 70-point castle Cathedral whatever is in them.

279
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:20,600
Scott: Also, I used to not pay attention to road so much but now with the inns I keep getting lots of road points.

280
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:26,220
Rym: Yep, but so often you think if you ever play this game, you'll think how could anyone ever screw me on a road?

281
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:29,219
Rym: How could I ever get to the point where I couldn't cap off a road?

282
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,429
Rym: You freaking can't cap off roads because people screw you.

283
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:35,619
Rym: Oh, yeah, I won because of it and you won because of it.

284
00:21:36,284 --> 00:21:36,989
Scott: It's a good plan.

285
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:41,367
Scott: Yeah The other thing is a lot of the.

286
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:43,295
Scott: there are other Carcassonne expansions like.

287
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,320
Rym: there's billions of them.

288
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,272
Scott: Well, some of them aren't expansions.

289
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,359
Scott: I actually looked into it.

290
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:56,359
Scott: Yeah Some of them are actually other games and what they did is they rebranded the games as Carcassonne The castle or Carcassonne the something else

291
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:58,306
Rym: Yep, like no dragon and the princess

292
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,060
Scott: so that people who liked Carcassonne would be more likely to buy this other game.

293
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:07,726
Scott: But some of them are expansions like the dragon and the princess or whatever It's called.

294
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,520
Scott: and there's another one with a little count.

295
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:20,940
Scott: Yeah count Dracula, but not a vampire that goes around the map You know and like the dragon eats your farmer guys and the princess saves them and little witches and fairies and things.

296
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:30,317
Scott: And I don't know if I like those expansions so much but I haven't tried them so I can't say But if this expansion runs dry, I'll definitely be willing to try some more.

297
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:35,700
Rym: Yep So if you ever buy a Carcassonne just pick up ins and cathedrals, it's definitely worth it.

298
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:41,395
Scott: Yeah, but as for the other games that are labeled Carcassonne that are actually completely different games.

299
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,160
Scott: Well, they're not completely different.

300
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,060
Scott: They're similar in that they are tile laying games that you place guys on the tiles, you know.

301
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,249
Scott: Which is why they're able to label them Carcassonne.

302
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:54,107
Scott: but the ones that aren't actually Carcassonne I don't know.

303
00:22:54,128 --> 00:22:59,680
Scott: I guess you have to look at them individually Maybe what the original games were to figure out if they're good or not.

304
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:06,464
Rym: We also picked up a bunch of other games, but we only played one of them because the rest require More than two people.

305
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,471
Scott: we'll play those by next week.

306
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:08,912
Scott: Hopefully.

307
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,160
Scott: Yeah, because they look super awesome.

308
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,691
Rym: Yeah, I have to head up to Albany grab some Pete and play some board game.

309
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:15,915
Scott: Well card games.

310
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:20,329
Scott: They're card games other games Games games.

311
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:32,754
Scott: Anyway, the game that we were able to play which is two-player Which I bought because it was two-player and was recommended as a good two-player game is helles H-e-l-l-a-s as in Hellenic culture Greeks.

312
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:34,260
Scott: It's a big Greek game.

313
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,022
Scott: In fact.

314
00:23:35,344 --> 00:23:36,909
Scott: the names of little guys in the game.

315
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:39,800
Scott: It just says Greeks put your Greek on the island.

316
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:46,257
Scott: It's um, we played it once I won handily.

317
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:55,047
Scott: yeah the game isn't perfect, but it's better than the impression before playing it would.

318
00:23:55,108 --> 00:24:06,829
Rym: yes let you feel because once we played it, it's fun and It looks like once we both get good at it and kind of figure out the strategies and the counters to the strategies It looks like a decent kill some time two-player game.

319
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:07,190
Rym: Yep.

320
00:24:07,672 --> 00:24:09,680
Rym: The problem was when we were first reading through the rules.

321
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:12,020
Rym: It sounds real arbitrary.

322
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:21,140
Scott: It's like you could only have three guys here and you can only have this many this and you can only do This when the moon is in the south.

323
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:27,376
Rym: If there's a squiggly line on the card you can use it sometimes but other times you can't.

324
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:30,605
Scott: and yeah and The rules are in.

325
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:40,800
Rym: they don't have the super preciseness of wording that you know A hundred percent what things do and we actually had to look up errata on one rule because there was no way to know.

326
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,270
Scott: Yep, and you know, sometimes it's a little vague.

327
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,156
Scott: Like can you play god cards now?

328
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,240
Scott: Can you play them now?

329
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:48,565
Scott: Did this one matter?

330
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:49,469
Scott: Does that one matter?

331
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,855
Scott: Can I go back on that?

332
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:51,658
Scott: What are you know?

333
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:57,508
Scott: And sometimes it feels a little loose like, you know I'm used to having games where the rules are.

334
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:01,483
Scott: you do this then you do this then you do this and that is the end And you skip this.

335
00:25:01,523 --> 00:25:03,412
Rym: Yeah, like you can just play cards whenever.

336
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:06,789
Rym: yes, like I play a card Yeah, I play a counter spell to that.

337
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,760
Rym: Well, I play a counter spell to your counter spell.

338
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:09,828
Rym: Well, I play a card.

339
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:11,439
Rym: Let me take my counter spell back and play it again.

340
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:14,751
Rym: Yeah, I do the same and then I play my original card.

341
00:25:15,052 --> 00:25:24,244
Scott: Yeah, there are cards just flying around Everywhere and it feels kind of willy-nilly which isn't such a good feeling except it isn't actually willy-nilly It's actually precise.

342
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:26,071
Rym: You just have to get over that feeling.

343
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,625
Rym: Yeah, also if you play the game Scott this is why Scott lost.

344
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:34,477
Rym: he made the mistake of thinking that it was a game of conquer territory.

345
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:35,943
Rym: move your guys around have Strong armies.

346
00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:39,560
Rym: It's really a card game and maneuvering game.

347
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,600
Scott: Mmm, the cards pretty much make the whole game because you're only allowed to have three Greeks in a city.

348
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:52,549
Scott: So and you have a limited supply of Greek a very limited supply of Greeks So you basically you must spread the Greeks thin.

349
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:55,540
Scott: so getting new territory is all about cards.

350
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:56,543
Scott: You can't do.

351
00:25:56,563 --> 00:26:03,989
Scott: basically if you try to do something without cards your chances of succeeding are pretty much nil or a voyaging Which you just never did.

352
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:10,480
Scott: I tried to do voyaging But I always felt so weak that I didn't want to voyage because then I wouldn't reinforce my position.

353
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,869
Rym: The thing is I was equally weak.

354
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,677
Scott: So I realized that You were a little stronger than me though in a lot of places that's cuz.

355
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:21,015
Rym: I'm better stronger braver faster handsomer.

356
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:26,508
Scott: You want to play it like risk, but you can't.

357
00:26:26,528 --> 00:26:29,800
Scott: you just have to try to get more islands and then it's not risk.

358
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:30,763
Rym: Don't think it is.

359
00:26:30,783 --> 00:26:31,245
Rym: you lose.

360
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:32,450
Scott: You'll totally lose.

361
00:26:33,422 --> 00:26:36,741
Rym: Or unless the other guy also thinks is risk and then no one will ever win There is.

362
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:37,082
Scott: the only.

363
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:51,834
Scott: the one thing though is that because the cards basically make the game is That if you don't get the cards It's like you'll get every card because there's so few but if you don't have the cards you want when you got them when you Want them.

364
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:57,570
Rym: see I think that's yes Cuz I. basically what I did is I drew cards that I didn't want and I didn't get the cards I wanted.

365
00:26:58,112 --> 00:27:04,038
Rym: So what I did is I looked at the cards I had and thought well then I can use these cards to do this and I had to change my strategy constantly.

366
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,170
Scott: Yeah, I tried to use whatever cards I had.

367
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:12,320
Rym: I tried to do something with but a lot of times You gotta save cards don't use a card unless you have to.

368
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:14,666
Rym: that way when you need a card you got a card.

369
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:20,970
Rym: Yeah The one thing about the game that bugs me is it feels because we said earlier the rules are kind of arbitrary.

370
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:25,730
Rym: It feels like they made this game and they played it and then they realized oh, it's broken.

371
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:26,969
Rym: If you do this you win automatically.

372
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:32,507
Rym: So they made a rule against that and then oh now it's broken this way and they just tacked on rules until the game was balanced.

373
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:34,979
Scott: Yeah, it does kind of feel like that.

374
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:35,824
Rym: Of course.

375
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:36,488
Rym: It's balanced.

376
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:43,424
Rym: So Yeah, it's balanced definitely not an A game not an A game but not a C game.

377
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:50,309
Scott: no, oh if you know If I had to take one two-player game with me to the end of the world, this would not be it.

378
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:51,435
Rym: I'd take San Juan.

379
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:57,689
Scott: maybe San Juan, but you know if We're sitting around we want to play a two-player game.

380
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,929
Scott: You got you know, the other games are a little played out.

381
00:28:01,991 --> 00:28:02,653
Scott: It's not bad.

382
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:07,830
Scott: if I you know, it would definitely be in I guess some top ten two-player games so far.

383
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:09,590
Rym: Yeah, we don't know so many two-player games.

384
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,990
Rym: I mean technically Tigris and Euphrates is two-player, but it only lasts about three.

385
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,339
Scott: It's not a very good of being a two-player game.

386
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,483
Rym: Shogun is two-player.

387
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:18,226
Rym: So is risk.

388
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,250
Scott: Yeah, those aren't very good.

389
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:21,315
Scott: That's like a Lombre.

390
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:23,083
Scott: Yeah, you play with Matt Matt.

391
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:28,990
Scott: Yeah, but There are a whole bunch of other two-player games in this series.

392
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:36,376
Scott: they all come in the same little square boxes and they say cosmos on them with a K and One of the other ones is lost cities.

393
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,581
Scott: I'm thinking about gonna try that.

394
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:39,910
Scott: it's pretty popular and there's some other ones.

395
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:43,578
Scott: So this is just one of the more popular ones in the series.

396
00:28:43,618 --> 00:28:46,747
Scott: So I got it tried it not really regretting buying it.

397
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:59,149
Scott: Yeah, so so we like the German board games and So since the college ended there hasn't been too much Opportunity to play them because a lot of them need more than two people.

398
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:02,870
Rym: Granted we've had some crazy weekends of gaming where we played every game.

399
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:17,561
Scott: Yeah, of course, but you know, I've since I left college and got here with the job and everything I've been looking for some people to play with and You know board game geek was the place and I did kind of find some people but you know It never really came together a hundred percent.

400
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:18,807
Rym: Yeah, I missed all this.

401
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:31,920
Scott: I was out of town Yeah, and I heard about a group called maws like month weeks and months ago Maybe even but I could never actually find them because the only way to contact them was old email addresses that weren't used and all Kinds of stuff like that.

402
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:32,950
Rym: Why don't they have a website?

403
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,695
Scott: They're gonna have one soon.

404
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:36,485
Scott: I guess that's least what that was.

405
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:37,450
Rym: Should we make it for him?

406
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,006
Scott: I mean someone else I think already made it but some people have to look it over.

407
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:41,448
Scott: I don't know.

408
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:41,829
Scott: I don't care.

409
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:46,818
Scott: stand for Mid Hudson area war gamers society.

410
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:56,830
Rym: every game every gamer club like that has a weird name like that because they think this Arweg the Rochester area wargaming guild Rochester war game.

411
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:03,708
Scott: Anyway, that's because all of these things all the clubs that are still around are the ancient.

412
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:15,770
Scott: They're the really old clubs from like the 70s from when it was war gaming and now that wargaming is left popular They've moved over to the German games and RPGs and CCGs and things.

413
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,764
Rym: Why don't we start our own club with a non stupid name right here in Beacon?

414
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,779
Scott: I Guess the guy who does the board game podcast.

415
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,850
Scott: his his group is the Santa Clarita board gamers.

416
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:28,359
Rym: We've officially formed a group in Beacon.

417
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:29,002
Rym: There's two of us.

418
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:29,845
Rym: We'll name it later.

419
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:38,555
Scott: I had the beacon board gamers Anyway, so I finally found these guys, you know via someone else posting on board game geek And I was just lucky.

420
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:41,830
Scott: I visited that day because I don't go there that often and I saw the word Poughkeepsie.

421
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:45,224
Scott: So I went down to the Dragon's Den, which is local game store.

422
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:46,530
Scott: It's not the greatest game store.

423
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:47,476
Scott: It actually moved.

424
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:49,750
Scott: It's a little better now, but you know, it's alright.

425
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,496
Scott: Went down there played some games.

426
00:30:53,078 --> 00:31:01,649
Scott: The guys are pretty much typical middle-aged gamer guys, you know, they're not very Attractive but you know, they're funny, you know, they don't know how to play games.

427
00:31:02,557 --> 00:31:12,896
Scott: it was a good time and If I didn't have anything better to do I wouldn't mind going back playing some more games, you know There was when I first got there.

428
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:17,630
Scott: There was some guys were actually playing a super real war game and I was like, whoa

429
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:23,811
Rym: You mean the kind of game where two guys sit there and like a tank runs into another tank Where

430
00:31:23,832 --> 00:31:26,506
Scott: there are little tiny squares of cardboard with numbers and some they

431
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:27,109
Rym: don't roll dice.

432
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:31,992
Rym: They actually sit there with an encyclopedia and they look up the different encyclopedia.

433
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:42,686
Scott: but like they had a map a real kind of somewhat more real map than any kind of game I play and Little things they're like like Oh airplanes and tanks and the names of airplanes.

434
00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:43,750
Rym: see those games scare me.

435
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:50,050
Rym: That's the kind of game where you'd look up in a book and then you'd say yeah But this tank in the real world that two-inch armor and therefore the shells couldn't penetrate.

436
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:55,179
Scott: Yeah, I would say yeah, but a bunch of other guys I think in another table, so I sat down with them.

437
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,890
Scott: one guy was the guy that I spoke to on board game geek.

438
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:03,890
Scott: He was an okay kind of guy, you know, he was a little grumbly took the games like this tiny bit too seriously.

439
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:08,290
Rym: That's tough for us to say because we take our games pretty damn seriously.

440
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:12,868
Scott: It was like he'd be a little grumbly like if you did a move against him, you know and stuff like that.

441
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:13,330
Scott: It was cool.

442
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:18,758
Scott: There was another guy He I didn't know I don't remember anyone's name.

443
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,082
Scott: one guy was Z man.

444
00:32:20,122 --> 00:32:22,510
Scott: He actually owned a game company Z man games.

445
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:25,689
Scott: He was an okay guy, but he's a little talk too much a little bit.

446
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:29,764
Scott: You know, I met the owner of dragons den actually right before I left.

447
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:38,550
Scott: He was a cool guy, you know I mean he was trying to push his products Which I guess is understandable and you know kind of puts me off when someone is like that.

448
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:59,590
Scott: But other than that, he seemed like, you know a decent guy looks like a game store owner, you know The game store does sell a lot of paintball airsoft and that seems to be their Biggest moneymaker which is kind of sad You know, but anyway, I also I played a bunch of these simple German type card games that were pretty fun.

449
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:01,621
Scott: One of them was with these red chips.

450
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:02,667
Scott: It was like a game of chicken.

451
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:03,290
Scott: It was pretty cool.

452
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:13,329
Rym: another one I played was Shit Do I need to add a cue here?

453
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:16,236
Scott: I remember what the other one was.

454
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:18,705
Scott: just add the cue and you played some games.

455
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:26,330
Rym: Yeah So, yeah, that's probably our best chance to actually have people to play board games with nowadays.

456
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:30,404
Scott: Yeah, oh, I played one other game that was called Vegas showdown.

457
00:33:30,485 --> 00:33:41,189
Scott: It was a game from Hasbro, well, they called it Hasbro Hill, you know Avalon Hill the cut the people label that does like axis and allies and all those things.

458
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:56,605
Scott: and You know, I was kind of iffy on this game with its Vegas theme and such but actually turned out to be a really good Game, you know despite the the Vegas theme like you bid on pieces of a casino And then you build a casino out of them and use the casino chips for money.

459
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,970
Rym: Oh, I like bidding games.

460
00:33:58,713 --> 00:33:59,155
Scott: Yeah, it was.

461
00:33:59,175 --> 00:34:02,210
Scott: it was actually a much better game than I thought even though I lost horribly.

462
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,018
Scott: Yeah Overall good time.

463
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:06,783
Rym: All right.

464
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:07,790
Rym: There's some geeks out there.

465
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:12,847
Scott: Yeah, if you're uh, you know down in the mid Hudson Valley, you

466
00:34:12,888 --> 00:34:14,393
Rym: know Hudson River Yeah,

467
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:26,734
Scott: and you're looking for some German type board games or anything like that There's a mailing list and I guess you can get on it by some miracle of finding these guys because they like to hide in The hole somewhere.

468
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:29,907
Rym: Well post whatever links we can come up with whenever we come up with them.

469
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:33,516
Scott: Yeah, and Get some gaming action going on.

470
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,424
Rym: or you know email us and come to beacon.

471
00:34:35,444 --> 00:34:36,989
Rym: We got a big house and we'll play some board games.

472
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:38,717
Rym: Oh, yeah, I'll warn you though.

473
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,429
Rym: Do you play Puerto Rico or tires and Euphrates with us?

474
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:42,958
Rym: expect to cry.

475
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:49,389
Scott: I Know these guys didn't cry when I played against them, even though I did shut the guy down an external conflict with five blue tiles.

476
00:34:50,532 --> 00:34:52,905
Scott: He became after me in this blue external conflict.

477
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:56,850
Scott: He was so confident He was ahead by five and I was like five blue tiles.

478
00:34:57,231 --> 00:35:00,501
Scott: I was just five blue tiles and he was like he was like dying.

479
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:02,266
Scott: I was like, yeah.

480
00:35:02,286 --> 00:35:05,359
Rym: Yeah, see I'm not saying Oh, we're so good blah blah blah.

481
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,237
Rym: I'm saying we're bastards Like most people who seem to play board games.

482
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:11,681
Rym: don't bevagon.

483
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:12,944
Rym: They don't take their turn.

484
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:15,010
Scott: These guys definitely did not take their turn.

485
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:20,278
Scott: I think their turn faster than some people I know But they didn't they're not.

486
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,630
Scott: I took my turn instantly and they did not because board game geek.

487
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:31,109
Rym: I saw a thread where people talking about what do you do when your friends take too long and the Consensus seemed to be that you take no more than a few minutes on your turn?

488
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:42,410
Scott: We take about five seconds and get really pissed if someone takes more than about five seconds, yeah people wonder like They were amazed when I said I played Puerto Rico five times in a day.

489
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,133
Scott: It must take.

490
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:44,960
Scott: that must mean ten hours to them.

491
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:50,301
Rym: It means four hours to me Yeah, so because I mean a lot of games like.

492
00:35:50,321 --> 00:35:56,100
Rym: we have a friend Scott Johnson and he's on defucking feedable at this game called acquired

493
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,168
Scott: apparently a lot of people use that same strategy of

494
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:06,580
Rym: yeah You save a lot of games if you sit there and think long enough You'll know exactly what to do because you can calculate every option

495
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:10,008
Scott: because they're only there because there are too many options to think of them instantly.

496
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,310
Scott: But it's not like chess where you would have to think forever to figure out every possible move.

497
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:18,849
Scott: There's a limited number of moves and you can calculate the points of each one.

498
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:26,069
Rym: however to me that Reduces the skill of the game because if everyone does that the game takes forever and then everyone makes the perfect move every round.

499
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:33,349
Scott: and this I don't like a game where you can do that Even if there's a you know a whole bunch of choices because then a computer can beat the game.

500
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:35,069
Scott: Computer can do it.

501
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:41,276
Rym: Why am I doing that in Tigris and Euphrates and I've seen ways to do it where I could sit there and count and come up with statistics immediately.

502
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:43,505
Rym: Well, not immediately, but I could come over the statistics.

503
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:54,710
Rym: I don't think you could write of Fully optimized AI to play But I could come up with the percent chances I have of everything I want to do succeeding and I thought I sat there.

504
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,450
Scott: You can think of every option and you see every future of every tile in acquire.

505
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:03,930
Scott: You can see every spot that you can do something and figure out each move.

506
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:07,269
Scott: That's possible not just each move you might want to do.

507
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:14,550
Rym: But I think the point is in games like that Part of the skill is not only being able to think of what to do, but being able to think of it quickly.

508
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:16,940
Scott: Yeah, I think that they should have.

509
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,530
Scott: a lot of games should have variants with egg timers.

510
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:20,917
Scott: I might go buy an egg timer.

511
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:23,690
Rym: We should get one or actually we should buy a chess timer.

512
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:25,757
Scott: Yeah, well you get the little gaming egg timers.

513
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,142
Scott: They're like specifically for games.

514
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:27,745
Scott: They're one minute.

515
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,109
Scott: Yeah, those are good.

516
00:37:31,335 --> 00:37:34,974
Rym: So, uh, is it to Time to leave?

517
00:37:35,717 --> 00:37:51,171
Rym: it's time to leave a legacy of Amadeus and That was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
