1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,748
Rym: It's Tuesday October 9th 2018.

2
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:18,278
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight the 40 games You must play.

3
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:21,217
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:30,059
Rym: So, uh, all I want to say is that I've said this a lot lately, but 35 ain't 25 It's I think isn't 39 ain't 29.

5
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:30,442
Scott: You know what?

6
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,800
Rym: Third 30 anything ain't 20 anything.

7
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:44,140
Rym: So I got my first like legit sports injury that wasn't me hurting myself in an accident Uh-huh, and basically I have.

8
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:50,366
Rym: I probably have plantar fasciate it Basically the tendon on the bottom of my foot is angry at me.

9
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:51,350
Scott: a lot of people have that.

10
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:53,398
Rym: Yeah, and you know what causes it.

11
00:00:53,458 --> 00:01:03,274
Rym: the main things that cause it are being really obese because like the weight will just mess up your being a professional athlete, yep, or Or Over training.

12
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:07,770
Rym: and I thought to myself because I went to the doctor and they were like have you been exercising more than usual?

13
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:17,629
Rym: And I thought back and yeah, I ran a half marathon literally every weekend for over a month And the doctor was like, yeah, it'll do it.

14
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:23,473
Rym: So I can still I can continue to exercise like that But I got it.

15
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:28,084
Rym: Basically what I'm doing is when I'm doing a really long run like 10 miles 20 miles or whatever.

16
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:31,693
Rym: I And I got it.

17
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:35,285
Rym: either stop before I get sloppy or I got a run better when I'm tired.

18
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:37,010
Rym: Mm-hmm and it'll probably go away.

19
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:41,029
Scott: Yeah, you know a lot of pro athletes have had that you let Manning had it.

20
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,475
Scott: Yeah hockey players had it.

21
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:45,950
Rym: lots of people get because it's really common is caused by over training usually.

22
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:53,364
Rym: So either being really really really athletic or not at all athletic and if you're not in one of those two classes It's really hard to get it.

23
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:53,768
Rym: Mm-hmm.

24
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:55,716
Rym: So, uh, yeah, let's get right in.

25
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:58,690
Rym: you got any news and you geek bites any stuff on this Tuesday gaming.

26
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,147
Scott: Yes, there was this game called interplanetary which is a game name so generic.

27
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:09,508
Scott: You can't imagine it hadn't been used yet But it hasn't for at least not for a video game that I know of and it was on steam for $4 this weekend.

28
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,391
Scott: Sadly, it's now $15.

29
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:17,850
Scott: So what this game is is actually so shockingly simple and but I'm surprised has never been done before right?

30
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:21,331
Scott: All right, so I don't I mean, it's worth about $4.

31
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,669
Scott: I would be sad if I paid the 15, but here's how the game works.

32
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,350
Scott: ready You get a planet around a solar system.

33
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:31,733
Scott: All right enemies also have planets around the solar system are On your planet.

34
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:41,808
Scott: you build stuff and you have to build like everything has to be touching a power plant and you have these cities You try to defend Has a circular radius and you have multiple cities and you know.

35
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:42,310
Scott: and you know.

36
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:49,296
Scott: You build things like mines to get resources power plants to get energy, you know intelligence Counterintelligence buildings.

37
00:02:49,356 --> 00:03:06,330
Scott: and then you build weapons, right and then it's turn-based But everyone takes their turn simultaneously Everyone's building then everyone fires and then once everyone's ready all the guns fire and they fire like fucking scorched earth.

38
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:14,490
Scott: but is Not like scorched earth because you're on a planet that's moving and there's gravity.

39
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,073
Scott: So you

40
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,363
Rym: fire stuff off and and then it circles

41
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:31,246
Scott: and there's a there's a star And there's planets that have gravity and you adjust, you know The and the other thing is like your planet is a sphere Like what if your gun is on that your planet spins and wherever the planets stop?

42
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:32,370
Scott: That's where you're firing from.

43
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:39,390
Scott: So you might not be able to aim your gun and you might need to get guns on both sides of your planet So you can shoot in the different direction.

44
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,390
Rym: This looks pretty up my alley.

45
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:46,290
Scott: The only other thing that's in the game basically is like it's basically that plus a tech tree.

46
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,534
Scott: so it's like every turn.

47
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:55,630
Scott: you sort of have to decide like am I gonna spend my energy and my read and my Resources that I my materials that I mind up out of my planet?

48
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:59,343
Scott: Am I gonna spend them on like building a missile and firing it?

49
00:03:59,403 --> 00:04:01,450
Scott: Am I gonna spend it on building new buildings?

50
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:06,881
Scott: I'm gonna spend it on you know Right and every turn your energy you get X energy per turn.

51
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:10,032
Scott: your energy output is per turn and if you don't use it You lose it.

52
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:13,946
Scott: and your your materials is sort of you can.

53
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,038
Scott: you can stockpile them Right, but the other thing about the game.

54
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,103
Scott: there's like really the whole game.

55
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:19,870
Scott: besides this giant tech tree.

56
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,270
Scott: It's just a giant tech tree where you get better stuff like better, you know weapons.

57
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:29,050
Scott: Yeah, you know is that a is a little bit of xcom because you have you build defensive buildings.

58
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:34,658
Scott: I didn't learn this till after many turns Use all your energy firing all your weapons.

59
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,390
Scott: your defenses need use energy every time they block something.

60
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,482
Scott: So you have to just save unused energy at the end of your turn.

61
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:45,914
Scott: So your defense is actually do something Like block things that land.

62
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,479
Rym: so turn-based real-time turn-based.

63
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:48,421
Scott: It's turn-based.

64
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:51,430
Scott: you spend your turn, you know spending resources on your planet.

65
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:59,090
Scott: Then you line up all your shots and then you push n turn and then all the shots from all the planets fire at The same time and then you take another turn cuz I see it has hot seat.

66
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:02,030
Rym: This is actually that could be an okay game to play like late at night.

67
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:09,279
Scott: I think I see it would be intolerable because it would take if you're played to four players like four times as long And if everyone had a copy.

68
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:11,250
Scott: so at four dollars not bad.

69
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,638
Scott: You got to learn the tech tree.

70
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:14,530
Scott: also aiming is a huge pain in the ass.

71
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:22,310
Scott: It's like super like prediction skill-based aiming until I guess you get more advanced weapons that don't need as much skill.

72
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:29,930
Scott: But that's probably good because gate like scorch the problem Gives you this red line that shows you you like your predicted trajectory.

73
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,569
Scott: Yeah, but that's based on where the planets are now.

74
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:39,630
Scott: It doesn't give you any hints about where the planets are gonna be and you can sort of be like well This shot is gonna take this long to get there.

75
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:47,826
Scott: And so it's like if your shot is going slow and taking a long route the other planet's gonna move a lot If a guy's right next to you, right?

76
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,613
Scott: And then the turns end.

77
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:58,929
Scott: actually like once everyone fires all the planets start moving and they don't stop for the next turn Until all the shots stop moving or there's none left.

78
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:03,242
Scott: You can actually fire like one shot with a super long trajectory.

79
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,970
Scott: if you want the planets to move a lot before the next turn.

80
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:17,282
Scott: right, there's things like that going on, but If you like scorched earth, but wish it was way harder and had a tech tree And you want to spend $15 or wait for it to be $4 again?

81
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,358
Scott: Interplanetary is on Steam You know not not a total bad game.

82
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,401
Scott: You know it's a little.

83
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:30,873
Scott: it's not super polished, but it's definitely unique and Scratches.

84
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,581
Scott: itches that some other games aren't scratching.

85
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,290
Rym: You know what though it also gives me an idea.

86
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:41,574
Rym: We I feel like we should stream some versus scorched earth Funky, but I will.

87
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:44,120
Scott: I will Murphy who next Tuesday.

88
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:48,531
Rym: well, we'd have to play both low-tech and high-tech Cuz.

89
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:51,221
Rym: low-tech and high-tech are very different experiences in scorch.

90
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:53,630
Rym: Yeah, I have a floppy disk with it.

91
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:55,069
Scott: I get scorched earth to run.

92
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:56,133
Rym: I will figure out.

93
00:06:56,495 --> 00:07:00,347
Rym: I am confident I can get scorched earth to run in - box all right.

94
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:01,855
Scott: get it get it going And I'll get it going.

95
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,580
Rym: We'll make this happen.

96
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,909
Rym: This will be a good winter project.

97
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:08,410
Rym: So in another geek bite because there's no way to do a whole show on this.

98
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,170
Rym: But Scott at PAX kept trying to get me to play this trick-taking.

99
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:13,596
Scott: So who owned it?

100
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:16,670
Scott: I forget who told me about it, but I think Rowan Jeremy had the game.

101
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:19,568
Scott: I forget, but anyway someone was someone told me about.

102
00:07:19,588 --> 00:07:21,058
Scott: I forget It was and they're like you got to play.

103
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:22,710
Scott: this game is to play a trick-taking game.

104
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:25,688
Scott: So I played it once and I was like all Rym's got played his game.

105
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:31,130
Scott: Yeah It's a two-player trick-taking and I was busy, and you kept bothering me, and then finally I was like Rym play this game.

106
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,102
Scott: It's like gonna be your favorite game, and he's like no.

107
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:33,665
Scott: I don't want to.

108
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:34,450
Scott: I'm like what's wrong with you.

109
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:39,670
Rym: But I was right though you were right because we finally set down to play it now first off.

110
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,070
Rym: It is a. the important part is it is a two-player only two-player trick-taking game.

111
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,093
Rym: Yeah, that works.

112
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:48,460
Scott: is it the only two-player trick-taking that works.

113
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:51,610
Rym: I know of other two-player trick-taking games, but they do not work.

114
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:58,147
Rym: But it is a two-player trick-taking game that works with like Trump and like that's a full-on trick-taking game.

115
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,541
Rym: It's fun It's enjoyable and more importantly Playing it once.

116
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:11,380
Rym: I Basically got a perfect score like I've got maximum score and Scott got Minimum score and it wasn't that much.

117
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:12,164
Scott: it wasn't that bad.

118
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,570
Rym: It was I got a perfect.

119
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,810
Rym: I literally got like perfect score maximum points every single round.

120
00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:18,215
Rym: You know what I didn't get.

121
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:20,002
Rym: I didn't get all the sevens.

122
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,516
Scott: every single just got very good score I got.

123
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:24,881
Rym: you know there's the score thing.

124
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:29,761
Rym: I got the maximum points from that chart Every single round of the entire game.

125
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:30,062
Rym: I did.

126
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:31,590
Scott: I took pictures of it on my phone.

127
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:34,190
Rym: But here's the deal.

128
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,755
Rym: Here's the interesting thing about it.

129
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:41,236
Rym: the suits like the cards of different face values have different powers but they're symmetric.

130
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:41,760
Rym: so you know.

131
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:44,612
Rym: and two You get.

132
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:49,765
Rym: I'll read this if you take zero to three tricks you get six points because you are humble.

133
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:50,467
Scott: That's pretty good.

134
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,749
Rym: if you take Seven to nine tricks you are victorious and you get six points.

135
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:02,730
Rym: If you take ten or more tricks you get nothing because you're greedy.

136
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:03,814
Scott: What about four to seven?

137
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:06,204
Rym: you get like one two three if you take in the middle.

138
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:07,710
Rym: so basically you want to take?

139
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:16,360
Rym: most but not all of the tricks or almost no tricks and You don't have to commit to either one of those.

140
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,592
Rym: you just got to play against the other person who is the exact same Scoring.

141
00:09:19,653 --> 00:09:20,034
Rym: that's right.

142
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:22,526
Scott: There's basically you have an odd number of cards in your hand.

143
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:23,631
Scott: It's like what 13?

144
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25,782
Rym: Yeah, I forget how many you draw it's 11.

145
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:28,073
Rym: I played it once and got a perfect score Point.

146
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:30,743
Scott: is you have an odd number of cards in your hand so does your opponent?

147
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,570
Scott: you're gonna play all the cards in some?

148
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,011
Scott: order.

149
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:40,178
Scott: your opponent is gonna play those cards in a certain order, and that's the whole game and You can't possibly take the same number of tricks.

150
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:42,585
Scott: so someone is gonna get more points than the other person.

151
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:47,300
Rym: so games like moo and Wizard like all these other trick-taking games scratch very different no matter.

152
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,872
Scott: all the combinations of two numbers that you know add up to the Total right.

153
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:53,124
Scott: it's like well if I get zero which is great.

154
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,057
Scott: They get 13 Right which is bad.

155
00:09:56,631 --> 00:10:01,924
Scott: It's like it's like if I take one that's good for me And that means they take 12 which is bad for that and so on.

156
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:06,641
Scott: it's like every possible Combination of two numbers that add up to the total number of tricks.

157
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:09,870
Scott: one player scores well and one player scores badly.

158
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:12,265
Scott: There is no way for both people to score.

159
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,110
Scott: kind of me yep.

160
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,403
Rym: And the last piece the odd numbered cards the face values.

161
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:17,507
Rym: all have powers.

162
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:18,170
Rym: there aren't that many.

163
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,202
Rym: I'll just read them to you because that really that's the game.

164
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:21,530
Scott: like seven is the crazy one?

165
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:28,409
Rym: Yeah, so like one Swan if you play a one and lose the trick you get to lead the next trick.

166
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:31,888
Rym: anyway Mm-hmm that is way more powerful than people might think.

167
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,277
Rym: no Yeah, the three the Fox.

168
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:37,427
Rym: when you play this you may exchange the decree card.

169
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:45,733
Scott: so like the trump card From a cut with a card in your hand which means not only did you change what trump is but now you took that card Into your hand.

170
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:52,406
Rym: yep, right the woodcutter when you play this draw one card Then discard any one card face down at the bottom of the deck.

171
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:53,110
Rym: so swap cards.

172
00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:00,103
Rym: Sevens I'll save to last cuz they're great Nine the witch when determining the winner of a trick with only one nine.

173
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,712
Rym: treat the nine as if it were Trump Mm-hmm.

174
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,801
Rym: so nine can just be like yeah, I'm Trump now.

175
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:05,022
Rym: Yes.

176
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:05,564
Scott: You have a nine.

177
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:11,390
Scott: That's not Trump you play it It's now Trump unless the other person also plays their nine which happened a lot.

178
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:14,090
Scott: And then y'all their nines are just normal nines.

179
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:28,384
Rym: The 11 when you lead this if your opponent has a card of this suit they must play either The one of this suit or their highest ranked card of that suits That you can see already like.

180
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:29,150
Scott: hopefully they don't cheat.

181
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:35,249
Scott: but yeah the 11 like forces them to like either lose a strong card or Use lose their one.

182
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:37,063
Scott: You know what you can see.

183
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:40,198
Rym: like these combined They scratch the same itches.

184
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:43,330
Rym: that like heart scratches when I play hearts with smart people.

185
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:50,230
Rym: But the seven after each trick the winner of the trick receives one point for each seven in the trick, right?

186
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:57,043
Scott: So basically if you play your seven The other person is just gonna play a stronger card and take it and get a point.

187
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:04,690
Scott: if you play a card Less than seven the other person can just play their seven and take the whole trick if the if you're right.

188
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:14,162
Scott: So if you're leading until the sevens are out, you basically can't lead anything under seven Because the other person will just you play a seven and take.

189
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:15,970
Rym: so you're in this really interesting situation.

190
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,050
Scott: But the thing is like you want to use those powers on those cards that are under seven the one three and the five.

191
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:22,965
Scott: But you can't use those powers.

192
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:27,309
Scott: in course You'll lose a point it because the other prisoners blew out the seven.

193
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:30,029
Scott: Yeah and score which is those points are a big deal.

194
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:31,756
Rym: So it has a like like.

195
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:33,963
Rym: it feels a lot like playing hearts.

196
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:37,390
Rym: Like that's the kind of trick-taking game It feels like in my brain.

197
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:44,849
Scott: Yeah, but I mean when you play the game it sort of has these two phases like the first phase of like, you know Where you're dancing around the seven?

198
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:58,890
Scott: Yeah, once the sevens come out because someone's either forced to make a bad play or someone just makes a good play Yeah, then the rest of the hand is like oh everything comes out now Like someone changes Trump because they think they're gonna take a bunch of tricks.

199
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:08,130
Rym: But then you know a strategy and you end up making them take all the tricks But the fact that you can go low or high cuz that's the real dance.

200
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,566
Rym: You don't know if your opponent is trying to take a lot of tricks or not.

201
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:15,927
Scott: Yeah, it's like, okay I take three tricks and it's like I take a fourth trick.

202
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:23,435
Scott: It's like, alright Well, I'm well on my way to getting the good number, you know, like eight tricks and whatever the good number is No, but then it's like.

203
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:25,302
Scott: why now I only have crappy cards left.

204
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:26,406
Scott: Guess what you're taking him now.

205
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:32,365
Rym: you you you you you you And I cannot stress enough how thoroughly I crushed Scott in the one time.

206
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:33,248
Rym: I played this game.

207
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:33,629
Scott: You got it.

208
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,259
Scott: I mean, I didn't win but the crushing was slightly less than you claim Mmm.

209
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:45,850
Scott: The other thing is that in order to be good at this game You have to be willing to put in the effort to count the cards and memorize.

210
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:52,755
Scott: I kept a full count in my head, which was I don't put in that effort in any game because I'm lazy Probably be fine.

211
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:55,931
Rym: this particular kind of trick-taking game is a lot like advanced wars Like.

212
00:13:55,971 --> 00:14:00,409
Rym: it's the narrow set of games that I will go to that effort for.

213
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:01,518
Rym: Like.

214
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:02,790
Rym: I won't do that in other games.

215
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,706
Rym: Like I am NOT counting every single point everyone took when I play T&E or Y&Y.

216
00:14:08,272 --> 00:14:09,416
Rym: As much as I want to.

217
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:10,439
Rym: I'm not gonna.

218
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:13,790
Rym: I don't even remember what's in the Castile half the time in El Grande.

219
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:18,688
Scott: I just I just remember like a feel like I'm like every time the Castillo goes.

220
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:28,875
Scott: I'm like, alright What you know, that's like one time two times three times like uh-oh A lot of people went in the Castillo this around or someone went in there twice in the same Right is.

221
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:30,220
Scott: I'll just sort of get a feel for like.

222
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:31,305
Scott: is it big or is it small?

223
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:32,430
Scott: I won't count all the cubes.

224
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:36,284
Rym: So in other news PAX unplugged is actually coming up.

225
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:37,730
Scott: Isn't this meta moment now?

226
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,052
Rym: I'm not.

227
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,030
Rym: I'm just saying PAX Unplugged is coming up in the news.

241
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:38,239
Rym: Well anyway things Of the day.

242
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,823
Rym: So what do you got?

243
00:15:39,145 --> 00:15:39,970
Scott: Is it just a photo?

244
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,015
Scott: An old-timey photo.

245
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:43,541
Rym: Oh, this photo is real good.

246
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:45,530
Scott: It's supposedly from Russia or something.

247
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:48,744
Rym: Well, so, uh, yes Imperial Russia, right?

248
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:55,742
Scott: So the time of the czars That guy has my mustache anyway, the guy in the photo.

249
00:15:55,782 --> 00:16:01,442
Scott: there are some train tracks and A gentleman and some other people bunch of gender arms.

250
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:02,364
Rym: some of them have plumes.

251
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:06,058
Scott: Yeah, usually isn't gender arms French people It's that did you read?

252
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,170
Rym: it says special core of the gender harm.

253
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:13,650
Scott: All right Anyway, so usually you imagine you know train tracks the vehicles that go on train tracks are trains.

254
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:14,210
Scott: Yeah.

255
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:22,702
Scott: Also hand cars like the old-timey things you see like when there's mining where they push two people two guys go Push the thing up and down right to make the thing go.

256
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,026
Rym: I really like those things.

257
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:28,590
Rym: for some inexplicable reason They were featured a lot in old cartoons.

258
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:32,481
Rym: Oh, yeah, so like you they just like they felt like common knowledge.

259
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:35,570
Scott: you saw them in like Western movies and DuckTales.

260
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:39,306
Rym: Yep, so if you were that if you were a six-year-old, you just saw hand cars all the time.

261
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:40,110
Scott: Also Looney Tunes.

262
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:44,446
Scott: Anyway, uh, the point is this guy instead of using a hand car.

263
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:45,570
Scott: He's got a foot car.

264
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:53,763
Scott: It's a penny farthing bicycle but instead of tires The it's basically train wheels a big one and a tiny one.

265
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:55,750
Scott: and then to keep it upright.

266
00:16:56,091 --> 00:17:04,829
Scott: There is sort of this tripod mechanism with a tiny wheel leaning on the second rail And that basically keeps the bike fully upright even though it's centered on one rail.

267
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:11,137
Scott: It's leaning on the other rail sort of like a sidecar on a motorcycle And this looks way fun.

268
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,503
Scott: I imagine you just pedal this.

269
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:13,790
Scott: you can't really fall off.

270
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,896
Scott: The hard part is getting up and down onto it.

271
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:21,648
Scott: But once you start pedaling, it's probably like alright you fucking go Don't need to stop for anything.

272
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,893
Scott: There isn't gonna be a train coming Like.

273
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:28,204
Rym: it seems fucking awesome a good way to get around if you gotta get around.

274
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:29,490
Scott: it's like if these existed.

275
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,458
Scott: It's like was it the only one that existed?

276
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:32,945
Scott: how come we didn't see these more.

277
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:34,150
Scott: It's like what's the deal?

278
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,964
Rym: I don't know a lot about the history of

279
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:38,706
Scott: hand cars Like so well known but these are not known

280
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:47,930
Rym: other than that I do know there is to this day a modern hand car Enthusiast community of people who build their own and ride them on abandoned train tracks and I kind of want to do it.

281
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:48,574
Scott: I want to do it.

282
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:48,977
Scott: That's the thing.

283
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:56,370
Rym: I want to do one time but not make into a permanent Yeah, and I feel like the way to do it is to go between beak it like that long train that goes across.

284
00:17:56,611 --> 00:18:00,347
Scott: I'm sure the best way to do would be to find a hand car enthusiast who knows where to go.

285
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:03,248
Rym: Yeah Joy, there's got to be a reddit about it.

286
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:05,859
Rym: so my thing today is you guys know what am I?

287
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:24,408
Rym: one of my favorite things like one of my hobbies is Just knowing about the idea of sovereign citizens Like those people who are not driving but traveling and if there's a gold fringe on the flag, then they don't have to pay taxes because reasons and There's a whole like thing about them.

288
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:34,670
Rym: But this video is actually really fascinating because this is a sovereign citizen dude in a courtroom Trying to argue that he doesn't have to pay like he doesn't have to go to jail for his DUI.

289
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:43,521
Rym: but the judge is a judge who has dealt with these people a lot and He doesn't yell he doesn't freak out.

290
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,190
Rym: He doesn't just have the guy tased or like removing the courtroom.

291
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,654
Rym: He logically like he.

292
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:55,714
Rym: he listens to the crazy coming out of the guy's mouth and he responds to it directly and Earnestly.

293
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,289
Rym: and the sovereign citizen guy doesn't know what to do.

294
00:18:59,333 --> 00:18:59,896
Rym: Cuz he's like.

295
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,733
Rym: I am NOT the person John Doe I am the.

296
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:04,961
Rym: I am the entity John Doe.

297
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:13,449
Rym: what like all this sovereign system nonsense and the judge is like Well, will the entity blah blah blah tell the person John Doe that they are guilty of DUI?

298
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:28,813
Rym: and Watching this guy like had almost have this realization that he can't actually respond to another human being who actually addresses the words that came out of his mouth is Fascinating.

299
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:29,394
Rym: Mm-hmm.

300
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:31,279
Rym: Like it's the most respect.

301
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,024
Rym: It's the best way to handle something like that.

302
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:38,630
Rym: if someone's crazy and you're willing to Address them from the logic of their own crazy.

303
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,510
Rym: It's a highly effective way to talk to crazy people, but it's very very difficult to do.

304
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:45,550
Scott: I got a new plan don't talk to crazy people Yeah.

305
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:54,230
Rym: But if you're gonna talk to crazy well sovereign citizen crazy people this specific brand of crazy if I was if they heat that sovereign citizen came to judge Scott's courtroom, I'd be like bailiff.

306
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:56,478
Rym: This is one for you.

307
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,089
Rym: You're back into don't tase me, bro.

308
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:04,730
Rym: So in the meta moment, we are going to be at PAX unplugged doing not one but two events.

309
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,426
Rym: We're gonna be doing another learn and win session this time instead of Carcassonne.

310
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:10,450
Rym: We're doing Puerto Rico.

311
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,268
Rym: We're gonna teach everyone how to play Puerto Rico.

312
00:20:12,732 --> 00:20:19,510
Rym: Then we're gonna teach you like legit how to be great at Puerto Rico And then we're all gonna play a game of Puerto Rico everyone in the room.

313
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:30,801
Rym: It's gonna be a really good time And we're doing a tightened up version of the 40 tabletop games you must play and I'm gonna up the difficulty level a little bit For it because it's PAX unplugged.

314
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:34,910
Rym: It's a tabletop audience So there's some low-hanging fruit.

315
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,617
Rym: There's no point in telling these people about.

316
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:37,621
Rym: I gotta up it a little bit.

317
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:39,650
Rym: get a little more secure a little more weird.

318
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:40,586
Rym: It's gonna be a good time.

319
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,920
Rym: Otherwise, we're gonna be at PAX unplugged.

320
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,850
Rym: just playing games like the whole weekend is gonna be great.

321
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:49,768
Rym: Mm-hmm, if you enjoy our anime stuff you may notice that we uploaded.

322
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:52,422
Rym: finally We did the fall 2018 season of anime.

323
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:59,630
Rym: We reviewed every anime that has not yet come out or is coming out just now in fall.

324
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:02,562
Scott: We somehow managed to keep this show going for a whole year.

325
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:03,968
Scott: It feels like we just like started.

326
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:07,289
Scott: Yeah No, we managed to keep the show going.

327
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:18,529
Scott: so if you want to know our Complete guesses about what the net the current season of anime is gonna be like and which shows to watch or not watch Then you can watch this video and then tell us how wrong we are.

328
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:22,570
Scott: I'll link to see how shockingly right we are because anime are very transparent.

329
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:33,050
Rym: And I'll link to it because if you really want the full gig night experience Subscribe to both me and Scott on YouTube because a lot of our panels are on my youtube channel and the live streams.

330
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:41,282
Scott: Obviously you're watching this live stream at least some of you are and we we have a GeekNights' YouTube channel But we sort of like I can log into it kinda sort of me.

331
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:41,663
Scott: It's hard.

332
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:43,068
Rym: Don't worry about the YouTube channel.

333
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,292
Scott: It's all messed up.

334
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:45,315
Rym: Don't don't?

335
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:50,210
Rym: we were early adopters of YouTube guys, and there's there's complications of that.

336
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:51,577
Scott: It was G plus his fault.

337
00:21:51,597 --> 00:21:51,898
Scott: Really?

338
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:52,964
Rym: Yeah, which is dying.

339
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,989
Scott: It'll fix itself now.

340
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:59,007
Rym: So if you follow us on G plus I'm not updating it anymore because it's going away you don't say.

341
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:05,370
Rym: but If you some Scott's channel is where judge anime by its cover is but I will link to it here.

342
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,395
Scott: So you can also just go to front row crew comm our official website And yeah, everything is there.

343
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:21,521
Rym: everything is there including and you don't have to worry about which channels or anything like that Everything is in one place including the new gig nights book club book, which is 2001 is face Odyssey Which I had never actually read.

344
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,427
Rym: I'd only seen the movie.

345
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,777
Scott: Yep So the deal is basically.

346
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:28,602
Scott: you mean you've heard of the famous very important movie, which if you haven't seen it You should watch that too.

347
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:31,523
Scott: But I had thought for all this time.

348
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:32,910
Scott: Oh that movie was based on a book.

349
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,112
Scott: No That is not correct.

350
00:22:34,193 --> 00:22:46,400
Scott: the correct story of what happened is that Arthur C Clark and Stanley Kubrick worked together on a screenplay while Arthur C Clark wrote the novel which came out after the movie.

351
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:50,450
Scott: and I've never read the novel despite seeing the movie several times.

352
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:55,030
Scott: So now we're gonna read that novel and maybe we'll see which Odyssey Rym chooses for the next book club.

353
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,324
Rym: Yep, I actually do have something that is reasonably Odyssey adjacent.

354
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,230
Scott: Does it have the word Odyssey in the title though?

355
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:05,208
Rym: No, and it doesn't work, but it is a Dungeons & Dragons book.

356
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:11,247
Rym: No I could go do ma.

357
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:14,619
Rym: Yeah, I mean look off to Monte Cristo.

358
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,354
Rym: He had quite an Odyssey getting home and getting his revenge Spoilers.

359
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:20,549
Rym: he gets his revenge mostly.

360
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,950
Rym: So, uh, yeah, that is all the meta and we're here right in the main bit.

361
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:29,164
Rym: So get over to my thing is his Rym's-kraut people.

362
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:29,808
Scott: I did so.

363
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:37,100
Rym: as you know We've been doing a panel and even though we have new like we have a new panel that we haven't done anywhere yet Called a rare game mechanics.

364
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:42,070
Rym: We're probably gonna do it at magfest But we've been doing this 40 table talk games.

365
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,243
Rym: You must play panel a bunch of times because it's really popular and like it's.

366
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:50,981
Rym: there's a lot of reasons why people like this kind But the genesis of that was a long time ago.

367
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:52,145
Rym: We were at some packs.

368
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:53,310
Rym: Was it a Western East?

369
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:53,832
Rym: I don't remember.

370
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:56,101
Rym: and then all these game industry people on stage.

371
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,049
Rym: Some of them were smart some of them not so much.

372
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:04,710
Rym: Some of them were very knowledgeable and some of them were only knowledgeable of games that came out in the last five years.

373
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:19,780
Rym: It's a better way to put it, but they were basically having the audience Say a game that they think should be in like the top 100 or top 50 games of all time and they would take that and put it somewhere in the list and bump something out of The list and like have a whole discussion.

374
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,630
Rym: and it was a pretty interesting.

375
00:24:22,392 --> 00:24:37,690
Scott: we were waiting for our panel to start and It was like five industry people like journalists and basically they had an existing list from the last time the panel was run And I think the rule was basically like each person on the panel puts a game on the list and takes a game off the list.

376
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:46,557
Scott: so it was just sort of like this evolving list of Whatever journalists were on the panel most recently, you know And then like I guess they would have.

377
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:50,179
Scott: the idea was that they would have the panel again and adjust the list every time It was.

378
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,050
Rym: it was okay But one person on the panel was really good and every time it came around to them They were like dance dance revolution, right?

379
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:02,819
Scott: Every owner strike everyone on the panel was basically saying dumb stuff except for the one guy saying smart stuff That's it was the spy party guy.

380
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:03,080
Rym: Yep.

381
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:04,630
Scott: It was his name Alex something.

382
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,230
Scott: Yeah, anyway, the spy party guy was like, you know, everyone else is putting dumb games up on the list.

383
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:15,540
Scott: It gets the spy party guys like ddr Mean river like everyone else in the room is silent.

384
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,122
Scott: It's like what.

385
00:25:16,624 --> 00:25:18,130
Rym: why are those two weirdos cheering?

386
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:21,889
Rym: Why are they talking about RAM?

387
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:33,890
Rym: So we want to do the same panel Originally for all games, but then we've narrowed it to tabletop because tabletop is gonna underrepresented still in the broader gaming discourse.

388
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:40,250
Rym: but We want to do this panel the 40 games you must play which is way harder because that includes table.

389
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,009
Scott: Yeah, the problem is there's more than 40 kinds of games.

390
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:50,772
Rym: Yeah You could never narrow it down that much which means we're just gonna have to make a list of 40 games that are representative of Something.

391
00:25:51,373 --> 00:26:02,049
Rym: so to preface this because basically we're doing our homework the kind of research we normally do for a panel as a show To be lazy and do less total work is what's going on here.

392
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:05,142
Rym: So we're gonna try to make a list today by going back and forth.

393
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:15,215
Rym: and the important thing is the rules are these a game cannot make this list just because it was the first of something just because it is like Historically important.

394
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:19,590
Scott: because I think I think what you're trying to do is you're trying to say, okay, there's a category of game.

395
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:24,690
Scott: Yeah, what is the the the best most important one in that category?

396
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,075
Rym: Yeah, like is there some?

397
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:36,410
Rym: or in the very least like we say in the when we do the table top version of this panel Is there one or possibly two things we could say about this game that are you that are unique to this list?

398
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:45,727
Scott: And that way if someone had we're to play all the games on the list that person would have a very broad and excellent Gaming knowledge and skills and such.

399
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:50,325
Rym: Yep So do you want to go first you want to take turns try to put things on this list?

400
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:50,947
Scott: Didier?

401
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:51,610
Scott: Didier?

402
00:26:54,657 --> 00:27:05,410
Scott: So since you said it why It's pretty much I mean and as long as you don't have a disability that rents you from playing DDR DDR is like the ultimate first best rhythm game.

403
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,254
Rym: I'd argue it was the.

404
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:15,570
Rym: it was the first still the best rhythm game, even though other rhythm games have come I would argue was the first well executed full body rhythm game, right?

405
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:21,350
Scott: I mean well I mean there are many many rhythm games before that and it has to be fourth mixer later because it wasn't.

406
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:23,786
Rym: This wasn't that good guys?

407
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:29,545
Scott: no Well, I mean even third mix was only a little bit good first and second Like if you ever go back and try to play first and second mix.

408
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,190
Scott: Oh, they're awful.

409
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:32,950
Scott: The arrows basically don't really go with the music.

410
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:42,642
Scott: It wasn't until third and really fourth mix that they actually started to get the arrows to be on time With the music to have patterns that match the patterns of the song, right?

411
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:46,088
Scott: So and in fifth and sixth and seventh I mean, they're still good.

412
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:55,810
Scott: But they started to add ridiculous crazy stuff that sort of took away from the purity and elegance Of fourth, you know fifth mix a little bit even added the holding arrows and stuff.

413
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:02,075
Scott: It's really fourth mix was the pure elegant and beautiful one and also had the best music Of all of them.

414
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:12,331
Rym: It was also one of the first arcade games I really saw you know in the dying days of arcades where it was one of those games that would draw a legit crowd of Spectators.

415
00:28:12,895 --> 00:28:13,840
Rym: there aren't many.

416
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:15,550
Rym: Well now there aren't many arcades.

417
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:24,909
Rym: But when there were arcades The only games that drew spectators like not like Mortal Kombat like the fighting games because they drew Spectators who were waiting their turn to play.

418
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,943
Rym: DDR drew spectators who were not going to play it at any point.

419
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:31,613
Rym: They were just watching it Like.

420
00:28:31,673 --> 00:28:34,630
Rym: I don't think there was any good rhythm game before this that used your body.

421
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:47,730
Scott: No, DD I mean, you know arcades are basically dead and DDR is so strong that on its own Basically caused a minor arcade revival that is still somehow be a little bit stronger than it was after it collapsed.

422
00:28:47,951 --> 00:28:49,235
Scott: Yep, so it's easy.

423
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,183
Scott: It's that's how powerful DDR is.

424
00:28:51,203 --> 00:28:53,050
Rym: I actually am gonna say doom.

425
00:28:53,852 --> 00:28:54,695
Scott: Why wouldn't you say doom?

426
00:28:54,755 --> 00:28:59,690
Rym: because and I'd argue good too because I think doom - actually is way better level design.

427
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,180
Scott: I think you do want to say doom - you don't want to say doom one Yeah.

428
00:29:02,536 --> 00:29:02,790
Rym: Yeah.

429
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:05,704
Rym: So the thing is maybe I'll even break my rule because I did.

430
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:06,407
Rym: I said I didn't want to.

431
00:29:06,427 --> 00:29:07,030
Rym: the first of anything.

432
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,695
Rym: Wolfenstein 3d was not.

433
00:29:09,816 --> 00:29:11,641
Rym: it was arguably not really the first.

434
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:16,216
Scott: first person you need to actually must play Wolfenstein 3d now, but it was.

435
00:29:16,436 --> 00:29:19,265
Rym: but also I'd argue Wolfenstein 3d is a puzzle maze game.

436
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:21,957
Scott: Yeah, it's mostly head shooting It's mostly a maze.

437
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:24,530
Scott: Yeah, it's mostly find your way through the maze.

438
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:28,189
Scott: It has secret entrances and it has keys and but doing was a puzzle.

439
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,750
Scott: So you just also have to shoot things and not get hurt so that you can live in the maze.

440
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:41,317
Rym: But doom - was the first like real modern FPS and it was the first Multiplayer FPS that was good.

441
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:41,417
Rym: Yeah.

442
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:46,856
Scott: Well, I mean doom - it was like, okay, you know, it's still a maze But it's more.

443
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:49,710
Scott: it was less amazed than Wolfenstein and more shooting.

444
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:54,330
Rym: Yep, also Wolfenstein walls can only be at 90 degree angles, which really limited the game.

445
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,686
Rym: I know a lot about doom - his engine.

446
00:29:56,746 --> 00:30:05,753
Rym: it is Shockingly impressive and this there were so many clones of doom - it's so pivotal to gaming and it's still legit fun to do a deathmatch in doom.

447
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:06,978
Rym: Mm-hmm.

448
00:30:06,998 --> 00:30:09,790
Scott: I mean, it's also an FPS, but it's sort of hard.

449
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,031
Scott: It's like.

450
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:10,856
Scott: well, you got to pick just like.

451
00:30:11,218 --> 00:30:15,041
Scott: I don't want to pick more than one 3d FPS Yeah, and it's sort of like.

452
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:16,330
Scott: well counter-strike is a mod.

453
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:21,290
Rym: I was gonna say counter-strike if I didn't say doom - but it's like or how even half-life 2 single-player.

454
00:30:21,874 --> 00:30:22,660
Rym: This is the crab people.

455
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,950
Rym: We're just workshopping the panel.

456
00:30:24,713 --> 00:30:25,597
Scott: You know, they're pretty much.

457
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:28,630
Scott: I think you got to play that because doom is still a 2d FPS, right?

458
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,394
Scott: I think you got to play at 1.5 Right.

459
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,964
Scott: You got to play like 2.5 D.

460
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:33,487
Rym: You got to play.

461
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:43,143
Scott: Uh one of the premier 3d FPS is which is pretty much just like counter-strike and Like counter-strike is quake 3.

462
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:43,565
Rym: How are you?

463
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:51,395
Rym: counter-strike is Fundamentally different because do drives - doom was like deathmatch multiplayer Like it had a very did.

464
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:55,329
Rym: there's a lot of things it was doing that were very distinct from what counter-strike did.

465
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:58,519
Rym: Yeah, counter-strike wasn't really a deathmatch.

466
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,210
Rym: No doom didn't have teams in the modern sense.

467
00:31:01,623 --> 00:31:02,773
Scott: No But I'm talking about.

468
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:05,662
Scott: you have to have the experience of the real 3d FPS.

469
00:31:05,682 --> 00:31:12,743
Scott: true aim with the mouse and move with the WASD Yeah, and also jump and it matters doom is so fucking fast.

470
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:13,405
Scott: Mm-hmm.

471
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:18,773
Rym: All right your turn Uh Super Metroid.

472
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:30,850
Scott: Oh, yeah, you could say Symphony of the Night, but actually, you know, I mean there I think Metroids a better game and a more replayable game Even though the map is maybe smaller than Symphony the night.

473
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,670
Rym: I wouldn't say Metroid one because that game is deeply flawed.

474
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,436
Rym: No, like it's a gets good for its time.

475
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:38,386
Scott: It is still maybe the best game there is.

476
00:31:38,406 --> 00:31:41,918
Scott: Yeah, period And also definitely the best.

477
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:49,989
Scott: Metroidvania and you know Symphony of the Night is like, okay You could argue that one instead maybe but it the Symphony of the Night is more like RPG.

478
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:55,570
Scott: ish It has these RPG elements that take away from the pure and elegant met.

479
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,321
Scott: You know only Metroid elements of Super Metroid.

480
00:31:58,422 --> 00:32:03,182
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't have RPG nonsense Like, you know Symphony the Night doesn't think of you simply tonight everything.

481
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:07,741
Scott: if they took the RPG stuff out I think it would be maybe better than Super Metroid.

482
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:08,724
Scott: It's not so.

483
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,857
Rym: I really like all those Castlevania level up your show.

484
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:12,419
Scott: It's like.

485
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:12,921
Scott: I mean like.

486
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,930
Scott: both the games are so excellent games.

487
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:21,068
Scott: But I'm just like, you know, I'm arguing over the tiniest difference between the a plus plus and the a plus game.

488
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:27,230
Rym: Yep, right But if you haven't played Super Metroid, you don't know games then I'm gonna do an easy one.

489
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,988
Scott: You're not qualified to talk about games.

490
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:32,081
Rym: I'm gonna say Super Mario Brothers 3 because it is.

491
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:42,826
Rym: I still think it is like it Redefine what it meant to have a tight Platformer like Super Mario Brothers 3. controls are so like.

492
00:32:42,866 --> 00:32:43,228
Rym: I don't.

493
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,714
Rym: it's hard to 3m.

494
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:46,443
Scott: it's like, you know people tell about Mario World.

495
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:47,307
Scott: Mario was again.

496
00:32:47,347 --> 00:32:49,132
Scott: It's a Fantastic.

497
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:51,739
Scott: It's another case of a plus plus versus a plus.

498
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,865
Scott: but it's like Mario 3 is like.

499
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:55,430
Scott: is the perfect Mario?

500
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,811
Scott: It's like.

501
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:59,844
Scott: I don't think any Mario since or before has been as good as Mario 3.

502
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:04,564
Rym: like Mario 2 the like Mario 2 that became the real Mario doki-doki.

503
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:08,782
Rym: panic was a Significant leap from Mario 1.

504
00:33:08,782 --> 00:33:10,308
Rym: Mario 3 was a significant leap.

505
00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:10,610
Rym: again.

506
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:12,276
Rym: Mario world was significantly begin.

507
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:17,818
Rym: like all those games made radical revolutions to that kind of gaming I think Mario 3 was the biggest jump.

508
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:18,359
Scott: Mm-hmm.

509
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:24,641
Rym: All right your turn This gets hard Mario galaxy.

510
00:33:24,661 --> 00:33:26,770
Rym: Oh, I never actually played it much.

511
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:29,566
Scott: Well, so I mean basically it's like you could say Mario 64, right?

512
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,030
Scott: But the problem is Mario 64 has a lot of jankiness, right?

513
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:46,809
Scott: Yeah, though I played the re-release on even though Mario's yes or was basically the first 3d platformer that was like Playable, you know, you know everyone else had to copy it because all the other ones were just completely unplayable like complete garbage.

514
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:52,826
Scott: You know Mario Galaxy, it's like all that, you know, there was a in between before galaxy.

515
00:33:52,887 --> 00:33:53,930
Scott: what there was like sunshine.

516
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,521
Scott: It was I don't remember.

517
00:33:57,963 --> 00:33:59,350
Rym: I like sunshine a lot.

518
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:04,390
Scott: All those games are good, but galaxy is still I think maybe the best one.

519
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,314
Scott: I probably gonna play it.

520
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:08,850
Scott: It doesn't have you know, the the kind of nonsense, you know.

521
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:13,550
Scott: It doesn't have any flaws or other weirdness, you know, I guess, you know, you could even say Odyssey now.

522
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,206
Scott: But I think the only reason I don't say Odyssey now because maybe it's too soon.

523
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:19,201
Rym: So I would say speaking of too soon.

524
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:22,277
Rym: I am legit gonna say Breath of the Wild Why not?

525
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,648
Rym: and my argument is that?

526
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:25,152
Rym: Zelda.

527
00:34:25,212 --> 00:34:27,699
Rym: if you're a game designer or like like.

528
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:36,929
Rym: if you're eating like there's reasons why you might want to go play Zelda 1 Zelda 2 Zelda 3 but Not everyone needs that experience.

529
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:44,010
Rym: I think Breath of the Wild encapsulates the intent of like the original Zelda games with modern execution.

530
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:46,284
Scott: The only thing you know, it's like Zelda 1.

531
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:53,217
Scott: I look at Zelda 1 But the problem is my Zelda 1 experience is tainted because I played it when I was a kid with nothing else to do except Bomb.

532
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:55,815
Scott: every bush Bomb every wall.

533
00:34:56,157 --> 00:34:57,986
Scott: burn every bush, right?

534
00:34:58,006 --> 00:34:58,790
Scott: It's like you know.

535
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,465
Rym: I'm climbing every tree looking for car rocks and shit.

536
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:02,370
Rym: in Breath of the Wild.

537
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,850
Scott: It's not this brute force of using a blue candle walking off the screen using the blue candle.

538
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:09,110
Rym: I just think back so much.

539
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:20,225
Scott: It's like Zelda 1 is a design that like if you don't cheat and you don't already have everything memorized To play it now fresh without any guides or anything.

540
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:21,690
Rym: That's a. that's a tall order.

541
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:26,190
Rym: It's a tall order for the year 2018 But also you see like what it was trying to do.

542
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:33,030
Rym: But Breath of the Wild like all the things you read about What cuz Zelda 1 was supposed to evoke the feeling of a kid exploring the woods?

543
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,132
Scott: And it does.

544
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:36,143
Rym: Breath of the Wild does that like?

545
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:37,249
Scott: Breath of the Wild is the no.

546
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:39,597
Scott: No one will play it that way in 2018.

547
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:43,530
Rym: Breath of the Wild is what Zelda 1 would have been if modern technology existed back.

548
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:51,832
Scott: Then yep, like I honestly firmly believe that feels like it gives you that same feeling of Zelda 1 like yeah Walk up to some ruin spooky ruins That's.

549
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:54,527
Scott: you know that that feeling you get when you're walking around in Breath of the Wild.

550
00:35:54,568 --> 00:36:02,025
Scott: when I went Wild when I went into that haunted forest you see some landmark out there you go out there and inspect it And there's all kinds of you know it's like whoo.

551
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:05,687
Scott: that feeling It's the same feeling I had when like I discovered the graveyard in Zelda 1 like whoo.

552
00:36:05,888 --> 00:36:11,210
Rym: yeah When I went into the haunted forest in Breath of the Wild and that music gets a little weird And it's dark and it got creepy.

553
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,925
Rym: I got that chill that I haven't felt since I was like seven.

554
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:15,266
Rym: right.

555
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:16,230
Scott: only it's playable.

556
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:17,074
Scott: I'm like you know.

557
00:36:17,396 --> 00:36:20,210
Scott: yep, Zelda 1 is only playable for me because I can beat it super fast.

558
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,841
Scott: It got speedrun fast, but still super fast.

559
00:36:22,942 --> 00:36:23,384
Rym: I'm gonna say it.

560
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,710
Scott: I memorized every fucking thing.

561
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:30,190
Rym: I think Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda game if you take all categories like all attributes into consideration.

562
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:34,968
Rym: Maybe others are better at different things, but Breath of the Wild is the most holistically good Zelda.

563
00:36:35,189 --> 00:36:36,696
Scott: hmm Are we only doing video games?

564
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:39,690
Scott: No any game any game you got to play?

565
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,186
Rym: I Was trying to think about what tabletop game what RPG I got.

566
00:36:45,467 --> 00:36:46,030
Rym: this is actually.

567
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:49,184
Rym: This is way harder than the top 40 tabletop.

568
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:50,270
Rym: like way harder.

569
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:52,178
Scott: I'm trying to think of sports.

570
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:53,989
Rym: That's why I was thinking about that too.

571
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:55,753
Scott: What is this?

572
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:57,019
Scott: if you're gonna play a sport?

573
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:57,762
Scott: What is this sport?

574
00:36:57,822 --> 00:36:59,349
Scott: you must play tennis maybe?

575
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,334
Rym: Like tennis could fit Air hockey.

576
00:37:03,615 --> 00:37:05,021
Scott: I was thinking about air hockey also.

577
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:12,510
Scott: air hockey actually jungle speed Slalom skiing I mean they're definitely bowling.

578
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:14,955
Scott: There has to be some.

579
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:15,296
Scott: it's like.

580
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:18,570
Scott: it's like yeah, okay, what is it you think of a sport you must play?

581
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:18,993
Scott: It's like well.

582
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:20,710
Scott: Yeah, you should play one, but which if you must?

583
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:24,030
Rym: I know what I'd say because it but it's one of those, but it's not my turn.

584
00:37:24,412 --> 00:37:24,793
Rym: I got one.

585
00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:26,803
Rym: that's really good, but it's it's just.

586
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:27,667
Rym: you know how.

587
00:37:27,707 --> 00:37:38,563
Scott: in the tabletop It's like I could say like oh you got a swim, but you learn to swim But you know I don't think you have to competitive The thing that takes it into game in sports, so I'm gonna say something.

588
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:41,073
Rym: the one I have that it's your turn So I'm not gonna say it.

589
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:48,329
Rym: the one I thought of is the same bullshit that happens in our 40 tabletop games Where here's a great game that you can't play?

590
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,342
Rym: Okay, I got a really good one all right.

591
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,937
Rym: I'm gonna say next Yes, I was gonna say vampire.

592
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:58,526
Scott: That's not that's not even close to must play.

593
00:37:58,546 --> 00:37:59,750
Rym: I think it is must play.

594
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:01,218
Rym: No, I think it combines.

595
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,190
Scott: you just say tag tag is must play.

596
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:04,704
Rym: I just said you know what I'll say.

597
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:10,963
Rym: some form attack Can't grow up into an adult if you haven't played tag, dude We were at a party a couple years ago where we all started playing.

598
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,410
Rym: these kids start to play in tag.

599
00:38:12,531 --> 00:38:13,878
Scott: Have you seen the professional tag?

600
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,110
Scott: Yeah, make like obstacle course in a square.

601
00:38:16,438 --> 00:38:16,889
Rym: Oh my god.

602
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,379
Scott: They put two people in and one person.

603
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,522
Rym: those maneuvers with the dude were like Spinning out of the way someone's basically park or the competition.

604
00:38:23,582 --> 00:38:25,448
Scott: It's how long can you go without getting tagged?

605
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:25,790
Scott: yep?

606
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:28,570
Scott: It's the combination of endurance and maneuverability.

607
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:34,575
Scott: Yeah, ooh, so if you don't think you need to play that, but you do need to play tag all right So can you?

608
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:36,670
Scott: how can you grow up as a human being if you went sport?

609
00:38:37,011 --> 00:38:38,620
Rym: Then I'm gonna go role-playing game.

610
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,450
Rym: if I had to pick one role-playing game.

611
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:42,819
Rym: You know I don't think for this.

612
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,249
Scott: I don't think I'd say that you know you must play D&D.

613
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:55,490
Rym: I think in the 40 tabletop games D&D is definitely on that list, but for games as a whole I would pick a different RPG mm-hmm, and I think I might actually on it.

614
00:38:56,172 --> 00:39:01,690
Rym: I'm really torn on this, but I think I'd say burning wheel mmm, and my argument is burning you must play burning man.

615
00:39:01,912 --> 00:39:04,249
Rym: Yeah, because I could take some other indie RPG.

616
00:39:05,211 --> 00:39:19,690
Rym: But burning wheel has like it has a the best balance of meat in a lot of different areas and introduces a wide array of Role-playing concepts in an interesting form in a way that many indie RPGs are too focused for this kind of list.

617
00:39:20,214 --> 00:39:23,941
Scott: I think the problem is is that it's like you know It's there you definitely like.

618
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:29,387
Scott: there's a category of game And it's like aha you definitely must play a game in this category right like.

619
00:39:29,427 --> 00:39:32,079
Scott: I might say You must play a LARP, but it's like.

620
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,645
Scott: well which LARP?

621
00:39:33,846 --> 00:39:34,208
Scott: you know how?

622
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:34,650
Scott: I don't know.

623
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,875
Scott: I'm not super knowledgeable.

624
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,742
Rym: the listeners given us ideas now anyway.

625
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,710
Scott: I'm super not super knowledgeable about LARP.

626
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,590
Scott: So I'm only moderately knowledgeable about LARP.

627
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,000
Scott: So I don't know which LARP is the LARP.

628
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,410
Scott: like if you ask me which Metroidvania is the Metroidvania.

629
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,610
Scott: It's Super Metroid no question right, but you say which LARP is the LARP.

630
00:39:50,152 --> 00:39:54,030
Scott: I don't know, but you definitely should play a LARP at some point in your life.

631
00:39:54,151 --> 00:39:56,363
Rym: You know we have that preface when we do the tabletop one.

632
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:57,470
Rym: I think I need to change it a little bit.

633
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:01,210
Rym: I think here like the first of the most important can matter sometimes.

634
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:05,101
Rym: But I think we want to make a point about for a category.

635
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:08,070
Rym: It's almost arbitrary, but it's not arbitrary.

636
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:10,062
Scott: There is one that is like the definitive one.

637
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:11,430
Scott: We're just too dumb to know what it is.

638
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,980
Rym: Yeah, so we say that someone who knows about everything.

639
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,085
Rym: so we say that we're not.

640
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,089
Rym: you gotta play an indie RPG.

641
00:40:17,191 --> 00:40:19,078
Rym: We cannot pick the one like.

642
00:40:19,098 --> 00:40:23,216
Scott: what if someone knew that FPS has existed, but like there You know it's like they're like.

643
00:40:23,236 --> 00:40:25,165
Scott: well you got to play an FPS, but I don't know.

644
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:26,210
Scott: I'm not knowledgeable at FPS.

645
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:27,930
Scott: How do I know which one's the best one?

646
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:33,470
Rym: Maybe the answer is we're gonna unlike the tabletop one will change this panel a lot every time we do it.

647
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:35,086
Rym: You know what fuck it the way we do it.

648
00:40:36,154 --> 00:40:37,059
Rym: I'm it was my turn.

649
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:37,863
Rym: I'm burning wheel.

650
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:38,125
Rym: fuck it.

651
00:40:38,165 --> 00:40:39,030
Rym: That's the one I put on the list.

652
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,234
Rym: What do you got Tetris?

653
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:43,945
Rym: the listener suggested Tetris literally like a minute ago?

654
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:45,510
Scott: Oh good job listener.

655
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,918
Rym: Yeah, no, I can't.

656
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:50,065
Scott: your award is you don't have to listen anymore.

657
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:50,406
Scott: Go away.

658
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:52,988
Rym: Tetris is foundational.

659
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:55,876
Rym: The end which Tetra?

660
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:57,140
Rym: no we're not getting into rich Tetris.

661
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,066
Scott: It doesn't matter which Tetris a Tetris.

662
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:00,370
Scott: They're all Gameboy Tetris.

663
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:02,521
Scott: Yep, that's the that's the normal.

664
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,209
Scott: That's the main Tetris Gameboy Tetris.

665
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:06,420
Rym: So I'm gonna go to a hard guard game like trick-taking.

666
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,144
Rym: you just talk about that.

667
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:17,723
Rym: I think I'm gonna say hearts hearts good as much as I like wizard and all that stuff like hearts is Really like a distilled trick-taking experience.

668
00:41:17,923 --> 00:41:19,690
Rym: There's a lot of cultural touchstones.

669
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:28,070
Scott: If you're gonna go there I gotta say and this also covers basically all roll and move games He did is like this, you know, there's move your mice games, right?

670
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:32,550
Scott: Yeah, and it's like well you go to monopoly you could go to candy land, which you don't even make any decisions.

671
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:34,849
Scott: You go to Uncle Wiggly, you know, but you know what?

672
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:40,786
Scott: I can cover all of those and get like two for one by saying you must play bad game.

673
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:43,659
Scott: Oh Bad gammon is roll and move.

674
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:45,630
Scott: But also if you gambling die.

675
00:41:45,911 --> 00:41:52,233
Scott: It's also a game of gambling but also a game of World unity.

676
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:57,170
Scott: if you travel somewhere where people play back in and figure out what version they play before you get there.

677
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:02,790
Rym: Dude, I have all these photos in my flicker of just like old Turkish dudes playing it in cafes all over Istanbul.

678
00:42:03,412 --> 00:42:04,858
Scott: Yep, that's what I'm saying.

679
00:42:04,878 --> 00:42:06,383
Rym: Yeah, that's it.

680
00:42:06,403 --> 00:42:06,885
Rym: That's it.

681
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:07,989
Rym: These games aren't necessarily play.

682
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:09,690
Scott: I played bad game with old guys in Israel.

683
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:18,394
Rym: I spent a lot of time as a kid playing backgammon and while that game does not scratch any itches I have is a mod like as a Experienced season game design.

684
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,741
Rym: like dude that gammon is still like.

685
00:42:20,761 --> 00:42:23,268
Rym: I'm glad I spent a lot of time playing backgammon as a kid.

686
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:23,649
Rym: Mm-hmm.

687
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:26,430
Rym: So we were gonna table talk for a while.

688
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,050
Rym: I should go back into a video game or something.

689
00:42:28,414 --> 00:42:29,749
Rym: This gets hard to do in a hurry.

690
00:42:30,312 --> 00:42:37,496
Scott: Like you think it'd be easier to have a much broader pool to get a category and then pick the the premier Ultimate, you know game of that category.

691
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:39,782
Rym: You know what bionic fucking commando.

692
00:42:39,802 --> 00:42:41,146
Rym: You just picking games you like.

693
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:44,896
Scott: that's not the odds not the Top game in any category.

694
00:42:44,936 --> 00:42:48,025
Scott: No, I'm gonna say rearmed because the top game in any category.

695
00:42:48,226 --> 00:42:52,204
Scott: now because it's just a platform We might have Mega Man 2 is the same category in his way.

696
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:52,989
Scott: better name.

697
00:42:53,552 --> 00:42:55,940
Rym: Another game in the genre of.

698
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,104
Rym: you can't jump.

699
00:42:57,345 --> 00:42:58,489
Rym: Here's a grappling arm.

700
00:43:00,172 --> 00:43:01,399
Scott: You're just picking games you like.

701
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,009
Rym: now the on a commando.

702
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:09,570
Rym: I don't think the original NES game you could skip but rearmed is both this perfect reimplementation.

703
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,840
Scott: I'm not saying it's a bad game.

704
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,318
Scott: I'm saying it is not the Best game in any category.

705
00:43:14,439 --> 00:43:16,446
Rym: I'm saying this list has to be arbitrary.

706
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:17,330
Rym: There's no way to do it.

707
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:19,880
Scott: I think everyone should I say the gate the category.

708
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,656
Scott: the winner of that category would be a Different game with platform.

709
00:43:23,676 --> 00:43:26,268
Scott: You could even just say the Super Metroid just covers that you don't even need.

710
00:43:26,288 --> 00:43:32,442
Scott: no I'd say they're fundamentally different games because honestly I Respect super mature not far enough from each other.

711
00:43:32,482 --> 00:43:33,627
Rym: I respect Super Metroid.

712
00:43:33,687 --> 00:43:39,064
Rym: I don't like Super But by a commando, holy fuck That was mine.

713
00:43:39,105 --> 00:43:41,716
Scott: I picked it Rym's of favorite game list.

714
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:42,498
Rym: No, it's not.

715
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:45,810
Rym: I've got thank you hearts ain't necessarily my favorite game.

716
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:46,834
Rym: Anyway, that's your turn.

717
00:43:47,075 --> 00:43:48,160
Scott: Those are Rym just picks rooms.

718
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,370
Rym: favorite games got to pick something arbitrary.

719
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:51,875
Scott: Yeah, that's not arbitrary.

720
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:56,984
Rym: if I say Street Fighter 2 Oh Strange she has original or championship edition.

721
00:43:57,124 --> 00:43:57,627
Scott: It does either.

722
00:43:57,687 --> 00:43:58,150
Scott: one is fine.

723
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:03,769
Scott: Any anything that says Street Fighter 2 on it between Street Fighter 2 that only had eight characters all the way up to?

724
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,740
Scott: Super Street Fighter 2 turbo any one of those.

725
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:08,486
Scott: they're all Street Fighter 2.

726
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:09,911
Rym: so why Street Fighter 2 Cuz?

727
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:14,003
Scott: Street Fighter 2 is the main fighting game of all time.

728
00:44:14,364 --> 00:44:21,295
Scott: every fighting game since Street Fighter 2 is based on Street Fighter 2. now Bushido blade She's not.

729
00:44:21,436 --> 00:44:23,467
Rym: I'm not putting Bushido blade on the list, even though I like it.

730
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:25,672
Rym: Don't worry Right.

731
00:44:25,852 --> 00:44:26,915
Scott: It's like really.

732
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:32,130
Scott: you could consider every fighting game after Street Fighter 2 to just be a sequel to Street Fighter 2.

733
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,946
Scott: No every 2d one, right?

734
00:44:35,751 --> 00:44:36,957
Rym: Whoo, this gets hard.

735
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:37,861
Rym: I'm gonna suck.

736
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:39,027
Rym: They're gonna go with arcade game.

737
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:47,558
Rym: That isn't DDR But there's a lot of arcade games that are fundamental or important But they're not actually fun or they live.

738
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:50,286
Rym: they could not hold up to any modern sensibility at all.

739
00:44:50,828 --> 00:44:51,530
Rym: So it gets hard.

740
00:44:51,711 --> 00:44:51,993
Scott: It's not.

741
00:44:52,033 --> 00:44:52,999
Scott: it's a game that it's.

742
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,981
Rym: pick a category and say okay I think we gotta get away from category and treat this a little differently.

743
00:44:57,243 --> 00:44:58,047
Scott: No, I think you're just.

744
00:44:58,067 --> 00:44:58,770
Scott: you're just failing.

745
00:44:58,830 --> 00:44:59,313
Scott: I got plenty.

746
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:02,290
Scott: I just pick a category and then I know the best game in that category.

747
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,407
Rym: Yeah, best the category of can't jump bionic arm.

748
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:07,511
Scott: That's not Game.

749
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:09,178
Rym: I don't know why you're having a hard time with this.

750
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,995
Rym: Some sort of other sporty thing.

751
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:21,210
Rym: cuz tag is pretty fundamental, but there are other sport type games like cycling stuff.

752
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,498
Scott: You don't need to ride in a race though.

753
00:45:24,518 --> 00:45:30,475
Scott: Yeah and saying I need to have ridden a bike if able That's not a game.

754
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:30,776
Rym: that's the.

755
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:31,860
Rym: yeah, we're definitely has to be game.

756
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,490
Rym: we're talking about games that have some form of competition.

757
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:34,993
Rym: You know what?

758
00:45:35,656 --> 00:45:37,305
Rym: Maybe I'll go with a non-competitive game.

759
00:45:37,325 --> 00:45:38,150
Rym: That's still a game.

760
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:43,449
Scott: Actually say why are you stretching so deep when you haven't even skimmed the surface yet?

761
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:46,821
Rym: But cuz I could go something like dixit like that kind of game.

762
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:48,827
Scott: No dixit is not a must-play game.

763
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,495
Scott: No, that's not a must-play game.

764
00:45:51,575 --> 00:45:52,578
Rym: I we did.

765
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:54,082
Rym: Yeah, I think that's a must-play game.

766
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:56,990
Rym: They're very illustrative of fundamental points on gaming.

767
00:46:00,744 --> 00:46:02,860
Rym: Mmm old console games are tough cuz I don't know.

768
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,633
Rym: I haven't such a hard time now trying to think of something that breaks from.

769
00:46:05,915 --> 00:46:06,980
Rym: I see a lot of paths to go.

770
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,624
Rym: I'm trying to find up.

771
00:46:07,725 --> 00:46:08,712
Rym: I'm trying to find a new path.

772
00:46:08,772 --> 00:46:11,609
Scott: I could do like 10 in a row Alright, then I'll guess I'll go.

773
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,639
Rym: I'll go arbitrary again.

774
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:15,946
Rym: Let's go back into tabletop.

775
00:46:16,267 --> 00:46:17,170
Rym: Let's pick a euro.

776
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,140
Rym: I think if I had to pick a euro like one of those euros.

777
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:23,455
Rym: I'm gonna come back to Tigger's and Euphrates.

778
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:23,999
Scott: Why wouldn't you?

779
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:26,808
Scott: That's obvious, yeah, cuz it's.

780
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:30,060
Rym: it's the one why and why we haven't played enough to understand.

781
00:46:30,341 --> 00:46:32,968
Rym: T&E has stood the goddamn test of time.

782
00:46:32,988 --> 00:46:33,429
Rym: That's right.

783
00:46:34,211 --> 00:46:34,552
Scott: All right.

784
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:38,903
Scott: Let's see walk sideways and hit things games Streets of Rage.

785
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:40,849
Rym: Streets of Rage is kind of bad.

786
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,100
Scott: What walk sideways and hit things game is not bad?

787
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,071
Rym: Oh, yeah, that's my point.

788
00:46:46,091 --> 00:46:47,380
Rym: Why do you need to play one to know?

789
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,060
Scott: I think you need to play a walk sideways and hit things game.

790
00:46:50,161 --> 00:46:53,820
Scott: You should play Streets of Rage which is the best one and has the most bump in music.

791
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,540
Rym: Why not River City Ransom which has much more game?

792
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,313
Scott: River City Ransom is RPG and is not like all the other.

793
00:47:00,413 --> 00:47:01,758
Scott: walk sideways and hit things games.

794
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:09,280
Rym: Hmm All right, so along those lines then Sport games like console or PC games that are like the football game.

795
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:15,486
Rym: No, it's my turn and I'm gonna say Because ice hockey?

796
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:17,674
Scott: I don't think you might even though ice hockey is good.

797
00:47:17,694 --> 00:47:19,160
Scott: I don't think you must play ice.

798
00:47:19,281 --> 00:47:20,289
Rym: I'm gonna say something though.

799
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:27,000
Rym: name an Actually better ice hockey video game NHL 94. that game's not good.

800
00:47:27,281 --> 00:47:31,155
Rym: When was the last time you played NHL 97 or whatever 94 recently?

801
00:47:31,396 --> 00:47:31,938
Rym: Yeah, do you remember?

802
00:47:32,138 --> 00:47:32,580
Rym: What's different?

803
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,744
Rym: I don't remember 94.

804
00:47:33,744 --> 00:47:34,848
Rym: I remember 97.

805
00:47:34,848 --> 00:47:36,013
Scott: NHL 94 is the best one.

806
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:36,615
Rym: Is it?

807
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:36,977
Scott: Yep.

808
00:47:37,057 --> 00:47:37,559
Rym: Is it really?

809
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:39,166
Rym: Yep Is it better than ice hockey?

810
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:42,040
Rym: Yep, if we were gonna play an ice hockey game right now, you'd rather play that.

811
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:42,662
Scott: Yeah, why not?

812
00:47:43,023 --> 00:47:46,916
Scott: Because I don't remember NHL 9 hockey is not only looks like ice hockey.

813
00:47:47,177 --> 00:47:49,203
Scott: It's a great game It's fun, but it's not.

814
00:47:49,765 --> 00:47:51,570
Scott: it's not actually like super.

815
00:47:51,691 --> 00:47:54,298
Rym: Oh, yeah NHL 94 is before they change the views.

816
00:47:54,479 --> 00:48:00,042
Rym: All right All right I can see that but I'm going with ice hockey because it's such a pure During.

817
00:48:00,323 --> 00:48:05,460
Rym: it's in that same category is like super dodgeball or windjammers like those very direct competitive games.

818
00:48:06,305 --> 00:48:10,671
Rym: All right your turn we don't have to go till 40 We're gonna stop when we hit the end of the time here right?

819
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:11,695
Scott: Mario Kart.

820
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:13,262
Rym: Oh Which one?

821
00:48:13,283 --> 00:48:18,603
Rym: because honestly the original Mario Kart is not worth Ever playing.

822
00:48:18,643 --> 00:48:23,100
Scott: Well, I mean if you ask Scott, it's it's Mario Kart Super Circuit for the Game Boy Advance.

823
00:48:23,361 --> 00:48:27,535
Scott: Yeah, I kind of agree with you, but that's the best Mario Kart because of the skill.

824
00:48:27,555 --> 00:48:28,800
Scott: That's the skill Mario Kart.

825
00:48:29,002 --> 00:48:38,100
Scott: I'm putting that whole one down in detail But the I think you know, you just really does it matter which one as the n64 when I say is the worst.

826
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:42,740
Scott: So it's like in the SNES one, even though it was the first one is not good.

827
00:48:43,142 --> 00:48:53,200
Scott: so pretty much anything after the N64 the Wii or the GameCube or the the switch or the DS or no any one of those is fine.

828
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,675
Rym: All right I'm gonna say an arcade game like classic arcade and I'm going with Dig Dug.

829
00:48:59,776 --> 00:49:04,435
Rym: Dig Dug because Dig Dug We haven't dealt like the bottom is not really me.

830
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:05,460
Scott: Dig Dug is our game.

831
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,708
Scott: But I mean, I think space invaders over Dig Dug.

832
00:49:07,728 --> 00:49:10,377
Scott: I think Dig Dug is Malaga over either one.

833
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:12,440
Rym: Yeah I feel like they're different.

834
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:13,362
Scott: Yeah, they are.

835
00:49:13,403 --> 00:49:17,975
Scott: but the thing is every back in those days every game was different right.

836
00:49:18,336 --> 00:49:23,720
Scott: so you can't you can't just be like Oh, you have to play every single old classic arcade game because each one was unique.

837
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:25,973
Rym: Yeah, so that's why I got it at some point.

838
00:49:26,073 --> 00:49:26,918
Rym: arbitrarily pick one.

839
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:30,078
Scott: I would arbitrarily pick Galaga over Dig Dug even though.

840
00:49:31,223 --> 00:49:35,980
Rym: But I feel like for a modern person with modern gaming sensibilities you sound from a Dig Dug.

841
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:40,140
Rym: They'll get more out of the experience than they will out of Galaga.

842
00:49:40,662 --> 00:49:44,600
Scott: That's cuz you know until they realize you can capture a ship then the eyes of the whole.

843
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:53,670
Rym: There's been a lot of modern schmup remakes or just fucking pac-man miss pac-man Miss pac-man's better than pac-man miss pac-man.

844
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,518
Rym: Is that yours want to put that on here?

845
00:49:55,538 --> 00:49:56,284
Rym: - no It's saying.

846
00:49:56,305 --> 00:49:57,480
Scott: sure please dig dug in this bag.

847
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:02,176
Rym: I will say miss pac-man is objectively better than pac-man like in every possible way obviously in fact.

848
00:50:02,276 --> 00:50:09,638
Rym: actually the Atari 7800 miss pac-man is way good Like way good, it's not as good as arcade miss pac-man.

849
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:13,154
Rym: anyway I said Dig Dug where we can do like a couple more then we're gonna stop.

850
00:50:13,435 --> 00:50:14,700
Scott: What are the categories we got here?

851
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,523
Scott: I just did racing That's right.

852
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:20,115
Scott: Mario Kart's better than all your forces and your Gran Turismo.

853
00:50:20,135 --> 00:50:27,559
Scott: Yeah I'm gonna say I think F-Zero wasn't like revolutionary, but you got to play a Final Fantasy 6 bitches.

854
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,888
Scott: Or Chrono Trigger is tough call.

855
00:50:30,551 --> 00:50:33,020
Scott: Yeah, you know let's say Chrono Trigger.

856
00:50:33,602 --> 00:50:37,352
Scott: I think Chrono Trigger because Final Fantasy 6 edges out by the tiniest bit.

857
00:50:37,673 --> 00:50:46,360
Rym: Here's why I'd say Final Fantasy 6 Does focus a lot more if you play the legit version at least like 4n6 a lot more on.

858
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,920
Rym: There's a lot of like tactical level up stuff and like strategy and fighting and it is way longer.

859
00:50:51,361 --> 00:50:56,897
Rym: Chrono Trigger has a lot more emotional resonance per unit time spent playing.

860
00:50:56,938 --> 00:50:57,760
Scott: you got to play Chrono Trigger.

861
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,778
Rym: Yeah, like Chrono Trigger is such.

862
00:51:00,603 --> 00:51:01,951
Rym: Actually I saw a great essay.

863
00:51:01,972 --> 00:51:04,565
Scott: if you're gonna play one JRPG It's Chrono Trigger.

864
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:14,480
Scott: if you're gonna play two JRPGs it's Final Fantasy 6 and if you're gonna play three It's Super Mario's Paper Mario Thousand-Year Door, and that's you don't need to play any other JRPG garbage.

865
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:23,720
Rym: We've gone on for Basically an entire GeekNights show, so I think we'll just stop here with the list we arbitrarily came up with.

866
00:51:24,062 --> 00:51:26,151
Scott: Why don't you play some games?

867
00:51:26,332 --> 00:51:28,240
Rym: you got some shade for a particular choice?

868
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,107
Rym: You made in terms of Streets of Rage here.

869
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:30,509
Scott: What's wrong?

870
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:31,673
Scott: What sideways walk?

871
00:51:31,754 --> 00:51:32,818
Scott: What sideways and beat things up?

872
00:51:32,838 --> 00:51:33,360
Scott: game is better.

873
00:51:33,683 --> 00:51:34,430
Rym: I'm gonna really see.

874
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:37,676
Rym: let me go back to this here Too wrong in a row for Scott.

875
00:51:37,696 --> 00:51:40,846
Rym: Let's see Doo doo doo.

876
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:45,220
Rym: Streets of Rage, but not Streets of Rage 2. what the hell Scott.

877
00:51:45,341 --> 00:51:45,663
Scott: That's right.

878
00:51:45,683 --> 00:51:48,781
Scott: Streets of Rage 1 has more bumping music than Streets of Rage 2.

879
00:51:48,781 --> 00:51:50,788
Rym: Actually Streets of Rage on the GBA was not.

880
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:54,100
Scott: the music in Streets of Rage 2 is non bumping the game of gear.

881
00:51:54,301 --> 00:51:54,703
Rym: You know what.

882
00:51:54,884 --> 00:51:56,292
Rym: we're gonna do one more, and then we'll stop.

883
00:51:56,553 --> 00:52:09,559
Rym: I am gonna say Advance Wars Because there wasn't because that genre culminated and ended with Advance Wars and no one's ever been able to make something better than Advance Wars Civilization any one of them even more even one doesn't matter.

884
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:11,365
Rym: Yep, all right.

885
00:52:11,385 --> 00:52:12,489
Rym: We're getting there at that point.

886
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:15,360
Rym: You started into got a second for you master of Orion or you.

887
00:52:16,442 --> 00:52:18,029
Scott: You don't got to play master right if you played sieve.

888
00:52:18,612 --> 00:52:19,597
Rym: Yeah, I think that's true.

889
00:52:19,818 --> 00:52:20,200
Scott: You must play.

890
00:52:21,202 --> 00:52:23,151
Rym: I will stop because I'm running out of steam here, and I'm tired.

891
00:52:23,593 --> 00:52:24,838
Scott: I got all the steam I can get going.

892
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:26,442
Scott: I'm more knowledgeable with me.

893
00:52:32,515 --> 00:52:35,060
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

894
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:39,957
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

895
00:52:40,177 --> 00:52:42,124
Scott: be sure to visit our Website at front row.

896
00:52:42,164 --> 00:52:45,214
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.
