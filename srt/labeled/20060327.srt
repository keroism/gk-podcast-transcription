Scott: Let's do this.

00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:20,371

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,869
Scott: yeah We got some new games coming in the mail.

Rym: I bought a giant giant expensive board game that I played once and I bought two Normal-sized board games that I've one of them.

12
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:44,236
Scott: I played once and one of them.

13
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:47,096
Scott: I played nuns zeros.

00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:50,751
Scott: Alright, so I don't know who's out there.

00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:55,569
Scott: you might enjoy such Wonderful cartoon such as Voltron.

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,455
Scott: who is the best ever?

17
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:58,358
Rym: yeah Scott thinks.

18
00:00:58,378 --> 00:00:58,840
Rym: This is news.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,351
Rym: It's all him so a lot.

20
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:05,767
Scott: for a long time people have said hey Every other freaking 80s cartoon is on DVD.

21
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,251
Scott: where the hell's Voltron?

22
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:08,615
Scott: where the hell's Voltron?

23
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:09,778
Scott: Voltron is the best?

24
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:10,420
Scott: where's Voltron?

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,023
Rym: I haven't been saying that really.

26
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,091
Scott: not you, but everyone else who cares everyone else.

27
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:21,070
Scott: Yeah, yep well right at Voltron.com there was really nothing about Voltron.

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,088
Scott: it was like this shit website that no one cared about and People said hey we want freaking DVDs god damn it.

29
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:31,236
Scott: and we want Voltron merchandise and toys and everything.

30
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:45,580
Scott: well now Voltron.com is finally something cool in two hours and two days and 14 hours as of Right now, so I don't know when you're listening to this, but it could be already happened or mere hours away.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:56,093
Scott: Voltron.com will relaunch with awesome with supposedly awesome DVDs and forums and all kinds of great things just like every other Wonderful website out there.

32
00:01:56,254 --> 00:01:59,046
Rym: We'll see if it Stands up to the test of time.

33
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:09,860
Scott: the best thing about this is that there's a little flash thing on the site right now With the countdown and there are like these great great quotes on the on the official site like here.

34
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:17,388
Scott: Let me read one of them It sucks that when you go to Voltron when you go to the Voltron website You can't get any news about Voltron stuff.

35
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,800
Scott: almost every 80s cartoon cut has come out on DVD.

36
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,398
Scott: Don't let the go butts DVD come out before Voltron.

37
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:27,455
Scott: I'm getting really close to buying the crappy bootleg DVDs on eBay.

38
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:28,520
Scott: I won't Voltron so bad.

39
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:38,664
Scott: That's serious stuff right there, and this is the people who own the rights to Voltron in America putting those quotes on their site being like We're bringing it.

40
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,408
Scott: you wanted it.

41
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,818
Rym: Well at least they know that there's a market.

42
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,432
Scott: yeah And I think they're hitting that market dead on.

43
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:45,397
Rym: are you gonna buy it?

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,811
Scott: Maybe maybe there's a lot of Voltron all right.

45
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:49,213
Scott: I can't.

46
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:50,739
Scott: it could be too much money.

47
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:52,265
Scott: I might just again.

48
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:57,020
Scott: the other thing is a lot of Voltron episodes especially later seasons are really just.

49
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:05,560
Scott: You know a row beast appears Voltron the guys getting Voltron they fight the row B's they win the episodes over repeat repeat repeat.

50
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:09,113
Scott: But the first season has a little bit of plot and action going on.

51
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:11,481
Scott: so I might buy like season one and then forget the Rest.

52
00:03:11,502 --> 00:03:12,989
Rym: you should buy the last season.

53
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,898
Scott: I don't think Voltron ended.

54
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:17,900
Scott: of course I never seen all the episodes in order or anything.

55
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:18,503
Scott: So I don't.

56
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:19,609
Scott: I think it just.

57
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,620
Scott: it just kept fighting row beasts until it was cancer.

58
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:21,902
Rym: I don't.

59
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:23,250
Rym: I never really watched it when I was a kid.

60
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:26,928
Scott: I watched it other shows I watched it plenty, but I didn't you know.

61
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:30,340
Scott: I was a kid and I watched it more recently like in high school.

62
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,149
Scott: But the only episodes I saw were all.

63
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:39,074
Scott: I've seen the first few episodes a whole bunch of times But other than that the only episodes I've ever seen our fighter row beast episodes over.

64
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:40,860
Rym: so all right yep.

65
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:50,775
Rym: So now today is Monday and sci-tech day So we'll be getting to science and tech in the second half of the show as we usually do a little bit of a cop-out In how we're gonna do that, but we'll get to that when it comes.

66
00:03:51,439 --> 00:04:02,959
Rym: now I have some actual non science non technical news to discuss And it's something that Scott actually was unaware of until I told him about it And it's not really being widely played out on the media yet.

67
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:09,980
Rym: But to make a long story short a law was passed by our government that was never voted on by the House of Representatives.

68
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:12,252
Rym: The president signed it and it's a law now.

69
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:22,215
Scott: in other words In a democracy someone made a law Without the people's permission or without the people representing the people's permission now.

70
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:23,980
Rym: This is kind of a complicated situation.

71
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,041
Rym: I'm gonna sum it up really really briefly, and then you'll get some I guess enlightened commentary from me Scott And I.

72
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:36,786
Scott: I guess if you understand how the American government works, or it's the United States government works It'll help a lot in your understanding.

73
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:38,192
Rym: you've ever seen Schoolhouse Rock.

74
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,276
Rym: You'll know what I'm talking about.

75
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:43,712
Scott: yeah, but If you're from a foreign country, which I know some of you are.

76
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:45,440
Scott: just ignore this shit.

77
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,305
Rym: Yeah, you know we're screwed up over here.

78
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:48,548
Rym: Yeah, but all right.

79
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:54,062
Rym: so this law called the deficit reduction omnibus reconstruction act of 2005.

80
00:04:54,062 --> 00:05:07,057
Rym: Great this law was the one that cut all those social programs and cut you know student loans and whatever And it was basically an effort by conservatives to say that they're actually trying to Do something about the deficit and the debt and all that sort of thing.

81
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,440
Scott: well We don't actually care about the content of the law.

82
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:09,641
Scott: It's

83
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:23,170
Rym: a major in which the law except for the fact that it was a highly partisan issue as and also it now Originally it was written right and for all of you Don't know the Senate and the house Basically will write two separate laws that do the same thing

84
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:27,062
Scott: except for those laws that have to originate in the house because they do Yeah, oh

85
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:28,787
Rym: yeah, but then the Senate will write their own.

86
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,536
Rym: basically now what happens is that they'll write it.

87
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:32,660
Rym: They'll both pass theirs.

88
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:39,291
Rym: Then a committee will get together between the two Reconcile the differences make a new law that they both then pass.

89
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:47,280
Rym: that law is than the one that goes to the president Mm-hmm, but the Constitution basically says that a law has to be passed by both houses of Congress.

90
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:48,785
Rym: Mm-hmm that is key.

91
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:51,554
Rym: That is one of the fundamental tenets of American democracy.

92
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:53,300
Scott: That's that's like the first thing.

93
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,665
Scott: How do you make a law?

94
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:58,700
Scott: you write it then one house votes the other house votes?

95
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,913
Scott: And if they both say yes, then it's a law and that's the only way.

96
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:03,078
Scott: there's no other way to make a law.

97
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:03,580
Rym: now.

98
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:09,020
Rym: There was a conflict that happened like this around the turn of the century And I don't know the details of that one.

99
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:20,119
Rym: Really other than that It was a similar situation and the Supreme Court Ruled that they had nothing to do with it and they washed their hands of it and Congress had to sort it out on its own Which doesn't bode well for us today?

100
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,162
Scott: No It doesn't.

101
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:37,411
Rym: now basically what happened is the bill would barely pass like Barely, it was a tie in the Senate Which means the Cheney cast the tot the tiebreaker vote to make it pass and in the house it passed by like 11 votes I think like it barely squeaked by.

102
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:38,840
Scott: wow, that's close.

103
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:57,716
Rym: so then eventually it gets in and they start rewriting, you know, everything to try to reconcile the two versions and they come to a final version and to make a long story short the version that the Senate passed in the end is different by the tune of two billion dollars from the version that the house passed.

104
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:08,941
Rym: and the Committee that was supposed to reconcile all this instead of you know Doing the proper thing and having it voted on again in the house and rewriting it and fixing it just gave it to the president to sign and He signed it.

105
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:15,400
Rym: and now it's law and the House of Representatives has never actually voted on the actual law that got put in.

106
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:20,700
Scott: So wait, the law that was given to the president is exactly the same as the Senate one.

107
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,711
Scott: It was not modified in any way whatsoever.

108
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:24,119
Rym: No, no, no the final Senate one.

109
00:07:24,882 --> 00:07:28,072
Rym: Okay, though the only difference is there's one clause that's different.

110
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:30,600
Rym: they think it's due to a typo at some point in the process.

111
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:31,584
Scott: Oh, that's right.

112
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:35,197
Rym: The thing is the one that was passed is the typo version not the original version.

113
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,682
Scott: Oh Great.

114
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:38,429
Scott: So there's a typo in the law.

115
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:39,192
Scott: Can we use that?

116
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,180
Rym: Um, actually there is a precedent.

117
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:48,307
Rym: It's called the enrolled bill rule and the Supreme Court vetted this out back and I think 1892 sometime turn of the century.

118
00:07:48,730 --> 00:08:00,740
Rym: and basically they say that Even if there is outright fraud in terms of a clerk changing something or just outright Like the person in responsible just wrote the law differently didn't tell anyone.

119
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:02,328
Rym: It still stands.

120
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:08,774
Scott: if it's passed and kind by the president the rule is the one that the piece of paper that was signed by the president is the law.

121
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:23,140
Rym: well the rule is if a Enrolled law a law that has been passed by the House and Senate is given to the president and all the proper Signatures are on it those signatures constitute proof that it was voted on not the actual record of Congress.

122
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:25,726
Rym: The only actual proof is the signatures.

123
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:30,438
Rym: So the people who sign those documents chose to just sign something that wasn't voted on.

124
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:38,198
Rym: Oh Because they basically they didn't want this law to go back into the house Because there's a really good chance that might not have passed this time at all.

125
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,590
Scott: Well, doesn't it need the signatures of like, you know the house people?

126
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,674
Rym: Yeah, and they signed it.

127
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:44,439
Rym: Well, the house didn't vote on it.

128
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:48,935
Rym: Yeah, the leadership of the house decided to just run with it.

129
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,786
Scott: well I got one thing to say.

130
00:08:52,228 --> 00:09:02,380
Scott: that's against the Constitution and I'm gonna say the same thing I said earlier which is that it's you know, relatively easy to break a normal law like oh, I killed someone.

131
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:05,410
Scott: Well, I guess that's not so easy to do depending on who you are.

132
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:06,193
Rym: It's fairly.

133
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:06,815
Rym: Yeah.

134
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:08,200
Scott: Oh, I robbed a convenience store.

135
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:14,640
Scott: It's relatively difficult and rare to break not just a law but to break the Constitution.

136
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:19,394
Scott: you do something in a way contrary to the way the Constitution says.

137
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:25,694
Scott: you should do things as in Be a congressman and make a law that limits free speech.

138
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:26,919
Scott: That's not easy to do.

139
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:38,642
Scott: I Guess the easiest thing I could think of to do in the Constitution that would break it would be to be a policeman and search And seize without a warrant which actually happens all the time happens all the time, but that's not you know It's not the point.

140
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:44,084
Scott: the point I'm making is that if you do something that's against the Constitution I don't care.

141
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:46,400
Scott: if you do something that's against the law that happens all the time.

142
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,864
Scott: Smoking weed is against the law.

143
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:55,766
Scott: if you do something that is against the Constitution like you enslave someone or You I don't know.

144
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:59,100
Scott: all kinds of you make a treaty with a foreign government.

145
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,608
Scott: Yeah, you should just lose your citizenship and get kicked out.

146
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,132
Scott: you don't want you.

147
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:12,280
Scott: obviously you went against the fundamental But founding document of the entire country.

148
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:14,526
Scott: You don't obviously don't want to be here.

149
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:18,258
Rym: see I go back down more to the specific instance here because people are.

150
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:20,527
Rym: some people have Said that oh, it was just a typo.

151
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:21,471
Rym: Don't worry about it.

152
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:23,560
Rym: Even though for some reason they passed the typo version.

153
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,830
Scott: It's not about that.

154
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,180
Scott: I don't care about the content of the law.

155
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,232
Rym: No, I'm talking about is that that everyone's saying oh, it's just a typo.

156
00:10:29,514 --> 00:10:29,875
Rym: Whatever.

157
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:31,040
Rym: It's not a big deal.

158
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,059
Rym: It's only two billion dollars position which isn't much in the grand scheme.

159
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:41,796
Rym: But I contend that this is just bad precedent for future abuses and this needs to be stopped now before someone uses this for something more.

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,842
Rym: Sinister.

161
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:43,765
Scott: Yeah.

162
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:44,749
Scott: Hey, here's what I'm gonna do.

163
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,070
Scott: You ready?

164
00:10:45,592 --> 00:11:01,659
Scott: Everyone's gonna vote on this law that says You know We're going to cut taxes or something and then I'm gonna be the clerk who gives it to the president and I'm just gonna you know Change all the words before I give it to him and it's gonna say give Scott all the money.

165
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:08,820
Rym: Now the president the enrolled bill rule Basically came out of the fact that it used to be very tedious to go through documents and make sure they were identical.

166
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:09,844
Scott: Oh very so.

167
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:20,107
Rym: they decided that it was better to let flawed documents get passed as laws Than to prevent Congress from ever doing anything because they just there weren't enough manpower Available to actually vet everything.

168
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:22,935
Rym: Mm-hmm nowadays computers make that stupid.

169
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:30,480
Scott: computers do make it stupid but I don't know about the computer and IT workings of the You know legislative branch.

170
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,772
Rym: Point out that the I'm not gonna get into this but it's very archaic.

171
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:43,800
Scott: our legislative branches vote in the most archaic Obsolete just and that's what I was gonna say is that if they had some awesome computers, it would be all good.

172
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,164
Scott: But no, they're using shit.

173
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:45,726
Scott: Crap.

174
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,451
Scott: They're not using anything shit.

175
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:47,873
Rym: Crap.

176
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:49,217
Rym: Is that a technical term?

177
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:50,220
Scott: It's called Windows.

178
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,146
Rym: No, they're not using Windows.

179
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:53,049
Scott: What are they using?

180
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:56,420
Rym: They're using systems that have been around for a long time.

181
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,607
Scott: Yeah, maybe someone should rewrite that shit.

182
00:11:58,928 --> 00:11:59,610
Rym: What do you mean rewrite?

183
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,413
Rym: They're not computers.

184
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:02,560
Scott: Maybe they should get some computers.

185
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:06,357
Rym: See they know that most of these people don't know anything about technology.

186
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:09,085
Rym: Hence all the Legislation that gets passed regarding it.

187
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:13,420
Scott: Yeah, maybe there should be some sort of a law about that.

188
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:20,828
Rym: but anyway Regarding this actual the thing that happened despite the fact that the president and the leaders of the House and Senate say that oh It's no big deal.

189
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:25,089
Rym: There are Numerous lawsuits springing up everywhere regarding this.

190
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,740
Rym: Hooray and various civil organizations and law professors are all over it.

191
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,490
Scott: So we will use terrible laws and bureaucracy to counter a broken law and bureaucracy.

192
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:44,700
Rym: Well, actually the people who brought this forward and brought it to light were basically washed-out groups Which are private organizations that exist solely to keep an eye on the government because we need that big time.

193
00:12:44,961 --> 00:12:46,807
Scott: Yeah, that's not sarcastic.

194
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:48,714
Rym: want to just move to like Scandinavia.

195
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,339
Scott: I don't know I don't speak their language.

196
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:55,614
Rym: So, well, I'm sure we could learn it like Swedish.

197
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:59,813
Scott: I don't speak the Swedish I know Dutch don't don't speak that either.

198
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:01,179
Rym: We know a little bit of German.

199
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,332
Rym: I think we could pick up other similar languages fairly quickly.

200
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,500
Scott: Yeah, Dutch is the closest to English.

201
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:09,299
Scott: It doesn't sound the same.

202
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:27,084
Rym: So for things of the day You all know that I at least currently work for IBM and I'll tell you this that there are based to basic Help desk numbers that we call internally at IBM.

203
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:41,956
Rym: there is a 1-888 IBM help which is for normal tech support II crap and 1-800 IBM serve which is like I'm a real IBM or I need a new Dasty unit for this server, whatever.

204
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:47,310
Scott: So these are things that IBM employees call not things that IBM customers call.

205
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:52,229
Rym: Well, I was about to say that actually one of them the normal tech support crap.

206
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,549
Rym: one Anyone can call and in fact anyone can call the other one, too.

207
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:57,214
Rym: I just I work for IBM.

208
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,338
Rym: So we call them internally.

209
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:01,507
Rym: Ah, but anyway, the thing is it's 1-888 IBM help.

210
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:07,025
Rym: It used to be as in while I worked here not too long ago 1-800 IBM help.

211
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,319
Scott: Did they not pay the 800 phone number bill or something?

212
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,084
Rym: No, nothing like that.

213
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:14,770
Rym: Just let me finish my story.

214
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:16,582
Rym: How do I keep interrupting?

215
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:17,609
Rym: You don't know anything about this?

216
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:35,910
Rym: So a while ago I mean I used to call 1-800 IBM help to get various things and not too long ago someone in our department called 1-800 IBM help not knowing that it had been changed to 1-888 IBM help and We discovered that 1-800 IBM help is now a phone sex line

217
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:37,174
Scott: Awesome.

218
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:43,904
Rym: So when they changed the number and got rid of the old one Someone must have just bought it either on purpose or it was just reallocated.

219
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:44,506
Rym: and they got it.

220
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:56,285
Rym: because I know 800 numbers are kind of scarce and Yeah, it's still published on a great number of internal documents as a phone number to call for help I just lead is leading to great amounts of hilarity.

221
00:14:56,466 --> 00:15:00,480
Rym: double awesome Dig has a story on it, which is what I linked to.

222
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,991
Rym: but nine people have dug it because no one seems to care about This.

223
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:03,774
Rym: but I found it funny.

224
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:04,999
Scott: Yeah, I called it.

225
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,642
Scott: It was pretty.

226
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:08,097
Scott: it was like one of the best phone sex lines I've ever called.

227
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:10,169
Scott: I mean Understand.

228
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:11,814
Rym: What was that?

229
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:14,870
Rym: I'll tell you a story one of the best phone sex lines you've ever called.

230
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,021
Scott: Let me tell you a story about this.

231
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:21,507
Scott: We're at Dorney Park In Wild Order Kingdom, Pennsylvania.

232
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:23,961
Scott: Well, we weren't actually getting in.

233
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:28,860
Scott: we were waiting outside because it was rained It was raining and they wouldn't let us into the park until it stopped raining.

234
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:30,204
Rym: Well, that's weird.

235
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:31,850
Scott: Anyway, yeah, it was pretty weird.

236
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:45,790
Scott: anyway, we're a bunch of like seventh grade punk kids hanging outside of an amusement park Wanting to go inside and the only thing there is out there besides us and the counselors is a payphone.

237
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:50,962
Scott: So we start calling like 1-800 hot tits 1-800 gay guys 1-800 fat girls.

238
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,803
Scott: 1-800 all kinds of weird shit.

239
00:15:55,043 --> 00:15:56,886
Scott: great because we got none better to do.

240
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:59,830
Scott: and it's really weird that there's all these phone sex lines.

241
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:04,510
Scott: None of those numbers will actually get you to actual phone sex.

242
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:09,590
Scott: All you do is you call them and you hear a recording of an advertisement for another phone sex number.

243
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:13,407
Scott: They're like call this other number now to get the real phone sex and pay us money.

244
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:16,304
Rym: Yeah Well, wait, so what did you expect?

245
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:17,189
Rym: free phone sex?

246
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,793
Scott: We were little kids.

247
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:19,276
Scott: What do you want?

248
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,850
Rym: I've never actually called a phone sex line.

249
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:25,986
Scott: So I never called one that you know, I've only called to hear little advertisements when it's funny.

250
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:29,299
Rym: Uh-huh Yeah, all right.

251
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,533
Rym: All right, I believe you See.

252
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:37,629
Scott: then we this one I called and it was like so much more Crazy than any of the other ones I've ever called.

253
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:39,234
Rym: It's hilarious.

254
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:44,876
Rym: If you want some fun next time someone has trouble and it happens to be an IBM computer Just tell them to call 1-800 IBM help.

255
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:45,779
Scott: Yep.

256
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,983
Scott: All right.

257
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:48,007
Scott: So check this out.

258
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:49,572
Scott: this awesome website I found today.

259
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:52,562
Scott: I didn't quite understand it at first, but now I get it completely.

260
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:55,050
Scott: It's the movie timeline.

261
00:16:55,773 --> 00:17:03,450
Scott: What this does is it puts the entire history of the entire universe in one giant text timeline.

262
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:08,346
Scott: However, this takes into account a few assumptions.

263
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:11,356
Scott: number one The real world.

264
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:12,843
Scott: history is not the history.

265
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:16,476
Scott: We're talking about the history We're talking about is the history?

266
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:21,770
Scott: that would be true if every movie was the actual truth.

267
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:22,473
Rym: All right.

268
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:24,500
Rym: What about all the movies where the world gets destroyed?

269
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,026
Scott: All of those are in here, too.

270
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:26,910
Rym: Okay?

271
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:29,114
Scott: So it's pretty funny.

272
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:35,536
Scott: it starts out with in the beginning is the first date and then it says God created heavens and the earth The Bible all right, whatever.

273
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,469
Scott: then it says the next one is a long time ago.

274
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:42,060
Scott: Luke Skywalker and Han Solo lead a rebellion against the evil Empire.

275
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:52,666
Scott: Uh-huh, then 26 that's got to be billion trillion BC Los Angeles and everywhere else the earth crust begin to harden adaptation.

276
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:59,829
Scott: I don't even know what that movie is But anyway, it's a bunch of boring stuff for a little bit until you get to when the Predators come.

277
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:08,170
Scott: 2897 BC October 10th, bové Island Antarctica predators arrive for their feasting ritual on xenomorphs and humans.

278
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,934
Scott: 2080-97 no 2797 BC.

279
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:22,030
Scott: it happens again 26 97 25 9 24 and every hundred years It's just a million predators arrive for their feasting ritual on xenomorphs and you great.

280
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:34,859
Scott: And of course eventually as more and more things happen in between centuries the predator feasting is Separated by actual other events like King Henry.

281
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:39,070
Scott: the second plans a reunion to name a successor in the lion and winter.

282
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:40,437
Scott: I've never seen that movie.

283
00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:42,548
Rym: You've never seen the lion in winter never heard of it.

284
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:43,794
Rym: Wow Do you know about that?

285
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:44,919
Rym: What happened that story?

286
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,964
Rym: I mean it really happened.

287
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:51,622
Scott: I know about Was a King Henry the second, but I don't know about.

288
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:52,986
Scott: you know, the movie really?

289
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:54,270
Rym: what about King Henry the second?

290
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:54,900
Rym: What did he do?

291
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,609
Scott: planned our Union?

292
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,837
Rym: Yeah Yeah, we just won't get into that.

293
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:17,019
Rym: Yeah now I saw something similar a long time ago where people were talking about television continuity in the sense that What if basically they go from one show and any time there's a cameo between two shows then obviously those shows are in the same Universe and everything that's canon and one has to be canon in the other?

294
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:28,299
Rym: and if you do that, it turns out that 99% of all television that has been shown in the last 40 years Actually was an autistic kids dream.

295
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,090
Rym: because there's one show that the final episode.

296
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:37,510
Rym: You find out that the whole show is just an autistic kids dream And it was known as one of the biggest cop-outs in the history of television.

297
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:47,689
Rym: Wow now if anyone out there knows what the name of this show is because I do Posted in the forums and the first one to do it wins the as yet to be determined prizes that we've been saying.

298
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,700
Rym: we might Give out some day that nobody has deserved or won yet.

299
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:53,410
Rym: No, no, Alex got the Duchy of Grand Fenwick.

300
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:56,046
Scott: Okay, so it's all you know, it's all your prize.

301
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:56,650
Scott: you give it to him.

302
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:57,729
Rym: Yeah, I'll give him something.

303
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:04,089
Rym: But if anyone knows the show that caused all TV to just be some autistic kids dream it ended with a snow globe.

304
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:18,950
Scott: Aha, so one more thing to note about this movie timeline is it seems to bunch up around major events in history The funniest of which I think is the Titanic because it's like a bunch of entries for April such-and-such in 19.

305
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,954
Scott: What was it?

306
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:20,416
Scott: 1913?

307
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,665
Rym: I think I know two movies where the Titanic was saved.

308
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:26,598
Scott: Yeah, so The funniest one is your April 15th.

309
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,627
Scott: time-traveling dwarves appear on Titanic.

310
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:34,414
Scott: briefly All right, all right.

311
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:44,149
Rym: so it's Monday and basically all the topics we'd thought about doing would either take research or Time or some sort of preparation which we weren't quite prepared to do.

312
00:20:44,538 --> 00:21:01,850
Scott: Yeah Now if you know me or you might not know me I'm a computer programmer kind of and there according to Larry Wahl the creator of Pearl in the first camel book There were three great virtues of a programmer which he listed those being laziness impatience and hubris.

313
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:04,903
Rym: Yeah, that pretty much describes Scott.

314
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:08,988
Scott: Yep, so We're gonna go with the first one here.

315
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:12,862
Scott: Yeah laziness and today we don't really have a real topic.

316
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:18,609
Rym: basically whenever we say it's a tech news roundup That means we were too lazy to come up with anything real.

317
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:23,729
Rym: So we sat and went through slash dot FARC dig and Google News until we found enough things to talk about.

318
00:21:24,814 --> 00:21:33,994
Scott: so The other thing is that we have a lot of ideas for what to do on Monday But a lot of them require going against laziness Impatience and hubris.

319
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:36,121
Rym: either that or the laziness either.

320
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:44,350
Rym: that are the things that we think might be interesting to some of you But we're not sure how many of you would really want to listen to us talk for an hour about how cell phones work.

321
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:53,083
Scott: Yeah, so we need you people's who are listening to this show To go to our forums and also email us.

322
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:54,789
Scott: GeekNights at front row crew.

323
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:57,477
Scott: calm GeekNights at front row crew.

324
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:59,285
Scott: calm GeekNights at gmail.com.

325
00:21:59,305 --> 00:21:59,747
Scott: also works.

326
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:06,610
Scott: who cares and Tell us what topics you want us to talk about for science and tech on Mondays?

327
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,090
Rym: Yeah, we'll do it, but we need some guidance here.

328
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,779
Rym: Otherwise, you're gonna get an hour of us talking about how cell phones work.

329
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:19,556
Scott: Yeah, and because I predict a very low turnout of people's actually sending in Requests of what we should talk about.

330
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:23,087
Scott: if you send one in you're pretty much guaranteed to get that show.

331
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:26,105
Scott: So this is like Total request GeekNights here.

332
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:35,929
Rym: Yeah I mean basically we know exactly how many people download a given episode and we know how many people post in the forums and One number is a lot bigger than the other number.

333
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,418
Rym: So we know you're out there.

334
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:39,766
Rym: We know you're listening.

335
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:49,529
Rym: Yep So anyway tech news roundup the last several weeks in tech mostly the most recent week because that's where all the news we remember happened.

336
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:51,576
Rym: So I guess we can start off with.

337
00:22:51,616 --> 00:23:01,730
Rym: I know I mentioned that there was that Internet Explorer bug the third huge horrible Unfixable ie bug that lets anyone root your computer with just you going to a website.

338
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,380
Scott: So when do we talk about that last week?

339
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:04,930
Scott: Yeah, is it still unfixed?

340
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:21,425
Rym: Not only is it still unfixed and not only is it existed for a long time, but attacks are on the rise Immensely, I forget the number I saw but the the number of websites that are exploiting This is just exploding if you use Internet Explorer on the Internet at all.

341
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,047
Rym: You're done.

342
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:24,637
Rym: at this point The Internet is just the Wild West.

343
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:26,645
Scott: can I can a firewall save you?

344
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:27,750
Rym: nothing can save you.

345
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:36,554
Scott: Nothing can save you if you have a Windows computer no matter what network or no matter why using the special private beta of Microsoft Windows Vista.

346
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:41,570
Rym: with Internet Explorer 7 the newest newest rewritten version it has the same bug.

347
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,230
Scott: There isn't even an unofficial security patch from some hacker in Norway or something.

348
00:23:46,290 --> 00:24:00,475
Rym: There are a bunch of obtuse workarounds like turning off active scripting, but doesn't that make I sort of Yeah Get firefox.com Get firefox.com Luckily on the feed side.

349
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:04,968
Rym: I've seen a grand total of one person subscribe to our feed with ie.

350
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:05,569
Rym: they still do.

351
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,178
Scott: I can subscribe to feed.

352
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:08,867
Scott: apparently they must be ie7.

353
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,190
Rym: I don't think ie6 five or six or it's at least hitting the feed on a regular basis.

354
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,941
Scott: They might not be subscribed and they might actually be visiting fees.

355
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:17,106
Scott: that feed burner calm.

356
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:20,965
Rym: Yeah, whoever you are I mean last time we called someone out for the PSP.

357
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:21,970
Rym: They actually got back with us.

358
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:29,845
Rym: So if you're using Internet Explorer to hit our feed burner feed We're not gonna tell you to stop listening, but they are gonna put the exploit up there.

359
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:31,312
Rym: No, we're not here We are.

360
00:24:31,352 --> 00:24:34,470
Rym: we're gonna force you because I can't edit the HTML of the feed burner feed.

361
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,769
Scott: We'll get it on on some other site.

362
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:42,290
Rym: I don't need to whoever you are you might want to run some antivirus because you're probably already rooted.

363
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,061
Scott: You might want to reformat your hard drive and install Linux.

364
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:46,226
Scott: That'll help.

365
00:24:46,908 --> 00:24:47,290
Scott: All right.

366
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:50,870
Scott: So there's these guys, you know how if you get a credit card?

367
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:56,190
Scott: So like I have a Sony credit card to get these Sony points Which means I could get Sony stuff for cheap like our television.

368
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:58,277
Rym: Yeah, we got the cheapest television in the world.

369
00:24:58,317 --> 00:25:06,010
Scott: because of that it goes like a hundred bucks for a 27 inch awesome flat glass not flat screen TV anyway.

370
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:20,729
Scott: And you can also get frequent flyer miles and who knows what they're coming out with credit cards Where the more real money you spend on the credit card you get either World of Warcraft gold or Second Life Linden dollars.

371
00:25:21,691 --> 00:25:31,257
Scott: This is kind of really good for the credit card companies because basically they give you an incentive to spend more money Yet they give you Immaterial nothings.

372
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,603
Rym: It's genius.

373
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:34,836
Rym: I Say more power to them.

374
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:35,722
Rym: This is fantastic.

375
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,010
Scott: more power to the credit card companies.

376
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:44,417
Scott: But at the same time if I ever see someone with a World of Warcraft credit card or a Second Life credit card It's an idiot tag.

377
00:25:44,437 --> 00:25:53,050
Scott: It's like hey, they could be getting Actual goods points if they used a different credit card, but no they would rather have immaterial goods.

378
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:57,386
Rym: Basically, it's the same tag is like say people who drive an h2 Hummer.

379
00:25:57,407 --> 00:26:00,489
Rym: Yeah I mean, it's something where there's really no excuse.

380
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:13,732
Scott: I mean these things that they give on credit cards like the worst ones are the ones where they say Anyone who every time you spend money on your credit card during these months You're entered for a chance to win a giant prize Those are the worst.

381
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:21,777
Scott: but anyone who spends more money in order to get points or get stuff or enter contests is dumb Unless you're working a scam.

382
00:26:21,938 --> 00:26:22,861
Scott: unless you're working escape.

383
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,850
Scott: You got a scam going on way to go.

384
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:31,940
Rym: I mean if you've ever seen a punch drunk love where the guy does the scam with the freaking flyer miles Anything like that is awesome.

385
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:33,047
Scott: I never seen that.

386
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:35,862
Scott: but okay I'm all for any scams.

387
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:40,601
Scott: I'm a mad scammer Not a random as long as not a Randy scan.

388
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:43,010
Rym: yeah, oh we didn't talk about the reflex ology.

389
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,317
Scott: We can do that some other time.

390
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:45,483
Rym: We'll talk about those Thursday.

391
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:50,816
Rym: All right, so Yeah Alright, so remember a while ago.

392
00:26:50,857 --> 00:27:00,030
Rym: We talked about that new law in Japan not new law But a law that finally came into effect that basically banned all old technology and Rym said he didn't believe it.

393
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,840
Scott: But no he was wrong.

394
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,548
Scott: there really was a law.

395
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,750
Rym: Oh, no, there really was a law but the law didn't do nearly what Scott said it.

396
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,395
Scott: Well, no, it was going to originally.

397
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:07,960
Scott: then people protested.

398
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,170
Scott: so what happened is they did a slight amendment to the law.

399
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,743
Scott: They're like, okay now some stuff is okay, but some stuff still wasn't okay.

400
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:21,990
Scott: So what happened is literally People took to the streets with their old technology and now the law has been changed once again.

401
00:27:22,672 --> 00:27:24,658
Scott: So now you can.

402
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,946
Scott: it's not completely erased like.

403
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:27,909
Scott: the law is still there.

404
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:35,410
Scott: But there's a loophole like 10 miles wide in diameter that says you can rent old technologies.

405
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:44,285
Scott: so if you go to Japan and try to buy some old Famicom, the guy might make you sign a paper about Renting it but you can just ignore that.

406
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:45,190
Scott: It's totally yours.

407
00:27:45,884 --> 00:27:48,798
Rym: Yeah No I mean even before the law wasn't really that bad.

408
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:55,930
Rym: all it stated was basically that things that weren't certified under the new Electrical safety guidelines had to be recertified to be resold.

409
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:58,357
Scott: Yeah, but it also retail space.

410
00:27:58,657 --> 00:28:00,964
Rym: it also didn't really affect private consumers that much.

411
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:01,726
Scott: well it did.

412
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:08,910
Scott: it made a lot of things that Already existed like we're never gonna be certified again because they're unsafe including

413
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:11,516
Rym: The uncertified it

414
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:12,601
Scott: was okay to only just

415
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:14,630
Rym: couldn't be sold in retail spaces, basically

416
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,593
Scott: Yes, but you know

417
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:19,143
Rym: and you could also get them underwritten privately and then it'd be okay again.

418
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:21,290
Rym: most likely I didn't see that.

419
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:25,308
Rym: Well, that wasn't in the law, but that's a legal thing that someone could probably have done.

420
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:27,110
Scott: maybe Japan's laws are weird.

421
00:28:27,604 --> 00:28:27,810
Rym: Yeah

422
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:41,630
Scott: but I was that there are many many geeky stores in Akihabara and such and Japan is often the only place to get many old Awesome electronics and all of those that are your stores that exist solely to sell these things and they were basically gonna be totally reamed.

423
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:47,070
Scott: But now they're okay because now they're rental shops in quotes and it's all good.

424
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:54,635
Scott: I just think it's cool that the people of Japan took to the streets like literally Yeah People in this country don't take to the streets when their Constitution gets broken.

425
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:55,760
Rym: there's a picture of Japan.

426
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,210
Rym: take to the streets when a Casio keyboard becomes illegal.

427
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,758
Scott: There's a picture of a dude dancing around with this Casio keyboard.

428
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:04,108
Scott: I think he's a musician in the street with Casio keyboard.

429
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:04,670
Scott: It's awesome.

430
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:07,010
Rym: So, uh, I'm out.

431
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:22,329
Rym: I know a while ago we were talking about campaign finance law and how there was a move to Basically censor the internet and force bloggers to count anything They say politically as though it were campaign contributions and various things like that.

432
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:25,399
Rym: It was decided today that no that's BS.

433
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,936
Rym: you can say whatever you want on the internet as long as you're not paid directly to Do so.

434
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:38,482
Rym: Hooray I believe I don't remember the exact quote But they basically said that you can't hold Certain members of the media accountable to one standard and other members to another.

435
00:29:38,522 --> 00:29:40,990
Rym: standard members of the media are on equal ground.

436
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:42,534
Rym: Yep, that's so.

437
00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:48,050
Rym: women loggers a lose for the mainstream media and it's also a win for graft and corruption, but whatever.

438
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:49,997
Scott: Yeah, that's the one thing I was gonna say.

439
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:57,370
Scott: now any old candidate can start up some blogs Make up fake people to run those blogs or hire some people to run those blog.

440
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,435
Rym: No, you can't be paid.

441
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,741
Scott: Ah, but what if they don't know?

442
00:29:59,761 --> 00:30:01,750
Rym: now it includes a whole bunch other things.

443
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:17,435
Rym: one really big one is that you cannot be denied the right to use your computer from a corporation or an educational facility or anything like that for political things as long as you do so on your own time and Specifically you can post

444
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:20,245
Scott: your political blog during lunch, but not during the morning

445
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,048
Rym: basically.

446
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:32,370
Rym: Yeah Now in regards to the graft and corruption and everything I'm not worried because if you list all the rights in order, I think freedom of speech trumps the danger of graft.

447
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:35,259
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'm not saying that I disagree.

448
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,776
Scott: This is great compared to what the odd the previous alternative was, you know That was terrible.

449
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:41,129
Scott: That would have been like the worst thing ever.

450
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:43,574
Scott: But now I still.

451
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:49,475
Scott: I wish there was some way we could make a law that to get rid of the graft and corruption without Limiting the freedom of speech.

452
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:53,950
Rym: There's really no way not the way our country's set up or at least stop it a little bit.

453
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,510
Scott: You don't have to completely eliminate it, you know, just get rid of that evil corruption.

454
00:30:57,812 --> 00:31:00,070
Scott: It should be like the anti-corruption act of such-and-such.

455
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:07,378
Rym: Yeah, you know how many laws are called the anti-corruption whatever whatever that don't do anything or that make more corruption or open up loopholes For extra corruption.

456
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:10,820
Rym: Yeah, there's really no way There would be a way.

457
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:11,790
Rym: oh, yeah people were.

458
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,210
Rym: No, if people were civic-minded and voted out corrupt people.

459
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:18,942
Scott: Yeah that too, but it's hard to tell who's corrupt sometimes cuz that's part.

460
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:19,785
Scott: No, it's really easy.

461
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:28,370
Rym: right now almost everyone Yeah, I mean the only person who might not be corrupt is possibly Elliot spitzer.

462
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,265
Scott: Yep, and who knows it's like a 50/50 shot.

463
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:42,530
Rym: Yeah, think about it toss He's probably the most trustworthy person in the government of the United States right now And all he is is the Attorney General of one state and even then we only trust him halfway.

464
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:44,498
Scott: Yeah, and he's might be a governor.

465
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,683
Scott: that that'll be something.

466
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:46,587
Scott: Yeah, we'll see.

467
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,627
Scott: Yeah Obama's a little bit corrupt but not much.

468
00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:53,599
Scott: Yeah, so I guess he's number two.

469
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:59,222
Scott: everyone else is terrible, all right, let's Beat our favorite dead horse.

470
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:00,589
Rym: Yeah, Sony.

471
00:32:01,731 --> 00:32:06,268
Scott: So Sony item number one the ps1 factory is closed.

472
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:08,416
Rym: now I've mixed feelings on this one.

473
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:09,219
Rym: That's fine.

474
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:14,070
Rym: That probably wasn't making money anymore and whatever they can do ever They want plenty of ps1s in the world.

475
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:19,189
Rym: Yeah, you can also perfectly emulate the ps1 on pretty mediocre hardware these days or in a ps2.

476
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,497
Rym: Yeah, the games are a dollar each.

477
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:23,464
Scott: four dollars four dollars.

478
00:32:23,946 --> 00:32:24,950
Rym: I've seen some for a dollar.

479
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,857
Scott: Those are the games you don't want to play now.

480
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:30,590
Rym: The one thing is that the ps1 is actually really popular in South America.

481
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:35,550
Scott: Oh Kenny, South America is like the land of PlayStation ones and Genesis is yep.

482
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:41,609
Rym: Now the reason I'm not worried about that is quite simply I'll bet someone's just gonna start a factory in South America and start making ps1s.

483
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:43,816
Scott: Oh, no, but you know, you'll see.

484
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:47,089
Scott: you know, how there's all these like the NES X and all.

485
00:32:47,129 --> 00:32:52,490
Scott: yeah It's a Nintendo consoles in NES, but it's made with newer chips and fewer of them for cheap.

486
00:32:52,772 --> 00:33:01,070
Scott: Yeah, you're gonna see a lot of like, you know Some guy makes something that is basically a ps1 for like 30 bucks and is a bunch of bootleg.

487
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:07,466
Scott: it'll say like, you know may station on it or Play play sensation or who knows.

488
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:13,971
Rym: now This isn't a big deal because the PlayStation 2 was pretty much 99% compatible with the PlayStation 1.

489
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:19,557
Rym: Yeah, so I mean people have a piece like the Xbox 360 Yeah, or unlike possibly the ps3.

490
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:23,770
Rym: Yeah, Sony won't commit to saying that it's actually going to be backwards compatible.

491
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:26,198
Scott: Well, let's talk about the ps3.

492
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:27,502
Scott: They're having a few problems with it.

493
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:32,039
Rym: All right one blu-ray is still Expensive and difficult to make.

494
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,326
Scott: well, so is HD DVD.

495
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:33,930
Scott: So who cares?

496
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,262
Rym: Yeah, but the thing is HD DVD wasn't a prerequisite for the Xbox.

497
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:37,985
Scott: No, it was.

498
00:33:38,045 --> 00:33:39,532
Rym: ray is most definitely I think.

499
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:44,070
Scott: I think Microsoft was thinking about it and then it is decided that they would go for the quick release instead.

500
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:48,768
Rym: Yep, and they gave Sony some rope and Sony must have thought they could pull something off here, but they haven't.

501
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:52,569
Scott: Yep Well, the thing was at the game developers conference, which just happened.

502
00:33:53,471 --> 00:34:01,018
Scott: They wanted Sony to plug in the ps3 via an HDMI cable to get some HD going on And Sony wouldn't do it.

503
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:02,970
Scott: They kept it on a little analog cable.

504
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:04,234
Rym: I wonder why?

505
00:34:04,315 --> 00:34:05,880
Scott: maybe the ps3 not doing so?

506
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,590
Scott: well don't the technology not not quite there yet?

507
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:17,089
Rym: Yeah I wish I could say cuz I mean I work at the freaking IBM factory where we make the chips that go into it And all that stuff and I know a lot more about this than I can say.

508
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:24,610
Rym: But I think I can say perfectly legally that Sony is having issues and the issues are caused entirely by Sony.

509
00:34:26,036 --> 00:34:28,290
Scott: No one knows No one cares.

510
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:30,217
Rym: But well a lot of people care.

511
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:35,116
Rym: a lot of people really are waiting for the ps3 to come out and that's why they might Be holding off on the Xbox.

512
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:37,650
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people see Sony is winning in this round.

513
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:43,850
Scott: See, I don't know the only people I think who see that it seems to be like these army of Japanese RPG addicts.

514
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,362
Scott: those are the only people who go for the PlayStation.

515
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:54,489
Rym: honestly a lot of Gamers, but not gamers like us but like the new generation of gamers who don't read the news and they really know what's going on.

516
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,329
Rym: All they know is that a PlayStation 3 is coming out.

517
00:34:57,651 --> 00:34:59,698
Rym: They don't actually know about it or what's going on.

518
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,850
Rym: So I don't think they realize all the trouble Sony actually has having.

519
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:11,710
Scott: I don't think they actually like, you know It's only like real crazy gamer types that know like more details than just the word PlayStation.

520
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:22,695
Scott: you know, it's like there's people who just want to play like the new Madden and the new GTA and they have two choices of system to play it on and You know, they go by.

521
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:26,571
Scott: name recognition is really the only difference like oh I'm playing it on my PA, you know That's.

522
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:40,494
Scott: that's why they're arguing of when you see all these discussions of like all the Xbox 360 It's gonna be more powerful than the ps3 Because there's people who are gonna play the same games that are available for both systems and they're not playing any Exclusive games.

523
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:44,087
Scott: They're not gonna play Japanese RPGs and they're not gonna play halos.

524
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:47,336
Scott: They're just gonna play Madden and EA games.

525
00:35:47,537 --> 00:35:50,930
Scott: so they have to pick a system based on which one has the best graphics.

526
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:58,510
Rym: Now let's talk about the technology here behind the Sony PlayStation 3 because one they've missed all their dates.

527
00:35:59,033 --> 00:35:59,999
Rym: I mean originally wasn't it.

528
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,870
Rym: they're gonna have a release in like November.

529
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,810
Scott: Well, they said spring of this year and then they find it's everyone's like you're not gonna make it the spring of this year.

530
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,573
Scott: Well, it's finally.

531
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:08,980
Scott: they said there was gonna be a delay.

532
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,462
Scott: finally.

533
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:11,350
Rym: Yeah, and it keeps getting pushed off.

534
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:17,770
Rym: It looks like now the earliest it'll come out in Japan is near the end of this year like November.

535
00:36:18,531 --> 00:36:24,229
Rym: Awesome, and as for the US release, I don't think anyone believes they're gonna be out before March or April of next year.

536
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:28,645
Rym: Well, that means the revolution is gonna beat him by quite a bit.

537
00:36:28,745 --> 00:36:35,169
Scott: possibly the revolution I guarantee I'm like 99% sure will be here by the holiday season of this year.

538
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:41,790
Rym: now it uses the PlayStation the IBM cell chips, which Independently are very powerful things.

539
00:36:42,311 --> 00:36:49,009
Rym: The difficulty is that it takes a lot of programming expertise and special compilers to write software that'll actually take advantage of it.

540
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:53,990
Rym: so Developing for the PlayStation 3 is not the straightforward process.

541
00:36:54,632 --> 00:36:59,110
Rym: It was for the PlayStation 2 in that the same expertise is not useful.

542
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:02,690
Scott: Well, actually programming for the PlayStation 1 was like crap easy.

543
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:05,850
Scott: It was literally like you code and scene you write some OpenGL.

544
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:11,453
Scott: They even had a thing called the Yaro Z J a ro Z e. that was like $750.

545
00:37:11,453 --> 00:37:17,319
Scott: it was a black PlayStation 1 that you could use to make PlayStation games And I remember a lot of people bought him and did.

546
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:20,090
Scott: there's still people out there who have them and do crazy stuff with them.

547
00:37:20,515 --> 00:37:21,650
Scott: You might even find one on eBay.

548
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:31,704
Scott: Yeah, the PlayStation 2 basically was a lot of the same but it just made everything more complicated more difficult But still manageable and the PlayStation 3 seems to just be up insane.

549
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:33,470
Scott: No one's ever programmed like this before.

550
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:35,689
Scott: Everyone has to learn it from scratch.

551
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:37,495
Scott: It's a huge pain in the ass.

552
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:42,212
Rym: Yeah, I mean the cell chips are not what a lot of people seem to say They are.

553
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:45,490
Rym: I don't think many people out there actually really understand what they do now.

554
00:37:45,632 --> 00:38:04,290
Rym: I'm not gonna go into that but if anyone if you guys have feedback if you really want to know I can talk about quite a bit of exactly what the Cell chip is and why it's powerful and in my opinion why Sony I think made a bad move Not in terms of using a technology in terms of not giving the developers enough time to be able to use the technology.

555
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:05,077
Scott: That's one thing.

556
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,954
Scott: Nintendo is real smart With the revolution.

557
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:12,230
Scott: what they doing obviously is it's mostly the same as coding for the GameCube.

558
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:14,860
Scott: The only difference is now you have some new input devices.

559
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,610
Scott: you can handle from slightly more power to work.

560
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,420
Scott: You know more memory more, you know that kind of sort of stuff.

561
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:21,524
Scott: Yeah, it's not.

562
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:25,401
Scott: if you know how to make GameCube games You can make freaking revolution games.

563
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:31,666
Scott: It's not that different except for of course There's a new library to handle the internet wireless business and coding for the Xbox.

564
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:32,609
Rym: just code for a freaking PC.

565
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:39,850
Scott: I know the Xbox is basically you write DirectX games and the Xbox 360 you write DirectX games.

566
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:40,969
Scott: It's no different now.

567
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:42,454
Rym: If so That's why you see all these.

568
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:51,467
Rym: if Sony had working hardware if Sony had had their working hardware together And they were ready to go already Then it wouldn't be that far off for them to put all the dev kits out.

569
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:54,909
Rym: put everything out Let the developers learn their new environment and then go nuts.

570
00:38:55,332 --> 00:39:08,569
Rym: The problem is Sony doesn't even really have their hardware in line yet Which means they can't really give the dev kits out and Say that these are gonna be the dev kit or this is going to be the platform Which means the developers haven't been able to do any real work.

571
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:10,830
Scott: We don't even know what the controller is gonna be.

572
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,649
Scott: I mean they showed that horseshoe controller and then I put that thing on my blog about how's a ripoff and whatever whatever.

573
00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:18,541
Scott: and Now they're saying oh, that's not the final end.

574
00:39:18,562 --> 00:39:20,070
Scott: They're not committing to anything.

575
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:25,211
Scott: They're so non committal that you might as well just say there might not even be a PlayStation 3.

576
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:27,554
Scott: They haven't even committed to that yet Or that might be.

577
00:39:27,594 --> 00:39:31,050
Scott: the only thing they've committed to is that there will be a PlayStation 3 on some date.

578
00:39:31,694 --> 00:39:46,166
Rym: Now in terms of blu-ray and HD DVD I think Sony realizes that there's been a lot of flack about blu-ray lately because they made that nice gesture of hey All right We won't do that analog down sampling even though what they really meant was all right.

579
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:49,981
Rym: the first few DVDs We release ourselves won't make use of that feature.

580
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:51,989
Rym: that will in fact be in all the players anyway.

581
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:58,466
Rym: Mm-hmm and Also the fact that I don't think consumers really give one shit one way or the other.

582
00:39:58,486 --> 00:40:03,881
Scott: I think HDTV HDTV because their HDTVs are selling.

583
00:40:04,142 --> 00:40:09,176
Scott: when you look at TVs that are selling now a lot of people are buying HDTVs as opposed to regular.

584
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:15,730
Rym: yeah despite the fact that the standards change and a lot of people are getting screwed with obsolete HDTVs that can't watch modern encrypted things.

585
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,081
Scott: But yeah the thing is is that consumers don't actually under.

586
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:21,910
Scott: they can barely hook up like a VCR to a TV.

587
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,623
Scott: They can't even get the 12 to stop blinking on their VCR.

588
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:25,426
Rym: now HDTV.

589
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:37,250
Rym: remember that statistic I pulled up months ago where they basically interviewed people and discovered that a good 75% of people who think they have HDTV actually don't because they don't have it hooked up right and it's not really working.

590
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:38,860
Scott: Yeah, like my dad.

591
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:51,359
Scott: He had an a bought an HDTV It's a Sony wega and he had this non digital cable, and there was no source of HD Content going to the television at all.

592
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:58,130
Rym: the thing is people think they see it because an HDTV Independent of the digital is a very high quality television.

593
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:02,396
Rym: Oh, yeah, which means even if you put a crap signal in it It'll look better than it looks on your crap TV.

594
00:41:02,978 --> 00:41:07,934
Rym: the thing is it doesn't look that much better with the full HD Than it would.

595
00:41:08,014 --> 00:41:08,395
Rym: anyway.

596
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:18,993
Rym: very few things actually take advantage of HD and in fact some mediums Well media are actually hurt by it for example daytime sitcom type things HD.

597
00:41:19,053 --> 00:41:24,110
Rym: if you film those in HD the poor makeup becomes readily apparent, and it actually looks worse.

598
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:34,949
Scott: Yeah, if something wasn't designed to be HD, and you up sample it or watch it on a TV That's better than it was supposed to or you film something in HD that shouldn't be.

599
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:38,589
Rym: yeah You can see the freaking actresses pores, and it doesn't look good.

600
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:41,559
Scott: Yeah, actually I think HDTV is useful.

601
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:52,369
Scott: the number one thing that I think HDTV should be used for sports Yeah, this is the best thing in the world is watching hockey, and you can see more hockey two movies that are designed for it.

602
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:57,455
Scott: Yeah There's a website that shows you Lord of the Rings HDTV and not HDTV.

603
00:41:57,495 --> 00:42:03,670
Scott: basically all the pictures are non HDTV and when you mouse over them the HDTV image takes its place.

604
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:05,918
Scott: There's a freaking striking difference.

605
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:16,475
Rym: like the thing is while the difference is striking in a still Because of the way TV works these old TVs with the interlay scanning if you actually watch it moving the difference is far less Noticeable.

606
00:42:16,536 --> 00:42:17,425
Scott: difference is far less.

607
00:42:17,505 --> 00:42:30,690
Scott: another thing I noticed is that a lot of TVs you'll see in stores the brightness is cranked all the way up because that's what sells TVs Is bright colors and hot bright bright colors and high contrast because that looks really cool.

608
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:35,630
Scott: You see like you know bright blue sky yellow flowers green green stems waving you know.

609
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:42,868
Scott: But really if you want to the real picture is supposed to be much much darker like I know.

610
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:44,474
Scott: on our TV There's like vivid.

611
00:42:44,634 --> 00:42:48,027
Scott: normal pro and custom are like the four settings.

612
00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:51,368
Scott: if we had HDTV pro is what you want to set it at.

613
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:51,670
Scott: yep.

614
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:57,009
Scott: But if you've just been looking at vivid pro looks like it's dark or something and you're like I can't see.

615
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:59,058
Scott: But that's how it's supposed to look.

616
00:42:59,138 --> 00:43:06,254
Scott: and if you actually set it on pro and leave it there on an HDTV And you dark in the room when you watch That's there it is.

617
00:43:06,314 --> 00:43:12,396
Rym: That's the real image, but I guess my final take on HDTV is that it's nice It's not worth the money.

618
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:14,143
Rym: It's not worth the DRM.

619
00:43:14,464 --> 00:43:21,550
Rym: It's not worth the complication It's not worth the fact that it goes obsolete constantly because they're so afraid of piracy that they're crippling their own formats.

620
00:43:22,273 --> 00:43:25,006
Rym: If it had just been HDTV if the industry had just said all right.

621
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:25,749
Rym: Here's the standard.

622
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:30,205
Rym: With over the next 10 years we're gonna have better television for everyone.

623
00:43:30,225 --> 00:43:31,450
Rym: yay, that would have been great.

624
00:43:31,891 --> 00:43:33,837
Rym: But no everyone's fighting with each other.

625
00:43:33,857 --> 00:43:36,405
Rym: They're more afraid of their consumers than they are of each other.

626
00:43:36,506 --> 00:43:37,710
Rym: even so they're fighting against us.

627
00:43:38,372 --> 00:43:43,269
Rym: They really have no allies here except for crazy not to always buy TVs whenever a new thing comes out.

628
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:45,979
Scott: Yeah, those guys who need that 100 inch TV.

629
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,250
Rym: Yeah, the guys who basically spend their lives watching movies.

630
00:43:49,975 --> 00:44:00,630
Scott: I'm probably gonna buy an HDTV Probably maybe five six years from now because when Nintendo comes out with the next console They said I think our water was talking about it.

631
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:06,189
Scott: How the reason they did the real reason they didn't do HDTV now is because sure it wouldn't hurt to throw it in.

632
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:10,563
Scott: you know It might increase the cost of the console, but they're already so much cheaper than everyone else.

633
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:12,790
Scott: It wouldn't matter so much and whatever.

634
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:20,979
Scott: There are a bunch of other reasons not to do it that are obvious But the number one reason was that there's no standard for HDTV and people wouldn't even really get it to work.

635
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:22,906
Scott: and who knows it would work on every HDTV.

636
00:44:22,946 --> 00:44:24,110
Rym: and yeah plus making games.

637
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,830
Rym: And HDTV is mostly silly because all it does for now at least is add development time.

638
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:31,659
Scott: Yeah, it adds you need more processing power.

639
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:32,782
Scott: It's hard to develop.

640
00:44:32,843 --> 00:44:42,283
Rym: You need more graphics and honestly the differences I mean when the Xbox 360 came out and I played a bunch of the demo games It didn't really look much better than previous similar games.

641
00:44:42,324 --> 00:44:57,849
Scott: I saw on the Xbox normal Yeah, and you know sure even a 1080p TV doesn't come close to a PC monitor And you still don't have the interface to do the PC type of games, so It just makes it look shiny, which doesn't affect the game at all.

642
00:44:58,232 --> 00:45:00,910
Rym: Yeah, and of course we see the problems with overheating in the Xbox.

643
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:11,593
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure the PlayStation 3 is gonna have some similar problem, but a few years down the road I'm sure there will be one HDTV standard, and you know everything will start to work eventually Hopefully.

644
00:45:11,693 --> 00:45:20,246
Scott: if it doesn't then fuck them all yeah, and by then Nintendo will say okay HDTV is this standard and they'll make the next console after the revolution will support that.

645
00:45:20,306 --> 00:45:27,490
Scott: and that's probably when I'll buy an HDTV because there'll be a standard and it'll make sense to buy one and the price won't be stupid insane.

646
00:45:28,152 --> 00:45:29,396
Rym: Now what else is Sony screwed up?

647
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:31,624
Rym: They had the root kits which they're still being sued over.

648
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:33,410
Scott: They're not beating the iPod.

649
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:38,689
Rym: Sony online entertainment with their Star Wars galaxies is pretty much in the shitter.

650
00:45:39,191 --> 00:45:40,274
Rym: Yeah, and they're like it's done.

651
00:45:40,314 --> 00:45:42,359
Scott: World of Warcraft killed off all their MMOs.

652
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,453
Scott: their Playstations are dead their electronics are getting kicked Their ass by Apple.

653
00:45:47,493 --> 00:45:51,944
Scott: their computers not so good the memory sticks getting beat by sanders.

654
00:45:51,984 --> 00:46:00,829
Rym: stock is dropping and honestly Mama, here's my prediction Rym's a randy million-dollar challenge psychic prediction for the future of Sony.

655
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:11,730
Rym: I think that Sony Sony hardware is going to eventually somehow split itself off From Sony intellectual property, that's not the actual names of them.

656
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,090
Rym: But I think there's gonna be a schism between the two Sony's.

657
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:24,750
Rym: Because currently I think most of Sony's problems come from the fact that half of Sony Wants to make things to sell to people like devices that do things people want and that's a very lucrative market.

658
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:31,793
Rym: The other half of Sony wants to sell ideas that are free anyway to people for a lot of money and doesn't want those devices To exist.

659
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:38,430
Rym: so instead Sony has to compromise and sells shit Shit devices that barely work and don't do everything we want.

660
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:40,216
Scott: I mean Sony's.

661
00:46:40,236 --> 00:46:45,898
Scott: the real reason Sony didn't beat the iPod isn't because they didn't come out with a Better cheaper device soon enough.

662
00:46:45,959 --> 00:46:48,210
Scott: I mean there were some pretty good Sony mp3 players.

663
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:52,610
Scott: The problem was that originally they didn't support mp3 and they didn't plug into computers easily.

664
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,293
Scott: And they were.

665
00:46:53,674 --> 00:46:55,923
Scott: you had to use the stupid a track 3 thing.

666
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:57,790
Rym: and yeah, and I mean look at mini disc.

667
00:46:58,452 --> 00:47:01,566
Rym: Mini disc was awesome, and then they crippled it to all hell.

668
00:47:02,128 --> 00:47:04,686
Scott: well mini This was kind of big in Japan actually.

669
00:47:04,807 --> 00:47:06,616
Rym: yeah Not in the u.s.. Not so much.

670
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:09,870
Scott: mini disk if you don't know is like a little tiny CD in a plastic case.

671
00:47:10,273 --> 00:47:12,250
Rym: Thank you was magneto optical wasn't it yeah?

672
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:16,970
Rym: You can actually record on to it You know but it worked like a tape in that you couldn't.

673
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:18,716
Rym: I won't get all the details.

674
00:47:18,756 --> 00:47:19,942
Rym: if you don't have one you don't care.

675
00:47:19,982 --> 00:47:20,927
Rym: if you have one you already know.

676
00:47:20,947 --> 00:47:25,069
Scott: yeah But just imagine you know it was supposed to be better than CD.

677
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:29,549
Scott: It was supposed to be like oh, it's CD quality, but you can record on to it like a tape.

678
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:32,319
Rym: ooh Yeah, it was a tape CD, and it was small.

679
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:40,570
Rym: and then is it's actually kind of handy until MP3s came around and kicked its ass, but they DRM crippled it to hell and it ended up being almost useless.

680
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:49,889
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you could have let people you know buy mini discs in the store for a good price Then copy tracks off of them on to other mini discs and mix it up.

681
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:58,510
Rym: They copied them onto computers and all it would have been great couldn't even get consumer equipment that would record easily To mini discs especially not from any sort of digital source.

682
00:47:58,831 --> 00:48:04,347
Rym: Yeah, and if you wanted that equipment you had to buy the professional mini disc stuff that cost ten times more.

683
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:07,097
Scott: of course It wasn't really that different at all.

684
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:08,362
Scott: I just had a digital input.

685
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:10,470
Rym: Yeah, I mean technologically it was identical almost.

686
00:48:10,812 --> 00:48:13,849
Scott: It just had the word pro on it and a bunch of extra dollar signs.

687
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:17,910
Rym: So yeah, we'll see if Sony ever actually gets his act together and splits off.

688
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,742
Rym: But if it doesn't I don't think they're gonna be a viable company in the next decade.

689
00:48:22,184 --> 00:48:26,978
Scott: who knows the only thing that really I think Keeps them from splitting isn't intelligence.

690
00:48:27,198 --> 00:48:28,602
Scott: It's Japanese pride.

691
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:30,808
Scott: You know a lot about Japanese pride.

692
00:48:30,888 --> 00:48:33,275
Scott: super agree I super agree super agree.

693
00:48:33,456 --> 00:48:34,519
Rym: Yeah, those guys.

694
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,250
Rym: Well, I'll admit at least I mean they're racing f1 cars.

695
00:48:38,471 --> 00:48:39,815
Rym: They're probably enjoying themselves.

696
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:41,039
Scott: Yeah, do you know what cars?

697
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:42,262
Scott: you know where those cars came from?

698
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:46,533
Scott: where they're four-year-old arrows cars Mm-hmm.

699
00:48:46,956 --> 00:48:49,288
Scott: In other words, that's like if you went to.

700
00:48:50,814 --> 00:48:52,689
Scott: Let me try to think of a really good analogy.

701
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:53,213
Rym: Well anyway.

702
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:56,693
Rym: for those who don't know in Japan They they have.

703
00:48:56,733 --> 00:49:08,669
Rym: there's this one f1 team super aguri and they are basically they only exist so that there will actually be Japanese people racing Mm-hmm, because they're the two worst drivers in Formula One.

704
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:13,410
Scott: Well, no, I taka Masato probably isn't the second worst driver in Formula One.

705
00:49:13,932 --> 00:49:18,346
Scott: He's one of the who was the one that crashed in Bahrain crash.

706
00:49:18,366 --> 00:49:19,430
Rym: He hit the wall in the pit.

707
00:49:20,232 --> 00:49:21,095
Scott: No crash.

708
00:49:21,316 --> 00:49:21,638
Scott: He didn't.

709
00:49:21,698 --> 00:49:23,866
Rym: he didn't bumped into it and then he bumped into one of his dude.

710
00:49:23,986 --> 00:49:25,934
Scott: No, he didn't hit the wall He just hit one of his dudes.

711
00:49:25,955 --> 00:49:26,899
Scott: That's UGE day.

712
00:49:27,682 --> 00:49:31,395
Scott: He actually that guy comes from Japan.

713
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:36,230
Scott: Grand Prix's like What's the JG TC and all those sorts of things?

714
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:42,530
Scott: Like they're special Japan only racing circuits and such and that he's won a few things there.

715
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:49,410
Scott: But f1 is so far beyond any other race even in the shitty four-year-old arrows car that he's got nothing.

716
00:49:49,872 --> 00:49:53,558
Rym: So those are all the major Technologically inclined stories.

717
00:49:53,598 --> 00:50:04,658
Scott: We have various commentary about this week And if you don't want to hear us do boring just like every other tech podcast out there, you know Send us ideas of what to talk about on Monday.

718
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:11,417
Scott: Yeah, anything you want us to talk about that has any Slight connection to anything science or technology.

719
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:14,445
Scott: We'll do it unless we know nothing about it whatsoever.

720
00:50:15,086 --> 00:50:15,427
Rym: We'll do it.

721
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:18,074
Rym: Anyway, yeah Yeah, we'll do anything.

722
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,959
Rym: we'll do the first one we get.

723
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:26,558
Scott: yeah if you want to hear about you know, like a National Geographic Documentary and giant squids.

724
00:50:26,779 --> 00:50:27,262
Scott: I don't care.

725
00:50:27,282 --> 00:50:28,930
Scott: I just think about squids.

726
00:50:29,534 --> 00:50:37,465
Rym: I think part of the problem is that we put science and tech on Monday Which is it's not a difficult topic for us But it's difficult to come up with a good idea to talk about that.

727
00:50:37,485 --> 00:50:38,350
Rym: wouldn't yeah the hell out?

728
00:50:38,471 --> 00:50:47,590
Scott: I know more about technology than I know about almost anything else But most I could talk about just informative technology stuff for hours and hours and hours.

729
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,996
Rym: Just today's I was talking to Scott.

730
00:50:49,037 --> 00:50:51,730
Rym: I could drone on for a couple hours about nuclear weapons.

731
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:52,974
Scott: Yeah, I could.

732
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:55,690
Rym: I mean if you guys wanted something like that we could do it.

733
00:50:55,750 --> 00:51:00,770
Scott: But I could sit here for like three hours telling you how to configure a Linux kernel based on your hardware.

734
00:51:01,272 --> 00:51:04,666
Rym: Now the other problem is that Mondays you'd think oh, it's the beginning of the week.

735
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,710
Rym: We're fresh off the weekend.

736
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:12,413
Rym: No, we're absolutely wrecked from the weekend because we spend the weekend playing board games with friends usually Mmm, great.

737
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:13,657
Rym: Yeah board games.

738
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:16,245
Rym: I consider them to be as exhausting as physical activity.

739
00:51:16,345 --> 00:51:26,929
Rym: only it's meant to lock exhaustion Mmm, and as you can tell we're rambling currently, so that's the end of today's episode tonight's episode going to bed.

740
00:51:27,555 --> 00:51:30,173
Rym: tomorrow is Gaming day.

741
00:51:30,494 --> 00:51:31,979
Rym: Yeah, I forget what we're gonna talk about.

742
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:40,410
Scott: I can tell you though that you even if you aren't Unusual subscriber to the Tuesday feed you will want to listen to tomorrow's episode.

743
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,923
Scott: Download it manually if you must because I have some excellent things of the day.

744
00:51:43,943 --> 00:51:45,047
Rym: Oh, really?

745
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:48,269
Rym: Yeah, really Actually, I have to agree with him on this.

746
00:51:49,032 --> 00:51:58,630
Rym: It's kind of relevant to technology because it harkens back to a technology platform That is so maligned that most people don't even know it ever existed.

747
00:51:59,212 --> 00:52:04,974
Scott: I knew it existed and I remembered something no one else remembered about a Games on it.

748
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:09,368
Scott: I did also anyway, yeah, we've talked about it at least once before in the show we have.

749
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:23,188
Rym: in fact It was my thing of the day a while ago because I had some video from it awesome And that was GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
