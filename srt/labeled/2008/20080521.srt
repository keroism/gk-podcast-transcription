00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,797
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 21st.

2
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:12,620
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,650
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:17,979
Rym: Instead of telling you how to get into anime.

5
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:20,729
Rym: We tell you how to get other people into anime.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:41,150
Rym: So Emily must have not had any work to do today because actually she she decided What she tried to figure out what my name would be in kanji, wouldn't it just be like remove?

8
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:41,852
Rym: Well, it is.

9
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:45,010
Rym: it's remove and she you know pick what kanji and all the pronunciation.

10
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:49,750
Scott: Pick a kanji that sounds like re and then another one that sounds like, you know how Japanese names work.

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,861
Rym: So what she chose and I think this is pretty cool.

12
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:55,450
Rym: So remove can also be pronounced.

13
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,275
Rym: Well, I'll get to that.

14
00:00:56,295 --> 00:01:06,040
Rym: the first kanji means advantage And the second one means rejoice or jubilation Which which is very fitting in German board games.

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,508
Rym: So I guess I feel good about that.

16
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:09,230
Rym: Plus it looks cool.

17
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,409
Rym: The first one's like a sword with things coming out the top Always like the ones that look like little houses.

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,012
Scott: Those are the best.

19
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:20,710
Rym: the second one is one of those million line kanji's with a million like square hedge lines.

20
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,795
Scott: How's the house looking?

21
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:22,397
Scott: ones are the best.

22
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:25,370
Rym: it's got a hat and then it's got like little tentacles coming out the bottom.

23
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,260
Scott: Well, technically is it good but it's pronounced.

24
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:32,850
Rym: obviously remove but the other reading is Toshiyoshi.

25
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:36,192
Rym: No now Toshiyoshi.

26
00:01:36,353 --> 00:01:39,483
Scott: Well, I don't know what toshi is but Yoshi's a green guy with a big tongue.

27
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:41,690
Rym: Oh, it's so much cooler than that.

28
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:47,230
Rym: So toshi yoshi is Actually the name of what?

29
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:55,010
Rym: Yagu, toshi oshi was the founder of the Oari branch of the yagu shin kage ryu sword style in the early edo period.

30
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,572
Scott: All right.

31
00:01:55,812 --> 00:02:00,488
Rym: He was one of those grandmasters who was around at the same time of another famous Japanese swordsman.

32
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:04,150
Scott: Yeah Musashi, they're gonna say yeah you juvie.

33
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:17,516
Rym: So according to legend Musashi Miyamoto was in Nagoya and noticed a man Carrying himself in a way that befitted a great warrior and he asked this man without prompting Aren't you Lord?

34
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:23,198
Rym: Yagu toshi oshi to which he replied I am aren't you Lord Miyamoto?

35
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:31,290
Rym: Musashi to which he replied I am and Apparently they'd never met each other and they bonded through the fact that they were so badass.

36
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:42,397
Scott: And that is the story that I have no citation for whatsoever Sounds like a made-up story, but it reminds me of that part in Fullmetal Alchemist where they They bonded through their muscles.

37
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:44,386
Rym: That was one of the best scenes in Fullmetal Alchemist.

38
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:45,290
Scott: That was a good part right there.

39
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,177
Scott: I have to say I think it's in the manga too.

40
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:50,630
Rym: So I feel like I should start going by toshi yoshi.

41
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,014
Scott: How about not?

42
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:55,064
Rym: toshi yoshi don't know if you try that shit.

43
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,308
Scott: Everyone's gonna call you Brandon.

44
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:56,750
Scott: I think that's.

45
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:04,608
Rym: It's weird how no one calls me Brandon except my like business contacts that are completely separated from my real life.

46
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:06,513
Rym: Yeah And Tex.

47
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:07,578
Scott: Uh-huh.

48
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:08,140
Scott: That's right.

49
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,860
Rym: I always found it funny that someone who was called Tex Decided not to call me by my name.

50
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,200
Rym: I think it isn't his name Tex I don't even you know.

51
00:03:16,623 --> 00:03:21,225
Rym: in all these years I never asked him if that was a nickname or if that was a real name.

52
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,389
Rym: I've never seen his ID.

53
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,815
Scott: Maybe that's his strategy.

54
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:27,770
Scott: is that he's like if I'm the only one who can have a weird name, then I'll be the king.

55
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,622
Rym: All right, lads from now on you're all calling me.

56
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:31,386
Scott: That's it.

57
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,849
Scott: That's his rejoicing advantage.

58
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,578
Rym: Well, well there are other.

59
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:40,201
Rym: I mean Nuri's name is not Nuri, but that does.

60
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:41,790
Rym: no one calls her anything but nerd.

61
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,347
Rym: I don't think half the people in the crew even know her real name, which I think is hilarious.

62
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:49,677
Rym: I know sadly even worse Your mom in the forums.

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,257
Rym: I'm not gonna reveal her secret identity, but Mrs.

64
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:07,250
Rym: DeCoster Well the royal your mom Okay, but I knew her from an internet name and as an internet friend at conventions before I knew her real name.

65
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:15,600
Rym: So for a long time after we became friends, I called her by her internet name in person Her non your mom internet name.

66
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:15,881
Scott: Yes.

67
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:17,688
Rym: Your mom is a much better internet name.

68
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:25,410
Rym: I agree That's like the best because it it allowed for the most epic punning of anyone on the internet ever as far as I'm concerned.

69
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,795
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

70
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,997
Rym: So, uh, that's all I got.

71
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:31,381
Rym: that's my it's my morning.

72
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,970
Scott: so tonight we're gonna order some pizza action after the show.

73
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,436
Rym: So what kind of pizza we gonna get?

74
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:38,047
Scott: I suggest some variety of meat.

75
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,517
Rym: I don't know I'm kind of going for a Margarita.

76
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:43,549
Scott: Yeah, I want sauce and cheese.

77
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:44,914
Rym: What kind of sauce I like?

78
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:45,496
Rym: I see.

79
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:48,807
Rym: the one problem I have is you don't like the pesto pizza.

80
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:49,770
Scott: No, not really.

81
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:57,165
Scott: I really like the pesto pizza white pizza a red sauce Actually some sort of cheese the best and some sort of meat and or vegetables.

82
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:58,490
Rym: the best pizza is not olive.

83
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,078
Rym: We have to do a show on pizza.

84
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,050
Scott: Well, it's a good Thursday easy Thursday You know, we need to get like an expert pizza person to talk to you on the Thursday.

85
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:06,925
Rym: Oh, yes, we do.

86
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:09,630
Rym: Maybe we get the guy down the street who runs that pizza.

87
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:17,039
Rym: She want to get in to come to our house like hey come to our house and be on a radio show about pizza Because he makes that cornmeal crust and it's so good.

88
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:18,203
Scott: Yeah, I'd rather get.

89
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:25,269
Scott: I'd rather get like some ancient Italian dude Though who can barely speak English, that'd be much better All right.

90
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,098
Scott: Yeah needs to be crusty.

91
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,210
Rym: that is what Italian people sound like old ones.

92
00:05:40,172 --> 00:05:41,556
Rym: So Scott don't know.

93
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:43,040
Rym: what do you got in the sky?

94
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,521
Scott: don't know?

95
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:44,805
Rym: I just don't know.

96
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:45,487
Scott: I'm not Scott.

97
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:51,149
Rym: Coon is my is my favorite like of all the honorifics.

98
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,716
Scott: I Because for being silly.

99
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:56,444
Scott: now, you have to call me Scott son Scott son.

100
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:57,045
Scott: It's right.

101
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:57,386
Rym: I don't know.

102
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:58,288
Rym: I think Coon works.

103
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:02,278
Scott: No All right, and then your Rym John.

104

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,423
Rym: John wrote about Rym time.

106
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:06,268
Rym: No, I prefer a Rym don't know?

107
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:07,050
Rym: that's tough.

108
00:06:07,972 --> 00:06:11,162
Rym: So what do you have in the stupid anime news captain anime?

109
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:12,225
Scott: Oh, I forgot.

110
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,508
Scott: What was my anime news?

111
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:13,889
Scott: All right.

112
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:16,360
Scott: So check this out.

113
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,470
Scott: Remember that whole.

114
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:18,614
Scott: This is.

115
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:26,029
Scott: this is not really an anime news the copyright news but there are all sorts of anime peoples getting up in arms about it because they're stupid right.

116
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:31,350
Scott: and Finally, there's like a definitive word on it that I can trust so I could bring it up again.

117
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,076
Scott: Remember that orphaned works action.

118
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:37,350
Rym: I remember that in like 1995 when it was on the internet, right?

119
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:43,610
Scott: Well, basically there's been recent uproar about the orphaned works action and there was a big uproar and then it went down a bit.

120
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,817
Scott: But now it's rumbling again.

121
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:49,981
Scott: I'm a rabble rabble rabble rabble You know, everyone was sort of one, you know, there are a lot of.

122
00:06:50,021 --> 00:07:03,745
Scott: there was a lot of FUD going around about it you know and I was sort of like I was taking the stance that hey is a good thing because You know there's a lot of works out there that no one know even knows who owns these things.

123
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:18,006
Scott: people who own them don't even know they Own them and they're not entering the public domain, you know, it's not really it's not good right and that there's all you know, basically you can't create anything because You don't know if you're infringing on something or not, you know, it's like

124
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:18,970
Rym: even with video games.

125
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:34,200
Rym: We have a lot of ideas about taking old Awesome, but forgotten video games and porting them to something or making a pair something fun with them but a lot of times and I actually tried to track down the copyrights of a few old games and I Couldn't find Jack,

126
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:34,684
Scott: right?

127
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:41,250
Scott: So You know, I was saying it was good and then all these artists were like saying no, it's bad people take all our shit.

128
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,970
Scott: Well the Larry Lessig if you don't know Larry Lessig is I don't know.

129
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,381
Scott: I've mentioned him a lot of times on the show Mostly on Monday mostly on Monday and Thursday.

130
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:59,530
Scott: Lawrence Lessig is like an ultra famous Super lawyer and he was until recently like a copyright guy and that was his focus like the Creative Commons stuff.

131
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:01,449
Scott: That's all because of him pretty much.

132
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,730
Scott: I mean there were other people too, but that that's his business right there and there's a Ted video.

133
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:09,049
Scott: You can see him talk and basically you'll understand his whole deal from that.

134
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:23,705
Scott: But He recently, you know sort of quit the copyright business of lawyering because he realized or he sort of came to the conclusion That he couldn't fix the copyright business if he couldn't fix the corruption in government.

135
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:25,650
Scott: So now he's working on fixing corruption instead.

136
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:28,722
Rym: I'm curious what will come out of that man.

137
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:30,170
Scott: I'm very curious what will come out of it.

138
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,009
Scott: He's a very smart man, but that's a very impossible problem.

139
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:34,605
Scott: So what will be?

140
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:39,495
Scott: Regardless of that he takes like one month a year off I think the month of May.

141
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:45,285
Scott: so he wasn't around this month But despite that there was.

142
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:58,519
Scott: in the New York Times There was an article by Lawrence Lessig a very short one, you know It's only like a little bit and where he talks about the recent orphaned works bill stuff Right, and he agrees with me in that.

143
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,161
Scott: Yes.

144
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:00,585
Scott: We got to get these orphaned works.

145
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,809
Scott: So people can fucking use them.

146
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:02,270
Scott: Good God.

147
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:11,446
Scott: but He actually disagrees with the specific bill that's going on and after reading it I it's hard not to completely agree with them.

148
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:14,596
Scott: pretty much What he points out is the way the bill works.

149
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:22,421
Scott: now though as written is let's say Rym made a song and like 1983 when he's one year old.

150
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:22,985
Rym: All right.

151
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:23,489
Rym: All right.

152
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,785
Scott: Okay, the song is by default copyrighted to you, right and that's sort of been the way.

153
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:30,731
Scott: that's the way it's been for a long Time.

154
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:36,029
Scott: so people are used to this automatic copyright business, right now Let's say I wanted to use that song.

155
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:43,792
Scott: all that is required of me to avoid getting sued is I have to do due diligence in order to make sure that no one Owns that.

156
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:46,847
Scott: no one is, you know, maintaining this copyright and then I can use it.

157
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:54,590
Scott: So basically what happens is, you know with that situation, you know, I'm sure they haven't like, you know explicitly define the due diligence yet.

158
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:01,357
Scott: But someone goes like a library, you know or and you know pay someone or you know Does the due diligence they all?

159
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:04,070
Scott: I didn't find anything and then they start using it, right?

160
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,930
Scott: And then later on someone comes along as I say you did due diligence, but you still didn't find me here.

161
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,170
Rym: I am what the fuck well then that I would argue that that simply wasn't due diligence.

162
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:15,070
Scott: Well, I know but you know.

163
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,924
Scott: The question is is you know, is there a better way than this due diligence thing?

164
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:25,650
Scott: because and also, you know They haven't strictly defined what the due diligence is And he has a better solution anyway.

165
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,190
Scott: So it doesn't really matter if you know what if the depth how good the definition due diligence is.

166
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:35,510
Scott: His better solution is you get your copyright for an amount of time, right?

167
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:42,712
Scott: And then if you want to keep it longer, all you have to do is file a form and pay $1.

168
00:10:42,712 --> 00:10:49,389
Rym: Actually that has been the the good idea that's been passed around for the last like 20 years in regards to copyright.

169
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:52,324
Scott: that way I know but it's like that way right.

170
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:55,337
Scott: if something is orphaned It's basically you just look up.

171
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:56,501
Scott: did anyone pay the dollar?

172
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:59,070
Scott: no, okay that the deal is really easy.

173
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,456
Scott: Did anyone pay their dollar?

174
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:01,038
Scott: Right?

175
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:01,762
Scott: Is it this old?

176
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:02,545
Scott: Did anyone pay a dollar?

177
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:03,549
Scott: very easy to figure out?

178
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:05,872
Rym: There's some.

179
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:07,218
Rym: I mean, how long is the period?

180
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:07,981
Rym: because what if I?

181
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,512
Scott: well he's he said 14 years, but whatever All right.

182
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:16,760
Rym: So 14 years, let's say I take a thousand pictures Alright, and I want to keep the copyright on all the things.

183
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,582
Rym: I'm using them for stuff.

184
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:18,365
Scott: Yep.

185
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:20,232
Rym: I gotta pay $1,000.

186
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:21,283
Scott: Yep, that's great.

187
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:21,890
Scott: That is great.

188
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,137
Rym: Yeah It's actually not that bad cuz one dollar.

189
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:28,395
Rym: really we can even make it because what it does is you should be could make it Just ten cents.

190
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:29,079
Rym: Basically.

191
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,668
Rym: All you have to do is set up the effort.

192
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,716
Scott: Of course I think the reason a dollar is good.

193
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,890
Scott: is that sure it might add up if you have a lot of works, right?

194
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:45,790
Scott: But any of the works that aren't actually producing money for you You're not gonna bother to pay the dollar and thus it's better for the public because we're gonna get all these.

195
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:49,378
Scott: You know things that aren't you know, you know They're not valuable to.

196
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,290
Rym: you get all the kind of second-tier work, right?

197
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,128
Scott: Right the stuff that no one could you know thinks they can make money off of.

198
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,580
Rym: But that is the point that people are gonna go crazy about.

199
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,950
Rym: that is but those are the people who have no money.

200
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:10,095
Rym: You're a flicker full of you know 10,000 pictures all marked with the most limited license they can put on there and then they want to keep their copyright for as long As they live plus a million years.

201
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:13,630
Scott: Yeah, even though they're not making any money off of those things, right?

202
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,209
Scott: It's like you're not making many off of it.

203
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:18,268
Scott: You released it and you know you released it to where people can look at it.

204
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:22,208
Scott: Hey now you sort of want to keep people from making remixes of it.

205
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:28,690
Rym: Yeah Cuz think if you did like no didn't release it anywhere to the public then no one can get it to infringe on your thing.

206
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:29,881
Rym: You don't pay the dollar.

207
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:30,486
Scott: I know right.

208
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,450
Scott: The other thing he points out is that he makes some exceptions.

209
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,890
Scott: He's like foreign country people like in foreign countries like shouldn't have to pay the dollar.

210
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:45,760
Scott: They should have different rules because how are they supposed to know that they have to fill out a form and pay a dollar in The US, you know, it's it's sort of stuff like that.

211
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,382
Scott: He points out.

212
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:48,946
Scott: There's a couple other exceptions He throws in there, too.

213
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:57,200
Scott: but I think you should if you're one of those people who is believing the FUD or Confused about the FUD surrounding the orphan works thing.

214
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,809
Scott: You should read this New York Times article from the smart guy.

215
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:05,311
Rym: So in some more directly anime related news hal Cali a Japanese band That's.

216
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:10,710
Rym: they look pretty awesome and they're going to be performing at Japan Day in New York City.

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,750
Scott: Well, they already performed at anime central last week.

218
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,190
Rym: Right and I hear from what I read because I was kind of looking up on them for reasons That will be apparent in a minute.

00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:23,649
Rym: The concert went really well and they're gonna be in New York performing at the second annual Japan Day event on June 1st.

Scott: so nice Central Park music is usually free.

235
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,537
Rym: Well, I'll be honest in general when it comes to anime events I don't even think about the price cuz.

236
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:11,704
Rym: where's the last time we paid for a convention?

237
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:12,486
Scott: I don't know.

238
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:13,610
Rym: but anyway.

239
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,950
Rym: So June 1st concert that's gonna be pretty cool.

240
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:30,490

244
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:57,870
Scott: Yeah, you might have to get there pretty damn early But I feel really bad that I've never listened these people music, but I promise I will get mp3s right after the show.

245
00:14:58,253 --> 00:14:59,161
Rym: Yeah, we'll be all set.

246
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,149

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,955
Scott: I really hope it goes well.

251
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:20,045
Scott: cuz like the second shot, you know, it's like the first shot was easy as TMR I was like a shoo-in, you know, the second one is sort of like.

252
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:21,030
Scott: well, let's see how it goes.

253
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,004
Scott: And I think if it goes I think it's really it's gonna be a successful monthly deal.

254
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:29,430
Rym: that that would be way cool Yes, and also there's a website about a link to it.

255
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:36,275
Rym: But if these events start taking off you can go to a samurai beat radio calm and they'll be kind of regular listings of all These things.

256
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,670
Scott: Oh nice to get a website going.

257
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:44,854
Rym: Well, they actually asked us to send pictures of ourselves to which we realize that Scott doesn't have any Presentable pictures of himself.

258
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:45,958
Scott: Yeah, I'm a presenter.

259
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:46,721
Scott: most of the pictures.

260
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:52,178
Rym: I'm in like you're like it's like a wide shot Or you're flipping me off.

261
00:15:52,439 --> 00:16:06,033
Scott: the best picture of myself is a picture We took two katsu kansa go and it was like me you In like Conrad and you go behind the table and I'm like off to the side wearing like my Metroid shirt Just like hey Don't you hate that?

262
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:11,895
Rym: when like you find the one good picture you and I'm off to the side and I'm kind of small and you Can't recreate that moment.

263
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:13,320
Rym: And if you zoom in it's too grainy.

264
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:13,781
Scott: Yeah.

265
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:21,090
Rym: Well, the only picture of me I have this presentable is Probably not suitable for being used in a press capacity.

266
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:22,912
Rym: Great.

267
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:30,477
Rym: Yeah, it's in my flicker and I'm kind of horrified that I was going through my flicker looking for pictures of myself And I forgot that I put those pictures up.

268
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:37,542
Rym: and I was even more horrified that I don't enough Apparently found these pictures and both left comments.

269
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:39,470
Scott: I gotta go take this out.

270
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,099
Rym: Things of the day.

271
00:16:49,641 --> 00:17:01,020
Rym: so I came across this and the main reason this is my thing of the day is because the song is Really really really catchy like it just got stuck in my head for the last week.

272
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:13,569
Rym: It's kind of bad and you hear it and you go ah, ah, it's in my head And actually for a while like Emily was here and Scott was here and we're trying to figure out cuz it sounded really familiar We couldn't figure out what it was from right away.

273
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,336
Rym: We're like, ah, I know this song.

274
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,419
Rym: I've heard this song.

275
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:18,005
Rym: Ah, did you hate it when that happens?

276
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:19,349
Scott: Yeah, it's it's pretty rough.

277
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,076
Scott: Then you hear a song.

278
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,180
Scott: I heard this song.

279
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,746
Scott: I've heard this song before.

280
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,071
Scott: I don't know the name of it.

281
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:26,035
Scott: I don't know who sings it.

282
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:26,999
Scott: I don't know where it's from.

283
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,886
Rym: But this song this video for one is pretty well done.

284
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,989
Rym: I mean the animation quality.

285
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:40,916
Scott: it's 3d is Actually really really natural and surprised standing far away from it and I'm like I can make that.

286
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,240
Scott: and Emily's like no you can't.

287
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,520
Scott: And I'm like, yeah, I could I just need a little puppets and she's like, it's not puppets at CG.

288
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,685
Scott: I'm like, oh I can't make that.

289
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:50,720
Rym: you couldn't do that with puppets if I had the puppets already.

290
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:54,140
Scott: They don't move very much, but their faces change constantly.

291
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:57,836
Scott: If you've changed the face on a puppet all you do is you know, you take the eyes off you.

292
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,221
Scott: it's like it's like mr Potato head.

293
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:01,791
Rym: and how do you do that without moving it mr.

294
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,157
Rym: Potato head and mr.

295
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:03,920
Rym: Potato head moves.

296
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:06,893
Scott: The puppets are really big and you but the cameras really far away.

297
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:07,757
Scott: That's why they look.

298
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:10,768
Rym: Yeah Yeah, but the thing is it's very like.

299
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:11,931
Rym: I guess the mood it's.

300
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,560
Rym: the movement was more natural than that Final Fantasy movie.

301
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,700
Scott: Yeah, I never actually saw that Final Fantasy movie.

302
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,672
Scott: I just knew of it like it's it's.

303
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:23,160
Rym: the animation is really good Even though like the characters seem like they don't move a lot.

304
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,949
Rym: You might say oh, why would you say it's so good.

305
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,960
Rym: It's so like stilted and blah.

306
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:35,760
Rym: Well, the second link in my thing of the day is the kind of source to this video Which will let you kind of understand where this came from.

307
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,988
Rym: You see there are two things at play here.

308
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,590
Rym: one.

309
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,206
Rym: The song is from sergeant frog One of the closers.

310
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:50,089
Rym: cuz sergeant frog closers have like dances in them and the characters are just doing the dance From that closer to sergeant frog.

311
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:57,056
Rym: Mm-hmm very well, but in addition to that The song itself is not the original song from that closer.

312
00:18:57,698 --> 00:18:58,240
Rym: It's a remix.

313
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:03,820
Rym: It's a special remix because the voice that is singing is not actually a human being or anything.

314
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:06,069
Rym: It's that vocaloid program.

315
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:18,240
Rym: now if you don't know what vocaloid is It's basically a program where you can type in Lyrics and then assign notes to the lyrics and do other stuff and a fake idol will sing your song.

316
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,205
Rym: Surprisingly well for you.

317
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:26,160
Scott: a fake like, you know singing pop star idol not a fake, you know tiki idol.

318
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:30,655
Rym: I don't know if I need to specify on a Wednesday night.

319
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:31,017
Scott: Yeah.

320
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:31,499
Scott: Yes you do.

321
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:33,219
Rym: How many?

322
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,272
Rym: anyway So the animations catchy.

323
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:39,705
Rym: the song is catchy I point out.

324
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:43,160
Rym: watch the girl in the upper left because she totally doesn't know the day.

325
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,828
Scott: Yeah, I think that's that's my favorite part.

326
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,591
Rym: I don't know.

327
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:47,440
Rym: I like the girl in the upper right with her yelling.

328
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:48,364
Scott: No, I like that.

329
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,409
Scott: I like the can't dance one.

330
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:50,192
Rym: It's just.

331
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:50,815
Rym: it's really good.

332
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:51,337
Rym: Check it out.

333
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:51,920
Scott: It's cute stuff.

334
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:56,113
Rym: It's also I point out not just ripped out of dig or college humor.

335
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:58,120
Scott: Yeah, so check this out already.

336
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,726
Scott: This is totally ripped out of.

337
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:03,019
Scott: uh, I forget where but it doesn't matter.

338
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:08,586
Scott: Take your Lupin the third TV series opening animation.

339
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:12,579
Scott: replace the Lupin gang with Metal Gear.

340
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:15,099
Scott: That is my thing of the day.

341
00:20:16,024 --> 00:20:19,057
Scott: You probably saw this on the Internet's maybe already maybe not.

342
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,363
Scott: it doesn't matter Really?

343
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:35,379
Scott: Like I can tell that this is really funny and some of it is funny But because I don't really know Metal Gear was so well I don't get some of the jokes, but yeah, if you know Lupin and you know Metal Gear It's obvious that this is probably gonna crack you up.

344
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:46,557
Rym: We're definitely well, we might get a little bit of hate for this but I remember when I played Metal Gear Solid 1 and I didn't really like it that much and it was an okay game from what I played.

345
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:47,200
Scott: I didn't play enough.

346
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:49,728
Scott: I mean, I should seek out the GameCube version.

347
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,290
Scott: Oh, yeah.

348
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:59,162
Rym: Yeah, but I feel as though I don't know If this might be one of those things were just mark sauce as from the previous generation of gaming much like the most recent VgCads.

349
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:00,807
Scott: you like right you like Metal Gear 1.

350
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:03,053
Rym: Yeah, like Metal Gear 1 is my favorite metal.

351
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:03,414
Scott: Metal Gear 2.

352
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:08,189
Rym: Oh my god Wait, wait, there was no Metal Gear 2.

353
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:09,072
Scott: Oh, you're sorry.

354
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:10,437
Rym: I have no son.

355
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:11,200
Rym: That's right.

356
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:14,260
Scott: How could I imagine such a fake thing?

357
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,656
Rym: So I used the game genie to cheat at Metal Gear 2. cuz fuck that game.

358
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:20,639
Scott: I thought it didn't exist.

359
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:27,339
Rym: Well, I stopped playing with my mind and some game right this game and I cheated at it.

360
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:37,247
Rym: And then I realized that I couldn't save my game because I couldn't die because the cheat code I used and And I'd already gone on halfway through.

361
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:38,954
Rym: that game is impossible and stupid.

362
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:40,340
Rym: That's like, oh my god.

363
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,166
Rym: So it doesn't matter.

364
00:21:41,186 --> 00:21:41,570
Rym: That's right.

365
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:44,966
Scott: Red just made that whole thing up.

366
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:53,060
Scott: Yeah, but Metal Gear 1 is our business, you know That game is nothing but a pack of cigarettes and a fist and a fist.

367
00:21:53,463 --> 00:22:06,035
Rym: I love how later in the game you get that Trunch Dogs You get that transmitter like you get you get captured and then you get let go and you got this extra item now called Transmitter and I remember I got it and I was like, oh, what's that?

368
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:07,420
Rym:  and I used it and it disappeared.

369
00:22:07,821 --> 00:22:13,240
Rym: And I was like, oh no, no, I gotta save it for whatever I use it for because it's obviously awesome.

370
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,957
Rym: so I You know started again got to that point made sure I didn't use it trying to think about what it would do or when I was gonna use it.

371
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:28,100
Rym: and for the rest of the game Every screen I went to the bad guys knew how it was there.

372
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,020
Rym: They tried to kill me because you see the transmitter was a bug placed there by the bad guys.

373
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:37,711
Rym: You were supposed to use it as in you discover and destroy it But I was too clever.

374
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,688
Rym: I kept it For the whole rest of the game.

375
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:48,380
Rym: I kept it and then my friend Joe said He basically told me in no uncertain terms that I was an idiot.

376
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:51,967
Rym: That was the first I realized.

377
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:54,174
Scott: thus is the way of the NES game.

378
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:55,860
Rym: Oh man, remember those mazes?

379
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:58,576
Scott: Yeah, which truck do I get on?

380
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:00,858
Rym: All the time to move?

381
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:07,820
Rym: Yeah Okay, we got to do a show on Metal Gear one, I didn't play it enough really.

382
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,765
Rym: Yeah, I can beat that game pretty quick.

383
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,032
Scott: I've only played like maybe 20 screens of it.

384
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:14,520
Rym: Yeah, that's that's actually kind of far.

385
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:15,468
Scott: It's pretty far.

386
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,659
Rym: No, it's not at all.

387
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:19,355
Rym: That barely gets you into the first building.

388
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:19,859
Scott: I know.

389
00:23:20,562 --> 00:23:29,579
Rym: Anyway, so we were thinking about reviewing Kazu no yo Jimbo tonight, which is kind of an older anime and it's not that old I mean, it's it's this millennium anime.

390
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:32,126
Rym: Well, no it isn't.

391
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:33,471
Scott: yeah, what year is it from?

392
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:38,308
Rym: I might have maybe I think might have come out like 2001 I don't remember but this millennium anime.

393
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:41,099
Rym: Yeah, whatever that's still seven years ago.

394
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:43,519
Scott: It came out when we were at an RIT.

395
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,160
Rym: It must have been 2002 at least I'm guessing but it was in the early days before I was a run in the anime club.

396
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,500
Scott: I'm pretty sure anyway, cuz I remember I only watched one disc of it and you have the second one.

397
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,540
Scott: So we're thinking we'll watch the second disc before we review the show.

398
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,820
Rym: We got to give it at least a fair shake and I'm not sure if I'm gonna watch the rest.

399
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,660
Scott: It's sort of a an ambiguous kind of show and it's I can't really tell if it's good or bad.

400
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:06,618
Scott: So I need to watch some more.

401
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:15,780
Rym: But as a result instead of reviewing something we're gonna you know Do the classic cop-out and have a have a topic in anime manga or comics.

402
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:21,560
Scott: It's a little bit of a cop-out show because it's similar to a show we've done before but it'll also be kind of short.

403
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,006
Rym: Hardly because it's late and I'm tired But it really a bunch of pizza.

404
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,475
Scott: the episode also sort of has an agenda.

405
00:24:28,536 --> 00:24:34,473
Scott: in that we've realized People really don't seem to understand what we have to talk about.

406
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:35,255
Rym: So here's the deal.

407
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:45,150
Rym: every time someone on the internet asks the question, you know, I Keep hearing about this anime thing, but I don't know much about it.

408
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:46,875
Rym: Maybe I could get into it.

409
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:50,659
Rym: What show Should I watch?

410
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:55,080
Scott: Well, the thing is we did an episode on how to get into anime.

411
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:56,780
Scott: So if you're asking that question.

412
00:24:57,221 --> 00:25:02,097
Scott: You can go and listen to that episode that I guess it's an older episode of ours and it'll answer the question.

413
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:06,332
Rym: the short answer However is watch the first DVD of cowboy bebop.

414
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:10,920
Rym: if that doesn't do it for you watch Anything directed by a man named Satoshi?

415
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:17,590
Scott: Yeah, but despite us doing that episode, you know You think that episode would also right.

416
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:26,780
Scott: if someone wanted to get their friend into anime They would just sort of interpret the instructions of how to get yourself into anime and transfer them to the friend.

417
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:29,800
Rym: It asked watch cowboy bebop.

418
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:46,840
Scott: Yes But apparently people don't seem to understand this and a lot of people on the internet when confronted, you know Anime fans when confronted with someone who is not an anime fan asking about anime Will tell them all sorts of stupid shit that makes them not anime fans.

419
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:49,460
Rym: It seems like there's a bunch of different classes of these people.

420
00:25:50,708 --> 00:26:00,080
Rym: There's the Old-school anime fan or the or the other way to put it is the anime fan who's otaku wang is bigger than your otaku wang.

421
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,048
Rym: Yeah, and what he'll do is he'll name drop.

422
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:16,980
Rym: He will say he'll always name either Shows that are not necessarily that great or weren't that well received but have a cult following Mostly from the late 80s early 90s or they'll name shows that there's no way you've seen them.

423
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,920
Rym: They've never been released in English anywhere.

424
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:23,600
Scott: Well, I think with those people actually tend to do is they tend to be the older school fan, right?

425
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,653
Scott: So they'll tell you to watch the show that they started on cuz like.

426
00:26:27,693 --> 00:26:29,660
Scott: well this show got me interested in anime.

427
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,804
Scott: So look at you and just anime.

428
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:34,719
Scott: so they always give you like a star blazers or a macross or something like that.

429
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:41,120
Rym: But I think a lot of those people also Just they get I think they like the idea of giving the off answer.

430
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:51,333
Rym: Like if you go into a thread where someone asked hey I don't get an anime and someone says watch cowboy bebop eska flown a Evangelion try gun the Akira movie, you know, they the same list Miyazaki's.

431
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:53,460
Rym: and so she can yes, that's pretty much it.

432
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,423
Scott: That's pretty much it right there.

433
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:59,500
Rym: They always want to say something but someone else already said cowboy bebop at all.

434
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,569
Rym: Yeah, so what they do is they think what.

435
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:03,171
Rym: what can I say?

436
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:04,355
Rym: That'll make me sound cool.

437
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,105
Rym: Oh, yeah, Macross Do you remember love?

438
00:27:07,346 --> 00:27:08,350
Rym: and while that's a good movie?

439
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,797
Rym: I don't know if that's quite forward.

440
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:10,580
Rym: I guess an anime new.

441
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:11,865
Scott: Actually, you know a lot.

442
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:14,897
Scott: this is a side note, but a lot of those fanboys are all about.

443
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:15,620
Scott: do you remember love?

444
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:16,684
Scott: I don't like.

445
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:20,000
Scott: I think the TV series is what you should watch and screw the compilation movie.

446
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,362
Rym: I don't know.

447
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:22,013
Rym: the compilation movie does its job.

448
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:24,867
Rym: Yeah, I guess It's not anyway, it's not like.

449
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:25,953
Rym: it's a bad movie.

450
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:26,314
Rym: I don't.

451
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:32,292
Rym: Hey, whatever You're just you wanted to generate some hate mail.

452
00:27:32,312 --> 00:27:34,080
Rym: That's the only reason you said that you're home.

453
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,465
Scott: I've said it before hoping.

454
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:37,855
Rym: I've said before you said that is you're over.

455
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:39,180
Rym: the Darryl Surratt is sitting there.

456
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:44,940
Rym: I've told them before I know and he's sitting there right now going damn it Scott you said that again.

457
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:50,155
Rym: Yeah I will see here in furious silence and then I'll watch this.

458
00:27:50,195 --> 00:27:55,300
Rym: to the North Star episode 78 Where I don't know if no one has some guy gets a head exploded.

459
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:57,270
Scott: I so the other thing.

460
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,304
Scott: a lot of people mistake when you know They'll be an anime fan.

461
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:04,640
Scott: their friend who is not an anime fan will say hey, I'm interested in maybe trying some anime.

462
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,343
Scott: What should I watch?

463
00:28:05,866 --> 00:28:09,080
Scott: that they'll tell their friend their personal favorite?

464
00:28:09,341 --> 00:28:13,560
Scott: Right, you don't tell someone else right your favorite anime.

465
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:14,587
Rym: I mean, it's hard.

466
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:20,520
Scott: if your favorite anime is cowboy bebop Then I guess you don't hear him telling people to start watching at Utena if they're not into anime.

467
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,211
Rym: Yes, if someone has never heard of anime and they're asking me for suggestions.

468
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:27,200
Rym: I do not say shoujo kakume Utena.

469
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,383
Scott: No, that's rims favorite show.

470
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:33,280
Rym: Well, it's as my love that show, but I think it's a tie between that and captain Tyler.

471
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:35,313
Scott: Well, even so you don't tell people to watch either.

472
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:37,589
Scott: one of those is the first show I barely tell anyone to watch.

473
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:41,755
Rym: captain Tyler cuz while I love it You really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy captain Tyler.

474
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:45,688
Scott: Yeah The earlier episodes work in an anime club.

475
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:48,295
Scott: They hope the rest of the episodes don't work.

476
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:50,060
Scott: So well, that's the right circumstances.

477
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:51,803
Rym: They're kind of it's.

478
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:52,988
Rym: there's their shows.

479
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:53,992
Rym: that and not just that.

480
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:54,635
Rym: but there's a lot like.

481
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:55,960
Rym: Excel saga is a good example.

482
00:28:56,542 --> 00:29:03,252
Rym: I think it's a great show because when it came out like it the parody level was a Thousand times more parody than any anime I'd ever seen.

483
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:17,840
Rym: that was parodying other anime yep, and it was hilarious and wacky and here's a zany kind of humor, but It's a show that if you've never seen anime it is not only incomprehensible But possibly stupid and frightening.

484
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:18,300
Rym: Yeah

485
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:31,820
Scott: I mean if you were to make a list of Like, you know if you're to rank every anime in the universe in order from you know Number one is the best possible show for a new fan and like number a billion is the worst possible show for a new fan.

486
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:44,159
Scott: Excel saga would probably be the very last show on the list except for all the hentai has to just come after it And I guess the way I would say it is it's a show for the advanced anime watcher.

487
00:29:44,622 --> 00:29:44,983
Scott: Yeah, it's.

488
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:48,180
Scott: it's not the show you start out with or at least the experienced anime watcher.

489
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:59,065
Rym: I mean There's some shows that just they jump right into something that if you're not kind of already familiar with the tropes or the mores or They like the character arch types Lucky stars and the Haru.

490
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:03,780
Scott: He's are not gonna work on someone who is a brand new to anime and hasn't watched a bunch already.

491
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:05,139
Scott: So it's just not gonna happen.

492
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,948
Rym: I guess the point there is what you really have to do if you want if someone else if you want them Who then they don't watch anime?

493
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:12,799
Rym: to watch anime you want to spread your fandom?

494
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,683
Rym: Remove yourself from the equation and think about things in terms of well There's two ways to look at it.

495
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:23,859
Rym: one is what are the majority of people like like what are the most?

496
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,569
Rym: Popular across the broadest spectrum of people.

497
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:33,187
Rym: and that second part is key because while like bleach is crazy Crazy popular.

498
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:41,978
Rym: It's crazy crazy popular among Certain specific groups of people and it's generally maligned or not enjoyed by most other groups of people.

499
00:30:42,219 --> 00:30:49,220
Scott: Yep But something like spirited away is enjoyed by almost everybody except Kalani except one guy.

500
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:57,838
Scott: But I mean that is that is you know It's something just pretty much almost any human being of any age and demographic can find some joy in somewhere.

501
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:00,141
Scott: almost It was like 99%.

502
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:06,560
Scott: So if a random person comes up to you and says I want to get into anime Saying spirited away is something you should watch is not a bad answer.

503
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:15,214
Scott: in fact I would always suggest using movies as opposed to TV shows as actions to anime because someone can get the whole thing in one shot.

504
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:19,840
Scott: getting someone to watch a 26 episode TV series is much more difficult.

505
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:23,753
Scott: Even a 13 episode is much more than even a 4 episode OAV.

506
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:27,125
Scott: much more difficult than a movie Which is one and done.

507
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:33,749
Rym: to get someone into anime at IBM once I had to Basically beat them over the head.

508
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:41,980
Rym: I gave him cowboy bebop and they were like Five episodes and I was like, alright look just watch the fifth one.

509
00:31:42,582 --> 00:31:45,771
Rym: If you like that watch the first one.

510
00:31:46,393 --> 00:31:50,887
Rym: if you like that watch the rest and Finally watch the fifth episode.

511
00:31:50,947 --> 00:31:54,399
Rym: He was like, I'd never seen a cartoon where someone pulled a gun before.

512
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:01,538
Rym: But sadly that's often the kind of angle you have to go at least with people who aren't.

513
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,623
Rym: I mean There are people who just they know about anime They just don't watch it.

514
00:32:05,004 --> 00:32:10,560
Rym: and then there are people who just are unaware of the idea that animation is not a genre.

515
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:13,376
Rym: That means shows for people under the age of two.

516
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:19,869
Rym: Yeah so what you want to do is Empathize with the person figure out.

517
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,438
Rym: All right, what do they like?

518
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:21,760
Rym: ask them?

519
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,098
Rym: What shows they like what movies they like if they like?

520
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,273
Rym: Alfred Hitchcock like thrillers and they like every Alfred Hitchcock movie and that kind of thing.

521
00:32:29,835 --> 00:32:42,251
Rym: or like the old like Dean Coons books or any like sort of psychological thriller then give them a copy of perfect blue because it's just a thriller a Psychological thriller that happens to be animated.

522
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:48,274
Scott: Yeah, if they're liking, you know Westerns and stuff then give them you know, the old try gun.

523
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:52,129
Rym: if they're liking well Well, it depends because try gun starts out a little.

524
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:53,615
Rym: I had to convince my dad.

525
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:58,350
Rym: I was like dad seriously, trust me It's not that guy running around with donuts or whatever.

526
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:05,253
Scott: No if they like, you know, like fantasy action You can maybe give them some slayers or some other, you know, you got.

527
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:07,200
Rym: well again, that's one of those.

528
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,584
Rym: What kind of fantasy do they like?

529
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:09,327
Rym: are they?

530
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:13,340
Rym: if they're busy if they're a D&D playing beer and pretzels?

531
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,049
Rym: Let's go kill the dragons.

532
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:24,300
Rym: They'll probably find slayers Hilarious probably if they're a. I'm a serious business dungeon master and I play serious business dungeons and dragons.

533
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:27,572
Rym: The original lotus war is gonna kick their ass.

534
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:27,954
Rym: They will.

535
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:28,777
Rym: they will love that.

536
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:32,580
Rym: they'll eat that up Yeah, so it's like then they'll murder you when they find out where it goes.

537
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:36,180
Scott: Yeah, it's like if you don't know the person you got to go the general route.

538
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,212
Scott: You know stuff that almost anyone will like.

539
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:44,500
Scott: but if you do know the person Then or if you add you can always question them out - you say what do you like, you know?

540
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,970
Scott: What kind of like, you know, what's your favorite movie?

541
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:49,220
Scott: if they say, you know Blade Runner?

542
00:33:49,780 --> 00:34:00,578
Scott: Maybe you could give them some Akira's or something or maybe some ghost in the shell action Yeah, or if they like a procedural cop dramas or things like that get him some standalone complex.

543
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:02,505
Scott: Yeah It's pretty much.

544
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:05,959
Scott: don't go around telling people it sucks.

545
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:09,840
Scott: I don't like it, you know, if you're a big giant robot fan that that's great.

546
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,231
Scott: You can like your giant robots.

547
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:13,264
Scott: your giant robots are awesome But it's not the most.

548
00:34:13,364 --> 00:34:17,943
Scott: but if someone comes up to you and says I want to be an anime fan I'm thinking about it.

549
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:18,665
Scott: What should I watch?

550
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:20,572
Scott: Don't be like you should totally watch.

551
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,860
Scott: get a robo because that will not work.

552
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,050
Scott: No, you will turn them off of anime better.

553
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,040
Rym: It's all about great King Mazen Kaiser.

554
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:39,134
Scott: It's like you're gonna make a bad impression on them even if you know It's something that you like, you know, and I think another part of the problem Is that some of these people out there they know this.

555
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:42,125
Scott: I'm not telling them anything new But they're thinking in their minds.

556
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:46,480
Scott: Well, if they're not gonna like the giant robots, I'd rather have them not like anime.

557
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:48,992
Scott: You know, it's like they don't want to make an anime fan.

558
00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:50,500
Scott: They want to make a giant robot fan.

559
00:34:50,580 --> 00:35:00,240
Rym: I think that goes back into the same mentality that causes people to Name-drop instead of actually giving I guess useful recommendations based on a person's interests.

560
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:06,326
Scott: This is actually something I've noticed in like reviews in general I mean serious reviewing.

561
00:35:06,366 --> 00:35:08,312
Scott: people don't seem to have this problem as much.

562
00:35:08,412 --> 00:35:16,839
Scott: but like people just giving sort of like their offhand Reviews and forums and blogs around the net, you know, people don't seem to be able to sort of.

563
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:36,265
Scott: you know Review is an entirely subjective thing But people's don't seem to be able to separate like their personal, you know quirks and tastes in their review from the sort of actual, you know criteria critic Criticisms like.

564
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:47,220
Scott: you know, if you say something, you know has ugly character designs, you know That's sort of a general criticism Like if it's drawn poorly or you know, it's skipping frames in the animation or something.

565
00:35:47,664 --> 00:36:00,360
Rym: General criticism, but if it's just Escaflowne or something like and something designed by Amano or you just don't like it personally then I think the good reviewer says Well, if you're like me, you won't like these character designs.

566
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:07,140
Rym: But if you're like if you're the kind of person who likes really really thin angular people then this is your show.

567
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,832
Scott: I'm thinking more along the lines of you know, the people who are like.

568
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:11,580
Scott: this show has no robots.

569
00:36:11,682 --> 00:36:12,679
Scott: Therefore it sucks.

570
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:19,883
Rym: It's all the people who say this show has robots and therefore it's like someone on the forum said something to the effect of blah blah blah.

571
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:27,919
Rym: ribbon Scott really loved those giant robot shows and I found that interesting because I actually dislike the vast majority of giant robot shows.

572
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:35,240
Rym: In fact, I like the idea of a giant robot is way cool Yes, but I feel like I like it mostly in an ironic way like giant Robo.

573
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:39,139
Rym: Well one that show is not what you expect and that's that's the time.

574
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,527
Rym: I wouldn't call that a giant robot show almost.

575
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:42,290
Rym: It's something special.

576
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:50,700
Rym: Yeah, but like shows like Escaflowne It has robots in it, but it's not a giant robot show.

577
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,898
Rym: In fact, it if anything it's a shoujo with shounen elements or shounen with shoujo elements.

578
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:57,440
Rym: fantasy.

579
00:36:58,362 --> 00:37:03,565
Scott: Yeah, I mean there were a lot of people, you know when we start did our prince of the nothing thing They were like, yeah, I don't.

580
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,673
Scott: I don't like fantasy books.

581
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,540
Scott: I'm like what it's like.

582
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,591
Rym: What do you mean you don't like fantasy book?

583
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:09,892
Scott: Well, it's.

584
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:11,280
Scott: it's like how do you write?

585
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,200
Scott: Oh, it's like you just don't like the theme that's on top of the actual story.

586
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:16,545
Scott: It's like how do you?

587
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:22,566
Scott: I don't understand how people can have such sort of especially narrow Short-sighted sort of taste.

588
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:29,383
Rym: I knew someone at RIT who loved the Star Wars novels, but hated Fantasy novels.

589
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:38,105
Rym: then I was like I'm exact thing except I'll just replace the lightsaber with get Excalibur Exact kind of story.

590
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:39,028
Rym: Yeah, it's.

591
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:39,670
Scott: no, you know, it's.

592
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:40,894
Scott: I think it's the same thing.

593
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:41,556
Scott: We have video games.

594
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,887
Rym: Yeah, a lot of like.

595
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:48,067
Rym: a lot of people say oh, I like I hate science fiction But the only science fiction they know is Star Trek.

596
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:51,320
Rym: They don't know about the Heinlein's and the Asimov's the speculative fiction.

597
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:51,864
Scott: Yeah to them.

598
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:54,160
Scott: It's like science fiction means spaceships.

599
00:37:54,642 --> 00:38:03,057
Rym: No, not really, but at the same time inside his science there are people who also bother me where they say no It's only truly science fiction if it's an Asimov or a Heinlein's like.

600
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:05,740
Rym: no Can have dumb speculative fiction.

601
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:08,583
Scott: But it's like.

602
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:13,977
Scott: a lot of people seem to only judge things and see things on the surface level like.

603
00:38:14,018 --> 00:38:18,522
Scott: how many times do we Like, you know we get two different video games, you know And like.

604
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:29,580
Scott: we'll look at like Ikaruga and Gradius and we'll say those are two completely different games and someone else will look at him And say but they're both shooting spaceships and I'm like no one is a memorization game and what is a reflexes game?

605
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:35,396
Scott: They're completely different and unrelated and that's sort of the same thing that happens here with anime and everything else.

606
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:45,619
Scott: is we look through the surface You know, we look at say You know I'm trying to think of to cover and we judge the book by its cover, right?

607
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,233
Rym: Right, of course The one thing I can say is the prince of nothing books the originals at least.

608
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:56,254
Rym: there was nothing on the cover But some fancy script and the title and the author's name and now the cover has.

609
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:57,900
Rym: now the cover has a picture of some guy.

610
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:04,140
Scott: I'm just trying to think of two anime that have completely different themes on the surface level but are very similar underneath.

611
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:04,742
Rym: It's guys.

612
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:09,278
Rym: easier to find two shows that look like they're exactly the same but actually aren't.

613
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:14,954
Scott: I guess Mmm, well like Evangelion looks a lot like wrote, you know other robot shows.

614
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:16,820
Rym: It even starts like a giant robot show.

615
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:23,765
Rym: Yes, well like interesting first episode and then it's well like this giant robot This one and this one.

616
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:24,527
Rym: but big Oh.

617
00:39:24,707 --> 00:39:29,080
Scott: big Oh looks a lot like road even more like giant robot shows in Batman.

618
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:38,092
Rym: big Oh is just a show where every episode the big Oh punches some other robot in the face But it's not even close to a giant robot show.

619
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:40,767
Scott: if you look underneath the surface It's actually I.

620
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:45,596
Rym: I guess that's the thing A lot of people would write off a show like big Oh because they're like, oh giant robots.

621
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:46,420
Rym: That's anime crap.

622
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:53,360
Rym: But big Oh in my opinion and I'm dead serious here I think we did this is our first final thought show we did on big Oh a long time.

623
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:55,166
Rym: Yeah it was a long time ago.

624
00:39:55,728 --> 00:40:00,364
Rym: big Oh is one of the more meaningful more interesting and Deeper anime out there.

625
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:01,468
Scott: like definitely like.

626
00:40:01,688 --> 00:40:07,294
Scott: in the top 15 or 20, I'd say I definitely say I mean plus There's also this shows out there.

627
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:07,819
Scott: What was that?

628
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,587
Scott: What the hell was the show with the?

629
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:16,744
Scott: we're all that it looked like a normal cute happy evil cries of the Higurashi Higurashi.

630
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:17,208
Scott: no, not good.

631
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:17,611
Scott: Coronee.

632
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:20,605
Rym: Yeah Emily reminded us.

633
00:40:20,645 --> 00:40:20,987
Rym: Yeah.

634
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,553
Scott: So yeah that show.

635
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:24,100
Scott: you can't be judging the shows.

636
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,432
Rym: I remember the sad show because that was if I remember.

637
00:40:27,452 --> 00:40:30,999
Rym: we're you know, we pick a random anime like alright Let's watch episode one of something.

638
00:40:31,446 --> 00:40:39,360
Rym: so we Turn on this show and we see someone brutally beating someone else to death with a baseball bat and there's blood everywhere.

639
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,628
Rym: We're like, okay kind of show is this?

640
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:46,008
Rym: some kind of murder drama some kind of psycho drama Some kind of.

641
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:52,943
Rym: it's not a magical girl unless she's shown it or shoujo bat, but That's not.

642
00:40:52,963 --> 00:40:53,746
Scott: you look at fancy.

643
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:56,636
Scott: Lala you because a magical girl look like princess tutu.

644
00:40:56,737 --> 00:40:57,680
Scott: Oh, it's a magical girl.

645
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:06,677
Rym: And yeah, I'm watching princess tutu now and while it is a magical girl show So is utenna in a lot of regards, but that does not mean it's on the same level as Sailor Moon.

646
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:13,580
Scott: Cardcaptor Sakura Is a magical girl show straight up with no with no not much deep action going on.

647
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,489
Scott: Yeah, Sailor Moon was pretty much just car.

648
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:17,700
Rym: Sailor Moon was deeper than Cardcaptor.

649
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:21,516
Scott: only a little More depends on which one you want.

650
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:28,381
Rym: I think you're Underestimating the depth of Sailor Moon and overestimating the depth of Cardcaptor.

651
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:28,622
Scott: Yeah.

652
00:41:29,143 --> 00:41:47,870
Scott: Anyway, the point is when you recommend anime to people who are not, you know into anime you need to a Suggest things that are popular to most people and not just your favorite because you actually want them to like anime Even if they don't end up liking the anime you like better they be an anime fan than not.

653
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:53,555
Rym: now remember and like the Strategy here if you want to just think about it in terms of I'm gonna get them into this.

654
00:41:53,836 --> 00:42:01,088
Rym: you start broad You show them Cowboy Bebop or some Miyazaki's and you say like check it out Animation is good anime can be good.

655
00:42:01,529 --> 00:42:04,259
Rym: and then you you you step it up a little bit like well you liked that.

656
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:07,800
Rym: Well, this is a little bit more for the refined fat.

657
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:09,042
Rym: This is you know The next step.

658
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:19,185
Rym: check this out and you and you start them on Cowboy Bebop and you end them on Great King Mazin Fist Kaiser Joe, right Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

659
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:23,700
Scott: and you gotta ask him you got to figure out what their personal taste is in other things.

660
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,613
Scott: You know do they what books they like what comics they like what movies?

661
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:28,240
Scott: and then you can find anime.

662
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,945
Scott: They're very similar to those.

663
00:42:30,306 --> 00:42:35,460
Rym: the only anime John the only genre you're really not gonna find an anime is Western style horror.

664
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:36,566
Rym: You really don't see that.

665
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:39,280
Scott: No, you're gonna find weird Asian horror, which I actually prefer.

666
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:42,307
Scott: Yeah, it depends actually what I really like.

667
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:43,070
Scott: the bug boy.

668
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:49,696
Rym: what I was about to say is I really like the quirky Asian Quote-unquote horror like I really like Kataro.

669
00:42:49,796 --> 00:42:54,380
Scott: the guitar was good I like it's our own and I. I was just actually right before we did the show.

670
00:42:54,741 --> 00:43:02,750
Scott: I was looking at my shelf and I saw the bug boy and I remembered how much I like the bug boy So happy in the ocean I liked it.

671
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,780
Scott: the best part is me is going down the slide at the playground.

672
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:22,191
Scott: And Then lastly you have to put your personal tastes aside And examine the shows below the surface level to determine what kind of show they actually Are and not you know, what kind of show I mean.

673
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:22,733
Scott: beard to say.

674
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:30,681
Rym: you say you meet someone who isn't an anime But like the idea of giant robots beating each other to death like just the sets the rocks off and that's what they like Like.

675
00:43:31,123 --> 00:43:34,560
Rym: oh man, you're telling me I can see giant robots fighting.

676
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:44,720
Rym: You don't want to show them Ava cuz it's gonna start with giant robots fighting and then it's gonna turn into this Philosophical rant fest and they're gonna get confused and wander away and probably hate you.

677
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,419
Scott: Yeah, that is the person who needs some ghetto robos.

678
00:43:47,741 --> 00:43:54,480
Rym: Yes that some rust hurricanes up in some the messenger's ease or maybe or the same deal.

679
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:55,824
Rym: They like giant robots.

680
00:43:56,165 --> 00:43:57,550
Rym: Don't show them giant robot.

681
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:03,420
Rym: It might be confused because the name giant robo You figure if someone likes giant robots.

682
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:09,114
Rym: But no that show is not about what you think it's about and the robot cries and no man.

683
00:44:09,234 --> 00:44:09,595
Scott: Yeah.

684
00:44:09,895 --> 00:44:12,003
Rym: Yeah, I Don't know.

685
00:44:12,023 --> 00:44:13,862
Rym: I think that I think we've met our point Well enough.

686
00:44:14,023 --> 00:44:14,565
Rym: the.

687
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:20,105
Rym: the catalyst for this show was that someone asked in the forums at one point What should I watch to get into anime?

688
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:26,965
Rym: and I'm gonna be honest pretty much every suggestion that people gave in that thread was just Horrible.

689
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:32,829
Rym: Yeah, like there was a lot of them were good shows But that's not how you convince someone to like.

690
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:40,191
Rym: your thing is by showing them the like the weirdest or the most Extreme or the most inside examples of your thing.

691
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:42,640
Rym: you start broad and then you narrow down.

692
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:54,089
Scott: Yep, you know I do find it interesting though a lot of the old-school fans They all a lot of them came in like through the sci-fi's, you know The Akira's the Matsumoto's the Robo tech macross.

693
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:59,434
Scott: is that you know, that was really like the big original draw I think Including myself.

694
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:06,647
Rym: Yeah Well there I mean there was a lot of all the niche fandoms kind of had a lot of overlap in terms of if Nerds and geeks get together.

695
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:13,554
Rym: nerds and geeks tended to like very specific things And now we're having this kind of flowering of geek or Renaissance man.

696
00:45:13,835 --> 00:45:14,076
Scott: Yep.

697
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,773
Scott: Oh So this is how we can make more anime fans people.

698
00:45:18,793 --> 00:45:20,640
Scott: you want more anime fans not less, right?

699
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,744
Scott: Okay, so do what we say.

700
00:45:22,146 --> 00:45:35,118
Rym: so again in case you forgot cowboy vbop Evangelion eska flown a try gun Miyazaki anything directed by Miyazaki or Satoshi khan or poker poker.

701
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:37,286
Scott: Oh, so Poker Rose is a great.

702
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,720
Scott: Oh, man, you can't really you can't be pretty much no matter who it is.

703
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,135
Scott: You can't go wrong saying this is your first anime because the pig in the airplane.

704
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:45,120
Rym: We got a review poker.

705
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,969
Scott: Oh, so I only watched it twice.

706
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:48,014
Scott: It was a while years ago.

707
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:49,200
Rym: I've seen it like seven times.

708
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,769
Scott: I got a two times man.

709
00:45:51,112 --> 00:46:03,560
Scott: I see a thing is like I think is might still be my number one Miyazaki But like pork erosos always like right on top of it and I think if I watched pork erosos, it might jump ahead again.

710
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:06,124
Scott: I don't know hard to say it's a tough I think.

711
00:46:06,325 --> 00:46:07,830
Rym: what the deal with pork erosos?

712
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,320
Rym: if you want to show it to someone is it because it's older?

713
00:46:10,862 --> 00:46:15,075
Rym: You can play up the one it still got all the charm of like a Ghibli movie.

714
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:18,303
Rym: Like you look at you're like wow And it's.

715
00:46:18,323 --> 00:46:21,480
Rym: you know, it's light-hearted, but there's some depth there and everything's great about it.

716
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:24,419
Rym: Animations really good and at the same time it's vintage.

717
00:46:24,801 --> 00:46:26,468
Rym: It looks old so you can plan to play the.

718
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,778
Rym: this is like some vintage animation.

719
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:29,240
Rym: Look at this.

720
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,888

Rym: I should watch a classic a classic at anything.

724
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,031
Rym: Yeah, let's go and then you watch it and it's got that.

725
00:46:39,312 --> 00:46:41,920
Rym: it's got this these quirky charm elements.

726
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:49,792
Rym: I mean the main character is a pig but yet no one really talks about that and he flies a plane And and that's it.

727
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:50,497
Rym: That's normal.
