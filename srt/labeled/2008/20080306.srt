1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,669
Rym: It's Thursday March 6th.

2
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:12,953
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,153 --> 00:00:20,759
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights Tonight the tale of why there was no show two days prior.

4
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:25,813
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,503 --> 00:00:35,010
Rym: So as we alluded yesterday last night and as you were probably aware there was no show on Tuesday.

6
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:38,381
Rym: Normally, that's just because it's New York City.

7
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:43,510
Rym: a lot of times when things happen here Even if they're not the craziest news They tend to make the national news.

8
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,609
Rym: But because there was more important news going on a lot of people actually didn't know what happened to us on Tuesday.

9
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,665
Scott: yesterday It was like the biggest news day in a long time and the day before do all the news.

10
00:00:55,726 --> 00:01:01,425
Scott: people were probably like yes Fucking news goddamn, but at the same time they were like fuck.

11
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:05,337
Rym: I have to work fuck Yeah, Tuesday was crazy.

12
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:08,468
Rym: I mean it was a my Super Bowl again Baraka.

13
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:13,885
Rym: Yeah, I'm not gonna talk about that, but the elections are close.

14
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,150
Rym: I want to talk about it though.

15
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:15,772
Scott: What do you it?

16
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,962
Scott: What do you have to say that the news didn't already say?

17
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:19,650
Rym: the news didn't say crap?

18
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,253
Scott: Uh-huh so what?

19
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,024
Scott: but everything you know about it is just from the news.

20
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:27,275
Scott: so if the news only said crap You know what you know crap?

21
00:01:27,436 --> 00:01:31,809
Rym: no because you see I read blogs and oh cuz the blogs they know.

22
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:33,655
Rym: you know I know Barack Obama.

23
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:34,438
Rym: He's in fact.

24
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,582
Rym: He's in right there.

25
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:36,405
Scott: He's your best friend.

26
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:37,890
Scott: You call him on the phone every night.

27
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:41,929
Rym: We've actually got him here live in the studio, and I would if I had his number.

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:55,070
Rym: yeah Anyway, so uh we're gonna talk about that because we realize that Our experiences on Tuesday if nothing else kind of constitute one of those geek fables.

29
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:57,090
Rym: We haven't had a geek fable in quite some time.

30
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,361
Scott: We sort of hope forgot that whole geek fable.

31
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,250
Scott: how to not suck deal, but we should bring that back.

32
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,377
Scott: I think that's our Thursday foundation.

33
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:13,370
Scott: I think Thursday's been dry, so if we go back to our roots on Thursday We might find some some artists had like their blue periods or their metal periods or whatever.

34
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:14,795
Rym: It seems like GeekNights.

35
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:18,489
Rym: Thursdays had the movies period where we reviewed a movie every week.

36
00:02:18,736 --> 00:02:25,446
Rym: Yeah And then we moved on into talking about food a lot And then we had the how to not suck it until we ran out of we sucked it.

37
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:26,390
Rym: how to not sucking?

38
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:28,600
Scott: Yeah, let's go back to you fables.

39
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:30,269
Rym: I think so cuz at least for now.

40
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:43,839
Rym: There's a lot to learn from our lives because once again We have triumphed or we're really good at taking Completely mundane things and trying to ham-fist some sort of moral into them, man So I was eating this peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

41
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:46,369
Rym: ah I don't think I can make that epic.

42
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:48,362
Rym: No, I think I could.

43
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:49,570
Scott: it was so fucking good.

44
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,559
Scott: Let me tell you the secret wheat bread.

45
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:55,855
Rym: so how to not suck at making a PB and J Step one not white bread.

46
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:58,242
Rym: first off you got to take the peanuts right.

47
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,767
Rym: don't get crunchy peanut butter.

48
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:00,770
Rym: stuff is usually nasty.

49
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:01,854
Scott: No, you know you do.

50
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:06,430
Rym: don't get normal peanut butter and then crunch up some fresh peanuts.

51
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:07,975
Scott: No, you're a fool.

52
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:13,170
Scott: Also, you see while I purchase the skippy peanut butter also you guys you want apricot jelly.

53
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:14,825
Scott: Yeah, that's apricot.

54
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:22,710
Scott: Jelly is good But while I you know I purpose I personally buy skippy peanut butter because that is the brand I like this available in the store.

55
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,677
Scott: That is not the best option.

56
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:32,903
Scott: No no no the best option is to go to the deli If you have a not shit supermarket and get the fresh just fucking made in the store.

57
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,270
Rym: peanut butter farmers markets are also good.

58
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:45,355
Scott: Yeah, I guess sometimes Usually the best place the one supermarket I know as excellent peanut butter is line No Publix in Florida.

59
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:50,693
Scott: if you go to the deli counter and ask for peanut butter pretty much every Publix has amazing peanut butter at the Deli counter.

60
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,806
Rym: all right Darryl Surratt go get some peanut butter.

61
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:53,289
Rym: there you go.

62
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:55,826
Scott: I wonder if he has Publix or if he has like Winn-Dixie.

63
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:59,927
Rym: well We'll find out if he's listening because he'll I'll get one of those messages a week later.

64
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:02,928
Rym: even likes peanut But he'll just be like yes, and I'll be like what?

65
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,239
Rym: Anyway, so uh yeah, I guess we should talk about some news.

66
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:15,326
Rym: I'm gonna hold Scott off new my news because Scott's news is uh No one was paying attention to the news at my job because you know we're busy unlike other jobs.

67
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:16,389
Rym: We do work all the time.

68
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:31,169
Rym: I'll say this I've had more fun doing this job Where I actually do work that I've ever had in a job before with the possible exception of the job at RIT Where I was a confidential courier.

69
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:33,559
Scott: You like being a confidential courier.

70
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:35,890
Rym: You know what because RIT jobs all pay the same.

71
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,501
Rym: It doesn't matter you get paid crap, and you don't do any work.

72
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:44,043
Scott: well you get paid not according to have what you do But according to the the level of the position you're.

73
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:45,188
Rym: it's kind of like the government.

74
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,675
Scott: the face It's like the per.

75
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:49,589
Scott: you know the person who was my boss when I was a student worker at RIT.

76
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,974
Scott: You know they.

77
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:55,870
Scott: she basically went and tried to make our the job that me and this other kid sort of shared.

78
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:57,389
Scott: You know ten hours a week each.

79
00:04:57,993 --> 00:05:03,499
Scott: She tried to sort of make that position the highest level position She could get it to be at the student employment.

80
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,350
Rym: actually my last job at RIT was the second highest level.

81
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:09,178
Rym: No, I made like eight dollars an hour.

82
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,543
Scott: You know what I realized.

83
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:12,709
Scott: What do you think minimum wage is?

84
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,815
Rym: Like five something?

85
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:18,450
Scott: no, it's like six something and it's gonna be seven something.

86
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,133
Rym: It should be.

87
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:23,090
Scott: it might even I think in like a some years it might even get up to eat something.

88
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,755
Scott: You know what it should.

89
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:24,017
Scott: New York.

90
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:25,690
Rym: It's like has a higher minimum way.

91
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,972
Scott: You know New York State is much higher than the federal minimum Which is what it.

92
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:35,610
Scott: but actually the federal minimum wage is gonna go up and force the New York one to go up by a Little bit then the federal ones gonna go up again.

93
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,970
Scott: I was looking at a chart on the wall in the office near the sink.

94
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:45,453
Rym: Oh that man that chart that must be posted here under penalty of whatever the generic have to buy it at Staples labor chart The.

95
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:50,710
Rym: if you get hurt at work you can call these people well, that's the the word compensation.

96
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,837
Rym: Well, there's all those charts.

97
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:55,888
Rym: They're like your company can't do this to you And this is to you and they can't do this to you.

98
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,175
Rym: Yeah, you're not allowed to do this.

99
00:05:57,436 --> 00:06:00,410
Scott: Staples basically sells to the federal one in the state one.

100
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,630
Scott: He just put them both up and each one sort of has the combination of all the little things that needs to have anyway.

101
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:10,084
Rym: Yeah, but I knew Adam Smith said minimum wage necessary.

102
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,408
Rym: All right, I go by Adam Smith.

103
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:12,010
Scott: What's your news?

104
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:27,030
Rym: Well speaking of Adam Smith One thing about New York City that is wonderful and horrible mostly wonderful because I don't care is that if you want a Versace or a Dior or a Prada or a full X or any of those things?

105
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:42,466
Rym: Rolik say what you do is full X. is you head down to or folklies a place called Chinatown and You can buy you know legitimate Chinese Versace bags for like five bucks.

106
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:48,029
Scott: in other words It's just a completely normal five dollar bag that happens to save for a space on it.

107
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:57,030
Scott: Of course, you know what a Versace bag is a completely normal five dollar bag that happens to save for a space on it only it costs a bajillion dollars.

108
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,470
Rym: Because I've wandered into some of those designer crazy stores and looked at some of these because there's stuff for men too.

109
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:03,671
Rym: Like.

110
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:08,250
Rym: there are designer messenger bags that don't look at like a Tag Heuer watch.

111
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,000
Scott: That's that's something that you don't want.

112
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,150
Rym: Well watch our chronometer.

113
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:15,610
Scott: It's it's a. yes it they're fancy.

114
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:24,382
Rym: No What you got to do is you go to have one sponsors that tells you the kind of money to go to the sharper image And get those like Soviet surplus like bomber chronometers.

115
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:25,064
Scott: No, you don't.

116
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:25,686
Scott: Yeah, you do.

117
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:34,167
Rym: Anyway, anyway You can get everything down there for super cheap Including the photoshops and the adobe.

118
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:50,976
Rym: adobe I actually have and I still use them because the thing is they're super high quality And I really don't feel bad about this at all, but I bought some really fancy Quote-unquote like designer leather hat like black driving gloves Down in Chinatown for four dollars.

119
00:07:51,398 --> 00:07:52,260
Rym: total bootlegs.

120
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:52,782
Rym: They're just.

121
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:53,805
Scott: what did they do?

122
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:54,487
Scott: What did they say?

123
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:55,370
Scott: some brand on them?

124
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:56,002
Scott: Yeah, they do.

125
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:57,854
Rym: Okay worn off now.

126
00:07:57,995 --> 00:08:02,487
Scott: So I figure you just go down there and buy generic leather gloves for four dollars.

127
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:03,450
Rym: I also have another.

128
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:07,950
Rym: They're thin solates but thins a late is spelled wrong.

129
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:10,918
Rym: You know, that's crazy.

130
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,701
Scott: They're not they're not.

131
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,130
Scott: no, they're not even bootlegging the name brand.

132
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:20,488
Scott: They're bootlegging the the trademark of the patented like insulation material.

133
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:21,150
Rym: You know what though?

134
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:24,590
Scott: That's like if they sold like dare text boots.

135
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:32,090
Rym: It seemed just as warm and just as comfortable and I still have both those pairs of gloves.

136
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,998
Rym: They haven't worn out at all.

137
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:33,462
Rym: They're great.

138
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:39,809
Rym: Yeah Meanwhile, I spot like $40 ski gloves when I was a kid and those wore out after like two seasons.

139
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,110
Scott: When you're a kid, you know technology of gloves was not as good as it is now.

140
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,770
Rym: Yeah, I definitely did learn that because ski technology is of course technology of toy has decreased.

141
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:57,939
Rym: Yes toys need to be made out of metal and if they shoot something they need to shoot it at eye breaking speed eye Breaking like how about gut-piercing?

142
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,005
Scott: anyway spring-loaded.

143
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:05,039
Rym: so New York City Decided to crack down on this and you know what?

144
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,666
Rym: It's trivial to crack down on this.

145
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:09,990
Scott: basically walk down the street You open your eyeballs.

146
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:18,445
Rym: Oh, look They said it is done a bunch of cops down to Canal Street and just roughed Everybody up because everybody was selling bootleg shit and there's.

147
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:21,255
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about the details But it's this crazy.

148
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,746
Rym: like they they busted a lot of people.

149
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:28,998
Rym: Yep, but Here's what bothers me about this article.

150
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:35,382
Rym: I'm not gonna debate the rightness or wrongness of Bootlegging or fighting bootlegging because it's a complicated issue.

151
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:37,370
Scott: It's mostly an issue of trademark infringement.

152
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:42,009
Rym: Yes, and I mean these people are breaking the law and what they're doing is wrong on a number of levels.

153
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,109
Rym: However, I'm going to quote a sentence from the article.

154
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:50,850
Rym: Well, actually no, I want to quote this other sentence first from the New York Police Commissioner.

155
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,083
Rym: Nobody's being tricked here.

156
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,707
Rym: Everybody knows what this stuff is.

157
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:00,497
Rym: My knockoff good see my weight.

158
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:05,250
Scott: if people know it's knockoff goods then there's no dilution of trademark going on.

159
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,557
Scott: So where is the wrong seat?

160
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:08,400
Rym: I'm not a lawyer.

161
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,223
Rym: So I'm not sure.

162
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:12,977
Rym: Yeah, but I can say this I'm not talking from a legal standpoint.

163
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:15,990
Scott: I'm arguing from the standpoint of what harm are they doing?

164
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,612
Scott: So it should.

165
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:20,210
Scott: should it be okay not be speaking of what harm are they doing?

166
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:27,889
Scott: Here's the sentence that bothers me because I want to do a whole People honestly not buying real for say's because they can buy fake per se.

167
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:33,650
Rym: I'll just say right now because I know someone's gonna try because we know how to pronounce these things.

168
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:38,430
Rym: We're making fun of them much like how movies you should see a really good podcast.

169
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,484
Rym: It's like Joe reviewed Alfred Hitchcock's classic pessite show.

170
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:43,347
Scott: Oh beside Joe.

171
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:44,350
Rym: That's a really good movie.

172
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:48,476
Scott: You know before like I knew the word psycho But I didn't always know how to spell it.

173
00:10:48,677 --> 00:10:55,403
Scott: and when like Street Fighter 2 was like sort of a new game on the consoles And I got the instruction book and it said M bison.

174
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:59,200
Scott: His move was the pessite show crusher Because I didn't know better.

175
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:00,913
Rym: Ah You know what?

176
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:02,886
Rym: I'm sure no Bunga is right there with you.

177
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:10,031
Scott: No Bunga No Bunga, he's very he's very ambitious Dr.

178
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,216
Rym: Chaios, dr.

179
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:11,578
Scott: Chaios.

180
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,964
Scott: No, I knew dr.

181
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:13,467
Scott: Chaos.

182
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:27,957
Rym: anyway Here's the the the the sentence that bothers me in this article because this has come up in the video game industry in the anime Industry in the software industry and now it's here on Thursday in meatspace Quotes, I'm building up to this.

183
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:30,083
Rym: you see in New York.

184
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:40,323
Rym: The trade was worth 80 billion dollars and cost the city $1,000,000,000 a year in lost sales tax revenue now.

185
00:11:41,185 --> 00:11:42,489
Scott: Oh, they're not paying sales tax.

186
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:43,655
Rym: Well, that's not.

187
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:46,430
Rym: no as in this is what they're saying.

188
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:57,223
Rym: all of those people who bought the knockoff Versace Would have bought a real Versace if they hadn't been able to get the bootleg.

189
00:11:57,563 --> 00:12:00,130
Rym: So therefore 80 billion dollars.

190
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:11,090
Rym: The city lost a billion dollars in sales tax because obviously all those people would have bought the real ones and paid the exorbitant sales Tax because I'm sure all those people could afford the real ones.

191
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:22,685
Scott: I would like a $5,000 bag as opposed to the $5 bag with the same bag amount of money that perhaps None of the people who bought those bootlegs would have ever even considered.

192
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:27,679
Scott: buying a real legitimate Designer Versace, I would have to pretty much agree.

193
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:31,570
Scott: I I can't see anyone or I think we really think about it, right?

194
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,922
Scott: Okay, you got someone who just wants a bag.

195
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:37,990
Scott: They don't care about the name brand, right?

196
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,797
Scott: The name brand doesn't really mean anything to them.

197
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:41,023
Scott: They just want a bag.

198
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:45,205
Scott: They're not gonna buy a $500 thousand dollar bag no matter what.

199
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:46,010
Rym: nor are they going?

200
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,790
Scott: So it doesn't matter if this bag says Versace on it or not.

201
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:52,689
Scott: They're going to buy the cheap functional bag that suits them.

202
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:55,459
Rym: now They're probably gonna buy a legitimate bag not the knockoff bag.

203
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:58,773
Rym: the knockoff bags very specifically for people who want to appear hip But right.

204
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,370
Scott: so so take the rest of the people right?

205
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,221
Scott: These are people who actually care about the name brand.

206
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:09,200
Scott: right the name brand means something to them But they can't you know they?

207
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:20,770
Scott: so if the name brand means something to them And they could afford it Wouldn't they get the real stuff and then say look at me because they're so vain right that they care about name brands?

208
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:21,734
Scott: They would say look at me.

209
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:23,159
Scott: I have a non knockoff one.

210
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:23,902
Scott: I'm special.

211
00:13:24,444 --> 00:13:31,810
Scott: if they're buying the knockoff one Obviously they can't afford the real one and they wouldn't have bought it if the knockoff wasn't available.

212
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:36,467
Rym: I am highly dubious of New York City claiming that they lost a billion dollars a year from this.

213
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:37,350
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much.

214
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:51,810
Rym: I like the fact that basically what this Bloomberg told the news is that the city is going to force the landlords to get push All those people out and if they don't put legitimate businesses in their place there might be some big trouble in Chinatown.

215
00:13:52,474 --> 00:14:01,670
Scott: Well, you know if they do put legitimate businesses in there I mean it doesn't really upset me too much and some of those legitimate businesses might be things that I want.

216
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,098
Scott: So you know it'll be okay.

217
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,049
Rym: Yeah, I just find this.

218
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:11,650
Rym: You know, I don't I really don't want knockoff merchandise personally no, but it's just it bothers me that so many people.

219
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:17,290
Rym: I mean, it's one thing to say, you know piracy is wrong and knockoffs are wrong and fighting It's a good thing cuz that's that's fine.

220
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:29,233
Rym: But to claim that all of that you lost all that money Because all those people would have bought your product if they couldn't have fired at it is not entirely true and not entirely legit Completely false.

221
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:29,975
Rym: All right.

222
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,103
Rym: So your news is much more important.

223
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:34,030
Rym: So yeah, you shouldn't spend too long on this.

224
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:39,790
Scott: I figured I couldn't save this until Monday, but a lot of people don't realize today was an appley day.

225
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:42,499
Rym: It was a big appley day, right?

226
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:45,709
Rym: We're talking about New York City two times a big appley day.

227
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:54,117
Scott: Okay, so basically Steve Jobs, he didn't say much but he had the.

228
00:14:54,218 --> 00:15:14,070
Scott: he had his VPS who know more about what was going on saying stuff and Basically the only thing they came out with is the SDK for the iPhone which means People can make software for the iPhone right and looking at it from the standpoint of someone making Applications they made it pretty nice.

229
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:20,650
Scott: It's gonna be nice and easy to make iPhone applications if that's what you want to do and you have those skills and the tools available to you, right?

230
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:27,543
Scott: however I There's one issue that's not super 100% clear.

231
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:28,647
Scott: That's basically okay.

232
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:29,590
Scott: I make the application.

233
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:30,890
Scott: How do I give it to people right?

234
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,390
Scott: Well, what they're gonna do is they're gonna have not iTunes.

235
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:36,079
Scott: But we're like now.

236
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:41,310
Scott: or if you want to get an application for your iPod, you know You buy it on iTunes and then you transfer it to your iPod with the wire.

237
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,770
Scott: They're gonna have a store on the iPhone.

238
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:54,030
Scott: So on the iPhone there's a button that says, you know apps and you push it and then all the applications show up and you Push them and you I guess you touch them and they install on your iPhone, right?

239
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,529
Scott: now if you make one you sort of have to get your application into the store.

240
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:05,269
Scott: and If you decide you want to charge money for your application Let's say I make a game and I want to charge 10 bucks.

241
00:16:05,874 --> 00:16:11,350
Scott: Every time someone buys that game for 10 bucks I get 7 bucks and Apple gets 3 bucks and that's how it's gonna work.

242
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:18,110
Scott: If I want to give the game away for free, then I don't have to pay anything It's just it gets given away for free, which is which is pretty nice.

243
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:24,941
Rym: Yeah, I mean while obviously Apple's going to have a lot of control over this and they're not gonna let us unlock Cards or anything.

244
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:33,730
Rym: Yeah, but I Can also see that because it's a piece of hardware like that and there is a lot of chance for problems or malicious applications.

245
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:45,750
Rym: While I don't fully agree with exactly how they're handling this and I think they could be a little bit more lenient I'm kind of okay with it because I can see how trivial it would be for people to make really really malicious applications.

246
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:53,654
Scott: I think they're trying to avoid the palm situation where you know people have these trios and they install all these applications on them and they crash all the time and they're Unstable.

247
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:56,010
Scott: and what you know, they're trying to put some quality control.

248
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:03,130
Scott: But the real question is is they they gave some details as to which applications would be allowed in the store and which would not.

249
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:05,940
Scott: For example, they said no porn applications.

250
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:07,425
Scott: There will not wait.

251
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:10,954
Rym: What kind of porn Application wouldn't that be?

252
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:11,696
Rym: Firefox?

253
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:15,530
Scott: Well, you could possibly make doki-doki mahoshin pan for the iPhone.

254
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:22,147
Scott: In fact, it would be multi-touch doki-doki mahoshin pan.

255
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:24,924
Rym: Oh snap Yeah, but I don't know.

256
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:25,810
Rym: I can't imagine.

257
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:28,317
Rym: Now I don't want to continue.

258
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,915
Scott: continue doki-doki mahoshin pan live-action Multi-touch iPhone.

259
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:33,317
Scott: Okay.

260
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:36,270
Scott: Okay with downloadable additional action.

261
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,602
Rym: Anyway, continue proceed.

262
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,650
Scott: There's not gonna know malicious applications.

263
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:49,399
Scott: So if I write an application that just takes your credit card information and gives it to me or just calls all your friends All the time and bought and relieves the nasty messages.

264
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:52,410
Rym: They're not gonna let that go through and that would be the best application.

265
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,739
Scott: well, I guess if it lets you know what it's doing, it doesn't on purpose right now.

266
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:02,448
Scott: and Wow, they're not going to allow an application that unlocks the SIM card and allows you to switch away from AT&T.

267
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:07,910
Rym: As Scott pointed out when we were talking over pizza, I like how engage it posted that question.

268
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,096
Scott: Yeah, cuz rare.

269
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:10,303
Scott: this is a rare thing.

270
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:27,698
Scott: if you should go to engage it You know for no other reason at this particular Apple event You had the rare rare Circumstance where they actually did a Q&A like Steve Jobs and his two VP guys sat there for 10 minutes and took questions From the press which is so fucking rare.

271
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:30,406
Scott: I mean usually he's just like here's the shit.

272
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:35,069
Scott: See you guys now He's like, okay, we will take questions and it was like oh snaps.

273
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:47,409
Scott: So in gadget was like let me let me read exactly what in gadget ass because they basically Phrased it in such a way to try to get Steve Jobs to give the wrong answer.

274
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:55,210
Rym: They using a combination of negative not allow us to not make fall applications that don't unlock the SIM card.

275
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:57,488
Scott: Yeah, so let me read it exactly.

276
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:02,606
Rym: Come on I'm not pausing this again not editing tonight.

277
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:04,432
Scott: Here we go In.

278
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:13,290
Scott: gadget asks will sim unlock software be considered software Not allowed in the App Store?

279
00:19:14,732 --> 00:19:17,864
Scott: The and then this is just a you know, they're they're live blog.

280
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:33,630
Scott: and it says answer colon a colon Steve colon parentheses pause parentheses double-quote dot-dot-dot Yes period quote space Laughter period.

281
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,076
Scott: So basically, I mean think about it.

282
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:40,210
Scott: will sim unlock software be considered software not allowed in the App Store?

283
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:42,038
Scott: Yes, you mean you said to think.

284
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:49,275
Scott: wait if I say yes, that means it's not allowed $20.

285
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:51,488
Scott: will this be considered not allowed in?

286
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:55,760
Scott: Yeah, that was a good good showing gadget way to go.

287
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:56,924
Scott: They asked the best question.

288
00:19:56,944 --> 00:19:58,890
Rym: I think yeah, what did gizmodo do?

289
00:19:59,331 --> 00:19:59,753
Scott: I don't know.

290
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:06,828
Scott: It doesn't because for all the other questions, it just says q a q a but for that one It says Q. we asked, you know.

291
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:12,550
Scott: But yeah, the only question I read this really sort of makes the iPhone hot stuff.

292
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:17,608
Scott: You know the only other things I have to say or that first of all the iPhone.

293
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:26,242
Scott: basically They added every feature that a corporate Company would want in a portable phone.

294
00:20:26,262 --> 00:20:28,450
Scott: So basically exchange integration.

295
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:35,830
Scott: They paid Microsoft money to make the iPhone work with Microsoft Exchange as well as that is possible.

296
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:42,574
Scott: full push email calendar syncing Everything and it's just full-on Hardcore.

297
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:45,549
Scott: so blackberry best watch the fuck out.

298
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:53,729
Scott: Also spore iPhone aim iPhone some other things you don't care about, you know.

299
00:20:55,551 --> 00:21:13,474
Scott: But yeah, basically this is pretty hot because it means the iPhone is gonna you know have applications that work And it's gonna be you know more open than some other platforms like say your Verizon phone but less open than say the palm and I don't know.

300
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:15,625
Scott: It kind of makes me want an iPhone a little more.

301
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:20,647
Scott: the only disappointments I have are number one where the Google Apps Google Apps.

302
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:21,189
Scott: Where are you?

303
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:25,405
Rym: Hello the Google Apps don't even work because we have Google for domains.

304
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:30,230
Scott: half our stuff doesn't work right I know because we have Google for domains instead of regular Gmail.

305
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:34,810
Scott: You think maybe having Google for domains would give us an advantage over people with regular Gmail?

306
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,999
Scott: No, it totally shafts you if you try and use the mobile stuff.

307
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,247
Rym: Yeah, I mean Google groups is anyway.

308
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:47,925
Rym: anyway and to What you lost your train of thought.

309
00:21:47,965 --> 00:21:48,589
Scott: sure it's over.

310
00:21:56,624 --> 00:21:58,938
Rym: Anyway Things of the day.

311
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:04,630
Rym: I'm not gonna talk about this a lot as pretty self-evident But some of my favorite people to ever live were the Duke.

312
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,890
Rym: By the Duke, I mean Duke Ellington not too ill duchet.

313
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:11,809
Rym: Not that he isn't awesome, but he might not have existed.

314
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:17,230
Scott: One dude with seven guns, that's silly six guns.

315
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:24,117
Rym: Yeah, it's six guns but yeah or Dizzy Gillespie or any of those people?

316
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:29,956
Rym: this is a blog I found that is just videos of Awesome trumpet players.

317
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:31,322
Rym: wouldn't you just need the audio?

318
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:32,306
Scott: Do you really need the video?

319
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:33,150
Rym: you need the video?

320
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,732
Scott: What does it add?

321
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:41,004
Rym: let me put it this way if you're a trumpet player besides watching like incredibly inflated cheeks That that was I don't know how he played that way.

322
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:49,295
Rym: It's not a good way to play But you get to see like a lot of famous trouble players use kind of weird trumpets They always had like their one weird thing.

323
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:51,503
Rym: and also there's some trumpet battles.

324
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:56,662
Rym: a lot of like a bunch of famous trumpet players get Together and they all kind of jam and it's it's cool.

325
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:57,344
Rym: So check this out.

326
00:22:57,364 --> 00:22:58,087
Rym: That's all I got to say.

327
00:22:58,147 --> 00:22:58,830
Rym: What do you want?

328
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,153
Rym: Trumpets.

329
00:23:00,637 --> 00:23:11,502
Scott: All right, so I found this dude on YouTube Via James Randi and his name on YouTube at least is captain Disillusion, I saw the camel case in the URL.

330
00:23:11,722 --> 00:23:19,184
Scott: Yeah, anyway captain disillusion here He he has some really high production values on his little YouTube videos that he does.

331
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:20,990
Rym: his special effects were actually pretty crazy.

332
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,381
Scott: Yeah, it's it's rather impressive the the quality of these videos.

333
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:35,979
Scott: And basically what he does is he sort of makes these Children targeted videos even though they're good for I think adults as well, but they're I guess Supposedly targeted towards children.

334
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:41,259
Scott: and he sort of says hey, look at this In a in a sort of children's show kind of way.

335
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:42,183
Scott: see this.

336
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:43,788
Scott: This is a video someone took.

337
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:44,250
Scott: you see that.

338
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:45,474
Scott: Yeah, that's not a ghost.

339
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:50,710
Scott: That's a lens flare or you know, hey, look at this see this video these people made.

340
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:52,560
Scott: Yeah, this is how they made that video.

341
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,243
Scott: It's not real.

342
00:23:53,324 --> 00:23:54,370
Scott: It's it's actually fake.

343
00:23:54,671 --> 00:24:07,389
Scott: like now the best one is there's a video you might have seen the video on the on YouTube before of a Penguin like bitch slapping another penguin and then that penguin falls through the ice and he shows you look it's actually a fake.

344
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:19,377
Scott: the the first penguin fell through the ice on its own and They just photoshopped in the slapping penguin, you know, and he shows you how it was done and it's it's very good for Sort of teaching people.

345
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:23,332
Scott: Hey, this is real and that's that's not real All right.

346
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:27,570
Rym: So, um, we're tired and we won't talk too long about this and we went kind of long yesterday.

347
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,252
Rym: So it's okay.

348
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:28,894
Scott: We can get to bed.

349
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,579
Rym: Yeah, that is necessary.

350
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,243
Scott: But very necessary.

351
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:34,610
Rym: So there's no show on Tuesdays.

352
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:53,036
Rym: I've said a bunch of times and the reason for that was that some Abandoned Prostitution filled building and that's not just me saying that that was actually in the news now Just collapsed around 345 on Tuesday at 124th Street and Park Avenue.

353
00:24:53,176 --> 00:25:05,376
Rym: now pretty much every Metro North train that goes anywhere near where we live goes through from Grand Central up, you know through Harlem and all that to 125th Street in Harlem goes.

354
00:25:05,396 --> 00:25:06,420
Scott: a lot of people don't realize this.

355
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:28,090
Scott: you go into Grand Central Station, right and There's a whole bunch of tracks in there, but all those tracks you know, they sort of mix together and mix together and mix together and Coming out of Grand Central, you know other than the subway which doesn't really count But all the commuter trains the other trains at Grand Central all of them go out on four tracks.

356
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:33,312
Scott: There are only four tracks that actually leave like the tunnel and come out into the sunlight You know.

357
00:25:33,613 --> 00:25:37,085
Scott: and they all all four of those tracks go straight to 125th Street.

358
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:45,490
Scott: So at 124th and Park If a building collapses, that's right next to the trains.

359
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:53,629
Rym: So all of them all for you Approximately two or three hundred thousand people use Metro North every day.

360
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:55,036
Scott: Yeah a lot.

361
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:56,523
Rym: So well that was from the news.

362
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:59,295
Rym: I didn't actually know how many I just know Sounds about right.

363
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:03,030
Rym: Yeah, cuz my trains always crowded my trains at the crack ass at dawn.

364
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,590
Scott: Yeah, and we're only on you know, one half of the Hudson line, you know This is the other half of the Hudson line.

365
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:12,030
Scott: Then there's two halves of the Harlem line and there's like three different or four different parts of the New Haven line.

366
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,153
Rym: Yeah, it's all.

367
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,757
Rym: there's a lot of people using Metro North.

368
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:26,730
Rym: but so basically this a semi abandoned under construction building Collapsed and it didn't get on the tracks, but they were worried that vibrations from trains might collapse it further.

369
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:32,830
Scott: Yeah, Metro North didn't give a shit about the building collapsing but the police are like don't run the trains like god damn it We can't do anything.

370
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:33,895
Rym: Yeah, there's also issues with.

371
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:37,370
Rym: they had to spend some time making sure the tracks were clear and making sure it was all okay.

372
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:49,081
Rym: Yeah, they always make sure of everything but as a result Scott calls me I'm getting I'm standing up to walk down Maybe get a drink or something to get on my train and Scott calls me.

373
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:51,188
Scott: cuz I get emails from the MTA.

374
00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:54,670
Rym: if anything happens To my train I do too, but I wasn't looking at the computer.

375
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,065
Rym: I was standing up and Scott calls me.

376
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:57,890
Rym: Scott never calls.

377
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,840
Scott: The funny thing is not like to check.

378
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,477
Scott: the email said 315 on it But it was well after 315 that I received that email.

379
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:11,552
Rym: So, uh, he says yeah Metro North's not running building collapse and I go ah Damn it What.

380
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:17,750
Scott: and I'm thinking well if I'm stuck here, I'll just go to my cousin's apartment or my aunt's house or something.

381
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:22,367
Rym: Yeah, actually all of us us and Emily and Alex and everyone there were places.

382
00:27:22,427 --> 00:27:23,230
Rym: we all could have stayed.

383
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:25,670
Rym: So we were pretty much already okay.

384
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:38,290
Rym: But still you know It kind of sucks to not be able to shower in your own house or change clothes or shave Or make a podcast not that we made one anyway, so I'm like trying to think of what we can do.

385
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,390
Scott: I'm like, well we can get a car service.

386
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:42,730
Rym: Now this is this is the whole geek fable part.

387
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:48,750
Rym: I'm not gonna like do the whole story and then lead up to the geek fable because I want to get this over with and Because it's pretty straightforward.

388
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:49,995
Rym: When does that?

389
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:56,948
Rym: when life gives you lemonade kick its ass so Lemonade has an ass.

390
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:04,730
Rym: Since when does lemonade have something pithy to say, you know like that old, uh, if life gives you lemons make lemonade.

391
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,995
Rym: But what if you're allergic to lemons?

392
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,520
Rym: if life gives you lemons?

393
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:09,066
Rym: Well, I'm just shit.

394
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:09,829
Scott: make shit aid.

395
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:24,050
Rym: But When faced with adversity pretty much there are two kinds of adversity Adversity that can be overcome through efforts and adversity over which you have no control.

396
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:26,542
Rym: You need to make the determination right away.

397
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:28,250
Rym: Can you control it?

398
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:34,082
Rym: If the answer is no There is no point in even caring at all at any point beyond that.

399
00:28:34,142 --> 00:28:36,588
Scott: for example, the Sun is going to explode.

400
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,508
Scott: well What the fuck can I do?

401
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,309
Scott: Not much sunglasses pretty much maybe a little little.

402
00:28:44,711 --> 00:28:50,350
Rym: Or if Metro North had said Metro North and or if like say there's I don't know.

403
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,435
Rym: I'm trying to think of something crazy.

404
00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:57,545
Rym: for whatever reason there was no way off of Manhattan Island Like there was no physical way to get off of Manhattan.

405
00:28:57,645 --> 00:29:00,239
Scott: Escape from Manhattan Movie called that.

406
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:00,642
Scott: Yes.

407
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:01,610
Scott: I never seen it.

408
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,401
Scott: I know nothing about it other than there is a movie called Escape from an.

409
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:09,498
Rym: you really are lacking in your post-apocalyptic Mad Max kind of movie watching.

410
00:29:09,518 --> 00:29:12,006
Scott: I saw your thing of the day yesterday.

411
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:13,110
Scott: I think that fills my quota.

412
00:29:15,092 --> 00:29:16,830
Scott: That wasn't even in your thing of the day yesterday.

413
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:19,417
Rym: Yeah was no isn't.

414
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,120
Rym: oh that was it.

415
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,625
Rym: That was the kernel that we didn't link to.

416
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:22,890
Scott: no wasn't the kernel.

417
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,885
Rym: It was the yeah, but by the Attata was in the kernel.

418
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:26,448
Scott: Oh, okay.

419
00:29:26,468 --> 00:29:26,750
Scott: You're right.

420
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:28,985
Rym: Well, it was on him and then it was in him.

421
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:39,229
Rym: Yeah Good guy anyway, so uh, and if you can deal with it, then basically don't panic Just think about what your options are.

422
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:42,670
Rym: So, you know, there's the four of us who all work in the city in different places.

423
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:46,019
Rym: We all call each other like alright, here's the situation.

424
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:52,069
Rym: let's mobilize now to avoid the the badness That's about and you had to think about this, right?

425
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,710
Scott: We're in the island of Manhattan, which is the center of civilization or effectively.

426
00:29:57,911 --> 00:29:59,016
Scott: So right it is.

427
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:01,608
Scott: It's as much Center of civilization as there's ever been.

428
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:09,490
Rym: now I don't want to hear any crap from any of you like oh but Paris or Chicago, New York City is still the greatest city in the world.

429
00:30:09,952 --> 00:30:14,448
Scott: Make an argument for say Beijing or something like maybe Hong Kong or Tokyo maybe.

430
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:17,584
Rym: yeah I think Tokyo New York and Hong Kong are at a similar level.

431
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:18,510
Rym: Beijing also.

432
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:22,464
Rym: Yeah, maybe LA has an argument, but not as much.

433
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,130
Rym: New York City is like the center.

434
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:26,557
Scott: Anyway, you know, we're here.

435
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,830
Scott: We have money and we have time.

436
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:39,850
Scott: There's a. there has to be a way for us to get from here to our house Without using the train that is not working now, of course we mobilize immediately.

437
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:46,690
Rym: So Emily and Alex are both like searching online from their job like figuring out different ways and I work across from Grand Central.

438
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:52,410
Rym: So I physically go to Grand Central and start like asking people and looking and trying to figure out what I can do.

439
00:30:52,530 --> 00:31:01,710
Scott: I'm trying to think like well if the trains aren't leaving or coming into Grand Central Can I go to 125th Street on the subway and then get on there?

440
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:06,070
Scott: Can I take the subway to the Bronx and get on the train at Marble Hill?

441
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,690
Rym: Can I take a bus to the Bronx and then get on a train?

442
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,513
Rym: Can I take?

443
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:11,870
Rym: there's a million things and we had to you know?

444
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,064
Rym: Discount all these options and figure it out cuz and you got a kind of.

445
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:16,510
Rym: you got to think rationally.

446
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:22,103
Scott: You gotta take the water taxi to like, you know Sing sing and then get on the train.

447
00:31:22,123 --> 00:31:31,429
Rym: Yeah, so everyone's researching and I go into Grand Central and I'm gonna say this this is why this is a geek fable the majority of the people there.

448
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:35,275
Rym: We're not reacting in a calm Calculated manner.

449
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:54,917
Rym: people were crying people were yelling at police officers people were like trying like standing in line on platforms that they assumed trains would come on and this large crowd was gathering and gathering and gathering and I actually got out of Grand Central because it was getting Extremely crowded and uncomfortable.

450
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:56,663
Scott: I went in I went up the stairs.

451
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:58,529
Scott: They took a picture and then I went out.

452
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:07,564
Scott: Yeah, but pretty much I saw like a pregnant lady like sitting on the ground against the wall like she's like Oh, well gonna wait and I'm like, yep, some why are you waiting?

453
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:08,510
Rym: that like not it?

454
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,072
Rym: Like.

455
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:09,956
Scott: I guess that's a good.

456
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,925
Scott: it's better than what it does other people doing.

457
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:13,030
Scott: but why are you waiting here?

458
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,055
Scott: Why don't you make a move?

459
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:15,664
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

460
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:16,690
Rym: I'm gonna sum this up.

461
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:23,350
Rym: Here's what you need to do whenever disaster strikes like this think react and avoid the crowd.

462
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:26,530
Rym: Any disaster ain't no matter how big or how small?

463
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:32,750
Rym: You really don't want to be where all the other people are like for example that the Grand Central trains are screwed up.

464
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:34,717
Rym: Don't go to Grand Central.

465
00:32:34,757 --> 00:32:36,001
Rym: That's where everyone else is.

466
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:44,690
Scott: if even if the trains start running it's gonna suck You yeah, let's say let's let's assume you go to the crowd and the best possible situation happens.

467
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:51,210
Scott: Right, the best possible situation is this you get on the first train that is going to your house, right?

468
00:32:52,351 --> 00:32:54,056
Scott: You're the first one on that training.

469
00:32:54,076 --> 00:32:58,950
Scott: you get a seat the train is still stupidly crowded and you're packed in like sardines.

470
00:32:59,255 --> 00:33:05,409
Scott: It's hot and nasty It's going really slow and it's making a whole bunch of stops and it's gonna take you forever to get home.

471
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:13,095
Rym: You had to wait in the train station full of an angry mob being subdued by the police for a long time And it was incredibly unpleasant.

472
00:33:13,135 --> 00:33:17,190
Scott: That is the best situation staying at Grand Central in this situation.

473
00:33:17,656 --> 00:33:18,750
Scott: So why would you do that?

474
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,705
Rym: We were looking at different options like all right, we could just stay in the city.

475
00:33:21,886 --> 00:33:22,690
Rym: we could get a hotel.

476
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:24,319
Rym: We all have friends around here.

477
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,270
Scott: We can stay well if I stay in a hotel I can go buy new clothes and take a shower.

478
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:33,750
Rym: We were looking like what if we take the Port Jervis line because there's a station that's not that far from Beacon and then hire?

479
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:43,481
Scott: Well, that's from there, but we could take Jersey transit from Penn Station But that only gets us to the northern part of Jersey and then from there We have to find a way to get back to New York across the Hudson River.

480
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:44,987
Rym: Yes, and not a good.

481
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:45,650
Scott: it doesn't work.

482
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:46,888
Scott: It's not a good plan for us.

483
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:49,554
Rym: Emily and Alex actually Came to the rescue.

484
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,201
Rym: like we're doing all our research and I'm in.

485
00:33:51,421 --> 00:34:00,861
Rym: I fought my way up to the information desk and I asked The Metro North guy and other people I don't get these people who are going up to the MTA Like conductors and yelling at him like you.

486
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:02,046
Rym: better make my train go.

487
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:02,949
Rym: what's going on?

488
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:03,431
Rym: What?

489
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:04,541
Rym: and the guys are like, I don't know.

490
00:34:04,763 --> 00:34:06,213
Rym: don't talk to me I'm stuck.

491
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:09,409
Scott: what you think you're yelling at the guy is gonna solve this big problem.

492
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,476
Scott: But somehow that's gonna help.

493
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:18,489
Rym: as the best part as we're leaving Grand Central The barricade truck was coming up and they actually were setting up queues to kind of keep people in an orderly manner.

494
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:25,893
Scott: Yeah, when I when we left there a whole bunch of police on the corner of you know, like 46 and The 42nd and what that?

495
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:26,737
Scott: what's that Street?

496
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:29,083
Scott: It's not it's that little tiny Street.

497
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:31,938
Rym: Yeah, but it's yeah, you know Those streets don't have names.

498
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,250
Rym: as far as I they're just those streets.

499
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,810
Scott: Yeah, I forget the name a little tiny Street, but they're all standing there getting ready for action.

500
00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:38,047
Scott: So I'm like I'm getting the hell out of here.

501
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:40,255
Rym: Yeah, so basically we're not.

502
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:44,108
Rym: the whole story is after all our research Emily and Alex made the decision.

503
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,051
Rym: and see here's the other thing.

504
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:57,650
Rym: because we worked as a group out we all of us who trusted each other went in different directions trying to figure out What to do and then the first person to come up with a good solution Made a snap decision took care of it and then inform the rest of us to call off our searches.

505
00:34:58,092 --> 00:35:02,810
Rym: Yeah, Emily bought us for Amtrak tickets to Poughkeepsie because Amtrak uses different tracks.

506
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:11,293
Scott: Yeah, well Amtrak uses pretty much the same track except instead of the problem right was at 124th Street The track.

507
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:19,676
Scott: the Amtrak train goes out of Penn Station up the west side of the island and then Onto the same tracks.

508
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:22,570
Scott: we use, you know, usually use well after the problem.

509
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:23,844
Scott: So it debts well.

510
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:26,104
Scott: above that It doesn't meet up with the.

511
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:30,810
Scott: you know Tracks don't merge until you get up to like way north of the Bronx.

512
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,979
Scott: Like maybe is that like?

513
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,866
Scott: I think it's like sputum doival around there.

514
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:35,830
Scott: That's what it's called.

515
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:39,945
Rym: So everyone's they a lot of people are panicking or stock or stock or that.

516
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,517
Rym: and instead, you know We already had we made our decision.

517
00:35:42,537 --> 00:35:43,140
Rym: We had our tickets.

518
00:35:43,784 --> 00:35:48,682
Rym: We went had a nice Chinese Korean fusion dinner a nice leisurely walk.

519
00:35:48,762 --> 00:35:49,424
Scott: take it was only $25.

520
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:52,900
Rym: We went to the store We went to a bookstore.

521
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:53,605
Rym: We chilled.

522
00:35:53,948 --> 00:36:03,150
Rym: Scott Didn't seem to understand how Amtrak worked and got really antsy When there was one minute before the train was supposed to arrive and they didn't say what track it was gonna be.

523
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:04,153
Rym: I yeah, I'm trying.

524
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:05,558
Scott: I don't like that action Scott.

525
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,123
Rym: You got to calm down.

526
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:08,267
Rym: Amtrak's not gonna be.

527
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,134
Rym: you don't need to worry It's no good.

528
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:10,675
Scott: I don't like it.

529
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:14,650
Rym: It's not like they're gonna say the train is on track for go go go.

530
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,741
Scott: Oh my god, that's sort of what they did.

531
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:18,449
Scott: We didn't have long to get on this.

532
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,941
Rym: Besides all the tracks are right there.

533
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:23,830
Scott: Yeah, I still don't like that action.

534
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,509
Rym: Also, you realize Amtrak actually waits for you for a while before they give up.

535
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:32,536
Rym: They'll actually pay like if if someone has a name ticket and they haven't showed up yet They'll page him a couple times.

536
00:36:32,596 --> 00:36:35,670
Scott: They didn't look at my ticket to know my name or anything.

537
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,919
Scott: Well, I think track in any way done that in the past.

538
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:40,430
Rym: They did that a couple times when I took them track to Chicago.

539
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:44,370
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean that's a. that's a much longer kind of trip.

540
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,005
Scott: That's the kind of triple people bring luggage and you're waiting a lot.

541
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:47,890
Scott: You know, this is anyway.

542
00:36:48,051 --> 00:36:50,238
Rym: I think you were overly nervous about the Amtrak.

543
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:51,844
Scott: I don't I don't like the Amtrak.

544
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:52,948
Scott: Anyway, it's good.

545
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:54,674
Rym: It's comfortable It's real comfortable.

546
00:36:54,955 --> 00:37:00,495
Rym: Yeah, so yeah, we took that to any food though, and then on Poughkeepsie I had a dining car.

547
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:02,445
Scott: We pulled that dining car along with us.

548
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:03,370
Scott: We didn't get any food.

549
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,998
Rym: You could have gone down there and bought some.

550
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:05,802
Scott: no fuck that.

551
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:06,385
Rym: I've done.

552
00:37:06,626 --> 00:37:07,370
Rym: I tried to do that.

553
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:09,024
Scott: I should have gotten free food for go.

554
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:09,790
Scott: anyway.

555
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:10,753
Rym: Yeah, so we know.

556
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:16,273
Rym: and the thing is the train was actually kind of full of other people who are smart like us and did The same smart thing.

557
00:37:16,313 --> 00:37:26,390
Rym: Yeah, there were a few smart people a few people going to Albany normally like, you know all kinds Yep, and we get to Poughkeepsie and we check and Metro North doesn't seem to be going back anytime soon.

558
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:30,730
Scott: So I wasn't gonna wait around to see if there was a metro north train going in the reverse direction.

559
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,475
Rym: So we just hire a cab now.

560
00:37:32,956 --> 00:37:36,767
Rym: This is this is probably when we risked our lives the most because that cab driver.

561
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,596
Rym: I Don't know if he could see.

562
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:43,430
Scott: I don't think I don't think he could see cuz he was leaning forward and driving poorly.

563
00:37:43,672 --> 00:37:44,700
Rym: He might have been blind.

564
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,890
Scott: I don't think he was blind.

565
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,036
Scott: I think he just needed to go.

566
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:53,410
Scott: the I man crossed the center line more often than He was hanging well over that center line and he bumped the curb on the right.

567
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:56,761
Rym: They're like four times where I brace myself for impact.

568
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:59,350
Scott: Yeah, not a good try for that guy.

569
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:03,450
Scott: However, yeah, I didn't really think is you're in a relatively big safe vans?

570
00:38:03,771 --> 00:38:11,257
Scott: I wasn't too worried about being injured, but I wasn't confident that he was gonna make it without incident though Yeah, but then we know we got up.

571
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,785
Rym: we realized we actually had a way to make.

572
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:15,090
Scott: you're in a cab and they crash.

573
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:15,987
Scott: Is the ride free?

574
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:21,567
Rym: Actually, I saw a situation where a cabbie was pulled over and the cop was writing him a ticket.

575
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:30,034
Rym: cuz he ran a red light Mm-hmm and the customer opens the door and the cop looks like yeah cuz the door open and the customers like Can I just go?

576
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:31,782
Rym: this is where I wanted to be.

577
00:38:31,862 --> 00:38:33,529
Scott: Anyway, yeah, but you know.

578
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:43,699
Rym: And then the cop said yeah, and then she's like, well do I have to pay the cabbie and the cops like hell no Ah So that's I think the situation.

579
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,410
Scott: who knows what the law says about whether you have to pay the cabbie?

580
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,770
Scott: But regardless that cop that cop wasn't gonna arrest her for it.

581
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,823
Scott: Then basically if there was a law it wasn't going to be enforced.

582
00:38:53,924 --> 00:38:57,196
Rym: if a camera doesn't exist I'm not paying that cabbie.

583
00:38:57,216 --> 00:38:59,785
Rym: In fact, I might be suing that cabbie, but I digress.

584
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:08,090
Rym: Yeah Anyway, so our measure of success we realized on the way home was how many cars are still in the parking lot in beacon?

585
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:24,409
Scott: Yeah, cuz if the parking lot in beacon was still full of cars that meant that either those people who have given up right, those people were staying over the night anyway, or Those people hadn't made it back to beacon yet because you know for whatever reason they're waiting for a train.

586
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:24,790
Scott: who knows?

587
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:27,576
Rym: The parking lot was about half full.

588
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:28,359
Rym: Yeah, it was.

589
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,910
Scott: it was much more full than it usually is at that time of night.

590
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:40,181
Scott: so I think we got back to beacon before a lot of we But before we could have gotten back waiting for trade.

591
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:50,470
Rym: pretty much to have gotten to beacon at about the same time We got via Metro North would have involved the risk of Metro North not starting up again Because they were talking like it was gonna be down all night at first.

592
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,670
Scott: Yeah, we basically there was no information for us to make a decision.

593
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,190
Scott: We didn't know when it was gonna be back up, you know or anything.

594
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,710
Scott: So, you know waiting around for it was that was a big risky move.

595
00:40:01,252 --> 00:40:05,870
Scott: The Amtrak was a sure move and also the Amtrak allowed us time to eat dinner and relax.

596
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:18,050
Rym: Yeah, if we to take Metro North and get back at any reasonable time We would have had to bang in Grand Central that whole time Miserable hungry hot sweaty and bored and taking a big risk on having that been a waste of time.

597
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:24,134
Rym: Yes, I have slept on the streets outside of Grand Central more times in my life than I care to and I do not want To repeat that you mean one.

598
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:28,087
Rym: Yes, that is more times than I planned on in my life.

599
00:40:28,288 --> 00:40:29,813
Rym: when I was a kid I did.

600
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:34,830
Rym: I put the threshold of sleeping on the streets of New York City at zero and I've already breached that threshold.

601
00:40:35,192 --> 00:40:36,317
Rym: I don't want to breach it further.

602
00:40:36,638 --> 00:40:38,909
Scott: We should purposefully go sleep on the streets for fun.

603
00:40:39,473 --> 00:40:41,210
Scott: That was gonna sleep in Lake Central Park.

604
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,650
Rym: I remember that cop was more comfortable and he was like you guys okay, and I was like, yeah waiting for a train.

605
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,652
Rym: He was like, okay He kept going Meanwhile it.

606
00:40:47,873 --> 00:40:52,510
Scott: then in the morning when it was actually time for trains we go in and we see that all these other people were inside.

607
00:40:52,671 --> 00:40:53,757
Rym: Well, they were just in the front.

608
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:55,044
Rym: There's like one cop watching him.

609
00:40:55,326 --> 00:40:59,570
Rym: Yeah Oh, well that didn't look any more comfortable or safe to be honest.

610
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,503
Scott: No, we should have gone to like Central Park and slept in the grass been more comfortable.

611
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:09,703
Rym: Yes alone in Central Park Asleep is much safer than next to police officers.

612
00:41:09,824 --> 00:41:11,550
Rym: at a well-lit populated area.

613
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,689
Scott: You could go where there's a light and a bench and a cop in the park.

614
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:16,295
Rym: Yeah, you do that.

615
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:19,069
Scott: The bench is more comfortable than the sidewalk at least.

616
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:22,359
Rym: Anyway, the moral not gonna do the wheel of morality.

617
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:22,660
Rym: Whatever.

618
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,423
Rym: It's pretty simple.

619
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:24,947
Scott: It turns it turns.

620
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:25,810
Rym: don't panic.

621
00:41:26,352 --> 00:41:29,410
Rym: And if I don't panic, I mean don't lose your shit when things go bad.

622
00:41:29,911 --> 00:41:34,605
Rym: Think react and stay away from crowds and everything will turn out.

623
00:41:34,685 --> 00:41:35,166
Rym: Okay.

624
00:41:35,648 --> 00:41:35,888
Scott: Yep.

625
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:39,990
Rym: Also Sadly money can pretty much solve any problem.

626
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:41,094
Scott: Yeah, that's it.

627
00:41:41,134 --> 00:41:41,896
Scott: That's another thing.

628
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:56,543
Scott: if you want to be like Penn Jillette because this is something he often espouses is don't go anywhere or put yourself in any situation where money can't save your ass and I always have enough money to save your ass no matter what happens.

629
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:56,965
Rym: Yeah.

630
00:41:57,025 --> 00:41:57,588
Rym: No, that's not.

631
00:41:57,608 --> 00:42:00,371
Rym: I mean I don't stand by that 100%.

632
00:42:00,371 --> 00:42:06,570
Rym: That is the advice of a person who is a libertarian solely because he is wealthy enough to afford everything you could ever want.

633
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,395
Scott: Yeah, he's that's the advice.

634
00:42:08,455 --> 00:42:10,542
Rym: Why don't people just buy their own police?

635
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:11,204
Rym: Haha.

636
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,190
Rym: I could afford it you can too.

637
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:17,150
Scott: That's that's the advice of a rich and famous person with a mansion in Vegas.

638
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:22,530
Rym: Yeah, it's easy to be a libertarian with an uppercase L. If you're incredibly wealthy you have your own compound.

639
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:23,711
Scott: Great.

640
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:24,533
