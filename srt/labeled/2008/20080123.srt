1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,764
Rym: It's Wednesday January 23rd, and this is GeekNights tonight.

2
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,550
Rym: We review the for immigrants manga.

3
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,107
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:29,003
Rym: Well, we were almost gonna go to a con this weekend almost.

5
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,030
Scott: maybe this is tiny tiny chance.

6
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:31,492
Scott: We'll go.

7
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:33,441
Rym: I think the chance is zero.

8
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:35,410
Rym: I'm already planning on going skiing this weekend.

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,541
Scott: I'm also planning on working on stuff instead of going.

10
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:40,910
Scott: but yeah this we still a tiny chance as we don't go.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:48,738
Rym: I mean we haven't been to gaming cons a lot ever since uber con moved an hour further south and didn't have Luke crane and it's like wow, there's no reason to go now.

12
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:49,320
Scott: Yeah.

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,750
Rym: Yeah, so oh, there's this gaming con dreamation this weekend.

14
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:53,677
Rym: Hey screw it.

15
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:54,020
Rym: Let's go.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,241
Rym: Luke.

17
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,027
Scott: Crane's gonna be there.

18
00:00:55,048 --> 00:01:06,110
Rym: and Yeah, then we realized Oh Luke cranes events according to I think the con chair whoever was who emailed us back filled up within quote minutes of the schedule going online.

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,483
Scott: Yeah, I guess he's a hit right and he'd be such a hit Making more money.

20
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:13,070
Scott: think about this.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:21,302
Rym: We were about to go to a con and sign up to do multiple events run by one guy With whom we have gone to multiple events in the past.

22
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,396
Rym: I can imagine us getting there him saying you guys again What the fuck?

23
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:26,009
Rym: Let me choke burning wheel to someone else.

24
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,712
Scott: I mean in a hit.

25
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:29,301
Scott: already know it exists in the history of role-playing.

26
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:31,870
Scott: have there ever been like rock star dungeon masters?

27
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,016
Scott: And like he is?

28
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:36,233
Rym: I mean, I think the closest thing is Theoretical.

29
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:40,470
Rym: I mean in terms of famousness or awesomeness you could look at like Gary guy guy.

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,530
Rym: But I mean when Gary guy gags when was the last time he ran a campaign for anyone?

31
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:57,176
Scott: Yeah, I mean seriously I guess I guess if he ran a thing at a convention like ran a game for people that people would sign up like crazy But mostly for his name, you know people Luke crane isn't a famous name.

32
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:59,624
Scott: people are signing up because his games are actually awesome.

33
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:01,390
Rym: Luke crane should be a famous name.

34
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,574
Scott: However, god damn it's like, you know, I don't know I'm not really.

35
00:02:04,594 --> 00:02:07,610
Scott: I'm saying we're people who aren't deep into that circle.

36
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:13,450
Scott: I mean, I'm sure people who are deeper into the gaming cons recognize other names of people running games and sign up.

37
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,415
Scott: You know based on that.

38
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:23,254
Scott: but to think that someone you know Has a name and you just you sign up for a game based on the name alone and you're not a gaming con person That's pretty big.

39
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:24,018
Rym: It's funny.

40
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:26,170
Rym: Otherwise and other people seem to do the same thing.

41
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,199
Rym: They look and if there's a burning wheel event does not excite them.

42
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:32,750
Rym: It only excites them if they see run by Luke crane.

43
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:36,250
Scott: Well, actually, I think some of the other burning wheel events did fill up also.

44
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:42,194
Rym: Oh, of course they did but I wonder how many of those people didn't realize that while it's probably gonna be awesome It's not Luke himself.

45
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:44,202
Rym: Yeah, or maybe it is, you know that guy.

46
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:51,056
Rym: he'd probably run two burning wheels simultaneously Just in two different rooms, but also There was some other either.

47
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:53,607
Scott: they said they were they were gonna talk to him about.

48
00:02:53,687 --> 00:03:02,890
Scott: you know Dexcon Which is the con I was planning on going to which is run by the same people in July That they're gonna try to get Luke to bring more DMS to run more burning wheels.

49
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:06,043
Rym: I'd say we could do it, but I'm not ready for that.

50
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,249
Scott: No, no, not at all.

51
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:10,650
Scott: I would be people who signed up for my game would be quite disappointed.

52
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,550
Rym: But speaking of cons, I'm not gonna go and talk about this forever.

53
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:20,690
Rym: But I have to point out that in February There's a convention called Katsucon pretty much one of my favorite guns everywhere.

54
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,350
Rym: What if everywhere the point is we are running a whole crazy ton of events there?

55
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,959
Rym: We're gonna be in the video game room though.

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,830
Rym: Every time we're not running crazy events.

57
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:35,123
Rym: I highly recommend if you're a fan of GeekNights and a fan of anime that you go to Katsucon.

58
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:38,151
Scott: It's February 15 16 17.

59
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:45,970
Scott: So not this weekend not the weekend after that not the weekend after that But the weekend after that.

60
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:48,316
Rym: Now there has been a schedule change.

61
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:51,564
Rym: We're only running six events instead of seven.

62
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,770
Scott: Oh, no six events.

63
00:03:55,036 --> 00:04:07,687
Rym: I think they highlighting event is going to be the Late show Katsu late night Katsucon Friday night from 1030 to 1 a.m Why oh, so so wait, let me see what the description of that event is in the con book.

64
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,417
Scott: It says right here Oh, um watch Scott sleep.

65
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:10,998
Rym: Yeah.

66
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,644
Scott: No, that's a wonderful event.

67
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:14,450
Rym: I thought you said you had a monologue written.

68
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,762
Rym: Shit great good game.

69
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:18,988
Scott: I got like four weeks, right?

70
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:20,997
Rym: Yeah, we'll see how that goes.

71
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:34,350
Rym: yeah anyway in actual anime news up a while ago we talked about a show that we were really excited about because of the trailer and then we watched the show and it was an okay show but It was not quite what I expected.

72
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:47,630
Rym: well that show was picked up and now it is going to be available and in fact on February 19th the first DVD of Moonlight Mile is going to be coming out in the US for you to see in English.

73
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,959
Scott: Didn't we do a GeekNights about?

74
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,530
Scott: we did a GeekNights about Moonlight Mile.

75
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,760
Rym: we did but I think we have a lot of new listeners since then.

76
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:02,269
Rym: and also I want to remind you it's out if you think a show about men striving to become astronauts and beef and friendship and camaraderie and all that business in space.

77
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,700
Rym: and Independently of that you really want to see a bunch of Sherpas have an orgy.

78
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,364
Rym: The show is for you.

79
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:12,710
Scott: Yeah, I guess two female Sherpas.

80
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:22,679
Rym: Well, then there was the guys there and then there's that other random sex scene in episode 2 and then I think there's a random Sex scene in at least one per episode for the rest of the show.

81
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,350
Scott: I've seen the manga for it in various Japanese bookstores.

82
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,310
Scott: I'm wondering how close the manga is to the a nine.

83
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:35,545
Rym: well, it is gonna be on a Anime networks video on demand and the end of the end of this month.

84
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,510
Scott: So, huh?

85
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,010
Scott: Oh, I guess they gotta put something on that anime network, right?

86
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,838
Scott: They pretty much put every a TV show on there.

87
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,486
Scott: Anyway, so yeah and a TV.

88
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:43,069
Rym: pick this up.

89
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,513
Scott: So Is that I got?

90
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:46,236
Rym: that's all I got.

91
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,002
Scott: Okay, so there's no anime news.

92
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:49,065
Rym: There's nothing to talk about.

93
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:50,069
Scott: There's no anime news.

94
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:57,856
Scott: That's why you fight geek bite is you're gonna have her a lot of geek bites on Wednesday because a lot of Comics and things that I read.

95
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:00,064
Scott: and why an anime that I watch that Rym doesn't.

96
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:04,410
Scott: and this is a way to sort of get Them out to you without waiting until we can do a full show on them.

97
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,666
Scott: So I'm actually gonna tell you about something mad old gonna talk to you about Galaxy Express 3 9 TV show.

98
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:17,983
Scott: now Way back in the high school days like 98 99 right before I was big into the a-nines.

99
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:19,970
Scott: I gotta stop saying a-nines.

100
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:25,104
Scott: I was watching the sci-fi channel and there was like a week of anime and that's.

101
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:28,656
Scott: that was like sort of like the tipping point In the anime fandom of myself.

102
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:29,519
Rym: Wow for me.

103
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:30,622
Rym: It was in fourth grade.

104
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:35,776
Rym: Yeah on the sci-fi network fan Ain't mad.

105
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:38,353
Scott: after project a okay It's like a little slope.

106
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:45,681
Scott: and then that we get that week of anime was like the the peak and then it just sort of Was downhill like whoosh from there into the anime club, right?

107
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:56,581
Scott: But one of the things they showed was the Galaxy Express 3 9 movie and then the second Galaxy Express 3 9 movie and More than any other other movies that I saw that week.

108
00:06:56,682 --> 00:07:00,413
Scott: Those were the ones that were like, oh man is There's.

109
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:08,829
Scott: there's not much get that gets better for me in anime than watching some outer space Opera, Leiji Matsumoto late at night in the dark.

110
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:15,430
Rym: Hello, I recall I think I watched like earth say Otsu or two and then I fell asleep before three nines.

111
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,690
Scott: Yeah, that one works though for late night dark aloneness.

112
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,155
Scott: That's a good sort.

113
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:22,222
Scott: semi space opera ish kind of anime is it?

114
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:24,350
Scott: is that kind of late night mood, you know?

115
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,108
Scott: but anyway, so I had watched the movies.

116
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:47,650
Scott: and You know If you don't realize the first Galaxy Express 3 9 movie is a compilation movie that sort of summarizes the TV show And you know what more than any compilation movie I've ever seen it Summarizes the TV show up damn Well, like it is a substitute for the TV show if you do not want to watch a hundred and thirteen TV episodes.

117
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:55,064
Scott: but the hundred and thirteen TV TV episodes Surprisingly are not like, you know bad.

118
00:07:55,104 --> 00:08:01,010
Scott: It's not like they cut out bad stuff It's just that the TV show is not monster of the week.

119
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:02,589
Scott: It's more like planet of the week.

120
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:09,202
Scott: you know every every week the train stops at a different planet and they get out and they do something and then they get back on the train, you know.

121
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:13,457
Scott: and Thing is slowly over time throughout the series.

122
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:19,819
Scott: They reveal more and more things about the main plot, you know, like oh my tell is all mysterious.

123
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:22,152
Scott: and oh Where did they?

124
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:27,890
Scott: you know that gun belong to someone who to belong to or there's a train in space.

125
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:29,759
Scott: Where is it gonna go?

126
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,070
Scott: Yeah, the thing is from watching the TV show.

127
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:38,770
Scott: I think even though the compilation movie is still fantastic and that's something everyone should see the TV show is also fantastic.

128
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,513
Scott: I mean a lot of these.

129
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:45,777
Scott: some of the planets of the week are kind of weird like there's one where they get off a Planet where these amorphous blobs live.

130
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:47,784
Scott: Yeah, that that episode was not so good.

131
00:08:47,864 --> 00:08:49,450
Rym: But hey nothing wrong with a movie.

132
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,594
Rym: How dare you discriminate?

133
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:51,418
Scott: They weren't movies.

134
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,241
Scott: They were not good.

135
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:53,265
Rym: No movie games.

136
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,993
Scott: No, no movie games Right now.

137
00:08:55,455 --> 00:09:06,740
Scott: but something that what I like about the show is that first of all You get to see a lot more of the universe like you're seeing these like non 3-9 trains and all this other stuff going on that you don't get to see so much in the movie.

138
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,670
Scott: and Also each episode sometimes is a multi-part story.

139
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:21,495
Scott: but you know each I guess story within the TV show has a really good like sci-fi kind of message to it and it's like Granted the message of all.

140
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:33,690
Rym: pretty much every one of these works always seems to come down to something along the lines of ah Gave up my humanity, but for what I sure hope I don't give up your humanity.

141
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,457
Scott: Actually, a lot of them aren't about humanity.

142
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:42,837
Scott: There's some about environment stuff and some about family and some about you know Being poverty.

143
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:46,352
Rym: Oh, yeah, but you cannot deny that a lot of them involve Man.

144
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,137
Rym: someone gave up their humanity.

145
00:09:48,257 --> 00:09:57,210
Scott: the main workout for the main theme of the show is you know good Turning yourself into changing your regular body for a machine body.

146
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,490
Scott: Do you see some people regretting it and some people enjoying it and some people liking it?

147
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,677
Scott: but then being assholes and you know They show it they pretty much show you all sides.

148
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:19,521
Scott: and unlike the movie which is sort of just like machine bodies bad The TV show sort of really mixes it up over time and any one of these episodes make would make a real pretty decent Short sci-fi story on its own.

149
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:21,570
Rym: I can give you all the one warning.

150
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,762
Rym: It's not really a warning because I love this stuff.

151
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:32,150
Rym: I eat it up, but I will say Be prepared anytime you watch any leji Matsumoto work for not drama, but melodrama.

152
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:36,639
Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's.

153
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,930
Scott: uh, there's people fan subbing it right now.

154
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,448
Scott: They just put out episode 24 today, and I'm gonna watch all this fair.

155
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:51,490
Scott: Watch out I'm watching every single episode and I Really like that closing song - it reminds me a lot of those old show closing songs like the Macross closing.

156
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,560
Rym: So I like all that old kind of anime opener closer music.

157
00:10:54,741 --> 00:11:00,285
Scott: Yeah, and the opening song is like, you know a Japanese guy going You know one of those.

158
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:02,853
Scott: I Like this action.

159
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:03,695
Scott: It's good action.

160
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:07,950
Scott: If you're if you're not downloading the fan subs, maybe you should you're not gonna ever.

161
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,047
Scott: It's never gonna be on DVD.

162
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:16,912
Scott: Well, who's gonna be able to sell a hundred and thirteen episodes of a show from like 1979?

163
00:11:16,912 --> 00:11:19,382
Rym: Well, I was older than I am someday.

164
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:21,390
Rym: It'll be in the public domain.

165
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:35,724
Rym: Yeah after I die Things of the day So everyone gets one.

166
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:43,787
Rym: I mean Scott and I have our initial D and Some one of our friends watches bleach, you know, everyone has their one like shonen fighting kind of.

167
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:48,584
Rym: oh my god is he gonna do the thing for episode long battle between two people kind of show.

168
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:53,296
Rym: everyone gets one that they really like and Emily has recently found hers.

169
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:57,167
Rym: It's this baseball show and it's just crazy the pitcher catcher.

170
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:58,070
Rym: Something's gonna happen.

171
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,410
Scott: Oh my god drama, but I just wanted to watch a baseball anime, but it's hard to get them because they're not in English.

172
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:06,639
Rym: Well, this one's being fansubbed.

173
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,229
Scott: no really, I believe it's a cold I don't even remember.

174
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:11,528
Rym: Yeah, you can partly because I'm in Windows.

175
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:16,590
Rym: now I'm using my fancy cool edit Pro instead of any sort of crap program in Linux.

176
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,748
Rym: but the problem is Windows not so great and Windows not used so often.

177
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:22,956
Rym: so Japanese no worky.

178
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,961
Rym: a lot of question marks here.

179
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:32,048
Rym: All right, but uh, you know in America We have fan art and fan works, but they always take that kind of to the next level.

180
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:36,817
Scott: in Japan Yeah, the cosplay is way better than ours Daikon animation.

181
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:38,647
Scott: Yeah, we lose they rule.

182
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:51,316
Rym: Yeah, but one one thing that is done in Japan and this is being done more and more partly just because technology is making it Easier, but at the same time this is the kind of thing where you look and say wow I think I'll just draw fan art.

183
00:12:51,818 --> 00:13:05,429
Rym: people take you might have seen these before the opener to a show and Then they take characters from another show and they fully Reanimate the opener to the first show with the characters and the inside jokes from the second show.

184
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:07,995
Rym: Now granted this is not.

185
00:13:08,116 --> 00:13:19,310
Rym: I was very very impressed by this until Emily pointed out that most of these people either Rotoscope or trace or just like over right overdo it with keyframes and just figure and just reanimate exactly change the heads.

186
00:13:19,411 --> 00:13:23,689
Rym: Yeah, flash helps a lot But at the same time that's still quite a bit of work.

187
00:13:24,132 --> 00:13:27,490
Scott: It is a lot more work than making an AMV where you just copying cutting and pasting.

188
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:32,430
Rym: But of all of these this part of the high one of the highest quality ones and it is to that baseball show.

189
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,581
Rym: It is the opener to asa manga.

190
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:36,009
Rym: daioh, but it is that show.

191
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:39,438
Rym: It's pretty high quality is pretty high.

192
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,626
Scott: But the entertainment value for me was not so high.

193
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:42,749
Rym: You didn't even watch it.

194
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:43,793
Scott: I watched part of it.

195
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:47,650
Rym: You watch two seconds of it before I opened up another window to look something up.

196
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:50,442
Scott: No, I watched it before Emily sent it to me the other day.

197
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,080
Rym: Oh, well, you're just a cold-hearted bass I was like 10 15 seconds of.

198
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:58,090
Scott: Then I said I basically said oh I get the joke, okay, I'm done.

199
00:13:58,511 --> 00:13:59,314
Rym: I think it's really funny.

200
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:08,444
Rym: and also if you're looking for a crazy initial d-style baseball show Whatever the show is called question mark question mark question mark plus question mark.

201
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:11,777
Scott: Ooh, it sounds like good show to me All right.

202
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:12,485
Scott: So check this out.

203
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,256
Scott: You know Totoro, right?

204
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,299
Rym: I do.

205
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,803
Scott: we should do a show on Totoro probably.

206
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,910
Scott: Maybe you have to watch Totoro again.

207
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:20,476
Scott: Okay a long time.

208
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:23,124
Scott: you know that.

209
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:29,509
Scott: the Picture that always you always see if Totoro at the bus stop with the umbrella and the girl hiding under it whatever, right?

210
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,064
Scott: Some guy who lives in?

211
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:32,890
Scott: I don't know.

212
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,750
Scott: I guess this is Nagasaki because it says on the top of the web page web news the Nagasaki shimbun HP.

213
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:46,305
Scott: I can't read anything else on the side obviously because it's in moon language but there's a picture of a guy of not the guy.

214
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:59,270
Scott: but apparently a Guy made a Totoro statue with an umbrella and put it at the bus stop in his town and it looks just like The bus stop in Totoro, so if it's raining you can go to the bus stop and stand under the Totoro's umbrella.

215
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,080
Rym: Did he do this with permission?

216
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:01,985
Rym: Was it a commission?

217
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:02,770
Rym: Did he just do it?

218
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,390
Scott: I think he just did it like because he wanted to out of like niceness like a bored old retired man or something?

219
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:08,812
Scott: I don't know.

220
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:12,930
Scott: It's not enough details in English for me to tell you but it's cool nonetheless.

221
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:15,223
Scott: And there's a picture which is enough to make a thing of the day.

222
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:18,922
Rym: So tonight To get right along with the main bit here.

223
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,570
Rym: We're gonna talk about something.

224
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,547
Rym: I guess you should all put on your erudite hat your highbrow hats.

225
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:34,050
Scott: Yes Yes, we're not gonna talk with fake British accent, I mean we should put in our beanies cuz we're so such intellectual artistes.

226
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:36,378
Rym: I believe you mean berets.

227
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,824
Rym: All right beanies.

228
00:15:37,844 --> 00:15:38,990
Rym: the exact opposite.

229
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:45,350
Scott: In my brain was a picture of a beret but out of my mouth came the word beanie.

230
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:53,130
Rym: In fact, I would say if ever there were two hats that were diametrically opposed in the most extreme way possible It would be the beret and the beanie.

231
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:53,908
Scott: I don't think so.

232
00:15:54,252 --> 00:16:03,073
Rym: I would think we could have a three-way of The beret on the top and then down at the bottom left of the triangle is the beanie and the bottom right is the German Spike helmet.

233
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:07,450
Scott: Well, I was thinking the spike helmet would definitely be in one part of the triangle and the beanie and the other.

234
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:14,930
Scott: But I think that the beret would actually be somewhere between on the line between the beanie and the top hat.

235
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,916
Rym: No, because the top hat is class without pretension I don't know.

236
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:24,150
Rym: the beret you can't get away with unless you are a percussionist or you are in France.

237
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,917
Scott: Well, then where do you place the bowler hat?

238
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:28,788
Rym: The bowler hat is classy classier than the top hat.

239
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:33,725
Scott: I say Anyway, let's talk about the the intellectual business.

240
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:34,730
Rym: It's no puppy helmet.

241
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:41,007
Rym: No, so we're gonna talk about tonight something kind of amazing something kind of interesting.

242
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:41,910
Rym: It's not the.

243
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:45,482
Rym: It's not like this great entertaining thing to read.

244
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:49,680
Rym: it's more of a historical document It's the kind of thing you would read for a class.

245
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:50,243
Scott: Yes, it's.

246
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,750
Scott: it's sort of like that.

247
00:16:52,732 --> 00:17:08,609
Scott: It's a book where the the contents of the book itself, right are only fascinating from a meta perspective Sort of like, you know The the fact of what it is is more important than the actuality of what it is when you read it the content.

248
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:21,440
Rym: So tonight we're going to talk about the the for immigrants manga which was written by a man named Henry kiyama in San Francisco and it chronicles the experience of Japanese immigrants.

249
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:33,243
Rym: the United States from give or take 1904 to 1924 so turn of the century, you know late Industrial Revolution Like this is World Fair Times.

250
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:40,064
Scott: Yeah, and basically Way back in the early 20th century this Japanese guy comes to the u.s.

251
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:46,839
Scott: He immigrates here to San Francisco and While he's here He sort of draws manga of his experiences.

252
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,608
Scott: and the manga isn't sort of part English part Japanese that you know no one could really understand except for people who are in his situation.

253
00:17:54,709 --> 00:18:02,290
Scott: and You know, what happened was Frederick Schott who's like he's one of those epic kind of anime manga guy.

254
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:13,911
Scott: He's pretty much like the the foremost Academic authority on animes and mangas at least the foremost English academic authority on animes and mangas and Tezuka and all that kind of Stuff.

255
00:18:13,931 --> 00:18:14,837
Scott: that's like what he does.

256
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:16,407
Scott: He's like a professor of that.

257
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:23,390
Scott: basically I'm sure the Wikipedia page about the guy he spoke to the RIT anime club once before we got there long before he got there.

258
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:30,148
Rym: Yeah, in fact in the anime club library unless the club stupidly got rid of him to this day There are several VHS tapes of his lectures.

259
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:35,290
Rym: Yep Oh, wow, Fred Schoen has like the tiniest little Wikipedia page ever that needs some beefing up right there.

260
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:36,970
Scott: Yeah, he's written a bunch of books.

261
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:47,389
Scott: so if you're really interested in you know learning a lot about the history of anime and manga and all sorts of Intellectualisms around it that his books are the ones to read pretty much right away.

262
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:58,930
Scott: But anyway, he was you know digging around doing his research and in some library He found like like a card like a card in the in the index, you know in the card catalog.

263
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:05,643
Rym: Right that thing that we don't use anymore, you know, I'm not Physically touched a card catalog since I was in elementary school.

264
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:10,382
Scott: I touched one In high school and even then in elementary school.

265
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:11,427
Rym: There was a computer.

266
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:20,043
Scott: Yep I used one in high school because the town library had gotten you know some like, you know VT 100s hooked up to some kind of system that had a thing right.

267
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:21,891
Scott: you could also dial into it from home Which is cool.

268
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,377
Rym: Well, you know, I realized something sadder.

269
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:28,573
Rym: I haven't been inside of a library since I was a college student Yeah, me either.

270
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:35,070
Rym: and even then the only time I ever went to that library was to take a nap or once to get a Book that I couldn't find online

271
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:43,129
Scott: If I wasn't buying the comics on the cheap from the the discount place I would be going to the library to like, you know, take them out and then bring them back for free.

272
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:47,750
Scott: But anyway, so he was digging around once doing research.

273
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,920
Scott: I'm not gonna go into too much detail on this because it's in the introduction to the book Which I suggest you read because it's the.

274
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:54,530
Scott: I think it's the most, you know, three.

275
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:58,509
Rym: I know a lot of people skip that sort of thing when they were, you know That's really the most important part of this book.

276
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:03,210
Rym: I like the people who read Watchmen and then they skip all those words in between the pictures.

277
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,375
Scott: You mean the most important parts?

278
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:05,299
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

279
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:08,010
Scott: Yeah, or at least, you know, just as important as the rest of the parts.

280
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:11,683
Scott: There's some people who read Watchmen to skip the pirate parts, but the pirate.

281
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:13,590
Rym: Ah, yeah, we've talked about that.

282
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:31,862
Scott: Anyway, so it talks about how Frederic show discovered this manga written by Henry kiyama You know when he was, you know, chronicling his his life as a Japanese immigrant in the US in the early 20th century Industrial Revolution Roaring to early roaring 20s kind of times and

283
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:36,501
Rym: also during the kind of Ascendance of Japan to the world stage.

284
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:49,166
Rym: I mean, this is right around the the The Russian Japanese war which was basically two Semi-western powers fighting to show who was more Western and apparently Western men have a big ol wall.

285
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:55,794
Scott: Whoa, but basically It's the story of this guy and he's a pretty smart Intellectual guy.

286
00:20:55,814 --> 00:21:12,555
Scott: but because he's you know, Japanese in America, you know, he's ends up working, you know Like normal kind of the same kind of jobs that would I guess Stereotypically be given to like, you know illegal sort of immigrants from Mexico nowadays, you know working in a kitchen Cleaning up someone's house.

287
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:14,521
Scott: that that's the sort of thing he was doing in those days.

288
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:17,670
Rym: Yeah, the comic itself is is semi-autobiographical.

289
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:24,076
Rym: It basically follows these four different Japanese immigrants to the US and they both take four somewhat different paths.

290
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:33,330
Rym: one of them ends up gambling a lot and one of them's an art student and One of them's kind of the main guy and it just it follows them through these short kind of sketches.

291
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:36,010
Rym: I mean, there's not really any one overarching story.

292
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:46,670
Rym: There's just a whole bunch of short bits about different aspects of life in the in the 19 aughts and the 1920s as a Japanese immigrant in San Francisco.

293
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:59,270
Scott: Yep, the first part of it I think is is sort of funnier but also really sad and that it mostly shows them trying to get Jobs, you know struggling to get a job in someone's house and then screwing up at the job and being told to go home.

294
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:03,785
Scott: And they keep you know, it's funny cuz it's like don't get told go home go home.

295
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:13,101
Rym: Oh, I got told go home Not again, I think what's most fascinating though is and Scott mentioned this at the beginning that this is written bilingually and and showed even talks about how.

296
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:17,663
Rym: that's probably why this Comic basically failed when it was first published.

297
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,390
Scott: was really it was published really?

298
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,341
Scott: I mean, what did he say about how it was published?

299
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,950
Scott: It could have been that many copies of it, right?

300
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,672
Rym: Well, there was that.

301
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:28,730
Rym: the real trouble was that there was no market for something like this because it was written bilingually.

302
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:36,721
Rym: It was written in English and in Japanese and it kind of mixes between the two and if a character would say something In English, they said it in English.

303
00:22:36,741 --> 00:22:38,090
Rym: Yeah something Japanese.

304
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,980
Rym: They said it in Japanese and it's interesting looking at how.

305
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:54,148
Rym: he'd obviously be new enough English to get by but he wasn't Super well versed in English and as you definitely see that in his English writing and at the same time He actually makes according to Fred a lot of mistakes in the Japanese writing -

306
00:22:54,449 --> 00:23:00,390
Scott: yeah Well, I mean, you know, he's not like, you know, I mean we make mistakes and you write in English And that's our first language.

307
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,910
Scott: So, of course a Japanese speaker who's not doesn't have an editor and a proofreader is gonna make mistakes.

308
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:18,881
Scott: You may make mistakes Okay You know without an editing and a proofreading there's gonna be mistakes even in your first language, but you know, I think that I Think show it made a really good decision when he was translating.

309
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:21,330
Scott: it is anything that was originally written in English.

310
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,474
Scott: He left it as is.

311
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:25,185
Scott: you can see the original lettering.

312
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,816
Scott: that was done by hand But all the Japanese.

313
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:30,610
Scott: he sort of erased it and then typed in the English.

314
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:33,810
Scott: But he tried not to like, you know, like ruin the bubbles or anything.

315
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:40,510
Scott: So a lot of times like it's hard to read it because you know He's more about preserving the history than preserving the content.

316
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,822
Scott: I think that's the right way to go with this book.

317
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:44,853
Rym: Don't think of this as a comic You're just gonna read.

318
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:47,524
Rym: think of it as kind of a a primary historical source.

319
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,215
Scott: Yeah, pretty much Yeah, it's exactly what it is.

320
00:23:51,837 --> 00:23:55,290
Scott: Anyway, so what were your favorite parts in this thing here?

321
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:00,038
Rym: Oh, you want to get right to that because he ran out of anything intellectual or insightful to say.

322
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:07,887
Scott: I think a lot of the things intellectual to say about it are You know sort of like said in the introduction, you know, and it's like what I don't know.

323
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:10,014
Rym: one thing I can say I just I love reading.

324
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:13,790
Rym: any sort of piece written can fight to contemporaries to the air.

325
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:21,703
Rym: I mean That's why I'm reading a lot of Roman and Greek histories now and I was reading this old Japanese poet who wrote about how he used to do the same thing.

326
00:24:21,763 --> 00:24:22,587
Rym: I love that sort of thing.

327
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:26,056
Rym: It gives her really Interesting if somewhat biased perspective, but

328
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:37,550
Scott: one thing that I remember is actually really interesting about this is that it's done Every page is like six panels right one two three four five six So like two across and three down and they're all the same size.

329
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:54,630
Scott: So he wasn't really experimenting with the paneling that much, you know, it wasn't really that kind of thing but it's left to right and it was originally left to right and According to show it apparently, you know, cuz the the mangas of the time, you know People are copying the American comics and whatnot.

330
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,528
Scott: they did it left to right even though their language rent from right to left.

331
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:01,606
Scott: and You can see a lot of the panels are they're numbered.

332
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:08,480
Scott: he writes, you know He puts it in the bottom right corner the number one two three four five six so that people know which order to read them in.

333
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:16,029
Scott: and I thought that was pretty interesting right there because you know, of course now we have all these mangas that are right to left and we're like, no, don't flip them don't flip them.

334
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:25,569
Scott: and Originally, you know the the the manga people weren't even flipping American comics to read right to left They were writing their own comics left to right to match us.

335
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:27,614
Rym: I think actually the.

336
00:25:27,715 --> 00:25:36,890
Rym: but it was said best in terms of what you'll get out of this by will Eisner of all people Kiyamas the for immigrants manga is a treasure like the yellow click kid and jigs and Maggie.

337
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,779
Rym: I actually don't know what jigs and Maggie is.

338
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,225
Scott: I don't know one of those old come.

339
00:25:40,266 --> 00:25:41,130
Rym: Yeah, I know the yellow kid.

340
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:42,595
Rym: Yeah, I know what it is.

341
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:47,422
Rym: I read one of them in a social studies book once in middle school Mm-hmm.

342
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:58,505
Rym: It is a splendid and authentic example of the immigrant literature of the period more candid and outspoken than any of its Contemporaries is a classic that demonstrates the true literary role of the comics to reflect ordinary life.

343
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:01,832
Rym: Moreover is a fun read Mm-hmm.

344
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:03,938
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much nails it.

345
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:04,299
Scott: Yeah,

346
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:22,664
Rym: the thing is it it does especially later deals with very serious very depressing very just kind of Bad issues, but it it deals with them in such light like when he one of the characters decides All right I'm gonna go fight in the war and come back and get my citizenship and he goes.

347
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:26,173
Rym: he fights in the war and it's a very kind of comic couple.

348
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:33,859
Rym: a panel of I fought in the war and he gets back and now he tries to get his citizenship and they're like No, and he's like, ah all that work for nothing.

349
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:43,510
Scott: But if you think about what actually happened there It's sort of disturbing in a way that the whole thing feels kind of light-hearted because of the way the comic is done.

350
00:26:44,012 --> 00:26:47,510
Scott: But some of the subject matter is really heavy.

351
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:55,910
Rym: It's like oh god You know like like the one guy who was up his face was deformed in an accident while he was working on the farm And now he's trying to get a bride.

352
00:26:56,091 --> 00:27:12,489
Rym: so he takes a picture to hide his deformity and then he gets a picture ride from Japan and then he puts a plaster over half his face to try to hide it until the wedding happens and then the plaster falls off and and And all hell breaks loose and that that's one of the stories and it kind of ends on that note.

353
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:29,676
Scott: Yeah, it's but it's the way that he treats that, you know serious material is very Light and it's sort of like uh, I guess it's sort of it helps though because if he dealt with it Seriously, it would be sort of difficult to read this thing without getting really depressed Really quickly.

354
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:32,507
Scott: You'd be like, oh god life was so terrible.

355
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,217
Scott: God damn But maybe that's just.

356
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:37,328
Scott: you know, the way the guy was, you know, he sort of.

357
00:27:37,348 --> 00:27:41,750
Scott: you know He lived in a horrible kind of situation at least it from our perspective.

358
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:47,193
Scott: But maybe you know, that was his attitude is that he was sort of a light-hearted kind of guy And he's well.

359
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:54,390
Rym: actually from what I remember reading in the intro He talked about how he wasn't a light-hearted guy now other people were and how he wanted to reflect that in some of the characters.

360
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,519
Scott: Yeah, all right.

361
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:09,388
Scott: That sounds good to me But yeah, it's I think the most thing the most important thing out of this manga is not the manga itself You know, which isn't you know, it's not like the greatest manga of all time or anything but it's historical significance and the context of it.

362
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:25,050
Scott: and You know you get to see an account of the history of the time, you know from someone who was living it Uncensored and full-on, you know, I mean he talks about the San Francisco earthquake and all sorts of the world's fair when it comes to town.

363
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:28,590
Scott: Yeah, I mean imagine, you know, I mean you read history books.

364
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,770
Scott: It's just someone writing about something or writing about something or I've had something right?

365
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:40,424
Scott: This is a guy who was alive during the time Writing during the time in comic form about what he and his friends were living at the time.

366
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:42,790
Scott: and you know at that time.

367
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:45,310
Scott: I guess this is a topical work, you know.

368
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,300
Scott: And now it's a historical work and I guess that's the.

369
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,979
Scott: the thing about all topical works is they become historical works eventually Honestly, I think that's all I have to say about it.

370
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,079
Scott: Yeah, it's not much to say it's not very long It's just one book.

371
00:28:57,362 --> 00:29:04,738
Scott: I bought it on Amazon So you should be able to buy it on Amazon also if you go on Google Books actually be searched for it for Immigrants manga on Google.

372
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,210
Scott: There's a Google Books entry that shows up right away.

373
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:12,270
Scott: That has like the introduction and the table of contents and a few of the pages and both cut.

374
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:14,083
Scott: There's a lot of the pages from it.

375
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,953
Scott: Not the whole thing It mostly.

376
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:20,530
Scott: you're only gonna get like two pages of comic but you get almost all the other non comic pages.

377
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:21,138
Scott: It's not.

378
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,970
Scott: it's not nothing else.

379
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:31,790
Rym: even if you don't want to buy this at least read that opening introduction because there's even like pictures of the guy and Pictures from the era because there were a lot of Japanese immigrants in San Francisco.

380
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:33,015
Rym: Yeah at that time.

381
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:33,055
Rym: I

382
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:52,797
Scott: mean the thing really feels a lot like sort of an exhibit in a museum You know where you read a little card and all the good stuff is on a little card and then you look through the glass At the actual artifacts and that's just sort of like, you know You apply what you got from the card to the artifact and now suddenly this meaning to it If you just look at the artifact in the glass right away, it's just like okay There's a little statue in the glass.

383
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:54,689
Scott: very nice, you know, it looks cool.

384
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:56,824
Rym: So, yeah, I know it's kind of a short episode.

385
00:29:56,865 --> 00:29:57,630
Rym: But what do you want from us?

386
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,690
Rym: We've actually been going along a lot lately.

387
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:02,489
Rym: So this will give the lips in a little bit of a rest until we upgrade it.

388
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:07,370
Scott: Yeah, maybe we can upgrade that lips in sooner rather than later then make some extra shit or something.

389
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:07,692
Scott: I don't know.

390
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:13,781
Rym: I don't think we're gonna get anything extra done until after Katsucon probably not but that's pretty much the only from Katsucon.

391
00:30:13,821 --> 00:30:18,193
Scott: until like July is the only time we're gonna have because then It's on.

392
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:22,790
Rym: Yeah, especially if we do what we might be talking about tomorrow, but we'll talk about that.

393
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:23,909
