1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,668
Rym: It's Monday April 21st.

2
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:12,490
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:15,260
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,940
Rym: We talk a bit about the fears and misconceptions surrounding RFID and privacy.

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,931
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:36,080
Rym: I know we've been saying this sort of thing a lot lately But I got to say once again welcome to all the new listeners.

7
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,266
Scott: Hopefully there are some.

8
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:40,235
Rym: I can already see a couple.

9
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:41,280
Rym: someone was in the forum.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,235
Rym: We got some emails and someone already sent me a picture They'd taken.

11
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:51,300
Rym: but Yeah, for those of you who are at the event at Kinokuniya by Bryant Park on Sunday We were there with a TM revolution.

12
00:00:51,423 --> 00:00:52,139
Rym: We did something fun.

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:01:03,429
Rym: But we're actually not going to talk about that until Wednesday because GeekNights is actually four nights a week and you know Mondays are science and tech and Tuesdays are gaming and Wednesdays are the anime manga comic show that you're interested in.

14
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,373
Scott: yep, so today.

15
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:08,827
Scott: We're just gonna talk about computers and shit You're probably not interested in.

16
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:11,000
Rym: yeah, but if you're a geek you might have some overlap.

17
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:14,415
Rym: I know a lot of people in that line waiting to see TMR.

18
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:16,423
Rym: I saw some DS's Action in there.

19
00:01:16,503 --> 00:01:22,740
Scott: It still shocks and amazes me like like how many people are like geeks like they are geeky peoples.

20
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:24,850
Scott: They're in the same culture as us yet.

21
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,040
Scott: They do not have the technology knowledges.

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,591
Scott: It's like I feel well because well hand in hand, but I would they.

23
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:33,220
Rym: why would someone be an anime geek and be a computer?

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,873
Rym: I am yeah, but that doesn't mean everyone else is.

25
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:37,160
Scott: I know it's like it goes one.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,834
Scott: It feels like it's one direction, but not the other.

27
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:43,828
Scott: like if someone's a computer geek They probably seen and enjoyed some animes.

28
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,920
Rym: how many people on slash job complain about how much they hate anime all the time?

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,004
Rym: There's a lot of them.

30
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:50,169
Scott: I know, but it's it.

31
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:50,831
Scott: They've seen it.

32
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:51,413
Scott: They know of it.

33
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:53,140
Rym: You know yeah, they know about it.

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,747
Rym: They don't like it.

35
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:54,819
Rym: They don't care about it.

36
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,547
Rym: They know that it exists, and that's it.

37
00:01:56,627 --> 00:02:00,422
Rym: much like someone might know that computer technology exists But they don't care.

38
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:01,085
Scott: they gotta.

39
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:02,710
Scott: you gotta cross it over people.

40
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,540
Scott: you can't be just like doing one part not the other.

41
00:02:06,465 --> 00:02:07,319
Scott: Okay, yeah.

42
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,732
Rym: Anyway before this event.

43
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:25,440
Rym: This is somewhat more relevant to Monday We were hanging out in Brian Park since we Despite being press at the New York Comic Con we avoided most of our Presley duties because there wasn't that much of interest to cover And the only people I wanted interviews with declined interviews with anyone.

44
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:27,759
Rym: So that was the end of that.

45
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:31,894
Rym: But we left and we're waiting by Brian Park before our call up to go.

46
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:32,978
Rym: do the TMR thing.

47
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:37,705
Rym: in Kinokuniya We see some punk kids who were obviously Anonymous.

48
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:42,366
Scott: yeah, it was pretty much like oh, hey There's anonymous people who happen to be here like.

49
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:46,280
Scott: I recognize some of them from pictures on the internet like I've seen you before.

50
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:51,013
Rym: Also, they had a little sign that pretty much said we're anonymous and they had their cards.

51
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:52,076
Rym: and who else?

52
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:53,260
Scott: where else would you see?

53
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:05,080
Scott: Multiple v-masks a laughing man hat and other such things all on Young punk kids together in a group in the city, so I'm still dressed like press and I'm ready for this TMR event.

54
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,920
Rym: So as a result, I'm dressed up really nice, and I look like a businessman.

55
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:22,351
Rym: I got my little thing and I walk over and like excuse me and they all shut up and they stared me with this dubious look of what's this guy want a Scientologist oh, man, and I was like I'm a member of the press.

56
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:26,484
Rym: and then there's this double look of oh oh oh oh It's like.

57
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:33,894
Rym: and then I stopped and I realized they're all kind of afraid like wait right now I'm cool with you guys, and then they get they raise the eyebrow like no seriously.

58
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:35,780
Rym: I just I want to talk a little bit.

59
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:45,537
Rym: Hey, they're like hey, and then we start talking and I can say one thing they were pretty much anime manga Geeky people like everyone else like that seemed to be their primary thing.

60
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,784
Scott: no shit You really you think so?

61
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:48,988
Scott: 4chan people's.

62
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:55,047
Rym: well the fun like in the anime gasp the funniest thing was so Alright, and they're telling me.

63
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:55,368
Rym: I'm like.

64
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,111
Rym: so what's going on?

65
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:59,445
Rym: you guys doing one of your anonymous protests Is there a special occasion?

66
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:08,918
Rym: it turned out that they said that weekend was like Dianetics push weekend And they were gonna be there kind of pointing out to people that Dianetics is just Scientology and everything that means.

67
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:09,883
Rym: alright Which you know.

68
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:10,709
Rym: I'm cool with that.

69
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,832
Rym: Yeah, but then they're like hey Why don't you come cover it?

70
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:14,860
Rym: and I was like well?

71
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:34,198
Rym: I'd love to but actually in about an hour TM revolution and a hair squeak from this little crowd of people but I keep talking is gonna be in the Kinokuniya, and we're gonna be interviewing them for Japanese radio and The squeak happens again, and there's this one girl who bore a remarkable resemblance to knives.

72
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:37,386
Rym: chow Basically said that's trouble.

73
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:38,209
Rym: Oh, no.

74
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,900
Rym: I'm like the biggest TMR fan ever I can't.

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,708
Rym: He's really gonna be there, and I was like yeah.

76
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:43,452
Rym: He's gonna be there.

77
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:44,999
Rym: He's really gonna be the.

78
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:45,999
Rym: yeah He's really gonna be there.

79
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:53,149
Rym: and she was obviously torn 50/50 between continuing in her anonymous duties and Going to squeak at TMR.

80
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:53,792
Scott: Yep.

81
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:55,259
Scott: There are plenty of people squeaking.

82
00:04:56,182 --> 00:05:00,976
Rym: It was quite an event that I've never seen that many people in such a small space before.

83
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:10,900
Scott: all I have to say about it Now I mean I'm probably gonna say this every time we talk about this that guy is really small But at the same time there's so much energy.

84
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,950
Rym: It's like the per pound energy in.

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,240
Rym: that guy is probably the most energy any human has ever had.

86
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,406
Scott: I'm not saying anything.

87
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:26,193
Rym: It's good or bad, or I'm just saying he is a small Dude, I'm just saying that it's so like the smile never wore off.

88
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,179
Rym: that guy is like concentrated like let's go.

89
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:28,958
Rym: Let's go Let's go.

90
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:35,020
Rym: But we'll talk about that more on Wednesday because we we got some interesting answers out of him to some of the questions.

91
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,852
Rym: Yeah, the least yeah, it was a lot unlike what I expected.

92
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,183
Rym: You know usually when you interview Japanese celebrities It's like well.

93
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:43,588
Rym: What is your inspiration?

94
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,875
Rym: Oh generic answer about my inspiration?

95
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:47,300
Rym: What do you think about your fans?

96
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,674
Scott: Serious and flat answer that I've been told to say.

97
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:58,145
Rym: and when he said Something about if I had known that I would have my own Gundam when I was a kid I probably would have peed myself.

98
00:05:58,445 --> 00:05:59,428
Rym: Yeah, it was.

99
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:00,191
Rym: it was pretty fun.

100
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:03,300
Rym: Yeah, but I don't know how the anonymous protests went out.

101
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,870
Rym: I didn't see any mass media coverage, so I don't know.

102
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:15,030
Scott: it wasn't a big anonymous protest obviously but really what they should just do is they just hold hands and make a little wall around the Stress testing booth, that's all they should do.

103
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,699
Scott: that might be illegal is it?

104
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:23,560
Rym: But what I will say I have a little bit of advice for anonymous But let people through if they ask because you know no you can't really do it that way.

105
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,040
Rym: Yeah, but you know we talked and they actually wanted GeekNights fliers.

106
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:29,660
Rym: I gave him a whole handful of them, and they seem pretty cool.

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,567
Rym: But I know a lot of you were probably listening now anonymous, and I have.

108
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:34,650
Rym: I have a little bit of advice.

109
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:50,880
Rym: I Look at the way for those of you who were there that I was dressed and you guys I mean the the whole anonymous V laughing man thing works in his cool, but if you dressed like me And you were standing there looking very professional as opposed to

110
00:06:52,320 --> 00:07:01,032
Scott: Look at the Scientologists right they're wearing like really nice pants and tucked in like button-down shirts like all the girls are wearing like dresses and whatnot.

111
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:08,690
Scott: and So when someone goes up to them they you know they are crazy And you're not but you look crazy, and they don't.

112
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:14,289
Scott: so someone who knows nothing about this whole situation Are they gonna trust the crazy punk kid?

113
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:14,750
Scott: or they get it.

114
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:17,500
Scott: it's like the socialists at all in college.

115
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,294
Scott: They would always protest like you know out by the library.

116
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:21,460
Rym: is there were always three of them?

117
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:29,271
Rym: They're always like shirtless with dreadlocks yelling and screaming They smell bad that you know.

118
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:32,079
Scott: and they they had like you know hemp hats and whatever.

119
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:56,013
Scott: Yeah, I don't know, but it's like even if what they're saying is true or has merit they basically discredit themselves by acting hobos, so if you guys anonymous guys You know you have that little logo of like that little you know tuxedo that has no hands or a head or feet You should go where like you know your best Sunday clothes or whatever.

120
00:07:56,595 --> 00:08:06,128
Scott: and you know act very serious and Polite and businesslike and friendly and then people will take you way more Seriously, and you'll be much more effective.

121
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:17,657
Rym: because I will say watching that as the group grew And they're all these anonymous kids kind of hanging out in Brian Park getting ready to do their thing They were acting pretty much identically to the crowd at any anime convention.

122
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:21,014
Rym: Yeah, pretty anywhere It was I could have been in anime convention.

123
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:21,718
Scott: They were having fun.

124
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,483
Scott: They're having fun, but yeah, and they were probably somewhat effective But they could be.

125
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:32,909
Scott: they could have fun and then also be more effective at the same time Seriously rock the blazer, and you'll get a lot more people.

126
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,400
Rym: yeah ties work - ties do work not bow ties though.

127
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,812
Rym: No bow ties the mark of a crazy man.

128
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:40,119
Scott: Yeah, it's quite crazy.

129
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,118
Scott: All right, you want to hit news all right?

130
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:49,144
Rym: Scott will groan and moan about this, but I think this is grown so Zombie.

131
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:57,804
Rym: I have to say very much that tomorrow is the Pennsylvania primary Democrats in America.

132
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,148
Rym: this is critical.

133
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,080
Rym: I cannot stress to you how much I support Barack Obama.

134
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:04,287
Rym: It's not critical.

135
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:05,916
Scott: He's already mathematically won.

136
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:06,700
Scott: It doesn't matter.

137
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:11,374
Rym: No, he hasn't because the super delegates could just vote for Hillary, but then the primary doesn't matter.

138
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,079
Rym: yes the primary doesn't matter.

139
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,800
Scott: So why was this critical part?

140
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,624
Rym: No, no the whole primaries as a whole.

141
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:26,895
Rym: the problem is if he wins this then pretty much the super delegates would have to stab Themselves it politically in order to actually vote.

142
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:30,408
Scott: if you're a super delegate You're not also a pot like they're we.

143
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,733
Scott: no one knows who those people are.

144
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:33,780
Rym: you mean most of them are high-ranking Democrats.

145
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,429
Rym: You can go look at the list of all of them.

146
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,520
Rym: a lot of them are people who are well-known.

147
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:42,765
Scott: Yeah, but I mean no one's gonna be like oh, you're a super delegate, and you voted for Hillary, but now I'm not voting for you.

148
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:45,097
Rym: well actually that will happen but more beyond that.

149
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:53,380
Rym: the problem Is that it's as a group if as a group they vote for a candidate that otherwise in terms of the media perspective lost the primary.

150
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:59,840
Rym: Then a lot of people who voted in the primaries to suddenly feel betrayed, it's kind of like the Democratic Party falling.

151
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,840
Scott: Yes, I don't think the super delegates themselves will take a hit.

152
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:06,200
Scott: I think the Democratic Party will lose a lot of credibility.

153
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,280
Rym: Individual super delegates will also take big hits.

154
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,227
Rym: Maybe that's happened in the past.

155
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:18,067
Scott: maybe if the media brings enough attention to specific ones then yes You realize that it's also within the party that.

156
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:19,312
Rym: and what are you?

157
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:20,857
Rym: you don't even know anything about politics.

158
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:21,800
Scott: I know plenty.

159
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:28,911
Rym: Yeah, anyway if you live in Pennsylvania I encourage you to vote and you're a Democrat, and you had.

160
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:31,740
Rym: you didn't miss the deadline to be a Democrat temporarily.

161
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:34,480
Rym: I highly recommend you vote for Barack Obama.

162
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:43,583
Rym: but that aside The debate that happened right ABC had a big debate and they'd so many debates that they had already 11.

163
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,168
Scott: I think yeah, that's a lot.

164
00:10:45,570 --> 00:11:03,420
Rym: yeah, I've watched most of them on YouTube yeah, but anyway I didn't watch the most recent one, but ABC because they staged the debate set down some guidelines Because the debate happened on the East Coast and live, but they had obligations to their West Coast affiliates.

165
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:05,267
Rym: So what they said?

166
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:18,220
Rym: this I'm gonna quote the New York Times here quote ABC's guidelines said that news organizations could select one 30-second sound bite to use on television radio or the web Between 11 p.m.. Wednesday and 5 a.m.. Thursday mm-hmm.

167
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:29,119
Rym: So they basically said you can't show the debate you can't show any big clips from it You can't really do anything with it until we've been able to show it on the West Coast.

168
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,372
Rym: Uh-huh luckily now.

169
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:32,520
Rym: I have a lot to say about that.

170
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,217
Rym: I mean yeah.

171
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:39,622
Rym: Why don't they show at the same time on both coasts because then it it's at a time when no one's gonna watch it on The West Coast.

172
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,993
Scott: have shit for living on the West Coast.

173
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:45,178
Scott: you'll there'll be a West Coast debate later And you'll see that one, and we'll see.

174
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:48,035
Scott: well Late to watch there won't be any more West Coast debates.

175
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:48,618
Scott: well there were.

176
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:50,185
Rym: Those didn't matter.

177
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:53,359
Rym: well you had your chance and actually the debates were mostly out here.

178
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,148
Rym: Anyway that they deal is that one.

179
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:02,487
Rym: this smacks of media not understanding the world in that It's a global medium now.

180
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:05,399
Rym: I can get information from anywhere in the world at the same time.

181
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:11,500
Rym: so It'd be like if there was a hockey game in New York and there were fans of that hockey game in, Arizona.

182
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,340
Rym: So they weren't allowed to broadcast the hockey game live.

183
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:24,478
Rym: Instead they filmed the hockey game and wouldn't let anyone talk about their results Until it was prime time later, and then they showed it.

184
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:28,786
Rym: Yeah, or they showed it on the East Coast But no one was allowed to talk about.

185
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:33,705
Scott: of course people on the Internet people who are at the event live just go on the Internet and say what happened.

186
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:35,474
Rym: yeah, but they can't show clips from it.

187
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:36,880
Rym: They can't show highlights.

188
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,496
Rym: They can't show a long like.

189
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:54,298
Rym: well This is what Barack said blah blah blah blah, but it turns out that pretty much every news organization other than ABC Completely ignored this rule and showed very long Segments from the debate basically told ABC to piss off and cited fair use.

190
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:56,206
Scott: yeah I say fair use.

191
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:57,873
Rym: I'm so happy about that.

192
00:12:58,135 --> 00:12:59,280
Rym: the way this has been handled.

193
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:03,460
Scott: Yeah, I mean the timezone thing is gonna be an issue nowadays.

194
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:05,780
Scott: You know the information travels so quickly.

195
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:09,660
Scott: You know is you're gonna have events happening at times that are inconvenient for you.

196
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:15,360
Scott: I mean just look there were a bunch of basketball and hockey games over the weekend right some of which I watched.

197
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:18,530
Scott: But like there was some West Coast basketball games.

198
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,460
Scott: They were late at night for me, and I didn't watch him.

199
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:22,799
Scott: You know I just went to bed.

200
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:29,368
Rym: Oh, I guess I only paid attention to the debates that were near me because they're actually 21. the rest of those must have been Out on the West Coast or something.

201
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:31,399
Scott: yeah, when they would have been late at night for you.

202
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:34,751
Scott: And at the same way when some you know some things will be.

203
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:39,551
Scott: you know while West Coast people are still at work But they're prime time for us, and that's just.

204
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:41,500
Scott: it's gonna be in the end.

205
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:45,040
Scott: You know New York is on this side of country and LA is on that side of the country.

206
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:46,464
Scott: It's gonna even out.

207
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,008
Scott: people just have to deal with it.

208
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:51,980
Scott: time shift get your TiVo's get your internets and everything will be cool.

209
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,763
Scott: Whatever the thing

210
00:13:52,863 --> 00:14:06,342
Rym: is part of the problem is that like these West Coast affiliates or whoever it is who isn't in the prime time zone Have a problem in that There's no point in them showing the debate because when it happens no one will watch it and no one's gonna watch it after the Fact because I

211
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:08,730
Scott: don't show it just talk about it on the evening news,

212
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,300
Rym: but then they lose a lot of the ad revenue They could have gotten by show it like having the right.

213
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,439
Scott: But then there'll be another event that happens on the West Coast of the East Coast affiliate won't get.

214
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:18,881
Rym: yeah That's.

215
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:27,880
Rym: the problem is that in the global world people are trying to have it both ways where these West Coast affiliates want the benefits The global media and the fact that they can cover everything in the world.

216
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:32,580
Rym: But they also don't want to have to compete with the media all around the world.

217
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:32,781
Rym: Well,

218
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:50,999
Scott: I think the real problem is that we still have you know these this idea of the local affiliate And I mean that was the reason that there are local affiliates is from a time where you needed an antenna to broadcast television into a local area and Now really the only reason you need a local affiliate is to make the local news everything

219
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:51,220
Rym: else.

220
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:54,120
Rym: Yeah, that's the primary reason why we still have local affiliates.

221
00:14:54,226 --> 00:15:04,578
Scott: Yeah They should really just have Like places around the country that make the local news and then everything else is just nationally controlled And they just say okay put all the local news is on at the right time.

222
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:06,124
Scott: Because why do we need these?

223
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,515
Scott: you know local affiliate that actually programs a whole thing?

224
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:10,579
Scott: It's really just a waste.

225
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:16,180
Scott: I mean, that's why cable TV has been rocking so much because cable TV is just same thing in the whole country.

226
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:17,869
Scott: It's interesting thing in the whole world.

227
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,520
Rym: It's interesting because all the cable debates We're pretty much broadcast live across all time zones and no one cares.

228
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,073
Scott: Yeah I mean tell you the Fox News the CNN news is all those channel.

229
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:30,921
Scott: the cable news channels are kicking the ass of the local Newses.

230
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:33,148
Scott: all right, so yeah, it shows you

231
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:50,738
Rym: but it was just I find that really interesting that it seems like ABC and actually multiple of the news stories that I read about this pointed out that ABC in all of their coverage and all of the ways they dealt with this tried to treat it like it was a TV show Like a television event as opposed to news.

232
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,633
Rym: Yeah, and then all the cable networks treated these as news as a real-world thing.

233
00:15:56,673 --> 00:16:01,418
Rym: that matters at ABC like even though in The end they were all just trying to make money.

234
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:02,423
Rym: ABC.

235
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:11,520
Rym: it was like if ABC was like yeah, we're trying to make money and everyone else was like yeah We're trying to cover the news and make money and as a result ABC just looks really really bad.

236
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:13,871
Scott: No, ABC is Disney whatever.

237
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:14,896
Scott: They're all bad.

238
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:19,219
Scott: I Don't think any of them are good, okay, which one's good?

239
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:20,948
Rym: Anyway, what do you got in the news?

240
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:22,575
Rym: since you obviously don't care about this at all?

241
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:23,540
Scott: no not really all right.

242
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:32,882
Rym: So I still don't get how you cannot be so activist about everything yet not care about politics on any level local national state anything cuz like That.

243
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:33,544
Scott: better things to do.

244
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:36,633
Scott: the point of politics is in the perfect political world right?

245
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:38,398
Scott: imagine if all politics is perfect.

246
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:42,914
Scott: every Representative was was perfectly in line with what I wanted right.

247
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:45,887
Scott: the goal the goal The perfect world would be.

248
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:48,400
Scott: I just mind my own business and everything's great.

249
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:54,880
Scott: And I realize hey I can just pretend mind my own business and pretend everything's great, and it'll be just like that.

250
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,320
Scott: I just have to ignore all the bullshit, and it's like the bullshit uses in there uh-huh, and it's much better that way.

251
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,574
Rym: Okay, I can't I couldn't disagree with you enough, but anyway go on.

252
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:10,117
Scott: if I just turned off the news I would think the world was perfect, so I turn off the news, and I think the world is perfect.

253
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:14,449
Rym: all right You're willing to go with the whole ignorance is bliss thing then go nuts.

254
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,633
Scott: it works pretty well.

255
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:20,065
Scott: Yeah, anyway anyway, so Speaking of some bullshits.

256
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:26,108
Scott: right we've been complaining about patents for 10 years 20 years 100 years I don't know.

257
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,020
Scott: Patents are sucking especially the software patents.

258
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:38,039
Scott: You know every day There's another story some company that doesn't actually make anything has a patent on some bullshit That shouldn't have been patentable in the first place.

259
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:51,333
Scott: Then some other company that actually makes something like I don't know Rym the blackberry company not Rym the person over there or You know someone else has to pay a bajillion dollars or SEO.

260
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:52,777
Scott: How long did that thing go on?

261
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:53,840
Scott: remember rambas?

262
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,303
Scott: Yeah, rambas all right.

263
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:56,768
Scott: It's just a bunch of bullshit, right?

264
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:10,275
Scott: well the head of the US patent office John Dudas the same guy apparently who was recently Trying to promote like an educate a patent educational curriculum for children.

265
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:11,920
Scott: those things are always great, right.

266
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:15,673
Scott: That was telling children that every inventor needs a patent.

267
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,119
Scott: that yet, which is not true.

268
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:27,260
Scott: This guy recently said that Yeah, the patent office is getting a bunch of really really shitty patents, and they're getting shittier by the day.

269
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:32,300
Scott: That's a paraphrase, but he's basically saying the quality of patent applications is decreasing.

270
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:36,780
Scott: huh He's just realizing this now.

271
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:42,637
Rym: Well, I think the reason that patents are getting the way they are is that the reward for like.

272
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:43,680
Rym: the reward for me.

273
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:50,640
Rym: Oh, it's obvious why no, but the specific reward for making a broad patent is very very high.

274
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:53,093
Rym: But the cost of making that patent is very very low.

275
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:58,476
Rym: so all you have to do is Think about or look at what anyone else in any competitive arena is doing.

276
00:18:58,496 --> 00:18:59,319
Rym: and then?

277
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:04,335
Rym: Try to patent as many things as you can because you don't need to prove that something works to patent it.

278
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:16,198
Rym: patent everything related To all the technology in the realm you compete and then just hope that something one of your competitors does in some vague way Overlaps that patent and then sue them for licensing fees.

279
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,203
Scott: yeah And it's in.

280
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:22,085
Scott: judges have been constantly deciding on the side of patent holders Which you know really?

281
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:24,994
Scott: you know it used to be you didn't patent something so you actually had it.

282
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:29,560
Scott: like you know Alexander Graham Bell He had a working phone, and then he ran to the patent office.

283
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:35,720
Scott: You know Thomas Edison had a working light bulb And then he beat the other guy up on his way to the patent office, and he ended his in first.

284
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:37,011
Scott: You know you they don't go.

285
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:42,214
Scott: aha I have you know I've thought maybe we could have a light bulb and then patent it.

286
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:43,498
Scott: that wasn't how it was done.

287
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:46,308
Scott: and now Suddenly nowadays people are patenting things.

288
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:49,559
Scott: I just thought of like yeah, I'm patenting the idea of a light bulb.

289
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:53,513
Scott: I Don't even know how it's gonna work yet, but the real can't?

290
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:54,297
Scott: anyone makes the one.

291
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:54,920
Scott: I get the money.

292
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,186
Rym: There's no simple solution.

293
00:19:56,226 --> 00:20:03,940
Rym: I mean some people have said oh, we'll make the fee to apply for a patent hire But then that just prevents anyone who isn't a major corporation from ever getting a pen.

294
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:14,262
Scott: Well, I actually think patent applications should be free like it shouldn't cost anything to apply But you should actually you should have to submit the working Invent.

295
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:24,238
Rym: you know what I was about to say if you hadn't interrupted me was that Forcing someone to present the working invention is equally bad because a lot of times you can design something that will work.

296
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:32,325
Rym: you can engineer Something and that's most of the effort, but the cost to actually build the thing you have engineered is Extremely prohibitive.

297
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:42,819
Rym: so someone who's very intelligent who makes something good like a chip There's no way if I designed a chip that I could get someone to fabricate it Quickly and probably in a way that I could afford.

298
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:45,700
Scott: Hmm that is a tough situation there.

299
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:54,570
Scott: I think maybe you just had to either if you could prove that the cost of developing the Invention you know producing one was too high.

300
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:57,180
Rym: How do you prove that proving that would cost a lot of money?

301
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,036
Scott: No, if you could you would have to somehow prove that it was possible that it would actually work.

302
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:03,819
Scott: how though?

303
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,531
Scott: well If you can't prove that it works, then you know what.

304
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:08,439
Scott: how difficult was it to come up with it?

305
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,163
Rym: How can you?

306
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:09,946
Rym: but what do you mean?

307
00:21:09,987 --> 00:21:12,780
Rym: How do you prove that engineering design works without building it?

308
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:18,120
Rym: With math that doesn't prove anything actually?

309
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,110
Scott: Uh-huh not really well then what is?

310
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:23,099
Scott: how good is your invention if we can't even prove that?

311
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:23,380
Scott: was it?

312
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,524
Scott: Why should we give you a patent?

313
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,775
Scott: We can't even prove this thing you came up with actually works.

314
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:27,860
Scott: What's it worth?

315
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,487
Rym: Okay, so what do you propose?

316
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:32,394
Scott: I do exactly what I just said.

317
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:34,040
Rym: I just think it's a terrible idea.

318
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:35,448
Scott: What's your great idea?

319
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:35,870
Scott: genius.

320
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,956
Rym: there is no great idea?

321
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:37,700
Rym: That's what I was saying.

322
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,120
Rym: We need a more fundamental reform than simply changing the patent application process.

323
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:56,579
Rym: I think we need a clearer definition of The exact social and economic purpose that patents are intended to enact and then from there Go on to come up with policies that enact that idea as best as we can.

324
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,800
Rym: I think opposed to trying to reform kind of the interface with the system.

325
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,748
Scott: I think another problem that's been happening more recently.

326
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:12,186
Scott: Is that it's a very it's tough to tell like where invention stops and where Innovation the Microsoft Word begins.

327
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:19,308
Scott: like if if you know if I invent an improvement to something that already exists like, you know Is that really a new invention?

328
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:20,814
Scott: Well, how obvious was it?

329
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,220
Scott: What if it was a little bit obvious?

330
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,677
Scott: What if it was really, you know?

331
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:27,209
Scott: Is this sliding scale and we have to sort of figure out?

332
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,297
Scott: where do we draw the line as to okay your?

333
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:39,420
Scott: Contribution was significant enough to where you deserve some sort of rights to money or or you know, monopoly or something.

334
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:42,076
Scott: Your contribution was not significant.

335
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:42,780
Scott: You don't get anything.

336
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:49,520
Rym: Well, frankly, I think the best way to go about it would be to reform the system So that the limited monopoly is reduced sharply to a very small span.

337
00:22:49,620 --> 00:23:07,851
Rym: Like maybe you apply for a patent and you don't have to submit a working model but the patent guy takes effect and starts working when you produce the thing and then from that point and obviously a time delay whereby if you don't get it produced between when you submit the patent and This arbitrary deadline say

338
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:08,414
Scott: I'll see that.

339
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:09,760
Scott: Yeah, those are those it first.

340
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,624
Scott: Yeah, that's a good one.

341
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:14,040
Scott: If you don't if you don't make it then you lose the patent.

342
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,280
Rym: Well, if you let me finish there's a lot more to it than that.

343
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:25,879
Rym: So first you submit the patent and then if the patent is accepted then from that point You have an arbitrary span of say up to a year to get someone to produce whatever it is.

344
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:33,603
Rym: And if you do then from the time it is produced you have a temporary monopoly of say another short term like two years Maybe at most.

345
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:46,046
Rym: but going along with this we add much stronger protections on trademarks of branding and that sort of thing so that you get the actual monopoly for a short term.

346
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,954
Rym: you get the buffer time to prove that it was viable.

347
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:51,059
Rym: because if it was viable you patent it.

348
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:53,852
Rym: Someone will decide that it's worth investing in.

349
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:59,173
Rym: if no one decides it's worth investing in then Obviously your patent was either ahead of its time or in other ways wouldn't work.

350
00:23:59,494 --> 00:24:04,655
Rym: and then obviously the patent expires Maybe with a clause that it can be reapplied for again in the future.

351
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:05,679
Rym: doesn't some sort of delay?

352
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:15,407
Rym: So, alright so now after you build it you that company that built it and you get a temporary monopoly of a couple of years to milk It for money and to establish your brand.

353
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,936
Rym: but then after that short monopoly the monopolies gone.

354
00:24:19,237 --> 00:24:20,300
Rym: anyone else can compete.

355
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:23,553
Rym: but you still have the soft monopoly that you were there.

356
00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:32,300
Rym: first you have the branding and It'll kind of it caused this long trail off of your monopoly instead of the hard long term.

357
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:35,640
Scott: I think I think that's a good idea for consumer type products.

358
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:41,514
Scott: But actually I see a problem in that There are things in this world which take a very long time to make.

359
00:24:41,554 --> 00:24:49,194
Scott: if I patent some sort of new Like, you know equivalent of you know, the Hadron Collider It's gonna take a lot like ten years to build it.

360
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,360
Scott: if we do build it, right?

361
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:52,751
Rym: Like that should really be patented.

362
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:57,816
Scott: maybe maybe but you know There are some things which take an incredibly long time to actually make.

363
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,950
Scott: or you know Maybe we make one.

364
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,360
Rym: you want me to go into more detail.

365
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:10,420
Rym: I think not so simple as just it came off the production line But you set up a stipulation whereby the infrastructure is being built to put it in place.

366
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:13,600
Scott: I think what you need to do actually is the pat.

367
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,597
Scott: I think you need to actually give the patent examiners more, you know leeway you don't set.

368
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:20,002
Scott: you know this long It's.

369
00:25:20,022 --> 00:25:24,060
Scott: they look at the patent and they say this should take, you know, no more than X years.

370
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:31,879
Rym: I hate to say it but I think that's an almost ludicrous idea because that implies that you have to have the patent examiners be experts in every possible field.

371
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,003
Scott: Well, there are.

372
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:35,813
Scott: they have a zillion patent examiners and they're each.

373
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:41,711
Scott: they have whatever you're submitting a patent for They should have at least one expert in that field, but that's prohibitively expensive.

374
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,693
Scott: That's what.

375
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:43,796
Scott: that's how that?

376
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:45,080
Rym: I don't think that's a good idea.

377
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:56,720
Rym: I think that the patent office should be fairly liberal with this kind of system in awarding patents because a patent that is to blur Fluous will either be ignored by investors or will not be enacted.

378
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:56,861
Rym: But

379
00:25:56,881 --> 00:26:11,815
Scott: I don't think if there's a pet if they're no matter what the system is if you have some sort of Patenting if the person who approves or denies the patent isn't incredibly knowledgeable in the topic at hand I don't think they're qualified to make a judgment as a yes

380
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:15,067
Rym: or no about the way My system was put in the way it is set up.

381
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:22,760
Rym: Even if a bad patent gets in it's a very short span and With the trademark protection and all that it I think it would work out really well.

382
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:36,440
Scott: I also think that you know some like if the patent office doesn't have someone who's an expert right there should be some sort You know like they already have sort of a system where you know citizens can go and look at patents and make comments on them.

383
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:39,311
Scott: I really think that should be expanded like huh?

384
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:41,400
Scott: I'm not a hundred percent sure on this.

385
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:47,127
Scott: I'm going to mail it to an incredibly smart college professor who's an expert in this area And then he will mail it back.

386
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:57,260
Rym: a big problem with that is once you give people that sort of Scientific or knowledge based control over the system you have those people are often engaged in the industry anyway.

387
00:26:57,622 --> 00:26:59,412
Scott: That's why you don't do just one person.

388
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:02,423
Scott: you do like a. you know a bunch of Review action.

389
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:14,377
Rym: all of those people are engaged in the industry and unlike the side the hard sciences when you're getting into consumer technology Finding even a quorum of people who are not biased is pretty much impossible.

390
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:15,260
Scott: It's very difficult.

391
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:25,780
Rym: I think the easiest way to fix it for the least amount of reform and effort and problems is simply to have the very short Monopoly coupled with the buffer period before going building a proof of concept.

392
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:38,480
Scott: I don't think if nothing else we agree that the time and the amount of monopoly the patents give you has to be much shorter Especially considering the speed at which you know technology is advancing compared to say you know the the early 1900s.

393
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:44,769
Rym: well honestly I'm also of the mind more and more that Only physical things should be able to be patented.

394
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,660
Rym: absolutely not just not just like oh software patents are bad.

395
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,615
Rym: But I don't think you should even be able to patent a business process or a business plan.

396
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:54,989
Rym: I know only Physical engineered objects.

397
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,114
Scott: yes absolutely.

398
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,288
Scott: if something is an idea I mean all software is a number.

399
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:01,236
Scott: so saying you can patent that no good.

400
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:02,220
Scott: now see here's the end.

401
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,350
Scott: You should also not be able to.

402
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,540
Scott: it should only be man-made objects.

403
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,832
Scott: I don't like this patenting jeans stuff, right, but what if I made the gene?

404
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:11,960
Rym: if you chemically that which is that's how we do.

405
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,780
Scott: We make you chemically engineer something in a chemical plant right you make it then that's a man-made chemical.

406
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:21,799
Scott: But if you just take it out of my arm and look at it in a microscope you didn't make it.

407
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,622
Scott: So it doesn't count.

408
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:24,710
Scott: yeah, that's how I say it should be.

409
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,877
Rym: well even then you don't patent the end result.

410
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:27,760
Rym: you patent the process.

411
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:28,443
Scott: That's fine.

412
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:41,449
Scott: as long as there's a process involving the business process the engineering process As long as you're making a physical thing like if you figure out how to make you know the same Gene that comes out of my arm right and you make it.

413
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,720
Scott: you can patent though the you know chemical process of how you made It.

414
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,202
Scott: that's fine.

415
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:54,508
Rym: plus regardless the short-term monopoly with the buffer period and all that Basically makes it so that no matter how bad.

416
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:56,113
Rym: the mistakes are in the patent office.

417
00:28:56,394 --> 00:29:01,633
Rym: they get resolved relatively quickly And a cycle of two years is the longest.

418
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,400
Rym: well even with the buffer period alright.

419
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:08,995
Rym: So a bad patent gets through worst-case scenario three years of misery, and then everything's fine.

420
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:09,898
Rym: I'm cool with that.

421
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:10,479
Scott: Yeah, it's fun.

422
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:22,917
Rym: Anyway things of the day nothing is funnier to me than cats confronted with obstacles They cannot understand.

423
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,030
Scott: did you see that one a couple weeks ago?

424
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:37,082
Scott: That was like the guy had a glass door in front of you know at his front door You know we have a screen door beat a glass screen door, and he took the glass out But the dog like wouldn't go through unless he actually opened the door.

425
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:37,885
Rym: cuz think about that.

426
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:39,630
Rym: the dog knows better if he just runs At.

427
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:45,370
Scott: that thing hit something, but then the guy himself walked through the hole and the dog still didn't get it.

428
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,635
Rym: Well, that was just a dumb dog.

429
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:49,246
Scott: I know, but you know what I'm saying, but that's funny.

430
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:50,574
Rym: basically This is.

431
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:52,528
Rym: I don't know the exact story, but you know those.

432
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:58,390
Rym: Uh I'm gonna call this is an inside joke for those archangel dark angel cakes the ones you get it like a grocery store.

433
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,398
Rym: It's like a big.

434
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:02,335
Scott: you go to the grocery store, and you say hey I see that blank cake there.

435
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,584
Scott: write this on the right archangel dark angel.

436
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:05,849
Rym: Lend me thy ear on it.

437
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:13,687
Rym: no That's a story from the guy kind of the golden age of the front row crew something like that.

438
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,384
Rym: well Maybe the Silver Age.

439
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:15,768
Rym: I don't know.

440
00:30:16,252 --> 00:30:16,754
Scott: Definitely.

441
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:20,149
Scott: that was definitely like pre goes the ancient times.

442
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:26,990
Rym: But uh by the way just so you know those cakes in the grocery store are full of trans fat.

443
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,061
Scott: Don't eat those cakes don't want to get.

444
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:35,430
Rym: those aren't good cakes cuz we One of the FRC people had a birthday a few months ago, and I was like we should buy a cake.

445
00:30:35,571 --> 00:30:36,277
Rym: We used to do that.

446
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:37,570
Rym: We used to always get one of those cakes.

447
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:43,867
Rym: It was like a big deal when I remember to Which what we get them all the time at RIT because ice cream cake is a good way to go.

448
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,112
Scott: a little carvel get The whale.

449
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:45,917
Scott: I like the whale.

450
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,230
Rym: I think those have trans fat - I also like the watermelon.

451
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:54,749
Rym: But anyway those things as we discovered recently are like loaded with trans fat.

452
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,795
Scott: Yeah I'm no fan of you know.

453
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:57,638
Scott: you know I'm not.

454
00:30:57,678 --> 00:31:00,085
Scott: I'm not big on the nutrition, but trans fat.

455
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:13,308
Rym: I mean it's pretty much poison Followed closely by high fructose corn, but anyway those trans fat cakes always come with this big plastic Shell to keep them fresh even though if you take that shell off that thing is never gonna rot.

456
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:15,816
Scott: nope But so much preservatives in there.

457
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:18,384
Scott: I mean the frosting will get hard and crusty, but that's about it.

458
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:20,310
Rym: now cats love these things.

459
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,935
Rym: I've experienced this firsthand.

460
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:27,410
Rym: cats like a lot of things, but particularly those archangel dark angel cakes cats.

461
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:29,157
Rym: We'll just go nuts over these things.

462
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:32,670
Rym: if you leave one out, and you have a cat that cake is forfeit.

463
00:31:33,313 --> 00:31:37,170
Rym: But uh if you leave the shell on it the cat can't get to the cake.

464
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:39,422
Rym: But that doesn't mean he isn't gonna try.

465
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:40,930
Rym: and that's my thing of the day.

466
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:48,929
Rym: This is hilarious because he's just like Homer when he's trying to get to that almost there almost there.

467
00:31:49,010 --> 00:32:04,849
Scott: All right my thing of the day my thing of the day is going to be a a Shakespearean performance by me and Rym here Rym and I and If you don't know which actually Scott it would be by me and Rym.

468
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:07,621
Rym: Yeah, by Rym and me because you know you said two.

469
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:09,630
Scott: so it would be by Rym and myself.

470
00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:10,943
Scott: Yeah, there we go.

471
00:32:11,186 --> 00:32:16,804
Scott: so If you don't know which Shakespearean play we are performing.

472
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:18,289
Scott: you're a moron.

473
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:23,659
Rym: well I'll be more to the point if you don't get the joke from the very first line.

474
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,854
Rym: you obviously Didn't get it.

475
00:32:26,075 --> 00:32:30,688
Scott: Yeah, um and Then we're gonna link you to the the script for this.

476
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:34,030
Scott: this year We're just gonna do a very small part like not even like a scene.

477
00:32:34,191 --> 00:32:35,236
Scott: It's gonna be like a piece of a scene.

478
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:42,203
Rym: I uh I'll admit I laughed out loud Before I finish reading the first line because suddenly I realized what this was.

479
00:32:42,223 --> 00:32:44,350
Scott: I don't screw up the lines like you did last time.

480
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,392
Rym: What last time?

481
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:46,836
Scott: but the first time.

482
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:55,143
Scott: okay, yeah, all right all right, so I'll begin and Knowest thou what the French name cottage pie say.

483
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:56,950
Rym: they not cottage pie in their own tongue.

484
00:32:57,231 --> 00:33:02,010
Scott: But nay their tongues for speech and taste alike are strange to ours with their own history.

485
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:04,437
Scott: Gall knoweth not a cottage from a house.

486
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:05,520
Rym: What say they then?

487
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:08,790
Rym: pray hatches permentier hatches permentier.

488
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,057
Scott: What name thy cream cream is but cream only.

489
00:33:12,097 --> 00:33:13,480
Scott: they say la creme.

490
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,466
Rym: What do they name black pudding?

491
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:16,551
Scott: I know not.

492
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:17,876
Scott: I visited no in.

493
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:18,700
Scott: it could be bought.

494
00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:22,329
Scott: Do you want to keep going?

495
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:23,720
Rym: I think we can do the second one.

496
00:33:23,861 --> 00:33:25,028
Scott: We're gonna do the second scene.

497
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:26,174
Scott: We might mess this one up though.

498
00:33:26,194 --> 00:33:27,120
Scott: We didn't practice this one.

499
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,711
Rym: Do you want to be the awesome part or the get shot part?

500
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:31,955
Scott: I will do.

501
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:33,680
Scott: I was doing the awesome part.

502
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,565
Scott: I could keep doing the awesome.

503
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,389
Rym: Okay, you'd better do it.

504
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:36,595
Rym: Well, all right do it.

505
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:41,440
Scott: Well young My Pardon, did I break thy concentration?

506
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,622
Scott: Continue.

507
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:44,728
Scott: Ah, but now thy tongue is still.

508
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:46,794
Scott: allow me then to offer a response.

509
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:48,920
Scott: describe Marcellus Wallace to me.

510
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,026
Scott: Pray what.

511
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,299
Scott: what country dost thou hail from?

512
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,121
Scott: What.

513
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:54,265
Scott: how passing.

514
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:57,798
Scott: strange for I have traveled far and never have I heard tell of this.

515
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:58,160
Scott: what?

516
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,046
Scott: What language speak they in the land of what?

517
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:05,058
Scott: what the Queen's own English-based knave dost thou speak it?

518
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,589
Scott: I Then harken to my words and answer them.

519
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,440
Scott: describe to me Marcellus Wallace what?

520
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,764
Scott: Speak what again thou cur cry.

521
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:15,386
Scott: what again?

522
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:20,340
Scott: I dare the utter what again but once I dare thee twice and spit upon thy name.

523
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:26,620
Scott: Now paint for me a portraiture in words if thou hast any in thy head, but what of Marcellus Wallace?

524
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,123
Rym: He is dark.

525
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:33,254
Rym: I and what more his head is shaven bald.

526
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,079
Scott: Has he the semblance of a harlot?

527
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:35,520
Scott: What?

528
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:39,367
Scott: ah Has he the semblance of a harlot?

529
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:42,699
Scott: Hey, then why did thou attempts to bed him thus?

530
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,766
Scott: I did not I thou didst.

531
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:57,542
Scott: Oh, I thou didst thou hope to rape him like a chattel whore and south Lord Wallace is displeased to bed with anyone but she to whom he wed This?

532
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:58,063
Scott: I I don't know.

533
00:34:58,104 --> 00:34:59,226
Scott: I think that's all there is.

534
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:00,409
Rym: I love this sort of thing.

535
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:08,032
Scott: I We're gonna link to it anyway to give credit where credit is due.

536
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:09,258
Rym: credit is indeed to mr.

537
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,662
Scott: Cerulean st.

538
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:15,614
Scott: On the live journals or perhaps Darth Paradox.

539
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:18,122
Scott: I can't tell I don't get live journal No, whatever.

540
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:27,360
Rym: All I know is that it bothers me that now it asks me if I am if I am 14 before I'm allowed to view certain live journals whatever.

541
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:30,893
Rym: So, uh, what shall we talk about?

542
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:32,340
Scott: I do want to talk about the RF IDs.

543
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:35,575
Rym: I think we should because there was a. this will be a kind of short show.

544
00:35:35,696 --> 00:35:36,580
Scott: I won't be that short.

545
00:35:36,982 --> 00:35:39,432
Scott: Well, I think you could go as long as you wanted to.

546
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:41,360
Rym: actually I'm kind of hungry and I am hungry.

547
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:44,483
Rym: I actually want to skip all the technology I want to.

548
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:45,428
Scott: I want to talk about you guys.

549
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:46,535
Scott: only cover the basic.

550
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:48,160
Scott: that way they understand All right.

551
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,952
Rym: So an RF ID is very simply a small it will.

552
00:35:52,212 --> 00:35:54,058
Rym: there are common misconceptions about RF IDs.

553
00:35:54,078 --> 00:35:57,069
Rym: one Is that they broadcast information about you?

554
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,197
Scott: They do not broadcast information about you.

555
00:35:59,338 --> 00:35:59,780
Scott: what they do?

556
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:05,627
Rym: They're a little inert piece of metal and a chip Yeah and a little antenna and all they do.

557
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:07,092
Rym: it's called RF ID.

558
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:16,880
Rym: if an RF signal is present it has to be a fairly strong one because Remember RF will if there's a wire a conductor cause a small amount of current to go across it.

559
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,187
Rym: exactly kind of like if you take a magnet and you move it back and forth or spin it in the presence of a wire a Charge will appear on that one.

560
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:25,380
Scott: You take an extension cord need to play jump rope with it.

561
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:33,117
Scott: You can actually I get a light bulb to light up Standing if you're standing in the right orientation to the the gravitation the magnetic field of the earth.

562
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,220
Rym: Yes, not gravitation.

563
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,840
Scott: Yeah, if you had somehow linked you have to be standing what east-west or north-south?

564
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,161
Scott: I forget.

565
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:47,640
Rym: if you had somehow linked the gravitational forces with the electromagnetic forces You would have just achieved the holy grail of all sighs.

566
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:52,920
Rym: Better than Einstein would have solved the most fundamental problem physics has ever offered unto man.

567
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,194
Scott: But anyway, but anyway, so RF ID.

568
00:36:55,214 --> 00:37:11,752
Rym: you basically have this Simple in the presence of an RF field a Current will go through this chip which will cause it to broadcast in a very small span through its little antenna Powered by the RF signal a small series of bits.

569
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:20,159
Scott: in other words radio goes into the chip onto across an antenna powers it at each the chip powers up and then radio comes out.

570
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:25,533
Scott: and Actually if you put more radio in you can get more radio out.

571
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,680
Scott: so theoretically, you know, it's the same radio.

572
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:30,503
Scott: It's not gonna change what it's broadcast It's just gonna.

573
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:34,119
Rym: it's like if I'm the brought the thing and Scott is the RF ID.

574
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:36,449
Rym: I go Hey, and Scott goes what.

575
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:38,740
Rym: and I go hey, he goes what?

576
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:49,320
Scott: Exactly the louder you yell at it the louder it yells back But it's always gonna yell back less than you yelled at it because it's a tiny little thing that's powered only by the RF.

577
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,780
Scott: That's why RF IDs don't have batteries in them.

578
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,683
Scott: They don't need batteries.

579
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:57,420
Scott: all the the the radio waves coming at it provide all the power that is needed.

580
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,742
Rym: You know what?

581
00:37:57,782 --> 00:38:00,013
Rym: The nicest thing is about farting in an air on chair.

582
00:38:00,636 --> 00:38:01,360
Scott: It goes right through.

583
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:03,545
Rym: Anyway, I'm sorry about that.

584
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:07,275
Scott: So our FID technology has been used in many places.

585
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:14,620
Scott: in many places is replace the barcode Right because now instead of having to turn something over and finding the barcode or whatever, right?

586
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:21,283
Scott: All you do is you zap an RF radio wave at it and then wherever the RF ID is, you know It's in there somewhere.

587
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:23,149
Scott: It'll broadcast back.

588
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:31,363
Scott: Hey, here's my ID number and then you say, okay and then you know what it is and you look it up in the database and you charge them the right amount of money or It's great.

589
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:33,940
Rym: Like my badge for work has an RF ID, right?

590
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,437
Scott: So Rym goes up to his office and the thing near his office says, you know, it's always going.

591
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:39,139
Scott: Hey RF ID.

592
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,403
Scott: Hey, hey and Rym waves his RF ID near it and then he's I don't even do that There's multiple of them.

593
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:48,280
Rym: Actually, there's there's turnstiles to even get to the elevator to get to my part of the building.

594
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:53,940
Rym: Oh, wow, and when I walk up the turnstile says oh, it's Rym and it opens and I walk in and it closes behind.

595
00:38:54,061 --> 00:38:56,100
Scott: No, that's a more powerful one than what we got.

596
00:38:56,261 --> 00:39:05,723
Rym: It's actually really cool because it's timed so perfectly that only One dude is getting through that thing and I see people try to get through it and it just hits them right in the mean Mean machine.

597
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:07,232
Scott: Oh, it's so excellent.

598
00:39:07,252 --> 00:39:08,560
Rym: Yeah people get hit by that thing.

599
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:12,796
Scott: Yes, so it's it's Rym has a little RF ID that he carries to work, you know, and they have.

600
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:13,720
Scott: they have a database.

601
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:20,098
Scott: Yep, they have a database that says this number is allowed in this number is not allowed in and then Rym walks up.

602
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:22,206
Scott: the RF ID is somewhere on rims body.

603
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:33,007
Scott: He doesn't have to whip it out because it's really powerful and it says hey Hey, and then rims RF ID goes I'm Rym and their database says rims allowed into the door opens the Rym walks into the door closed and then

604
00:39:33,027 --> 00:39:40,053
Rym: I go upstairs and I stand outside the door of my office and then the Door unlocks because it knows it's me now depending on the employee.

605
00:39:40,414 --> 00:39:44,090
Rym: It looks up and says, oh, it's Rym He's allowed to come in 24/7.

606
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,518
Rym: Oh, it's so-and-so the janitor He's not allowed to come in except between these hours and these hours.

607
00:39:49,538 --> 00:39:51,540
Scott: or yeah Oh, that's all in the database.

608
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:57,083
Scott: You know the RF ID just has an ID number and that's the primary Misconception.

609
00:39:57,123 --> 00:40:02,276
Rym: that why so many people are afraid of RF IDs that it'd be broadcast in my business.

610
00:40:02,437 --> 00:40:03,560
Rym: Oh, no, it's my business.

611
00:40:04,122 --> 00:40:05,409
Scott: Now there is that.

612
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:07,177
Scott: that's not to say the RF ID is perfect.

613
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:07,800
Scott: there are problems.

614
00:40:07,962 --> 00:40:09,360
Rym: I mean, we'll cover this first.

615
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:18,430
Rym: Remember the key here is that in General the way an RF ID works is that it'll be a number like a serial number like I have my number two four six Oh one and great number.

616
00:40:18,913 --> 00:40:22,400
Rym: That's one of my favorite numbers Other than e to the XC anyway.

617
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,009
Rym: So this number doesn't tell you anything about me.

618
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,995
Scott: It's just my silver plate asshole.

619
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:29,820
Rym: It's just and candelabra.

620
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:31,494
Rym: Yeah, it's just my number.

621
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:42,740
Rym: and Knowing that number doesn't help you on a Getting my business information unless you also have access to the back-end database system.

622
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,340
Scott: Yeah, which is why RF ID security is really just database security.

623
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,579
Scott: I mean if you know different than a key.

624
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:56,920
Rym: It's no different than because a key is just a look-up except the database is physical and local and trivially broken.

625
00:40:57,282 --> 00:41:00,399
Rym: Yeah, but I mean are it has one it is a key.

626
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:08,560
Scott: All of the Most of the privacy concerns with RF ID are really just database privacy concerns.

627
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:17,714
Rym: They're really not any different, you know, yeah, I mean say alright So I've got the number and I'm walking around the anime con that's using the numbers.

628
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,653
Rym: someone snooping Well just could say, huh?

629
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:30,894
Rym: Well, like we can see that this RF ID went into this room and went into this room or this RF ID was standing here Or if they were snooping on the con goer level like they walk around.

630
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:40,490
Rym: they're like well rims numbers 2 4 6 0 1 and Scott's number is negative 8 and and that girl's number is 4009 but that number doesn't tell them anything now here.

631
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,240
Scott: Here are some situations where it could get a little tricky, right?

632
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:48,614
Scott: Let's say someone at rims work the person who say managed this RF ID system.

633
00:41:48,995 --> 00:41:50,780
Scott: They know what rims number is, right?

634
00:41:51,342 --> 00:42:07,440
Scott: So they go to some say I don't know Political event and they just walk around to the little radio looking for RF IDs and they're picking up numbers and suddenly they pick up a number and it's rims number and they can sort of figure out which direction is coming from kind of.

635
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,300
Scott: so They yeah, and then sure enough there's Rym, right?

636
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,667
Scott: So now they they sort of know rims.

637
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:16,540
Scott: rims at this event rims a Barack Obama supporter, right?

638
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,144
Scott: So they go.

639
00:42:17,366 --> 00:42:21,624
Rym: he's at an ACLU meeting Expected that what it does.

640
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:24,232
Scott: the the the real thing to worry about.

641
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:50,897
Scott: it's not really anything to worry about but the the theoretical dangers of RF ID are that someone who gave you an RF ID someone who already has a match of Your RF ID to their database can then if they are physically near enough to you Right sort of track your general location, you know and add that location Data to their existing database of information about you.

642
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:59,740
Rym: now In terms of I think the way this show is going now that we've talked a bit is we're only gonna talk about Not the technology and not even the good uses of it so much.

643
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:02,097
Rym: I think I just want to talk about all the security concerns.

644
00:43:02,157 --> 00:43:03,204
Scott: pretty much Yeah, I could do.

645
00:43:03,244 --> 00:43:09,943
Rym: we could do a whole show on the awesome and privacy also Yeah, but just in terms of security and privacy I mean the.

646
00:43:10,164 --> 00:43:12,972
Rym: here's the biggest real concern you could have.

647
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:18,055
Rym: but I think I want to point out at the end Why I don't think it's as big a concern as people are making it out to be.

648
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:22,493
Rym: so let's say RF IDs eventually and this will happen will be in everything.

649
00:43:22,514 --> 00:43:27,290
Rym: every article of clothing I mean tires for cars already have RF IDs in them.

650
00:43:27,511 --> 00:43:30,240
Rym: Yep, but products will start to have RF IDs.

651
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:36,557
Rym: now It won't be linked like I buy a shirt and it has a number that says this is rimmed shirt in it.

652
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:40,679
Rym: every Hanes Whatever shirt will probably have the exact same number.

653
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:44,033
Rym: So even if you try to cross-link database is like alright.

654
00:43:44,615 --> 00:43:45,880
Rym: Rym bought a Hanes t-shirt.

655
00:43:46,462 --> 00:43:50,072
Rym: Oh, look a Hanes t-shirt walked by my RF day ID reader.

656
00:43:50,433 --> 00:43:52,580
Rym: So did a thousand other Hanes t-shirts.

657
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,050
Scott: Yeah, and even if they did have different numbers, right?

658
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,460
Scott: Let's say each Hanes t-shirt had a unique number, right?

659
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:58,595
Scott: It was like IPv6, right?

660
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,667
Scott: Okay, so, you know that a Hanes t-shirt went by.

661
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:09,189
Scott: unless you have access to the Hanes t-shirt database or perhaps the retail store Database Rym bought the t-shirt.

662
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:10,779
Rym: even I could have paid cash.

663
00:44:11,229 --> 00:44:11,620
Scott: That's right.

664
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:18,840
Scott: So unless Rym work it Rym paid with a credit card and you either have the Kohl's database or the Hanes database.

665
00:44:19,463 --> 00:44:22,699
Scott: You're not gonna know that the Hanes t-shirt that just walked by was Rym.

666
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:35,138
Scott: You know to have access to the databases, which means you really only have to worry about Hanes or Kohl's Following you around or something or being you know Broadcasting RF IDs in areas where you go and

667
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:50,110
Rym: also the people who are so afraid about the stores finding out what you buy if You use credit cards at all Then all those concerns are out the window because they already know everything about you And you know what they do track that data stores constantly track what credit.

668
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,490
Scott: Yeah, are you are using a little fun saver card at the grocery store?

669
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,754
Scott: Cuz even if you pay with cash use that little, you know Club Savings Card Guess what?

670
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:01,190
Rym: Of course, I use one that I found on the ground a number of years ago.

671
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:10,319
Scott: So does Scott and so does Emily and so does Alex sometimes Yeah, and you can just you if you want one of those things at the grocery store You can just fill out false information.

672
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:11,103
Scott: They'll hand you one right.

673
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:12,510
Rym: then depends on the groceries.

674
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:22,353
Scott: It does depend on the grocery store, but in my experience you can just go up and be like, I'm Joey Jojo Shabdo I live on five Pine Street in this town that this grocery store It's now.

675
00:45:22,373 --> 00:45:25,687
Rym: they'll only give you a temporary one and then they'll mail you the real one.

676
00:45:25,747 --> 00:45:26,410
Rym: That's fine.

677
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:30,135
Scott: Yeah, I'll use the temporary one and every time I come to the store I get a new temporary one.

678
00:45:30,598 --> 00:45:32,590
Rym: that but you were gonna go for all that trouble.

679
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:38,668
Rym: I'll just get the thing cuz I don't care if the food line knows that I buy hams every Thursday.

680
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:43,449
Scott: actually It's really yet to decide, you know, do you care more about them?

681
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:49,996
Scott: you know look using your information against you as a way to sell you more shit or The other way to look at it.

682
00:45:50,076 --> 00:45:53,030
Scott: is you know, are they gonna make your shopping experience better?

683
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:59,207
Scott: I kind of want them to know that I buy this bread every week because then they'll keep that bread in stock and it won't Sell out of it.

684
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:07,070
Rym: Yeah or this group of people always buy all this Asian food and They also tend to buy the very expensive things in the other part of the and they come on Friday.

685
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:12,349
Rym: so what if we stock more of these ramens that they're always buying and we make sure they're in stock on Friday?

686
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,872
Rym: and They'll?

687
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,399
Rym: because we know that they're big spenders.

688
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:17,247
Rym: Anyway, they're more likely to buy that stuff.

689
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:21,057
Rym: Yep but here's the more paranoid.

690
00:46:21,097 --> 00:46:23,503
Rym: can security concern and this is the.

691
00:46:23,984 --> 00:46:32,570
Rym: if I were doing the evil nefarious things how I Would use RF IDs so I can't easily track someone without knowing their database, whatever.

692
00:46:32,852 --> 00:46:34,729
Rym: So let's say the databases are secure.

693
00:46:35,652 --> 00:46:44,003
Rym: What if I spend a lot of time around you and I grab RF IDs whenever I can near you And I get my agents to grab them near you.

694
00:46:44,023 --> 00:46:46,357
Rym: I know where you work I know the things you walk by.

695
00:46:46,377 --> 00:46:48,449
Rym: so, you know, I'm already spying on you.

696
00:46:48,952 --> 00:46:52,950
Rym: So I try to gather over a long period of time your RF ID profile.

697
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:54,742
Rym: You tend to wear these brands of clothes.

698
00:46:54,762 --> 00:46:57,074
Rym: you tend to wear these kinds of shoes Most people only hit.

699
00:46:57,094 --> 00:47:04,069
Rym: well most guys who work in the business world only have one or two pairs of shoes at most and they Wear them every day and they don't change them often.

700
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:13,523
Rym: So over time I can build an RF ID profile Whereby I could figure out where you are by having RF ID sensors in key places.

701
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:20,140
Rym: based on the likelihood of well The it's 80% likely that this is Rym because it is wearing.

702
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:25,255
Scott: it has 90% match ratio with as you Rym shoes and Rym Cellphone in the same place.

703
00:47:25,516 --> 00:47:34,602
Rym: Well, I see the brand of shoes rimmed wares and the brand of cell phone Rym wears and 70% of these general articles of clothing that he wear matches.

704
00:47:34,662 --> 00:47:40,330
Rym: profile odds are it's Rym And that sort of tracking is very interesting.

705
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:47,618
Rym: But I am personally not afraid of that kind of tracking because there are many many non Technological ways to do that kind of tracking.

706
00:47:47,638 --> 00:48:04,630
Scott: and if someone is spending that amount of time tracking you That's the least of your concerns, yeah, I know right and really all the data they can get about you is you where you are Now beyond that the the and if you're going to nefarious places, right?

707
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,070
Scott: Let's say you're going to some embarrassing places like say a strip club, right?

708
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:10,950
Scott: You know the real interesting and you know, you don't want your wife to know right?

709
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:16,030
Scott: I don't imagine you know strip clubs will be looking at everyone's RF IDs.

710
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:20,130
Scott: They'll probably be in fact blocking, you know, just to be like, ah, we protect you.

711
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:30,130
Rym: Well, it's like the scary porno shop on West Henrietta Road that we don't Right, you know every porn stop has parking in the back where people can hide their cars.

712
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:40,357
Scott: yep, also what you could worry about though is the porn store could are could get all the RF IDs of people coming into their store and then blackmail you.

713
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:42,430
Rym: it's like that Futurama where he's like.

714
00:48:42,932 --> 00:48:45,001
Rym: Respect the privacy of my customers.

715
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:46,186
Rym: Lila's like I'll beat you up.

716
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:47,070
Rym: He's like fine.

717
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,404
Rym: I videotape all my customers and blackmail them later.

718
00:48:49,424 --> 00:48:49,987
Rym: Who do you want to see?

719
00:48:56,152 --> 00:48:57,760
Rym: That's horrible, what do you expect?

720
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:02,388
Rym: I'm some horrible space monster Who runs a porno star?

721
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:08,338
Rym: but the other thing is RFID is RF.

722
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,912
Rym: It is so trivial to block RFID.

723
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,890
Scott: Yeah, you know tinfoil a little one of those little, you know, those little baggies.

724
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,096
Scott: They go around your easy pass.

725
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:18,960
Scott: that works.

726
00:49:19,221 --> 00:49:21,050
Rym: Not even that the range is not so great.

727
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:23,369
Scott: Well, you can pump up the range with more power.

728
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:29,310
Rym: No But upping the power one makes you more noticeable by people who might not want you to be doing what you're doing.

729
00:49:29,511 --> 00:49:31,009
Rym: Yeah, like in the FCC.

730
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:44,190
Rym: Well, no like in a snow crash where that gargoyle guy gets totally fucked by the fact that because he's spying on everyone with his High-powered equipment, he's kind of broadcasting the fact that he's spying on everyone with his high-powered equipment.

731
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:46,890
Scott: And they yeah, it's like, you know, they have a high-powered thing.

732
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:49,462
Scott: You're gonna need like to carry a car bat around you, huh?

733
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:50,789
Scott: Who's that guy with a car?

734
00:49:51,470 --> 00:50:01,869
Rym: Battery and a ghostbuster device just like in silent service, you know sonar Active sonar lets you see the enemy sub But it also tells the enemy sub exactly where you are.

735
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:11,501
Rym: And now you both have a firing solution and only Sean Connery can save the day by going full speed ahead Before the torpedo arms, but yeah passive sonar for the win.

736
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:22,330
Rym: that the thing is it it's difficult because alright So you up the power now, especially as RF IDs get more widespread you get so many responses from all the Hanes t-shirts.

737
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:26,584
Scott: Yeah I mean like if you're in Times Square and you turn this thing on you don't really.

738
00:50:26,645 --> 00:50:30,822
Scott: you might be able to tell Generally, which direction they came from.

739
00:50:31,344 --> 00:50:32,510
Scott: but you don't you don't really know.

740
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:34,669
Scott: All you know is that they're within range.

741
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,136
Scott: That's all you really know.

742
00:50:36,236 --> 00:50:39,330
Scott: is that this RFID is within range of where I am right now?

743
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:43,244
Rym: Not even that because they respond in the same signal space and because they're the same.

744
00:50:43,304 --> 00:50:45,790
Rym: all the Hanes t-shirts that are gray of the same response.

745
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:47,839
Rym: They overlap they collide.

746
00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:49,850
Rym: you might not even be able to read any of the data.

747
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:51,458
Scott: Yeah, you also might not eat.

748
00:50:51,478 --> 00:50:52,062
Scott: you might know.

749
00:50:52,323 --> 00:50:53,610
Scott: there are Hanes t-shirts.

750
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:58,470
Scott: You don't know how many you know, you could be one it could be a hundred and you just you just get this number back.

751
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:09,120
Scott: Maybe one RFID broadcasted ten times or maybe ten of them broadcasted once you don't know and doing it directionally is Theoretically possible but difficult and of dubious.

752
00:51:09,301 --> 00:51:14,490
Scott: It is much more difficult to get any sort of direction But I think it is theoretically possible with triangulation.

753
00:51:14,651 --> 00:51:29,029
Rym: I think I mean to sum this up in my estimation Scott and I are fairly well versed in technology and the two of us despite being very Protective of certain kinds of privacy and also look at other people are in the know.

754
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:31,689
Rym: None of us are really afraid of RFID.

755
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:35,963
Scott: Well, there are a few situations in which it is a good.

756
00:51:35,983 --> 00:51:38,109
Scott: there are some reasons to be afraid of RFID.

757
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:43,025
Scott: For example, if they were they were talking about putting RFID in US passports, right?

758
00:51:43,346 --> 00:51:45,756
Rym: I just have a Mesh bag.

759
00:51:45,816 --> 00:51:46,520
Rym: I keep it right.

760
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,945
Scott: if you keep it in a little bag with a little you know That filters out RF which is what I would do anyway, which is what you would do.

761
00:51:52,106 --> 00:51:52,548
Scott: You're fine.

762
00:51:52,688 --> 00:51:53,030
Scott: Perfect.

763
00:51:53,431 --> 00:51:59,590
Scott: But if someone's dumb and they don't let's say you're in a place that's not so friendly to the US say Quebec.

764
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:07,189
Scott: All right, you go to Quebec Right and you have your US passport in your pocket But you're pretending to be Canadian because you don't have to be pissed off at you.

765
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,765
Scott: All right, someone's got a little RFID reader and they go haha.

766
00:52:10,946 --> 00:52:11,970
Scott: This is a stupid American.

767
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:14,078
Scott: I will go beat him up now.

768
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,450
Scott: then this is a slight cause for worry.

769
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,020
Scott: But you put your passport in a little protect II thing.

770
00:52:19,462 --> 00:52:19,663
Scott: good.

771
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:20,064
Scott: You're done.

772
00:52:20,185 --> 00:52:20,526
Scott: Whatever.

773
00:52:20,546 --> 00:52:21,390
Scott: No, it doesn't matter.

774
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,821
Scott: now They can have the biggest radio in the world.

775
00:52:22,882 --> 00:52:23,507
Scott: It won't mean shit.

776
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:28,310
Rym: plus I'm not afraid in a more general sense because like people think oh they can track me.

777
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:35,053
Rym: But then if this technology gets widespread enough to where that'll happen RFID will be everywhere It'll be ubiquitous.

778
00:52:35,354 --> 00:52:40,710
Rym: and then the value of tracking you goes down as opposed to the value of trying to track anyone.

779
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:48,330
Rym: It's no different than it's just technology advancing and it's kind of the idea that you really can't expect privacy in public places.

780
00:52:48,691 --> 00:52:55,870
Scott: Yeah, especially as information becomes, you know so much more easier to collect and transmit more information is gonna be out there.

781
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:59,074
Rym: Just I guess don't do anything Nothing else.

782
00:52:59,455 --> 00:53:08,001
Rym: my opinion if you trust my opinion personally as a as a person who understands technology I am not in the least afraid of RFID technology.

783
00:53:08,142 --> 00:53:17,250
Rym: I welcome its inception and in the future I think we'll do a show on the like billion awesome things we could do if RFID became widespread.

784
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:28,489
Scott: Yeah, I'm not afraid of it for myself because in any of the few situations in which it might prove, you know somewhat troubling I know I would be smart I would just you know, I'd put my passport a little baggie and I'd be safe.

785
00:53:28,851 --> 00:53:32,478
Scott: But I do slightly worry for some of the unawares.

786
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:37,790
Scott: less, you know I don't want to say inept more inept peoples or more ignorant.

787
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:47,564
Rym: But at the same time, you know the US like if travelers were going overseas and this is an issue in the future They would issue the standard warning like got to get your malaria shot got to get you whatever.

788
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:56,382
Rym: don't watch out for terrorists and Don't forget to use your handy-dandy Special protect me from the terrorists mesh bag for your passport.

789
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:56,804
Scott: Yep.

790
00:53:57,466 --> 00:53:57,948
Scott: Yeah be fun.

791
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:00,455
Scott: Yeah, the only thing you really had to.

792
00:54:00,535 --> 00:54:06,670
Scott: the thing about RFID is that because you know RFID sort of has people spooked, right?

793
00:54:07,673 --> 00:54:21,770
Scott: And they sort of come up with all these, you know This and this and this that all the this is and this is that they're worried about are really database, you know Aggregation privacy and security issues, which is actually a separate issue.

794
00:54:22,152 --> 00:54:24,589
Scott: It's just because of the fear of RFID.

795
00:54:25,212 --> 00:54:37,259
Scott: light is being shined on this separate database issue and being attached to RFID and there is some stuff to worry about when you know people with big databases put them together, but Not right now.

796
00:54:37,782 --> 00:54:38,849
Scott: We'll talk about that some other day.

797
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:48,431
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
