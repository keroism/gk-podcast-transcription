00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,548
Rym: It's Wednesday April 16th.

00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:15,840
Rym: I'm Rym Scott's downstairs making dinner, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:20,797
Rym: Tonight we talked about some comic books that I kind of liked.

4
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: surprisingly Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:34,722
Rym: So what I'm about to say is not often what you would expect.

6
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:37,209
Rym: a geeky podcast like this to start with.

7
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:41,710
Rym: it's one of those Sentences that sets off a whole bunch of alarm bells.

8
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:46,464
Rym: Usually the alarm bells along the lines of the person I'm listening to is a wacko.

9
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:48,530
Rym: I should probably stop listening.

10
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:50,569
Rym: Are you gonna say what is the number for the police?

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,508
Scott: Are you gonna say something that sounds like like two in the morning middle of nowhere a.m.

12
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:55,910
Scott: Radio?

13
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,390
Rym: No, but I feel like our duty now is to hook up an a.m.

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,320
Rym: Radio two in the morning in the middle of nowhere.

15
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:04,170
Rym: record something and bring it back.

16
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:07,618
Scott: CC will come down and us like a ton of bricks.

17
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:08,742
Rym: They'll have to find us.

18
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:11,110
Scott: I guess they're pretty good at that.

19
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,936
Rym: I'm gonna say another kind of thing.

20
00:01:13,177 --> 00:01:17,353
Rym: so today the the Jews tried to kill me Did they?

21
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:18,881
Rym: but luckily I escaped.

22
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:23,123
Scott: yeah my knife wasn't sharp enough That Jews plural.

23
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:29,506
Rym: you see Passovers coming up as you might know because the New York anime festival comic-con the New York comic-con.

24
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:30,369
Rym: I always confuse the two.

25
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:37,003
Rym: Apologize for the fact that it's happening over Passover, and you know it is despite all our pressness.

26
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:39,190
Rym: We'll have to go to his family's house on Saturday.

27
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,019
Scott: Well, it's in Queens.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:51,850
Scott: It's not very far, but The thing is it's pretty funny because you know like comics are very Comics in the American the United States and Jewishness are pretty tight.

29
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:56,890
Scott: You know most of the big-time creators of comics in the olden days were Jews.

30
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:00,278
Scott: Stanley's Jew Will Eisner was a Jew.

31
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:02,849
Scott: you know Jack Kirby and pretty sure is Jew.

32
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:06,150
Rym: But there's something that happens mostly in New York City.

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,630
Rym: You don't see this sort of thing in a lot of other places except this kind of the downstate, New York greater metropolitan area.

34
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,069
Rym: I was almost run over by a mitzvah tank.

35
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,156
Scott: The mitzvah tank is driving around.

36
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:21,249
Rym: those know that the mitzvah tank went over the line this year.

37
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:25,364
Scott: Uh-huh cuz usually right that that's a special kind of Jew.

38
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:33,417
Rym: the the mitzvah tank Jews This is this was all right, so I'm walking on 42nd Street actually on 43rd Street.

39
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:33,959
Rym: Don't ask why.

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,450
Rym: up toward 5th Avenue, and I get to 5th Avenue.

41
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:43,224
Rym: I want to cross 5th Avenue, and I'm waiting but up ahead I hear all this ruckus all this noise, and I hear fire trucks.

42
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,700
Rym: I think all right something's going on Mm-hmm which is no big deal.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,110
Rym: you hear that almost every day in the cities.

44
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:49,783
Rym: I just ignore it, and I'm you know waiting.

45
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:50,710
Rym: what's going on?

46
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,341
Rym: I see the light turn green, but no one's going and there's honking up ahead.

47
00:02:54,361 --> 00:03:06,569
Rym: I finally get there and Despite having a green light in a walk signal and There's a crowd of people not walking because mitzvah tank upon mitzvah tank is running the red light going.

48
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:11,504
Rym: I Kid you not about 50 miles an hour really a lot of them.

49
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,270
Rym: there were like 70 of these things.

50
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,333
Scott: Yeah They have a lot of them.

51
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:23,244
Rym: they blocked 5th Avenue in a line one after the other going as fast as they could Refusing to let anyone get on the streets running red lights.

52
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:24,830
Rym: They almost hit this old lady.

53
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,370
Rym: They almost hit me because eventually a bunch of us like you know what screw you people.

54
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:34,630
Rym: And we all walk out into the street and one of the mitzvah tanks doesn't slow down and just barely swerves around the crowd.

55
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:38,850
Rym: And then all the other ones kind of pile up sounded like one of them hit another one way back.

56
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:42,222
Rym: And then there's all this yelling and they're trying to push through the crowd.

57
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:48,402
Rym: one a guy got out of the car starts yelling everyone To get out of his way, and then I see where the fire truck noises were coming from.

58
00:03:48,944 --> 00:04:04,709
Rym: there's this red sports car convertible And in it is the most acidic acidic Jew I've ever seen and he's standing up and he's got a loudspeaker and he's yelling at everyone to get out of his way and He's got a large boombox playing the sound of a fire truck.

59
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,525
Scott: Uh-huh, and he's not legal.

60
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:21,829
Rym: No so I'm kind of just watching this whole spectacle and the the people in the Mitzvah tanks as they get bogged down by people who eventually start walking out in front of them Start yelling at people and people are yelling back and one guy like kicked one of the mitzvah tanks.

61
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,967
Rym: Everyone's getting all crazy, and then the police came.

62
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:32,968
Rym: yep That's what they do and the police didn't know what to do because there were far more Mitzvah tanks than there were cop cars at that time because this had just begun.

63
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,674
Rym: yep So I see the cop.

64
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:41,301
Rym: one of the cops had figured out that there's this red sports car guy who's driving up and down the street Illegally directing this whole thing.

65
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:54,190
Rym: so uh Chase ensued, and I did not get to see the conclusion because I couldn't run fast enough But something happened down by like 38th Street And I can't wait to see what the New York Post has to say about this tomorrow.

66
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,635
Scott: You care what the New York Post says.

67
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:58,044
Rym: they're the ones that'll sensationalize it the most.

68
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,730
Rym: there'll be some stupid headline.

69
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:02,409
Scott: I'd rather read the daily news, and that's a piece of shit, too.

70
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:04,457
Rym: The New York Post is something special.

71
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:07,830
Scott: It's funny that they sell all these like newspapers at the train state.

72
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:10,198
Scott: I see all these newspapers, and they think most of them.

73
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:15,211
Scott: You know they're pretty cheap is like 25 cents, and I go wow That's.

74
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:23,449
Scott: I would use it as toilet paper if it didn't have ink on it, but seriously You don't know what a Mitzvah tank is.

75
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,239
Scott: Basically the deal is right.

76
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,683
Scott: is that there's a?

77
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,124
Scott: you know there's.

78
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:29,886
Scott: there's different.

79
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:32,113
Scott: you know unlike you know Christians Right they have.

80
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:33,558
Scott: there's different all different kinds.

81
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:38,161
Scott: you got Catholics you got Protestants, but then within the Protestants You got different kinds right and you got the.

82
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,530
Scott: you know it's all different kinds.

83
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,175
Scott: They all believe different things right?

84
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:42,498
Scott: and the Jews?

85
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:52,085
Scott: there's some groups of Jews who believe different things right, but in general You know just sort of speaking generally they they're Jews really.

86
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:58,042
Scott: they don't believe different things They just believe more strongly or less strongly right.

87
00:05:58,202 --> 00:06:00,990
Scott: It's like a Reform Jew is like yeah, I'm Jewish.

88
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,727
Scott: Whatever a conservative Jew is like yeah, I'm Jewish all right all right.

89
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:08,299
Scott: an Orthodox Jew is like I am so Jewish.

90
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:14,703
Scott: I'm like kosher, and I got two sets of dishes and a Hasidic Jew is like a Mitzvah tank.

91
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:18,155
Scott: You know well yes now The has not.

92
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,683
Scott: all the Hasidic Jews are Mitzvah tank driving types.

93
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:22,930
Scott: those are specifically the Lebovitches.

94
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:26,690
Scott: The Lebovitches are not only Hasidic, but they are crazy.

95
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:33,897
Rym: You gotta watch out for them, and you know how many people in the street today were like hey, you Jewish I was like nope They were just checking.

96
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:35,005
Rym: Yep, just checking.

Rym: but These Mitzvah tanks like.

98
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:46,790
Rym: the spectacle that I beheld on Fifth Avenue today was epic And I wish I'd had the video camera because they almost ran over so many old ladies.

99
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,041
Scott: Yeah, yeah, they're crazy Lebovitches.

100
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:52,510

101
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,680
Scott: Yeah, all right my day was not so exciting.

102
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,743
Scott: I went to work and did work.

103
00:06:57,104 --> 00:06:57,465
Rym: That's it.

00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:58,910
Rym: No no excitement.

105
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,418

00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,390
Scott: Yeah, well you know are you guys talking about the comic?

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,490
Rym: I had a lot to talk about this weekend is the New York comic-con in the Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

111
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,204

Rym: we could go do press stuff if we wanted.

116
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:22,530
Scott: I have to go to work.

117
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,044
Rym: There's interviews.

118
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:24,013
Rym: yeah I have to to the press.

119
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:31,886
Rym: the press thing closes at 5. so theoretically if I left work a little early and took a cab I Could do like a half hours worth of pressy stuff.

120
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:32,450
Scott: not worth it.

121
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,938
Rym: But Friday Saturday Sunday New York comic-con.

122
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:38,347
Rym: it's probably if you're gonna go to something like this.

123
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:43,457
Rym: I'm gonna tell you straight up it's really only worth it to go to one day because You're gonna want to do.

124
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:50,065
Rym: you're gonna be able to do in one day unless well Specific events that are on days other than the one day you go that you want to see.

125
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:55,745
Scott: yeah unlike a lot of other Comic-cons you know this one actually has a crazy number of events.

126
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:57,290
Scott: the schedules in a PDF online.

127
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,800
Rym: It's a lot more like an anime con in that regard.

128
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,234
Scott: well kind of but they just have a shit ton Number of events.

129
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,963
Scott: so most of them are industry events.

130
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:15,239
Scott: like you know it's basically Like you go and sit there for a half hour while people from a company like advertise their product to you You know or like say hey buy our new comic.

131
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,229
Scott: the craters here talking about the new comic to make you want to buy it.

132
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:22,597
Scott: So a lot of the events don't really count in my book But there are like.

133
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:24,330
Scott: I think there's over 200 events at this con.

134
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:33,318
Scott: It's crazy, but unless you care about the events if you do like comics right you should and you're in New York And you you know you don't go to comic-cons too often.

135
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,706
Scott: You probably should go to the comic-con.

136
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:47,010
Scott: It should take you maybe Three hours at most maybe four because it's bigger than last year to sort of walk around See all the booths see the whole artist alley and all that business.

137
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:47,513
Scott: You know.

138
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:57,745
Scott: if there's no particular events you want and to do that I think is worth it especially if you have kids and you go on Sunday and the kids I think are 12 or under maybe 13 or I'm not sure they get in free.

139
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:58,870
Scott: so cuz it's kids day.

140
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:07,809
Rym: Beyond that TMR TM Revolution is doing a concert there and the price of admission for one day to this convention is well worth seeing.

141
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:12,458
Rym: a live Concert especially from a pretty good guy Yep, but speaking of TMR.

142
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,270
Rym: We weren't going to go to the comic-con in any official.

143
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:19,280
Scott: I was gonna go maybe Friday night But not in any official capacity like we.

144
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:32,509
Rym: we kind of burned ourselves out with a million cons And we got every con in the freaking world this summer, so we were gonna just like show up to this one maybe say hi to some people chill a little bit do a little bit of our press blah blah blah and then go home.

145
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:35,440
Rym: but One thing led to another and for one repress.

146
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,230
Rym: we're gonna actually be doing the press thing and you get me that badge.

147
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:40,125
Rym: Well, I got a press badge.

148
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:40,670
Scott: good job.

149
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,480
Scott: See if you get always seem to you know fail to.

150
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,768
Scott: when talking to people mention that there's two.

151
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:45,848
Scott: now.

152
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,669
Rym: It's more that they most people see no reason for more than one reporter from any given group to show up.

153
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:55,037
Rym: Yeah, besides when is this ever happened before?

154
00:09:55,337 --> 00:10:00,190
Scott: nah when quite a few times when I can't think of it for specific circumstance.

155
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:02,389
Rym: Is there ever been a time when I didn't get you a badge?

156
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:09,398
Scott: No, there have been times when now you've failed to mention that there are two of us Such as I'll remember in a minute.

157
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,123
Rym: I'm curious when this has occurred.

158
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:16,509
Rym: Yeah, we'll continue with the show and then I'll remind Okay, cuz it's never happened This time either yet.

159
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:18,335
Rym: No, actually didn't.

160
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,890
Rym: I said yes me and my co-host would like to come and then they gave me one press credential.

161
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:27,704
Rym: uh-huh, but anyway We're gonna be going and doing the press II stuff but independent of that.

162
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:33,640
Scott: It's supposed to see my co-host and I Okay, yeah take that that's just cuz you have nothing.

163
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:41,865
Rym: you're making stuff up and now you're trying to cover for it But you got nothing and when confronted with having nothing you got nothing to do.

164
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,150
Rym: you got nothing to say.

165
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:44,696
Scott: That's all you've got.

166
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:46,042
Scott: continue while I remember.

167
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,709
Rym: Yeah, you're gonna remember shit.

168
00:10:48,611 --> 00:11:05,100
Rym: Anyway, the long story short is is that we also have our friends at Tokyo FM and We've set up this sort of event where we and them are going to be interviewing TM revolution at Kinokuniya bookstore on Sunday at 3 p.m.

169
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,584
Rym: For Japanese radio.

170
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:08,970
Rym: Oh, yeah, this is going to be pretty cool.

171
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:19,670
Rym: I mean if you're going to this con and you want to see TM revolution They have their panel with Brian Nishi I think and all this stuff and you'll see the concert obviously But if you want to see him up close.

172
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,732
Rym: You're probably better off going to Kinokuniya or at least you should go to the Kinokuniya thing at 3.

173
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:28,484
Scott: If you've never been to Kinokuniya, you should probably go there.

174
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:31,166
Scott: if you're going for the comic-con You should probably go to Kinokuniya.

175
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:36,210
Rym: Anyway, yes, cuz one if you're an anime fan or a manga fan, you've never been to a Japanese bookstore.

176
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:43,292
Rym: You're gonna realize there's a lot of stuff that's not in English that you would probably kill to be able to have a great English Selection.

177
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:43,774
Rym: they do.

178
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:46,386
Scott: you'd be saying I'm a brand new store in Bryant Park.

179
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,919
Scott: That's crazy and Beyond that it's just fun to go to the store.

180
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,305
Rym: If you're not an anime fan.

181
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,529
Rym: You're just a comic fan You're going to the comic-con.

182
00:11:54,891 --> 00:12:00,310
Rym: You might want to go just to see all the different kinds of manga in Japanese comics that are out there.

183
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,432
Scott: I mean Kinokuniya will have a booth at the con but you know They won't be.

184
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:06,443
Scott: that won't even be like a drop in the bucket compared to the store.

185
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:06,925
Scott: and it's not.

186
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:09,882
Rym: as I've seen with Scott You know, he's in the comic geeks big forums.

187
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:15,260
Rym: a lot of comic fans Automatically kind of dismiss manga and think it's one thing and don't see.

188
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,630
Rym: well realize I think it's just comics from Japan.

189
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,583
Scott: Well, I'm thinking you know more and more right that it's.

190
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:26,002
Scott: it's not like an either/or thing But I think that some people are fans of comics.

191
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:30,920
Scott: They like comics and all their forms, you know They don't care about you know, they like web comics.

192
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:31,984
Scott: They like mangas.

193
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:43,305
Scott: They like your you know, they like comics You know, they like, you know sequential arts, right, but there are some people, you know They say I'm a fan of comics, but really they're not a fan of comics as a whole.

194
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:44,750
Scott: They're superhero fans.

195
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:48,950
Scott: They're fans of you know, spider-man maybe you know and they actually you know.

196
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:54,992
Scott: That's why you see all those comic stores selling toys and movies and cartoons on because they're you know These people.

197
00:12:55,253 --> 00:13:00,270
Scott: they say they're comic fans and they go and buy comics every Wednesday, but really they're superhero fans.

198
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:06,470
Scott: Now there are people, you know are somewhere in between like I'm a tiny superhero fan and a big comics fan.

199
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:19,923
Scott: there's some people who are sort of like half and half or whatever, but I think that Even still the US comics industry with more than 50% of it if its weight relies on Superhero fandom as opposed to comics fandom.

200
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:21,230
Rym: I'm just saying all I want to say.

201
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,557
Rym: My only point is that if you don't.

202
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,397
Rym: if you think you don't like manga you think you know What manga is.

203
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,166
Rym: you don't really read it?

204
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:37,822
Rym: Go to the Kinokuniya after the comic-con one the TMR thing will be cool and to Look at you're gonna see comics about like old men playing golf Really closely.

205
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:41,790
Scott: don't just sort of like stand back and see like a wall of crazy stuff and be like, ah, it's all crazy.

206
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,329
Scott: Actually get in there and look at it like closely and examine all the different stuff even though you can't read it.

207
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:50,260
Rym: You know a lot of times you don't need to read it.

208
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,283
Rym: that golf manga.

209
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,949
Rym: I know exactly what's going on.

210
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,893
Scott: I know exactly what.

211
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:55,498
Scott: I don't know the details but know in general.

212
00:13:55,859 --> 00:14:00,324
Rym: Yeah, that guy's crying that guy's shot-putting That's all I need to know.

213
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:02,501
Rym: Yeah So yeah at 3 p.m.

214
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:08,803
Rym: On Sunday at the Kinokuniya bookstore in New York City Brian Brian Park.

215
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:09,205
Scott: Yes.

216
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:11,270
Rym: Yeah, you can find Kinokuniya bookstore.

217
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:14,801
Rym: I'm sure you'll be able to get directions to it from the comic-con.

218
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:20,003
Scott: if you ask anyone if you go to the Kinokuniya booth At the comic-con, I'm sure they will tell you where their store is.

219
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:21,430
Scott: They'll be happy to tell you.

220
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:26,650
Rym: I'm glad the anime news network has mentioned this even though they didn't mention us despite us being in the press.

221
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:28,106
Scott: I think my news network hates us.

222
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,909
Rym: They must you know, I guess now we'll find out if anyone from the anime news network listens or not.

223
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:34,536
Rym: Maybe I'm curious.

224
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,845
Rym: I really am because they got one thing going for them.

225
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:37,649
Rym: They got anime news.

226
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:44,556
Scott: Nina Yeah, I mean is Nina's the best thing on that website actually animates new work, you know You know, I guess there's.

227
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:50,455
Scott: you could you could criticize them about some things but really they're the only Game attack like in the end.

228
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:52,882
Scott: They're not doing that bad in the anime press world.

229
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:55,590
Rym: They're effectively the AP wire.

230
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:01,650
Rym: They're the wire that at least the English anime press world because the English anime press world is a sad sad world.

231
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,492
Rym: There's almost nothing.

232
00:15:02,854 --> 00:15:07,287
Rym: There's I mean what we are right there after the anime news network.

233
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:08,390
Rym: They say something happened.

234
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,618
Rym: We say rabble rabble about something that happened.

235
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:16,252
Scott: I mean, it's anime news service calm, but they haven't updated since September 2007.

236
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:20,530
Rym: I have some ideas about how to make the anime press better, but it's a show for another time.

237
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:21,889
Scott: Just have a competitor.

238
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:26,349
Scott: No, I have a lot of people who speak Japanese working for you.

239
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:29,910
Rym: I actually have some very specific ideas that involve some friends of ours.

240
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:32,017
Scott: So I got.

241
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:34,210
Scott: I got some news here from anime news network.

242
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,554
Scott: I haven't done an anime news network.

243
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:41,270
Rym: actually my other news is from slash dot but it's actually from the anime news.

244
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:41,793
Scott: Now you have.

245
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:42,576
Scott: you have another news?

246
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:43,682
Rym: Yeah, but you can go first.

247
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:44,104
Scott: Okay.

248
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:45,370
Scott: I thought that was just your news.

249
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:46,544
Rym: No, I got a couple of things.

250
00:15:46,706 --> 00:15:50,810
Scott: Okay Yeah, so in Korea, right?

251
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,906
Scott: There's some people they want to make a movie about Captain Harlock, which is awesome.

252
00:15:55,927 --> 00:16:06,279
Scott: All right Captain Harlock was created by Leiji Matsumoto who created Yamato and Galaxy Express and he did that the movie with Daft Punk interstellar whatnot?

253
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,889
Scott: five five five five five five five five.

254
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,156
Scott: He's pretty awesome.

255
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:17,976
Scott: As far as anime making dudes go right one of the number but easily top five easily.

256
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:24,849
Scott: so in Korea though, they want to make a Carlock movie when they have a budget of like a hundred million dollars.

257
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:31,582
Scott: But Matsumoto says hey, I didn't say they could do that.

258
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:33,166
Scott: What what's going on?

259
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:47,990
Scott: And It's kind of you know, and okay, that's that's all there is to the news, but It's I find it kind of funny that Japan the country where you know Do jinchi is so hot so allowed, right?

260
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,908
Scott: It's like oh if you want to use my characters to create your own artistic work and profit from it.

261
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:54,570
Rym: Go right ahead.

262
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,290
Rym: I think part of it's because they seem to tolerate that up to the point of large professional operations.

263
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,071
Scott: Well, yeah now see here's the thing It's like.

264
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:04,780
Scott: where are they exactly drawing the line here?

265
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,541
Scott: because in the u.s.

266
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:09,439
Scott: We draw the line at you are making money You are not making money.

267
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,169
Scott: I think that's a pretty clear line, right?

268
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,694
Scott: But there's no jinchi people.

269
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:13,659
Scott: you see a comic kit.

270
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,346
Scott: They're making a profit.

271
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:16,349
Scott: They're not making a large.

272
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,655
Rym: Well, actually the line in the u.s.

273
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:18,598
Rym: Isn't even that clear?

274
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:22,571
Rym: because technically you're infringing even if you're not making money I know.

275
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:24,339
Rym: I know some people do go after you.

276
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,665
Scott: Yes, that is true.

277
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:34,530
Scott: However in Japan right they see they allow people to do this while making you know small to moderate profits.

278
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,527
Scott: But it's suddenly when you know, they're spending a hundred million dollars.

279
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,310
Scott: That does a problem.

280
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:41,020
Scott: Well, what if I spent fifty million dollars?

281
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,865
Scott: Would that be a problem?

282
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:42,670
Scott: How about one million?

283
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,247
Scott: How much is how much you know, what is the scale where on the scale?

284
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:46,930
Scott: Is it suddenly?

285
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:48,054
Rym: One of those?

286
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:53,950
Rym: technically you shouldn't do it, but we're all cool with it But we might not be cool with it in the future and there's a lot like that.

287
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:58,090
Scott: It seems just you know, it seems as a as a moral thing.

288
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,541
Scott: It seems they're very inconsistent and they're just sort of.

289
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:09,058
Rym: but we're just as inconsistent I know but the only difference between us in Japan is that our inconsistency line is Equally wide but much lower.

290
00:18:09,198 --> 00:18:20,787
Scott: Yes, but it's very hypocritical of you know A single person because I'm sure there's plenty of Harlock dojinshe's out there that me that Matsumoto's not cracking down on maybe not maybe he hates all of them.

291
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:22,835
Rym: That's possible Sits up at night.

292
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,285
Rym: Just how can I get those bastards?

293
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:26,530
Scott: How can I get those bastards?

294
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:32,189
Scott: They don't know how to draw my tell properly girl But I'm sure he's not going after them.

295
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:32,792
Scott: You know, I don't.

296
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:33,354
Scott: I guess I don't.

297
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:40,010
Scott: I'm not a hundred percent sure on this, but I'm pretty sure there's plenty of dojinshe's of Matsumoto's characters.

298
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:49,566
Rym: But at the same time if you're making a movie off real movie with a studio You should probably at least ask the copyright, right?

299
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,233
Scott: All right, that's true I'm not.

300
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:55,570
Scott: I'm not saying these Korean people are doing great at this point, you know, plus the you know.

301
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,484
Scott: This is only gonna get worse from here as you know, let me look at us.

302
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:07,829
Scott: They're podcasting right now, right as amateur media production Right and professional media production get closer and closer to each other.

303
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:09,998
Scott: Where's the line gonna be?

304
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:10,761
Scott: you're not gonna be.

305
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:14,636
Scott: you know, if you say it's okay for amateurs It's not okay for professionals.

306
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:19,218
Scott: Well as amateurs are able to make professional products You know, what?

307
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,530
Scott: what really is your distinction?

308
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,261
Scott: Well, I've seen really whimsical and subjective.

309
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,828
Scott: deciding who to pick on.

310
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:29,370
Rym: the way It's usually determined is simply by the scale of distribution.

311
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,650
Rym: If I make a hundred dojinshe's no one cares.

312
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,977
Scott: But what if I find my doji and put it on the Internet's?

313
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,472
Scott: that's that's different because that's not that's the biggest scale of distribution You can get.

314
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:41,581
Rym: yes, but no one pays attention to that.

315
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:47,162
Rym: or because not yet at least Yeah, it just seems like cuz then you're not making money off of it.

316
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:48,506
Scott: You could be so.

317
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,493
Rym: you're selling it online Possible.

318
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:51,640
Rym: Well, how many do you sell?

319
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,290
Rym: You'd probably sell more of your selling in person.

320
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,849
Rym: Maybe you could sell memberships to your doubt your doujinshi downloading site And I don't know how many people would pay for that.

321
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,227
Scott: I don't know if you had a really good doujinshi's in English and there were lots of them.

322
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:02,729
Scott: I might pay.

323
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:03,855
Rym: I just don't know.

324
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,066
Rym: not as much of a hypocritical issues.

325
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:06,890
Rym: You're making it out to be.

326
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:10,810
Scott: I just think Japan really needs to straighten out their their situation.

327
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,343
Rym: I think the US needs to straighten out it's situation.

328
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:14,790
Scott: Everyone needs to straighten out the situation.

329
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:20,996
Scott: I think Japan has a little worse and I also think that This this movie.

330
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:22,924
Scott: I hope they make it because it sounds like awesome.

331
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:23,949
Rym: I don't know.

332
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,107
Scott: I mean, you don't know a hundred million dollar Harlock movie can't go wrong.

333
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:28,750
Rym: We'll see.

334
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,016
Rym: I've seen some hundred million dollar movies in my day.

335
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:33,843
Scott: There's a lack of Movies.

336
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:35,148
Scott: I will take what I can get.

337
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:36,614
Rym: What are you talking about?

338
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:37,919
Rym: There's tons of movies.

339
00:20:38,982 --> 00:20:39,584
Rym: What movies?

340
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:40,086
Rym: what do you mean?

341
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:40,749
Rym: What movies?

342
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,500
Rym: Well, we've never even seen strange days.

343
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:44,604
Scott: I'm talking about like.

344
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:46,270
Scott: I'm talking about the anime movie.

345
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,414
Rym: Oh anime movies.

346
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:50,287
Rym: Yeah, but isn't this a live-action Is it?

347
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:51,394
Scott: no, I don't think so.

348
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:52,058
Rym: Are you sure?

349
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:03,993
Scott: Uh Into a film something so it doesn't actually say, uh-huh Yeah, huh, that's a good question Captain news.

350
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:06,201
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't say live-action or not.

351
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:10,686
Scott: You know what if it's live-action double awesome That would be sweet live-action Harlock.

352
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,557
Rym: Anyway, I want to really briefly mention this.

353
00:21:15,597 --> 00:21:20,432
Rym: just because it was brought up in the anime press and a lot of people lost their shit over it.

354
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:21,796
Rym: some kind of know how.

355
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:28,283
Rym: I used RF IDs and I saw a lot of rabble on the internet rambling about oh My god, I'd never go to a con that did that.

356
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:30,454
Rym: All I have to say is chill Totally chill.

357
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,130
Rym: eventually every convention in the world is going to be doing that.

358
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,998
Rym: It's just a matter of the technology getting better.

359
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:37,369
Rym: Yeah, and it's a good thing and I'll leave it at that.

360
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:38,659
Scott: No, you see that's all.

361
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,769
Rym: I guess that's all I'm gonna say.

362
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,725
Scott: You're not gonna talk about RFID technology and how it works and what oh god.

363
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:44,990
Rym: No, that's a Monday show.

364
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:46,962
Scott: All right, we should do a Monday on RFID.

365
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:51,990
Scott: It's pretty simple though Yeah, but I guess we could talk a lot about not just the technology of it, but the implications.

366
00:21:52,191 --> 00:22:05,309
Scott: Yeah, cuz the technology is really really really really yeah and the uses for it and you know when you should worry when you should Things of the day.

367
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:10,270
Rym: While ago, we used an awesome awesome sumo fight as a thing of the day.

368
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:17,349
Rym: This one is not technically as awesome But in many ways it is more awesome and I will leave it at that.

369
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:22,069
Scott: I really think that what was done it to the in this video that you're gonna see.

370
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:27,250
Scott: I really think that we should develop a technology that does this in real time.

371
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:33,690
Scott: Football exact adds it in real time to all sports all sports on television.

372
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:46,594
Rym: And if you thought that I remember when you should patent that idea before you invented I remember in hockey when they added the glow puck the glow puck and then they added the comic the comment whenever someone shot Yeah, the fire.

373
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:50,130
Rym: Yeah, and I remember thinking wow, that's really stupid.

374
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:53,030
Scott: It was cool for like five minutes and then it wasn't cool anymore.

375
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:56,867
Scott: Yeah, but the one thing is it did make it a little bit easier to see the puck.

376
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:57,972
Scott: when they're a bunch of guys It's out.

377
00:22:58,032 --> 00:23:01,530
Rym: Well in the pre HD era it was critical for watching sports on.

378
00:23:01,611 --> 00:23:16,030
Scott: Yeah You realize like hockey was one of the first things ever put in HD because Madison Square Garden the building which is where the rain New York Rangers, New York Knicks basketball play right is owned by cable vision, which is the people who give us cable here.

379
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:23,542
Scott: And so cable vision actually has a TV channel called MSG which basically shows Rangers and Knicks games.

380
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:26,796
Scott: and I Remember we had cable vision.

381
00:23:27,237 --> 00:23:33,065
Scott: and the first thing that was ever in HD like way before Like HD was even popular.

382
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:37,964
Scott: like we're talking Mid to late 90s here like before most people even knew HD before.

383
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,055
Scott: there are any standards before anyone knew 720p or anything like that.

384
00:23:41,517 --> 00:23:44,850
Scott: if you had bought an HD TV in those days, it probably wouldn't work nowadays.

385
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:48,849
Scott: But New York Rangers hockey was like the first thing ever in HD.

386
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:55,356
Scott: And if you actually went to Madison Square Garden and HD TVs all around and you could you know You know what and he was like, wow, look at that.

387
00:23:55,556 --> 00:23:57,081
Rym: Why leave this for sports.

388
00:23:57,463 --> 00:23:58,807
Rym: We should add this to the news.

389
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:03,177
Scott: Oh That's cruel and funny.

390
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:04,402
Rym: anyway, okay.

391
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:05,767
Scott: Oh my thing of the day, right?

392
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:11,790
Scott: Yeah So, you know when you're looking for a place to live this has nothing to do with anime or anything.

393
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:16,190
Scott: Is that this new thing of day out of nowhere, but I have a better thing a day for tomorrow.

394
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:18,470
Scott: So I didn't want to like, you know use this one tomorrow, whatever.

395
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:24,890
Scott: When you're looking for a place to live right the the two biggest things you got to worry about, right?

396
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:34,212
Scott: I mean if you look at I look at my expense report on my accounting little program right two basic expenses right our rent and Transportation.

397
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:40,310
Scott: right those like the place you live and the thing that gets you to other places, especially if you commute to work, right?

398
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:50,843
Scott: so When you pick a place to live it's like well I could move over here and the rent is $500 less a month But my transportation is gonna be $600 more a month.

399
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,179
Scott: So I'm actually better off staying where I am.

400
00:24:54,199 --> 00:25:22,308
Scott: All right, and there's other factors you have to take into account But here's an interesting website That begins to solve the problem of helping you figure out where the most economically efficient place to live is where you want to go and what they have is they show you Housing or housing plus transportation as A percentage of the median income in the area in a visual way on this map,

401
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,769
Rym: huh?

402
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:33,947
Scott: Yeah, so you can look at this map in New York, right and you look like it's funny because you look at Manhattan Right and it's like tan means zero to thirty percent or you know, you can.

403
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:34,730
Scott: there's different options.

404
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:47,690
Scott: You can choose, you know, but tan is like, you know, you're spending less than you know Some percent of your you know income on housing and transportation and blue is you're spending more than a certain percent of your.

405
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:51,482
Scott: You know stuff on housing and transportation and it's like, huh?

406
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:55,776
Scott: You see all these like blue specks in Manhattan You can tell like some areas.

407
00:25:56,017 --> 00:25:58,226
Scott: It's like oh, yeah, that's that's a cheap place to live.

408
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:00,704
Scott: That's an expensive place to live That's the place where nobody lives.

409
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:01,309
Scott: All right.

410
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:17,530
Scott: And then as soon as you go up into the Bronx It's all tan and then as soon as you get up to like Yonkers Tarrytown It starts turning deep blue all the way up pretty much Splotches in the places where people don't live far away from highways and transportation.

411
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:18,816
Rym: Huh?

412
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,584
Scott: Yeah.

413
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:31,169
Rym: Yeah well at least Scott and I are at the point and as with much of the front row crew where we really We can't live more than an hour away from a global like international city or there's no jobs for us.

414
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,173
Scott: Yeah, anyway, let's see.

415
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:33,895
Scott: I'm looking here.

416
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:40,720
Scott: Yeah, actually beacon is tan and Like the thing is Putnam County below us is blue.

417
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:43,199
Rym: Yeah, yeah, you want to know why?

418
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,728
Rym: Yep, because we we tend.

419
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:48,860
Rym: I think we make actually a lot more money than the median for beacon right now.

420
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,726
Scott: But the thing will tell you what the median income is Income for beacon.

421
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:53,269
Rym: What's it say?

422
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,857
Scott: I got to go to the beacon area.

423
00:26:54,938 --> 00:26:55,400
Rym: I'm curious.

424
00:26:55,601 --> 00:27:00,618
Scott: Oh, actually it only tells you for New York North in New Jersey Long Island doesn't tell you for beacons.

425
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:01,280
Scott: visit the map.

426
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:02,979
Scott: It's not perfect, but it's a start.

427
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:05,027
Rym: So then how's it even calculating up here?

428
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:09,020
Scott: it cuz it has I don't know but you don't tell me the number.

429
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,868
Rym: I assume it's just making something up.

430
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:13,820
Rym: Yeah, it'd be blue here a little purple here a little bit.

431
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,079
Scott: Uh, yeah, it is an advanced mode that I haven't used but it's you know, it's interesting at the least.

432
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:20,902
Scott: if it's not It's not.

433
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:24,822
Scott: you know that useful yet, but I definitely see it going places Right.

434
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:29,740
Rym: So we were gonna try to review Toki wa kakoto shoujo tonight, but Scott didn't watch it.

435
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,106
Scott: How am I supposed to watch it?

436
00:27:31,347 --> 00:27:31,729
Scott: I don't know.

437
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,236
Scott: train where is it?

438
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:34,140
Rym: we had it for you.

439
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,405
Rym: We said several times you want it.

440
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:36,428
Rym: I'll give it to you.

441
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,653
Scott: I'm reading books.

442
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,431
Rym: Okay, and stuff Do you watch a Kazanoyo Jimbo yet?

443

00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:42,739
Rym: Do you watch?

445
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,325
Rym: Boca Rondo yet.

446
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:45,350
Scott: I did.

447
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,199
Scott: I watched as many as I watched before.

448
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:49,086
Rym: How about Baca now?

449
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,774
Scott: I watched as many as I watched before avatar.

450
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:53,480
Rym: No, okay great.

451
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,611
Rym: So, uh, I guess instead since Scott won't watch anime.

452
00:27:56,651 --> 00:27:57,635
Rym: I read some comic books.

453
00:27:57,996 --> 00:27:59,040
Scott: Oh, yeah, that's right.

454
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:03,983
Rym: I liked half of the series that I read All right.

455
00:28:04,003 --> 00:28:06,872
Rym: So tonight first we're gonna talk about I. let's start with something.

456
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:07,234
Rym: I liked.

457
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:11,824
Rym: All right, Scott handed me Invincible volume one.

458
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:14,451
Scott: so invincible is written by Robert Kirkman.

459
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:16,596
Scott: Who's the the Walking Dead guy, right?

460
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:23,515
Scott: He also did that at the The the Wolfman comic on free comic book day that I didn't like.

461
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,560
Scott: that was terrible, right?

462
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,568
Scott: So I had heard about invincible.

463
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:30,286
Scott: people kept talking it up talking it up talking it up Right, and I'm like, all right, whatever.

464
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,194
Scott: I'll buy the first trade paperback.

465
00:28:32,535 --> 00:28:33,600
Scott: It can't hurt, right?

466
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,732
Scott: I mean, I'll try it, you know, and I don't knock things till I try them.

467
00:28:37,275 --> 00:28:40,664
Scott: So I bought the first one and It's not deep.

468
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:42,490
Scott: It's not serious.

469
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:42,831
Scott: It's not.

470
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:43,895
Scott: it's not like the Watchmen.

471
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,300
Scott: It's not a comic for all time.

472
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:50,600
Scott: It's just sort of plain and fun and bright and happy and I liked it.

473
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:56,267
Scott: It's sort of just like a nice diversion like ah I think the only real like.

474
00:28:56,327 --> 00:29:00,540
Rym: I liked it partly because it was it so clearly did not take itself seriously.

475
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,685
Rym: I'm just like, yeah, whatever.

476
00:29:01,705 --> 00:29:02,831
Rym: Yeah, let's go.

477
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:07,030
Rym: Let's go funny funny funny and One thing it uses the dot eyes a lot.

478
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:12,375
Rym: Yeah dot eyes the thing I think that's a good half of why I like Nana was the dot eyes.

479
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:12,858
Rym: Yeah.

480
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,424
Scott: Yeah Do you want to summarize the plot?

481
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:15,387
Scott: we can summarize the plot.

482
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:19,340
Rym: whatever world of superheroes kid becomes a superhero because his dad's a superhero.

483
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:21,140
Rym: The mom is awesome.

484
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:23,647
Rym: yeah, basically they fight crime.

485
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:32,699
Scott: his dad is basically like Superman and then as he grows up eventually he Gets powers and he's like, I got some my superpowers and they're like, that's nice dear.

486
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:35,345
Scott: And it's you know, he's.

487
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:48,063
Scott: he's dealing with sort of normal high school life and has all the classic You know tropes of a superhero story, you know keeping your identity secret, you know Teams of other people, you know All this stuff.

488
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:50,932
Scott: but everyone it just sort of doesn't?

489
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:51,855
Scott: it doesn't?

490
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:53,580
Scott: it treats it in a different way.

491
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,467
Scott: it's just sort of like every people act normally despite living in a Stereotypical situation.

492
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:02,640
Rym: It's so light and it's it's funny.

493
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:07,726
Rym: Just the one part that I laughed out loud is at the end near the end Where the dad comes home.

494
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:13,079
Rym: dad comes home and you just see like his tattered arm Poking and he's like I need to shave.

495
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:17,160
Scott: Yeah, basically this is one point at which the dad gets sucked into another universe, right?

496
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,780
Scott: And you know the whole time you see, you know, the mom usually doesn't worry that much.

497
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:34,280
Scott: You know, I mean now how much can you worry when your husband is Superman, but you know, he's flying around You know the world saving people and stuff and he's not home all the time and he's always running off and you know But you get sucked into another dimension.

498
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,660
Scott: So then the mom is like I always worry when he gets sucked in another dimension and you see the mom being awesome Right, and then you're like, huh?

499
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,014
Scott: I wonder if they're gonna keep him sucked into that other dimension for how long?

500
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:46,420
Scott: and I wonder if he's ever gonna come back.

501
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,143
Scott: You know, are they gonna?

502
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:48,088
Scott: and I was like, huh?

503
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:50,700
Scott: If they had him die, that would be sort of obvious.

504
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:55,199
Scott: And then I'm like, oh they just had him show up, you know They're all and you know.

505
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,480
Scott: Then it would be also sort of lame though and it has brought him back at exactly the right time in a humorous fashion.

506
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:03,693
Rym: But the thing is other than that, I mean what else can I say?

507
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:04,115
Rym: It's funny.

508
00:31:04,135 --> 00:31:04,598
Rym: It's clever.

509
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:04,940
Rym: It's cute.

510
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:06,246
Rym: I don't know if I'd read anymore.

511
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:08,860
Rym: I think I already got everything I could ever get out of this kind of comic.

512
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,030
Scott: Well, this is this isn't the kind of comic right?

513
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,317
Scott: There's some comics like.

514
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:21,836
Scott: they're so great All right that you just run out and get all of them and you read them all straight through right invincible You know, I don't think I'm gonna run out and get them all and read them straight through.

515
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:23,659
Scott: that seems like that Seems like a bad idea.

516
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:31,686
Scott: But I mean if I was sitting around going like doo doo doo doo and I felt like just a fun comic, you know And I didn't have one available.

517
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:32,409
Scott: I might be like, huh?

518
00:31:33,173 --> 00:31:34,620
Scott: I could use something fun right now.

519
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,499
Scott: Maybe I'll go by the second one and see if it's it's as fun as the first one.

520
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:41,780
Rym: It doesn't have a lot of those little you know comic book cameos.

521
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,800
Rym: I mean the nerd that gets beat up in the beginning is clearly Steve Urkel and later on you see like Charlie Brown walking by.

522
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:49,304
Scott: Yeah, you know funny.

523
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:51,950
Scott: So it's just totally you know fun.

524
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,015
Scott: It's it's not serious.

525
00:31:54,256 --> 00:31:55,720
Scott: It's just kind of hey, what's up?

526
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:56,553
Scott: Totally cool.

527
00:31:57,643 --> 00:31:58,646
Rym: And say it's worth reading.

528
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:02,039
Rym: Yeah now Scott was amazed when I came back and said hey, I liked it.

529
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,955
Rym: Yeah, so we handed me this Marvel team up and said if you like that you like this right.

530
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:10,590
Scott: so Marvel team up is written By also what we're talking about.

531
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:10,811
Scott: There's.

532
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:12,680
Scott: no there's more than one Marvel team up here.

533
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:17,196
Scott: There's the old Marvel team up from way back in the day.

534
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:17,979
Scott: Don't read that.

535
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,291
Scott: There's a new Marvel team up.

536
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:21,660
Scott: It's relatively new.

537
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:33,122
Scott: it was from a few years ago right and You can buy it is in four trade paperbacks the whole series and it's also written by Robert Kirkman and it's sort of a fun Superhero book.

538
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:39,322
Scott: and the first I read the first two volumes and then it took a while before the third and the fourth volumes came out.

539
00:32:39,383 --> 00:32:41,558
Scott: so, you know, that's I sort of read it that way.

540
00:32:41,578 --> 00:32:52,606
Scott: and The first two volumes I think you know in my opinion They're a lot like invincible only they have Marvel superheroes instead of you know Original invincible superheroes.

541
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:59,510
Rym: see I guess the thing that I guess got me about is that on the surface that might seem true But if I read it, it's so.

542
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,460
Rym: it takes itself seriously.

543
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:09,880
Scott: I think in the starting around the the third volume is because the third volume is way different than the first and second.

544
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:16,563
Scott: Right, it sort of takes out this big tangent and then the fourth one sort of ties them together and kind of an airway It's just.

545
00:33:16,623 --> 00:33:16,724
Rym: it's.

546
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:20,620
Rym: so I don't know what I never really liked the whole the Marvel Universe.

547
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,240
Rym: There's a billion superheroes and they all know each other and there's a billion super villains.

548
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:35,711
Rym: I'll see that they all know each other and they all fight with each other and Like they fight a green guy and then someone who's news like is that the Hulk and spider-man is like no you dumbass That's so-and-so from such-and-such.

549
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:37,140
Rym: It's not the Hulk because of blah.

550
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,479
Scott: See, that's why I kind of like the more at least the first two volumes of this Marvel team-up is because it's sort of.

551
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:49,100
Scott: It takes the mark, you know normal Marvel Comics take themselves like 10,000 times more seriously, right?

552
00:33:49,540 --> 00:34:01,940
Scott: So it's just sort of like poking fun at you know, like it at the other Marvel Comics in a way But at the same time it's just having fun like it's like yeah, we don't need to worry about you know bullshit.

553
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:06,800
Scott: But it also it's sort of like a truth in advertising kind of thing, you know.

554
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,580
Scott: It's like you read another Marvel comic that takes itself so seriously, right?

555
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,772
Scott: but it doesn't make sense.

556
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:23,719
Scott: because like if Really you expect me to believe that all these serious comics what you're saying is right Then that means there must be like a bajillion superheroes flying all over New York all the time, but we don't see that.

557
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:26,770
Scott: So it's like the serious comic doesn't make sense.

558
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:34,199
Scott: So in this non serious Marvel team-up It's like they're just superheroes all over New York knowing each other as they should.

559
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:41,646
Scott: So it's it's sort of a weird thing and where yes, it takes itself less seriously yet somehow It makes more sense.

560
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:47,813
Scott: And that is that is why I find at least the first two volumes of it enjoyable Yeah, but at the same time I feel like it just takes itself too.

561
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:48,376
Rym: Seriously.

562
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:49,119
Rym: There's too much of that.

563
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:55,399
Rym: I'm a superhero giving my monologue before the other guy describes what he's about to do and then does it.

564
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:57,360
Scott: I don't really notice that so much.

565
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,182
Rym: There was a lot of.

566
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:04,320
Rym: there's a lot of needless exposition and expounding on the behalf of characters talking about what happened.

567
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,325
Rym: And well, I'm gonna do this.

568
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,640
Scott: a few things that did but I mean, it's not as it's not perfect.

569
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:10,248
Scott: I mean a few things that bothered me in.

570
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:12,600
Scott: it were like, you know, it's Marvel team-up, right?

571
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,557
Scott: So it's all about you know characters teaming up.

572
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:24,489
Scott: But really they should have just had it be spider-man teaming up with different people because it when spider-man leaves like that because the most Fun part of the book is spider-man wisecracking at everybody.

573
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:27,217
Scott: All right, I always think that's funny when it's written.

574
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:29,968
Rym: Well, yeah Wasn't that funny?

575
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:31,400
Rym: It was kind of pedestrian.

576
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:34,231
Scott: Well, I like his wisecrack and I also like how.

577
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:36,600
Scott: it's just sort of like, you know, his life is kind of rough.

578
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,091
Scott: It's like I'm gonna beat up some guys.

579
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:41,020
Scott: I dropped my donuts god damn it.

580
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:49,740
Rym: I just because a lot of the plot kind of behind that is so Serious compared to something like invincible where the way it was handled was a lot lighter.

581
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:55,898
Rym: I didn't I couldn't get into it at all and I find myself just glazing over these long long speeches.

582
00:35:55,938 --> 00:36:04,245
Rym: that people give Really notice that many long speeches going on like this kid here the kid who was the killer right in the beginning with his weird Power at the hands.

583
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:10,100
Scott: and all I thought I like I liked how when they revealed that that you know They give you this kid who's central to like the first story, right?

584
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:12,220
Scott: He's like a mutant and he's got crazy powers.

585
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:15,633
Scott: So they're trying to you know, like, you know, keep him from being too dangerous.

586
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:17,440
Scott: and you're like, oh, you know.

587
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,980
Scott: And at first it seems like he's innocent.

588
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,691
Scott: He doesn't realize he's all powerful and you know He's just sort of like a victim of his own mutant stuff.

589
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:25,500
Scott: and maybe they'll get him hooked up with the x-men.

590
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:25,761
Scott: It'll be.

591
00:36:25,842 --> 00:36:26,344
Rym: it was done.

592
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:28,616
Rym: Well when he's like you should look in the other rooms, too.

593
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:29,661
Scott: Yeah I like.

594
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:33,794
Rym: at the same time that was serious and the rest of it like it.

595
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:36,262
Rym: just it didn't fit with what I wanted I guess.

596
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:42,860
Rym: Oh, well, it's like there's an example of what I don't like about these Marvel superhero the comics with these team-ups and whatever.

597
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,772
Rym: Quoth Wolverine after a bunch of people were looking at him on the bus.

598
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:47,715
Scott: Yeah.

599
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:50,207
Scott: Yeah Wolverine on the bus I mean, come on was hilarious.

600
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:51,755
Scott: Come on Wolverine on the bus.

601
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,966
Rym: That was great And I was this guy.

602
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:56,718
Scott: that's that's the thing is like Wolverine can't fly, right?

603
00:36:57,341 --> 00:37:00,095
Scott: He doesn't have the blackbird or anything cuz he's nice in New York.

604
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:01,160
Scott: He's not in the new x-men.

605
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,757
Rym: She's also on everyone's teams who has to get around to like all these places.

606
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:05,260
Rym: all the right.

607
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,632
Scott: So, you know and that's what happens in a serious Marvel Comics.

608
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,840
Scott: So in his non serious one, right?

609
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:11,844
Scott: They take.

610
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:13,232
Scott: well, what would be true?

611
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:14,480
Scott: Wolverine would take the bus.

612
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:19,520
Scott: So it's like the thing that makes sense is humorous, especially because this one guy's looking at him.

613
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,989
Rym: He's like, what are you looking at?

614
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,076
Rym: It's healing already.

615
00:37:22,136 --> 00:37:33,025
Rym: Yeah Yep, but then he gets off the bus and he says all of the following in one speech bubble Frigging bolded tourists.

616
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:35,193
Scott: No, it does have some bolding in there.

617
00:37:35,273 --> 00:37:37,160
Rym: act like they'd never seen a superhero before.

618
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:41,080
Rym: I saw Nova fly by bolded twice while we were on the bus.

619
00:37:41,321 --> 00:37:42,424
Rym: This is bolded New York.

620
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:47,299
Rym: for Pete's sake you can't buy a bag without bumping into bolded speedball or bolded Darkhawk.

621
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,657
Rym: now Why?

622
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,160
Rym: Did he have to say all of that when he could have just said friggin tourists like these extra words?

623
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:00,360
Rym: I would bother me about superhero comics and - why did he have to name three proper nouns?

624
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:08,580
Rym: Superheroes, it's like they named these three superheroes Just to get the people who know the universe and like those three superheroes to go.

625
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,505
Rym: Ah, he said the name of the superhero.

626
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:13,895
Rym: I like it's anime-con name a Pokemon syndrome.

627
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:14,577
Scott: It does.

628
00:38:14,678 --> 00:38:15,400
Scott: it is in there.

629
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,324
Rym: I hate that.

630
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:20,080
Rym: like it stands out so shallowly and it bothers me so much.

631
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:20,942
Scott: Yeah I guess it.

632
00:38:21,062 --> 00:38:29,613
Scott: I guess it stands out a little less to me because if you read the really old comic books like you read Some Stan Lee's that is like times a billion.

633
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:31,862
Scott: so I know I don't read them I know.

634
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:34,478
Scott: so when you read this one you barely even notice it.

635
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:36,438
Scott: It's it's totally relative.

636
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:38,827
Scott: But yeah invincible you know is the same feeling.

637
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:42,680
Scott: only I guess it doesn't have that because it's not a Marvel or a DC book.

638
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:43,867
Rym: I don't know the only point.

639
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:50,839
Rym: I mean I read I'd like the first one for about 20 pages and I kind of phased out and I skipped the third one after trying to read it.

640
00:38:51,522 --> 00:38:57,858
Rym: And then the fourth one was I like the ring thing at the end when the guy cool guy has the ring And he does what any cool guy would do.

641
00:38:58,562 --> 00:39:00,628
Rym: But then they kind of superhero comic.

642
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:02,633
Rym: if I it and it goes nowhere.

643
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,516
Rym: I was interested in.

644
00:39:03,536 --> 00:39:07,690
Rym: there's all this epic Superhero crap and I yeah.

645
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:12,206
Scott: when they're like all out in the middle of nowhere and his giant bat Yeah, that was kind of a. I didn't like that.

646
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,049
Rym: none of that was like.

647
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:16,100
Rym: wow just superheroes and underwear perfect costumes fighting.

648
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:18,190
Rym: It's lost all the charm.

649
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:20,080
Rym: I don't care about all this plot.

650
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:22,447
Rym: Why is everyone so serious then?

651
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:26,018
Rym: at the very end they kind of redeem it with an okay joke.

652
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,386
Scott: yeah But I definitely think Marvel team up.

653
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:32,138
Scott: the first two volumes are where it shines and volume three is the crapper in.

654
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,995
Scott: volume four Is a little bit better than the crapper, but yeah, it's the same thing anyway.

655
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:37,978
Scott: Do you wanna tell anything else?

656
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:38,560
Rym: no?

657
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,482
Rym: I think we're done here.

658
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,887
Scott: That was pretty quick.

659
00:39:41,348 --> 00:39:41,890
Rym: Not really.

660
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,856
Rym: no no all right.

661
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:45,140
Rym: standard GeekNights episode.

662
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:48,360
Scott: Okay good thing else is I'll try I'll watch an anime for next week.

663
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,043
Scott: I guess all right.

664
00:39:49,063 --> 00:39:52,620
Scott: I don't know when though cuz he'd be doing this comic-con all weekend on the train.

665
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,879
Rym: That's how I watch all of like all these shows.

666
00:39:55,665 --> 00:39:57,740
Scott: Then I got to bring my optical drive.

667
00:39:58,122 --> 00:40:08,820
Scott: Yeah, well not for the fansubs bokurano and tokiwakakator shoujo And I don't have the fansubs for any of those again, but my I only have a flash drive in my laptop.

668
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:09,606
Scott: I can't fit them all.

669
00:40:09,747 --> 00:40:11,299
Rym: all of bokurano was like four gigs.

670
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:13,570
Scott: That's a lot.

671
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:14,699
Rym: take half at a time.

672
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,919
Rym: So hard to watch anime these days it takes so long to watch it, but it's good.

673
00:40:22,825 --> 00:40:27,959
Rym: You could watch an equal volume of comics in the same time And actually I can read really fast.

674
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:29,405
Scott: That's the thing plus.

675
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:31,494
Scott: You know it's like okay.

676
00:40:31,534 --> 00:40:32,860
Scott: I kind of want to watch bokurano.

677
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:35,584
Scott: I want to read the books I'm reading more.

678
00:40:35,604 --> 00:40:39,439
Rym: oh the bridge of nothing books that you wouldn't read for so long and now you're finally reading.

679
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:41,245
Scott: well Come on you keep.

Scott: instead now is later for that stuff?

684
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,500
Scott: You told me to watch months ago, so you're gonna have to wait months through.

685
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,699
Rym: I do you know instead of reading this and watching that you read things like Marvel team up.

686
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:01,727
Scott: I read that even way before.

687
00:41:01,747 --> 00:41:03,895
Rym: it's not that good wasn't worth it.

688
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:05,100
Scott: Yeah, it was good.

689
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,779
Rym: Avatar is much better than Marvel team up.

690
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:09,183
Rym: Objective scale.

691
00:41:09,284 --> 00:41:10,687
Scott: no no see the thing is.

692
00:41:10,707 --> 00:41:16,710
Scott: you tell me to watch and read and you know such and play more things Than I have time to do.

693
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:17,538
Scott: so they build up.

694
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:21,760
Scott: So you can't tell me to watch something and expect it to happen soon.

695
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:23,107
Scott: It's gonna happen eventually.
