1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,586
Rym: It's Wednesday July 30th.

2
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:12,509
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:19,800
Rym: I'm the baddest motherfucker in the world, and it's the juggernaut Tonight we talk about on GeekNights the surrogates.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,916
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:38,790
Rym: So the other day Emily and I were gonna watch some anime But we ended up running into a problem where either the soft subs wouldn't work.

6
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,893
Rym: I couldn't make him work.

7
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:40,776
Rym: so we gave up.

8
00:00:40,936 --> 00:00:42,100
Scott: you push J.

9
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:43,163
Rym: And it didn't work.

10
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:45,490
Scott: then you push pound sign didn't work.

11
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:48,549
Scott: Well, then that means the file is messed up.

12
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:50,094
Rym: Yeah There was something weird with it.

13
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:52,662
Scott: a lot of people have been getting worse at encoding lately.

14
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:58,827
Rym: and if there's a problem with those files Just yeah, cuz I tried to open it later in VLC, and it just wouldn't even open.

15
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:03,394
Rym: so yeah So it's a broken file deleted, but then you know all right What are we gonna watch?

16
00:01:03,434 --> 00:01:05,690
Rym: so I start patrolling through until I find something that works?

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,890
Rym: And I end up picking the first episode of the birdie the mighty remake birdie the mighty decode.

18
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:12,716
Rym: You know what.

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,955
Rym: it's pretty damn good And I really like it.

20
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:19,146
Scott: I watched one episode of the original, and it was so okay.

21
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:19,608
Scott: It was so.

22
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,314
Scott: so Here's the thing.

23
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:25,150
Rym: so I didn't watch some of those old-school like comedy action shows.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,884
Rym: And if you're looking for the comedy action show.

25
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:29,190
Scott: remake slayers revolution.

26
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:35,273
Rym: Huh you know what cuz there's been a distinct lack of good comedy action shows lately Maybe.

27
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:36,978
Rym: and I know I know something else.

28
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:40,990
Rym: cuz I realize something you know watching one birdie the mighty decode is really good.

29
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:45,470
Rym: I really enjoyed the first episode to a surprising degree and so did Emily.

30
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,076
Rym: It ended and we're like.

31
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:49,565
Rym: so I feel like I want to watch more of that.

32
00:01:49,605 --> 00:01:52,355
Rym: She's like yeah, me too Who would have thunk it?

33
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:55,810
Rym: uh-huh, but you know the birdie the mighty why?

34
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,733
Rym: I think what really made it stand out was that the humor With wasn't.

35
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:01,820
Rym: it seems like a lot of anime lately is really kind of.

36
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,127
Rym: the humor is expected and stereotypical and just.

37
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:05,250
Rym: I don't know.

38
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:17,630
Rym: Maybe it's just the tropes of the era, but I don't find it that funny, but a show like slayers They don't quite go the wacky anime humor where they just hit you with something out of the blue But they hit you with unexpected jokes at least occasionally.

39
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:25,270
Scott: Well the thing is they have their own set of slayers jokes that they made like they're in an inn that in ain't surviving.

40
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:26,478
Scott: It's not gonna happen.

41
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,752
Scott: You know it's not gonna happen But you know what.

42
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:34,190
Scott: it don't matter cuz you just got to see how it happened, or you know there's got to be a fish man.

43
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:42,590
Scott: But It doesn't matter cuz you could just put a fisherman on screen and instant funny.

44
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,600
Rym: I can point out one other thing though.

45
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:51,206
Rym: There's been a distinct lack of Interesting well choreographed action scenes in anime lately.

46
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:57,109
Rym: That's for sure I I've heard I mean we haven't watched enough black lagoon, but people have said that there are good action scenes in that.

47
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:59,256
Rym: and Birdie the mighty?

48
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:00,465
Rym: yeah, not you know.

49
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:09,502
Rym: a lot of shows lately They have the kind of slow pan action line slow pan pan of the face guy yelling Naruto all that stuff or Like a special move like in.

50
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,490
Rym: I don't know one piece.

51
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,355
Rym: This was some straight-up.

52
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:16,246
Rym: Just action anime, and it really made me nostalgic for some anime.

53
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:20,037
Rym: I used to watch when I was younger Speaking anime watching or younger.

54
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:27,690
Scott: I finished the escaflown a like a week or so ago man And I've been watching the Evangelion for the second time on the iPhone.

55
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,503
Rym: You're not I mean, I'm a huge escaflown a fan like.

56
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:33,430
Rym: I've seen this show like six times.

57
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:34,469
Scott: I've seen it two times.

58
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:42,075
Rym: So I gotta ask as someone who watched it once in marathon format at like the height of our anime fandom to Watching it again today.

59
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:43,961
Rym: You know older more sober more wise.

60
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:45,005
Rym: is that a good show.

61
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:47,134
Scott: Yeah, it's a good show I can't.

62
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:49,190
Scott: I don't know why you wouldn't want to watch that Joe.

63
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:50,355
Rym: Yeah, cuz I don't know.

64
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,163
Rym: it seems like it's getting a little bit of hate lately.

65
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:53,750
Scott: Why would it be getting hate?

66
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,292
Rym: I don't know.

67
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:59,147
Rym: It's I consider one of the best shows ever made Not top three, but definitely top ten.

68
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:04,346
Rym: no movies Can't count movies because it's this whole different ballgame.

69
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:23,170
Scott: definitely I mean unlike the pretty much It's like it was weird because I watch a new anime right and I watch an episode and I might continue to watch episodes And that's alright, but with escaflown I watched the episode and I actually had an incredibly strong desire to watch the next episode

70
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:30,272
Rym: Because when a show like that's happening you'll be almost done with an episode on the train and you'll be pissed that you're home Yep,

71
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:34,545
Scott: or I'll be like trying to get out of work and turn it on as quick as I can.

72
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:40,125
Scott: But anyway, I Got the same issue going on with the evangelical perhaps even more so.

73
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:41,530
Scott: it's like I. you know.

74
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:48,150
Scott: I understand like in my mind why people are sort of you know, some people like evangelical and some people don't.

75
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:51,749
Scott: But I'm pretty sure the people don't are just morons.

76
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,814
Scott: Evangelion I'm watching that again.

77
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:57,726
Scott: I mean if escaflown is a top ten show watching Evangelion again.

78
00:04:57,746 --> 00:05:00,456
Scott: I Think I just got to say flat-out.

79
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,284
Scott: It's the number two show behind cowboy Viva.

80
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:03,730
Rym: I think I have to agree.

81
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:09,350
Scott: I mean, I mean on my iPhone with this incredible shitty video quality.

82
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:14,069
Scott: This thing is better animated than any anime I've seen.

83
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:25,415
Scott: Except you know not counting movies and such like, you know Not counting like a Satoshi con or a studio for see you're in a cure or anything like that or the big brudgeon things like Standalone complex is pretty damn.

84
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:25,937
Rym: Well anime.

85
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:27,823
Scott: I think Evangelion is better animated.

86
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:28,886
Scott: the standalone complex.

87
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:30,639
Rym: Well, you know, I can say one thing There is problem.

88
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,572
Rym: There's more Detail.

89
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:33,114
Rym: that matters.

90
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:37,510
Scott: and even maybe if Evangelion was made today with all the CG would look like standalone complex.

91
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:40,280
Scott: but I think I like Evangelion.

92
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:47,806
Scott: I think the way it looks is bad not just the way it looks like I Watch an episode and I am desperate to watch the remainder.

93
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:48,910
Scott: Well, it's like right now.

94
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,880
Scott: I could just stop doing this and go keep watching.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,342
Scott: Let me out.

96
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:52,890
Scott: and this is on a tiny iPhone.

97
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:55,890
Scott: It looks better than all these other shows do on television.

98
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:01,930
Rym: I think part of it is that a lot of people it seems like there's this whole kind of subculture of anime fans who?

99
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:13,852
Rym: They feel like they have to hate on whatever shows are popular or were popular or were popular in the past in order to I don't know be hip I don't get it because I Under.

100
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:14,959
Rym: I mean there are flaws.

101
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,850
Rym: Ava's not a perfect show by any stretch.

102
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:24,990
Rym: It has its flaws, but most of the complaints people have basically boiled down to where it's actually deep or where?

103
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,915
Rym: I don't understand it.

104
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:27,507
Rym: So I say it's just pretentious.

105
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:37,810
Scott: Yeah All right there are some things you could say about the end but I'm like 14 episodes in at this point and It doesn't matter if the end sucks.

106
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:43,710
Scott: Those are 14 of the best Animated 20-minute episodes that have ever been created in the entire history of the world.

107
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:50,949
Rym: I think it's fair to also say that you you if you take step out from the you know Enjoyment of the show or the message of the show.

108
00:06:51,691 --> 00:06:58,407
Rym: I'm totally okay with you saying that I know pulled a crap move by saying to all of his fans are our kids.

109
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,850
Rym: I Couldn't come up with a good way to end this and I had something to say.

110
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:05,607
Rym: I tricked y'all into watching my show with giant robots.

111
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:15,350
Rym: now I'm gonna lecture at you for two episodes But at the same time I feel as though the lecture was good enough and the message was good enough to almost justify that.

112
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,343
Scott: Well, it's it's easily it.

113
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:28,486
Scott: you can easily Justify the original ending, you know artistically But it's hard to justify it from an entertainment factor that the other episodes do have.

114
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:32,219
Rym: see what the one thing I can say Those that the it really hit.

115
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:41,528
Rym: I mean, I remember watching the end of Ava the first time and I think it was good the way it ended that way because it really hits you over the head with.

116
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:51,467
Rym: you know the show kind of ends episode 24 and Then you see these hints of like what happened in the real world and they're kind of like they come and go and then you Get this whole kind of.

117
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:56,447
Rym: well Here's what the point of the show was and here's everything we were trying to say and that I'll admit.

118
00:07:56,487 --> 00:08:01,193
Rym: I kind of I cried At the end, you know the clapping and all that business Just fun.

119
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,300
Scott: the whole show clap clapping wide.

120
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,546
Rym: Yeah, who's clapping for who and for what?

121
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:06,630
Scott: cut for your mom?

122
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,393
Rym: But the one dt.

123
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:23,773
Rym: I cried at the end there because I think the way the end was put together was just so absolutely perfect, but anyway There reason you're doing that dt Dt.

124
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,369
Scott: I don't know what was that?

125
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:28,274
Rym: Song song from.

126
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:31,344
Rym: were you trying to do the the song from the movie?

127
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:35,749
Scott: You know what song I'm doing tumbling down Maybe maybe maybe didn't come through.

128
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:38,140
Scott: Anyway, it sounded right to me.

129
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:49,966
Rym: You know what all we have to do I realize is take the end that the show end of Ava and the non-crazy parts of the movie end of Ava and cut them together into the actual end of Ava is

130
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:53,710
Scott: the other thing is the Last thing I want to say about the eventually before we get on with this, right?

131
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,474
Scott: I've seen the show.

132
00:08:54,695 --> 00:09:01,340
Scott: once I was watched all the VHS is sort of one at a time Like once a week or so and then I watched again.

133
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:17,726
Scott: all the VHS is in a marathon and this is only the third time I'm watching the whole thing and it's been at least five years since I've seen the whole thing and I'm watching on I guess DVDs converted to iPhone format and There is absolutely nothing so far in 14 episodes.

134
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:22,764
Scott: that is not Crystal-clear and absolutely obvious, but the thing is is a lot of that.

135
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:24,570
Scott: You just have to pay the fuck attention.

136
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:26,769
Rym: I mean, I remember a scene in particular where?

137
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:33,502
Rym: Cod suddenly like Haji's like ah shit See ya and he flies away at Harrier.

138
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:35,510
Rym: Yeah, and he's got that thing in that briefcase.

139
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:43,562
Scott: Yep there's some things in the show that someone will say something very quickly or there'll be a scene that was very short and Or they'll be.

140
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:48,463
Scott: you know They'll be like a literally like a five-second scene like at the end of an episode.

141
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:52,799
Scott: and if you don't remember that you'll be a little confused.

142
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:13,550
Scott: and because you know the The sort of the context of what's going on in any given episode changes pretty rapidly like you won't piece things together between sort of when they're happy hanging out drinking in the apartment or When they're fighting and monster in the robots and when they're talking all serious business.

143
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:17,647
Scott: Well, you know like you're more with this weird stuff going on.

144
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,430
Scott: It's all secret.

145
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:29,484
Scott: Ooh, you really it's you have to connect all those things in your mind and keep all the context, you know consciously thinking about them in order to get what's going on, but it's not hard.

146
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:33,898
Rym: plus when I think about it Ava what it did is it did something that actually a newer show.

147
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,764
Rym: Bocorano also did really well.

148
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:44,694
Rym: where there's this a Real or crazy thing is happening, you know and Ava it's God is coming down to kick your ass humans It's the end of the world.

149
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:56,528
Rym: Yeah, but it's literal like it is literally happening and Here are real people dealing with it and The fact that people don't always cope with things like that so well and Bocorano did that in the same way.

150
00:10:56,608 --> 00:11:02,443
Rym: it adds this Really kind of I don't know having normal characters and a perfectly real setting.

151
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:07,315
Rym: but yet the context beyond that is something Absolutely crazy.

152
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,630
Rym: but yet people same people have to deal with it in a sane manner.

153
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:19,110
Scott: Yeah, and even though there's things people don't know and there are things you don't know I mean, you know that like it's the end of the world here, right?

154
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:28,507
Scott: if they if they fail is game over and that's all your and everyone knows that and it's like Wow, but they're more concerned of these other things and you know, it's just.

155
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,906
Scott: you know They don't say it too often, but you have to keep that in mind.

156
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:34,157
Rym: Anyway, yeah We're not gonna turn this into the Ava.

157
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:36,750
Rym: should I feel like we need to do a show someday in the future?

158
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:37,094
Rym: I don't know.

159
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:38,529
Rym: Ava teach the controversy.

160
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:45,050
Scott: We gotta do some Ava something cuz I. I just feel like everyone else seems to shy away from the evangelical.

161
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:46,515
Scott: I'm not shy cuz I.

162
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:54,005
Rym: I still I feel as though Ava gets a bad rap among people who either didn't understand it Saw it once a long time ago or like hate not it.

163
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:56,520
Scott: Yep Misconceptions about it.

164
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:00,221
Rym: I've never seen it Yeah, and granted a lot of some of that is justified.

165
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:02,730
Rym: for example, oh no a little bit crazy.

166
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:03,817
Scott: Well, yeah, it's.

167
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:04,824
Scott: it's you know, crazy.

168
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:09,321
Scott: people make good things But at the same time it's like drugged up.

169
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,229
Scott: people make good things sometimes.

170
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:14,203
Rym: Remember when they put those spiders on acid.

171
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:19,250
Scott: they did not make good webs No, but they made much more awesome to look at webs.

172
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:35,850
Scott: So anyway this coming weekend this weekend the end of July the beginning of August as in August 1 2 3 in Hartford Connecticut and the Hartford convention Connecticut Convention Center, I don't know what it's the only convention center in Hartford.

173
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:39,805
Scott: Well, I guess I guess the Hartford Civic Center is no more, right?

174
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:44,684
Rym: So, I don't know I don't know anything about can and it's connected to a Marriott connected Connecticut.

175
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:45,206
Rym: I see it.

176
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:46,350
Rym: go into the know.

177
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:48,056
Scott: It's all 84.

178
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:53,076
Rym: So we are going to be at Connecticut, which is a fun anime con We've attended for the last.

179
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:54,363
Scott: that's not really an anime con.

180
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:56,519
Scott: It's sort of a general geek You know what?

181
00:12:56,963 --> 00:13:05,050
Rym: I'll put it this way It has all the trappings of an anime con, but it is actually an anime web comics geek con.

182
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:10,790
Scott: Yeah, it's got anime web comics video gaming tabletop gaming sort of in relatively equal parts.

183
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:23,179
Scott: but in the dealer's room, you'll find mostly anime and manga I guess in proportion to other things and The kind of people who go there tend to be more The anime manga type.

184
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,777
Scott: it feels like in a small anime convention but it has everything going on.

185
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:33,494
Scott: like there are old guys who will come and play Warhammer the whole time and That you that's all they'll do.

186
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:39,113
Rym: see it's a con where you walk into any given part of the con and it's basically a completely Different con.

187
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:41,364
Rym: like you walk into the gaming side and it's just.

188
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:51,863
Rym: you might as well beat over con but then you walk out and you see cosplayers and then you go into the panel area and it's all web comics and you go The dealer's room and it feels like an anime con dealer's room.

189
00:13:52,244 --> 00:13:53,950
Scott: Yeah, but then there's a couple guys in there.

190
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:56,430
Scott: There's like web comics in there that are selling their stuff.

191
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,363
Scott: And there's also you know a few things in there that don't fit like.

192
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:00,910
Scott: there's a comic book store that's set up in there.

193
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,419
Scott: You're like, huh?

194
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:03,449
Scott: Story set up in here.

195
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:03,952
Rym: What do you think?

196
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:07,089
Rym: a net account has always been really good about and I always want to give him props for this.

197
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:07,290
Rym: is that?

198
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:08,880
Rym: They are real.

199
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,370
Rym: They always let us experiment.

200
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:18,350
Rym: Well, you know we do all these panels and all these cons But Connecticut is kind of where we test-drive all of our new panels and some panels have died there.

201
00:14:18,993 --> 00:14:19,628
Rym: They're sad.

202
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:23,182
Rym: Rightful deaths at Connecticut never to be released to the public.

203
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:25,450
Scott: Well a challenge run fire should have had that fate.

204
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:27,480
Scott: Yes, I said it should have but you didn't.

205
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,413
Rym: you didn't let it be kept striking it with lightning But it's you did.

206
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:35,350
Scott: I was I was just trying to shovel it into the ground and you were busy with your Frankenstein action.

207
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:37,035
Rym: It's still good.

208
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:37,639
Rym: It's still good.

209
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:38,424
Rym: Right?

210
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:45,630
Rym: So, uh We're doing as always quite a few panels but not nearly as many as we did last year, that's good.

211
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:47,897
Rym: So yes, I'm not gonna bother with the times.

212
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:48,720
Rym: I'll tell you this though.

213
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:52,030
Rym: Every panel we are doing is going to be on Saturday.

214
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,636
Rym: So if you really want to see us.

215
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:57,128
Rym: do panels come on Saturday, we're doing the anime magic game.

216
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:07,856
Rym: in the morning I do an anime You should see we're doing how to run an anime club Which if you've ever seen the anime club summit or how we've run this as other places We run it completely differently.

217
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:13,010
Rym: Akatsuka Akatsuka at Connecticut, yep, it's it's a balls to the wall.

218
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,598
Rym: Here's exactly how to do it.

219
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:16,930
Rym: We don't let the audience talk because no one knows what they're doing.

220
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:20,830
Rym: Yep, we're doing beyond Dungeons & Dragons the first time.

221
00:15:21,474 --> 00:15:25,453
Rym: This is the one that we're gonna be running at the penny arcade Expo Test around.

222
00:15:25,473 --> 00:15:31,229
Rym: a little test run and of course we are doing the GeekNights late night guest interview.

223
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,623
Rym: now This one is special because I think they were in a hurry to get the con book out.

224
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:42,381
Rym: the description of this event basically is The text that I wrote to them in suggesting the panel unedited.

225
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:45,690
Rym: So it basically says yeah, we've done this panel before.

226
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,573
Rym: It's pretty easy.

227
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:48,340
Rym: We just need you to provide as a guest.

228
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,564
Rym: if you can't provide one.

229
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:51,030
Rym: I know a noth will be there.

230
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,573
Rym: He's our friend.

231
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:53,361
Rym: we could interview him, you know Apple Geeks and all that.

232
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:55,330
Scott: That's literally what it says in the con book.

233
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,909
Scott: That's what we wrote in the email to them and they copied and pasted that into the con book.

234
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:05,450
Scott: Not so professional ConnectiCon this is why you're our like sandbox if we don't take you seriously.

235
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,190
Scott: If you want us to take you seriously, maybe you shouldn't you know be a little more professional.

236
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:13,306
Rym: But at the same time I still gotta ask enough, but I'm sure he'll do it.

237
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:14,370
Rym: So you might get to see us.

238
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,015
Scott: He'll be there.

239
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:17,915
Scott: Yes, he'll be there I imagine.

240
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:26,310
Rym: actually if you come to the GeekNights guest interview on Saturday night It is going to be a very informal very awesome roundtable with a lot of really cool people.

241
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:34,210
Rym: Probably if not, if nothing else, it'll be us talking to you So whatever or we'll just talk to enough and you'll all get to sit there and watch.

242
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,210
Scott: Yeah, another thing is that a lot of the panels there?

243
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:46,130
Scott: I mean the anime match game will probably be loaded but the vast majority of the panels you're on there have very low attendance Except not because I accept how to run an anime club, which was like standing in your room.

244
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,201
Scott: Oh, yeah, and it's not because of anything wrong with us.

245
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,747
Scott: It's just that's the way the con is.

246
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:51,168
Scott: There's not.

247
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:55,866
Rym: you know What's this making the pre-hoc anti trash talk right?

248
00:16:55,987 --> 00:16:56,408
Scott: It's true.

249
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:56,850
Rym: What's this?

250
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,894
Rym: You're like, oh just in case you show up and no one's at our panel It is nothing.

251
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:02,482
Scott: but we'll be at the panel no matter what.

252
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:05,782
Scott: even if there's only one person there We still run the panel because that's what we're doing.

253
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:06,628
Scott: We're testing the panel.

254
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:09,383
Scott: Yeah, as long as we have an audience of one person.

255
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,849
Scott: We don't know it's enough to test it out.

256
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,244
Rym: But anyway, I just want to point out that we're running some pretty good panels.

257
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:18,229
Rym: also Katsunori Matsushita is going to be there.

258
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:22,170
Rym: I didn't look at the schedule when but he should be running kendo workshops and a kendo panel.

259
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:22,869
Rym: But who knows?

260
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,318
Rym: The con might have screwed up the scheduling on that.

261
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,623
Rym: so I can't promise anything.

262
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,035
Scott: and the rest of the time when we're not Doing panels.

263
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:31,249
Scott: We're gonna be in the game room gaming it up.

264
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:42,104
Rym: Yes Saturday and Sunday the a portion of the front row crew our kind of staff will be in the game room at the GeekNights' table Running all sorts of game demos burning wheel German board.

265
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:48,570
Scott: Yeah, we'll be in there on Sunday But we have associates who will be in there possibly Friday and definitely Saturday.

266
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:49,590
Scott: Well, we're doing panels.

267
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,350
Rym: You want us to teach you how to play a German board game and not just teach you the rules but teach you how to win.

268
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:56,970
Scott: Yeah, and also burning wheel.

269
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:05,636
Rym: Yes if you are if you if you're curious what this burning wheel business that we've been going on and on and on and on about for like the last two years This is the place.

270
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,319
Scott: come to Connecticut and you know even if we're not there somehow something goes wrong.

271
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,777
Scott: the people who run the gaming room at Connecticut are like The best there.

272
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:17,530
Scott: there are kind of people Connecticut is like that.

273
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,474
Scott: They like age of steam.

274
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:18,876
Scott: we don't.

275
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:22,230
Scott: Connecticut is like an but they taught us to play age of steam away.

276
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:25,428
Rym: Actually, I like age of steam, but I don't like playing it.

277
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,880
Scott: Hey, that means I don't like it, but I like the concept.

278
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,503
Rym: cuz think about it.

279
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:31,636
Rym: I've always said man I hate games with ketchup mechanisms.

280
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:33,885
Rym: I want it to be hardcore like an initial.

281
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,250
Scott: That's the opposite of a ketchup.

282
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:47,730
Rym: Yes, like you know initial D. I always turn off the boost, but then I played age of steam Which is possibly there's a turning off the boost and turning on me be turning on the you know engine slowly dies.

283
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,435
Rym: Mechanism not the engine slowly dies.

284
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:55,855
Rym: It's the the game just starts raping you the console itself just drats you down great All right now.

285
00:18:56,177 --> 00:19:03,410
Rym: I don't we're turning this into the con schedule like we've talked about a lot But you know we're on summer sabbatical, so we're not doing as many shows as usual.

286
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:10,575
Rym: So I think we should talk about what we're doing the weekend after Connecticut so the week Directly after Connecticut.

287
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:11,318
Rym: oh god.

288

Scott: I'm only gonna be working Monday Tuesday Wednesday because on Thursday We're driving down to be more for the annual.

289
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,134
Scott: Oh taken man Oh - can.

290
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,149
Rym: it's because you know the the story of our con going was pretty much.

291
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,822
Scott: I've been - Oh taken since - oh -

292
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:29,174
Rym: in 2002 Scott And I went

293
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:31,550
Scott: this isn't gonna be the sixth or seventh Oh taken

294
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:35,001
Rym: Ohio con - which was and we'd

295
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:37,348
Scott: never been to an end of the seventh oh - out of kind of event and

296
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:43,770
Rym: we were like And everyone told us all these stories like oh my god this anime convention is going to be the best thing ever.

297
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:50,509
Rym: We got there and it was so lame that I thought the anime con circuit was crap and everyone was lying and I was so jaded.

298
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:54,185
Rym: and Then we were like all right if we're gonna go to one.

299
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:55,961
Rym: Let's go to one more Let's try the big ones.

300
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,488
Rym: we went to Otakon and good god.

301
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:11,610
Rym: Yeah, it's always been this kind of rite of passage among people who we met who were anime fans Who had never been to an anime con to get them to Otakon Take them into the dealer's room and watch their reaction to how large it is.

302
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,730
Scott: The thing is that reaction is much diminished now that the internet is much better.

303
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:24,909
Scott: Back in those days and you couldn't get anime anything, you know - and now and you saw that dealers room It was just like pee your pants.

304
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,163
Scott: Nowadays that dealers room doesn't have a lot of stuff.

305
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:29,490
Scott: You can't get more easily.

306
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:39,821
Scott: So it's not so exciting but just seeing the size of one of those the dealers room and then someone Tells you the artists alley is half that size.

307
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:42,490
Scott: Oh and the video game room is also half that size.

308
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:45,410
Scott: Oh, and there's like 20 other rooms that are all this size.

309
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:53,009
Rym: In any tradition of every Otakon since the first we were once again not paying for Otakon.

310
00:20:53,050 --> 00:21:04,557
Rym: now We said before we're doing some panels But we're actually now doing due to a very long series of circumstances five panels Five panels.

311
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:05,019
Rym: Yes.

312
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,162
Scott: We were originally I did seven at ConnectiCon So I'm doing almost as many Otakon panels as I was doing.

313
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:21,280
Rym: luckily one of these panels We don't have to do crap for because one of them is Katsu's Katsunori Matsushita's Kendo way of the sword All right, so that doesn't actually count.

314
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:21,803
Scott: all that has.

315
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,190
Scott: I mean it does for awesomeness.

316
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:31,858
Rym: That one is film it but you can handle and I'm gonna be on stage to Fulfill my obligation to the RIT Kendo.

317
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:32,901
Scott: Are you gonna do that?

318
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:34,747
Rym: It's undefeated vice president.

319
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:35,690
Rym: I have to be defeated.

320
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:45,278
Rym: I will see it better and but in addition I'm probably gonna be up there and like Stan, you know with the armor on so we can demonstrate stuff and Katsu does a pretty damn good kendo panel.

321
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,890
Scott: Yep, but also on Friday, I don't know who could do a better one.

322
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,151
Scott: I mean, maybe if there was like maybe Katsu's dad maybe but Maybe.

323
00:21:53,694 --> 00:21:56,790
Rym: so, uh, we're doing three panels on Friday at Otakon.

324
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:06,930
Scott: Oh, I guess that's good because then you know like it cuz Friday Usually it's like dealers rooms not open and you know artists Allie's not fully set up yet and there's not a lot of action.

325
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:07,917
Scott: So I'm doing panels.

326
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,670
Scott: Friday is a good day to do them at Otakon.

327
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:16,453
Rym: So Friday noon anime you should see which as you know that that one's like so easy and done and awesome Like.

328
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:17,730
Rym: it's got a really good reception.

329
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:23,554
Scott: If you already know about a lot of anime and you listen to our show you probably don't need to go to that panel Unless you just want to see us.

330
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:27,170
Scott: Yes the panels for people who think they're like, you know, the Naruto.

331
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,014
Scott: It's like they like.

332
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:31,970
Scott: they like Naruto and maybe they like Dragon Ball, but they don't really know anime.

333
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,757
Rym: Yeah, I mean think about it nowadays.

334
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:36,990
Rym: So you get into anime you like, you know, I know what's on TV.

335
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:44,077
Rym: Yeah I watched dumb stuff when I was a kid and until someone told me the RT anime Club was like hey Watch this show called cowboy.

336
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:46,586
Scott: be like kids these days don't even know what eskaplona is.

337
00:22:46,707 --> 00:22:48,769
Rym: and I was like cowboy Bebop, that sounds stupid.

338
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:55,250
Rym: And then someone else was like, yes, you know, it's the episode where spike fights vicious.

339
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:57,990
Rym: I'm like, oh so it's some stupid fighting show with stupid names.

340
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:07,950
Rym: But then at three we were running comics for the manga reader, oh, I didn't prepare anything for that panel.

341
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,818
Scott: Is that gonna be an off-the-cuff panel?

342
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,349
Rym: I think we're gonna have some slides for that when I'm working on it.

343
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:17,090
Rym: all right, but we should just Bring a copy of each one of those comics.

344
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:25,010
Rym: We should just pick out like ten comics that manga readers should read and then yes again If you're if you listen to our show, you probably don't need to go to that one.

345
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:31,893
Rym: We're gonna tell people to read, you know Dark Knight Returns watch them in V for Vendetta that sort of thing Fables.

346
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:35,150
Rym: Yeah, oh, you know because you know a lot of manga readers.

347
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:42,137
Rym: They seem to issue anything American comic assuming that They issue it so much.

348
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,386
Scott: it's that they just really don't know it's.

349
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:45,230
Scott: they go to borders.

350
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:50,684
Scott: They look at the manga shelf Which is nice and neat and easy to look at right and then there might be.

351
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:52,190
Scott: there is there is a u.s.

352
00:23:52,290 --> 00:24:03,830
Scott: Graphic novel shelf or at least a non manga graphic novel shelf, but it's a big mess and it's confusing and it's mostly superheroes Which aren't very enticing and they don't take the time to look through it and really get to know it or anything.

353
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:10,957
Scott: They don't know anything about it and it's more expensive than the manga in an unfamiliar Uneconomical format that doesn't fit on the shelf.

354
00:24:11,057 --> 00:24:16,016
Scott: So they're not really enticed by that and they don't go to a comic book store They only go to borders.

355
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:16,357
Scott: So they don't.

356
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,406
Scott: they don't know but they like manga.

357
00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:19,370
Scott: They like comics.

358
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,877
Scott: They read all kinds of web comics.

359
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,390
Scott: It's just they don't know to read the Watchmen.

360
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:25,521
Scott: They don't know to read Dark Knight Returns.

361
00:24:25,702 --> 00:24:27,130
Scott: I mean, they don't know to read the runaway.

362
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:28,922
Rym: I wouldn't have known to read the Dark Knight Returns.

363
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:30,572
Scott: I don't know the people's exist They don't.

364
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:34,910
Scott: they might not even know the Scott Pilgrim exists if it wasn't, you know on the shelf next to the manga by accident.

365
00:24:35,731 --> 00:24:46,336
Rym: So, uh, and then last and possibly least on Saturday morning now The deal was basically we were gonna do one panel and then they were like, oh, all right We need can you guys do two panels, please?

366
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:50,370
Rym: We're like, okay, and then they're like, uh, yeah one thing led to another.

367
00:24:50,471 --> 00:24:53,125
Rym: Can you guys do an advanced wars panel?

368
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:53,870
Rym: Cuz that's one of the things.

369
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:58,650
Rym: Basically, that was a panel that I put in to do it like an edacon and test.

370
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,877
Rym: Do you have something we could build up?

371
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,150
Rym: and then silly good generic easy fun panel?

372
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,119
Rym: But we decided not to do it anywhere.

373
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:06,690
Rym: then Otakon is like, yeah, we're desperate for more panelists.

374
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:07,836
Rym: Can you do that panel?

375
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:09,465
Scott: and I would rather do a different panel.

376
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:13,638
Rym: So I was like, uh Listen, that's not our strongest offering.

377
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:17,130
Rym: We'd rather do this other one called comics for the manga reader.

378
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:22,242
Rym: Wait, yes, so he's like, uh, could you do both?

379
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:26,599
Rym: and I was like, uh, Yeah Do you need any more?

380
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,285
Rym: He's like, yes.

381
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:31,021
Rym: Okay We can do the kendo panel that we did last year.

382
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:31,382
Rym: fine.

383
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:33,070
Scott: What about the know your creators panel?

384
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:34,839
Rym: Well, we're doing that.

385
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:43,290
Rym: Friday night Great Scott did most of the groundwork for this panel, but I think it's gonna be fantastic.

386
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,029
Rym: We're gonna test it.

387
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,237
Scott: Of course This is the panel that we worked hard on.

388
00:25:46,297 --> 00:25:49,890
Scott: the know your creators panel because people they watch the animes and read the mangas.

389
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,730
Scott: But I don't pay attention to who is the real people making this stuff, you know.

390
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,210
Scott: And it wasn't until I watch listen to the Admiral d'Or that I paid attention.

391
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,385
Scott: So it's basically like hey pay attention to who the director is asshole.

392
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,147
Scott: It's important.

393
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:02,750
Scott: and here's why.

394
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:03,773
Scott: Here's who.

395
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,579
Scott: it is just in case because you didn't check.

396
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:16,325
Rym: and just so you're all aware there is on Friday also right before one of our panels a Podcasting for dummies panel and I'm really curious who's running it.

397
00:26:16,426 --> 00:26:16,827
Scott: I don't know.

398
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:21,922
Scott: didn't the Taku generation people do something like that last year.

399
00:26:21,942 --> 00:26:22,825
Scott: I don't know.

400
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:23,990
Scott: I think they did.

401
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,577
Scott: The you know podcasting.

402
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:35,942
Scott: too many people on the the diet diet days Too many people on the days at podcasting panels at the same time.

403
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:36,524
Scott: Remember that?

404
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,728
Rym: Yeah, that was that wasn't?

405
00:26:37,748 --> 00:26:38,330
Rym: that was okay?

406
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:39,975
Scott: Yeah, I'm not doing.

407
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,058
Scott: I'm not doing that again.

408
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:46,795
Scott: for now on there'll be no more than three people on any days that I'm on A panel for yes.

409
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:48,580
Rym: Well, I could see a match game.

410
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:49,524
Rym: But then again, they're all.

411
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:50,407
Scott: guess they're not.

412
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:51,997
Scott: that's not a panel It's a game.

413
00:26:52,017 --> 00:27:00,090
Rym: and of course You you shouldn't need any provocation further to go to Otakon because Otakon is far and away the best anime con in America.

414
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:02,219
Rym: There's just no argument really.

415
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,685
Scott: No, there's the biggest is nothing.

416
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:04,830
Rym: It's the biggest that matters.

417
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:05,614
Rym: It's the best.

418
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:06,317
Rym: that's fun.

419
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:08,910
Rym: and they've got jam project among other acts.

420
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:13,990
Scott: How could you if you're with if you're able to go to Otakon, how could you not go?

421
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:23,370
Scott: I mean even if you just like anime or manga a little bit Why would you not go hell that the concert alone is probably worth the cost of admission.

422
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,505
Rym: How the artist alley is probably worth the cost of admission.

423
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:31,283
Scott: best artists alley Outside of comic-et and perhaps even better than that one.

424
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:32,448
Scott: it though not as big.

425
00:27:32,548 --> 00:27:34,817
Scott: Yep I think there's any other artists I've ever seen.

426
00:27:34,837 --> 00:27:38,350
Scott: I mean think about this right the Baltimore comic convention.

427
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,050
Scott: It's an entire comic convention.

428
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:47,430
Scott: It fits in one room at the Baltimore Convention Center one, you know convention room in the convention center.

429
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:53,175
Scott: Overflow with that convention on uses the entire Convention Center.

430
00:27:53,456 --> 00:28:01,830
Scott: so the artists arena sometimes and a club down the street The artists alley of Otakon is as big as the Baltimore comic convention.

431
00:28:03,077 --> 00:28:03,849
Scott: Take that as you will.

432
00:28:05,152 --> 00:28:11,642
Rym: And of course at the penny arcade expo, we're doing beyond dungeons dragons and at the New York Anime Festival We're doing four panels.

433
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:17,349
Rym: No And we've already got our tentative list of events for Katsucon.

434
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:18,816
Scott: February.

435
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:25,247
Rym: no, of course We'll be doing the usual awesome at Katsucon not being sick and we've already got some tentative rumblings.

436
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:27,779
Rym: at the New York Comic Con We're probably going to be running events again.

437
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,724
Scott: It's still July.

438
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:29,830
Scott: Don't talk to me about February.

439
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,118
Scott: We didn't run up events at New York comic.

440
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:32,721
Rym: We were pressed.

441
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:34,708
Scott: We just went in his press and we did nothing.

442
00:28:34,768 --> 00:28:35,958
Rym: this time There's a good chance.

443
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:39,070
Rym: We're gonna be running manga for the comics reader.

444
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:41,917
Rym: I don't want to run more than that.

445
00:28:41,997 --> 00:28:43,503
Rym: Actually, I'd rather be pressed at that time.

446
00:28:43,985 --> 00:28:47,468
Scott: Yeah, it's the kind of calm I don't want to hang around for a long time because it's not much going on.

447
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:58,170
Scott: And of course, we're going to have at Otakon the gigantic Otakon dealers room is bigger than the New York comic convention floor space.

448
00:28:58,853 --> 00:28:59,717
Rym: Think about that.

449
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:00,441
Scott: Think about that.

450
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:01,767
Rym: Think about that.

451
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:02,250
Scott: Think about that.

452
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:07,683
Rym: Okay, and of course we've got tables f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 f10 f11 j7 j8 and j9 in the artists alley.

453
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:17,270
Scott: All right, basically at Otakon when we're not doing something or we're not browsing around ourselves.

454
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:20,819
Scott: I think you know over 50% of the time.

455
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,842
Scott: the convention is open.

456
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:26,256
Scott: We'll be in the artists alley at our Artists alley conglomerate.

457
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:27,339
Rym: our table.

458
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:30,589
Rym: the one we will be sitting at with our stuff will be either f5 or f6.

459
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,713
Rym: I haven't decided yet.

460
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:32,736
Scott: It doesn't really matter.

461
00:29:32,756 --> 00:29:34,040
Rym: Nah, it doesn't matter.

462
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,070
Rym: It's not like you'll find f5 and be like where the hell are they?

463
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:37,985
Scott: I don't know.

464
00:29:39,394 --> 00:29:40,610
Scott: You will find us easily.

465
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:46,520
Scott: You can just go to the front artists alley table and say where's GeekNights and they'll say this table right there.

466
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,389
Rym: Man, this is gonna be a nutty couple of weeks.

467
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:52,741
Scott: I've already lost my nuts.

468
00:29:52,821 --> 00:30:02,228
Rym: So Right, so in other news, I just want to point out that Bakano got licensed and I think that's great because I think that's gonna be a great show.

469
00:30:02,248 --> 00:30:04,438
Scott: I only watched Yeah, why didn't someone license that sooner?

470
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,809
Scott: They said that there was like stupid things that were licensed before.

471
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:07,693
Scott: that It makes no sense.

472
00:30:07,713 --> 00:30:11,710
Scott: You don't want to know why I'll bet it's because the people I think don't know what the fuck they're doing.

473
00:30:11,991 --> 00:30:16,322
Rym: I'll bet they do know but the Japanese company had one of those.

474
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:17,425
Rym: you can't license that.

475
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:18,749
Rym: you can't license that.

476
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:21,335
Rym: yeah License it but you gotta wait.

477
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:28,930
Scott: Someone's got a muscle around these Japanese companies, you know, if you don't muscle them around You know, it's basically you have no choice.

478
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:33,566
Scott: if you do as they want you to do you're gonna go out of business because you're gonna be doing bad business.

479
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:41,550
Scott: if you You know muscle them around you have two options Succeed in business or not do business at all.

480
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,644
Scott: So you're not gonna muscle them around which is your only chance of succeeding.

481
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:48,095
Scott: don't do anything I think.

482
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:50,450
Scott: why can I resign yourself to failure?

483
00:30:50,791 --> 00:31:11,229
Rym: I think the time of muscling however is nigh because as you all know the anime industry in America is going down the pooper Without that whoop at the end, it's just So, uh as you know Properties and money dry up in the US and licensers go out of business or downsize and things go on.

484
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:18,070
Rym: The Japanese companies are gonna notice that the market in America is shrinking and that I mean look at having a Bandai visual.

485
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:20,316
Rym: Eventually, they're gonna realize wait a minute.

486
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:25,070
Rym: We're not selling anime over there anymore in that gigantic untapped market.

487
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:26,157
Rym: Why not?

488
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,930
Rym: and then when it's your fault?

489
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:42,830
Rym: so if there's only one licenser left in America or maybe two and that one licenser is the only chance you have of getting your new show released in the US other than doing it yourself and failing and they Want to negotiate?

490
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,469
Scott: You might have to negotiate.

491
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:49,515
Scott: Here's the problem the reason They'll pull a super gurry.

492
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:51,160
Scott: Yeah, pretty much as they have.

493
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:58,650
Scott: they had this very rigid way of thinking where you know Do having lower license prices or having reasonable?

494
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:00,152
Scott: You know Not.

495
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,779
Scott: stupid terms on the licenses and things like.

496
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:06,950
Scott: that is not even something they consider all they only considered things.

497
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,074
Scott: Outside of that they have.

498
00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:11,668
Scott: their mind is locked in that particular area and like changing.

499
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,829
Scott: that Seems to be something that is not it.

500
00:32:14,072 --> 00:32:16,854
Scott: It's like the act as if that's a. you know The way when you're doing.

501
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:20,106
Scott: it's like trying to invent something right if I'm trying to and make a machine.

502
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:23,459
Scott: I Just take the third law of thermodynamics.

503
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:26,110
Scott: In fact, all the laws of thermodynamics as a given, right?

504
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:26,892
Scott: I don't assume.

505
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:28,557
Scott: I don't try to think huh?

506
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:32,409
Scott: This would only work if I could break, you know that law of thermodynamics.

507
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:33,594
Scott: Let's go for it.

508
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:36,387
Scott: I think well, this is only I need to break the law of thermodynamics.

509
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:36,990
Scott: Can't do that.

510
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,349
Scott: I got to think of some other solution to them.

511
00:32:39,811 --> 00:32:44,890
Scott: Changing the way they do licensing is like a scientist or an inventor breaking law of thermodynamics.

512
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:45,815
Scott: They go, huh?

513
00:32:45,835 --> 00:32:47,203
Scott: We could change the licensing.

514
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:48,370
Scott: Oh, no, that's not possible.

515
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,509
Scott: We had to think somewhere else.

516
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:54,910
Rym: See I think part of the larger problem and I think anime world order mentioned this too But the fact that you look at look at OdaKan.

517
00:32:55,036 --> 00:33:08,690
Rym: All right The anime industry is tanking and yet OdaKan is gonna have twenty five thousand plus anime fans Spending gobs of money for an entire weekend mostly on merchandise But at the same time that but also on cheap DVDs cheap ones.

518
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:09,776
Rym: But here's the thing.

519
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:10,520
Rym: They don't look at that.

520
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,465
Rym: What they see is.

521
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:16,180
Rym: All right Buffy the Vampire Slayer doesn't get twenty five thousand fans.

522
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,031
Rym: Seinfeld doesn't get twenty five thousand fans in a building talking about Seinfeld There.

523
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,295
Rym: we can make money off of this.

524
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:25,485
Rym: Okay, these people are yes, but they don't think.

525
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:26,910
Rym: how do I make money off of it?

526
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,828
Rym: They think I'm going to make money off of it?

527
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,672
Scott: Well, they don't.

528
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:34,126
Scott: they do think how but their idea of how is wrong because they don't realize how.

529
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:39,966
Scott: these are poor high school kids No money, and they don't realize that you know, people don't want DVDs anymore.

530
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:45,309
Scott: People don't want drms They don't you know, they don't get the details right because yeah, they don't know there's.

531
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:50,756
Rym: I've said this before but I don't think Piracy has anything to do.

532
00:33:50,856 --> 00:34:03,070
Rym: all piracy did I think was speed up the demise of the end of the anime industry in the u.s by by maybe a year Maybe two because if all the if all the piracy disappeared, it's not like DVD sales would pick up.

533
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:07,110
Rym: Netflix might pick up but that's not enough money to run an industry.

534
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:11,563
Scott: I am confident that fan subs do not damage the anime industry.

535
00:34:11,603 --> 00:34:13,590
Scott: if someone is watching a fan sub Right.

536
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,918
Scott: Let's say someone's watching a fan sub of baka.

537
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:16,882
Scott: No right now, right.

538
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:21,141
Scott: if that fan sub wasn't there They wouldn't go out and buy the DVD.

539
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:22,569
Scott: They just wouldn't watch.

540
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:26,870
Scott: Someone who's gonna buy the DVD is gonna buy the DVD with or without the fan sub.

541
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:33,170
Scott: People watching the fan subs are people who would not watch anime if fan subs did not exist.

542
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,815
Scott: They just wouldn't watch at all.

543
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,342
Scott: So it's it's not the work.

544
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,310
Rym: It's like they're the people who would watch it on TV.

545
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:45,578
Rym: I mean, right I think the problem is that anime was treated as a special thing for a long time because it it was it was this Real treated special.

546
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,283
Rym: Well, that's the problem.

547
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:47,550
Rym: It was this really niche market.

548
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,478
Rym: So they used a business model that worked really well.

549
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,937
Rym: in that tiny niche market with that specific kind of fan base It gets segregated from other television.

550
00:34:55,956 --> 00:34:57,824
Scott: It's like they have they have an anime block.

551
00:34:58,105 --> 00:35:02,149
Scott: It's like oh, we'll put all the anime here Just put the anime in with the other TV shows.

552
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,193
Rym: But see that's the thing.

553
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:11,870
Rym: the anime industry in the US is still treating anime like it's this special market When it's actually gotten much more broad mainstream appeal.

554
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:20,234
Rym: But mainstream appeal doesn't mean anything because the mainstream is not going to go through the ropes of getting The content.

555
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:23,665
Rym: that if it's not just in the mainstream once anime is mainstream.

556
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:24,929
Rym: It's got to be on mainstream TV.

557
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:29,645
Rym: Mm-hmm, if it isn't mainstream people they're gonna say oh, it's that weird thing.

558
00:35:29,685 --> 00:35:31,250
Rym: I have to do the special blah blah blah.

559
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,177
Rym: I gotta buy a DVD box set to watch.

560
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:39,169
Scott: anime has to be on TV when kids get home from school And it has to be on TV.

561
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:44,230
Scott: You know along with all the other shows that people are watching at the same time.

562
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:51,649
Scott: People are home at like 9 o'clock So not at 1 in the morning not when everyone's at you know work.

563
00:35:52,513 --> 00:35:56,989
Scott: It has to be on when people get home and after dinner, so you got any anime news.

564
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,610
Scott: Okay, I got some comics news here.

565
00:35:59,650 --> 00:35:59,911
Scott: I cuz.

566
00:36:00,212 --> 00:36:08,463
Scott: oh by the way that lice that announcement of Baccano licensing was I believe is from the San Diego comic adventures last week Which we'll go to one day one day.

567
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:14,269
Scott: Yeah the problem Promised me to become Hollywood convention and not so much comic convention.

568
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:16,999
Rym: Yes I mean look it'd be like if we wanted to go to e3.

569
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:17,742
Rym: there'd be no point.

570
00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:19,127
Rym: We'll just go to PAX right.

571
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:24,929
Scott: so two important comics news is from the San Diego comic convention here.

572
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:27,530
Scott: The first one is that Viz.

573
00:36:28,632 --> 00:36:29,639
Scott: This is not a surprise.

574
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,050
Scott: We saw this coming a mile away.

575
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:35,630
Scott: But you know the last volume of monster by an okurasawa comes out in December.

576
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:39,990
Rym: It'll be done, and then maybe I didn't like the anime so much, but the manga looked a lot better.

577
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,541
Scott: Yeah, I might try buying the rest of the manga now.

578
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:43,003
Scott: that what?

579
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:47,302
Rym: now that I know it's gonna be finished in December But yeah, I didn't want to read further and then have it suddenly dry up.

580
00:36:47,462 --> 00:36:59,144
Scott: Yep now that that's done They announced and I think January February of course 20th century boys volume one will be out But also Pluto will be out from biz.

581
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:03,077
Scott: That's that's it Gotta be buying that guaranteed by you.

582
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:03,980
Scott: don't buy that you're stupid.

583
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:07,230
Scott: You don't buy both of those you stupid and the other news.

584
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:09,907
Scott: There's gonna be some more Batman comics.

585
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:13,356
Scott: Oh Hey, that's that's supposed to be news right this?

586
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:14,538
Scott: Batman comics every month.

587
00:37:14,578 --> 00:37:15,339
Scott: Why is that news?

588
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:15,620
Rym: oh?

589
00:37:16,873 --> 00:37:26,749
Rym: so up either they're really bad Batman comics, and you're about to make fun of them or They've got someone awesome to write and or draw.

590
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:32,230
Scott: ah Well these Batman comics that are going to be coming out.

591
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:44,666
Scott: I'm not gonna give you any details you can look it up But there are going to be in the future Batman comics available for buying and reading that are written by Someone with the first name Neil.

592
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:50,839
Scott: ha ha Yeah, cuz he's written so many comics.

593
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,585
Scott: It's Neil Armstrong.

594
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,270
Scott: Oh cuz he's alive.

595
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,326
Rym: Neil Adams.

596
00:37:57,412 --> 00:38:01,627
Rym: He did Batman comics already, so he's not doing these Batman, and he draws them.

597
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:04,559
Scott: He doesn't write though I don't think he writes them, but he's mostly draws them.

598
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,684
Rym: I said write or draw.

599
00:38:05,905 --> 00:38:07,552
Rym: I can't think of any more Neil's I know.

600
00:38:07,573 --> 00:38:08,579
Scott: oh, okay.

601
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,385
Scott: I guess I forgot.

602
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:09,969
Scott: Let's just go on.

603
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:19,685
Rym: So anyway things of the day now.

604
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:24,990
Rym: We've talked in the past about AMVs, and we've got a couple of shows about AMVs.

605
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:31,388
Rym: We interviewed Jeff to Tarik a long time ago talked about AMVs But I got something a little bit different for you right now.

606
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:35,324
Rym: You see AMVs are old-school pass a. I'm done with them.

607
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:36,750
Rym: for now on it's nothing.

608
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:41,065
Scott: But jam V's for me and jam V's those Jewish music videos.

609
00:38:41,346 --> 00:38:42,189
Rym: no no no no no.

610
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:47,006
Scott: Japanese music videos not even close, New Jersey music video.

611
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:50,768
Rym: these are in fact Juggernaut music video bitch.

612
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:54,928
Rym: It's a problem.

613
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:07,889
Scott: Yeah, Hollywood cold Dear dub stand the fuck up.

614
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:33,535
Rym: I Don't know what it is about juggernaut, but I find this hilarious.

615
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:35,140
Scott: Why is this still funny?

616
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,169
Rym: Maybe it's just us.

617
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:42,420
Scott: Maybe we're just stupid Maybe it is just us, but this is still awesome and still funny even though it's been played out.

618
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,251
Scott: But it's like my conscious brain says.

619
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:46,376
Scott: why this?

620
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,320
Scott: why is this funny?

621
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:47,883
Scott: I don't know.

622
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:56,786
Scott: meanwhile, then my gut goes I actually I'll admit.

623
00:39:56,806 --> 00:40:01,880
Rym: I kind of like this song because it's got everything that I like about this hip-hop kind of beat.

624
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,827
Rym: Except it's not about raping my hoes.

625
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:09,820
Rym: It's about being the juggernaut and killing people and the baddest motherfucker on the world.

626
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:15,839
Rym: So Yeah, I don't think any more needs to be said.

627
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:17,945
Scott: Alright, so back in the day.

628
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:19,971
Scott: You know like I'm talking Nasr.

629
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:25,125
Scott: I tell you used to read this Japanese newspaper called The my Nietzsche's in Boone.

630
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:30,727
Scott: right yep, and my Nietzsche is basically a daily Japanese newspaper But you were all.

631
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,040
Scott: for many many years.

632
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:37,055
Scott: You've been able to read it online in English for free which is pretty cool because I could read.

633
00:40:37,075 --> 00:40:42,914
Scott: you know interesting Japanese Newses, and I'd find out about like who is winning the sumo wrestling.

634
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:44,680
Scott: I'd find out about you know.

635
00:40:47,786 --> 00:40:49,120
Rym: So who's winning the sumo wrestling?

636
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:50,799
Rym: But I have entered you at all.

637
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:51,683
Rym: Who did you?

638
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:52,728
Rym: did you look at a picture of the guy?

639
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:55,419
Scott: there's a period of my life for about four months where I?

640
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,904
Scott: Paid attention to it a little bit.

641
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:58,690
Rym: Tanaka lost the championship.

642
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:04,305
Scott: Yeah, I think the guy's name was like Takanohana or something they were.

643
00:41:04,325 --> 00:41:10,130
Scott: yeah, it's all Mongolians these days actually or the sumo masters The Yokozuna is what not any one thing.

644
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:10,995
Rym: I do like sumo.

645
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:19,080
Scott: I like watching sumo Yeah, because I watched it on the plane once I was on a jet-blue flight And it was on ESPN too, and I watched like a whole bunch of sumo action.

646
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:21,280
Scott: So I sort of got into it for a little bit.

647
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,785
Scott: But I was also.

648
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:26,798
Scott: you could find out about like crazy things that happen in Japan.

649
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:42,306
Scott: you know Famous people and occasionally stories about well You know what nerds were doing and the best part about it actually that I liked the most was they'd have like these Photo essays of things that were going on like festivals and stuff, and you know somehow Even you know it's Japan.

650
00:41:42,326 --> 00:41:46,220
Scott: so they would always be like some Gundam or some Godzilla or something in there.

651
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,660
Scott: So I remember this Christmas one.

652
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,700
Scott: It was a Christmas photo essay, and there was a Godzilla made of lights, and I was like ah Japan.

653
00:41:54,905 --> 00:42:29,800
Scott: anyway There was one column on there called a yy Wai wai and the yy column always had weird shit in it like Totally like we're talking scandalous and really sexual kind of Violent weird fucked up charge things you know like so-and-so You know prostitutes and something else crazy or so and so in a porno film and all sorts of really fucked up weird shit and I Accepted it because It's Japan is fucked up shit in Japan.

654
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:33,720
Scott: It makes sense all right, and that was always sort of the fucked up shit column.

655
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:37,260
Scott: And you know my Nietzsche isn't really the New York Times of Japan.

656
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,942
Scott: It's more like.

657
00:42:37,962 --> 00:42:44,100
Scott: it's more like the daily news of Japan, so it's not really you know a highly respectable newspaper.

658
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:50,951
Scott: But anyway my thing of the day if you go to my Nietzsche dot co dot JP I think you might have to go to slash English.

659
00:42:51,011 --> 00:42:51,696
Scott: I'll link you there.

660
00:42:51,716 --> 00:43:00,945
Scott: It doesn't matter They got this big announcement on the front page like we're very sorry our yy column was full of shit And it was terrible journalism.

661
00:43:00,965 --> 00:43:02,913
Scott: It is mostly lies and made-up crap.

662
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:04,580
Scott: We're going straight now.

663
00:43:05,142 --> 00:43:13,355
Scott: We're gonna give you higher quality more respectable news, and I'm like on the one hand That's pretty like you know admirable.

664
00:43:13,475 --> 00:43:15,121
Scott: I guess taking responsibility Etc.

665
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:15,804
Scott: etc.

666
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:19,720
Scott: on the other hand oh, I like that crazy shit, and I want the crazy shit back.

667
00:43:19,961 --> 00:43:21,766
Scott: I don't care if it's lies just say it's lies.

668
00:43:21,806 --> 00:43:26,780
Rym: make that's like reading the National Enquirer or the weekly world news right.

669
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:39,400
Scott: But the thing that makes it better the National Enquirer the weekly world news is this If I look at the National Enquirer weekly world news right there is no doubt in my mind that it's all complete bullshit And it's just not entertaining whatever.

670
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:43,113
Scott: The yy was not that crazy.

671
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:44,478
Scott: It wasn't like bat boy right.

672
00:43:45,001 --> 00:43:57,826
Scott: It was just sort of like you know famous person does something a little crazy or Some person to other you know is involved in some crazy slightly unbelievable scandal, and it's like I Could believe it because it's Japan.

673
00:43:58,389 --> 00:44:09,181
Scott: and it sort of gave me this impression of Japan of yeah It enforced my idea that Japan had this crazy stuff going on And I'm sort of sad to see that that crazy stuff was less than I thought I Lied.

674
00:44:09,222 --> 00:44:11,920
Scott: you know I like thinking of Japan as land of the crazy moon language.

675
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,175
Rym: Such I guess you've grown as a human sad.

676
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:21,180
Rym: learn some things Incredulous.

677
00:44:21,603 --> 00:44:23,840
Scott: I've grown along with the my Nietzsche newspaper.

678
00:44:24,682 --> 00:44:27,290
Scott: Alright, so since we're preparing for conventions.

679
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,834
Scott: We don't have a lot of free time here.

680
00:44:28,855 --> 00:44:30,740
Scott: We're gonna do something kind of short.

681
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,290
Scott: We're just gonna talk about this graphic novel.

682
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:38,888
Scott: the graphic novel is written by Robert Venditti and the art is by.

683
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:40,193
Scott: what does it say Brett?

684
00:44:40,274 --> 00:44:41,820
Scott: well delay well delay?

685
00:44:42,785 --> 00:44:44,720
Scott: Yeah, and it's published by top shelf.

686
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:48,012
Scott: And if you don't know top shelf you don't know comics cuz.

687
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,723
Scott: top shelf prints all Awesomeness.

688
00:44:50,743 --> 00:45:00,419
Scott: they print the alley they print the Essex County They print all the James Robinson stuff like box-office boys and whatnot?

689
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:12,419
Scott: Basically they only print gold and they don't print any poop and one of the gold things that they print is The surrogates which is the comic we're talking about today.

690
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,910
Rym: Yep, now the one thing I want to point out is that the surrogates you buy the trade And it's just one story start to finish it begins it ends.

691
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:20,813
Scott: Yep.

692
00:45:21,495 --> 00:45:22,800
Scott: There's no reason to buy anything else.

693
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,345
Scott: It's one story beginning to end.

694
00:45:24,385 --> 00:45:25,268
Scott: graphic novel.

695
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,071
Scott: you're done right.

696
00:45:26,111 --> 00:45:28,419
Rym: Yeah, there's a sequel coming, but it's not out yet.

697
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,625
Rym: We'll be out for a while.

698
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:32,120
Scott: They're also making a movie based on this comic.

699
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,033
Scott: Supposedly Bruce Willis will be involved and he fits one of the characters.

700
00:45:36,053 --> 00:45:37,840
Scott: so it makes sense Bruce Willis it better be.

701
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:40,272
Scott: Yeah, that totally makes sense for this comic.

702
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:40,794
Scott: if you read it.

703
00:45:40,814 --> 00:45:41,558
Scott: You'll see why.

704
00:45:41,578 --> 00:45:43,796
Scott: yes Bruce Willis is a famous person.

705
00:45:43,856 --> 00:45:46,369
Rym: I know You'll read this.

706
00:45:46,772 --> 00:45:50,855
Rym: and Fifth Element Yes, yes, what else?

707
00:45:50,895 --> 00:45:51,278
Rym: what else?

708
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:53,183
Scott: Armageddon?

709
00:45:53,203 --> 00:45:55,493
Scott: when they're drilling the hole in the rock die hard.

710
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:56,698
Scott: Oh, yeah that one too.

711
00:45:56,779 --> 00:46:11,539
Rym: Yeah Okay, all right, but if you read this It'll read like it was not actually a comic but a vehicle to provide Bruce Willis with another movie to be in.

712
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:19,492
Scott: It does seem like that in many ways, but even though it might seem like that It's still an awesome comic.

713
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:20,639
Scott: So why are you not reading it?

714
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,743
Rym: So the story here?

715
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:26,320
Rym: the deal is that it's the year 2050 something, you know far suit future.

716
00:46:27,507 --> 00:46:29,679
Rym: Actually, it's not that far away and we'll probably alive.

717
00:46:30,261 --> 00:46:33,411
Scott: Probably Scott will probably be a lot more comfortable though.

718
00:46:33,953 --> 00:46:36,240
Scott: I hope so with much better than the iPhone.

719
00:46:38,025 --> 00:46:40,523
Rym: I'm thinking more about having a mansion Impossible.

720
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:42,851
Rym: I yeah that mansion over Newberg's not that expensive.

721
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:45,200
Scott: I think I'm thinking more like private jet private jet.

722
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,869
Rym: We could live on the jet the jets that never lie.

723
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:50,840
Scott: 2050. if I save now I can afford a private jet.

724
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:54,985
Scott: I can fight inflation off Brain in a box.

725
00:46:55,005 --> 00:47:06,320
Rym: But anyway, so Technology's progressed to the point that pretty much everyone in the world at least in the civilized world Uses something called a surrogate to go about their daily life.

726
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,380
Scott: Yeah, anyone who has money if you ever read ghosts in the shell, especially the second one, right?

727
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:36,848
Scott: you'll note that the major uses sort of like these dummy bodies or sort of Decots, you know like remote decoy bodies, basically She goes to bed right and she remotely controls this robot that is in the shape of a human body So that there's a robot going around the world talking to people doing business hanging out making phone calls, whatever and It's not actually a person in the robot.

728
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:47,065
Rym: It's completely empty except for you know mechanical stuff, but at the same time It's a little weird there because her ghost actually, you know But she she's it's a.

729
00:47:47,226 --> 00:47:56,842
Scott: it's like if I went to bed and this robot that looked like me went to work and I was Remotely controlling that robot from my house in bed Sleeping.

730
00:47:56,902 --> 00:48:13,488
Scott: so my biological body doesn't really have to do anything anymore and I can conduct business in the real world with a humanoid Robot that looks exactly like me and can function perhaps even better than I can because if it dies I'm completely safe so I can do dangerous things.

731
00:48:13,528 --> 00:48:16,396
Scott: I can jump high can run fast because I'm a robot.

732
00:48:16,456 --> 00:48:27,307
Rym: now see it's not like Ghost in the shell because the big difference is that this like literally you put a thing over your head and it's like VR use control the thing and feel stuff but You can just knock the thing off your head.

733
00:48:27,347 --> 00:48:30,520
Rym: your you know your ghost or your soul or whatever doesn't travel anywhere.

734
00:48:30,922 --> 00:48:31,988
Rym: There's no like.

735
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,722
Rym: no one's brain or body is Like.

736
00:48:34,742 --> 00:48:37,189
Rym: you're not actually in this thing if it gets blown up.

737
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,653
Rym: You don't get affected at all.

738
00:48:38,714 --> 00:48:38,974
Rym: Yes.

739
00:48:39,115 --> 00:48:40,820
Rym: Oh shit my robot.

740
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:45,238
Scott: Yeah It's no different than if I put a robo sapien on the floor and can do the remote control.

741
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:48,160
Scott: only It's a much more advanced than a robo sapien.

742
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,907
Scott: It can do everything that you can do.

743
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:52,758
Scott: only it's you know, you have just not holding our mode control in your hands.

744
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,517
Rym: So nominally the story is I don't I mean, I don't want to talk too much.

745
00:48:58,537 --> 00:48:59,420
Scott: I can't spoil it.

746
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,306
Scott: It's just one book.

747
00:49:00,507 --> 00:49:11,925
Rym: Yes, and I really don't want to spoil where it goes but the beginning of the plot is that basically two people who are obviously both in surrogate bodies are Getting it on in an alley.

748
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:14,211
Scott: Oh man getting it on with the robots.

749
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:21,872
Rym: Yeah, so someone comes and kills them both Obviously someone who is anti surrogate body or just crazy.

750
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:22,794
Rym: You don't really know.

751
00:49:22,815 --> 00:49:30,059
Rym: Yeah, but basically and From there this comic follows the story of the police investigating this crime.

752
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:38,220
Rym: but it also if what it does more so is it kind of explores the world and the ramifications of if this sort of technology were possible.

753
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:51,737
Rym: I mean and it and you read this and it's one of those instances where The person who the people who put this comic together the person who wrote it obviously Took a page from every comic it ever read.

754
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:52,580
Rym: that was good.

755
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:55,670
Rym: It draws heavily from the techniques used in Watchmen.

756
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:58,620
Rym: it draws heavily from things like Dark Knight Returns.

757
00:49:59,122 --> 00:49:59,907
Scott: Yeah, yep.

758
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:02,080
Scott: Yep, you can just you read this and you go, huh?

759
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:07,520
Scott: I see a little sign of everything that is good about comics and it's all sort of comes together right here.

760
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:18,060
Rym: I mean it even does the thing where like you read and read and read and then like it stops and Then there's a few pages of an article from a newspaper from within the world and it's just a whole article.

761
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,824
Rym: You can just read it.

762
00:50:19,165 --> 00:50:23,562
Rym: Yeah, and the advertisements in the comic are advertisements From the world.

763
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:29,559
Rym: Yep, and I actually really like those advertisements because I remember thinking oh, yeah, I could use one of these.

764
00:50:29,799 --> 00:50:33,008
Scott: Yeah Wait, that's not a real ad shit.

765
00:50:33,048 --> 00:50:33,409
Scott: Damn it.

766
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:33,952
Scott: Damn it.

767
00:50:35,036 --> 00:50:35,960
Scott: I want a robot body.

768
00:50:36,281 --> 00:50:45,120
Rym: Oh, I don't really want to get into the plot beyond that but in terms of the world I mean that this is actually well thought out in terms of how it considers these issues.

769
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:45,835
Rym: You think about it?

770
00:50:46,621 --> 00:50:57,800
Rym: If all the wealthy people and even the middle-class people in the world, even some of the poorer people are using robot bodies Gender and race suddenly don't mean anything anymore.

771
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:58,864
Scott: Yeah, black man.

772
00:50:58,924 --> 00:51:00,530
Scott: He is a white body white guy.

773
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:03,360
Scott: He's a black body guy could use a girl body.

774
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:11,659
Rym: I think they even talked about a political campaign where a person who was running for office who happened to be white Used a black surrogate to run.

775
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:18,502
Rym: now This wasn't like he like hid and like no one knew that it was actually a white man like The.

776
00:51:18,562 --> 00:51:33,261
Scott: deep down they all wants to be what right anyway Ever.

777
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:37,818
Scott: I only seen it once and I was on a bus bus watching on the coach bus TV.

778
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:42,555
Rym: The last movie I watched on a coach bus was that was the last movie.

779
00:51:42,575 --> 00:51:43,540
Scott: I watched in the coach bus.

780
00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:58,611
Rym: I had some sports movie anyway, so and it talks about the political ramifications that he did it openly because his idea was if I'm going to be representing this poor urban Area and this poor urban area happens to be filled largely with minorities.

781
00:51:59,353 --> 00:52:04,704
Rym: I should represent them both physically and electorally Mm-hmm, and there's.

782
00:52:04,804 --> 00:52:15,489
Rym: it goes into all these interesting things about how like CEOs tend to be male Even though actually a lot of CEOs are female But they use male bodies because of like the social mores.

783
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:30,140
Rym: and it talks about how some stereotypes become more enhanced partly because of the fact that they're now completely irrelevant and arbitrary and I Think it does a really good job of addressing the kind of realistic expectations and ramifications of this technology.

784
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:38,792
Scott: Yeah, and also, you know, it does the thing that every good book and and you know story does is, you know By showing you a world that is not your own.

785
00:52:38,853 --> 00:52:40,924
Scott: They hold up a mirror to the world that is your own.

786
00:52:40,984 --> 00:52:47,429
Scott: like the part that always gets me is the Cop's wife who won't cut you won't.

787
00:52:47,529 --> 00:52:49,777
Scott: his guy is married to this woman.

788
00:52:49,897 --> 00:52:50,600
Scott: They're married.

789
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:51,766
Rym: yes, you see the cop now.

790
00:52:51,786 --> 00:52:57,828
Rym: the cop is good-looking and young and awesome and His wife is a sex Baba.

791
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:00,376
Rym: Yep, but they're just surrogate bodies.

792
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,480
Scott: They share a house.

793
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:03,080
Scott: Yeah, it's like they share a house.

794
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:09,776
Scott: They live in the same house But the wife has locked her biological body in her room and won't come out.

795
00:53:10,137 --> 00:53:12,628
Scott: because you know I guess I don't know.

796
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,640
Scott: It's hard to tell if she's actually ugly.

797
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:19,140
Scott: She's probably alright looking in there, but she doesn't look as good as the robot body.

798
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,435
Rym: She doesn't always perfect look as good as she did when she was young.

799
00:53:23,516 --> 00:53:32,880
Scott: now she's middle-aged So she doesn't want anyone to see her not even her own husband Because she only wants you to see the robot body which is perfect in all ways.

800
00:53:33,582 --> 00:53:38,479
Rym: It's just serious image problems, but it's the same that I mean reading this and there's action scenes.

801
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:41,828
Rym: and How can murders happen if there's no people?

802
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:49,991
Rym: murders become property crime crimes and as a result people stop murdering anymore Police officers because you can use a surrogate body.

803
00:53:50,473 --> 00:53:51,416
Rym: anyone can be a cop.

804
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:54,106
Rym: There's no physical requirement So there's only mental requirements.

805
00:53:54,527 --> 00:54:06,183
Rym: crime pretty much disappears because you can just use Effectively deadly force against criminals and even if you do it's the same as stopping someone's car by disabling the engine It.

806
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:11,420
Rym: it paints a really interesting picture of a future that is not that far out of the realm.

807
00:54:12,343 --> 00:54:16,420
Scott: No, I mean, you know ghost in the shell types technology is a little bit crazy.

808
00:54:16,942 --> 00:54:23,550
Scott: Remote control robots with an advanced user interface Wirelessly is not that crazy.

809
00:54:23,751 --> 00:54:24,816
Scott: That's something that could vary.

810
00:54:24,836 --> 00:54:25,760
Scott: we could do that right now.

811
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,887
Scott: It wouldn't be that good, but we could get.

812
00:54:27,927 --> 00:54:28,649
Scott: we could get that.

813
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:29,973
Scott: That's definitely reasonable.

814
00:54:29,993 --> 00:54:37,526
Scott: I Don't know if we could get it to the point where everyone could afford it and you'd have enough energy to power all those guys Walking around instead of people.

815
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:39,475
Rym: but I mean eventually that happens.

816
00:54:39,515 --> 00:54:39,796
Rym: Yeah.

817
00:54:39,897 --> 00:54:52,497
Rym: Yeah eventually But you know at the same time there's large crazy religious movements of people who think these things are Abominations and they shoot technology and they try to live a primitive life and all the ramifications of that.

818
00:54:52,517 --> 00:54:54,666
Scott: Mm-hmm Now the art in this book.

819
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,379
Scott: I like it actually quite a bit.

820
00:54:57,399 --> 00:55:00,054
Scott: It's mean It's not like the greatest art in the universe, but it's like it's.

821
00:55:00,235 --> 00:55:03,906
Scott: it's sort of like this Swirly painted kind of look.

822
00:55:03,946 --> 00:55:07,820
Scott: it's not you know, things aren't like super clear, but it's done.

823
00:55:08,082 --> 00:55:08,384
Scott: It's not.

824
00:55:08,424 --> 00:55:10,479
Scott: like a lot of times when people do that kind of work.

825
00:55:10,842 --> 00:55:15,243
Scott: You can't really you know, tell one thing apart from the other, you know It's our time to tell.

826
00:55:15,283 --> 00:55:16,588
Scott: you know as the character that character.

827
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:20,520
Scott: but in this you can tell perfectly who's who and what's what at?

828
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:21,202
Scott: Times.

829
00:55:21,544 --> 00:55:29,415
Scott: you can even tell like, you know, the someone's robot body, you know Even if they made a robot body that's matches their biological body.

830
00:55:29,436 --> 00:55:30,460
Scott: You can tell them apart.

831
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:35,800
Scott: So that's you know, it's really cool how it's not like this crystal clear.

832
00:55:36,141 --> 00:55:40,420
Scott: Crystal clear sharply drawn, you know art that everything is perfect.

833
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:43,120
Scott: But you can still tell what everything is awesomely.

834
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:57,478
Scott: But at the same time everything is really dark and you get this really sort of heavy Atmosphere that goes with the sort of the painted look Gives you that same level of kind of oppression and claustrophobia that I don't know Blade Runner did.

835
00:55:57,518 --> 00:56:10,060
Rym: really well Yeah, it definitely feels like Closing in and everything's real and gritty and and it and I. the other thing I really like is that you know The main character the protagonist the cop detective who you kind of follow through this whole thing.

836
00:56:10,361 --> 00:56:13,636
Scott: He's like the guy who's outside the the building in Die Hard.

837
00:56:13,757 --> 00:56:17,280
Scott: Yeah The guy from you know, the dad from Merkel.

838
00:56:17,602 --> 00:56:23,220
Rym: But when you see him out of his surrogate body What you do you see a lot of people out of their surrogate bodies because you know the real world.

839
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:30,800
Rym: Hey, I love the fact that he's paunchy and out of shape and kind of schlubby, but he's still in there.

840
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:31,930
Rym: It's still him.

841
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:32,899
Scott: It's still him.

842
00:56:33,362 --> 00:56:34,226
Scott: He's alright cuz.

843
00:56:34,246 --> 00:56:38,245
Scott: he went and got a surrogate that looked kind of like him only, you know Stronger-looking.

844
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:44,132
Rym: it probably looked the way he did 20 years previous probably But he's a good guy.

845
00:56:44,394 --> 00:56:45,019
Scott: he's a good guy.

846
00:56:45,226 --> 00:56:52,200
Rym: Yeah Honestly, I'd really want to avoid saying more because anything I say beyond this point could possibly ruin this book.

847
00:56:52,461 --> 00:56:58,297
Scott: Yeah, and it's primarily a cop story but also sci-fi but also social commentary.

848
00:56:58,397 --> 00:56:59,480
Rym: It's super well done.

849
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:01,046
Rym: I highly recommend it.

850
00:57:01,428 --> 00:57:04,400
Scott: Yeah, I mean, well, you should buy everything that says top shelf on it.

851
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,464
Scott: Yeah, you have to choose.

852
00:57:05,484 --> 00:57:09,480
Scott: you should probably choose Essex County and then if you've already read that you should choose the surrogates.

853
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:15,138
Rym: Yes, however, if you're looking for something quicker like a single quick read cuz it's a quick read.

854
00:57:15,218 --> 00:57:23,106
Scott: It's short I mean what it was five mini issues and it's probably going to be an awesome movie someday I think maybe.

855
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:26,240
Scott: so if you read it now think about how cool you'll be when it is.

856
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:29,152
Scott: Actually when all your friends find out about it, you can be like.

857
00:57:29,474 --> 00:57:30,137
Scott: I know what that is.

858
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:30,539
Scott: I read it.

859
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:35,936
Scott: You could be cool not like the people who are you know only reading Watchmen.

860
00:57:35,976 --> 00:57:37,060
Scott: now that there's a trailer.

861
00:57:37,363 --> 00:57:39,300
Scott: You could be cool like the people who knew about it before.

862
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:46,825
Rym: All right, and on that note because you're obviously cooler if you know about something before someone else exactly I think we're done.

863
00:57:46,845 --> 00:57:47,748
Scott: We are done.

864
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:50,720
Rym: Well, we'll see you hopefully at Connecticut.

865
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:53,113
Scott: See you next year in a few days.

866
00:57:53,133 --> 00:57:54,500
Rym: Don't look for us until Saturday.

867
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:59,300
Rym: We're gonna be there Friday, but we'll be keeping a low profile going out for drinks that sort of thing.

868
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,394
Rym: Don't don't don't try to find us if you see us just kind of stay away Saturday.

869
00:58:03,695 --> 00:58:08,182
Rym: Come and say hi Saturday We're gonna be all around doing stuff Friday.

870
00:58:08,424 --> 00:58:08,947
