1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,809
Rym: It's Thursday, March 13th.

2
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:12,733
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:16,532
Rym: I don't know what rims gonna call this episode And I didn't know what I was gonna tell the episode.

4
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:17,960
Rym: and then I said tall instead of calm.

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:36,820
Rym: Let's do this Instead of what I usually do which is slip out of work and buy a beard papa to eat on the train.

6
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:41,471
Rym: I actually went and bought a holla instead And I was actually thinking of buying a bread.

7
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:46,440
Scott: when I walked by the bread stand, you know I took the late train home, but I didn't buy a bread and you know what?

8
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:53,360
Rym: I'm glad I didn't because when I got home there was a bread sitting there, you know We'd better call Randy because there must have been some sort of psychic synchronicity.

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,660
Scott: Yeah, that bread stand I walk by every day and think about brying a bread every day.

10
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:03,017
Rym: Yeah, what a coincidence that how much money can the bakeries in Grand Central make?

11
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:03,859
Rym: I mean think about this.

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,299
Scott: Well, the bakery itself is somewhere else and they just they have like locations around the city and they just bring it.

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,219
Scott: They just you know, drive bread around to the different locations.

14
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:18,700
Rym: Well, yeah central big bakery places that sell bread and they do bake some of the smaller things directly.

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,567
Rym: They're partly because it generate that.

16
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:23,076
Scott: well, you know, they heat up some frozen things things like that.

17
00:01:23,157 --> 00:01:23,940
Rym: No, they also bake.

18
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:24,903
Scott: What do they bake?

19
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:27,913
Rym: I've seen them bringing in the dough in the remember.

20
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:30,464
Rym: I get there in the morning when the deliveries are still Coming in.

21
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:32,479
Rym: Yeah, they bake.

22
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:36,260
Rym: Anyway, whatever you say how much money do they have to make?

23
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,180
Rym: I mean think about two hundred something thousand people walk past that bread stand twice a day.

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,640
Scott: Well, it looks like they have there right about every day.

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,511
Scott: How many bagels would you think are stacked up there early in the morning?

26
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:48,719
Scott: a lot five hundred to a thousand bagels?

27
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:51,049
Rym: Well, I think there's a simpler way to look at this.

28
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,879
Rym: two hundred thousand people walk past that every day.

29
00:01:53,726 --> 00:02:00,760
Rym: They walk past the first time When it's morning and they probably didn't eat breakfast because you know a lot of people who take the train don't eat breakfast.

30
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:06,999
Rym: So hey, I could get a bagel and cream cheese for like a dollar right there and it's on my way to work.

31
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:09,199
Rym: It won't inconvenience me at all.

32
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:12,660
Scott: That's already like a thousand dollars in the morning at least, you know.

33
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:21,876
Scott: then you add in the coffees add in the two dollar fifty cent orange juice add in all the paint like the Danishes and muffins and rolls and then the sans.

34
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:22,358
Rym: I've known.

35
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:28,647
Rym: it's weird But like when I worked at IBM, even when I worked at well I guess the house now cuz the cross one I think a long commute is.

36
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:40,900
Rym: what does it because I worked at IBM be like, all right I'm going home and I'd leave at some point between three and six just depending on what I felt like and I Would just drive home and then I'd get home and I'd do stuff and I would like for summer.

37
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:42,380
Rym: I would just wait and then I eat dinner later.

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:57,080
Rym: But then when I had a long commute when I drive home from the hospital or from anywhere in the Bronx I would almost invariably stop at a Starbucks and get like a cookie and a coffee Or I'd stop it like a gas station get a Red Bull and like a snacky cake.

39
00:02:57,582 --> 00:02:59,067
Rym: I just I'd get something to eat.

40
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:11,523
Rym: and now every day while I don't do it every day My brain always says hey Rym You better buy some sort of melon pot or something to eat on that train because five minutes after it starts rolling You're gonna wish you had it.

41
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:14,735
Scott: Yeah, pretty much every day if I don't buy something.

42
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:19,500
Rym: I'm on the train like damn it I would pay like 10 bucks if someone would give me some food, right?

43
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,930
Scott: That's why as soon as I get home, I just died like eat like three snacks and drink some juice every day.

44
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:29,829
Scott: So Ram what are we doing the show on today?

45
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:32,522
Rym: Oh, well, I think we'll get to that in the minute We don't?

46
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:33,368
Rym: we got nothing.

00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:34,174

00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:47,620
Scott: not always sometimes we do that We're gonna we're gonna get at we're gonna do the news and then we're gonna sit around thinking of what the main bits gonna be.

51
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,600
Rym: Yeah, you're gonna you're you know, it's a bit like talking.

52
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,799
Rym: They don't hear that thing that a music come in then it stops.

53
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:54,778
Rym: We're basically gonna pause and one that thing of the day.

54
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,946
Rym: music So you all know is not live.

55
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:01,260
Rym: that's added in after the fact by a script that figures out when we stop talking.

Rym: Well,

76
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:59,430

77
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,239
Rym: ah The wonder of committing something that is not actually a crime, but yet you can still be punished for.

78
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:07,804
Rym: However, it's cool.

79
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:08,708

80
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:11,439

Scott: Anyway, because this real power the student government at a middle school.

88

00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,944
Scott: Whatever that contraband is is the story.

91
00:05:51,964 --> 00:05:53,807

00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:56,130
Rym: we have this obesity epidemic, right?

93
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,999
Scott: It was soda or candy or something?

94
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:06,200
Rym: Well, this obesity epidemic is brought on entirely by people's own goddamn faults if they just eat less food, but I digress.

95
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,739
Rym: Yep, also corn subsidies are not helping.

96
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:11,438
Scott: Not helping too much not helping at all.

97
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,245
Rym: Man any day.

98
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,750
Rym: now my Dublin.

99
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:15,031
Rym: Dr.

100
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:15,934
Rym: Pepper is gonna be here.

101
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:20,066
Rym: I ordered two cases of Cane sugar original recipe.

102
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:20,386
Rym: Dr.

103
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:20,788
Rym: Pepper.

104
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:22,493
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

105
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:24,840
Rym: I ordered it at no small expense, too.

106
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,249
Rym: So you visit goths who are coming.

107
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:27,256
Rym: you're not drinking it.

108
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:30,129
Rym: if it comes tomorrow I'm gonna.

109
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,054
Scott: I'm gonna hide this crap.

110
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:31,899
Scott: You're gonna have to.

111
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,840
Scott: well I think you should do is I think you should just give them all one bottle one bottle for all of them.

112
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:44,456
Scott: So that way it's even more cruel because they all know what they're missing But they can't get any and they get like such a small portion of one serving.

113
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:49,180
Scott: That's so mean I know of course, I mean they could always get but you you deserve to do that.

114
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:50,644
Rym: Well, yeah, I guess I do.

115
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:51,929
Rym: actually it wasn't that expensive.

116
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,256
Rym: The thing is it was like, oh man, it's only $10 a case.

117
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,125
Rym: I'm gonna order like 10 cases.

118
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:58,489
Scott: shipping is like 20 bucks.

119
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:02,000
Rym: Yeah, then I realized wait a minute freight shipping cases.

120
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,471
Scott: Are they glass bottles or cans or what?

121
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:06,640
Rym: Actually, I could have gotten glass bottles or cans.

122
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:13,311
Rym: I chose cans because the cost per ounce including the glass Not worth it.

123
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:17,916
Scott: No I would have gotten one case of glass bottles and the rest cans.

124
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:24,500
Scott: and that way you you know You have the glass bottles for those special times, but then you know, you have the cans for practicality.

125
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,436
Rym: You know, I actually what I'm thinking of doing is I'm gonna I gotta make sure cuz I'm.

126
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:29,742
Rym: I had real You know what?

127
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,227
Scott: What if you get it and it tastes like shit?

128
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:32,592
Rym: Well, I had real dr.

129
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:34,902
Rym: Pepper when I was a kid like real Dr.

130
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:35,244
Rym: Pepper.

131
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:35,808
Rym: cuz dr.

132
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:42,375
Rym: Pepper was hard to get up in Michigan and Relatives would bring it from down south because my mom was addicted to it and at a young age.

133
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:44,762
Rym: So was I. but Dr.

134
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:47,796
Rym: Pepper changed and now it's a different recipe uses corn syrup and all that.

135
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:48,640
Rym: but this is the real deal.

136
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:53,744
Rym: so I got to make sure that it tastes as good as I remember and Experience thing.

137
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:56,240
Rym: I think it will be because I love Mexican soda.

138
00:07:56,521 --> 00:08:04,796
Rym: Mexican soda is thousand times better than anything you get in the US other than maybe the Passover coke Mmm, so, uh, I ordered the canes to make sure it's good.

139
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:08,716
Rym: if it's good I'm gonna order some of the glass and I think I'm gonna put it in the wine cabinet.

140
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:09,439
Rym: next all the wine.

141
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,225
Scott: Go go you.

142
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:12,411
Rym: it costs about the same.

143
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,300
Scott: Are you gonna mix it with the Vodak?

144
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,750
Rym: No, all right, dr.

145
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,120
Rym: Pepper and vodka would taste.

146
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:19,903
Scott: What do I know?

147
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:20,586
Scott: I don't like either.

148
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:24,783
Scott: one of those beverages that I know that people mix the alcohols and the sodas That's what I know.

149
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:29,482
Rym: You just said to me is like hey, what if you take your orange juice you mix it with pay What?

150
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:32,657
Scott: oh hey, that's doo-doo thing is to me the book.

153
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:36,549
Scott: all soda and all alcohol tastes like pee.

154
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:43,772
Rym: So it's like, you know know what you mix with dr Pepper dear Scott is rum particularly spiced rum.

155
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:45,176
Scott: Okay, cuz cuz I know.

156
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:46,299
Rym: well, you should know.

157
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,273
Scott: no I shouldn't cuz I don't drink rum and I don't drink dr.

158
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:49,574
Scott: Pepper.

159
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:50,700
Rym: I'm gonna give you a little hint.

160
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,227
Rym: Here's an easy way to tell this doesn't work for everything.

161
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:59,945
Rym: if it's a brown drink put a brown liquor in it It's not a brown drink.

162
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:02,334
Rym: You shouldn't be putting a brown liquor in it.

163
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:03,940
Rym: There are some exceptions.

164
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,695
Rym: There's a lot of exceptions, but that's a good rule to go by.

165
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:12,997
Scott: Uh-huh So it could we make up some sort of rhyme to go with that like if it's brown flush it down.

166
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:14,425
Rym: if it's brown Chuck it down.

167
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:15,029
Scott: It's yellow.

168
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,499
Rym: Let him read go to bed.

169
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,050
Rym: That's terrible, I don't know.

170
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:23,094
Rym: red bullets dr.

171
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:23,516
Rym: Pepper's.

172
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,780
Rym: Yeah, it's kind of urine colored.

173
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:31,170
Rym: Well, we don't have a main bit we digress.

174
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:32,595
Scott: can I do my news?

175
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:33,719
Rym: I didn't even get to mine.

176
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,826
Scott: oh So, uh, that's right the kid.

177
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:40,820
Rym: So here's the quote from the superintendent super Nintendo Reginald Mayo.

178
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,351
Scott: Well, what is the was the contraband?

179
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:44,416
Rym: I'm getting to that.

180
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,286
Rym: All right, the principal He said quote.

181
00:09:46,326 --> 00:09:52,390
Rym: the principal was just trying to keep students safe Okay safe from this contraband now.

182
00:09:52,631 --> 00:10:01,740
Rym: he was originally suspended this kid for three days But they brought it down to one day in Light of his honor record and the fact that he was the vice president of the Student Council.

183
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,412
Rym: However, they did as I said impeach him and strip him of his title.

184
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:06,716
Rym: He will not be reinstated.

185
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:22,014
Rym: Uh-huh Michael said that he did not realize the item purchase was against the rules But he admitted later that he did notice that the students selling the item on February 26 Might have been acting somewhat secretive.

186
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:27,154
Rym: Mm-hmm The banned item was a bag of skittles.

187
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,759
Scott: Oh Man, now one got to sue the school over that one.

188
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,587
Rym: Yeah This this bothers me a little bit.

189
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:36,995
Scott: that courses middle school doesn't matter that much.

190
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:46,194
Rym: this New Haven School system the entire system banned candy sales in 2003 as part of a district ride wide school wellness policy.

191
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:47,940
Rym: now, I remember my high school.

192
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:58,800
Rym: Right, my high school was worried not so much about obesity, but more about just a kid's got to be healthy Whatever which I think was absolutely not true because the stuff they sold for lunches in that high school.

193
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,685
Rym: I don't we want to get into that.

194
00:10:59,705 --> 00:11:02,180
Rym: Mm-hmm, but there was one pop machine.

195
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:06,860
Rym: I can say pop because it's referring to the past much like how we had a friend.

196
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:13,512
Rym: We'll have a friend who got a sex change and changed the name as a result And then we had a serious debate as to whether or not.

197
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:28,720
Rym: if referring to the person now we use the new name obviously, but what if we're referring to a story that happened in the past when the name and gender were different and The answer from the person in question was well if I was a dude back then then use my dude name.

198
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:33,780
Rym: And because I was a dude then if I'm not a dude in the story then use my non dude name.

199
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,040
Scott: It's as if someone died and was reborn and it's two different people.

200
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,350
Rym: Yeah, so if you ever have a sex change in friend, that's the answer.

201
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:43,600
Scott: All right, but anyway great advice from Rym.

202
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:47,372
Rym: So I can say pop because I lived in Michigan.

203
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:48,214
Rym: It was pop.

204
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:49,739
Rym: It was the pot machine in other words you.

205
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,966
Scott: so You agree that it's soda now.

206
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:53,653
Rym: No, it's pop.

207
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:54,154
Rym: I'm just so.

208
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:55,580
Scott: why do you have to make a disclaimer?

209
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,242
Scott: You know what?

210
00:11:56,262 --> 00:12:02,040
Scott: I have to make a disclaimer if the default was not soda The only reason the fault was the only reason you would only have to disclaim soda.

211
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,568
Scott: I think you basically just done yourself.

212
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:04,829
Scott: in

213
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:17,295
Rym: the only reason I have to make a disclaimer because I point out that According to that survey at the last time I looked at it, which was a couple of years ago So it might have changed but soda and pop were pretty much neck and neck and

214
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,920
Scott: I think your trust that survey.

215
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,780
Rym: Yes as a valid scientific It's been widely cited, but I think we can all agree on one thing.

216
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,091
Scott: Yeah, a lot of things are widely cited.

217
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:27,935
Scott: that doesn't mean anything.

218
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:28,197
Scott: I could.

219
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:32,112
Scott: I could write You know rims-a-douche and then cite it a hundred times.

220
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:34,442
Scott: it doesn't make it any less false I think.

221
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:37,056
Rym: I think you've discovered the secret to editing Wikipedia.

222
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:49,799
Rym: Yeah Alright, but I think that us pop believers and you soda heathens can agree on one thing much Like how Muslims and Christians agree on one thing they agree that atheists suck and generally don't like them.

223
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:56,743
Rym: I think we can agree that if you say coke and you're not referring to coca-cola or at least a cola beverage you're wrong Alright.

224
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:58,913
Scott: so continue with the with the news here about the skittles.

225
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:03,060
Rym: Alright, so in my old high school The pop machine, right?

226
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,500
Rym: Yeah They would turn it off during school hours because there was some sort of mandate where they didn't want kids buying unhealthy things.

227
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:16,269
Rym: You couldn't buy pop during school Mmm, and all but the real reason.

228
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:21,730
Rym: and I got this straight from the vice principal's mouth And it was verified by a bunch of other people.

229
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:28,740
Rym: The real reason was the pop machine Would be used to the exclusion of all the juice machines and the school was losing revenue.

230
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:35,080
Rym: The pop machine was owned by some outside company and there were these juice machines that the school owned.

231
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:37,470
Rym: No one wanted juice from the juice machine.

232
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:38,996
Rym: wasn't even real juice.

233
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:44,120
Scott: Wow See when I was in middle school, there was just a juice machine, right?

234
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,900
Scott: But when I was in high school, there was a candy store.

235
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:50,599
Scott: They would sell candy in the school every day.

236
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:52,593
Scott: There was actually see.

237
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:53,600
Rym: my high school had that too.

238
00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:03,819
Scott: So I don't get it for until my senior year because basically what they did is when I was a freshman We were the first class of freshmen in high school who weren't allowed to smoke.

239
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:15,460
Scott: All the people older than us could smoke on the smoking dock And when we were seniors the smoking dock was finally just an area you could go, you know It wasn't the smoking area because that now there was no smoking.

240
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:25,318
Scott: But when I was a junior the people who were sophomores when I was a freshman they were the current seniors and they they were the only ones who can go outside and smoke on the smoking dock.

241
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,647
Scott: and There was smoking in high school.

242
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:30,659
Scott: and now now you can't even get skittles.

243
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,875
Rym: God Also, we should do this show about what high school was like when we were in high school.

244
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:39,509
Rym: because think about this We got a lot of listeners.

245
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:42,186
Scott: I think we just did the whole show though I got a lot more to say.

246
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:44,640
Rym: my I used to go to the mall over lunch.

247
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:49,029
Scott: I used to just leave I think for the news that you just did.

248
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:53,020
Scott: I think the general problem there is, you know, no candy in school.

249
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,759
Scott: I mean when I was in middle school, you know candy sales in school.

250
00:14:57,281 --> 00:15:00,913
Rym: Oh because he bought the skittles from a contraband dealer.

251
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,370
Scott: Okay, but basically Here's the moral.

252
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:06,631
Rym: before you get into your thing There's so we could do.

253
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:07,760
Rym: you don't have to go back to this story?

254
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:15,060
Rym: The moral is the kid who's not named who is selling the contraband Gets mad props for being awesome.

255
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:21,920
Rym: And if my school had banned the sale of pop or something you can bet your ass I would had an illegal pop dispenser in my locker.

256
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:33,699
Scott: You know back in the way back in the day when Mortal Kombat was a new game a friend of mine wrote a strategy guide for it and Sold it the copies and sold it to kids in school and got in trouble for it.

257
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,994
Scott: He got mad moneys that he needed for something.

258
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:38,440
Scott: I think he bought a Super Nintendo or something.

259
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,546
Rym: Man the school shouldn't punish that.

260
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,732
Rym: the school should reward him for being entrepreneur.

261
00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:51,060
Scott: I know right, but yeah, basically I think the only problem with the story that you just read there was that the punishment was way too harsh.

262
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,980
Scott: I mean suspended and stripped of student of vice president because you bought skittles.

263
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,938
Scott: I mean I could understand that for say maybe like, you know cheated, you know on like a final.

264
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:08,240
Scott: or You know is giving out answer books or stole something from somebody, you know something somewhat serious.

265
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:11,578
Rym: I'm glad you said final though because I'm cheating on homework.

266
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:19,988
Rym: I Whenever I couldn't get around but buying skittles, that's one detention at most, you know You know what that.

267
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,584
Rym: all that should be is one Punish the seller.

268
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,054
Rym: that do course that I'm sure the seller got punished a lot more and I'm sure.

269
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:28,340
Rym: but that seller mad props.

270
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,417
Scott: The seller was probably not a high-class, you know student vice president.

271
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:33,160
Scott: He doesn't get in the news.

272
00:16:33,482 --> 00:16:35,360
Rym: Yeah, it's always the sad thing in high school.

273
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,409
Rym: All you kids in high school remember and remember well.

274
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:47,340
Rym: as long as these teachers and administrators Believe that you are a nice kid You will get away with anything you want to get away with.

275
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:51,340
Rym: However, if they think you're a troublemaker you'll get in trouble if you didn't do anything.

276
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:53,547
Rym: That's kind of the world works.

277
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:55,516
Rym: So learn it in high school and take advantage of it.

278
00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:56,300
Scott: crying wolf.

279
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,299
Rym: There's a reason the honors kids skip class a hell of a lot more than I don't want to say you because a lot of You are honors kids.

280
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,175
Rym: But there's a reason those kids skip a lot more and get away with a lot more.

281
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:06,385
Scott: if you're an honors kid You're not skipping.

282
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:07,010
Scott: What's wrong with you?

283
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:08,280
Rym: Yeah, seriously, you're obvious.

284
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,432
Scott: You're the nerdy type who needs to learn to cut loose.

285
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:20,105
Rym: if you're a junior in high school And you've had perfect attendance for two years you had straight A's and you've never really been in trouble and you think you're not geek That's definitely nerd territory.

286
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,454
Rym: No, cuz I was like that except for the perfect attendance.

287
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:27,934
Rym: I Didn't skip though until my sophomore year of high school and I said wait a minute.

288
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:29,540
Rym: I don't have to go to class.

289
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:30,708
Rym: What are they gonna do?

290
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:31,958
Rym: they're not gonna expel me.

291
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:41,199
Scott: No, all right, so you're a fan of the sub vocalization, are you not?

292
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:42,641
Scott: I Am.

293
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,247
Rym: oh, I know I know what your news is.

294
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:44,648
Rym: Yeah.

295
00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:45,972
Scott: Yeah for those.

296
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:58,356
Scott: You don't know sub vocalization is basically I mean, it's really it's sort of hard to come with an exact definition, but basically No That's a Wikipedia is sort of sort of unsure about how much I can trust Wikipedia.

297
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:02,155
Rym: Don't go by Wikipedia Talk, I'll look at the Wikipedia.

298
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:03,000
Rym: Let's see if it's accurate.

299
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,291
Scott: Basically, it's somewhere but you're basically talking but you're not talking.

300
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:15,475
Scott: like imagine if you talked and you went through all the motions of talking But you removed the lips tongue and mouth part and you just use the throat part.

301
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:18,540
Scott: now some people even say Oh, you don't even use the throat part.

302
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:30,080
Scott: You just sort of you know Think about some words and your body's your the nerves in your body and your throat sort of do Thing but they don't actually make any noise and that is largely true.

303
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:40,520
Rym: I mean theoretically you could make a device that would read like I Don't know nerve impulses in your neck and throat and figure out what words you were thinking about with the gym.

304
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:41,607
Scott: Did you just read my news?

305
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,680
Rym: Actually, I didn't read it, but I saw the headline.

306
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,463
Scott: yeah, basically someone's made a device that basically reads the nerves in your neck and There's a picture.

307
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:51,309
Scott: they figure out what were is a video.

308
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,507
Scott: they figure out what words you're sub vocalizing And then it sort of says them out loud.

309
00:18:56,788 --> 00:19:00,920
Scott: so you can talk without talking so like, you know what this does.

310
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,067
Scott: You're like tongue gets cut out.

311
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:04,432
Scott: suddenly you can talk.

312
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:05,836
Rym: There's more to it than that.

313
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:13,915
Rym: I mean think about this Theoretically that for certain kinds of paralysis, too Yeah, you could talk again, but also beyond

314
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:14,578
Scott: thinking the

315
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:24,496
Rym: words This is also very because devices like this that don't measure the nerve impulses But you can talk very low like so low that no one could possibly hear you in your throat.

316
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:37,756
Rym: and a lot of Special forces people use these things and police forces use these things to communicate in say hostile environment Where you don't to be like counter-strike where I'm sitting there around the corner and I'm waiting for

317
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:42,410
Scott: and you gotta say you gotta tell Someone to circle around back, but if you go hey Rym circle

318
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,871
Rym: around

319
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,776
Scott: back suddenly all the terrorists go.

320
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:46,220
Rym: I heard Scott.

321
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:47,559
Scott: Let's go shoot him.

322
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:56,580
Scott: They're coming from behind they're coming from behind they're circling around back Of course, I don't say that and then circle around front and then shoot him in the back.

323
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,629
Rym: But then all your teammates circle around back.

324
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,333
Scott: I know man.

325
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:04,492
Rym: I Don't know anyone realizes the joke with a full joke of circle around back.

326
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,077
Scott: Well, tell it another time.

327
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:06,980
Scott: Should we let's save it?

328
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,724
Scott: It's a good joke.

329
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:10,497
Rym: I could you know, we'll wait until I find audio of that.

330
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:13,733
Rym: good Go that is that is I don't think anything needs to be said.

331
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:14,074
Scott: Nope.

332
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:14,999
Rym: All right.

333
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:16,806
Scott: So, yeah, go go go.

334
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:20,660
Scott: so they made this device and you know, it's gonna be pretty awesome.

335
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,076
Scott: but the thing is right now it can only recognize about a hundred and fifty words and phrases.

336
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:37,099
Scott: and because it has to do so Much processing even with the fast processor in there This is a delay between the time you sub vocalize and the time that it says the words out loud for you.

337
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:37,918
Rym: But you know what?

338
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,880
Rym: That doesn't matter at all because all what this is if nothing else is a proof of concept.

339
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:45,835
Rym: What we've learned from this is that yes, that's possible.

340
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:46,720
Rym: It's only a matter of time.

341
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:59,459
Scott: This is a good example of not only something that's awesome and a technology that's gonna change the world for a lot of people but I think this is something of an example of wow, that is something that is patentable.

342
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:06,590
Scott: like If we have a patent system, this is what patents are for something It's actually fucking new and actually amazing.

343
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:14,096
Scott: not for someone taking a bunch of stuff that already exists It just happening to be the first one to glue it together, which was obvious to everyone else.

344
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:14,959
Scott: They just didn't do it yet.

345
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:23,921
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

346
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,250
Rym: after you know, there was gonna be a pause there.

347
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,021
Rym: But actually unlike what Scott said before there was no pause there.

348
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:30,843
Scott: Nope.

349
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:31,625
Scott: We didn't do it.

350
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:33,390
Rym: We're going on the wire.

351
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:34,455
Rym: This is live.

352
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:35,941
Rym: We don't have any plan.

353
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:37,367
Rym: So things of the day.

354
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:38,030
Rym: What do you got for me?

355
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,933
Rym: Think of the day Scott.

356
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:47,806
Scott: well water is poison posted this bad boy in the forums and I was so high quality And so impressive that I got to pass it on to anyone who doesn't check it out in the forums.

357
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:55,590
Scott: basically Do name Christopher Hitchens and he was in a debate with Alistair McGrath in October last year.

358
00:21:55,771 --> 00:22:00,015
Rym: I point out that Alistair is one of my favorite names ever Yep, and basically it was the.

359
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:04,727
Scott: it was you know, one of those atheism versus religion debates, you know the old-school happy time, right?

360
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:15,610
Scott: And Basically what someone's done is they took Christopher Hitchens opening statements And by the way Christopher Hitchens is the atheist side of this debate, uh, you know I think we could have left everyone hanging until they listen.

361
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:31,969
Scott: yeah, they they took his opening statement basically for this debate and they made two videos on YouTube that sort of illustrate his opening statements with pictures and graphics of sorts and Not only the opening statements themselves.

362
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:46,493
Scott: Pretty much amazing and I couldn't even think of any way to fight against them Even if I wanted to be on that religious side, right the illustrations add a lot of humor and other things, you know and power to the Statement.

363
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:53,349
Scott: it's worth definitely watching these videos and there's also a link I'm basically linking to our forum for this one.

364
00:22:53,791 --> 00:23:07,285
Scott: It's also Star Fox posted the link to a full video of the debate itself so you can actually watch the whole debate if you're that interested and I'm getting the feeling this is gonna be a high-quality debate because it's a high-quality opening statement.

365
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:12,942
Rym: cuz I really it's not entertaining To watch someone go there's no God and you're stupid someone else go.

366
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:14,207
Rym: There is a God and you're stupid.

367
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:17,980
Rym: Yeah Debates like this are so up my alley.

368
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:22,269
Scott: There are two people who are actually like academic and civil.

369
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:27,190
Scott: Speak intelligently in a in a fair and organized way.

370
00:23:27,954 --> 00:23:30,266
Scott: You know the kind of thing that happens not on the internet.

371
00:23:30,347 --> 00:23:34,064
Rym: Haha Maybe we should just go back to like ancient Athens.

372
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:38,058
Scott: You want your What's it called penis on the Parthenon?

373
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:39,282
Scott: No you think with the wine?

374
00:23:39,302 --> 00:23:41,670
Rym: Oh, actually I'm still thinking about that.

375
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:43,910
Rym: I think I gotta wait till we get a house.

376
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:52,797
Rym: I kind of if I get a house with the sideways chairs with the circuit spiral pillow My thinking is actually if and when I get a house I want to for what.

377
00:23:52,817 --> 00:24:02,409
Rym: I want to furnish the living room not with a big couch Like everyone has like the central black and the coffee table because that's with the sheer number of people We have over so often.

378
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,435
Rym: That's just so restrictive.

379
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:08,130
Rym: and what we can do and how is the hundred beanbag chairs of the major is even worse.

380
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,142
Rym: They take up so much space and offer so little.

381
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:12,950
Rym: they turn into flat crap.

382
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,250
Rym: I gotta have you gotta have the kind of more beans, but then they take up even more space.

383
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:18,741
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

384
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:19,285
Rym: I want though.

385
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:31,822
Rym: I want symposium chairs and then all I need is a big bowl like a big bowl to put in the middle of the room and a bunch of saucers and I Seriously want to host a symposium in the classic sense.

386
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:32,364
Scott: That's all.

387
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:35,375
Scott: you the only the only You're.

388
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,323
Scott: you're steam cleaning the carpet afterwards.

389
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:38,529
Rym: You see you're not.

390
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:41,863
Rym: If you get drunk at a symposium, you're doing it wrong.

391
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:43,190
Scott: I'm talking about spilling the wine.

392
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:47,727
Rym: If anyone spills the wine, there's a giant is a giant bowl and saucers.

393
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:48,550
Scott: It's gonna be spilled.

394
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:49,835
Rym: Well, it'll be a tile room.

395
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:50,759
Scott: So uh-huh.

396
00:24:51,382 --> 00:24:51,864
Scott: All righty, then.

397
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:53,210
Scott: Yeah, then you got him off the floor.

398
00:24:53,632 --> 00:25:01,042
Rym: I'm so about as important and if you and if you stay in the grout purple, you gotta clean that - I'm surprised You remembered that because this is something that's been in my it's.

399
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:05,561
Rym: this has been in my hopper for a long time Ever since I learned what the word symposium actually meant.

400
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:06,947
Scott: All right, we got a thing of the day.

401
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:07,228
Scott: Mr.

402
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:07,710
Scott: Symposium.

403
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:08,514
Rym: Well, I do.

404
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:16,850
Rym: in fact speaking of the exact opposite of a symposium This is this is a video of us performing at an anime convention.

405
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,705
Scott: Oh, come on, what do you give using us as a thing of the day?

406
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:20,529
Scott: That's so shit.

407
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,660
Rym: We're not the thing of the day.

408
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,245
Rym: Here's the deal.

409
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:28,055
Rym: I There are a lot of videos of us on YouTube performing conventions and I was not aware There's not to go watch.

410
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:33,190
Rym: a lot of them are very poorly done Just because you know, it's some punk kid in the audience filming something.

411
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:37,870
Rym: But my thing of the day is not hey watch this video and I wouldn't even recommend you watch the whole thing.

412
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:39,637
Rym: But I want to point something out.

413
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:42,830
Rym: We've talked about this on Tuesdays and Wednesdays mostly Wednesdays.

414
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,390
Rym: But you know our Thursday listeners are a different bunch in general.

415
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:51,450
Rym: A lot of you listen to like all the rest of GeekNights or you only listen to Thursday.

416
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:53,903
Scott: It's kind of weird what goes on with the different days.

417
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,290
Rym: Thursday's a really different day.

418
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,053
Rym: It's kind of a different.

419
00:25:56,093 --> 00:26:00,469
Rym: we we tend to blow Thursday off a lot more and get a lot less formal and a lot more.

420
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:03,657
Scott: I like today Today's super air.

421
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:05,150
Rym: Yeah, but it's weird.

422
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,958
Rym: every time we do an episode like this people like man.

423
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:11,241
Rym: that episode was great and every time we try and do like a Research episodes like wow, that was boring.

424
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:12,368
Scott: I don't get it.

425
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:20,230
Rym: Anyway, so there's a phenomenon that occurs whenever you're in their groups of fans of something and never nowhere.

426
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,970
Rym: Is this more clear than at an anime convention now?

427
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,070
Rym: I want you to watch the beginning of this video because the video quality is awful.

428
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:32,090
Rym: I apologize for that, but we're running this anime match game.

429
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,481
Rym: It's like a game show with we got all the.

430
00:26:34,742 --> 00:26:36,590
Rym: actually the guests up there are pretty hot.

431
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:41,227
Rym: I'll say that the old-looking man is Peter Fernandez the first voice of Speed Racer.

432
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:42,130
Scott: No the English choice.

433
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:44,929
Rym: Yeah, let me tell you that dude's a cool freaking dude.

434
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:49,496
Scott: It's weird cuz like this old man hobbles in and I'm like, oh man, it's that guy I knew he was coming like.

435
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:51,810
Rym: I don't want to hurt him and then he talks.

436
00:26:52,091 --> 00:27:00,246
Scott: He still has like famous old radio voice and it's like wow Like tiny old man with like this crazy voice coming out.

437
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:01,049
Scott: You're like, holy shit.

438
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:04,040
Scott: I need a voice like that so I can be all radio.

439
00:27:04,161 --> 00:27:06,770
Rym: but notice what happens in the beginning of this.

440
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:12,750
Rym: I'm doing you know a match game question and this is one of our like throwaway questions that supposed to be a crowd-pleaser.

441
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,743
Rym: It's not because we the match game was never intended for anyone to actually win it.

442
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:18,970
Rym: It's intended to make people write funny things.

443
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,040
Rym: So the question is I say, you know, this is very blah blah blah.

444
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:30,009
Rym: name for me a Pokemon and I Consider the noise level of the room up until ice.

445
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:43,421
Rym: I asked the question fully and then listen to what happens because it seems like whenever you're at a fan convention Especially anime you can you could we could do an event and we do this at all our panels just to see and kind of Mess with people.

446
00:27:43,685 --> 00:27:49,635
Rym: All right We're gonna talk about something and the crew there's a big crowd hundreds hundreds of people and they're sitting there and they're waiting for me to talk.

447
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:55,549
Rym: and if Scott or I just say like Final Fantasy the crowd loses their shit.

448
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:05,288
Scott: No Final Fantasy 6 Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, oh my god, they said the name of something I like.

449
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:06,170
Scott: it's time to cheer.

450
00:28:07,714 --> 00:28:18,656
Rym: I learned of this phenomenon at the RIT anime club because Luke who was kind of the leader of the club at the time whenever there was a Delay like a technical problem You got to entertain the crowd or they'll fucking kill us.

451
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,117
Rym: cuz that's.

452
00:28:19,217 --> 00:28:20,600
Rym: the crowd was big and dangerous.

453
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:28,042
Rym: yeah, a bunch of anime fans, but If he needed to entertain a crowd on the spot with no preparation.

454
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:30,410
Rym: All he do is go to the crowd.

455
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:40,237
Rym: He'd be like yell out someone who's awesome and then someone would be like Roger Smith from Big O And then he'd be like, all right Who's more awesome than Roger Smith?

456
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:44,949
Rym: and then the crowd would just go crazy and he would just kind of whip them up into this Fury.

457
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:49,130
Rym: Until we are we were ready to go and then we hit play on whatever DVD we were watching.

458
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:54,298
Rym: Yeah, I don't understand this phenomenon but here's an example of it in case you have never seen it.

459
00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:08,644
Scott: if you ever think about where rims actually saying what actually is Going on and look at the reaction people the audience has to what's going on and look how disproportionate it is It's like they react so crazily to so little.

460
00:29:09,186 --> 00:29:10,330
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of scary.

461
00:29:10,593 --> 00:29:20,250
Rym: Wasn't one of our clever questions That wasn't one of the ones with like four sentences of witty like build-up to some amazing funny thing That was name a Pokemon.

462
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:27,373
Rym: The worst thing is people react the same way as people named Pokemon.

463
00:29:27,774 --> 00:29:29,480
Scott: Yeah, okay, man, okay, man.

464
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,365
Scott: So can't help.

465
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:32,376
Scott: what are we doing the show on today?

466
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,140
Rym: I don't know.

467
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:35,626
Scott: So we had to show on something.

468
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:36,107
Scott: Yeah.

469
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:36,951
Rym: Well, let's see.

470
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:38,396
Rym: We were talking.

471
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:39,480
Rym: we could talk about high school.

472
00:29:40,103 --> 00:29:41,248
Rym: How high school has changed?

473
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:42,513
Scott: yeah, but what am I gonna say?

474
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:43,819
Scott: I already said what I had to say.

475
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:45,987
Rym: I got a lot more to say but that's cuz.

476
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:47,131
Rym: my high school was weird.

477
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:51,245
Rym: So like my high school wasn't locked My school wasn't locked.

478
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:52,109
Rym: high schools are locked.

479
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:52,250
Rym: Now.

480
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,255
Rym: You can't get in during the day.

481
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:54,300
Scott: I didn't know that.

482
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:55,240
Rym: Yeah, I can't go outside.

483
00:29:55,281 --> 00:30:00,846
Scott: I think yeah Maybe that's part of the thing is that it's hard for me to say what's different about high school because I don't know about high School now very much.

484
00:30:01,188 --> 00:30:05,381
Scott: I know but I've been to high school and like I I graduate in 2000.

485
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:12,769
Rym: So we're talking like a decade pretty I think the reason I know is that the whole Columbine thing happened while we were in High school and I graduated right.

486
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:17,550
Rym: but the summer after I went to college I actually went back to Michigan for that summer.

487
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,580
Rym: That was the last summer I spent in Michigan.

488
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:24,136
Rym: like that was the last any time I spent in Michigan really.

489
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:39,320
Rym: but I Went back and you know I knew some a lot of the administration and people at this college or God the college a high school and Went back and I wanted to talk to people and I remember one day I just went back over the high school and I tried to walk in and the doors were locked.

490
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,730
Rym: I was like what the fuck all the doors were locked.

491
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:44,180
Rym: So I went to the front office and they're like, who are you?

492
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,670
Rym: I'm like I'm an old Rym.

493
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,604
Rym: I was like Practically valedictorian.

494
00:30:49,624 --> 00:30:50,207
Rym: I was awesome.

495
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:50,971
Rym: Don't you remember me?

496
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:52,740
Rym: And they're like, oh, yeah, we know who you are.

497
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,663
Rym: What the hell you doing here?

498
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:54,788

00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:56,293
Rym: I want to say hi to mr.

Rym: What?

00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:10,384
Rym: You're not a student here.

00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:11,228
Rym: You don't live here.

512
00:31:11,308 --> 00:31:11,930
Rym: You have to leave.

00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,118
Rym: law blah blah blah blah like.

Rym: ah.

515
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,331
Rym: So I went over to the one place.

516
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:19,060
Rym: I knew I could get into the school the band room.

517
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,800
Rym: I just ripped open the secret door that as far as I know is still broken.

518
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:27,825
Rym: you can just open it 24 to 7 and I went in and Talked to my teachers.

519
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,880
Rym: They're like, yeah, if they find you here, they're probably gonna call the police.

520
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:37,000
Rym: I was like what and I remember my teachers telling me how crappy this high school had gotten in like the year and a half.

521
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:39,767
Rym: So yeah high schools are different.

522
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:42,780
Scott: All right, so do you want to do the whole show on that or you think it's not else?

523
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,317
Rym: I don't know.

524
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,864
Rym: All I could do now is enumerate all the things that are different and I don't want to get into that because that also be A lot of man.

525
00:31:48,884 --> 00:31:50,150
Rym: high school was awesome.

526
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,480
Rym: All you kids can't experience what we had.

527
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:57,280
Scott: All right, so let's see what do we have on the calendar here, let's see all you open in the calendar.

528
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,465
Scott: I already had the calendar open.

529
00:31:58,585 --> 00:31:59,669
Scott: It's a spaceship.

530
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,340
Scott: dogfight is scheduled for today, but I don't think we want to do that.

531
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,367
Rym: I look up spaceships.

532
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:04,938
Scott: Yeah, I only know a few.

533
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,594
Scott: Let's see if I were a superhero if I were a super villain.

534
00:32:09,614 --> 00:32:14,707
Scott: Yeah, if I were a pirate Do you really build the calendar for those?

535
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:21,674
Rym: if I worse because we were hurting for Thursdays for so long and then finally Someone in the forum was like what if you were a super villain?

536
00:32:21,714 --> 00:32:22,880
Scott: and we realized that was me.

537
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:27,626
Rym: Yeah, and then we I guess it was you and then we're like, wait a minute Why don't we just do?

538
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:31,205
Rym: those episodes are really popular and they're really easy to do But I don't know.

539
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:34,178
Rym: I don't feel like doing one of those that takes that's a high-energy episode.

540
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:35,620
Rym: Yeah I don't have high energy.

541
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,740
Scott: There's a crime and punishment where I guess we talked about like dostoevsky and what's wrong with them and that sort of thing.

542
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,125
Rym: Yeah, or we could talk about the book.

543
00:32:42,265 --> 00:32:43,048
Scott: I've never read the book.

544
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,256
Scott: What it's big and long.

545
00:32:45,457 --> 00:32:46,340
Rym: It's really good.

546
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,066
Rym: Have you read anything by him?

547
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:49,151
Scott: No, I know he is.

548
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:50,496
Scott: I know his books.

549
00:32:50,576 --> 00:32:51,319
Scott: I've never read them.

550
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:53,670
Rym: Oh, it's got you got to read crime and punishment.

551
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,474
Scott: That's not gonna happen.

552
00:32:54,695 --> 00:32:55,520
Rym: It's a good book.

553
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,434
Scott: All right, I'll read that and I'm just gonna let that Prince of Nothing sit there.

554
00:32:58,454 --> 00:32:59,640
Rym: God read the Prince of Nothing first.

555
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:00,388
Rym: It's a better book.

556
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,758
Rym: Oh Man, I wanted to this Thursday about the Prince of Nothing, but you got to read it.

557
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:06,086
Scott: I'll read it something.

558
00:33:06,146 --> 00:33:07,473
Rym: actually it's something all of tall.

559
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:09,065
Rym: you listeners out there I want.

560
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:10,779
Scott: you know, I would have read it sooner But you know what?

561
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:16,988
Scott: I'm almost done with Ace Attorney when I was gonna face 34 and as soon as I finished it I was maybe gonna read Prince of Nothing, but you know what?

562
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:19,418
Scott: No, Krista Chronicles DS shows up.

563
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:22,756
Rym: Oh, well I'm gonna tell you all right now everyone out there.

564
00:33:22,797 --> 00:33:23,320
Rym: There's a book.

565
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:27,189
Rym: It is called the darkness that comes before the Prince of Nothing.

566
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,993
Rym: It's the first in a series.

567
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:30,837
Rym: it is written by our Scott backer.

568
00:33:30,857 --> 00:33:35,370
Rym: I Cannot recommend this book to you highly enough.

569
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:38,300
Scott: Do you want to set the Amazon affiliate thing that we talked about?

570
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,283
Rym: We should set that up.

571
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:39,565
Rym: Yeah.

572
00:33:39,826 --> 00:33:42,739
Scott: Well, basically like I know people out there, right?

573
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:48,899
Scott: We have always said we don't make money on the show and we don't want to make money on the show We're not gonna advertise or anything like that, right?

574
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,720
Scott: But apparently, you know, the Amazon affiliate program has been around for a long time.

575
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,040
Scott: If you don't know what it is, basically it allows you to make links to Amazon.

576
00:33:57,482 --> 00:34:00,720
Scott: So and those links sort of give you money.

577
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:08,955
Scott: So for example, if I wanted to link to say this Prince of Nothing book And I put a link to the Prince of Nothing book on Amazon on our website, right?

578
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:12,659
Scott: I Could just make a link to the book on Amazon.

579
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,063
Scott: there's nothing stopped me from doing that.

580
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:27,239
Scott: but the affiliate program means I do a special link and what happens is if I was to Click on that link a special link and then buy the book Amazon would know hey someone bought this book and Scott sent them here.

581
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:32,159
Scott: I'm gonna give Scott like, you know, ten or twenty percent of the price of that book.

582
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,587
Rym: I think it's a lot less than that.

583
00:34:33,768 --> 00:34:35,134
Scott: It's actually a quite a bit.

584
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:36,380
Scott: It's a significant discount.

585
00:34:36,862 --> 00:34:41,620
Scott: So you could buy like books from yourself and save money on Amazon.

586
00:34:42,463 --> 00:34:43,085
Scott: Cuz they'll just.

587
00:34:43,146 --> 00:34:46,800
Scott: it's basically like an automatic rebate if you set up the affiliate program for yourself.

588
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:49,233
Rym: Well, anyway, I think you can also.

589
00:34:49,514 --> 00:34:59,691
Scott: the real idea of it Is that like you listeners would buy books that we told you to buy or not just books but DVDs CDs Whatever and you click on the links at front recruit calm.

590
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:02,240
Scott: you then buy the product and then we get money.

591
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:08,500
Rym: Now I guess we're thinking about doing this partly because we don't have any other way to make money off a GeekNights.

592
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:16,500
Rym: And well as we've said clearly and repeatedly we will never ever advertise in GeekNights on the website anything ever.

593
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:17,679
Scott: Nope, it's not gonna happen.

594
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:28,770
Rym: So we figure basically we're warning you now because if we do this We're pretty much we don't want like unlike a lot of other people who just throw these links in willy-nilly like in foreign posts and everything To try to just get the money and

595
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,140
Scott: they don't tell you what they're doing.

596
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,747
Scott: They're just put a link there to Amazon.

597
00:35:31,787 --> 00:35:33,313
Scott: You don't realize that they're making money off.

598
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,880
Rym: We're gonna be so upfront about this.

599
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,340
Scott: We're gonna be like if you click this link and buy the book we will make money.

600
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:41,100
Scott: You can click this link to buy the book and we won't get money.

601
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:45,117
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna totally be upfront with it, but we just give the option out there.

602
00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:46,825
Rym: Yeah, of course We're gonna start selling.

603
00:35:46,865 --> 00:35:49,980
Scott: also use it to buy stuff for a discount for ourselves.

604
00:35:50,201 --> 00:35:50,863
Rym: Yeah, of course.

605
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:53,953
Rym: I did just buy another copy of the darkness that comes before.

606
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:55,037
Scott: we have one.

607
00:35:55,057 --> 00:35:55,639
Scott: What do you need to?

608
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:55,980
Rym: I bought?

609
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:56,964
Rym: The hardcover one.

610
00:35:56,984 --> 00:35:57,768
Rym: I couldn't get anywhere.

611
00:35:57,828 --> 00:36:00,600
Rym: so I bought it used in good condition for really little money.

612
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:04,839
Scott: I guess what needs a hardcover for hardcover suck because it's a really good book.

613
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:06,146
Scott: That doesn't mean anything.

614
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:06,870
Scott: hardcover suck.

615
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:08,579
Rym: the hardcover is gonna be my lending copy.

616
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,658
Scott: Why don't you an episode about why I could argue that hardcover suck?

617
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,462
Rym: actually You know what?

618
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,332
Rym: If a book is thicker than about an inch.

619
00:36:14,593 --> 00:36:15,860
Rym: I really prefer a hardcover.

620
00:36:16,061 --> 00:36:18,188
Scott: I never prefer a hardcover and here's why.

621
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:19,051
Scott: number one.

622
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:19,975
Scott: It's more expensive.

623
00:36:20,015 --> 00:36:23,648
Scott: not if you buy it used number Yes, but the same can be said for paperback.

624
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:26,620
Scott: number two, it takes up more physical space.

625
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:27,518
Rym: It's worth it.

626
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:36,857
Rym: If you're reading a book that's more than an inch thick or if it's two inches thick Without the hardcover the thing falls apart and sucks to read and it only falls apart if the binding is shitty.

627
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:40,714
Scott: binding can be shitty On hardcovers - I've had hardcovers fall off just as much as soft.

628
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:44,914
Scott: I haven't only old ones Yeah, but if the binding is shitty does not?

629
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,140
Scott: you know that the binding is shitty?

630
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,766
Scott: It doesn't matter what kind of binding it is.

631
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:48,730
Scott: It's a shitty binding.

632
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:49,734
Rym: Whatever.

633
00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:50,457
Rym: I disagree with you.

634
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:51,160
Rym: I like hardcovers.

635
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:52,380
Scott: I don't like hardcovers ever.

636
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,003
Scott: I would always.

637
00:36:53,084 --> 00:36:58,887
Scott: the only time I get a hardcover actually is I actually buy the Walking Dead in hardcover because it's so much cheaper.

638
00:36:59,147 --> 00:37:07,107
Rym: Anyway, anyway our Scott backer the Prince of Nothing the darkness that comes before Serious hardcore amazing fantasy.

639
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:09,455
Rym: I I'm amazed by these books.

640
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:10,640
Rym: I think I talked about him before.

641
00:37:11,246 --> 00:37:19,167
Rym: Yeah, yes But the reason I'm gonna tell you all to get these books and read them again is because I'm working on Getting an interview with the author.

642
00:37:19,187 --> 00:37:29,844
Rym: No, and I've seen other interviews with him and There's no question that I had was not already asked Answered.

643
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:41,771
Rym: so if any of you have questions for the author Let us know I guess and then I'll have to read the book and then that'll push me more and more toward actually getting an Interview or trying to get an interview.

644
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:42,999
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I can get one.

645
00:37:43,401 --> 00:37:49,467
Rym: Also, if any of you have questions for Luke Crane the god of role-playing Then I don't think he's the god.

646
00:37:49,507 --> 00:37:51,235
Scott: I think he's like the rock star of rope.

647
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:54,026
Scott: Yeah, he's definitely the rocks The rock star of tabletop role-playing.

648
00:37:54,468 --> 00:37:56,957
Rym: Yeah, we're gonna interview him again soon.

649
00:37:57,037 --> 00:37:57,940
Rym: So send us your questions.

650
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,948
Rym: We'll talk about that on Tuesday, I guess.

651
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,735
Scott: All right, so we're not gonna talk about that.

652
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:03,927
Rym: I Guess I could talk about it.

653
00:38:03,968 --> 00:38:04,673
Rym: You could just sit there.

654
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:08,891
Scott: Yeah Okay, so let's check the forum thread of show ideas.

655
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:09,473
Rym: Oh great.

656
00:38:09,513 --> 00:38:10,537
Rym: This is gonna go nowhere.

657
00:38:10,557 --> 00:38:12,593
Rym: Yeah, I know Let me pull it up to.

658
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:13,017
Rym: we can.

659
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:14,987
Rym: You see guys out there.

00:38:15,007 --> 00:38:15,750
Rym: This is what happens.

661
00:38:15,971 --> 00:38:16,714
Rym: This is what we do.

662
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:18,724
Rym: part of the reason we're doing This is we're just.

663
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:26,860
Rym: this is what we would be doing if We didn't have a show idea and we weren't tired and we weren't worried about getting the show done and going to bed or whatever.

664
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,539
Rym: I'm in brawl.

665
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:32,374
Rym: We would just have this discussion for an hour and then we do the show on whatever we decided.

666
00:38:32,654 --> 00:38:34,660
Scott: Thursday series Disney animated films.

667
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,805
Scott: We thought of that before.

668
00:38:35,826 --> 00:38:42,592
Scott: I could do a show on Dumbo probably or Aladdin But we sort of skipped out of the movie phase.

669
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,340
Scott: you want to go back to the movie phase a little bit.

670
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:52,609
Rym: I don't got to watch movies Scott who's never seen a strange days and How to run an online community?

Scott: that's a Monday.

673
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:56,799
Rym: Yes, that's not a suggestion.

Rym: well Okay, you might want to do continue the series.

00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:43,320
Scott: Yeah, that's really cool.

696
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:49,220
Rym: Also a lot of people as is my man a lot of people however think Tesla accomplished a lot more than he actually did.

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,910
Scott: That is true is not?

698
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:52,500

701
00:39:57,681 --> 00:40:01,720

702
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:02,844
Scott: Yeah, okay.

703
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:03,326

710
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:27,020
Rym: Oh, I could go over there and make you some music.

711
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:28,304
Rym: I don't know if you want me to.

712
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:30,572
Scott: yeah, someone wants to do an Akira show.

713
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:32,459
Scott: That's a Wednesday, but you still haven't read that.

714
00:40:33,441 --> 00:40:35,168
Rym: Now, yeah, we could do just the movie first.

715
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,116
Scott: I haven't watched the movie in so long.

716
00:40:37,156 --> 00:40:37,819
Scott: I didn't get the DVD.

717
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:40,710
Scott: I could get the DVDs at least actually a good DVD.

718
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,777
Rym: We can watch it on Netflix on demand anytime.

719
00:40:42,837 --> 00:40:43,620
Rym: Is it really on there?

720
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,651
Rym: Yeah, it's the dub but it's.

721
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:46,515
Scott: no that doesn't count.

722
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:48,445
Rym: Tell us not that bad.

723
00:40:48,686 --> 00:40:50,956
Scott: I know but especially the new dub is not that bad.

724
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:51,317
Scott: Yeah.

725
00:40:51,538 --> 00:40:55,925
Scott: Yeah So I probably actually the new dub is better than the old dub There's no doubt.

726
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,315
Scott: but I accept my style.

727
00:40:57,376 --> 00:40:57,980
Scott: I have nostalgia.

728
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:06,318
Scott: I have a nostalgia for the old dub and the new dub sort of bothers me because the nostalgia Hey, you always yell at me when there's nostalgia for a dog because I at least I admit it.

729
00:41:06,961 --> 00:41:14,478
Scott: Well, it depends because some dubs like the difference between saying that what though the old ones better and saying the old one isn't better But I like it better.

730
00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:24,133
Rym: for There are some dubs like where the old dub or the American dub Was probably worse on a technical scale and worse on an accuracy scale.

731
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:32,740
Rym: then newer dubs of newer shows But they were just done better and with more spirit or more emotion or better acting and just more.

732
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,283
Rym: I don't know.

733
00:41:33,323 --> 00:41:34,729
Rym: Sometimes the old stuff is better.

734
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,940
Scott: All right, let's see the Constitution.

735
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,585
Scott: Yeah, it takes more than a show.

736
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:43,380
Scott: We need like one show per you realize amendment and then one show per article.

737
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:45,891
Rym: You realize we've already like we're.

738
00:41:46,052 --> 00:41:52,500
Rym: whenever we finally do shows on politics We probably need to do a multi-part series on federalism in and of itself.

739
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:55,350
Rym: How about the idea of democracy?

740
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,658
Rym: democracy itself would take us a month to cover God?

741
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,346
Scott: sitcoms Simpson Seinfeld, that's it.

742
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:03,534
Rym: Uh, I don't know the credit stones.

743
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:04,397
Rym: the critic was good.

744
00:42:04,437 --> 00:42:05,160
Scott: Is that a sitcom?

745
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:07,301
Rym: What did?

746
00:42:07,322 --> 00:42:08,086
Rym: what did what?

747
00:42:08,106 --> 00:42:09,514
Rym: what constant you realize got?

748
00:42:09,534 --> 00:42:18,789
Rym: sitcom means a situational comedy a comedy wherein humor can be derived from situations in which Critic is more of a character comedy than a situation comedy.

749
00:42:19,893 --> 00:42:21,840
Rym: Uh, but they put the character in situations.

750
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,511
Scott: Seinfeld, I don't know.

751
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:27,508
Rym: Ah We should do Sean Seinfeld.

752
00:42:28,051 --> 00:42:29,056
Scott: That's not a bad show.

753
00:42:29,076 --> 00:42:29,680
Rym: That's a good show.

754
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:30,906

Rym: I could do a show on that but it's not that interesting.

776
00:43:29,282 --> 00:43:30,619
Rym: There's the extent of what I could do.

777
00:43:31,021 --> 00:43:36,020
Rym: I could tell you all the different kinds of infinity and describe what they are to the best of my knowledge.

778
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,191
Scott: Utopian and dystopian futures.

Scott: But what are we gonna are we just gonna talk about?

781
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,319

Scott: No fraternities.

00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:51,475
Scott: I could talk about that.

785
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,423
Rym: You should do a show just on 1984.

786
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,107
Scott: Yeah, we could do that.

787
00:43:54,248 --> 00:43:55,134

788
00:43:55,295 --> 00:43:55,878

00:44:05,074 --> 00:44:06,320
Scott: That was a long time ago.

794
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,310
Rym: I think we should read it again and then do a show on it.

00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:09,798
Scott: We can get means we gotta get it.

796

Rym: Oh, no, I went to one in Arizona to.

812
00:44:43,752 --> 00:44:48,488
Scott: paranormal experiences Don't exist because they're not real.

813
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:53,714
Rym: Ah, I think I could do a good show along those lines though Being bored at work.

814
00:44:53,936 --> 00:44:54,219
Scott: You mean?

815
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,852
Rym: Every day why don't see you get a job like I have?

816
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,320
Rym: I have not been bored at work ever.

817
00:44:59,922 --> 00:45:00,987
Scott: I actually I see.

818
00:45:01,007 --> 00:45:13,517
Scott: the thing is I actually have work to do at work and it's not boring but I'm just kind of man like I'll sit there and just sort of read my email and read the forum and then put my head on my desk and when I could be doing work and I kind of want to do but I just kind of go

819
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:15,665
Rym: a Stochicon episode.

820
00:45:15,685 --> 00:45:16,126
Rym: we can do.

821
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,030
Scott: we have to do that.

822
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,575
Scott: that has to be done things.

823
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:19,960
Scott: I miss as a child.

824
00:45:20,141 --> 00:45:21,065
Scott: I'm not a child.

825
00:45:21,105 --> 00:45:22,291
Scott: So I don't miss anything.

826
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,300
Scott: I could miss things from childhood.

827
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,892
Scott: I miss having no responsibility in plenty of free time.

828
00:45:27,912 --> 00:45:30,120
Scott: How about and having someone cooking clean for me?

829
00:45:30,301 --> 00:45:30,648
Scott: Yeah, that was.

830
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:31,742
Scott: that was good God.

831
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:39,151
Rym: is that in terms of if I look at that part like just from that perspective When I was in high school, I had infinite resources.

832
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:42,120
Rym: as far as you know, reasonable resources were available.

833
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:50,180
Rym: I had infinite free time zero Responsibility and I could do whatever I want whenever I wanted any time and no one would say anything.

834
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,674
Scott: Oh God pizza and Italian food Mexican food Chinese food Japanese.

835
00:45:54,035 --> 00:45:54,276
Scott: What's it?

836
00:45:54,297 --> 00:45:55,140
Scott: the food people?

837
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,264
Rym: We've done a bunch of food.

838
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:57,952
Scott: I'm telling you someone out there.

839
00:45:58,012 --> 00:45:59,620
Scott: We need some more food podcasts.

840
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,129
Scott: There's a demand for food podcast that is unfulfilled.

841
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:05,180
Scott: We should make like the food podcast network.

842
00:46:05,381 --> 00:46:10,086
Scott: I think I could make a food network would sue us, but we should make the food podcast network I think I could make.

843
00:46:10,126 --> 00:46:16,400
Rym: if I weren't doing GeekNights and I had free time I think I could make a pretty good like once every other week or once a week food.

844
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,186
Scott: But see I wouldn't.

845
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:28,667
Scott: actually if I made a food podcast I wouldn't say anything about food because I'm not qualified But all I would do is research culinary people not re-interview culinary people from around the world And I would ask them about their cooking and such.

846
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,915
Rym: why ice hockey is awesome.

847
00:46:31,015 --> 00:46:32,400
Rym: Oh, no, he heard that episode.

848
00:46:32,683 --> 00:46:34,178
Rym: He wants to talk about RIT hockey.

849
00:46:35,479 --> 00:46:38,683
Rym: Uh Hockey I could do a show on RIT.

850
00:46:39,504 --> 00:46:42,448
Scott: Hey, that's what this is.

851
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,090
Rym: That is hit somebody.

852
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:47,116
Scott: You gotta do you know what?

853
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:56,845
Rym: I suddenly I really miss being able to yell hit somebody And have someone out there hit somebody directly because I said it.

854
00:46:56,905 --> 00:47:00,384
Rym: I don't think God we got to do a show Even at the NHL.

855
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:01,090
Scott: that won't happen.

856
00:47:01,491 --> 00:47:09,770
Rym: Yeah, remember at RIT hockey if you were sitting in the corner and you yell remember you can't just yell hit somebody you have To yell it like that hit somebody.

857
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:15,204
Rym: Someone will hit someone as soon as they can usually getting interference call.

858
00:47:15,405 --> 00:47:17,231
Scott: Yes for the evil refs We would you.

859
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:18,094
Rym: how the evil around?

860
00:47:18,274 --> 00:47:23,942
Rym: how dare they enforce the rules against us and how dare they not call that cheap shot From the other team.

861
00:47:24,023 --> 00:47:27,603
Scott: Okay Someone says we should do a Monty Python show next Thursday.

862
00:47:27,643 --> 00:47:28,326
Scott: Monty Python.

863
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:28,888
Rym: Definitely.

864
00:47:28,928 --> 00:47:29,350
Scott: There we go.

865
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:33,767
Rym: I learned one thing when to go lock Emily's friend to Gucci Sun was visiting from Japan.

866
00:47:33,787 --> 00:47:36,821
Rym: We learned something They know about Monty Python in Japan.

867
00:47:37,343 --> 00:47:38,770
Scott: They don't have anything.

868
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:42,083
Scott: Let me there's nothing we have that they want that they don't talk.

869
00:47:42,304 --> 00:47:43,750
Rym: talking to this kid was fascinating.

870
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:46,119
Rym: I should talk about this on a Wednesday, but we learned a couple of things.

871
00:47:46,299 --> 00:48:00,350
Rym: one as far as the average Japanese anime fan is As far as they would consider our anime tastes and collection We are old fucking men who watch old obscure weird stuff that kids they had never even heard of or don't care about.

872
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:01,857
Scott: Yes, pretty much like that.

873
00:48:01,897 --> 00:48:03,767
Rym: We know more about anime than we should.

874
00:48:03,787 --> 00:48:12,610
Scott: Yep And also the only thing that the Japanese people want from America that they don't have is iPhones and we don't even want iPhone.

875
00:48:13,112 --> 00:48:14,740
Scott: Yes, you can have the iPhones take them.

876
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,404
Scott: We don't need them.

877
00:48:15,464 --> 00:48:20,569
Rym: He was like, yeah Like they're like we're like all men and he's showing us like his DS games like.

878
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:25,989
Scott: oh He's got like this game by Atlas that is like this amazing like maze game that looks like Dungeon Master.

879
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:29,436
Scott: and I'm like Oh, look at that maze I want that game so bad.

880
00:48:29,456 --> 00:48:32,266
Rym: and then we talked to him and we realized that there no there's.

881
00:48:32,447 --> 00:48:36,393
Rym: every game that is good comes out in Japan and Possibly America.

882
00:48:36,795 --> 00:48:41,010
Rym: no game that is good comes out in America not Japan except PC games.

883
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:43,362
Rym: That's because PC gaming barely exists in Japan.

884
00:48:43,865 --> 00:48:44,770
Scott: Yeah, there's a barrel.

885
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,327
Scott: Yeah, they don't have portal but they don't know about it to want it.

886
00:48:48,609 --> 00:48:49,593
Rym: god It was funny.

887
00:48:49,834 --> 00:48:56,510
Rym: Emily was trying to explain to him what portal was but you know offhand You don't know the word for like wormhole in Japanese.

888
00:48:56,992 --> 00:49:00,445
Rym: So it was like it's a game but instead of shooting bullets you shoot doors.

889
00:49:00,766 --> 00:49:01,770
Rym: what like front doors?

890
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:04,980
Rym: No, like like holes like explosions.

891
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,829
Scott: No, like like the entrance to should I just showed it to him?

892
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:08,270
Rym: No, she did.

893
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:08,916
Rym: She was like fine.

894
00:49:08,956 --> 00:49:13,574
Rym: Never mind here YouTube video Dawg.

895
00:49:14,392 --> 00:49:22,810
Rym: Yeah, ah, yeah, yeah, I do a show about Chianti But I don't think anyone else wants to have we have we managed to talk long enough about what to do a show on that.

896
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:24,304
Scott: We've managed to kill the show yet.

897
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:24,990
Rym: You know what?

898
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,328
Rym: I kind of want to make my french toast holla and some eggs to go with that.

899
00:49:28,408 --> 00:49:37,850
Rym: So You have gotten a rare insight into the creative process of GeekNights Yeah, and a total cop-out from some lazy ass fools.

900
00:49:38,332 --> 00:49:40,238
Rym: I'll tell you all something scary and you might be.

901
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:47,299
Rym: it might have sounded like we were talking to you because When we're alone we sound like this.

902
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:54,970
Rym: when when our friends are over we sound like this like it might sound weird But we noticed this way back at RIT when the way the room was set up.

903
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:02,600
Rym: We'd all be in the living room of our apartment because everyone hung out in our apartment our tiny ass little smelly Dank basement apartment.

904
00:50:02,882 --> 00:50:04,330
Scott: Oh the dank mo the dank.

905
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:05,315
Rym: What about the dank?

906
00:50:05,778 --> 00:50:12,110
Rym: but everyone would sit like in the living room But it's kind of had our computers like against the far wall and our desks through there.

907
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:15,538
Rym: So we'd sit in our computer chairs because you know We got to use every possible place.

908
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,949
Rym: someone can sit or stand or no one's gonna fit.

909
00:50:18,732 --> 00:50:32,857
Rym: So we would sit kind of facing each other and like a 45 degree angle half facing each other Half facing the front row crew and extended Visigothic community the Visigoths the Ostrogoths the Vandals everyone and We would talk.

910
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:35,330
Rym: it was almost like we were different.

911
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:40,246
Rym: It was like a forum debate and everyone else was the audience and like a burning wheel duel of wits.

912
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:53,110
Rym: and it wasn't just us Other people would do this too, but it got to the point where whenever any of us talk to each other We almost always talk as though there's a third neutral party who was evaluating us and we were trying to convince them not each other.

913
00:50:53,350 --> 00:51:04,304
Scott: Mm-hmm, and it's kind of weird sometimes but if you were in the room with us Party you agree that like Rym should like end this episode and we should go eat right and go to bed.
