00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,678
Rym: It's Thursday January 31st.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,581
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:16,169
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is geek house.

4
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:19,569
Rym: tonight We talk about the GeekNights geek house that may someday be.

5
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:24,658
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:35,127
Rym: You know I'm kind of impressed as to up how much effort is going into this door fortress succession game that our forum Forumites I guess have started up now.

7
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:39,460
Scott: Yeah, you know people unlike us are passionate about things.

8
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:41,984
Rym: Uh Speak for yourself.

9
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:46,159
Rym: You're the only one who's mad about everything in the world lately man, man, man.

10
00:00:46,944 --> 00:00:48,674
Rym: But seriously that the thing is.

11
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:52,780
Rym: I think part of it's that One thing that I don't have anymore is a whole bunch of free time.

12
00:00:52,881 --> 00:01:01,000
Rym: And if I was in college like say I was in college right say we're both still back at RIT And we weren't doing GeekNights, but something like GeekNights existed, and we listened to it.

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,446
Rym: We were hanging out in those forums.

14
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:05,940
Rym: We would be doing the same things that these kids are doing now in our forums.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,694
Rym: Yeah pretty much we would have like this dwarf Empire and ah man dwarf Empire.

16
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:13,780
Scott: I would have multiple dwarf empires.

17
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,270
Rym: God dwarf fortress would have been the end.

18
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,100
Rym: of course you know what tribes - was the end of me?

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,453
Rym: I didn't go to class for like a month after that game came out.

20
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,540
Rym: Yeah, you did Barely, I didn't go to class often.

21
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:27,246
Scott: I would come back from class.

22
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:28,973
Scott: play play play play play play play.

23
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:30,740
Scott: go to class come back play play play play play.

24
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:36,458
Rym: Yeah, and I'd skip all the non-essential classes like labs or Friday classes or Monday classes.

25
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:37,220
Scott: yeah.

26
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:44,144
Rym: But yeah, I mean seriously we talked about this on Tuesday, but just in case you Thursday listeners Don't know much about the video games.

27
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:48,960
Rym: I'm not saying so much you have to play it, but there's a thing called dwarf fortress.

28
00:01:49,102 --> 00:02:01,432
Rym: I recommend you look in the forums And you look at what these people are doing because I feel as though if you're not a gamer Or you're not willing to put forth the time and effort Reading about a game of dwarf fortress is more fun than playing it.

29
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:02,094
Scott: Well.

30
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:11,015
Scott: I think that definitely the the the Sort of metagame of having a forum thread and sharing the save files and all that business.

31
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:14,208
Scott: it definitely Enhances the game itself.

32
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:19,100
Scott: It's like oh the game on its own is okay But then you add this and it's suddenly super awesome.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,026
Scott: And it's like ah who would have thought that there'd be a game where you could add your own bits to it to make it Awesome?

34
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,660
Rym: oh you mean like role-playing?

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,117
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

36
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:39,579
Rym: Anyway, the other thing I have to say also related to the forums Is that get a lot of new people in the forums and now that we've identified a problem that was slowing the?

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,752
Rym: Forums down you might have noticed that they're a lot faster lately.

38
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:48,037
Rym: not gonna say what the problem was But we both feel kind of stupid, but I'm not sure exactly what the problem was.

39
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:50,265
Scott: oh There was a. that was a different problem.

40
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:51,449
Rym: Oh, there's another problem.

41
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:51,730
Rym: Well.

42
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,517
Scott: No they were just you know general thing.

43
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:54,540
Scott: there were many factors.

44
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:58,390
Rym: I'll explain it this way This is something that happens commonly on Linux.

45
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,153
Rym: like like.

46
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:07,519
Rym: you won't happen on your desktop PC But if you're running a Linux server This is going to happen to you at some point, so yeah be warned You'll see this someday.

47
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:15,540
Rym: You got a demon a little demon and he sits there And he does stuff for your demons a program that stays open all the time and does stuff for you in the background.

48
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:19,130
Rym: So we got a little demon that handles the database for the forum.

49
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:29,805
Rym: well for whatever reason there were two demons And one of them was just lazing about and And eating CPU and eating RAM and the other one was doing all the work And we don't know why.

50
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:32,059
Rym: there were two, but we murdered one of them and everything's finding it.

51
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,586
Rym: well We killed it.

52
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,719
Rym: Yeah with the sort of nines.

53
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:37,908
Scott: So now I didn't use any nines.

54
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:40,380
Scott: you didn't have to know because I know what the fuck I'm doing.

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,822
Scott: I don't need.

56
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:42,550
Scott: I don't need to use nine nights of her amateurs.

57
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:44,600
Rym: I had to use a nine the other day at work.

58
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,185
Rym: I'd I'd weave the amateur.

59
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:47,330
Rym: there's what happened.

60
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,256
Rym: I had a demon wouldn't die right?

61
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:50,240
Rym: it was a weird state.

62
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:51,647
Rym: I killed it in world.

63
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:54,420
Rym: the real way to kill it with within the program didn't work.

64
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,576
Rym: And I killed didn't work, and it was pretty much not responsive to anything.

65
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:02,322
Rym: so I kill 90 Amateur.

66
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,124
Rym: what would you have done?

67
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:06,675
Scott: I would have investigated exactly why it was all hung.

68
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:08,220
Rym: Oh, I knew exactly why it was hung.

69
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:09,184
Scott: Why was it hung up?

70
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:12,500
Rym: it all complicated thing that no one on a Thursday wants to hear about right?

71
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:19,505
Scott: Well, you know if I if I would figure based on that thing I would figure out a way to Get it to kill with normally there There was no way.

72
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:21,440
Rym: it was deadlocked in a way that we could reduce the ways.

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,318
Scott: You don't know because you are not wise in the ways of writing to see.

74
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:27,511
Rym: You're not gonna find a way to fix that one.

75
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:29,000
Rym: Yeah, anyway anyway.

76
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:41,232
Rym: So in regards to the forums however in also with them being faster There's a lot of people joining the forums lately and as you might have known there is now in auto-humiliate option that mr.

77
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:47,239
Rym: Period has access to a Mind your grammar mind your spelling to all you new listeners if you're gonna go.

78
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:59,440
Scott: Yeah, I guess we haven't really talked about this since like the begin early days of the show and you know one person out there You know who got the the virtual dunce cap is probably thinking we're singling them out, but we're not we're not.

79
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,383
Scott: You're like.

80
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:06,080
Scott: there are like ten other new people who also are unawares and might also receive the dunce cap.

81
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,280
Rym: But plus seriously due to as the dunce cap now you are neither the first nor the worst by any means.

82
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:20,016
Scott: I don't feel too bad no, but basically we enforce Correct grammar and spelling on the forum for two reasons.

83
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:32,843
Scott: reason number one We don't want our form to be like the penny arcade forums, or it's just oMG woot poop shit cock right and There's not a lot of ways to do that without you know difficulty.

84
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:47,013
Scott: the second reason is if you even if you know you're You know good at grammar and spelling if we enforce good grammar and spelling and we sort of give an incentive to have you Spell and grammar correctly when you post something in the forum.

85
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:47,976
Scott: You're gonna reread it.

86
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:54,814
Scott: You're gonna proofread it You're gonna think about it And hopefully that will get people to only post things that they really.

87
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:59,049
Scott: you're not gonna post something unless you really Took time on what you're gonna say.

88
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,769
Scott: you know if it's a serious threat in a non serious threat You can just be like woot what you know.

89
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,399
Rym: I mean you've definitely noticed that mr.

90
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,820
Rym: Period and myself and Scott and waters poison are very so it really depends on what the conversation is.

91
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,092
Rym: It's okay to use lol oMG.

92
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:14,680
Rym: It's an lol oMG thread.

93
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:15,764
Rym: It's common sense.

94
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:20,660
Rym: that's why the only rule on the forum is post intelligently and don't be annoying.

95
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:30,999
Scott: Yeah, so you know we if you put the time in to spell and grammaticize something correctly that means you probably put in the thought Into what you're actually saying and you'll say something better.

96
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:34,778
Rym: Yeah, so we always say we haven't said this recently, but join the forums.

97
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:35,823
Rym: They're awesome They really are.

98
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:43,319
Rym: there's a lot of people and they're faster now than they were and they're really rocking And you're probably gonna find someone you you like and make some internet friends in there.

99
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,380
Rym: Internet friends great, but you'll also make convention friends as people has been happening more and more.

100
00:06:48,480 --> 00:07:01,109
Rym: But I will warn you if you're going to join the forums If you can't write and you don't understand the English language in some form You're not gonna enjoy yourself there.

101
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:06,129
Scott: a lot of people who have English as a second language have Improved their English greatly in them forums.

102
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,840
Scott: Yes, but if you don't know English at all, that's gonna be a problem.

103
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:10,467
Scott: And then why are you listening to this?

104
00:07:10,768 --> 00:07:13,299
Scott: Who did you just hearing people go doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo?

105
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,120
Rym: Maybe maybe they just really like the American accent because I could listen to about an albionic person talk.

106
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:23,680
Scott: But there's being a language, you know, mostly but it depends mostly.

107
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:30,773
Rym: Oh Plus I can listen to Russian talking pretty much forever and I have no idea what they're saying.

108
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:33,604
Rym: I'm sorry Pockner ease Pockner ease Okay.

109
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:34,939
Rym: Yeah, I don't know what that Russia is.

110
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:36,828
Scott: Do you ever really made up?

111
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:38,334
Scott: were ever real news over there?

112
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,519
Rym: All right, I got a real news.

113
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:47,080
Rym: now I want to talk about the Democratic presidential primaries, but Scott doesn't care about politics and the discussion would have been.

114
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:49,227
Rym: Here's the discussion Rym.

115
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:50,973
Rym: Oh my god, blah blah blah Barack.

116
00:07:50,993 --> 00:07:54,465
Rym: Oh my god, Florida, Michigan blah Scott It doesn't matter.

117
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:55,809
Scott: There's nothing you can do about it.

118
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,993
Scott: It's no different than this.

119
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,398
Rym: I can I've donated money.

120
00:07:58,438 --> 00:07:59,000
Rym: I'm gonna vote.

121
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,029
Rym: I'm interested this history unfolding.

122
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:03,178
Scott: But anyway, yeah, I know different than why.

123
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,119
Rym: anyway Yes, it is anyway.

124
00:08:05,722 --> 00:08:12,491
Rym: I'm going to talk about an issue related to politics and related to the elections that Will not involve the names of any candidates.

125
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:14,300
Rym: So Scott won't zone out into my land.

126
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,664
Scott: We'll see what this is.

127
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:19,997
Rym: And also I love the ACLU right the American Civil Liberties Union.

128
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:20,800
Scott: They're mostly good.

129
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:21,645
Rym: I'm a member.

130
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:23,879
Rym: I donate money to them on a semi-regular basis.

131
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:27,640
Rym: However, they do not always do the smart thing.

132
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:29,484
Scott: No Not always Now the product.

133
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:35,589
Rym: but the thing is I agree with them no matter what in the end because they always stand up for people's rights Even if those rights may be bad or stupid.

134
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:40,889
Scott: they always kind of well see when they stand up for like You know the free speech rights of like a KKK person.

135
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:47,249
Scott: I'm like, okay, but sometimes they do stuff where it's like, okay No, actually that shouldn't be a right and it's not.

136
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:47,971
Scott: what are you doing?

137
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:48,533
Rym: Yeah.

138
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:52,046
Rym: Yeah, but they they generally they Do more good than harm.

139
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:52,951
Scott: Yes, they do.

140
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,640
Scott: They do more good than than the bad.

141
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,534
Scott: I'm more more times nine times out of ten.

142
00:08:57,554 --> 00:09:01,147
Scott: when I see an ACLU story It's like yeah and one times out of ten.

143
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,191
Scott: It's like oh what the fuck.

144
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:03,234
Rym: but here's the.

145
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:05,060
Rym: here's the deal in Ohio, Ohio.

146
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:10,833
Rym: They use touchscreens to vote but you know how voting machines are awful.

147
00:09:10,873 --> 00:09:11,736
Rym: We've talked about that.

148
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:14,926
Rym: I think you know, yep Well, Ohio is thinking.

149
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:18,720
Rym: All right, we're gonna move back to paper ballots that are perfectly verifiable.

150
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:19,524
Scott: That's good.

151
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:21,573
Scott: As long as paper ballot is properly designed and counted.

152
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:21,974
Rym: Yep.

153
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:23,260
Rym: It's one of those optical scan sheets.

154
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,822
Rym: It looks like all right, as long as it works the ACLU says hey, you can't do that Why not?

155
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:33,380
Rym: the ACLU is pointed out that with the touch screens if you make an error?

156
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,809
Rym: Voting as in you do try to vote for a candidate.

157
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:37,752
Rym: that doesn't work.

158
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:41,409
Rym: or you like you mess up the ballot in some way Like you voted for four people.

159
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:42,859
Rym: It won't let you do it.

160
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,406
Rym: I didn't let you change it and it'll.

161
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,411
Rym: it'll verify that.

162
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:51,280
Rym: what you have done is a valid voting choice Mm-hmm and with the paper ballot you can't do that.

163
00:09:51,320 --> 00:10:05,860
Rym: You've lost the rights and as far as the ACLU is concerned to get verification that your vote will be counted and as a result They're saying that you have to be able to verify the legitimacy of your vote before and during while you're casting.

164
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,988
Scott: So, how about you fill out your scan Tron sheet?

165
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:09,092
Scott: They run it through the machine.

166
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:10,076
Scott: then they give you a receipt.

167
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,943
Rym: I Have a much better Point to carbon copy.

168
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:15,444
Rym: Oh, no.

169
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:15,604
Rym: No.

170
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:15,804
Rym: No.

171
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:16,065
Rym: No.

172
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:28,991
Rym: All right, if you a human being are unable to read the instructions on a voting machine or a Voting piece of paper and you vote incorrectly.

173
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:31,460
Rym: I'm of the mind that your vote shouldn't count.

174
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,130
Scott: Yeah, it is a case to be made for that.

175
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,680
Scott: But there's also a case to be made like someone's a citizen.

176
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,106
Scott: They're sentient.

177
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:44,386
Scott: Yes, and you know, they should be able to vote even if they have Their illiterate see.

178
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,550
Rym: now they have the right to vote.

179
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,940
Rym: The thing is they have to follow the instructions.

180
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:53,900
Scott: Yeah, but what if a literate person goes to vote in the kind of voting machine we use with the clickers and the lever?

181
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,205
Rym: They probably shouldn't be voting.

182
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:57,510
Rym: That's what I'll say.

183
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,060
Scott: Oh, but they they have the right to vote.

184
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:01,268
Scott: So what what do you do for that?

185
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:02,879
Scott: They can't use the machine, you know.

186
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,699
Scott: What should they be able to just tell someone who they want to vote for and then that person should do the workings or no?

187
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,486
Rym: Because your vote has to be confidential.

188
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:12,379
Scott: Well, you know, there's got to be some Sun to do.

189
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:17,380
Scott: We already determined that having a literacy test for voting was unconstitutional.

190
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:17,843
Rym: What?

191
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,940
Rym: I kind of disagree with that, but I agree with how it was done.

192
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,395
Scott: Yes, because originally they had a literacy test for voting to keep black people from voting.

193
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:26,800
Scott: That was the original intention.

194
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,559
Rym: But and that was perhaps so the fact that the courts overturned that and said no literacy test for voting was a great thing.

195
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:32,740
Rym: back.

196
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,406
Rym: Then yeah, I think we're past that.

197
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:35,730
Rym: Oh, here's the deal.

198
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,035
Rym: I am of the mind.

199
00:11:37,055 --> 00:11:38,420
Scott: I don't think we're past that.

200
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:44,260
Scott: I think that you know in many places people would use that literacy if we had a legitimate literacy test.

201
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,480
Scott: I think in a lot of places be misused for discrimination against various groups.

202
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,380
Rym: And well, that's why instead of having a test you just their instructions for voting.

203
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,460
Rym: And if you need assistance you can ask for assistance.

204
00:11:54,881 --> 00:12:04,659
Rym: but people have the right to vote and the government will provide you a means to vote if you are unable to or choose not To take advantage of the thing they have given you then you can't.

205
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:09,186
Scott: well I guess you can go up to the person right with a sheet and say You know if I want to vote.

206
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:13,040
Scott: if they'll say if you want to vote for a person a check in this box.

207
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,087
Scott: If you want to vote for person B check in this.

208
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:16,673
Rym: but here this isn't even like.

209
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:18,560
Scott: I could have someone tell you the instructions.

210
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:21,309
Scott: You know the election worker tell you exactly what to do.

211
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:21,891
Rym: plus.

212
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:22,573
Rym: I mean look at this.

213
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:23,155
Rym: it alright.

214
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,680
Rym: the the argument isn't even.

215
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,061
Rym: It's like.

216
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:25,643
Rym: alright.

217
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:30,680
Rym: someone say they're literate and they're just dumb and they just fill out the ballot completely wrong.

218
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:32,776
Rym: Alright, what should we do with that?

219
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,488
Rym: Uh shouldn't count.

220
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:38,590
Rym: I Want how much verification do we have to do?

221
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:40,660
Rym: what if someone goes to the electronic voting booth?

222
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,658
Rym: I just mash his buttons until they break it and then well, but I mean here what if a?

223
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:47,385
Scott: What if I go in to vote?

224
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:51,100
Scott: I'm not gonna you know stupidly fill it out wrong, but I have no confirmation.

225
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:51,723
Scott: So what it?

226
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:56,897
Scott: you know I I vote and I vote for person a you don't get confirmation anyway And then it ends up getting.

227
00:12:56,978 --> 00:13:04,994
Scott: oh I can see the little red check next to the name on the thing and you can see the little check on the piece of Paper, but what if it actually ends up getting counted for person B?

228
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,019
Scott: Cuz it's something I have.

229
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:11,859
Rym: no This is only covering mistakes that you make not mistakes that the ballot system makes.

230
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:13,951
Rym: System can screw up in any case.

231
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,360
Rym: This is very specifically.

232
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:23,620
Rym: They're saying that you have the right to Have your ballot corrected by someone or have an ability to have the ballot corrected before you send it off.

233
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:33,200
Rym: now It doesn't matter the courts The ACO is gonna get creamed because as was pointed out by the Ohio Board of Elections Absentee ballots have the same problem, and they're not unconstitutional.

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,179
Scott: Dynafire yeah, yeah, I don't think they're gonna win win that there.

235
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,331
Scott: But there there are issues here that need to be dealt with.

236
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:47,560
Scott: I really think we just need some sort of Making a voting machine is so stupidly easy if they just let an intelligent person do it.

237
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:54,820
Scott: And we should really have some sort of state worldwide standard voting machine that could be configured for any sort of election.

238
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:59,075
Scott: That would be perfect and simple and it would work and that could be done trivially.

239
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:00,801
Rym: and the fact that it hasn't been really bothers Me.

240
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,795
Scott: but so we should start a company that does that it just.

241
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:12,608
Scott: there's a big difficulty in Nonprofit company that's worldwide and we administer elections in any country with our Guaranteed voting machines guaranteed everything.

242
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:15,620
Rym: I wouldn't be my I wouldn't mind at all and all software be open source.

243
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:30,560
Rym: Maybe the only test to vote was there's a there's a little maze and you have to make it through the maze and somewhere in The maze is the voting machine That we'd have mice voting that we don't want that it's better than the cut anyway, yeah, okay, wait.

244
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,405
Scott: So I like how you're paying all attention to selection and then you just insult all the people voting and then you claim that All the people voting.

245
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:51,258
Rym: I insulted the people who don't understand how to vote and and do it wrong And then get mad when their ballot doesn't anyway anyway, so Audible calm right if you don't know audible calm is a website where you can.

246
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:51,740
Scott: it's also.

247
00:14:51,921 --> 00:15:02,980
Scott: It's a service and if you want audio books in digital format to listen to on your iPod or other device or your computer They sell them to you, and they give you one free book if you sign up.

248
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:03,726
Scott: You know whatever.

249
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,319
Scott: you get one free book before you sign up.

250
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,594
Scott: So it's not too bad, and there are a lot of really long books.

251
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:09,719
Scott: You can get your free books worth.

252
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:15,767
Scott: They have DRM though, which is part of the reason I never you know considered signing up for them.

253
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:19,680
Scott: because you know if I'm paying for an audiobook right you know some reasonable price.

254
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:22,737
Scott: I didn't actually know what the pricing was until today, but I'll get to that.

255
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:28,773
Scott: You know if I'm paying for an audiobook I'd like to you know maybe give Rym that audiobook or give it to.

256
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,315
Scott: you know some.

257
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:33,993
Scott: I mean if I buy a book at The bookstore you know from Amazon or whatever I can give it to Rym to read.

258
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:39,417
Scott: you know why should we you know if there's An audiobook why should we be paying for it two or three times just for multiple people?

259
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:40,140
Scott: so that DRM?

260
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:41,625
Scott: Made me consider.

261
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,998
Scott: You know never actually consider audible seriously.

262
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:44,159
Scott: now.

263
00:15:44,963 --> 00:15:58,267
Scott: Today Amazon announced they're buying audible, which makes a lot of sense because Amazon's really busting out with their mp3 store That's selling non DRM music that from like almost every major label pretty much out there I might and depending on their prices.

264
00:15:58,327 --> 00:16:13,680
Scott: I might even consider buying some of that action, but You know what happened today is Amazon bought audible and since Amazon's kicking out the DRM I said hey Maybe audible will lose the DRM and then I can go and sign up for audible and get mad audiobooks to supplement my podcast.

265
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:15,935
Scott: right so I go to audible.com.

266
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:26,691
Scott: right and For the first time ever I actually looked at Audibles pricing scheme and After I look at it.

267
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:37,833
Scott: I say to myself Even if this didn't have DRM who and they're you know outside of it a ludicrously rich person Who in their right fucking mind would ever sign up for audible?

268
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:40,120
Scott: all right check out the four different plans?

269
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:41,128
Scott: You can have you ready.

270
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:51,871
Scott: plan number one For seven dollars and fifty cents a month for a few months for the first three months But after the first three months is fifteen dollars a month well 1495 right.

271
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:57,671
Scott: you get one Audiobook a month one book.

272
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:58,715
Rym: It's not that bad.

273
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,140
Rym: It takes a while to listen to an audiobook.

274
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,119
Rym: You know that they are yeah, but I mean Liz.

275
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:07,525
Scott: 750 for the first three books and then $15 for every other book.

276
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,732
Scott: $15 for a book for $15.

277
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:12,359
Scott: I can get like three or four paperback books.

278
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,248
Rym: I think you're forgetting.

279
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:18,680
Rym: There's as far as I'm concerned There is only one use for audiobooks, and that is really well.

280
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,777
Rym: I guess the subway and all that sort of thing could cover.

281
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:28,903
Scott: basically It's no I see more people who I see about equal numbers of people with paper books and headphones in the subway And I don't think the headphone.

282
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:36,450
Rym: people are all listening to audiobooks, but basically if I'm driving somewhere I used to drive to work I used to drive about an hour to work every time.

283
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:38,460
Rym: I you know commuted an hour there an hour back.

284
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:40,347
Rym: So I can't read while I'm driving.

285
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:42,194
Rym: well, I shouldn't read while I'm driving.

286
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:42,937
Rym: at least I can.

287
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:43,740
Rym: not a good idea.

288
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:48,857
Rym: So uh audiobooks are totally worth that because how else am I gonna read books?

289
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:49,840
Scott: Okay, okay?

290
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:52,767
Scott: How much is an audiobook on CD?

291
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:54,653
Rym: a similar amount of money?

292
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,676
Scott: I don't know.

293
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:57,060
Scott: yeah, I've seen him pretty cheap.

294
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:59,873
Rym: Yeah, if you get look get him like on sale way after the fact discount.

295
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,018
Rym: even then you don't find him like that.

296
00:18:01,118 --> 00:18:01,702
Scott: usually you Know.

297
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:06,720
Scott: plus if I'm going on a trip There's enough like podcast fiction that I can get for free.

298
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,160
Scott: I could just load up on like 10 escape pods for nothing.

299
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:17,547
Scott: But if you were if you were commuting an hour each way every day You know when I was commuting an hour each way every day podcast It's pretty much filled up the ride both ways.

300
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:20,196
Rym: see mine would but I hate almost all podcasts.

301
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:32,940
Scott: Yeah, all right, but anyway You can also pay 150 a year for 12 $23 a month for two a month and $230 a year for two audiobooks a month.

302
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:38,199
Scott: If I'm paying $230 a year I expect unlimited audiobooks.

303
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:41,939
Scott: pretty much You should be able to give me as many, but it doesn't cost them any more money to give me more books.

304
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:44,047
Scott: They're all digital files.

305
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:58,120
Scott: Yeah, whatever trivial amount of bandwidth Audible you know as even if you really like audiobooks I consider this to be a horrendous ripoff in terms of how much audiobooks cost outside of audible.

306
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,371
Scott: It doesn't matter at this price.

307
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:01,959
Scott: They're not worth it for any audiobook.

308
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:04,386
Scott: Screw audible.

309
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,332
Scott: I'm not signing up.

310
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:10,736
Scott: unless the price goes way down I'd be willing to pay like two dollars for a single audiobook.

311
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:11,458
Rym: see I do.

312
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:23,672
Rym: I Understand why they have the DRM though just because as we were saying all right if audible didn't have DRM And I got it I'd probably lend every audiobook I ever got to all my friends as I do with DVDs currently.

313
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:25,680
Scott: yeah, so what's the problem with that?

314
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,724
Scott: I bought it.

315
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:28,740
Rym: well see that's the problem with DRM.

316
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,080
Rym: But yeah as then I'm saying I understand why they do it because then they probably wouldn't be profitable otherwise.

317
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:38,940
Scott: And I don't think I don't see how you cannot profit with prices like this and a seemingly large customer base.

318
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,756
Scott: It seems like a lot of people do sign up for this.

319
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:43,866
Scott: so oh Well yeah audible.com.

320
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:45,412
Scott: out of Scott's consideration.

321
00:19:45,513 --> 00:19:46,536
Rym: I don't think the price is.

322
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:48,708
Rym: I mean I'll agree I think it's a little overpriced.

323
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:50,460
Rym: I don't think it's nearly as bad as you're making it out.

324
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,802
Scott: It's pretty bad as far as I'm concerned.

325
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:05,990
Rym: some years ago We were in Wildwood, New Jersey And we for various reasons decided to deep fry some pizza.

326
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,783
Rym: You can see the pictures of that in the forum.

327
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:11,999
Rym: it tasted like a hot pocket And that's really all that needs to be said.

328
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,857
Rym: yep, so uh We've ever since then we've always had an interest in.

329
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:23,653
Rym: I don't know maybe the word is awful perhaps horrible Dangerous food.

330
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:29,990
Scott: well, but the first sort of encounter I had with the eating strange food for sport was way back in high school.

331
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,962
Scott: I was watching like some public access TV.

332
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:33,350
Rym: Oh, that's always a good idea.

333
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:40,813
Scott: And this guy basically this is his show is he was sitting there with a telephone taking stupid calls right and He had this.

334
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:56,949
Scott: his friend at the grocery store right apparently found this soup and the package said There was a picture of a chicken on it right like a you know a silhouette of like a chicken icon Right like sort of like chicken at the VNC, and it said cock flavored soup mix.

335
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,450
Scott: So they made it and then he drank it out of a mug and he said that's good cock.

336
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:09,484
Rym: That was possibly the most anticlimactic and lame story I've ever heard.

337
00:21:09,524 --> 00:21:11,269
Scott: that was that was sort of the point of the story.

338
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:17,194
Rym: But seriously we uh It's a tradition.

339
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:18,960
Rym: I guess but not really.

340
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,943
Rym: I just I find horrible food like that hilarious and cock flavored soup mix.

341
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:30,810
Rym: I discovered An item an item that frightens me a little bit from the trekking miles.

342
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:35,366
Rym: Is a cheeseburger a cheeseburger that comes in a can?

343
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,767
Rym: now you might say oh well Is it like a patty in a can?

344
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:37,868
Scott: yeah?

345
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,408
Scott: I assumed it was a patty in a can and you just heat up the patty and then put it on some bread.

346
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:59,735
Rym: it is an entire cheeseburger with bun and cheese and sesame seeds and Britain meat Can and in the can is a fully intact already cooked cheeseburger with so it's bread cheese and meat and Condiments and pickles.

347
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:04,252
Scott: so there's ketchup and pickles and mustard and yes sesame seeds.

348
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:10,815
Rym: you boil the can in water for like 10 minutes to heat it up, and you open the can and Greeting you in.

349
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:12,529
Rym: the can is the top of a cheeseburger.

350
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:13,753
Scott: How do you get it out?

351
00:22:14,074 --> 00:22:15,438
Rym: you just turn the can upside down.

352
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:17,364
Scott: the hot boiling hot can.

353
00:22:17,384 --> 00:22:19,309
Rym: it cools down pretty quick is it?

354
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,285
Scott: boiling hot Yeah, I guess she is kinda hot.

355
00:22:22,346 --> 00:22:28,562
Scott: Radisco Give to Radisco No coffee for Radisco.

356
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,769
Rym: Radisco having good dream.

357
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:40,625
Rym: But uh This looks all levels of awful And I think the worst comes up with who can't?

358
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:41,590
Rym: someone came up with this.

359
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,640
Rym: Oh, they also someone eats it actually actually they.

360
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:45,965
Rym: they also sell powdered wine.

361
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:48,274
Rym: now the reason for all this Powdered wine.

362
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:50,644
Scott: that could be a way to get a lot of wine in a small amount of space.

363
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:52,554
Scott: or you have a lot of More powder.

364
00:22:52,574 --> 00:22:54,869
Scott: you like double the powder per water to get more drunk.

365
00:22:55,751 --> 00:23:07,210
Rym: that would that's port basically, but anyway the the reason this looks so awful is partly because All the grease in the burger and all this just kind of like oozes down into the bottom half of the bun.

366
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,522
Scott: Just throw out the bun part and eat.

367
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:10,850
Scott: put the patty on a new bread.

368
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:14,444
Rym: But the reason this thing exists is it actually kind of a good idea.

369
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:16,070
Rym: It's something you bring camping.

370
00:23:16,171 --> 00:23:17,380
Rym: It's like a camping food.

371
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:18,770
Scott: if I'm camping.

372
00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:22,970
Scott: I'll just bring some wieners and put them on sticks and stick them in a fire depends.

373
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,383
Rym: I mean if you're hiking you don't you're not gonna have refrigeration or anything.

374
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:30,250
Rym: you got to bring preserved food And this is something that's really convenient and quick.

375
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:35,367
Rym: And I will admit and the guy said it didn't make him sick And it wasn't the worst thing in the world he'd eaten.

376
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:37,761
Scott: so It can't be worse than McDonald's.

377
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:46,128
Rym: so if I was in the middle of nowhere And I'd been like when I went hiking in the Adirondacks if I had had one of these I probably eaten it raw right then and there.

378
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:50,875
Rym: And if I would have been the best thing I'd ever eaten Trail mix man.

379
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:51,940
Scott: There's a reason they invented.

380
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:52,523
Rym: Yeah, you know what.

381
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:55,699
Rym: I'd already eaten all my trail mix And I'd eaten all the power bars.

382
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,669
Rym: I brought and I drunk all my water.

383
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:00,598
Rym: Well, I still had like eight miles to go.

384
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:03,930
Scott: you're supposed to bring it up provisions for your entire distance.

385
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,718
Scott: You're supposed to figure that out beforehand.

386
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,326
Scott: Oh, yeah, bring it up provisions.

387
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,150
Scott: That's your own fault.

388
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:09,819
Rym: I didn't bring it up provisions by far.

389
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:25,275
Scott: Yeah, all right, but The pictures on this thing of the day are kind of epic right so way back Back in the day right there was a. it was like some guy made like the first or one of the first Google Maps mashups before.

390
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:26,419
Scott: there was like a Google API.

391
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:29,830
Scott: even it was and what it did is it showed like the crime in Chicago.

392
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:31,727
Scott: I think the website's still up somewhere right?

393
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:37,809
Rym: Oh, yeah Well, I think I remember that being cool cuz you look and there were some street corners like wow what's going on there right?

394
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:46,834
Scott: Well that guy has a new site and the site It's could be a lot better of a website mostly because it doesn't have Google any sort of map Integration.

395
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:49,269
Scott: and if it had some app integration be the best site ever.

396
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:58,269
Scott: But regardless of its lack of map integration This information available on this site is so awesome and so useful that is totally worth it.

397
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,039
Scott: now The website is called every block.

398
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,206
Scott: calm right and right now.

399
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:06,498
Scott: He's covering Chicago New York and San Francisco.

400
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:06,719
Scott: right.

401
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:07,903
Rym: is it what's on every block.

402
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:08,786
Scott: It's not.

403
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:09,770
Scott: it's not exactly.

404
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,976
Scott: It's not everything of what's on every block right.

405
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,266
Scott: it is specific information of what's on every block.

406
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:24,150
Rym: pick up pick a block all right 59th Street and 7th Avenue the Northwest.

407
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,319
Scott: That's the first problem with this website.

408
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,022
Scott: right is right.

409
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:28,725
Scott: I can go to 59th Street.

410
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:41,325
Scott: Okay, I click on 59th Street, and now it wants to know like the numbers so we can do like you know 1 through 99 West odd a hundred through 198 West.

411
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:46,250
Rym: I don't think I've known the address of a place in New York City ever.

412
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:47,174
Scott: I know that's.

413
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:50,669
Scott: the one problem with this website is if it had a map it would be super useful.

414
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:56,730
Scott: now Once you actually find the address you're looking for right it gives you a shit ton of useful information.

415
00:25:56,791 --> 00:26:00,789
Scott: Here's the useful information you get ready recent building permits.

416
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:03,389
Scott: recent building violations issued.

417
00:26:04,032 --> 00:26:06,582
Scott: Recent violent building violations resolved.

418
00:26:06,783 --> 00:26:08,129
Scott: not too exciting yet, right?

419
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:15,110
Scott: Business reviews crime reports graffiti cleaned graffiti pending cleanup.

420
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,316
Scott: landmark building permits.

421
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:28,210
Scott: liquor licenses lost and found postings Misconnections news articles photos and the most interesting of all the thing that makes this website thing of the day worthy.

422
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,469
Scott: restaurant inspection results that are recent.

423
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:38,430
Scott: Huh, let's see the cocoa gourmet restaurant was inspected and got 15 violation points and two violations cited.

424
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:39,556
Rym: That's not that bad.

425
00:26:39,637 --> 00:26:39,777
Scott: No.

426
00:26:39,818 --> 00:26:43,316
Rym: It's not that bad, but I just remember the one day I was in the city with Emily.

427
00:26:43,356 --> 00:26:46,270
Rym: I think and we're we saw a call Steve Austin cream room.

428
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,541
Rym: We're like oh, man You know get some ice cream after we go do this.

429
00:26:49,602 --> 00:26:54,585
Rym: other thing we came back And it was closed with a health violation warning on the door.

430
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:58,965
Scott: Yeah Thing is you can't search for like the name of a business.

431
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:02,593
Scott: you got to go to the street And the streets are arranged in the way I just described.

432
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:07,330
Scott: so you really have to know the the address of where you're at or like the zip code or something.

433
00:27:08,034 --> 00:27:10,950
Rym: Set it up where I could use my GPS Google Maps.

434
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:16,907
Rym: I got going on my blackberry now And it would just give me the information about the block right next to me or the two blocks right next to you.

435
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:27,723
Scott: another interesting thing about this website right is If you go to like the type like if I go to the restaurant inspections page for the whole city There's like this little graph going on.

436
00:27:27,783 --> 00:27:31,401
Scott: you can see the graph goes up And it goes down on the weekends when no one's inspecting.

437
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:36,525
Scott: right, but let's see so far they have 1,830 restaurant inspections in the last 30 days.

438
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:37,490
Scott: someone's doing their job.

439
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:39,598
Scott: Let's see by neighborhood.

440
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:47,349
Scott: most of the most of the inspections are in Midtown Most of them are in Manhattan then Brooklyn and then Queens and the Bronx are way down there.

441
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:49,479
Scott: Oh, we got it's by zip code.

442
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,570
Scott: How many there are okay by violation?

443
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:59,210
Scott: 7,873 violations of non-food contact surface improperly constructed.

444
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:03,629
Scott: Five thousand eight hundred and thirty five violations of not vermin proof.

445
00:28:04,534 --> 00:28:07,229
Scott: four thousand seven hundred and sixty six violations of mice.

446
00:28:07,993 --> 00:28:11,750
Scott: Three thousand nine hundred and sixty flying insects and a partridge.

447
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:15,198
Scott: Three thousand three eighty six cold gun.

448
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,181
Rym: I apologize for that.

449
00:28:16,221 --> 00:28:20,033
Rym: that was like one of those radio guy jokes I or like a letter.

450
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,537
Rym: I'm sorry that was dumb.

451
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:26,430
Scott: Yeah about three thousand cold food held above 41 degrees Fahrenheit.

452
00:28:26,692 --> 00:28:27,779
Rym: That's the danger zone.

453
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,855
Scott: yeah food not protected from contamination.

454
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,401
Scott: signs not posted.

455
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:33,505
Scott: improper plumbing.

456
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:34,790
Scott: hot food not held.

457
00:28:37,372 --> 00:28:39,359
Rym: We get the idea improper plumbing.

458
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,470
Rym: we get the idea expired milk rats.

459
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:43,979
Rym: We had some expired milk.

460
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:45,709
Scott: use of vendor lacking a permit.

461
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,493
Scott: improper sewage disposal.

462
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:49,636
Rym: so speaking of improper sewage disposal.

463
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:50,858
Scott: proper cooking of poultry.

464
00:28:51,078 --> 00:28:56,220
Rym: Scott and I and And pretty much the rest of the crew here in Beacon are thinking about buying a house.

465
00:28:56,961 --> 00:29:01,036
Scott: Yeah, well, we'll see exactly how it's gonna work out, but we've been renting this place.

466
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:01,940
Scott: It's a good place.

467
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:06,565
Scott: it's a good deal, but we have money and Were there.

468
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:08,720
Scott: a few things where we're not fully satisfied.

469
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,398
Scott: I don't think they can be rectified without moving to a real house that we own now.

470
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:16,738
Rym: It would be fun to do like fantasy geek house like.

471
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:24,360
Rym: well We would have the Tezuka reading room in the the land gaming room in the atrium and the planet Arion.

472
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:28,086
Rym: But now the gymnasium The forum.

473
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:30,540
Rym: we need a forum the the Olympic pool.

474
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:41,390
Rym: But now we're gonna talk about is something much more professional Marco Polo court bowling alley bowling at Malta Largest arcade roller coaster.

475
00:29:41,732 --> 00:29:43,360
Rym: Oh don't forget the cart track.

476
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:50,244
Rym: I think the most important thing is the formula one track is the ice hockey arena that doubles as an ice Paintball arena.

477
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:52,312
Scott: Zamboni to Zambonis.

478
00:29:52,553 --> 00:29:54,460
Rym: Oh, we'd have a Zamboni racetrack anyway.

479
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:58,586
Scott: But now now Well, hey, I just thought of something.

480
00:29:58,606 --> 00:30:02,420
Scott: You know, there's speed skating where you see it in the circle real fast Zamboni racing.

481
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:03,365
Scott: No, no, no, no.

482
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:03,768
Scott: Okay.

483
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:05,840
Scott: Why don't they have Grand Prix speed skating?

484
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,450
Scott: We have to turn left and right on like a Grand Prix track.

485
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:09,897
Rym: That'd be really cool.

486
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:13,410
Scott: I know right Why the fuck is not anyone made that's a legitimate sport.

487
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,140
Rym: That was a really interesting grammatical structure.

488
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,207
Scott: You just used why it's a legitimate sport.

489
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:19,150
Scott: No, no.

490
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,174
Rym: No, why is that not?

491
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:21,378
Scott: Why is it not?

492
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:21,980
Rym: I like that.

493
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,482
Rym: That was good.

494
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:23,425
Scott: All right.

495
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:25,111
Rym: Anyway, I don't know why that's not.

496
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:28,625
Rym: it should be because I like those speed skates a lot with the Clacking going on in the back.

497
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:31,900
Scott: Yeah, and they go whoosh whoosh whoosh and they're all wearing like nothing.

498
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:34,862
Scott: Okay Uh-huh.

499
00:30:35,385 --> 00:30:36,430
Rym: That's what you focus on.

500
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:36,691
Rym: Yeah.

501
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:47,454
Rym: Anyway, so Be a little more realistic, but I guess I just want to talk about because it seems like in general geeks Think about their lives a lot.

502
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:54,187
Rym: geeks and nerds one thing we have in common is that We look at things in our lives and we think like like, you know The classic joke they don't go like.

503
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:56,200
Rym: a nerd is a system for everything like that.

504
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,640
Rym: Nerd is a system for eating pancakes and stuff like that.

505
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,575
Rym: But it's more than you think about things in your life and you think how can I make these things better?

506
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:03,700
Rym: heck things we change.

507
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:16,127
Scott: Yes, other people seem to you know, everyone is subject to doing most things by habit or by you know automatic miss, you know and we could do all show about that whole stuff, but you know it seems like geeks and nerds tend to do.

508
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:26,217
Scott: let things with a little bit more or you know of Thinking put into them and and then they build a habit as opposed to just having a habit now arbitrarily more often

509
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:30,473
Rym: and you know We're the more we look at houseplants and think about buying a house the more I realize

510
00:31:30,493 --> 00:31:30,834
Scott: plants

511
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:31,718
Rym: plans

512
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:32,260
Scott: burns.

513
00:31:32,581 --> 00:31:35,395
Rym: I want some houseplants to the fern big old fern.

514
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:48,320
Rym: Okay, but The more I think about it the more I realize very obvious changes that could I could make to a house I lived in to make it so much nicer to live in that it would just be like you would be worth almost any cost.

515
00:31:48,360 --> 00:32:04,951
Scott: Well right now there are really only three things I need, you know above and beyond what we already have in this house to be sort of satisfied and not really desiring anymore with a. You know, it's like there are three things I super want and everything else is sort of like it would be nice.

516
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:08,930
Scott: the three things I super want that I don't have Are a dishwasher.

517
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:13,911
Scott: Yep a dryer yeah, and either a garage or basement one or the other.

518
00:32:13,992 --> 00:32:15,497
Rym: I prefer a basement because I don't.

519
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:19,220
Rym: I Really got spoiled as a kid because I've always had a garage.

520
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:25,768
Rym: I always kept my car in the garage never had a garage never had to deal with like snow and ice on my car Anything stupid like that.

521
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:27,700
Rym: I was always parked indoors never mattered.

522
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:39,039
Rym: Then I got to college and I learned for the first time that oh in Rochester It'll snow point five inches and then turn into ice every single day from November until May.

523
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:41,567
Rym: Yep And I got used to that.

524
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,296
Rym: but I don't live in Rochester anymore.

525
00:32:43,698 --> 00:32:47,193
Rym: I don't care I don't even use my car that much so I don't need the garage.

526
00:32:47,273 --> 00:32:48,800
Rym: I know a shed would be fine.

527
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:57,740
Scott: Yeah, I mostly need a place to store all this kind of shit that you know Normally be stored in garage or base because right now we're storing it like under the stairs.

528
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,034
Scott: It's not so good like the air conditioners.

529
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:00,859
Rym: We'll get to that.

530
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,068
Scott: We're like, yeah, like air conditioners in the winter.

531
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:03,710
Scott: Where do you put them?

532
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:06,179
Scott: like the bikes a box full of tools?

533
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,300
Rym: Yeah, GeekNights bin full of stuff that we only use at conventions and don't need any other time ever.

534
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,320
Scott: Yeah, this all the stuff that normal people put in garages and basements.

535
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:18,627
Scott: We have nowhere to put it and you know We have a washing machine and no dryer.

536
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:23,245
Scott: a dryer would save me from having to go to the laundromat to dry my clothes after I watched them in the house.

537
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:26,240
Scott: So that would be a huge, you know improvement in my life.

538
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,767
Scott: I'd save all that time and effort.

539
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:34,354
Scott: I'd be able to do laundry more often have less clothes Etc also having a better more efficient washer would count.

540
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:35,960
Scott: Yeah something I was better at washing.

541
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,840
Scott: Also, my clothes be cleaner smell nicer use less water, I guess and a dishwasher.

542
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:45,030
Scott: I spent a lot of time cleaning dishes and running out of dishes.

543
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:50,660
Scott: a dishwasher would make really improve our lives I think more than any other device in the known universe.

544
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:58,489
Rym: yep, now the basement counts for a lot too because one there are two things two things that are very important to me in my Life that I don't get to do as much as I would like.

545
00:33:58,951 --> 00:34:01,300
Rym: one is dance dance revolution and the other is air hockey.

546
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,780
Rym: Now we can't have an air hockey table in this house because there's no room for her.

547
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,380
Rym: We could put it in the middle of the living room and it would fit.

548
00:34:08,722 --> 00:34:11,899
Rym: In fact, if we put it over by the back door, it wouldn't even really be in the way.

549
00:34:12,522 --> 00:34:16,000
Scott: It would probably fall through the floor into the basement because it's so heavy.

550
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,100
Rym: The problem is the same problem we have with DDR the floor would collapse.

551
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,620
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure in a better house or I mean our house isn't bad.

552
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,560
Scott: But you know in a high a super high quality house with awesome floors at the floor could support an air hockey table.

553
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,772
Scott: But I mean, you don't put a pool tape.

554
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:34,360
Scott: everyone puts pool table in their basement.

555
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:40,724
Scott: You can't have a giant stone putting weight on a wooden floor, you know, you no matter how sturdy the floor is It just you don't do that.

556
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:44,458
Rym: It's goes the general the front row crew gathers at our house.

557
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:46,520
Rym: pretty much This is where everyone always gathers.

558
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,599
Rym: We have the biggest house and we're kind of central to everyone like beacon to the center of the front row crew right now.

559
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,650
Rym: Yeah, except for those outliers out in tejas, whatever Tejas tejas.

560
00:34:56,034 --> 00:35:03,540
Rym: Yeah, but Whenever everyone comes over we basically have one big living room and a kitchen and that's it downstairs.

561
00:35:04,081 --> 00:35:11,300
Rym: So as a result, we kind of have this blob of people and if we had another room that we could kind of entertain it.

562
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,048
Rym: I'm thinking a finished basement because I've always had finished basements.

563
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:16,274
Rym: finished basements like the best thing ever.

564
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:26,599
Rym: you have a wet bar down there You have the pool table in the air hockey table and then a big open space with some like cheapo couches and a TV And you can just chill and play games down there.

565
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:35,299
Scott: Yep Dungeons and dragons in the basement was a tradition in my life up until I went to college and then run to dragons no longer In the basement, we sort of made it not the same.

566
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,195
Rym: Yeah, I mean even now it really sucks to set up to play.

567
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:42,580
Rym: well burning wheel now But you know role-playing because we got to get like all these different tables.

568
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,820
Scott: Yeah, I ordered a burning empires and burning sand.

569
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,245
Scott: So now I go.

570
00:35:47,285 --> 00:35:53,206
Scott: you ordered dune and I'm soon going to be the proud owner of every Loot crane game so far.

571
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:57,560
Rym: Yeah, if you haven't listened to GeekNights much just there's a thing called burning wheel.

572
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,444
Rym: Just go buy the books.

573
00:35:58,505 --> 00:35:59,891
Rym: Don't even think about what it is.

574
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:00,394
Rym: Just buy them.

575
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,580
Rym: All right, you'll find out.

576
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:03,097
Rym: Yeah soon enough read them.

577
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:06,290
Rym: But yeah a finished basement would make.

578
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:08,980
Rym: because you know we was complain about the Visigoths wrecking our house.

579
00:36:09,623 --> 00:36:17,039
Rym: The main reason they wreck our house is because there's like 15 people and There's nowhere for them to put their stuff and they're all in the same room.

580
00:36:17,662 --> 00:36:21,940
Scott: Yeah, they're all crowded in and if you had one if you had a basement we can stuff them all in the basement.

581
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,282
Scott: Who cares?

582
00:36:22,322 --> 00:36:23,328
Scott: the basement gets messed up.

583
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:24,313
Scott: That's what basements for.

584
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:25,178
Rym: Yeah, and there were.

585
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:28,009
Scott: oh, no Someone spilled something on the concrete floor.

586
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:29,333
Scott: Whatever will we do?

587
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:32,687
Scott: I think we'd tile it if we're gonna finish it I know but you see that you see my point.

588
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:33,390
Rym: Yeah.

589
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,340
Rym: Yeah, maybe a big throw rug or something.

590
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:44,949
Rym: Yeah, but just having it seemed because I've noticed that the primary cause of messes in my life is simply that it's like if I Had more space to put things away in an organized and

591
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:53,138
Scott: the same amount of the same amount of mess would look less messy Because it would be spread out Whole bunch of cups piled up on top of each other.

592
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,759
Scott: There'd be a cup here and a cup a few feet away and a cup a few feet away.

593
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:59,493
Rym: Well, the cups would be solved by a dishwasher.

594
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:02,900
Scott: I know I know I know But uh, yeah basement.

595
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,420
Rym: But then we started thinking about all the things that you could do if you owned your own house.

596
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:10,980
Rym: That would make your life great, especially for a geek and I think the biggest one.

597
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:13,287
Rym: I was inspired upon reading up.

598
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:21,740
Rym: Well Horatio and all that gave it to me, but I was really inspired when reading up the terror Because I realized you want a boat in ships, right?

599
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,943
Rym: Those old ships.

600
00:37:23,345 --> 00:37:30,119
Rym: the tables were mounted in the ceiling on ropes and you lowered them When you needed them and you put them back in the ceiling when you weren't using them.

601
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:35,174
Rym: So in the basement of our house, what if we just have some gigantic table in the ceiling?

602
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:37,060
Scott: It's not it's not a bad idea.

603
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:46,856
Scott: I've seen guys who have model railroads or you know slot car racing sets and they have you know A system that lowers the table from the ceiling and that you have a remote control.

604
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:49,266
Rym: you hit a button table In fact, the coolest.

605
00:37:49,326 --> 00:37:49,969
Rym: it's pretty slick.

606
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:52,440
Scott: I mean you could have it right above the air hockey table, too.

607
00:37:52,520 --> 00:38:01,940
Scott: So like you're playing air hockey then you step back you lower down this piece of wood from the ceiling You know on top of the air hockey table and then everyone pulls chairs up around it and poop table.

608
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:03,759
Scott: You didn't lose any space in your house.

609
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:15,285
Scott: so you can pay for less square footage of house yet have utility of basically a whole extra room because one room turns into another room sort of Like transformer.

610
00:38:15,466 --> 00:38:21,858
Scott: so no sort of like a tavern turning into a casino Swinging his pet shop in.

611
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,132
Rym: But I also the coolest one ever saw was a model railroad and it inspired.

612
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:27,313
Rym: this.

613
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:34,560
Rym: also inspired me was that the guy would stand In the middle and hit a button and the sections would all come down around him to where he was now surrounded by table.

614
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:36,347
Scott: I don't think that's so useful for us.

615
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:36,849
Rym: Yes, it is.

616
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,499
Rym: The dungeon master is sitting in the middle.

617
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:48,076
Scott: You could it's a little corny, but I guess it's possible But it doesn't work if you want to do it on top of the air hockey table unless they're gonna sit on the air hockey table.

618
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,409
Rym: Yeah Well, if you put in the middle of the room the way they do it is.

619
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:58,031
Rym: he actually had a section that filled in the center where he could be and He had if he had different buttons different sections came down.

620
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:00,160
Scott: So it's getting a little too complicated.

621
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,552
Scott: No idea and principle is good, but I also looked into the systems and people.

622
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:05,960
Rym: there's already pre-made systems that do this with stepper motors.

623
00:39:06,181 --> 00:39:06,462
Scott: Oh, yeah.

624
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:13,257
Scott: Yeah, you just buy one and you know mounted on the ceiling which is you know I guess you screws into the concrete there and then you're good to go.

625
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:21,368
Rym: Yeah Now I'm also think this isn't really a geeky thing, but I definitely I want a foyer or a Foyer as it may be.

626
00:39:21,388 --> 00:39:23,578
Scott: I don't really need the foyer so much.

627
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:24,040
Rym: Yes you do.

628
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,920
Rym: You leave your shoes all over the house.

629
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,770
Scott: You're the only one who gives a shit about where the shoes are.

630
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,757
Scott: your shoes you take them off and you put.

631
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:32,326
Scott: wherever you take Them off is where they are.

632
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:34,257
Rym: No you put them in a closet or something.

633
00:39:34,277 --> 00:39:34,740
Rym: get them out of the way.

634
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,967
Scott: Don't just leave them when I need them again.

635
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:37,294
Scott: I got to go in the stupid closet.

636
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:38,300
Scott: It's right there.

637
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:40,484
Rym: I'm sorry.

638
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,914
Rym: You're some sort of ostracothic barbarian.

639
00:39:42,934 --> 00:39:45,522
Scott: I do not care about the foyer Plus.

640
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,125
Rym: there is Scott.

641
00:39:46,145 --> 00:39:48,836
Rym: you I think you for underestimate the power of the foyer.

642
00:39:49,157 --> 00:39:51,264
Rym: Yeah Forget your shoes.

643
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:55,617
Rym: when the visigoths come there's always a pile of crap in the hallway because they all do.

644
00:39:55,637 --> 00:39:57,744
Rym: they all bring coats and Things and bags and crap.

645
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:02,791
Rym: you leave all those in the fire all the shoes all the crap stays there all the dirt that stays in there.

646
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:08,919
Rym: also When it's woman out and and and it's cold You know it's like an airlock.

647
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:14,180
Rym: You open the front door people take care of all the coats and crap and that door gets closed.

648
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:18,260
Rym: And then they open the door to the house, and there is never that moment of shut the door Pete.

649
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,103
Rym: Oh my god.

650
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:20,529
Rym: Shut the door god damn it Pete.

651
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:21,513
Rym: Why are still open?

652
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:22,076
Scott: that is that.

653
00:40:22,116 --> 00:40:25,648
Scott: that is a good point You know to make that the advantage of the foyer.

654
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:29,460
Scott: there are many advantages there are but that's such a small thing.

655
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,183
Scott: It's not.

656
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:32,815
Scott: it's a huge thing if you keep you think that that's huge.

657
00:40:32,835 --> 00:40:34,000
Scott: I mean it's huge.

658
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:35,786
Scott: Washing dishes is huge.

659
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:39,500
Scott: It's huge if you're not having a cool breeze once in a while is not huge.

660
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,976
Rym: It's huge if you're not some sort of shoe leaving barbarian.

661
00:40:42,996 --> 00:40:43,016
Rym: a

662
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:48,332
Scott: foyer I'm not gonna say you know I would purposefully avoid getting one But I could live without

663
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:58,020
Rym: let me put it this way every other than the house the two out the world of one house the earliest house ever lived in in Detroit and The house I lived in momentarily in New Baltimore.

664
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:05,971
Rym: Every house ever lived in had a foyer and once I moved to a place where I no longer had a foyer It really I noticed not having a foyer.

665
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:07,940
Rym: I didn't think I'd notice not having a foyer.

666
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,811
Scott: It doesn't bother me that I can live without it.

667
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:10,515
Scott: It would be.

668
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:11,400
Scott: it would have advantage.

669
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:18,260
Scott: Semi foyer and I didn't have two doors, but in my house and connect you know my parents house is a foyer.

670
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:19,428
Scott: It doesn't have a second door.

671
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:21,080
Rym: ah see the second door.

672
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,955
Scott: It's one door and then a closet and then a portal, but no door on it.

673
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:26,100
Rym: You know we just have portals.

674
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:29,936
Rym: Yeah, but it was actually was cool that the house.

675
00:41:29,976 --> 00:41:30,800
Rym: I lived in in Detroit.

676
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:37,280
Rym: It was like the Detroit's equivalent of suburban like brownstones, but it was just like old brick house like two-story.

677
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,846
Rym: But it was one of those old fancy houses meaning.

678
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:45,059
Rym: It's fancy, but the fanciness is mitigated by the fact that it's ancient and drafty.

679
00:41:46,042 --> 00:42:00,776
Rym: But the front door was like this solid like two inch thick oak door And it was like rounded at the top and at this big like iron door like door knocker on it and this crazy old handle And once you open it you're in this big like not big.

680
00:42:00,816 --> 00:42:01,680
Rym: it was big when I was a kid.

681
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,380
Rym: It's probably not so big now that I'm an adult, but there's a little fire.

682
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:09,320
Rym: There's a coat closet, and they're like iron stuff everywhere, and then there were French doors leading to the house.

683
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,665
Rym: It was pretty cool of course.

684
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:13,797
Rym: Uh we broke those French doors so often you wouldn't even.

685
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:14,459
Scott: yeah.

686
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:15,705
Rym: Well, I was a kid.

687
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:16,630
Rym: I just hit it with a hammer.

688
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,480
Scott: see that's that's something to me.

689
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:30,480
Scott: It's even I give up the foyer, but there's something that I really would want and that is and it's actually really expensive But high quality doors and windows are so important because a high quality windows, right?

690
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:38,652
Scott: You may if you never lived somewhere with shitty old windows like pizza old apartment Or if you've only ever had shitty old windows and you haven't experienced what new windows are like.

691
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:43,808
Scott: imagine if they always opened and closed Easily and just right all the time.

692
00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:45,454
Scott: they locked perfectly.

693
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:48,846
Scott: they could sort of swing out to Ventilate in many different ways.

694
00:42:49,148 --> 00:42:50,834
Scott: the glass was very insulated.

695
00:42:50,854 --> 00:42:52,240
Rym: There's no draft at all.

696
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,346
Scott: Yeah, it just perfect.

697
00:42:53,366 --> 00:43:00,540
Scott: you know you want to stick something like an air conditioner or window fan And it just fits perfectly because it's a modern correctly sized standard window.

698
00:43:00,941 --> 00:43:05,700
Scott: It's not a cheap piece of wooden shit that's getting stuck or expanding and contracting with the cold and the heat.

699
00:43:06,122 --> 00:43:08,796
Scott: It's plastic with glass and it's it's a real window.

700
00:43:08,957 --> 00:43:16,931
Rym: speaking of windows I don't want to talk a little bit about HVAC because I Miss having proper heating and cooling in a house.

701
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:25,469
Scott: Yeah, I mean I've been in houses that have the central air You know and the you know the better heat and it is super nice But I've never actually lived anywhere that has it.

702
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,560
Scott: I could live without it, but I would really like it.

703
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:39,959
Rym: Yeah it's having to deal with you know like the window air conditioner is sort of annoying and use a lot of electricity and also having the Wall radiant heat is one of the worst ways of heating house you have.

704
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:42,008
Scott: well We have like you know that.

705
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,207
Scott: the problem is we live up in the Northeast where you know It's the old part of the country.

706
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:48,860
Scott: You know not like California or such where it's much newer.

707
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,144
Scott: you know so many.

708
00:43:50,284 --> 00:43:54,799
Scott: you know the houses were built with much older technology and no one updates a lot of these things.

709
00:43:54,859 --> 00:44:01,412
Scott: the house because It's so expensive and only newly built houses have the new technologies like the house I lived in in sterling heights was built in the 70s.

710
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:02,580
Rym: So it had pretty much modern.

711
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,485
Scott: I think aren't my parents.

712
00:44:03,505 --> 00:44:04,893
Scott: I was built maybe like the 40s.

713
00:44:04,954 --> 00:44:08,569
Rym: I guess yeah the house I lived in in Detroit was built like 1918.

714
00:44:08,569 --> 00:44:14,493
Scott: Yeah, there are houses like you know in my town Like around here that were built in the 17 18 ancient times.

715
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:18,840
Rym: This house was so like old and renovated that we didn't have central air.

716
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:26,378
Rym: That house was just old like Detroit disaster But we had air conditioners mounted in the wall not in windows, but in the wall.

717
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:26,779
Scott: Yep.

718
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:28,351
Scott: Yep I know how it has like that.

719
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,320
Rym: Yeah, it really sucked.

720
00:44:29,822 --> 00:44:32,939
Scott: Yeah, but at least you could replace it with a better air conditioner.

721
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:37,178
Rym: but I you know you think oh what why does it matter if you have ducted heat and cooling and all that?

722
00:44:37,238 --> 00:44:47,254
Rym: but All right in my room now, especially in the winter I got a humidifier and in the summer And I got a deal with the fact that the one part of the rooms war once card whatever.

723
00:44:47,856 --> 00:44:53,771
Rym: in a real house with normal HVAC You can just set the temperature in every room and it stays that temperature.

724
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:56,440
Rym: you pick a humidity and the whole house stays that humidity.

725
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:04,936
Rym: I've never actually seen a house that has the humidity control, but pretty much every Modern house with central heating and cooling has a humidifier built in.

726
00:45:05,157 --> 00:45:05,900
Scott: I've never seen that.

727
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,563
Scott: I've never seen it.

728
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:10,792
Scott: I guess you know I've seen dehumidifier because an air conditioner is a dehumidifier It's just part of the furnace.

729
00:45:10,812 --> 00:45:17,880
Scott: you don't even see Humidifying controls in any house even the one you know newish ones with central air.

730
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,251
Rym: I've never found the digital thermostat.

731
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:20,902
Rym: people might not know how to use it But it's there.

732
00:45:21,002 --> 00:45:22,426
Scott: I've never seen it before in my life.

733
00:45:22,606 --> 00:45:25,274
Rym: modern stove stoves modern furnaces have.

734
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:27,460
Scott: I'll temporarily take your word for it.

735
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,671
Scott: I'm just saying I've never seen it before.

736
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:29,740
Scott: I mean it must exist.

737
00:45:29,841 --> 00:45:30,754
Scott: It's kind of common.

738
00:45:30,774 --> 00:45:34,880
Rym: you know besides How often you go to someone's house then just go go to the thermostat and start poking around in it.

739
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,836
Scott: I poke at them quite often actually especially places where it's you know fancy houses.

740
00:45:38,896 --> 00:45:41,790
Rym: you also poke at Alarm systems that you don't know what they do.

741
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,680
Scott: yeah, I poke at lots of things, and then they go off.

742
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:57,860
Rym: I'm not lying about poking at things but and also having the centralized HVAC Set up properly means that the whole house is ventilated properly because a lot of houses actually are not ventilated properly.

743
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:05,995
Rym: It's actually a science in terms of how to make sure a house circulates air Oxygen and all that through all the rooms and ventilates out.

744
00:46:06,015 --> 00:46:07,060
Scott: you know bad stuff.

745
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,004
Scott: Yeah, I mean one of the.

746
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:11,780
Scott: you know when you're doing architecture one of the most difficult parts is you know okay?

747
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,140
Scott: You design a house so things line up and the house won't fall apart.

748
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:24,219
Scott: You know that's hard, and then you design it so the house actually practical and good for living and you know traffic Or people going around the house is nice and easy and you know that's hard again.

749
00:46:24,802 --> 00:46:27,433
Scott: Now you to make sure air goes around the house properly.

750
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,040
Scott: I see that's the super hardest part.

751
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:31,629
Rym: I can say this our house now does not do that.

752
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:34,640
Rym: our house is not HVAC whatever it's like.

753
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:36,855
Scott: It's not terrible, but it's it's not part.

754
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:37,480
Scott: It's not good.

755
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,006
Scott: It's not like the best it could.

756
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:44,710
Rym: closing doors in this house definitely makes room stuffy Which it shouldn't yeah, and there's lots of times.

757
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:50,505
Scott: You'll see like doors in this house opening closing on their own Happen plus.

758
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:52,720
Rym: I also miss having an attic fan a lot.

759
00:46:53,461 --> 00:46:56,920
Scott: No, not the attic fan, but an attic to sort of shove shit into is nice.

760
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:59,475
Scott: Yeah, bodies know that or even like better like one of those attics.

761
00:46:59,495 --> 00:47:00,340
Scott: That's actually a room.

762
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,057
Scott: Those are nice, too.

763
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:01,722
Scott: But yeah

764
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:17,059
Rym: an attic fan actually I'd really love because that what they do is if it's cool like you want to ventilate the house Right you open all the windows Turn on the attic fan And it basically just pulls air in from every window in the house and shoots out through the attic And it makes like this perfect breeze in every room.

765
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:21,260
Rym: Yep, of course a lot of people turn them on without opening windows because they don't know better.

766
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:23,319
Rym: That's not something you should do, but anyway yeah.

767
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:26,388
Rym: But yeah enough talk about HVAC.

768
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:27,633
Rym: I want proper HVAC.

769
00:47:27,653 --> 00:47:31,820
Rym: I also want green HVAC I want a heat pump, and I want solar panels and skylights.

770
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,745
Rym: You see I only.

771
00:47:32,805 --> 00:47:35,760
Scott: well skylights are nice so I can look at the sky and whatever from in the house.

772
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,687
Scott: You know like if it's raining a skylight is way cool.

773
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:37,948
Rym: Also.

774
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,313
Rym: The natural light is really nice.

775
00:47:39,374 --> 00:47:49,214
Scott: Yeah the green stuff I obviously don't care about it for its greenness because I don't give a shit about that but because you're horrible But I care, but I do give a shit because it saves the fucking bills.

776
00:47:49,274 --> 00:47:56,919
Scott: if I'm paying this much money for a house Goddamn, I can like save my electric bill like super times and also the water bill will be super cheap, too.

777
00:47:57,643 --> 00:47:58,226
Rym: Yeah, that's the other.

778
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,619
Scott: I want a gigantic water eating bill be super cheap.

779
00:48:01,621 --> 00:48:05,540
Rym: Oh save so much money and solar panels and all that and you buy a new house.

780
00:48:05,701 --> 00:48:08,325
Rym: I can't get that so easily in an old house, but a new house I just put it in.

781
00:48:08,628 --> 00:48:10,060
Scott: yeah you buy a bunch of like equipment.

782
00:48:10,341 --> 00:48:16,319
Scott: You know with your mortgage money, and then your bills that you actually have to pay month to month and not so big.

783
00:48:16,339 --> 00:48:19,490
Scott: I Mean you know even just the central air alone.

784
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:23,148
Scott: if you get a normal central air conditioner Just an average run-of-the-mill one.

785
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:30,899
Scott: your house is super cool everywhere Right and you're paying less money for that than you're paying for like a few window air conditioners.

786
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:32,504
Scott: Totally awesome.

787
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:34,031
Rym: Yeah now.

788
00:48:34,272 --> 00:48:35,860
Rym: I mean that's we're thinking about this.

789
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,883
Rym: We're still looking most likely because there aren't We either.

790
00:48:38,964 --> 00:48:40,753
Rym: if we buy a new house is gonna be a McMansion.

791
00:48:41,195 --> 00:48:48,360
Rym: if you don't buy a McMansion We pretty much have to buy an existing house knock it down and build a new house on the ruins.

792
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:50,006
Scott: Yeah, it really you know.

793
00:48:50,066 --> 00:49:04,620
Scott: it kind of sucks out here where the houses are not so modern that you know if you want A house with like cat5 cables running to every room and all this stuff We got to have to buy a shit house and pay a fortune to renovate it buy a shit house knock it down or Buy a plot and put a modern house on it.

794
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,177
Rym: But there aren't so many plots and all the plots are owned by McMansion makers.

795
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:16,111
Rym: Yeah I've been looking at the floor plans and a lot of the McMansions Actually aren't that bad.

796
00:49:16,131 --> 00:49:19,757
Rym: we could we could pretty Cheaply turn them into what we wanted.

797
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:23,195
Scott: yeah The McMansions aren't really that bad in terms of floor plan.

798
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:28,379
Scott: my major problem with them Is that when you live in one you're living in this sort of community with a whole bunch of them?

799
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,289
Scott: See the kind of people that live in them.

800
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,256
Scott: I don't want to live next now.

801
00:49:31,296 --> 00:49:40,382
Rym: and also There's a way around that most of vegan doesn't have homeowners associations, and there are crappy old houses for 180 to $200,000.

802
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:41,960
Rym: let's knock it down there.

803
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,905
Scott: They're yeah, but it's a bit.

804
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:44,735
Scott: you need a lot of land to put one of those things.

805
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:45,600
Rym: There's enough land?

806
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,124
Scott: Yeah, you got to make sure.

807
00:49:47,164 --> 00:49:51,898
Rym: the thing is the McMansion builders will build pretty much wherever you want them to.

808
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:59,255
Rym: so if we get A plot we could build a McMansion on it and as long as we worked with Contractors to get the green stuff put in and all the things we want you

809
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:02,273
Scott: got to be up to code And there's all sorts of laws you got to follow.

810
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:03,420
Rym: yeah, that's that's anywhere.

811
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,730
Scott: Yeah, but you got to check all that shit out before you buy the plot.

812
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:08,668
Scott: because what if the plot isn't big enough to have All the shit we want?

813
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:09,757
Rym: I know all about that.

814
00:50:10,622 --> 00:50:11,430
Scott: Just say you know it's.

815
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:12,440
Scott: it's a tricky situation.

816
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,040
Scott: You can't just be like oh get any old plot of land and get the perfect house on it.

817
00:50:16,301 --> 00:50:18,698
Scott: No, you got to get a good big enough plot of land with.

818
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:22,531
Rym: yes You have to do research for all this.

819
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:24,080
Rym: yeah, we're not talking about in this show.

820
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,396
Rym: We're talking about we want not what we're gonna do because.

821
00:50:26,436 --> 00:50:30,533
Scott: but to go back I didn't get to talk about how doors are just as important as windows because they are.

822
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:39,606
Scott: how many doors in your house don't actually Close easily or properly or how many of them like have locks that don't work or low-quality knobs Or you know shit like that.

823
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:41,693
Scott: like the root the doors to my room.

824
00:50:41,733 --> 00:50:48,958
Scott: right one of them kind of flaps around Right and the other and you have to like really pull it tight to get it to shut my closet door in the.

825
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:53,600
Scott: in the summer You can't close it because it expands and in the winter You know it closes nicely.

826
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:58,036
Scott: You know I should get a fucking door that opens and closes perfectly like a chunk a chunk all the time.

827
00:50:58,076 --> 00:51:00,750
Scott: the handles actually work The locks actually work.

828
00:51:01,112 --> 00:51:05,175
Scott: that sort of thing is small But it actually makes your life a lot better when all the doors in your house.

829
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,200
Scott: Just kind of work properly.

830
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:08,554
Rym: Yeah, also sound isolation and that sort of thing.

831
00:51:08,614 --> 00:51:19,590
Rym: and speaking of that We're getting to the point where I don't think we need a like to room with the glass panel like dedicated recording studio But we need some sort of recording studio.

832
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:24,808
Rym: doing this in my room is getting more and more annoying Yeah, and I'm a big problem with it.

833
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:25,249
Scott: so much.

834
00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:26,012
Rym: Yeah, plus.

835
00:51:26,052 --> 00:51:28,720
Rym: I'd like to kind of separate work and life from bed.

836
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,860
Rym: I like my bedroom to be a small desk with my laptop and a bed.

837
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:41,580
Scott: I definitely do want to get the computers out of my room You know and I want to have a bedroom that is for Bedrooming and I want to have a separate room that is sort of for office computer.

838
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:45,960
Scott: And you know having the computer in the bedroom is sort of like okay those days are over.

839
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:51,119
Scott: That's sort of like the you know college high school because I can't afford to have another room.

840
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:53,718
Scott: deal You know and it's like all right time to get another room.

841
00:51:54,465 --> 00:51:59,513
Rym: Yeah, but I mean briefly also I want a kitchen with a lot of counter space and stainless steel.

842
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,220
Scott: I want a kitchen with an island.

843
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:07,103
Rym: Yes, the island is key the island where you can lift up the center and now there's a griddle, but otherwise It's just an island.

844
00:52:07,604 --> 00:52:11,135
Rym: ah yeah, it's pretty fancy, and I want a nice stove.

845
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:12,700
Rym: all that business, but that's that's not interesting.

846
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:19,020
Rym: But also I think the area for the most improvement would be the bathroom because why don't you just have a bathroom?

847
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,440
Rym: Where everything in its waterproof, and you have a shower stall?

848
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:22,841
Rym: I don't.

849
00:52:22,901 --> 00:52:23,966
Rym: I'd like a separate tub.

850
00:52:24,288 --> 00:52:26,860
Rym: shower stall is for washing tub is for bubble bath.

851
00:52:26,921 --> 00:52:29,660
Scott: Yeah, if you only like one tub in the house You're not gonna use it that often.

852
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:33,920
Scott: That's why the tub would also have to be some sort of jacuzzi hot tub and have many moods.

853
00:52:34,823 --> 00:52:36,459
Rym: Oh could get the we could get the outdoor hot tub.

854
00:52:36,841 --> 00:52:38,569
Scott: Yeah, you could do that, then you don't need a tub at all.

855
00:52:38,769 --> 00:52:40,838
Rym: the problem is you have one hot tub.

856
00:52:40,918 --> 00:52:47,179
Rym: pretty much Undoes all the green we did and then some you realize how much energy hot tubs use.

857
00:52:47,319 --> 00:52:48,278
Scott: well You're only gonna use it.

858
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,224
Scott: You know so often.

859
00:52:49,324 --> 00:52:52,577
Rym: even then you know how much they use like on an hour-per-hour basis.

860
00:52:52,618 --> 00:52:53,140
Rym: It's crazy.

861
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,500
Rym: Yeah, they also require a lot of money to maintain.

862
00:52:56,181 --> 00:52:58,099
Scott: You can get like a sauna or something right?

863
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,853
Rym: Sonnet be the hot coals and then whatever but even then that that's it.

864
00:53:02,874 --> 00:53:06,540
Rym: going into the realm of would be nice Yeah, just sort of like a luxury item.

865
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:08,648
Rym: But I want a bathroom where one.

866
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,840
Rym: I'd like to full bathrooms instead of one and a half bathrooms.

867
00:53:12,402 --> 00:53:14,611
Scott: Yeah, well what I want is you know I want to have.

868
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:17,040
Scott: you know I definitely got to be more than one shower.

869
00:53:17,101 --> 00:53:19,648
Scott: But I kind of like you know when I was a kid I didn't.

870
00:53:19,689 --> 00:53:28,831
Scott: when I was younger I didn't like these sort of bathrooms that were attached to bedrooms, but now I kind of really like that action Especially when you're living with more a lot of people.

871
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:33,592
Scott: what I like having the separate bathrooms You know just like you know shower stall and a sink in a toilet.

872
00:53:34,053 --> 00:53:35,780
Scott: it for each bedroom is kind of awesome.

873
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:42,420
Rym: But I like the idea of having like a you know shower stalls and bathrooms for normal stuff And then a tub for just taking a nice bath.

874
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:52,133
Rym: But beyond all that the bathroom should be all Waterproof and have a drain in the floor so that when I when it's time to clean the bathroom I just power wash the whole thing.

875
00:53:52,153 --> 00:53:52,980
Rym: it takes five minutes.

876
00:53:53,321 --> 00:53:58,900
Scott: Yeah, definitely nothing in the bathroom should be made of wood and no wall in the bathroom should be painted or wallpapered.

877
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,074
Scott: It should be all tile or stay steel.

878
00:54:02,396 --> 00:54:03,280
Scott: I guess you don't want to steal to.

879
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:05,673
Scott: What's toilets made of?

880
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:06,985
Rym: porcelain.

881
00:54:07,006 --> 00:54:10,098
Rym: porcelain You know what you know actually?

882
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,141
Scott: Metal.

883
00:54:11,201 --> 00:54:13,128
Scott: those should be the only things your bathroom is made of.

884
00:54:13,228 --> 00:54:16,680
Rym: ideally I'd like to separate bathing and going to the bathroom.

885
00:54:17,681 --> 00:54:19,828
Scott: Yeah, so necessary that's sort of.

886
00:54:19,848 --> 00:54:23,620
Scott: it's sort of like an insane high-priced luxury to have a separate.

887
00:54:23,883 --> 00:54:24,792
Rym: That's definitely in the.

888
00:54:24,852 --> 00:54:25,580
Rym: wouldn't it be nice?

889
00:54:26,461 --> 00:54:29,360
Scott: Yeah, you know generally when you design a house, right?

890
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:35,240
Scott: You want to have sort of like as many of the plumbing things like the bathrooms and things vertically aligned.

891
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:42,206
Scott: So you'd have a bathroom directly under it on the floor below the other bathroom That the hot water heater.

892
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:46,020
Scott: that way the plumbing is much simpler and cheaper and everything works.

893
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:59,151
Rym: I think the simplest most ideal way would be to have the upstairs bathroom is like a shower Tub like we have now and then below that on the main floor is a shower stall full bathroom And then in the basement under that is just a bathroom.

894
00:54:59,472 --> 00:54:59,733
Scott: Yeah.

895
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:01,620
Scott: Oh basement bathrooms always cool.

896
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,849
Rym: You always had a basement bathroom and every house I lived in you need the best thing about basement bathroom right?

897
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:07,938
Scott: is you can fool around in the backyard or something.

898
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:14,520
Scott: then take the Secret entrance to the basement, you know directly from the outside and then get people to clean off in the shitty-ass basement bathroom.

899
00:55:15,162 --> 00:55:16,820
Rym: Also, if you're hanging out in the basement bathroom.

900
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:20,320
Rym: It's nice that plus when we have 15 people over two bathrooms are not enough.

901
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:22,787
Rym: No Now this is also one of those wouldn't it be?

902
00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:26,683
Scott: you need you need a gigantic water heater to handle all those bathrooms going at once.

903
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:28,277
Rym: this is wouldn't it be nice?

904
00:55:28,378 --> 00:55:42,269
Rym: but Honestly if because I wouldn't want a lot of people to live in the house but a lot of people would come to the house a lot a lot of open like common rooms that people would come over and use but in the basement instead of It'll always be worth it to have a urinal.

905
00:55:42,912 --> 00:55:46,486
Rym: nah just for the sheer number of guys Yeah, yes, then in that trough.

906
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:47,710
Rym: No, not a trough.

907
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:48,995
Rym: I don't think we need a trough.

908
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:50,480
Rym: That's that's that's NASCAR.

909
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:55,157
Rym: Hey, but a urinal would actually be really useful and would save a lot of water.

910
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:56,764
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it would.

911
00:55:56,784 --> 00:55:58,713
Scott: the thing is I don't know how to clean urinal.

912
00:55:59,275 --> 00:56:01,264
Rym: She's put the cake in it And I don't know.

913
00:56:01,384 --> 00:56:03,352
Rym: we hired someone to clean the urinal.

914
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:04,557
Rym: you just scrub it Scott.

915
00:56:04,577 --> 00:56:05,360
Rym: It's like any toilet.

916
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:07,113
Scott: You can clean it.

917
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:08,040
Rym: it's no different.

918
00:56:08,482 --> 00:56:12,299
Rym: In fact, I'd rather clean a urinal because a urinal just has one thing going into it.

919
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,831
Rym: Hope you know what I'd like unless urinal poop calm.

920
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:15,232
Scott: You know what?

921
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,920
Scott: I just thought of something I'd like in the bathroom.

922
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,412
Rym: What'd you like in the bathroom of those hand dryer dealies?

923
00:56:20,196 --> 00:56:21,987
Rym: Yeah Yeah, those.

924
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:22,912
Scott: the thing is they have this.

925
00:56:22,973 --> 00:56:23,174
Rym: no.

926
00:56:23,235 --> 00:56:24,080
Rym: No, no, we don't need that.

927
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:29,160
Rym: The only reason you get that is because you don't want to waste money and and resources on having those stupid paper towels.

928
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:33,417
Scott: Oh, but you see they have this new kind that doesn't actually heat doesn't blow with hot air.

929
00:56:33,678 --> 00:56:35,540
Scott: what it does It blows up high-pressure airs.

930
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,491
Scott: you just kind of put your hands in and it goes whoop and you're dry.

931
00:56:38,631 --> 00:56:42,947
Rym: but we have the luxury because we live it here of Just uh having towels.

932
00:56:43,268 --> 00:56:48,305
Scott: I actually like the hand the air dryer better than towels for hand drying Not for body drying.

933
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:52,160
Scott: But anyway, I guess I would like for body drying but a dryer that large would be too much money.

934
00:56:52,441 --> 00:56:54,574
Scott: I'd have to like go to the car wash to dry off my entire body.

935
00:56:54,614 --> 00:56:56,987
Rym: I hate to say this but We probably.

936
00:56:57,027 --> 00:57:00,849
Rym: it would be nice that now we could integrate this with the computer room den But we might need.

937
00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:04,867
Rym: we don't need a separate dining room But we definitely need a library of some kind.

938
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:07,262
Scott: Yeah, I mean I Should.

939
00:57:07,463 --> 00:57:12,220
Scott: I really should get more bookshelves already, but I don't have any place to put them.

940
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,670
Rym: It's not just books but board games and all that stuff.

941
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,453
Rym: We really need.

942
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:24,860
Scott: I mean if I had a bigger house They're probably every free wall space would probably have shelves on it, you know Eventually, so it's really just a matter of having more space.

943
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,954
Scott: But if there is a spare room to dedicate to just bookshelves That's really cool cuz like a quiet place to read.

944
00:57:30,974 --> 00:57:39,400
Rym: when I when I was a kid It was a fun room to decorate You know, we we had a dining room and a living room and a family room and the kitchen had basically a dining room in it.

945
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:40,994
Rym: I don't need a separate dining room.

946
00:57:41,034 --> 00:57:41,579
Rym: That's just silly.

947
00:57:41,941 --> 00:57:42,584
Scott: well, it's it's.

948
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:55,579
Scott: what's cool is if you have like sort of like a like a portal from like the Kitchen to the diet to like another area then you can sort of get a table when you need it to go through the portal To get a long table for when you need a long table.

949
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:06,940
Rym: But anyway, what I'm thinking is when I was a kid we had the Dining room which was next to the kitchen, but there's a door between him And then there was the the nook which was bigger than our current kitchen where we normally ate.

950
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,407
Rym: That's where the real dining room table was.

951
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:13,264
Rym: So we turned the dining room into the library and Also the aviary.

952
00:58:13,284 --> 00:58:18,484
Rym: we put all the birds in there because we it's not like it was valuable rare books that the bird Feathers would ruin.

953
00:58:18,524 --> 00:58:18,886
Rym: it was just.

954
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:23,949
Rym: that was a way to have a multi-purpose room that actually worked really well And it was really nice to.

955
00:58:24,393 --> 00:58:31,760
Rym: you know Like on a weekend I'd go into the library and there were just two nice wicker chairs in there and all the books and I'd Get my book and I just wicker chairs.

956
00:58:32,662 --> 00:58:37,320
Rym: Well, they had nice pads because my mom was on a kind of African safari kind of cake.

957
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:45,265
Rym: So the house was outfitted like one of those Like you see in the movies like where Teddy Roosevelt would stay when he's out hunting Animals, I never

958
00:58:45,305 --> 00:58:51,133
Scott: understood like you go to like these fancy mansions, you know, I see at every fancy house I ever see especially like we're rich people the room

959
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,360
Rym: where there's nothing anyone can touch.

960
00:58:52,642 --> 00:59:02,952
Scott: No, not that but like in the backyard They'll have like the table the steel like iron Like cast-iron really fancily ornate like chairs and table like an.

961
00:59:03,152 --> 00:59:05,177
Scott: and I'm like, how can you sit on that?

962
00:59:05,217 --> 00:59:08,844
Rym: It's so uncomfortable I would like to have.

963
00:59:08,864 --> 00:59:09,928
Rym: it's like the fans here.

964
00:59:09,968 --> 00:59:12,597
Scott: It's like the fancier the furniture the more uncomfortable it is.

965
00:59:12,697 --> 00:59:17,840
Rym: Yeah All right, I think we've talked enough about the house we want to buy.

966
00:59:18,342 --> 00:59:24,291
Scott: I don't know if I want birds in like the library though because I was sort of Sort of defeat the quietness of the library.

967
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:25,014
Rym: Well, see as a kid.

968
00:59:25,034 --> 00:59:26,460
Rym: It was really I was used to the birds.

969
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,511
Rym: I've lived with birds my whole life.

970
00:59:27,571 --> 00:59:28,380
Rym: It was kind of comforting.

971
00:59:28,681 --> 00:59:34,260
Rym: Yeah, I guess if you're I don't think we're gonna have a menagerie of birds in the new house.

972
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,815
Scott: No, I don't think I'm not gonna have 20 birds.

973
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,390
Rym: No, I think we have any 15 of which are zebra finches going.

974
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,356
Rym: meh meh meh meh meh.

975
00:59:42,396 --> 00:59:43,860
Scott: Yeah, you can keep birds in your room.

976
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,161
Scott: They're.

977
00:59:44,462 --> 00:59:46,350
Rym: I might get about pregnant parrotlet or something.

978
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:48,800
Scott: I like little if I'm hearing it around the house.

979
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,804
Rym: Teach it to talk.

980
00:59:51,326 --> 00:59:54,034
Scott: Yeah, if it says Rym is stupid then you can keep it.

981
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:55,258
Rym: I'll teach you that.

982
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:57,626
Rym: Oh, no All right.
