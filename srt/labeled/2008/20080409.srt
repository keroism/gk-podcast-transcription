1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,346
Rym: It's Wednesday, April 9th.

2
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:12,128
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:12,911
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,335
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,840
Rym: Tonight, kind of a cop-out.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,460
Rym: We talk a bit about newspaper comics, but mostly we argue about whether or not Opus was a puffin or a penguin or a platypus.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,967
Rym: So as you all know, Otakon's artist alley sold out immediately as it always does and...

9
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:38,719
Scott: Well, I wonder, I mean way back in the day, right?

10
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,790
Scott: It must have not sold out right away, right?

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,909
Scott: I wonder what the first Otakon where it sold out that quickly was.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,571
Scott: I don't know.

13
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:47,081
Scott: I mean in 2000, did it sell out that quickly?

14
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,610
Rym: All I know is the last three or four years.

15
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,036
Rym: it's been pretty hard to get a table.

16
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:51,979
Scott: That's for sure.

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:01:04,349
Rym: But the front row crew was together with it and I'm gonna save the details for later, but it's very likely that the front row crew and affiliated artists may be taking up almost an entire island.

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:05,734
Scott: Oh my god.

19
00:01:05,835 --> 00:01:07,789
Rym: And the thing is it's not like, "Oh, it's Geek

20
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:07,970
Rym: Nights.".

21
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:12,309
Rym: It's pretty much all the artists who are friends with us or who work with us.

22
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:20,286
Scott: Yeah, it's gonna be, there's gonna be like a whole front row crew section so we can turn it into like a party zone or something.

23
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:20,728
Scott: I don't know.

24
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:21,010
Scott: We should...

25
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,488
Rym: And Dave and Joel, because Dave Riley was like, "Man, I totally didn't get a

26
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:25,830
Rym: table.".

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,999
Rym: And I was like, "Yeah, you want one?

28
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:28,047
Rym: We got an extra

29
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:28,289
Rym: one.".

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,695
Scott: Yeah, we had a couple extra.

31
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,443
Scott: We might dump one of the tables.

32
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:32,005
Scott: We might...

33
00:01:32,447 --> 00:01:33,170
Rym: We already dumped one.

34
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,163
Scott: Oh, we got to bring, we got, we have I think still a spare table though.

35
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:37,550
Scott: We got to bring in somebody.

36
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,877
Rym: Well, we're working on that.

37
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:40,670
Rym: I have a use for that table regardless.

38
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:45,724
Rym: But anyway, I got a very interesting email from Oticon.

39
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:46,587
Rym: This wasn't sent to me.

40
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:47,510
Rym: It was sent to everyone.

41
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:49,162
Scott: Well, everyone who?

42
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,850
Rym: Everyone who signed up for a table.

43
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:52,328
Scott: Oh, okay.

44
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:59,069
Rym: It is as far... Actually, oh, I just realized that they made a slight mistake and I have a list of everyone who they sent it to.

45
00:01:59,355 --> 00:01:59,590
Scott: Awesome.

46
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,004
Rym: But anyway, that happens a lot to a lot of people.

47
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:02,970
Rym: I can't complain about it.

48
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:04,610
Scott: Learn to use emails.

49
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:05,031
Rym: "Hello.

50
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:11,250
Rym: We were just sending out a reminder to everyone about sending payments since there has been some confusion regarding forms of payment.

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:20,130
Rym: Only payment in the form of certified cashier's check, money order or postal money order made payable to Otocorp Incorporated will be accepted.

52
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,906
Rym: Do not send cash or personal

53
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:22,229
Rym: checks.".

54
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,229
Rym: Now, this was quite clear.

55
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,490
Scott: Do you want to teach all the listeners about certified checks, money orders and postal money order?

56
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:28,690
Scott: All

57
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:45,410
Rym: I want to say is that I didn't even think about this problem, but in retrospect, and I don't blame Otocorp for not thinking about this problem either, but it's a smart move on their part because checks are not the most reliable form of paying for things and they're also a gigantic pain.

58
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:47,509
Rym: If you got a million of them, you got to cash them all.

59
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,310
Scott: Yeah, a personal check is, you know, someone could just, you know, bounce it.

60
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:53,288
Scott: You know, you might not get the money and then it's...

61
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,070
Rym: Well, you can charge, you can get the money.

62
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:55,460
Rym: It's more...

63
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,609
Scott: But it's a pain in the ass.

64
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,790
Rym: Yeah, it's more an issue that cashing all those checks is usually long delays and all sorts of problems.

65
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:05,330
Rym: So instead, they required, you know, a money order, a certified check.

66
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:08,650
Scott: And using a credit card or something like that, there's problems with that, too.

67
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,050
Scott: You got to pay the fees, the processing fees, or you got to, if you want to use PayPal, you got to pay PayPal fees.

68
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:21,730
Rym: But anyway, it was a very smart move on Otocorp's part to accept only these forms of payment because then only people who are serious about having a table will get one.

69
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:37,570
Rym: But the problem here that I did not really anticipate was that I imagine the majority of the people who signed up for a table have never heard of any of these things, because many times in my life I have been asked by someone at some point, what do you mean a money order?

70
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,870
Rym: Most people, especially younger people, don't seem to know about certified checks or money orders.

71
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,129
Scott: So let me teach you about certified checks and money orders.

72
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:57,730
Scott: OK, a certified check, when you write a personal check, right, you know, if you check book, what that does is you give it to someone and then when they take it to their bank, their bank tries to get money from your bank.

73
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,278
Scott: And you can write a check.

74
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,490
Scott: I could write a check for a million dollars and give it to him.

75
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:11,030
Scott: And he can be like, OK, but if he won't find out that it's a bad check until he takes it to his bank, what you can do is you can go to your own bank.

76
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,810
Scott: I could go to my bank and say, I need a certified check for a million dollars.

77
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,988
Rym: Most banks will do it for free.

78
00:04:17,271 --> 00:04:17,696
Scott: It's free.

79
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,170
Scott: If you have an account, you need an account.

80
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:19,492
Scott: Right.

81
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:23,050
Scott: And they will look at my account and say, oh, there's a million dollars.

82
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,070
Scott: I will give you the certified check.

83
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:29,043
Scott: If there isn't a million dollars, they won't give me a certified check.

84
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:30,910
Scott: so you can give someone a certified check.

85
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,290
Scott: And basically that means it has a stamp.

86
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,570
Scott: It's like the seal of approval.

87
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,070
Scott: Yes, Scott has this much money in his bank account, so it's guaranteed not to bounce.

88
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:42,430
Rym: Now, there's also a cashier's check, but that's not quite the same thing.

89
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,650
Rym: It's not as reliable.

90
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,150
Rym: In fact, there were a lot of scams in the 90s involving cashier's check.

91
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:52,050
Scott: Now, a money order, a postal money order is the most convenient kind, as far as I'm concerned.

92
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,430
Scott: I'm not a big fan of the other kinds, but basically a postal money order.

93
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:56,690
Scott: You go to the post office.

94
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:57,494
Scott: Right.

95
00:04:57,555 --> 00:04:59,010
Scott: And let's say I want a mail Rym.

96
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,021
Scott: Thirty dollars.

97
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:00,590
Scott: Right.

98
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:03,790
Scott: I go and I say I would like a postal money order for thirty dollars.

99
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:08,210
Scott: I give the post office thirty dollars plus, you know, a fee.

100
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,774
Rym: Cash only.

101
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,950
Rym: They will not accept anything but cash.

102
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,946
Scott: I think you can do the...

103
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:13,098
Rym: No, you can't.

104
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:14,430
Rym: Most definitely not.

105
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:16,330
Rym: That's always, always been that way.

106
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,610
Rym: That's the point of a money order.

107
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:19,150
Rym: It's as good as cash.

108
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:19,972
Scott: Right.

109
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:22,829
Scott: So I give, you know, the bank thirty dollars plus a fee.

110
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,450
Scott: Then they give me this money order and they print on it, you know, thirty dollars.

111
00:05:27,832 --> 00:05:32,130
Scott: And then I write like Rym's address and my name and address and you fill out these little forms.

112
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:36,910
Scott: And then that little piece of paper or whatever goes and gets mailed to Rym.

113
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:41,109
Rym: Well, no, most often they give you it like a check and then you do whatever you want with it.

114
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,670
Scott: Well, usually mail it right there, because that's the point of a postal money order is to mail it to somebody.

115
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,130
Rym: Most people I've seen, they tend to get a money order and then use it like a check.

116
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:49,990
Rym: Oh, really?

117
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,690
Rym: In fact, most money orders, if you go to a post office and ask for a money order, they don't ask or care who it's for.

118
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,870
Rym: They give you a blank money order that's certified for the amount of money.

119
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:01,189
Scott: Every time I bought a postal money order is to mail it.

120
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,717
Rym: So, yeah, but I'm saying they don't.

121
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,690
Rym: they usually don't care who you're writing it to.

122
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,774
Scott: No, they don't care at all.

123
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:10,250
Rym: But, you know, you it's just a check that is backed by the post office.

124
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:11,098
Scott: Yeah, it is.

125
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:12,390
Scott: It's all technically is.

126
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,689
Scott: But usually you mail it.

127
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:14,890
Rym: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

128
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,410
Rym: The point is that a lot of anime fans, I don't think, understood this.

129
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:25,170
Rym: And I am sure that a lot of punk kids sent Otakon cash in the mail and or personal checks.

130
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:31,670
Rym: And this reminder is a nice little, hey, kids, just so you know, go to the post office or your bank.

131
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,170
Rym: But, yeah, we'll have some announcements about the front row crew things going on in the artist alley.

132
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,150
Rym: We're pretty much going to set up a blog website for all the artists.

133
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,870
Rym: And you're going to get to see kind of previews of what's going on and all the people and all the artists who are going to be there.

134
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,690
Scott: We're going to try to hype it up like an event.

135
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,110
Rym: I think you're really going to like what all of our artist friends have to offer.

136
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,450
Scott: Yeah, artist friends, don't drop the ball.

137
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:56,276
Rym: Doesn't matter.

138
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,610
Rym: They have to pay for the tables anyway.

139
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,156
Rym: You know what?

140
00:06:59,007 --> 00:06:59,190
Scott: I know.

141
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,710
Scott: But I don't want to show up with like you like two pictures.

142
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,090
Rym: I don't think that's going to happen.

143
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,070
Scott: I don't think it's going to happen either.

144
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,470
Scott: But, you know, if you if you don't prod the cattle, it doesn't move.

145
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,910
Scott: And if it isn't going to move, but it's not moving right now, prodding it makes it move faster.

146
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,549
Rym: I think they're all excited about it.

147
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,634
Scott: They they're all excited.

148
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:17,210
Scott: But, you know, once I forced everyone to laziness happens, it has happened before.

149
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:20,420
Rym: Anyway.

150
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,109
Rym: OK, so you have a news.

151
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,450
Scott: Oh, you want me to do my news?

152
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:22,918
Rym: Yeah, sure.

153
00:07:22,938 --> 00:07:23,369
Rym: All right.

154
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:35,709
Scott: Well, I don't really have a news because I looked at the news and mostly the only real news we have is what's going down at the New York Comic-Con in a couple of weeks and events near it and related to it.

155
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:40,650
Scott: And I'll leave that to Rym exactly how much we should reveal and with what timing.

156
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:48,010
Scott: Other than that, most of the anime comic news is sort of I think they're keeping it real quiet because they're going to bust out like crazy at the Comic-Con.

157
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,149
Scott: So it's sort of like they're holding back all the cars and then they're going to reveal them all at once.

158
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:54,910
Scott: So last was it last week?

159
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,870
Scott: I think I introduced Scott's box.

160
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:58,727
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

161
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,720
Rym: I'm reading stuff.

162
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:00,188
Rym: I don't care.

163
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:01,368
Rym: Oh, come on.

164
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,930
Rym: I don't read any of the things you get.

165
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,168
Rym: And you just did the box.

166
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,609
Rym: I really don't care about you doing it again right now.

167
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,230
Scott: Well, the thing is, is I did Scott's box like last week, I think.

168
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:14,749
Scott: And it actually a lot of people emailed me and they liked it.

169
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:20,750
Scott: And I was quite surprised that, you know, something that was basically a throwaway idea was basically like, oh, people care.

170
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:22,367
Scott: The question is, right.

171
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,990
Scott: What I did last week was I talked about the comics I just got in the mail.

172
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,330
Scott: Now, the problem with that is it's kind of like, OK, these some of them are a little stale, like they came out maybe a month ago even.

173
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,573
Scott: So I was trying to figure out.

174
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:44,630
Scott: I ask people, you know, should I talk about ones that I just got that might be a little stale or should I talk about the ones I'm ordering right now and I'm going to get in the future?

175
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:54,730
Rym: Now, I'll admit straight up, I pretty much feel one hundred percent that it should be the former, because at least then you can actually talk about and kind of review all the things you got.

176
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,391
Rym: Yeah.

177
00:08:55,411 --> 00:09:02,670
Rym: Meanwhile, now it's not know what none of our listeners, maybe one or two percent are going to actually do the preorder thing like you do.

178
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,670
Scott: Well, you don't have to do the preorder thing, right?

179
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:14,550
Scott: You can do is because a lot of the books that I order specifically, like most comic book stores will not have them, you know, because like they're they don't.

180
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,789
Scott: I think they're going to sell them their weird books and things.

181
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:27,790
Scott: So what you have to do is if you want a lot of these books, the only way to get them is to either preorder them or go to a comic book store and specifically tell them this is a book.

182
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:28,798
Scott: I want it.

183
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:29,768
Scott: You will get it for me.

184
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:30,331
Scott: Yeah.

185
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:36,430
Rym: But at the same time, without having any sort of editorial or review standpoint, it feels like it's almost useless.

186
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:40,350
Scott: But anyway, I decided to see what the people say.

187
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:41,670
Scott: I'm going to see what the people say.

188
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,215
Scott: Exactly.

189
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:43,408
Scott: So I'm going to do.

190
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:48,990
Scott: I'm going to tell you what I'm ordering in the month of April, most of which is shipping in the month of June.

191
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:54,130
Scott: And then I want people to email me and go to the forums and such.

192
00:09:54,551 --> 00:10:03,590
Scott: And maybe I'll set up a poll in the forum that's like, should Scott's box be, you know, stuff that already came in the mail, stuff that I'm ordering or just forget Scott's box.

193
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:09,610
Scott: So here's what I'm ordering in the month of April, ordering Black Magic second edition.

194
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:14,190
Scott: This is like the only Masamune Shiro manga I don't have.

195
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,388
Scott: So that's going to pretty much seal the deal.

196
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,450
Scott: Rym, you wanted that Amano tale of Genji hardcover.

197
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:26,550
Rym: Actually, I wanted all those Amano things, but I'm only going to get one because I can only have so much Amano in my life.

198
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:31,030
Scott: It's basically a big, fancy Amano illustrated novel.

199
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,050
Scott: Like it's not a comic so much as it's super fancy pictures with text next to them.

200
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:44,850
Rym: If you don't know who that is, look at like the art, the not the art from the game so much, but like the cover art from Final Fantasy four, like that sort of thing.

201
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,450
Scott: Or play Final Fantasy six and push go to the status menu and look at the characters faces.

202
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:50,537
Rym: It's that sort of art.

203
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,590
Rym: I really, really dig that art style.

204
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,693
Scott: Yoshitaka Amano.

205
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:58,570
Scott: Anyway, I'm getting rain in hell number one, only because it's eighty seven cents.

206
00:10:59,393 --> 00:10:59,876
Scott: I'm getting it.

207
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:01,790
Rym: That's a ringing endorsement right there.

208
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:02,573
Rym: Exactly.

209
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:05,866
Scott: I'm getting something called New York for.

210
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:06,770
Scott: I'm going to read this.

211
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,590
Scott: And Emily, this is like Emily's favorite comic, at least I'm guessing.

212
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:10,892
Scott: You ready?

213
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:12,910
Scott: OK, it's written by Brian Wood.

214
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,134
Scott: That's the.

215
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,347
Scott: I think he's the DMZ guy.

216
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:19,136
Rym: You sure?

217
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:19,679
Scott: Yes.

218
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,350
Scott: OK, Brian was the DMZ guy.

219
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,093
Scott: Ready?

220
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:25,529
Scott: Here is the advertising text for this book here.

221
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:28,808
Scott: Just starting your freshman year at NYU.

222
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:33,390
Scott: Riley is about to find out what an adventure and a mystery living in New York City could be.

223
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:40,370
Scott: The ultimate insider's guide to New York City is seen through the eyes of Brooklyn born Riley raised by stuffy literati parents.

224
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:46,990
Scott: Riley's a shy, straight A student who convinces three other NYU brainiacs to join a research group for fast cash.

225
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:54,430
Scott: What Riley doesn't bank on is accidentally falling in love with Arty, older sister's boyfriend, advanced solicited son, son, son.

226
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,953
Scott: Ten bucks.

227
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,970
Scott: Of course, I don't have to pay ten bucks.

228
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,774
Scott: I have to pay much less.

229
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:01,110
Scott: OK, let's see, DMZ volume five.

230
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:14,250
Rym: Speaking of Brian Wood, I'll admit I kind of liked DMZ, but it the suspension of disbelief as to the fact that that is where the battle lines were drawn is just too much.

231
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,430
Scott: I know that is hard for me to swallow.

232
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,010
Scott: And volume three, I was actually getting a little sour.

233
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:26,710
Scott: But when I read volume three, I heard already you ordered four and volume four did a lot to reinvigorate my DMZ interest.

234
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,530
Rym: Yeah, it's tough for me to get reinvigorated.

235
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,550
Rym: I mean, Walking Dead, I pretty much just dropped completely.

236
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,529
Rym: I can't imagine anything that would get me back into that.

237
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,822
Scott: No, but volume four, like volume three, DMZ was like.

238
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:38,750
Scott: volume four was like, oh, right.

239
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,574
Scott: That's why I like this.

240
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:42,590
Scott: tales from the Starlight drive in.

241
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,550
Scott: I'm buying this because it's sort of like a cool combination of like smaller stories all revolving around this drive in.

242
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:55,030
Scott: And, you know, they got the cool stuff going on with like what's on the screen versus the, you know, the people in the drive in.

243
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:57,290
Scott: And then there's supposed to be a twist ending, whatever.

244
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:57,855
Scott: We'll see that.

245
00:12:57,895 --> 00:12:58,624
Scott: We'll figure it out.

246
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,499
Scott: Killing Girl.

247
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,229
Scott: This is a comic.

248
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:04,490
Scott: The art was drawn by the Rocketo guy, Frank Espinosa.

249
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,069
Scott: So I buy it automatically pretty much that guy.

250
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:10,350
Scott: Yeah, of course, he didn't draw the art for all the issues.

251
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,030
Scott: He only drew the art for the first few and then someone else took over.

252
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:13,537
Scott: But whatever.

253
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:14,449
Scott: All right.

254
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,450
Scott: Scud, the disposable assassin, the whole shebang.

255
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:17,851
Scott: All right.

256
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:24,410
Scott: The reason I'm buying this is because it's supposed to be really funny and it's like eight hundred pages.

257
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:26,149
Scott: And I'm paying fourteen ninety nine.

258
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,529
Scott: So it's like the whole series in one book.

259
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:30,970
Scott: It's like unbelievable.

260
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,109
Scott: Sky doll number two of three.

261
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:40,030
Scott: This is actually really weird because this is like a French comic about a robot that Marvel's publishing.

262
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:42,350
Scott: And I'm like, holy shit, holy shit.

263
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,710
Scott: Marvel's publishing like a French comic in English.

264
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:48,385
Scott: So like, yeah, I'll buy three issues, you know, to show you that.

265
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,690
Scott: yes, this is a good idea.

266
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:53,669
Scott: Marvel Comics presents number 10 because I always get that.

267
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,530
Scott: Eternals by Neil Gaiman because it says Neil Gaiman.

268
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,508
Scott: And it's something old that he did, but I think it's a new printing and I've never read it.

269
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:08,310
Scott: Contract number zero because it's thirteen cents ringing endorsements all around.

270
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,208
Scott: Thirteen cents.

271
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:16,330
Rym: Oh, I know that a lot of times after Scott gets his box, there's a very large pile next to his bed of comics that were worthless.

272
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:17,678
Scott: Yup.

273
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,830
Scott: Mouse guard eleven fifty two.

274
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,642
Scott: Number five.

275
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:21,089
Rym: Oh, man.

276
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,950
Scott: The weasel sanctuary can't go wrong with mouse guard.

277
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:25,617
Scott: That's five of six.

278
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,908
Scott: So the one after that's going to be the end of chapter two.

279
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:28,975
Rym: Oh, man.

280
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,830
Rym: I like me some mouse guard.

281
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,290
Scott: Rabbi Harvey rides again.

282
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,670
Scott: I got the first Rabbi Harvey and it's pretty funny.

283
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:42,030
Scott: It's like this rabbi in the Old West telling the Proverbs and like, you know, sort of doing the King Solomon thing.

284
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:44,230
Rym: You know, there were no Jewish cowboys.

285
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:45,730
Scott: I know until Rabbi Harvey.

286
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,490
Scott: It's also funny because my dad's name is Harvey.

287
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:50,570
Scott: So it's kind of funny to show to your dad.

288
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:51,561
Scott: Yeah, he liked it.

289
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:52,370
Scott: That was funny.

290
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,230
Scott: But yeah, I'll get Rabbi Harvey the sequel.

291
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,268
Scott: Robot volume six.

292
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,574
Scott: Robot is the is.

293
00:14:57,614 --> 00:15:02,770
Scott: basically it's a giant, awesome manga art book.

294
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:03,769
Scott: Like it's huge.

295
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:06,350
Scott: It's full color on super shiny paper.

296
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:12,390
Scott: And you've got like Yoshitoshi Abe and what's his name?

297
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:13,569
Scott: That's the lane guy.

298
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:19,910
Scott: And you've got Rangemorata, the last exile guy and a whole bunch of other people in there.

299
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:25,170
Scott: And it's like the awesomest art from Japanese manga people in super full color.

300
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:28,969
Scott: And yeah, I'll keep getting it as long as they keep putting it out.

301
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:34,284
Scott: And the last thing on my list, Tezuka's Dororo volume two vertical.

302
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,230
Scott: Tezuka can't go wrong.

303
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:37,467
Rym: Pretty much a slam dunk.

304
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:39,610
Scott: That's the more than a slam dunk.

305
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:41,690
Scott: That's like a magnetic three pointer.

306
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:45,349
Scott: I don't know, three pointers that can't miss magnetic, eh?

307
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,668
Rym: Yeah, just stick to the Rym.

308
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,070
Scott: Well, yeah, that counts.

309
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:49,917
Rym: No, it doesn't.

310
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:50,928
Rym: It has to go through.

311
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,850
Rym: If it just sticks to the Rym, it doesn't count.

312
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:54,752
Scott: I don't know.

313
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:56,660
Scott: Point is, there's no way.

314
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:56,961
Scott: I'm not.

315
00:15:57,001 --> 00:16:00,509
Scott: if that had to if I had to order only one thing on this list, I would take that one.

316
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:01,215
Scott: That's for sure.

317
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,209
Rym: So is that Scott's box?

318
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:05,529
Scott: That's Scott's future box.

319
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,129
Scott: Scott's box to be box to be.

320
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:10,270
Scott: So tell me if you want to hear more.

321
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:11,610
Scott: I'm only doing one or the other.

322
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,290
Scott: We're not going to be like doing this every week.

323
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,150
Scott: It's going to be a once a month deal.

324
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,670
Scott: It's either going to be Scott's box to be or Scott's box.

325
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,661
Scott: He just got that.

326
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,248
Scott: Those are your choices.

327
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:24,305
Rym: I still lean toward the box.

328
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:25,169
Rym: that has already been.

329
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:25,752
Scott: I'm a little.

330
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:31,950
Scott: I'm leaning towards that, too, you know, because like most of these things will arrive two months from now, but some of them will not.

331
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:38,970
Scott: And, you know, there's also some things I ordered in the past, you know, possibly a long time ago that are going to show up like next month, you know, I just think about it.

332
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,509
Rym: And we either have, well, this was crap.

333
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,241
Rym: This was awesome.

334
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:41,710
Rym: This was crap.

335
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:43,806
Rym: Or we have, well, this is only 13 cents.

336
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:45,650
Rym: Yes, it's only 80.

337
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:56,993
Scott: The only the the main thing in favor of doing box to be is it helps people purchase things because the way the comic market works, you really have to buy things sort of in advance.

338
00:16:57,014 --> 00:17:02,148
Scott: So like know what's coming out or else you're going to miss out on a lot of things and there's nothing you can do about it.

339
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:11,253
Rym: Yeah, but luckily, a lot of those like the things that are really great, usually you'll be able to get usually, but not all the time, which is what said, yeah, not all the time, but better.

340
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:12,118
Rym: You have better odds.

341
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:18,148
Scott: if it's like that Skydoll, even though it's published by Marvel, most comic shops won't have that and there'll be no way to get it.

342
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:18,694
Scott: Yeah.

343
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:19,789
Rym: You might be able to find it, though.

344
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:20,432
Scott: Maybe.

345
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,170
Scott: Maybe if you live in like Manhattan, you'll probably be able to find it.

346
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,493
Scott: But like that give you that Dragon's Den might have it because they're kind of a cool comic shop.

347
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:29,790
Scott: But average comic shop, no way.

348
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:34,870
Scott: You're never going to see that book in your life, you know, and a lot of the trade paperbacks you'll be able to get an Amazon.

349
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,530
Scott: But, you know, some of the weirder ones, you know, maybe not like Rabbi Harvey.

350
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:41,488
Scott: Good luck finding that.

351
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,350
Rym: But anyway, I got it real quick.

352
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:51,739
Rym: I just want to point out that the a trailer was posted for Studio 4C's Genius Party Beyond, which is kind of like.

353
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:53,610
Scott: I didn't even see Genius Party.

354
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,114
Rym: Genius Party Beyond apparently includes things that were weren't in Genius Party but were made for it.

355
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,122
Rym: And the trailer.

356
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:04,299
Scott: basically they made too much and they couldn't fit it all in the trailer.

357
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,630
Rym: Looks pretty bad ass.

358
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,050
Rym: I'm going to wait until it actually comes out.

359
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,670
Rym: We'll probably do all the show on just Genius Party as a unit, both of them at once.

360
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:11,233
Scott: All right.

361
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:11,677
Scott: But we got it.

362
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,889
Scott: Haven't you seen the first one?

363
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:18,560
Rym: But in much more pressing news, originally, Scott and I were not going to be attending the New York Comic-Con.

364
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:19,249
Rym: We had too much to do.

365
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,970
Rym: But I on a lark applied for a press pass because there's a lot of industry people there.

366
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,650
Rym: I kind of want to talk to you and there's a lot of industry events there.

367
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,637
Rym: I kind of want to cover.

368
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:29,370
Rym: And we were given press passes.

369
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,912
Rym: All right.

370
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:32,488
Rym: And then, you know, we have our friends at Tokyo FM.

371
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:35,849
Rym: I mean, we were interviewed for Japanese radio a while ago.

372
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:41,510
Rym: And there's a tiny blurb about us along with our picture in their little magazine.

373
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:49,115
Rym: But they are going to be interviewing TM Revolution pretty much twice at the New York Comic-Con.

374
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,709
Rym: First at the New York Comic-Con.

375
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,169
Rym: I think Brian Nishi, who was kind of awesome in his own right.

376
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,570
Rym: We actually met the dude and we'll talk about him another time.

377
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,223
Rym: But he's he's pretty cool.

378
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:58,667
Rym: I'll say that.

379
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:05,272
Rym: But basically, there's going to be kind of an interview with them and a panel at the convention.

380
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:11,555
Rym: But more importantly, after the convention on Sunday at Kinokuniya Bookstore, we're going to.

381
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:14,110
Scott: Is it still sort of during the convention hours?

382
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,010
Rym: Technically, I didn't even look at what the convention hours are.

383
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:19,750
Rym: It's like near the end of the day on Sunday.

384
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:20,212
Rym: Yeah.

385
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:26,629
Scott: There is going to be like if you went to the convention for more than just Sunday, you're not going to need to be there at that time.

386
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:30,690
Rym: But because it's not in the convention, if you're in Manhattan, you can just drop by.

387
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:40,551
Rym: But at Kinokuniya, TMR is going to be there and we're going to be taking part in a somewhat interesting sounding, I mean, awesomely interesting sounding interview with him.

388
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:40,995
Rym: All right.

389
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,570
Scott: I'm looking at the convention schedule.

390
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,730
Scott: The last event on Sunday ends at a quarter to five.

391
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:50,590
Scott: And that's the most of the events, though, end at like four.

392
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,292
Rym: Yeah.

393
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:53,850
Rym: So we're going to have the exact schedule with all this.

394
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,970
Rym: But stay tuned for the news with us and TMR.

395
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,793
Rym: Now, actually, there was an interview posted with TMR from the kind of the pre New York Comic-Con.

396
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:08,568
Rym: So we're going to make sure we don't ask any of the questions that were already asked in that one.

397
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:09,197
Scott: Yeah.

398
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:09,605
Scott: Yeah.

399
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:13,612
Scott: I don't know exactly how many questions we're going to ask, but, you know, we'll add some.

400
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:14,990
Rym: Yeah, we're still working out the details.

401
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:16,410
Rym: That's why I'm being kind of cagey about it.

402
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,049
Rym: But we'll have some exact schedules for you.

403
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:23,370
Rym: And as a result, too, we're going to be at the New York Comic-Con in some capacity, pretty much all three days.

404
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,891
Rym: But if you want to see us, email us or let us know, because we won't have a table or anything.

405
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:31,990
Rym: We're actually going to be interviewing people and doing press stuff.

406
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,310
Scott: Yeah.

407
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:39,710
Scott: Mostly I'm going to be just walking around sort of networking, trying to get interviews, maybe videos, photos, you know, with the new camera stuff.

408
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,329
Rym: I've been posting in the forum talking to people I know as I get tentative approval for the interviews I plan to do.

409
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:52,908
Rym: So if you're interested in, say, the creators of Avatar and maybe I'm thinking about trying to get an interview with Neil Adams.

410
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:54,540
Scott: That's going to be fun.

411
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,510
Rym: That would be interesting.

412
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,009
Rym: I'll ask him mostly about Batman, I guess.

413
00:20:58,451 --> 00:20:58,755
Scott: Yeah.

414
00:20:59,059 --> 00:20:59,828
Rym: And not other things.

415
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:11,735
Rym: But yeah, we're going to be there in a kind of press capacity, which is going to be weird because usually we're primarily entertainers or guests and then kind of secondarily to that we're press.

416
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:13,509
Rym: But this time we're just press.

417
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:15,147
Rym: All we're doing is covering it.

418
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:15,513
Scott: Yeah.

419
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,329
Scott: So you got to take off.

420
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,190
Scott: We got to stop trying to be Penny Arcade and try to be like Engadget instead.

421
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:20,694
Scott: Yeah.

422
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:22,310
Rym: So if I go to a panel, I can't clap.

423
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,769
Rym: I have to sit there and be objective.

424
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:24,434
Scott: Yep.

425
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:25,628
Scott: That's how it's got to be.

426
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,345
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, we're trying to move along a little bit because I'm a little tired.

427
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:37,159
Rym: I got a lot of work to do.

428
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,680
Rym: Katsu's over and I kind of want to get some pizza or something.

429
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:43,400
Rym: But, you know, my theme week is continuing.

430
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:45,079
Rym: It is those were the days a week.

431
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,780
Rym: My things of the day are all related and that they all relate to the classic song Those Were the Days.

432
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,724
Scott: Hey, everyone, when you make your Scott's Box comments, tell me if you like Rims Theme Week.

433
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:56,100
Scott: I haven't seen a single feedback.

434
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:58,340
Rym: About Rims Theme Week, because I haven't really asked for it.

435
00:21:58,581 --> 00:22:01,200
Rym: It seems like no one ever sends us feedback unless we ask.

436
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:09,060
Scott: The reason for that is because like other podcasts, like when they play people's voicemails on the show and they read emails on the show.

437
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,319
Scott: And that really people love it when their emails are read on the show.

438
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,920
Rym: But the thing is, I found that I don't like listening to other people's emails.

439
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,802
Scott: Exactly.

440
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:28,900
Scott: But people love even if it's like not their email, like if they sent in an email and you start reading email, even if you never read their email, they'll sit there and suspense like hoping that you read their email the whole time.

441
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,600
Scott: And if you actually do, they'd be like, but it's weird.

442
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,500
Rym: Like I asked for feedback on the ITCS and I got two sets of responses.

443
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:40,900
Rym: One set said, yeah, it's way over my head and super boring.

444
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:41,543
Rym: Stop it.

445
00:22:42,006 --> 00:22:44,660
Rym: And the other half were it's way too shallow.

446
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:46,039
Rym: You need to be a lot more technical.

447
00:22:46,342 --> 00:22:46,585
Scott: Yes.

448
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:47,659
Scott: I don't know what to do about that.

449
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,061
Scott: Yeah.

450
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:51,416
Rym: The thing is, the one guy was like, I'm really into CS and

451
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:51,797
Rym: I.T.,

452
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:52,842
Rym: but I find them boring.

453
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:57,999
Scott: So I'm curious how the thing is, people keep asking the same questions about like college and what major to go to.

454
00:22:58,341 --> 00:23:03,363
Rym: And they keep asking questions to like they want shows like how do you set up an Apache server?

455
00:23:03,443 --> 00:23:06,780
Scott: That's more will make those things as videos, not as podcasts.

456
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,201
Rym: Yeah.

457
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:07,543
Rym: Let's see.

458
00:23:07,884 --> 00:23:10,798
Rym: First, you type app to get install space Apache.

459
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:11,741
Scott: Yeah.

460
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:13,320
Scott: Those are things Google can tell you.

461
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:13,824
Scott: All right.

462
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,420
Scott: But anyway, enough about that.

463
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,800
Scott: The point is, is that if we did we read emails and put feedback in the show, that would encourage more feedback.

464
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:23,620
Rym: But yet none of you want to hear the feedback.

465
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,118
Rym: So we're not going to do that.

466
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:25,620
Rym: Yeah.

467
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:31,343
Rym: So, you know, your motive is if you want GeekNights to be better for you, tell us what you want.

468
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:35,469
Rym: If you tell us something and no one else does, we'll probably do what you want.

469
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:35,960
Scott: Yeah.

470
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,743
Scott: I mean, think about it.

471
00:23:36,824 --> 00:23:48,725
Scott: If you're the only one who sends in a feedback, let's say only one person emails me about Scott's box, you know, even though enough people have already said you should only talk about Superman comics that you buy through the box, then guess what's going to happen?

472
00:23:48,745 --> 00:23:52,240
Rym: Scott's not going to talk about the box anymore because he's probably never going to buy a Superman comic.

473
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,940
Scott: And I buy a Superman comic like once a year.

474
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,462
Scott: Maybe.

475
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:58,300
Rym: What was the last Superman comic you bought or read?

476
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:02,818
Scott: I bought that crisis in Infinite Earths, which has Superman in it.

477
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,920
Scott: Wait, I bought that Green Lantern.

478
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:09,060
Rym: God, that Green Lantern was one of the dumber things I've ever read.

479
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:10,290
Scott: It was pretty dumb.

480
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,099
Scott: It wasn't.

481
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,739
Scott: But I've read some really dumb things.

482
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:15,819
Rym: So I think that's the line because I actually read it.

483
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,479
Rym: But what was that other thing you gave me?

484
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:18,798
Rym: Shazam or something?

485
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,060
Scott: Shazam or Captain Marvel, the life and death of Captain Marvel.

486
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,699
Rym: Yeah, I couldn't even get through that.

487
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,221
Scott: You should.

488
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:28,159
Scott: Mostly the good part is the graphic novel at the end.

489
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,699
Rym: Yeah, but without context, that didn't do anything for me.

490
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,387
Scott: No, not really.

491
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:32,380
Scott: Because, yeah, anyway.

492
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,940
Rym: Anyway, so this is the second time I've done a theme.

493
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,545
Rym: We like this before I did.

494
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:42,005
Rym: the Hitler was born to be alive, boring, which actually got a lot of feedback.

495
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:43,419
Rym: People seem to really like that one.

496
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:44,998
Rym: But here we go.

497
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:47,739
Rym: This is a cover of the song.

498
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:52,480
Rym: Those were the days as performed by the Hermes House Band.

499
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,120
Scott: Does that have anything to do with the...

500
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,680
Rym: Hey, man, it is Hermes.

501
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,899
Rym: No, the Limbo Wing Futurama character?

502
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,543
Rym: Nothing at all.

503
00:24:58,564 --> 00:24:59,920
Scott: Does it have anything to do with the God?

504
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,600
Rym: No, the Hermes House Band runs really fast.

505
00:25:02,942 --> 00:25:03,940
Rym: I really like them.

506
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,220
Rym: They are a college band, like formed by a bunch of friends.

507
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:20,340
Rym: They're Dutch and they pretty much for as far as I've ever seen, just cover popular good songs in a pretty straightforward, similar way to the way they cover everything.

508
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,400
Rym: And pursuant to that, they make music videos.

509
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,339
Rym: Their music videos are just fun is the only way I can describe it.

510
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:35,800
Rym: And the one I'm looking to in particular for those were the days is very, I don't know, Moulin Rouge in terms of the way it's kind of put together.

511
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:38,820
Rym: And I don't know, I'm a sucker for that kind of work and that kind of thing.

512
00:25:39,143 --> 00:25:40,139
Rym: I like the Hermes House Band.

513
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,198
Rym: I like this music video.

514
00:25:41,903 --> 00:25:43,579
Rym: I like this song and I think it's cool.

515
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,100
Rym: Of course, this is only the penultimate.

516
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,597
Rym: Those were the days because tomorrow you will get the epicness, the ultimate.

517
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:52,839
Rym: pretty much tomorrow is the reason I did this week.

518
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,622
Scott: Yeah.

519
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:55,080
Scott: Ultimate follows penultimate.

520
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:58,619
Scott: So, Rym, how do you feel about X-Men's?

521
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:05,580
Rym: The only X-Men I ever enjoyed ever was the cartoon and kind of the crappy board game.

522
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:07,240
Scott: And I have sent you a link to an image.

523
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,298
Scott: Don't click on it quite yet.

524
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:09,001
Rym: OK.

525
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,440
Scott: And Rym hasn't seen this image.

526
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:21,340
Scott: This is an image that was made by some graphic designer guy in California named Eric Tan, or at least his blog says his name is Eric Tan.

527
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,320
Scott: Now, I sent Rym the link to the image.

528
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,760
Scott: I'm actually for the thing of the day.

529
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,159
Scott: I'm going to link to the blog post.

530
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:27,547
Scott: This is an image.

531
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:29,320
Scott: I think he was paid to make this.

532
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,639
Scott: Now, look at that image.

533
00:26:31,921 --> 00:26:32,446
Scott: Look at it.

534
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:33,980
Rym: OK, I can look at it now.

535
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,830
Scott: Yeah, you can look at it.

536
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:35,560
Rym: All right.

537
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:43,700
Rym: If the X-Men looked like that, I would be a fan of the X-Men like you could never imagine.

538
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,180
Scott: That is the greatest X-Men image I have seen that is up there in my entire life.

539
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,500
Rym: That is right there with the representation of Superman in Batman The Dark Knight Returns.

540
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,460
Scott: Oh, I think it's better.

541
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,299
Rym: That is that is so exactly what the X-Men should be.

542
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,368
Scott: That is the it every.

543
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:04,100
Scott: there should be one Marvel comic called X-Men.

544
00:27:04,402 --> 00:27:07,040
Scott: All other X comics should be disintegrated and canceled.

545
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,560
Scott: And it should look like this drawn by Eric Tan.

546
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,361
Scott: Right.

547
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,700
Rym: And I want a poster of this.

548
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:19,420
Rym: I want this to be a poster like all the comments on the thread are like, OMG, make prints.

549
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:20,830
Scott: OMG, make prints.

550
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:21,660
Scott: I'll give you money.

551
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,880
Rym: I would get like a door size poster.

552
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,111
Scott: I want this poster.

553
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:25,840
Scott: frowny face.

554
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:27,310
Scott: Are you still sleeping?

555
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,016
Scott: Question mark.

556
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:30,451
Scott: This is a great poster.

557
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:31,740
Scott: How can I purchase one?

558
00:27:32,262 --> 00:27:36,600
Scott: This is like the greatest image of X-Men I've seen in my entire life.

559
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,298
Scott: And I want it.

560
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,585
Scott: Oh, my God.

561
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:41,320
Rym: That's a pretty good thing of the day.

562
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:42,148
Scott: Yeah, I know.

563
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,390
Scott: Right.

564
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,139
Scott: It's just a picture.

565
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,699
Scott: I always feel bad using just a picture as a thing of the day.

566
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,339
Scott: But when it's a picture, this great.

567
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,704
Scott: There's no way.

568
00:27:49,804 --> 00:27:55,160
Rym: I think the best part of it, aside from the sentinels lined up in the background in that awesome, awesome way.

569
00:27:55,902 --> 00:28:02,320
Rym: And every other part of it is the slanty shoulders on my man in the front on the beast.

570
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:02,762
Rym: Yes.

571
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:03,532
Scott: Yeah, I like.

572
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:04,180
Rym: I like shoulders.

573
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:04,542
Rym: Do it.

574
00:28:04,623 --> 00:28:06,159
Scott: I like the slanty shoulders on the beast.

575
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:06,722
Scott: Right.

576
00:28:06,842 --> 00:28:14,669
Scott: I like the like the Iceman making a swoosh, but the angel making a straight line through the swoosh and they form an X. Yeah.

577
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:15,139
Scott: Yep.

578
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:18,379
Scott: And then you got the giant Cyclops head on the right.

579
00:28:19,182 --> 00:28:19,889
Scott: That's good stuff.

580
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:20,999
Rym: Oh, man.

581
00:28:21,603 --> 00:28:25,060
Scott: You got the Kirby Crackle on Jean Grey's hand.

582
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,260
Scott: You got the little lightnings coming from Storm.

583
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,498
Scott: It's it's all good.

584
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:29,622
Rym: All right.

585
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:37,180
Rym: But anyway, we had trouble coming up with the show to do tonight, partly because I've watched a ton of anime and Scott hasn't watched any.

586
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,217
Rym: But yet Scott's read some comics and I haven't read any.

587
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,400
Scott: Meanwhile, we did anime the past two weeks.

588
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,369
Scott: It's comics time.

589
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,460
Scott: I'm ahead now.

590
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,598
Rym: So what comic should I read?

591
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:50,560
Rym: I think more of our listeners are anime fans than comic fans by far.

592
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:51,444
Scott: Yeah, I know.

593
00:28:51,465 --> 00:29:02,759
Rym: If I gave you that fell comic, because I've noticed whenever we talk about anime, a lot of people like, oh, my God, whenever we talk about comics, a few usually the same people go, oh, my God, are you saying we should get rid of the comics?

594
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:08,020
Rym: No, I'm just curious if you people, you know, a lot of response on Scott's box.

595
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:09,045
Rym: Yeah, you did.

596
00:29:09,106 --> 00:29:11,039
Rym: But there's also manga and stuff in there.

597
00:29:11,362 --> 00:29:11,584
Scott: Oh, yeah.

598
00:29:11,604 --> 00:29:12,413
Scott: We should do a manga.

599
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:13,020
Scott: That's you're right.

600
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,299
Scott: We haven't done a manga in a while.

601
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,839
Rym: So, yeah, but I haven't read any manga.

602
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:17,319
Scott: I'll give you a manga to read.

603
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:18,391
Rym: I don't have time for that.

604
00:29:18,411 --> 00:29:19,220
Rym: I'm watching Avatar.

605
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:23,078
Rym: Well, and and Bakano and Kazu no Yojimbo.

606
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,468
Scott: Well, what are you going to do?

607
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:25,659
Rym: Watch those shows.

608
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:30,897
Rym: Speaking of which, you should finish watching Kazu no Yojimbo so I can get the second goddamn DVD of it.

609
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:33,567
Scott: What do you mean?

610
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:34,093
Rym: what's my hurry?

611
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:34,700
Rym: That is my hurry.

612
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,289
Rym: I want to see it.

613
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:35,899
Rym: I like that show.

614
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:37,840
Scott: I'm not big on the watching lately.

615
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,623
Scott: I'm big on the reading.

616
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:42,220
Scott: And also, you know, I've been doing more coding lately.

617
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:51,700
Scott: And, you know, I mean, coding, if I'm making software that can consume absolutely all of my free time, if I desire it, I could put absolutely everything on hold.

618
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,039
Rym: Don't forget, we've also got the camera now.

619
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:54,801
Scott: I know.

620
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:55,223
Scott: Right.

621
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:59,243
Scott: But until I get a newer computer, that's and I get to edit any videos.

622
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:01,860
Rym: So this will probably be short because there's not a lot to say.

623
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,502
Scott: But, well, I think there is quite a bit to say, but I don't think we have time to say it all.

624
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,105
Scott: Yeah.

625
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:08,580
Scott: Or nor do we have the research and knowledge to back it up.

626
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,840
Rym: We'll try to talk about this again.

627
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,612
Rym: But this will be kind of the first show of a someday to be completed series on newspaper comics.

628
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:17,839
Rym: Now, we'll do another show on this.

629
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,545
Rym: I'm almost sure.

630
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,460
Scott: Basically, the deal is, right?

631
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,020
Scott: News comics in the newspaper are way older than comic books.

632
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:31,320
Scott: I mean, you open up your like, you know, social studies textbook and they got political cartoons about Teddy Roosevelt in there.

633
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,859
Scott: You know, that's a newspaper comic right there.

634
00:30:34,203 --> 00:30:35,519
Rym: Scott, when was the yellow kid?

635
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:40,980
Scott: Anyway, the yellow kid was not until like the after Teddy Roosevelt.

636
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,420
Rym: Because that's widely considered to be the first actual comic.

637
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:47,840
Scott: Well, the yellow kid, first of all, was a newspaper comic.

638
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:49,560
Scott: That's why it was yellow journalism.

639
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:52,616
Scott: But actually, the yellow kid was the first.

640
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:54,284
Scott: It's not it's.

641
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:56,900
Scott: there were comics before the yellow kid.

642
00:30:57,161 --> 00:30:57,423
Scott: Right.

643
00:30:57,846 --> 00:31:00,060
Scott: But they weren't sequential art.

644
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:06,600
Scott: They were like, you know, they might have been a series of pictures, but there wasn't a sequence, you see, but the yellow kid wasn't sequential.

645
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:07,128
Rym: Usually.

646
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:07,230
Rym: Yeah.

647
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,986
Scott: The first there was the first.

648
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:11,540
Scott: the very first yellow kid was sequential art.

649
00:31:11,641 --> 00:31:12,630
Scott: I'll show you later.

650
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,659
Rym: Yeah, but usually it wasn't.

651
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:14,899
Scott: No, it wasn't always.

652
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,500
Scott: No, but the first like comic books were much later.

653
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,940
Scott: We're talking like last century as opposed to two centuries ago.

654
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,193
Scott: I mean, the yellow kid, we're talking like 1890 something.

655
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:29,780
Scott: But it was like a decade or two before you had a comic book.

656
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:37,539
Scott: You know, in the first comic books were just newspaper strips collected together, sort of like when you go to the store and you buy complete Calvin and Hobbes.

657
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:39,509
Scott: That's the first comic books were like.

658
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:44,620
Scott: it took it took even longer than that for them to actually make original like comic books.

659
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,350
Scott: So there was a story meant for the comic book, you know, and such.

660
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:50,383
Scott: so newspaper comics.

661
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:53,580
Scott: strips, you know, have been around for a super long time.

662
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,460
Scott: And even the first web comics were strips as opposed to, you know, big pages.

663
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,760
Scott: You know, there are pages now, you know, webcomics that do it like that.

664
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,940
Scott: But, you know, even most webcomics are just the strip format.

665
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,088
Scott: Penny Arcade is a strip.

666
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:07,480
Scott: Boasis is a strip.

667
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:07,861
Scott: Right.

668
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,520
Scott: So let's talk about them strips.

669
00:32:11,243 --> 00:32:11,645
Scott: All right.

670
00:32:11,665 --> 00:32:13,251
Scott: So are there?

671
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:15,260
Scott: I know pretty much hates most strips.

672
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:20,919
Scott: And, you know, if you're reading the ones that come out today in the newspaper today, there is a very good reason for that.

673
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:27,661
Rym: I haven't seen a newspaper comic worth reading pretty much since I left high school.

674
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:34,260
Rym: And even then, I only read the newspaper comics because that was what I looked at in the morning while I was eating breakfast.

675
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:35,287
Rym: Yeah, I know that.

676
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:36,720
Rym: Even then, I'd read like two of them.

677
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:37,899
Rym: And then the rest were just garbage.

678
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:42,660
Scott: I've read like pretty much if there's ever a newspaper with comics in it.

679
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,041
Scott: Right.

680
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:47,530
Scott: I'll I'll read most of them, but I'll never read like those those like Mary Worth ones.

681
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:48,400
Scott: Those don't get read.

682
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:49,371
Rym: Or Studio 3G.

683
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,091
Scott: Apartment 3G.

684
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:51,759
Rym: Whatever it is.

685
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,805
Scott: I don't know.

686
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,140
Scott: What's the Gill something?

687
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:55,983
Scott: Gill Thorpe.

688
00:32:56,547 --> 00:32:58,238
Rym: And then there's all the you know what?

689
00:32:58,901 --> 00:32:59,685
Rym: Let's get right into it.

690
00:32:59,725 --> 00:33:06,320
Rym: What are there any good comics left in newspapers with the exceptions of those rare newspapers that syndicate something awesome?

691
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,864
Rym: Like there was a newspaper syndicating the Perry Bible Fellowship and Penny Arcade.

692
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:11,025
Scott: Yeah.

693
00:33:11,086 --> 00:33:11,328
Scott: Yeah.

694
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:12,560
Scott: But is anyone diesel?

695
00:33:13,864 --> 00:33:14,084
Scott: What?

696
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:17,296
Scott: I think some people are syndicating Penny Arcade and we're not.

697
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:21,279
Scott: I'm not sure, but I think it was printed somewhere at some time.

698
00:33:22,246 --> 00:33:23,500
Rym: You sure it wasn't nothing?

699
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:24,868
Scott: I'm sure it.

700
00:33:25,895 --> 00:33:26,499
Scott: I'll go check it.

701
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,039
Rym: I'm curious about that.

702
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,139
Scott: I'm pretty sure it was printed somewhere at some time.

703
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,940
Scott: Anyway, of newspaper comic strips that are in the newspaper today.

704
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,059
Scott: If you want to say what's a good one.

705
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:38,821
Scott: Right.

706
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:42,399
Scott: Well, Dilbert is only funny like twice a year.

707
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:48,120
Scott: Dilbert was that still a thousand percent funnier than Garfield.

708
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:50,700
Rym: I'll say straight up that I don't like Dilbert at all.

709
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:57,846
Rym: I mean, I was kind of funny early on, but even then it never held a candle to Calvin and Hobbes.

710
00:33:57,886 --> 00:34:00,220
Scott: No, it did not even like Foxtrot.

711
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:02,980
Scott: Now, Foxtrot is doing Sunday only.

712
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:10,279
Scott: And I think that's actually increasing his funny percentage because he's sort of, you know, putting the full power into each one.

713
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,060
Rym: Well, Foxtrot, I found a lot more funny when I was a lot younger.

714
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,005
Rym: And that's true.

715
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:15,719
Rym: The older I got, the less I enjoyed it.

716
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:21,184
Rym: It's also then again, it's hard to tell if it's because the jokes kind of changed or because I changed.

717
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:25,842
Rym: But Calvin and Hobbes, I could pretty much read forever and never get tired of.

718
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:31,300
Scott: I don't think Foxtrot is actually any better or worse comic wise than any of the other strips in the newspaper.

719
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:36,321
Scott: I think it's only because there is geek references in there that I find it more enjoyable.

720
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:45,580
Rym: I think that the comedic timing in general of Foxtrot was, by and large, far superior to the comedy in any other strip in there for the most part.

721
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,299
Rym: It was actually a better strip.

722
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,299
Rym: There are some strips, some old ones that I would laugh at.

723
00:34:51,543 --> 00:34:55,139
Scott: Some of them, but not a significant percentage more.

724
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,920
Rym: I mean, look at like Garfield.

725
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,419
Rym: We've talked enough about Garfield.

726
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:03,480
Scott: It's funnier when it's randomized than when it's funnier if you remove Garfield.

727
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,080
Rym: Removed Garfield from Garfield is like one of my favorite comic strips now.

728
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:14,565
Scott: But I mean, it's basically it's weird because like I can sort of categorize the newspaper strips.

729
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,620
Scott: It's like the never read ones.

730
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:17,734
Scott: I won't even look at them.

731
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:18,160
Scott: Right.

732
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,060
Rym: That's like the Mary Worth and all that.

733
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:20,744
Scott: Exactly.

734
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:21,459
Rym: Or the Kathy.

735
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,019
Scott: There's the read and don't laugh.

736
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,776
Rym: That's like a Wizard of Id.

737
00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:30,960
Scott: I usually read those because there's a few words, but I like Wizard of Id just because it's a wizard, but it's not funny.

738
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:38,179
Scott: It's always the king is short or the king is corrupt or the wizard is lame or Sir Rodney is lame.

739
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,989
Rym: And then there's the equally unfunny

740
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:40,653
Rym: B.C.,

741
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:41,780
Rym: which also has sold the guy.

742
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,897
Scott: That one's done right.

743
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:44,495
Rym: It was in there.

744
00:35:44,717 --> 00:35:44,920
Rym: Yes.

745
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,106
Rym: I'm just talking general.

746
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:48,339
Rym: We need to talk about what's in the papers right now.

747
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,300
Scott: Yeah, especially since we haven't had a newspaper in this house ever.

748
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:51,983
Rym: I think the last time.

749
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:59,516
Rym: I mean, the only reason I even saw some modern comics at all is when I worked in Yonkers, sometimes I go to a pizza shop and sometimes it'd be a newspaper.

750
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:06,000
Scott: You know, when I go to my parents' house, they get the newspaper and there's a page of comics that I usually read when I'm sitting at the kitchen table.

751
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:10,780
Rym: But I mean, like Kathy, I just find that comic offensive to all of the senses.

752
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:17,880
Scott: Kathy is so offensive to every sense, especially the eyes, because there's so many fucking words and I can't read.

753
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,784
Scott: It's just painful.

754
00:36:18,904 --> 00:36:20,814
Rym: Never mind the art or the fact that the jokes.

755
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:28,779
Rym: not only are the jokes not funny, but they're so like stereotypical of everything about certain kinds of American culture that I hate.

756
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:29,202
Rym: Yep.

757
00:36:29,483 --> 00:36:34,520
Scott: I mean, and then there's Luanne, at least I don't know what Luanne is, but at least Garfield, as bad as it is.

758
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:34,821
Scott: Right.

759
00:36:34,841 --> 00:36:44,960
Scott: If you look at the earliest Garfield and the newest Garfield, there has been an improvement in the artistic skills and an application of computer technology.

760
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:47,240
Scott: Kathy is the same art.

761
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,260
Scott: It's always been with no change whatsoever.

762
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,499
Rym: It's also awful.

763
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:51,163
Scott: Yeah.

764
00:36:51,424 --> 00:36:56,083
Rym: I mean, it's reminiscent of that bulging bride's thing with those god awful advertisements.

765
00:36:56,124 --> 00:37:00,731
Scott: I have to see every goddamn day walking into those for the ads in Grand Central are pretty bad.

766
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:01,520
Scott: Frightening.

767
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,207
Scott: I was happy with the the watch over your bank ones with the candidates in the shield, even though they're totally lame.

768
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:08,920
Scott: Yeah, they were lame, but at least it was better.

769
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,959
Rym: At least they're not offensive to my senses.

770
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,382
Rym: Yeah.

771
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:14,140
Scott: But no, it's weird because a lot of newspaper comics.

772
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:14,843
Scott: Right.

773
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:16,880
Scott: They actually come from greeting cards.

774
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,842
Scott: I mean, they turn remember that cranky old lady that was on all the greeting cards for a long time.

775
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:24,160
Scott: They turned her into like a one panel far side style comic.

776
00:37:24,662 --> 00:37:24,904
Rym: Right.

777
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:26,640
Rym: Are you sure she wasn't a comic first?

778
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:28,680
Scott: I'm pretty sure she wasn't a comic.

779
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,819
Rym: I remember seeing that comic for a long time.

780
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,301
Scott: Right.

781
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:36,588
Scott: Care Bears Care Bears were never a comic strip, but they were a a greeting card first.

782
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:37,120
Scott: Oh, man.

783
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:38,480
Rym: We got to watch the Care Bears movie.

784
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:40,720
Rym: I totally got to do a show on that.

785
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,687
Rym: That movie's awesome.

786
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,500
Scott: Not Zippy the Pinhead.

787
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,080
Scott: The other guy Zippy the Pinhead is terrible.

788
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:52,060
Scott: So not at least it's it tries to be artistically high brow.

789
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:52,744
Scott: I'll give it that.

790
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:54,840
Rym: But it ends up being pretentious and weird.

791
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,585
Scott: Exactly.

792
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,879
Scott: No, what's the other one?

793
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,580
Scott: Ziggy Ziggy is the one that I think also started as a greeting card.

794
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:02,705
Rym: I don't like Ziggy.

795
00:38:02,745 --> 00:38:06,599
Scott: I'm not sure if Kathy was a greeting card first or not, but she's on a lot of greeting cards.

796
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:08,546
Scott: Yeah.

797
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:08,971
Scott: Yeah.

798
00:38:09,011 --> 00:38:09,820
Scott: Greeting card comics.

799
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,446
Scott: Not cool.

800
00:38:10,669 --> 00:38:11,460
Rym: So I don't know.

801
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:16,419
Rym: We could either talk about why we think comics are bad in the newspaper or we could just talk about the ones we thought were good.

802
00:38:16,582 --> 00:38:17,960
Scott: OK, so ones we thought were good.

803
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,464
Scott: Check this out.

804
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:19,980
Rym: Calvin and Hobbes far and away.

805
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,239
Rym: That's like the best comic ever.

806
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,100
Scott: Calvin and Hobbes is closely tied with the far side.

807
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,223
Rym: The far side.

808
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:29,719
Rym: Like I look back at the far side and it's not funny to me.

809
00:38:31,362 --> 00:38:32,780
Rym: Any any more.

810
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:36,940
Rym: But remember, on one hand, I've pretty much memorized the far side.

811
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,159
Scott: I know that's always a problem.

812
00:38:38,602 --> 00:38:40,300
Rym: I look at one and I don't go, ha ha.

813
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:41,640
Rym: I go, I remember that one.

814
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:45,701
Scott: Actually, you can read Calvin and Hobbes online still and they just sort of cycle through them.

815
00:38:46,163 --> 00:38:50,680
Scott: And today it is a funny one with an Astro Boy joke that I didn't remember.

816
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:51,864
Rym: It's weird.

817
00:38:51,904 --> 00:39:00,180
Rym: A lot of these the good comics, like I look back and if I look at like the first panel of any given Calvin and Hobbes, I remember that entire strip like perfectly.

818
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:00,501
Rym: Yep.

819
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:03,620
Scott: There is a string of peanuts.

820
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,728
Scott: That's actually good.

821
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:06,400
Scott: I mean, the old peanuts.

822
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:12,560
Scott: The thing is, like I respect Charles Schultz and everything, you know, but like only some peanuts are actually funny.

823
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:21,340
Scott: Usually the funny ones involve either a try to kick the football and missing, but it's only funny the first time or usually Woodstock playing hockey.

824
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,300
Scott: That's Woodstock playing ice hockey in the birdbath with the Zamboni is funny every time.

825
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,971
Rym: I almost feel like peanuts was.

826
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:30,337
Rym: it's not really good.

827
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,420
Scott: And even like it can also be funny.

828
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,620
Scott: Snoopy the Air Baron with the typewriter.

829
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:36,784
Rym: But he was a kid like.

830
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:40,519
Rym: I never really enjoyed it, but it seems like a lot of people.

831
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,740
Scott: there's a lot of the cartoons like the special.

832
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,700
Rym: Yes, that's totally separate.

833
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:52,460
Rym: Yeah, there's a lot of like cultural cachet with peanuts and a lot of people like respect peanuts and feel like peanuts is something that you have to like.

834
00:39:52,600 --> 00:40:04,587
Scott: It's like it's like an Americana kind of feeling, you know, it's like it's like you look at it and you smile and you identify with it and you might feel good, but you don't laugh because there's no real funny joke.

835
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:09,739
Scott: most of the time, you know, or the joke is so has such a broad appeal, there's not much of a joke.

836
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,560
Rym: But the far side when I was a kid, because far side kind of started because now there's a million ripoff far sides.

837
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,959
Scott: Some of them some of the ripoff far sides are actually kind of OK.

838
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,397
Rym: The ones in the newspaper aren't.

839
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,339
Scott: Well, I saw one that was funny a couple of times.

840
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:26,139
Rym: You know, I haven't seen one that was good.

841
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:26,581
Scott: All right.

842
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:31,260
Rym: Well, but the far side kind of started that trend of the weird comics.

843
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:31,983
Scott: Yep.

844
00:40:32,285 --> 00:40:34,240
Rym: And it was super funny for the time.

845
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,155
Rym: And I think the best thing about the far side was I bought one of the.

846
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,160
Rym: I bought all the books.

847
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:46,544
Rym: But I remember one of the books randomly, I decided to look in the index and it listed all the letters, but there's nothing under them like what I'm flipping through and flipping through.

848
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:47,739
Rym: They get to tea.

849
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:51,040
Rym: And the first one is the one about the albatross.

850
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:56,060
Rym: And every single comic is listed under tea as the one about the something.

851
00:40:57,061 --> 00:41:00,793
Rym: And that was funnier than my favorite.

852
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:09,104
Scott: far sides are usually the ones with amoebas involved or the one where the kid is trying to push open the pull door to the gifted school.

853
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:12,360
Rym: Yes, I was one of the many people who had a poster of that when I was younger.

854
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,102
Scott: That's a good one.

855
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:17,660
Rym: Also, our side gets mad points for stopping when he ran out of ideas.

856
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:18,206
Rym: Yeah.

857
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:19,199
Scott: Super points for that.

858
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:20,144
Rym: Of course.

859
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:22,779
Scott: Calvin and Hobbes gets negative points for doing the same thing.

860
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:29,644
Rym: Calvin and Hobbes gets points for being probably the greatest newspaper comic ever written, bar none.

861
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:34,100
Rym: Probably I defy anyone to bring up a newspaper comic that's better.

862
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,939
Scott: But minus points for being a recluse.

863
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:39,720
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time points because now there's that mystery.

864
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,586
Scott: I know.

865
00:41:40,607 --> 00:41:40,995
Scott: I know.

866
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:41,240
Scott: Right.

867
00:41:41,762 --> 00:41:43,131
Rym: It's it's plus it never.

868
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:44,540
Rym: the comic was just perfect.

869
00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:47,759
Rym: And then it ended on this high note.

870
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:48,903
Scott: Yep.

871
00:41:49,265 --> 00:41:51,740
Rym: Kind of like out not Outland.

872
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,804
Rym: Outland was awful.

873
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:58,080
Rym: But Bloom County, Bloom County is my other than Calvin and Hobbes, like my favorite newspaper comic ever.

874
00:41:58,221 --> 00:41:59,540
Scott: And I don't think I ever read that really.

875
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,880
Rym: Bloom County, you know, with Opus the penguin and all those things.

876
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:08,039
Rym: I know the penguin that that comic, maybe just because I was a kid and I had all the books and my parents really liked it.

877
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,836
Scott: But it's more like a platypus than a penguin.

878
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,920
Rym: Actually, he's more like a puffin than a penguin.

879
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,400
Scott: He's like a platy- platyguin.

880
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,139
Rym: He's not anything like a platypus.

881
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,579
Scott: Well, he's got the platypus like Bill.

882
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:18,862
Rym: No.

883
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:20,720
Rym: Well, Scott, what does the platypus look like?

884
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:21,778
Rym: He's more like a puffin.

885
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:23,398
Scott: I don't know what a puffin is.

886
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,580
Rym: Look up a puffin and then look up a platypus.

887
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,960
Rym: He's not anything like a platypus.

888
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,460
Scott: He's got the bill of the platypus.

889
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,085
Rym: No, he doesn't.

890
00:42:30,227 --> 00:42:31,459
Rym: A platypus has a duck bill.

891
00:42:31,981 --> 00:42:32,304
Scott: Hold on.

892
00:42:32,365 --> 00:42:33,779
Scott: I'm going to go to images like Google.

893
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,919
Scott: What the hell is wrong with you?

894
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,979
Scott: And look for Opus to see a picture of Opus.

895
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,200
Rym: Opus does not look anything like a platypus.

896
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,300
Rym: In fact, early Opus did look like a penguin.

897
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,446
Rym: He changed a lot.

898
00:42:43,466 --> 00:42:45,139
Rym: He looked more like a puffin as time went on.

899
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:46,919
Rym: He never looked like a platypus.

900
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:47,923
Rym: But anyway.

901
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:50,640
Scott: He's got a giant platypus bill.

902
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,819
Rym: That's not what it look of a platypus.

903
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:55,080
Rym: That's not what platypuses look like at all.

904
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:55,831
Rym: Seriously.

905
00:42:56,302 --> 00:42:59,620
Scott: He doesn't look like a platypus, but his bill is like a platypus bill.

906
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,469
Rym: How so?

907
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,179
Scott: It's big.

908
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,140
Rym: Platypus bills are mostly flat and wide.

909
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,558
Scott: This looks flat and wide to me.

910
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:08,579
Rym: What picture are you looking at?

911
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,200
Scott: This one where he's reading a book.

912
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,760
Rym: OK, there's a slight cut there.

913
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,080
Rym: Well, I tried to show Scott that platypus bills are small and flat.

914
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:18,519
Scott: They're big and flat.

915
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,380
Scott: And Opus looks big and flat.

916
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,378
Scott: It looks nothing like a puffin or penguin bill.

917
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,898
Rym: Compare the relative sizes of the heads.

918
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:26,371
Scott: Yeah.

919
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:27,400
Rym: And you'll see.

920
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,539
Scott: I'll not disagree that his body is penguin and puffin-ish.

921
00:43:32,801 --> 00:43:33,638
Rym: One, he is a penguin.

922
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:34,788
Rym: Two, it's it's.

923
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,099
Rym: it's more like a puffin.

924
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,560
Scott: Anyway, I can't believe why is it looks like a platypus.

925
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,400
Scott: Let's not let this episode disintegrate.

926
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,274
Rym: The comic was all about 80s politics.

927
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:49,180
Rym: And as a result, I know a lot about 80s politics, mostly from reading Bloom County.

928
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,398
Scott: Maybe because I didn't read it.

929
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,420
Scott: I know almost nothing about 80s politics.

930
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,440
Rym: You don't know anything about 90s politics.

931
00:43:54,521 --> 00:43:54,989
Rym: Or 2000s politics.

932
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,344
Scott: That's right.

933
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:57,978
Scott: I got better things to think about.

934
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:00,855
Rym: And I think anyway, what else are we going to talk about?

935
00:44:00,896 --> 00:44:01,600
Rym: newspaper comics?

936
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,060
Rym: They're almost all inoffensive and non funny.

937
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:10,280
Rym: Well, actually, that's the one thing I wanted to bring up is I feel like we should do a separate show on that because we've already gone on long enough.

938
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:15,483
Scott: I just want to bring up the point real quick is that I've been buying a lot of super old comic strips.

939
00:44:15,523 --> 00:44:20,180
Scott: I'm buying like the Dick Tracy's from like the 30s and the 20s and whatnot.

940
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:25,439
Scott: And I forget what year it is, but and I've been I think I'm going to buy the Flash Gordon's from way back in the day.

941
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,522
Scott: Right.

942
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:34,758
Scott: And the old comic strips from way back on that are super awesome and super better than the ones we have now.

943
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,205
Scott: Like, go read.

944
00:44:36,386 --> 00:44:39,360
Scott: you can buy the original Dick Tracy and these big hardcovers.

945
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,380
Scott: It is so kick ass.

946
00:44:41,661 --> 00:44:42,524
Scott: Oh, my God.

947
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:46,700
Scott: And it's really sad that they don't exist anymore in that style.

948
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,536
Rym: Yeah, but just newspaper comics in general are not even like.

949
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:54,888
Rym: I feel like the medium as a whole is just worthless at this point.

950
00:44:55,049 --> 00:45:01,720
Scott: because I mean that because anyone who's actually going to do something like quality, it's very hard to break into the newspaper.

951
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:02,322
Scott: Right.

952
00:45:02,623 --> 00:45:06,864
Scott: So they just sort of take that art and they go online where they can do what they want.

953
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:07,999
Scott: And, you know, they're not limited.

954
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:12,040
Scott: And that's where the quality comic strip art of today is emerging.

955
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,720
Rym: Plus, it just seems like so many newspapers are so afraid of offending anyone that they choose the least possibly offensive things they could ever get.

956
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:24,099
Scott: And it seems like a lot of those comic writing Marmaduke is a big dog.

957
00:45:24,542 --> 00:45:25,357
Rym: That's the whole joke.

958
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:35,902
Scott: It seems like a lot of the the newspaper strip creators are not so concerned with like advancing the art form as they are with cranking out comics and keeping making their money.

959
00:45:35,922 --> 00:45:38,180
Scott: But actually and then they make their money off a side thing.

960
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,220
Rym: It used to not be that way.

961
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:48,940
Rym: I mean, Bill Watterson, he fought with the newspapers and he's the reason that people could ever have a good, interestingly formatted newspaper comic.

962
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,626
Rym: He he basically had the power to force the newspapers to let him do what he wanted and let him experiment.

963
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:57,208
Scott: And then he and then he sort of said, oh, it's all bullshit and he stopped.

964
00:45:57,228 --> 00:45:57,494
Scott: Yeah.

965
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:58,665
Rym: And I kind of agree.

966
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:01,922
Scott: And then the newspapers just sort of won because he wasn't pushing them anymore.

967
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:08,320
Rym: Of course, newspapers in general, the only possible use of a print newspaper, at least for us geeks, is local news.

968
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:08,882
Rym: But you know what?

969
00:46:10,207 --> 00:46:13,300
Rym: Local news is almost never has anything to do with me.

970
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,324
Scott: Thing is, the funny.

971
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:27,420
Scott: what I find so funny is that you can read all of the comic strips that are in the newspaper online for free the same day, because remember, the newspaper and the comic strips in it are not targeted at anyone who knows there's an Internet.

972
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:28,108
Scott: Yeah.

973
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:28,575
Scott: Yeah.

974
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:29,882
Scott: Oh, well.

975
00:46:31,393 --> 00:46:32,360
Scott: Newspaper comic strips.

976
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,143
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't matter.

977
00:46:33,203 --> 00:46:46,882
Rym: It's kind of a cop out show because maybe next week when Scott's watched some Avatar and I've read some comics, this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

978
00:46:47,003 --> 00:46:49,479
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

979
00:46:50,180 --> 00:47:01,340

981
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,700
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

983
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:18,259
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
