00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,367
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 13th.

2
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:12,290
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:13,033
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:14,598
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:19,831
Rym: Tonight we bring you the board slash card slash party game, Citadel's.

6
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:26,908
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:34,230
Rym: I'm real glad that I left the windows on my laptop.

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,044
Scott: Yeah, you know, I also bought the Civ IV on my fancy new computer.

9
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:41,950
Rym: And I would never play it at home.

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,037
Rym: I have too much to do.

11
00:00:43,057 --> 00:00:52,030
Rym: I mean, I remember when I was in high school, I'd come home and I'd I'd sit there in front of the computer for like five hours playing Civ II while doing other things.

12
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,610
Rym: But I don't have the kind of time anymore.

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,510
Rym: But now by having steam on my laptop, I've been playing Civ IV every day on the train.

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,190
Rym: And let me tell you, the Roman Empire honor Gaius Fenius Clodius doing pretty shittily.

15
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:08,059
Scott: Roman, not so good.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,670
Scott: It's all about the Xerxes action.

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:18,597
Rym: All I got to say is that Civ IV, so far from what I've played, is rivaling Civ II and how fun it is.

18
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:21,830
Scott: You know, it's pretty much just the same game only modernized.

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,813
Scott: So why wouldn't it?

20
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:28,670
Rym: There's more to it than that because Civ III was more like Civ II modernized, but it wasn't as good in my opinion.

21
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:29,914
Scott: Well, they didn't really.

22
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:32,387
Scott: they did some sort of weird kind of things in it.

23
00:01:32,407 --> 00:01:35,479
Scott: Some of those things they kept in Civ IV and some of the things they didn't.

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,390
Rym: I feel like they learned a lot from Civ III and Civ IV so far is super, super fun.

25
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:48,882
Scott: I bought Civ III like the day it came out or whatever, and then I played it some, but not nearly as much, not even close to as much as I've played like Civ II.

26
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:50,610
Scott: It was it was like a drop in the bucket.

27
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,950
Scott: Even compared to like there are games where I like play them once, I beat them, I don't play them again.

28
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:58,589
Scott: I played Civ III like less than some of those games.

29
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,750
Rym: Yeah, I never bought Civ III, but I played it a bunch.

30
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:03,710
Rym: And Civ IV is just doing it for me.

31
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:11,450
Rym: I mean, I think what really gets me is that the game is actually balanced to the point where you don't have to always do everything as every civilization.

32
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,377
Scott: That's my problem, though, is it's not.

33
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:17,294
Scott: no matter what the game does, you know, the game might be that might be all good.

34
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:20,330
Scott: But me, it's like I need to have every wonder.

35
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,810
Scott: I need to build every single domestic improvement in every single city.

36
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:26,290
Scott: I need to have everything, every single science.

37
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:31,190
Scott: I need to have everything maxed out and then I will build military units and fight people.

38
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,772
Scott: It's like.

39
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:47,602
Rym: that's why we need to play a multiplayer, because while you're Persian, la di da is going on with you science and your books, the armies of Rims Rome, while marching with my one warrior, take all that nice fancy science, make my own gunpowder and take over.

40
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:53,128
Scott: the rest of the thing is I always build like two defense guys in each city just to, you know, but that's it.

41
00:02:54,171 --> 00:03:05,150
Rym: See, I use a kind of perimeter defensive depth where I actually have a post units away from my cities that can hold bad guys off just long enough for me to, I guess, step up domestic production.

42
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:13,829
Scott: And that's the thing is like the effort it takes to like build a unit and move them out there is like, ah, I hate doing that for it's practically zero.

43
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:14,652
Scott: Yeah, I know.

44
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:21,270
Scott: But and then it's like, you know, that those few turns it takes to build that unit, I could have been building a wonder or something.

45
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:21,610
Scott: Yeah.

46
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,012
Scott: You know what?

47
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:26,010
Rym: All that time Rome was building legions to defend itself from barbarian invasions.

48
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:28,249
Rym: They could have just been building more roads.

49
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:28,941
Scott: I know.

50
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:29,368
Scott: All right.

51
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:34,390
Rym: The problem is, God, in the real world, barbarians were there and they kept coming.

52
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,977
Scott: I mean, as it seems like in history, Russia usually like build one strong guy to go around and kill a barbarian.

53
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,370
Rym: So that didn't work so well.

54
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,952
Scott: It worked for me.

55
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:51,630
Rym: And so to see the world, the real world historically is actually a lot like gauntlet because you're trying to play your game and do your stuff over in Rome and Greece.

56
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:55,050
Rym: But you never destroy that monster generator in Russia.

57
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,854
Scott: And it just keeps making barbarian death randomly show up when you have no potions around the thirteen hundreds.

58
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:01,196
Rym: He did.

59
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,249
Rym: Yeah, they didn't have any potions then.

60
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,420
Scott: Oh, snap.

61
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:05,190
Rym: Oh, snap.

62
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,073
Rym: Too soon.

63
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:06,495
Rym: Too soon.

64
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:15,090
Scott: But yeah, even today where I, I called in sick despite not being sick.

65
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:17,990
Scott: I'm sure no one listens to this at my work and they wouldn't care anyway.

66
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:25,695
Scott: But I'd like I had to call in sick because I had to do laundry and clean the bathroom and go get an oil change that.

67
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,670
Scott: But I failed at that and do all sorts of other stuff.

68
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:29,938
Rym: Well, you didn't fail.

69
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,489
Rym: The valvoline failed you.

70
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:32,909
Scott: Yeah, the valvoline failed me.

71
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:33,955
Scott: That's the second time.

72
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:36,230
Scott: There's a close valvoline and a faraway valvoline.

73
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,870
Scott: The faraway valvoline has always been great.

74
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,935
Scott: The close one sucks.

75
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:42,376
Scott: And this is the second time the close one has sucked with the exact same suckage.

76
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,010
Scott: So I'm just not going to go to that one anymore.

77
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,134
Scott: And I guess the next time we go down the road whenever I'll just go to the faraway valvoline.

78
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,630
Rym: I usually go to the one in Newburgh.

79
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,989
Scott: Yeah, I don't feel like going to Newburgh, though.

80
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:55,070
Rym: The thing is, it's not any further away than the one over here.

81
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,844
Scott: I know, but I had to pay the toll to dollar.

82
00:04:57,912 --> 00:04:58,610
Scott: So that's a dollar.

83
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:07,229
Rym: If you were at that shitty valvoline and they said, no, we don't have your oil filter, would you have paid a dollar for them to have suddenly had it?

84
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:10,343
Rym: Yes.

85
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,880
Rym: Well, well, well, there we go.

86
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,879
Scott: Anyway, how do I know the valvoline across the river would have had it, though?

87
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:17,200
Rym: I've never had a problem.

88
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,140
Scott: Anyway, point is, took a day off, got everything done, released a lot of things.

89
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:25,580
Scott: I went to the post office doing good stuff.

90
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,830
Scott: So now I'm all cleared up and I was able to play lots of video games that I played some Bioshock's.

91
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,360
Rym: How far did you get?

92
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,249
Rym: Enjoying that game?

93
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,059
Scott: I killed a doctor.

94
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,343
Rym: You know what?

95
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,780
Rym: As long as I've owned the game, that's as far as I got.

96
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:42,222
Rym: And then I killed the doctor and I haven't really played it since I forgot what I was doing.

97
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:42,524
Rym: Yeah.

98
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:45,300
Scott: Then I killed one of those, you know, guys on the box cover.

99
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,949
Rym: That's actually where I save the game.

100
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,660
Rym: is it like the game sets you up.

101
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,800
Rym: They're like, yeah, here's the deal with those things and those girls.

102
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:53,288
Rym: And then they're like, all right.

103
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:59,920
Rym: And you walk out and then immediately there's one there and you're like, I could kill it or I could just keep walking.

104
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,639
Scott: The thing is, in that game, I just keep it's like I'll die and then I'll keep running out of ammo and the other stuff.

105
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:12,882
Scott: And it's just like, oh, and but you can die infinity times because you always come back to life.

106
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:14,349
Scott: But it's just.

107
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,560
Scott: it's so like, all right, do it again.

108
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,503
Scott: Do it again.

109
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:25,779
Scott: Because I never have enough ammo and stuff at any one time where I can just like just zoom through the game without having to constantly die and redo bits.

110
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:31,973
Scott: Anyway, also, I think I played some Mario Kart.

111
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:33,596
Scott: 150 CC on.

112
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:35,220
Scott: Mario Kart is actually hard.

113
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,440
Scott: It's not but it's not hard.

114
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,480
Rym: It's not hard because it's hard, hard because I'll be in first place.

115
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,359
Rym: Then I get hit by seven blue shells.

116
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:43,082
Scott: Yeah.

117
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:53,740
Scott: It's like if you think that annoying shit happens in the 50 and the hundred CC, it happens like times a thousand of the 150 CC like yesterday because I skipped the hundred CC and went straight to the 150 just to beat the single player crap.

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,900
Rym: And I remember I was in first place, three, three races in a row.

119
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:01,919
Rym: All I had to do was do OK in the last race to win.

120
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:11,075
Rym: And in the last race, I got hit by a series of items that put me from first place to 12th place and I ended in 12th.

121
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:14,680
Rym: And as a result, I lost the worst.

122
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,571
Scott: I landed it was 11th.

123
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,920
Scott: But yeah, that's a bad.

124
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,903
Scott: It was literally.

125
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:28,760
Rym: I got hit by a blue shell and as I recovered, I got hit by red shell, red shell, and then a star went past me and then 12th place passed me as a bullet.

126
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,500
Rym: Bill knocked me over, went over the finish line.

127
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:32,979
Rym: I just fuck it.

128
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,537
Rym: I just turned the way off upstairs.

129
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,159
Scott: It's I'll get through it.

130
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:39,139
Scott: And, you know, hopefully that'll unlock.

131
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:44,559
Scott: I'm not I'm guessing as to what it will unlock, but I'm hoping that unlocks the play the tracks in reverse mode.

132
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:46,180
Rym: You could just read the Internet.

133
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:46,686
Scott: I know.

134
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:47,720
Scott: But that's I love that.

135
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:52,280
Scott: Because it's like you get twice as many tracks, even though you don't really get twice as many tracks.

136
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,740
Rym: Plus, I mean, like, uh, Peach Gardens is really fun in reverse.

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,564
Scott: Yeah, it's a good one.

138
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:57,613
Scott: Oh, oh.

139
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,379
Scott: And otherwise, I was playing the was it the last wins.

140
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,542
Scott: I forgot.

141
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:06,887
Scott: I remember the name of the game, the game where we were a game, which I'm about to get by.

142
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,180
Rym: Oh, oh, yeah.

143
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:09,468
Scott: So I'm playing.

144
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,439
Scott: I guess is lost wins.

145
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:11,082
Scott: Right.

146
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,660
Scott: And it's as we were a game.

147
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,865
Scott: And I guess it cost me what, 10 bucks, I think, technically, because it was a thousand we points.

148
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:19,900
Scott: Right game.

149
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,040
Scott: Definitely worth 10 bucks.

150
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,740
Scott: I can I can tell you that it's really pretty.

151
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:25,831
Rym: And I like the style.

152
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:26,699
Rym: I like everything about it.

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:26,921
Scott: Yeah.

154
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:36,802
Scott: I mean, that the production values visually and audibly, audibly, audibly, audibly of the game compared to other ten dollar games, it like blows them out of the water.

155
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:38,859
Scott: I don't know how long the game is.

156
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:41,179
Rym: It blows them out of the water.

157
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,602
Rym: Yeah.

158
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:46,840
Scott: I don't know how long the game is because I've only played a tiny bit of it, you know, but I've played enough to get the ideas.

159
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,780
Scott: Basically, you control this little guy with the with the analog stick on the nunchuck.

160
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,783
Scott: All right.

161
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:56,602
Scott: And then everything else you do with the we mo and you'll be like, you know, blow it.

162
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:57,125
Scott: You mostly.

163
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:59,859
Scott: you're blowing the little guy up into the air because he can't jump.

164
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:00,382
Scott: All right.

165
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:04,523
Scott: But also you'll be doing stuff like make him fall down slowly so it doesn't get hurt.

166
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:06,979
Scott: Blow bad guys around so they die.

167
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:11,860
Scott: Blow fire from a torch into a wooden thing so it burns.

168
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,380
Scott: Blow water onto a plant so it grows.

169
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:17,700
Rym: See, now this is the kind of stuff it's kind of like the DS.

170
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:24,980
Rym: You can make a game for the DS that uses the stylus, maybe, but it's just a good game that happens to be on the DS.

171
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,361
Rym: Or you can make a game that does something innovative with the stylus like Kirby's Canvas Curse.

172
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:29,562
Rym: Yes.

173
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:37,060
Scott: I mean, on one hand, a lot of the stuff in the game, it's sort of just like like a touch things and watch something happen.

174
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:49,359
Scott: Game sort of like, you know, you go to the arcade and they'll have like those Wild West shoot things and like you shoot the targets and then like you shoot a target and a guy will come in the salude and then you'll shoot a hat and the hat will fly

175
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:49,620
Rym: off.

176
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,360
Rym: Those were a lot more fun if you were in a little car and it wasn't cowboys, but pirates.

177
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:53,863
Scott: Yes.

178
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:55,780
Rym: And the animatronic pirates were all broken.

179
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,361
Scott: Yes.

180
00:09:56,803 --> 00:10:06,486
Scott: But, you know, it's sort of like one of those games because a lot of the game is walk around and you just you blow on stuff like you'll blow on some people and they'll go and that's it.

181
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,962
Scott: You know, it's sort of like you're just touching things to watch them animate.

182
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:19,822
Scott: But most of the stuff in the game actually does something and you're like, oh, and you sort of it's not always obvious, like they don't tell you, use the fire to burn that thing.

183
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:26,100
Scott: But you sort of you know, you're aiming at the screen, you put the wind near some fire and the fire starts to move.

184
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,984
Scott: So then you go, huh?

185
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:30,399
Scott: And you blow the fire out and makes these big fireballs like boom.

186
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:34,620
Scott: And then, you know, you touch some wood with it and, whoa, there goes burned.

187
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:35,327
Scott: Look at that.

188
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:36,380
Scott: It's cool stuff.

189
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:43,539
Scott: The only problem I'm having with the game so far is that they said go to the west of the falls and he's like, hey, that's where you woke up.

190
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,680
Scott: I went to and they're like, there's a shrine there.

191
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:47,979
Scott: I go to the west of the falls to the shrine.

192
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:50,900
Scott: It's a shrine I already got a while ago.

193
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,820
Scott: And I'm like, huh, where do I go now?

194
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,420
Scott: And there's no facts on the Internet.

195
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:56,407
Rym: So are you?

196
00:10:56,608 --> 00:10:58,060
Rym: I'm sure there's already a fact.

197
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,610
Scott: No, there isn't.

198
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:58,999
Scott: I checked.

199
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:04,780
Rym: How far did you check game facts and Google and Google and Google?

200
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:06,719
Rym: If you had a week, there'll be a fact.

201
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,562
Scott: I'm sure.

202
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:10,440
Scott: But basically, I'm going to just have to go.

203
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:18,720
Scott: I'm going to have to ignore the guy telling me to go west of the waterfall and just go fucking everywhere until I can find something new because I'm a little bit lost.

204
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,327
Rym: You must have missed something.

205
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,371
Rym: Maybe the game's not.

206
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:31,520
Scott: I mean, it might not have the polish of a Nintendo first party game where Nintendo did say that they were checking the games for bugs and they're checking the games for ESRV ratings.

207
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:32,168
Scott: And that was it.

208
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:32,938
Scott: Then they would put them up.

209
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,580
Rym: Yeah, but I mean, games that aren't a first party Nintendo game.

210
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,571
Rym: And when I say games that aren't a first party Nintendo game, I mean across all kinds of gaming.

211
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:42,000
Rym: Yeah.

212
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:51,960
Rym: Aren't quite put to the rigorous, not so much bug checking, but in terms of like player guiding, like game design testing that Nintendo seems to hold their game.

213
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,480
Scott: Yeah, but the rest of the game seems like it's a very high level of production quality.

214
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,959
Scott: Why would they screw up something like this?

215
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,059
Rym: You know, it's really easy to overlook things like that, though.

216
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:03,679
Rym: Yeah, just little things like where do you go now?

217
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:04,362
Scott: Yep.

218
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:07,300
Scott: Oh, well, well, we'll see where the game goes.

219
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:15,880
Scott: But if you got a Wii and you got ten bucks, right, and you're looking for a game to play, it's kind of hard to go wrong with this little guy.

220
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:23,059
Scott: I mean, if you like Kirby's Canvas Curse or any of those sorts of cute, short, innovative type of things, this is where it's at.

221
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,340
Rym: Now, the real news here is that I think we wear is going to be a big deal.

222
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,760
Scott: Yeah, well, the other things in the we wear, I didn't check them out yet.

223
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:33,398
Scott: Some of them seem meh, some of them seem OK.

224
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,339
Scott: We'll see what it goes.

225
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,716
Scott: But I'm waiting for the Dr.

226
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,000
Scott: Mario.

227
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:37,998
Scott: That's what I'm waiting for.

228
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:38,059
Rym: Dr.

229
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,539
Rym: Mario, I'm waiting for the dev kit.

230
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:41,519
Scott: Yeah, we'll have to work on that.

231
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,500
Scott: We need a company first.

232
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,519
Rym: We're working on that.

233
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:47,160
Rym: I mean, I have a feeling that we could make something for the we wear.

234
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,012
Rym: That would be amazing.

235
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:48,520
Scott: Probably.

236
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,623
Rym: We got a couple.

237
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,760
Scott: I don't know if we could do lost wins quality, though.

238
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:52,850
Rym: I don't know.

239
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,560
Rym: I don't know.

240
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,385
Rym: We got some talent.

241
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:56,700
Scott: Yeah, but it's a lot harder when I say we've got some talent.

242
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,459
Rym: I mean, we know people who have some talent we could collaborate with.

243
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,066
Scott: I don't know if we have lost wins.

244
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:04,500
Scott: level of it might take us a few games to get up that high.

245
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,280
Rym: Well, we start with some sort of, you know, 2D board game.

246
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,558
Rym: And then from there you make a tower defense game and then.

247
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,720
Scott: Yeah, we should definitely get a tower defense game.

248
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,020
Scott: If we can get the first tower defense game on the other we and it's a good one.

249
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:16,279
Scott: I think we're in business.

250
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,500
Rym: But moving on, I kind of just want to get on with the main bit.

251
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:26,260
Rym: I'm a little tired and I'm a little hungry and there wasn't much video game news I want to talk about.

252
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,155
Rym: I mean, I guess theoretically there's that whole DRM.

253
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:30,160
Rym: sick your arm thing.

254
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:32,959
Rym: But what am I going to say about that?

255
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,418
Rym: Things of the day.

256
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:50,700
Rym: Now, a couple of shows ago, a couple of Tuesday nights ago, I mentioned a game called Robin Hood for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

257
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,759
Rym: I don't remember this at all.

258
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:54,020
Rym: I brought it up on the show more than once.

259
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,699
Rym: It's a game that I owned.

260
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,160
Rym: I played extensively.

261
00:13:57,682 --> 00:13:58,226
Rym: I loved.

262
00:13:58,771 --> 00:13:59,920
Rym: at the same time I hated.

263
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:03,500
Rym: And it really surprised me that Scott had never heard of the game.

264
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,959
Rym: When I first brought it up, how would I have heard of it?

265
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:08,660
Scott: It was it was kind of how many games there were for the NES.

266
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,123
Rym: Yes.

267
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:09,637
Rym: And you know what?

268
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,660
Rym: It's weird, but I think I recognize the names of almost all of them.

269
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,355
Scott: I don't think so.

270
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,699
Rym: At least all the ones in the US.

271
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:16,658
Scott: I don't think so.

272
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,732
Rym: Well, I owned about 70 of them.

273
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,700
Scott: So, yeah, that's still there's way lots of them.

274
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,300
Scott: There's a lot of really obscure ones like nobody owned.

275
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,600
Rym: This one wasn't that obscure, though.

276
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,300
Rym: This is one of those million dollar.

277
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,039
Rym: All right.

278
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:31,840
Rym: So we got this movie, this Robin Hood movie.

279
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:34,600
Rym: We're going to make the game based on the movie.

280
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:37,320
Rym: No, not men in tights.

281
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,740
Rym: The quote unquote real Robin Hood movie where Robin of Locksley and all that crap.

282
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,659
Scott: You mean men in tights?

283
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,138
Scott: No, no, no.

284
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,118
Rym: OK, I do.

285
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,779
Rym: Men in Tights is, however, a most excellent movie.

286
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:54,220
Rym: But no, there was a Nintendo entertainment system game, Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.

287
00:14:55,101 --> 00:15:02,225
Rym: And I don't know how easily I can express to you what the hell this game was about.

288
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,319
Scott: It looks terrible to me.

289
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,640
Rym: It's actually not that bad.

290
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:12,396
Rym: The only real problem with this game is that it was kind of, I don't know, it tried to do too much with it.

291
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:16,100
Rym: As Rama would say, you try you try to do too much with it.

292
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:21,923
Rym: This is one of those games that pushed what the NES and the NES controller were capable of.

293
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:27,026
Scott: Yeah, this really looks like it should have been a DOS game, but instead it was an NES game.

294
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:29,160
Rym: So how do you how would you make a Robin Hood game?

295
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,820
Rym: You could make like a side scroll and bow and arrow game.

296
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:32,683
Scott: That sounds good.

297
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:36,780
Rym: You could make a top scroll and shmup like bow and arrow game.

298
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:38,820
Scott: I'd make sort of a Zelda type of game.

299
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,479
Rym: That's kind of what this is, kind of.

300
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:50,639
Rym: You could make a war game like, you know, you're Robin Hood and you set up like ambushes in the woods and you set up your stuff and then you have battles and, you know, you do all sorts of little north versus south action, something like that.

301
00:15:51,040 --> 00:16:01,700
Scott: Only instead of robbing trains for gold in the Civil War, you're robbing wagon trains in England for gold, then north versus south needs to be on the virtual console.

302
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,527
Scott: It sure does.

303
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:03,418
Rym: And we need to play it.

304
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:04,892
Rym: That game was so shitty.

305
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:07,672
Scott: That game is great.

306
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:08,360
Rym: It's great.

307
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,712
Rym: If you like really awesome.

308
00:16:11,145 --> 00:16:12,219
Rym: No, I'm not even joking.

309
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,560
Rym: I like that game a lot.

310
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:15,099
Rym: I really enjoy that game.

311
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:17,000
Rym: But that game is a shit.

312
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:17,992
Rym: It's a good game.

313
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:18,500
Rym: Yes.

314
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:25,220
Rym: Except if anyone who knows how to play it plays against anyone else who knows how to play it, you get into that, get to the end of the stage thing.

315
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:31,002
Rym: And I just whoever's on the defensive has one guy just stand there and trap you and you're done.

316
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:36,040
Rym: And then you get into a battle and both sides, neither side will move ever.

317
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,263
Rym: I'll move.

318
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:39,219
Scott: I said my horse is over and I'll just shoot him.

319
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:40,600
Scott: No, I'll chop you down.

320
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,164
Scott: You can't.

321
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:42,580
Rym: Yeah, it's impossible.

322
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:46,120
Scott: You can play the the cannon shooting game, but then you run out of bullets.

323
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,948
Rym: Your cannon dies.

324
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:47,898
Rym: That doesn't.

325
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:48,771
Rym: Yeah, it does.

326
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:49,340
Scott: It doesn't matter.

327
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,639
Scott: The can is not that useful anyway.

328
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,180
Rym: The cannons really useful.

329
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,048
Rym: You blow up the bridge.

330
00:16:53,452 --> 00:16:54,059
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

331
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,160
Scott: But if you blow up the bridge, how do you send your guys over?

332
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,700
Rym: You wait for the other person to give up and commit suicide.

333
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:00,860
Rym: That's how I usually play that game.

334
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,964
Rym: I blow up the bridge and say you either you're going to kill yourself or we're going to sit here.

335
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:05,500
Rym: Are you going to concede defeat?

336
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,960
Rym: That is why it is an awesome game, but simultaneously a shitty game.

337
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:13,781
Scott: Yeah.

338
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:19,642
Rym: But anyway, Robin Hood, this game begins in the Crusades and it follows the movie.

339
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:21,680
Scott: Sort of like how Man in Tights begins the Crusades.

340
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,839
Rym: Did you ever actually see the real Robin Hood movie?

341
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,347
Rym: The Men in Tights is making fun of only.

342
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:30,126
Scott: I've only seen the Man in Tights and I've read Robin Hood book.

343
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:31,980
Rym: You really haven't seen Prince of Thieves.

344
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:36,660
Scott: No, you really I've never seen any serious Robin Hood movies.

345
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:37,383
Rym: Wow.

346
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:39,859
Scott: Maybe I guess Disney isn't serious, is it?

347
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,468
Rym: I'd say it's serious.

348
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:43,260
Scott: No, you're you're a furry.

349
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:47,060
Rym: So, man, that Disney Robin Hood is the best Robin Hood.

350
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:47,445
Rym: No.

351
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,360
Rym: Yeah, definitely.

352
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:57,986
Rym: But anyway, Prince of this game is based on Prince of Thieves and you're Robin of Locksley and you're in the Crusades and you escape and then you meet the more and Peter and all these people.

353
00:17:58,007 --> 00:17:59,199
Rym: Peter dies and along the way.

354
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:08,300
Rym: And it's an RPG where you get these characters into your party and you equip people with armor and weapons and all this stuff with this, all these sub screens.

355
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,080
Rym: And it's super complicated.

356
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:14,220
Rym: And sometimes you're walking around all Willow for the NES style.

357
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:20,920
Rym: And sometimes you have a duel where it's side scrolling sword fighting and it's great because Sid Meier's Pirates.

358
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,579
Rym: Yeah, but kind of better than that, actually a lot better than that.

359
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:25,160
Scott: But Sid Meier's Pirates is good.

360
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,022
Rym: It was OK.

361
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:28,491
Rym: But then don't forget, there's also.

362
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:32,100
Rym: eventually you get the sword of Locksley, which is magical.

363
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:37,000
Rym: OK, but the game is super like text RPG.

364
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,400
Rym: It also has melee mode or as the kids down the street said, melee mode.

365
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:50,500
Scott: Melee, Super Smash Brothers Melee King Dedede, it is Dedede.

366
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,122
Rym: I know.

367
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:54,200
Rym: No, I'm saying today day and I'm not going to switch.

368
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,940
Scott: We'll see about that today.

369
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,597
Rym: Day is far superior, Mr.

370
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,800
Scott: Physical Plant.

371
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:00,478
Rym: I still say Physical Plant is.

372
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,041
Scott: Yeah.

373
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:04,439
Rym: Anyway, anyway, so the game.

374
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:21,420
Rym: Follows the movie up to a point and I think one of the moments of departure is when the people in your village in the trees become ill with the disease and to cure them, you go to the magic springs of something or other to get the holy water to save.

375
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,659
Scott: It's got to be tossing magic in there, but the magic springs, you can't just leave it mundane, full of poisonous monsters.

376
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:28,705
Scott: Yeah.

377
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:30,140
Rym: And that's not the only thing.

378
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,846
Rym: There's a lot of plus.

379
00:19:31,946 --> 00:19:38,180
Rym: you find random pieces of meat and eat these pieces of meat and there's a million items and a million weapons and a million things.

380
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,819
Rym: The game was glitchy as all fuck.

381
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:42,140
Rym: My thing of the day is that this game exists.

382
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,868
Rym: And here's some YouTube that will show you everything you need to know about this game, including the end.

383
00:19:45,888 --> 00:19:47,000
Rym: All right.

384
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,640
Scott: So you're playing Missile Command, you know, the game where at the bottom you got a gun and at the top is missiles coming to get you.

385
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,680
Rym: I might have a rabbit.

386
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,243
Rym: I might.

387
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:57,139
Scott: And then you sort of shoot on the screen.

388
00:19:57,501 --> 00:20:05,940
Scott: And when you shoot your body, the things you're shooting blow up in midair and they destroy the incoming missiles with your ground to air missiles.

389
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,540
Rym: Missile Command is a great game.

390
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,244
Scott: It's a pretty good game.

391
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:11,161
Rym: I think it was one of my favorite games on the Atari when I was a kid.

392
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:16,160
Scott: The original missile arc, the arcade Missile Command was played with a trackball and made it much superior.

393
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,700
Scott: And then little tiny buttons so that you could, you know, little tiny buttons you would put your fingers on would shoot from the different missile launchers on the bottom.

394
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:26,802
Scott: So they'd be like three missile launchers and you could shoot from the left, the middle of the right.

395
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:30,220
Scott: But if they got destroyed, then you couldn't use that missile launcher anymore.

396
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:33,841
Scott: Or if you emptied that missile launcher of missiles, then you couldn't shoot from it anymore.

397
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:36,554
Rym: And there needs to be something versus Missile Command and the.

398
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:37,519
Rym: we were happy.

399
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,121
Scott: All right.

400
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:47,360
Scott: So and then like on the NES and the Atari, like you would use the joystick of the numpads, like move this little dot around instead of using a trackball.

401
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:49,440
Scott: And there's a lot of missile commands for the computer.

402
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,290
Scott: We use the mouse.

403
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,079
Scott: Those are pretty good.

404
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:52,840
Scott: And I think there's a DS one.

405
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,831
Scott: We use the stylus.

406
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:54,317
Scott: That was OK.

407
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:55,221
Scott: Right.

408
00:20:55,844 --> 00:21:02,180
Scott: But this missile command that I'm showing you a video of is perhaps the best Missile Command interface ever.

409
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:09,840
Scott: And I think the military should adapt this technology in their in their missile defense strategy, well, at least against missiles on a two dimensional plane.

410
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:10,404
Scott: Exactly.

411
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,279
Scott: Basically, check this out.

412
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,300
Scott: They have a multi touch projection screen.

413
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:15,782
Scott: Right.

414
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:23,780
Scott: So you can touch it in multiple places at once and you touch it and wherever you touch is where the missiles go.

415
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:32,700
Scott: And the problem here is that they have infinity missiles, which is sort of makes it a dumb game because you just touch all the incoming bombs or missiles and you destroy them all.

416
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,102
Scott: That's it.

417
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:36,059
Scott: But if they limited the missiles that you could shoot.

418
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:39,100
Scott: This would actually be a really good game of missile command.

419
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,999
Scott: And I think that they should implement this in an awesome way.

420
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:50,420
Scott: And, you know, the video watching the video itself is actually pretty cool and pretty interesting, especially if you have ever played the missile command.

421
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,539
Scott: Do you understand the missile command?

422
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,088
Rym: But seriously, the command missile command.

423
00:21:55,249 --> 00:22:04,389
Scott: also as a side note, if you are interested in missile command, you should do some research on the Internet's about the story of missile command two and how like.

424
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,564
Scott: there were a few machines and they were like test machines and you can't get them.

425
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:10,260
Scott: And there's like one and the game's all weird.

426
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:13,940
Scott: And yeah, it's a pretty crazy story of video game history.

427
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,419
Rym: If I was if I was a wealthy member of the idle ridge, I would probably take it upon myself to own that machine.

428
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:22,460
Scott: Well, it'd be very difficult.

429
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:27,994
Rym: Well, because obviously the like the bottom floor of my mansion would also be a classic video gaming museum.

430
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:28,439
Scott: Duh.

431
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:31,580
Rym: Oh, and there's one other thing that's very important.

432
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:38,840
Rym: So that Robin Hood game, when you beat it, has the kiss and the kiss is pretty epic.

433
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,400
Scott: I'm good.

434
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:44,109
Rym: It's in the video.

435
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,359
Rym: I recommend you watch it.

436
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:50,240
Rym: So without further ado, I'm going to talk about not a video game, but a board.

437
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,420
Rym: Well, actually, a card game.

438
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,379
Scott: It's a card game, but it comes in a box.

439
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,740
Rym: It's a board game.

440
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,000
Scott: So it counts like a board game, but it's a card game even like using cards.

441
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:01,099
Scott: Well, there's cards and there's little tokens that represent gold.

442
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:06,040
Rym: It's you know, actually, we'll go one step further, regardless of whether you say it's a card game or a board game.

443
00:23:06,503 --> 00:23:08,540
Rym: It is a party game, pretty much.

444
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:12,840
Scott: So the game is called Citadel's and it's by I forget the French guy's name.

445
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:14,777
Rym: Hold on, Bruno Fidutti.

446
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:17,820
Scott: I hope it's by duty enough by Duddy.

447
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:21,080
Rym: I picked the thing up because, you know, you know, who wrote it?

448
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,381
Rym: Crap.

449
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:21,865
Rym: I forgot.

450
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,020
Rym: I flip it over and I looked for the author normally would.

451
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:26,199
Rym: And it's by Roulet book.

452
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:27,127
Rym: Oh, shit.

453
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:28,379
Scott: Roulet book.

454
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:32,780
Scott: It's published by in the US by Fantasy Flight Games.

455
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,339
Scott: And you can actually get it in like a little tiny box, not the big box we have it in.

456
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:50,700
Rym: Now, I'll start by saying that if you're looking for a light game to play with friends, especially at a party, especially if you have exactly seven friends plus yourself to make eight people, though, gaga, fewer people actually works pretty well.

457
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,180
Rym: The game the game scales for anywhere from two to eight or nine.

458
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:55,677
Scott: Yeah, two is a little weird.

459
00:23:56,483 --> 00:24:01,022
Scott: But if you have at least four to eight is good, but you can play it with two or three works.

460
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:05,260
Scott: By the way, it is the basic deal of citadels, right?

461
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:08,340
Scott: There are eight jobs or people.

462
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:12,496
Scott: There's like these eight job cars, all the roles, roles, roles, right?

463
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,570
Scott: The assassin, the thief, the magician, the king, the bishop, the merchant, the architect and the warlord.

464
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,997
Scott: All right.

465
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:21,520
Scott: So on your turn, basically on every turn, right?

466
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:25,199
Scott: One person takes the deck of all eight roles.

467
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,865
Scott: And depending on how many players there are, they may or may not discard some of these roles.

468
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:32,900
Rym: Like they might discard one face.

469
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,568
Scott: Actually, I think you can only play with seven people because they always discard one at the beginning, right?

470
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:38,580
Rym: It doesn't matter.

471
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:39,101
Scott: Yeah.

472
00:24:39,823 --> 00:24:47,300
Scott: Anyway, and the first player secretly selects one of the roles and then passes all the cards to the person to the left.

473
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,360
Rym: But he also secretly discards one, depending on the number of players.

474
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:50,883
Scott: Right.

475
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:51,506
Scott: That's right.

476
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:54,340
Scott: You can only play with seven players because there are eight roles.

477
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:58,220
Scott: You secretly discard one and then you take one and you pass to the left.

478
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:08,931
Scott: So now the person to the second person looks at all the six remaining roles and they know the person to the right of them is one of the two that are missing, but they don't know which of those two.

479
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:09,660
Scott: Right.

480
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:12,560
Scott: And then they pick one and pass it to the left.

481
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:19,820
Scott: And then that person knows, OK, the two people to the right of me, one of them is three missing roles and there's two people to the right of me.

482
00:25:19,961 --> 00:25:20,586
Scott: So one of those.

483
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:21,090
Scott: Right.

484
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,280
Scott: And so on and so forth.

485
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:25,640
Scott: And the last person just sort of takes the last remaining role.

486
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:32,024
Scott: And then they I think the last person they get to roll, the last person always gets a choice.

487
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,239
Scott: Yeah, they get two roles.

488
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:37,240
Scott: They pick one of the two remaining roles and they discard the final one.

489
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,144
Rym: None of that matters.

490
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:44,200
Rym: All you need to know is that you'll go around passing the deck and everyone will choose a role semi-secretly.

491
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,059
Rym: And depending on the left right mechanics, you know a little bit about like, you know, that no one before you took any of the roles that you can.

492
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,340
Scott: You're never 100 percent sure who's what, but you have information about who is what.

493
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:58,340
Rym: Now, this is the really interesting part of this game.

494
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:05,854
Rym: On your turn, you basically have a standard action and then the special action that you do lets you do and you have cards.

495
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,726
Rym: You're trying to build buildings.

496
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:14,023
Rym: The object of the game is to build eight buildings and then the game will end and whoever has the most points based on what buildings you've built wins.

497
00:26:14,123 --> 00:26:17,180
Scott: The real goal of the game is the building of buildings to get points.

498
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:24,139
Scott: Like I just said, yes, but the building of the buildings is pretty much just a side effect of the game where you choose the roles.

499
00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:31,480
Scott: So it's like if you win the game where you choose the roles, the buildings themselves are sort of just score keeping of the role selection.

500
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:46,019
Rym: But anyway, the gist of the game is that you take actions based on these roles, not knowing who anyone else's role is and actions you take against other players with one exception are taken based on the role.

501
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:56,400
Rym: So if this doesn't quite make sense, let's say number one, the assassin, let's say I choose the assassin when we actually play the game where everyone has their role.

502
00:26:57,142 --> 00:26:59,880
Rym: The king calls out the roles one by one in order.

503
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,317
Rym: So first he calls out the assassin and then the assassin flips the crown.

504
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,848
Scott: But yeah, whatever.

505
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:08,940
Rym: The king wears the crown, right?

506
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:11,699
Rym: He holds the crown and then he gives up the crown.

507
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,161
Scott: Right.

508
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:15,660
Rym: Anyway, I don't think that the specifics of the rules matter.

509
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:16,719
Rym: And I don't think anyone cares.

510
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:20,340
Scott: I think it's just, you know, I don't want to be confused.

511
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:23,140
Rym: I don't think it matters anyway.

512
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,084
Scott: I've been all.

513
00:27:24,487 --> 00:27:26,500
Rym: So the assassin, I'm the assassin.

514
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,429
Rym: I flip over my card.

515
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,300
Rym: Everyone goes, ah, shit.

516
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,143
Rym: Rims the assassin.

517
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,900
Rym: Now, I don't say I'm going to assassinate Scott.

518
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:38,820
Rym: I say I'm going to assassinate the merchant or the magician.

519
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:39,403
Scott: Right.

520
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:41,660
Scott: So he doesn't know if I'm the magician or the merchant.

521
00:27:41,781 --> 00:27:45,780
Scott: He can sometimes guess sometimes logically deduce.

522
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,980
Rym: I'm going to read for you from the description of the assassin.

523
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,040
Rym: Announce the title of another character that you wish to murder.

524
00:27:52,680 --> 00:28:01,839
Rym: The player who has the murdered character must say nothing and must remain silent when that character's name is called upon to take his turn.

525
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,259
Rym: The murdered character misses his entire turn.

526
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,081
Scott: Right.

527
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:10,624
Scott: So basically, just everyone takes their turn, except this one person just keeps quiet.

528
00:28:10,644 --> 00:28:13,080
Rym: Like, say, I murdered the magician.

529
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:15,014
Rym: Then the king calls out the thief.

530
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:21,583
Rym: And then he calls out the magician and everyone laughs because someone didn't get to go.

531
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:26,598
Rym: Usually the person who didn't get to go go something, you know, he says something along the lines of fuckers.

532
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,189
Scott: Yeah.

533
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,719
Scott: But only at the end of the turn.

534
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:38,840
Scott: Basically, when you get to the end of the turn, after you do the warlord, which is the final role to take because they're numbered one to eight and whoever the eighth one goes last always.

535
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:41,940
Scott: So that's why the assassin always goes first.

536
00:28:42,842 --> 00:28:46,863
Scott: At the end, you'll know who the murdered person was because they're the only person who didn't go.

537
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:50,540
Scott: So you're just like, ah, you don't find out until the very end.

538
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,920
Scott: Because, you know, before the final role is called, there is two people left.

539
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,938
Scott: And, you know, one of them was the person who got killed and one of them isn't.

540
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,615
Rym: Now you keep going and then, you know, the thief is called.

541
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,122
Rym: the thief is the same as the assassin.

542
00:29:02,162 --> 00:29:07,565
Rym: But instead of killing the other character, they steal all of their gold.

543
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:09,500
Scott: Yeah, all of it.

544
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,754
Scott: Now the assassin could kill the thief, but the thief go.

545
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:16,526
Scott: the assassin always goes before the thief.

546
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,680
Scott: So the assassin, why would they kill the thief?

547
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:26,797
Scott: Because they don't have to worry about their gold being stolen because they can spend all their gold unless before the thief gets to take their turn, less.

548
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:28,022
Rym: it's near the end of the game.

549
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:34,693
Rym: And they know that logically whoever is winning, if they're not winning is going and the assassin is not an option because you took.

550
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:39,700
Rym: the assassin is going to take the thief in order to go earlier and build their building and win the game.

551
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,151
Rym: And thus you assassinate the thief.

552
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:42,220
Rym: But then they know that.

553
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,720
Scott: And thus the problem of this game, the game is pretty much just which cup is poison.

554
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,121
Rym: Yes.

555
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:49,659
Rym: Well, the poison is in both cups.

556
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Rym: Pretty much the game is very fun in that you can logically deduce down to a point.

557
00:29:56,221 --> 00:30:06,320
Rym: But if you are smart, you can deduce perfectly to the point that it comes down to an arbitrary 50 50 decision every time in every action you take.

558
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,560
Rym: And as a result, as per, I guess, the principles of game theory, whenever a decision is arbitrary, choose randomly, you must act randomly.

559
00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:17,202
Rym: Yep.

560
00:30:17,664 --> 00:30:25,302
Scott: So if you're given a hand of like three rolls to choose from and none of them are really, you know, sort of the obvious better one to take, just shuffle them up and pick one at random.

561
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:31,540
Rym: Now, the thing is, you can't like the truly is you also have to show everyone else that you actually are doing it randomly.

562
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:32,102
Rym: Yep.

563
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:37,465
Rym: Because otherwise they might still make it like they might try to make decisions based on whatever.

564
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:41,820
Rym: Or you might be tempted to make a decision when you should just be doing it randomly.

565
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:43,213
Scott: Yep, yep, yep.

566
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,640
Scott: But yeah, basically the whole game sort of revolves around the gold because it's like some of the roles get you gold.

567
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,439
Scott: Some of them allow you to spend more or less gold.

568
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,220
Rym: Yeah, there's different colored buildings.

569
00:30:54,621 --> 00:31:03,299
Rym: And then there's three different colored roles where if you're the merchant whose color is green and your turn, you get extra gold for every green building that you own.

570
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:03,881
Scott: Yeah.

571
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:05,877
Scott: And you also get extra gold because the merchant is mad gold.

572
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:07,479
Rym: That's where all the meta comes in.

573
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,444
Rym: All right.

574
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:10,999
Rym: So I've got four green buildings.

575
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,023
Rym: Ha.

576
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:14,780
Rym: Rym wants that merchant because he wants some money.

577
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:17,959
Scott: But getting one of each different color building helps you with the points.

578
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:22,402
Rym: But Scott, who knows that Rym is currently winning, knows that Rym wants to take the merchant.

579
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:27,240
Rym: And thus, if he takes the assassin to the thief, especially Rym has money, he's going to hit the merchant.

580
00:31:27,342 --> 00:31:27,668
Rym: Yeah.

581
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:28,279
Rym: Rym knows that.

582
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,680
Rym: So Rym's not going to take the merchant.

583
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,829
Rym: Rym's going to take something else.

584
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:31,840
Rym: But Scott knows that.

585
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,580
Rym: So he tries to think, what is the least likely thing Rym would take and choose that?

586
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,600
Rym: And thus, smart players all play randomly and the game breaks down.

587
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,439
Rym: It isn't fun anymore.

588
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,021
Scott: Yep.

589
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:42,800
Scott: But for a party game, it's super fun.

590
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,760
Rym: This is so fun to play with a big group of people.

591
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,020
Rym: Yeah.

592
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:55,262
Rym: It's also a great game to play with people who aren't into German board games or aren't into gaming in any way, because there's kind of a little bit of a role playing element in.

593
00:31:55,604 --> 00:32:01,200
Rym: And the game is fun enough and simple enough to where you can get pretty much anyone into playing it.

594
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:13,465
Scott: The actual gameplay mostly breaks down to get gold, hold on to the gold long enough without having it be stolen or anything, and then spend it on something, you know, and try to get it.

595
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:16,600
Scott: And if you keep piling up the gold, it's going to get stolen.

596
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:21,680
Scott: But in order to buy the more expensive buildings, you have to pile it up over the course of multiple turns.

597
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,279
Rym: And the game is expertly and exquisitely balanced in that regard, because there's one you can only build one building per round.

598
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:28,783
Rym: Yeah.

599
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:30,739
Rym: But there is one role who goes near the end.

600
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:33,355
Rym: Number seven, the architect sketch.

601
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:34,961
Scott: Yep.

602
00:32:35,343 --> 00:32:39,620
Rym: The architect can build up to three buildings.

603
00:32:40,462 --> 00:32:45,883
Scott: If you got a lot of money, if Rym has a lot of money, right, he's probably going to take the architect.

604
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:50,620
Rym: But the thief knows that Rym wants to take the architect.

605
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:58,220
Scott: So the thief says, I'm going to steal all the money from the architect because that's the person who's likely to have, you know, a lot of money they want to spend.

606
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,160
Rym: And thus, as a result, people tend to avoid the roles that are the most useful to them.

607
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,782
Scott: Yes.

608
00:33:02,863 --> 00:33:06,521
Scott: It's like, well, if Rym takes the architect, obviously he's going to get stolen from.

609
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:11,860
Scott: So he'll take, you know, the warlord instead and he'll use his money to destroy someone's building.

610
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:30,063
Rym: Now, the main reason that this game is so great to play, to get people who aren't gamers into it, is that a lot of people are really turned off from more hardcore games from the fact that they take the game personally or they play with someone and then someone takes an action that just ruins them in the game and they take it personally or that bothers them.

611
00:33:30,104 --> 00:33:31,238
Rym: Or why did you attack me?

612
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:38,486
Rym: And this game eliminates that almost entirely because you never attack a person with one special exception.

613
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:40,740
Rym: I'll get to in a second, which is the most fun part of the game.

614
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,039
Rym: You attack the roles.

615
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,019
Rym: So I don't attack Scott, I attack the king.

616
00:33:45,462 --> 00:33:45,703
Rym: Yeah.

617
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:49,040
Rym: And as a result, it removes the personality from it.

618
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,499
Rym: It removes the like, I attacked Scott, I attacked you.

619
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:57,620
Rym: And it really makes the game more friendly for a group of casual gamers.

620
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:58,021
Scott: Yeah.

621
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:09,601
Scott: And it lets you have a game of attacking other people and getting attacked by other people, which a lot of the more party ish games tend to not have direct conflict between players.

622
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:23,400
Scott: But since you're not attacking the human being, you're attacking the card they've chosen, then people who tend to get pissed off with that kind of game because they're I don't know, they have a problem, they can play this kind of game without being upset.

623
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:30,260
Scott: And plus, pretty much no matter what you do in this game, you're pretty much forced to attack other people and be attacked constantly.

624
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:32,580
Scott: So you're going to get used to it real quick.

625
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:44,179
Scott: It's not like a game like, say, Shogun, where, you know, it's like attacking someone is special and, you know, so that's a game where you build up for an hour and then suddenly everyone attacks everyone.

626
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,101
Scott: Yeah.

627
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:45,609
Scott: Yeah.

628
00:34:46,643 --> 00:34:48,340
Rym: But there is one exception to this.

629
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,719
Rym: And this really makes the game fun, in my opinion.

630
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:56,340
Rym: There is one more role, one special role, the warlord, the warlord.

631
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:05,080
Scott: Do you use the warlord to destroy buildings, other people's buildings, sometimes your own, if there's really a reason to and you spend money to do it.

632
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:12,280
Scott: So if you have a lot of money, you can either build buildings to get your score up or destroy other people's buildings to get their score down.

633
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:24,203
Scott: And if you take the score down of the person who's ahead of you or the person who is, you know, in second place, if you're in first place, that's just as good as building a building because.

634
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:29,500
Rym: But the real thing to remember is the warlord attacks a person.

635
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:30,940
Rym: Yes, like character.

636
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,480
Scott: I can't I don't say I'm going to destroy the architect's building.

637
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:36,239
Scott: I say I'm going to destroy that building in front of him.

638
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,506
Scott: That's Rims building.

639
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:39,379
Rym: that adds so much to the game.

640
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:43,059
Scott: Well, it's sort of necessary because the warlord is sort of the evener.

641
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,203
Scott: It's like, OK, if someone is getting way ahead, everyone else, you know, they have a lot of buildings.

642
00:35:48,465 --> 00:35:50,860
Scott: The warlord will come and destroy their buildings.

643
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:56,924
Scott: So it sort of keeps someone from, you know, running away with the game if no one can guess what they're taking.

644
00:35:57,044 --> 00:36:02,078
Rym: But at the same time, it also adds all these mechanics of all right, warlord, blah, blah, blah.

645
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,460
Rym: But the warlord can be assassinated.

646
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:05,560
Scott: He sure can.

647
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,860
Rym: And also, I mean, just so you understand the interplay between all the roles, you know, there's the assassin, the thief, they, you know, attack other players.

648
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:15,580
Rym: The king gets to choose first on the next round.

649
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,020
Scott: The magician gets extra cards.

650
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:20,820
Rym: The architect gets to build extra things and draw extra cards.

651
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,899
Rym: The merchant gets a shit ton of money.

652
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,939
Rym: The bishop is immune to the warlord.

653
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,879
Scott: Yeah, the warlord can't attack the bishop because he's all churchy.

654
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:30,496
Rym: The bishop, the bishop.

655
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:32,929
Rym: Ah, is that it?

656
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:33,899
Rym: No, that's not it.

657
00:36:34,763 --> 00:36:35,087
Rym: That's it.

658
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:36,080
Rym: I mean, well, that's it about the game.

659
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,179
Rym: The game is simple, fun.

660
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:45,379
Rym: I highly recommend if you're a gamer of any stripe to keep this game in your house, in your repertoire, because it's the kind of game much like also cheap.

661
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:46,343
Rym: It is.

662
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:51,744
Rym: But it's a game like Mafia where you got a group of people over and you want to entertain them.

663
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:54,619
Rym: This will entertain a crowd for hours.

664
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:55,685
Scott: Yeah, quiet.

665
00:36:55,785 --> 00:37:02,200
Scott: It's very, very popular among the nonhardcore gaming types because it's not a typical kind of game.

666
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,560
Scott: It feels like a hardcore serious game, but it's not really.

667
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:12,640
Rym: Now, the fun thing is there is an it's got a fun fantasy theme that I think it comes with it by default now, but doesn't come with every set by default.

668
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,402
Rym: So look around.

669
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:20,499
Rym: But it adds a whole alternate set of characters like the witch, the tax collector, the wizard, the abbot.

670
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,460
Scott: And the way this works is you don't just sort of mix them in with the existing ones.

671
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,224
Scott: You replace them.

672
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:28,811
Scott: So if you want to use, let's say, the witch, you have to take out what the magician.

673
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:29,219
Scott: Right.

674
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:31,199
Scott: And you put the witch in instead.

675
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,720
Scott: So it's sort of like if you're bored with the magician, you can use the witch instead.

676
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,400
Scott: If you're bored with the warlord, you can use the whatever.

677
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:45,260
Scott: I forget what the name of it is instead, you know, and it sort of spices the game up a bit, but it doesn't really change the game that much.

678
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,059
Scott: You still have sort of the same game, just crook slightly so.

679
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,460
Rym: And there's a couple of little fun things in the game.

680
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:59,540
Rym: Like there's one building that if you have it, I forget the details, but whenever someone is the king, they have to be referred to as your majesty or they're punished.

681
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:00,268
Scott: All right.

682
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:00,839
Scott: That's a good one.

683
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,580
Rym: And there's a bunch of fun things like that.

684
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,725
Rym: Then the game's really fun.

685
00:38:03,806 --> 00:38:15,239
Scott: But there's some of the buildings of special powers, but the special powers don't influence the game that much because it's the amount of those buildings cost versus what the special power gets you.

686
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,300
Scott: Now, it's just as much as a similar costing building with no special power.

687
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,739
Rym: You know what we need to point out.

688
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:29,839
Rym: Something very important is that as Scott so very obviously pointed out early on in our playing, it's a game you can cheat at.

689
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:31,940
Rym: Yes, Scott cheated.

690
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:33,199
Scott: I definitely did.

691
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:34,720
Rym: And it was brilliant.

692
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,840
Scott: OK, so here's how I cheated at this game.

693
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:37,122
Scott: Right.

694
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:39,500
Scott: So we were playing a three player game, I believe.

695
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:39,824
Scott: Right.

696
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:41,119
Rym: I think so.

697
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,436
Rym: It was like you mean Alex, me and Pete.

698
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,222
Rym: I forget.

699
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:43,625
Rym: Right.

700
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:46,600
Scott: So I had I discard, you know, I picked up the rolls.

701
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:49,020
Scott: I discarded however many I was supposed to discard.

702
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,712
Scott: I was first.

703
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:50,080
Scott: Right.

704
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,319
Scott: I looked at all the rolls in my hand.

705
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,020
Scott: I took the role I was choosing out and I passed the cards to the left.

706
00:38:57,541 --> 00:39:02,080
Scott: But I memorized what order the cards were in when I was holding them in my hand.

707
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,960
Rym: And then he just looked at what card I chose.

708
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,539
Scott: And then Rym was holding the cards.

709
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,919
Scott: He fanned them out in his hand.

710
00:39:07,321 --> 00:39:13,420
Scott: He selected one of them and then he passed them to the left without shuffling them before or after selecting one.

711
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,780
Scott: So by looking at, you know, I say, oh, he took the third one from the left.

712
00:39:17,082 --> 00:39:18,039
Scott: That's the such and such.

713
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:22,220
Scott: And then he passed it to the left and the next person also did the same thing.

714
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,580
Scott: I said, oh, he took the second one.

715
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,061
Scott: That's the such and such card, because I remembered the order of the cards because I went first.

716
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:35,200
Scott: And the solution to this is when someone passes you the hand of rolls, shuffle them up before you select one that way.

717
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:35,998
Scott: There's no way they can.

718
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,980
Rym: If you're selecting randomly, I'll just shuffle them.

719
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,960
Rym: And then behind my back, I'll select one.

720
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:41,058
Scott: Yeah, that's what I do, too.

721
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,340
Rym: But I'll point out, if you're playing this game with all your friends, just cheat.

722
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,699
Scott: Definitely cheat.

723
00:39:46,881 --> 00:39:49,800
Rym: And then but the thing is, point out that you cheated kind of early on.

724
00:39:50,082 --> 00:39:51,480
Scott: I don't even really think that's cheating.

725
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:54,004
Scott: I don't know, you're not.

726
00:39:54,406 --> 00:40:01,960
Scott: for me, cheating means you break the rules as written in the rule book, and that that doesn't break any rules written in the rule book.

727
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,583
Rym: That is true.

728
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:06,346
Rym: Thus, I recommend that you use this strategy when playing against your friends.

729
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:07,560
Scott: I also recommend it.

730
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:18,983
Scott: Another funny story from the game is that there's a rule where, see, basically when you choose the king, you get the crown and then you keep the crown until someone else uses the king.

731
00:40:19,023 --> 00:40:21,960
Scott: So if no one else uses the king, you still have the crown.

732
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,480
Scott: And as soon as someone else becomes the king, you give the crown to them.

733
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,354
Scott: And now they're in charge.

734
00:40:25,395 --> 00:40:25,578
Scott: Right.

735
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,760
Scott: But we messed up a ruling where if the king is assassinated.

736
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:32,603
Scott: Right.

737
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:35,180
Scott: Let's say I choose the king, but I get assassinated.

738
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:42,220
Scott: Well, at the end of the turn, when they find out that it was me who was the king who got assassinated, I get the crown anyway.

739
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,380
Scott: That's the correct rule.

740
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:44,999
Scott: We didn't read that rule.

741
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:52,840
Scott: So what's happening is one person took the king and kept assassinating the king and they stayed the king for the rest of the game because he messed up the rules.

742
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,108
Scott: Don't let that happen.

743
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:55,519
Scott: It makes the game really broken and stupid.

744
00:40:56,264 --> 00:40:58,200
Rym: It was actually, however, hilarious.

745
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,209
Rym: It was hilarious.

746
00:40:59,290 --> 00:40:59,998
Rym: I was on the end.

747
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:15,079
Rym: So every round, Evan would take the assassin and murder the king and every round I would take the king, hoping that in the next round he would choose either not to take the assassin or not to kill the king.

748
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,400
Rym: But Evan, being awesome, decided to always assassinate the king.

749
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:32,500
Scott: But mostly if we hadn't gotten the rule wrong and the Rym would have gotten the crown right away and then, you know, Evan would have gone, oh, and he probably wouldn't have chosen to assassinate the king if he knew the correct rule anyway.

750
00:41:33,081 --> 00:41:35,480
Rym: So, yeah, but this game is fun.

751
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,409
Rym: I highly recommend it.

752
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:37,300
Rym: Keep in your repertoire.

753
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,080
Rym: Especially if you like games like Mafia or anything like that.

754
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,098
Scott: Yeah, it's super fun.

755
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:45,980
Scott: Like it's got poison cup action.

756
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,520
Scott: It's got building stuff action.

757
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,860
Scott: It's got a little gold and it's got cards and it's got fantasy.

758
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:52,739
Scott: So it's hard to go wrong.
