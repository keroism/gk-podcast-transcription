Scott: this website working.

50
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:55,510
Rym: It's kind of like that old Foxtrot from way back.

51
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:05,525
Rym: But my mom would get up in the morning when I was in high school on like a weekend or in the summer and she'd Come down and she'd be in the kitchen She see me in the den, and she'd be like up early a and I'd be like yes.

52
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:06,930
Rym: I am up early.

53
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:08,869
Rym: I did not in fact stay up all night.

54
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,338
Rym: I used to stay up all night playing games.

55
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:15,843
Rym: Yeah, those were good days.

56
00:02:15,963 --> 00:02:17,448
Scott: No they weren't hurt the worst days.

57
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:18,170
Scott: Those were great.

58
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:20,308
Rym: It's not like I went to school.

59
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:25,642
Scott: So I played some NS today, and it was just one game of NS.

60
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:26,906
Scott: That was just so so great.

61
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,332
Scott: It's great.

62
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:30,858
Scott: I was on the aliens all right.

63
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,070
Scott: We had like two hives, but we were having trouble.

64
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,160
Scott: He couldn't really really overpower him.

65
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,170
Scott: You know it's like we tried to go into biodome.

66
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:39,697
Scott: No good, you know lately.

67
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:45,998
Rym: I've been in a lot of these not really a full stalemate But like the Marines will get outside There'll be a two hive game.

68
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:57,350
Rym: Marines are outside of one of them And they build sieges and the aliens respond by having like six gorgeous heal the thing yeah And the Marines can't quite break through and it's just a race of who can hold out longer.

69
00:02:57,852 --> 00:02:58,575
Scott: Yeah, we couldn't.

70
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:07,863
Scott: you know we had a bunch of rez, but they you know we were holding them tight and you know we pushed him back from furnace and They tried to reach out and get laser drilling.

71
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:09,110
Scott: we pushed them back over there.

72
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:18,158
Rym: I learned if you stand just like under like right inside that lava waterfall, and you do it just perfectly Skullics will jump at you and die.

73
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:20,105
Rym: yeah, and fades can't get you.

74
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:21,650
Scott: the lava waterfall is pretty fun.

75
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:29,789
Scott: In fact when we when we won the map or was it a previous iteration I don't know if it was the same game, but when we won that there was a victory jump into the lava.

76
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:34,810
Rym: I The last and as game I played the absolute last one.

77
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:44,510
Rym: I was entrusted with the one jetpack and the one GL And my job was to go around all the places where gorges were laming it up, and you flew into the lava.

78
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:45,622
Rym: I was doing fine.

79
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:52,662
Rym: for like 10 minutes I was I was kicking some ass with my jetpack and the whole time the commander's like Rym I swear to God if you die and like man.

80
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:53,164
Rym: I'm cool.

81
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:54,610
Rym: I haven't died in like 10 minutes.

82
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:01,170
Rym: I'm doing fine, and then I you know no scam around the corner, and I went ah right into that Lava.

83
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:06,062
Rym: All right, anyway, so I quit the game before the commander could yell at me.

84
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,909
Scott: Yeah, what's so?

85
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,855
Scott: where we're?

86
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:10,942
Scott: you know we're trying to.

87
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:18,601
Scott: we do like a Hive drop in bio and it goes down real quick And we got plenty of res But it's like we can't get in there to drop it.

88
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,216
Scott: so I go over there as a skulk And I poke my head.

89
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:24,740
Scott: they got one vent is welded up And I poke my head through one of the vents.

90
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:25,967
Scott: bullets come at me.

91
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:27,760
Scott: So I go to another vent.

92
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:29,009
Scott: bullets come at me.

93
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,913
Rym: So they got motion.

94
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:30,797
Rym: they see your ass.

95
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:31,359
Scott: I go to.

96
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,950
Scott: I go like one of the big open doorways bullets come at me.

97
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,782
Scott: There was like no way I could get into bio to drop this hive.

98
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:39,649
Rym: right you have sense because you could have done the slow walk way.

99
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:46,449
Scott: We had the freaking movement and defense right so we actually won before we could put the sense up.

100
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,559
Scott: So some some other people try to drop the hive.

101
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:50,342
Scott: it didn't work.

102
00:04:50,402 --> 00:04:51,766
Scott: some other people didn't work right.

103
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:56,983
Scott: so then One guy's like a days down, so I'm like this is a chance.

104
00:04:57,324 --> 00:04:57,845
Scott: so I go.

105
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,190
Scott: I'm run over to the biodome.

106
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,748
Scott: right I'm already kind of close to it because I was skulking around there anyway, and I'm waiting as a marine.

107
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:07,415
Scott: there There's no Marines gorge Running hive.

108
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,005
Scott: it was like I'm like I'm doing it.

109
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:09,770
Scott: I'm doing I'm doing it.

110
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,889
Scott: Everyone's like oh my god, and then it actually worked.

111
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:24,379
Scott: I dropped this hive and then immediately like the whole team appeared And it was like this place was covered with turrets and sieges and all sorts of nasty things that are all mechanical And within 30 seconds

112
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,946
Rym: there were like 10

113
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:31,523
Scott: bros ease Whole bunch of DC's and MC's and every mechanical thing was.

114
00:05:31,543 --> 00:05:43,670
Rym: my god general bro regard You are a credit to the service Which my proceeds man NS is making me say bro a word that I would never use in my real life.

115
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,169
Scott: I only use it to say bro see I will sometimes say Brovman's has been used.

116
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:51,624
Scott: What kind of chambers you want?

117
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:54,230
Scott: we need our tea Bronos.

118
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,240
Rym: Okay, I was eaten by a bro knows.

119
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:58,527
Scott: Yeah, I was too.

120
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:01,056
Scott: All right anyway That was good.

121
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:02,570
Scott: You mean that sounds like a good game.

122
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,687
Scott: That's one of those epic victories, especially since I dropped the hive.

123
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:06,230
Scott: that did the win.

124
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,004
Scott: It's like and I was so nervous like I'm like oh my god.

125
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:09,366
Scott: Oh my god.

126
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,728
Scott: Oh my god.

127
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,101
Scott: Oh my god Oh my god, it worked.

128
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:20,690
Rym: Oh my god I know that feeling like when I'm ninjaing a hive and I'm like alone and I see skulks like spawning Turning into lurks and flying away not noticing me and I'm like creeping behind.

129
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:22,208
Scott: Build the face.

130
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:23,332
Scott: I never do it.

131
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:24,555
Scott: I pulled it off like once.

132
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:25,757
Scott: but speaking of games that we play that are

133
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:51,789
Rym: old and awesome You know NS is pretty much the number two game, but yeah, you know that tribes too has always had this kind of insurmountable possibly rose-colored glasses Spectacle of amazing history in our view like we look back at this game And that's like the best game ever made in any genre any medium ever.

134
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:55,701
Scott: Well, uh, well greatest PC FPS.

135
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:56,343
Rym: Yeah.

136
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,810
Rym: Yeah, I guess it's a real good game.

137
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:02,970
Rym: As penny arcade said it probably accounts for a third of their total gaming memories.

138
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:04,716
Scott: Yeah, it's also.

139
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:07,947
Scott: they made like more comics about that one game probably than any other.

140
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:10,816
Scott: well, maybe Wow They made more comics about yeah.

141
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:14,568
Scott: Wow, but after Wow tribes, they've made more comics of that bang.

142
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:22,950
Rym: but Omnutia in the forums has done some research and there's a movement to bring tribes to back and it's a very tiny movement.

143
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,833
Scott: It consists of us.

144
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:33,370
Scott: if you download this file and you put it in your tribes directory Basically, you got to get tribes too, which is I guess you can get it from torrents or things like that, right?

145
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:33,811
Scott: You know what?

146
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:36,423
Scott: It's legal though because they made it free, but we've got it.

147
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:38,050
Rym: Maybe we should just host the executable.

148
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,063
Scott: Well, that's you got.

149
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:50,050
Scott: yeah Anyway, you get the file put it on libsyn and it's the patched up tribes too And then you install it and then you put this file in the tribes to folder and then you start a LAN.

150
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:59,090
Rym: Yeah, I want to play LAN single-player and if you go to a list of servers It'll show you pretty much every tribes to server that still exists and you know what?

151
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,562
Rym: There are about 70 people playing tribes too regularly.

152
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:04,465
Rym: as far as I can tell.

153
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,070
Scott: it's not really enough.

154
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:18,370
Rym: Half those people are playing on these bullshit mod servers, but half of them I played the other day Three full games of tribes on Katabatic or Katabatic, which is one of my favorite maps.

155
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:21,576
Rym: There were 20 people on each team.

156
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,224
Rym: It was the tribes that I remember.

157
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:30,506
Scott: Yeah, but it while it's the right map It's not some weird mod map and it's it is like a modded rule set.

158
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:31,610
Scott: It's not classic mode.

159
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:33,707
Scott: It's like version 2 with a lowercase V.

160
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:37,549
Rym: However, the changes as far as I could tell were minor.

161
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:46,310
Rym: one I had a tiny bit more energy than I expected and To the blaster shot twice as fast and bounced more which made it not the most useless thing in the world.

162
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,474
Scott: It's supposed to be useless.

163
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,196
Scott: That's the point of it.

164
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:49,300
Rym: No, it actually.

165
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,889
Rym: it was interesting having it actually work a little bit.

166
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,505
Rym: Yeah, you still can't take out the generators with it.

167
00:08:54,545 --> 00:08:57,329
Scott: So I don't care Blasters supposed to be useless.

168
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:10,049
Rym: Anyway, I recommend all of you who are interested in tribes to click it on this link doing what it says and Keep playing and hopefully we'll get critical mass and bring this game back.

169
00:09:10,472 --> 00:09:13,206
Scott: Yeah, one thing though is the game does feel a little bit dated.

170
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:16,577
Scott: I mean, it's like There's no voice chat built in.

171
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:25,190
Scott: Yeah, you guys everyone's doing the Shaz bots and things which is good Because that's the style of the game You play like you know, he's a voice chat like the terrain textures.

172
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,310
Rym: There's these blocky things kind of stretched over these polygons.

173
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,289
Scott: But when the game was new that like looked amazing.

174
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,103
Scott: But now it looks like poop when that game was new.

175
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:34,650
Scott: like NS looks better than that game.

176
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:39,085
Rym: I remember everyone standing around watching like the first people who got it at RIT playing it going.

177
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:41,660
Rym: Holy shit Look at those graphics.

178
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:48,251
Scott: Yeah now Waiting NS which is half-life 1 looks better than tribes 2.

179
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:52,850
Rym: However tribes 2 still has the fact that it's gigantic and it is indeed gigantic.

180
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:54,710
Rym: So plate drive - is great.

181
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,705
Scott: And now you gotta redo all my controls and relearn everything because the game is actually complicated.

182
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,490
Rym: Yeah, it's worth it though.

183
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:15,849
Rym: So I feel like if nothing else if you guys just play there and get proficient at the game with what servers there are We can have some sort of giant FRC like staged events where it's two teams that are playing ahead of time and we fight.

184
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:20,121
Rym: Maybe It'll take a while to get that thing going.

185
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,496
Scott: So don't don't think this is happening tomorrow But I just need a lot of people.

186
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:27,030
Scott: just start playing tribes - regularly lots of people.

187
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:29,354
Scott: We'll see what happens.

188
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:34,090
Rym: So anyway, you got any gaming news other than the fact that EA games are on Steam?

189
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:36,642
Scott: Yeah, so check this out.

190
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:37,790
Scott: This is crazy guy.

191
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:44,070
Scott: He's obviously a nut job and his name is Bob and he's got a company called Bob's games.

192
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:50,213
Scott: I don't know if it's the name of his company, but he made a game a DS game called Bob's game a game by one Person.

193
00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:55,808
Scott: he's apparently spent 15,000 hours of his life making a DS homebrew game.

194
00:10:56,931 --> 00:11:04,209
Scott: Whoo, he's a crazy, dude It's a complete nut job and you look at his game and his game looks like the game of a nut job.

195
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:07,023
Rym: I just got to clarify.

196
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:13,270
Rym: Is this the game of a Chiro style nut job or of a dwarf fortress Tarn Adams style nut job?

197
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,222
Rym: I don't think of what kind of that turn Adams is a nut job.

198
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:22,630
Rym: Well, not really a nut job, but there's a level of surprising and single-minded dedication.

199
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:25,237
Scott: Yeah, this guy's not these days.

200
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:26,943
Scott: He's a different kind of nut than either of those.

201
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,670
Scott: Uh-huh, but he's a nutty guy.

202
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:47,050
Scott: he spent 15,000 hours making a homebrew DS game and You know it's a top-down 2d adventure game and it's I looked at the video of it that he made and The games obviously also nutty but it's basically like an earth bound ish kind of.

203
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,510
Scott: You know, I'm not too interested in the game.

204
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:58,729
Scott: The point is is that he spent he made this game and he wants to now that the game is finished Like sell it as a real DS game, you know.

205
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:04,296
Scott: And even though I have no interest in the game and I think the guys are not Why shouldn't he?

206
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:05,624
Scott: I mean he made a DS game.

207
00:12:05,745 --> 00:12:17,715
Scott: All he needs is basically Nintendo to give him like this DVD of DS stuffs and then he can make it a real DS game and it'll be on the shelf in the store And if people buy it, he'll make money.

208
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:19,380
Scott: I seen you know, and what?

209
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,424
Scott: why shouldn't he right?

210
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:22,209
Scott: You should be allowed to do that.

211
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,769
Scott: So a pair according to him, right?

212
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:35,770
Scott: He met with Nintendo in February to ask for the SDK He teleconference them and flew to the game developers conference that a face-to-face meeting.

213
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:46,796
Scott: He went to the Wario world website Which is if people don't know like Wario world is like the name of Nintendo's developer like, you know Like division.

214
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:50,229
Scott: So if you want to make Nintendo games you talk to Wario world and they hook you up.

215
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:53,706
Scott: He talked to them and they sent him to the marketing department.

216
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:54,430
Scott: I don't know why.

217
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:56,329
Scott: That makes no sense to me.

218
00:12:57,154 --> 00:13:01,377
Scott: He talked to the marketing department and they of course said go to Wario world Which is the correct thing.

219
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,209
Scott: you go to Wario world that you buy dev kit.

220
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:12,171
Scott: So he applied at Wario world, you know filling out the application and it states that he will receive a decision in six to eight Weeks.

221
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:18,550
Scott: it has been according to him 17 weeks and he has not received a yes or a no, right?

222
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,510
Scott: He says he fulfills all the requirements.

223
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:31,250
Scott: But actually if you look at the application Nintendo has if he meets all of the like Objective requirements, but Nintendo sort of puts in some subjective ones in there.

224
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,120
Scott: So basically they can say no to ever they want, you know.

225
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,260
Scott: But they didn't say yes or no to him.

226
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,581
Scott: I mean like.

227
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:42,654
Scott: if they said no to him, I'd be like, alright They said no to him Sure.

228
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:43,258
Scott: Okay.

229
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,028
Scott: They didn't say yes or no.

230
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:57,959
Rym: so this guy being a nut job is Barricading himself in a room until that is clearly the correct course of action when such a thing is when such an Injustice has been put upon you.

231
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:07,698
Scott: He's barricading himself into a room until Nintendo lets him have the stupid dev kit so he can Sell his DS game that he spent 15,000 hours of his life making.

232
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:13,880
Scott: now This really is sort of the same situation that's going on with the iPhone, right?

233
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:24,278
Scott: You have a platform and people want to make software for the platform But there are some people making decisions as to yes or no, right you this can this is okay, and this is not okay.

234
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:28,249
Scott: now The problem here is not I mean.

235
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:35,534
Scott: ideally we would rather have just let anyone make anything They want as opposed to someone saying yes or no.

236
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:35,855
Scott: Yeah.

237
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:36,960
Rym: No, there are two extremes.

238
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:55,200
Rym: I mean on one hand there's the Nintendo seal of quality the Apple whatever but on the other hand There is the video game crash in the old days caused primarily by the fact that a million non working unplayable Amazingly awful Atari games were made flooding the market and basically destroying video games.

239
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:58,771
Scott: that's true, but look at look at more recent video game history, right.

240
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:19,359
Scott: the ps1 the ps2 the Xbox one the 360 the GBA and the DS All of those systems have had floods of terrible games that were all approved Cielo approval on those games officially licensed games floods of them floods of terrible games and it hasn't done any harm.

241
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:20,536
Scott: really You know.

242
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:28,659
Rym: I definitely think that anyone who makes actually makes the argument that if we let bad games appear on our system Then our system will collapse.

243
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:31,200
Rym: That was true a long time ago.

244
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:32,131
Rym: I really think it was.

245
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:44,599
Rym: but nowadays With the wide access to development tools and programming tools and game design and publishing and all that stuff homebrew and I guess indie games is really where it's at.

246
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:47,720
Scott: Yeah, and in addition to that, right?

247
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,920
Scott: You've got I don't mind if they like Nintendo seal of quality used to mean we check it for bugs, right?

248
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Scott: It's like we don't want you to put any buggy crap on here.

249
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,240
Scott: That's not gonna work, you know, because then someone says titty bucks in a Nintendo game and it doesn't work.

250
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,685
Scott: We're not gonna let that happen.

251
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:06,320
Scott: All right, and the thing is it doesn't even mean that anymore.

252
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,726
Scott: I mean that Zelda game.

253
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:08,529
Scott: there was a problem.

254
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:13,135
Scott: if you saved in the wrong spot you were you're fucked you're done, you know.

255
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:13,579
Scott: and there was.

256
00:16:14,782 --> 00:16:18,740
Scott: There was a DS bubbly bubbly bus to move game where it just couldn't be beaten.

257
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:20,739
Scott: It was buggy and crashy all over the place.

258
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:31,220
Scott: So even now it's like if you're gonna pick and choose which games are gonna say yes to and which you're gonna say no to Then I expect there to not be floods of crap.

259
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:32,629
Scott: I expect you to not.

260
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:38,595
Scott: nothing should have a bug on it Everything should be perfect and nothing should be crappy or in the very least.

261
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:49,454
Rym: I would even be okay With them just having a clear objective list of what will and will not allow a game to be approved Instead of it being ambiguous like you don't know what's going to be improved or not.

262
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:55,113
Rym: and if they gave clear Prompt answers as to yes or no, and if no then why?

263
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:57,180
Scott: yeah, I mean look at the iPhone, right?

264
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,759
Scott: You have people saying yes or no, right?

265
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:07,157
Scott: But there are some things that violate the rules as Listed and there are some things that were rejected without violating any rules according to some.

266
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:13,800
Scott: you know Interpretations of such and you look at the App Store floods of crap floods and floods of crap.

267
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:17,012
Scott: So it's like if what the fuck is going on with these people.

268
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:24,396
Rym: the main thing I want what really bothers me Is that I look at my DS and I hardly ever play it anymore because I've already played.

269
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:28,278
Rym: like every good game That's out there other than a few that I know we're good as haven't gotten to.

270
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:33,159
Rym: but What new great games are coming on the DS in the next, you know, six months to a year?

271
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,876
Scott: Hopefully something let's see.

272
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:40,540
Scott: Waiting for the fucking fire emblem that I think is already out in Japan.

273
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,027
Scott: Where is it in the US people?

274
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,233
Scott: or fire emblem DS?

275
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:43,655
Scott: Step it up.

276
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:44,780
Rym: another advanced wars.

277
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:48,033
Rym: I've already gotten an ass in everything in the current advanced wars.

278
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:49,680
Rym: I need a new advanced wars.

279
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,246
Rym: I'll pay a lot of money for it.

280
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:51,969
Scott: I'm gonna get.

281
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,953
Scott: I'm waiting for the fire.

282
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:56,300
Scott: I guess chrono trigger just came out anyway.

283
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:02,695
Rym: There is other gaming news and I believe we should mention it being a gaming podcast right now.

284
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:03,758
Rym: gaming night show.

285
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:13,419
Rym: but uh EA games on steam and I think I can sum that up in a very short interesting phrase Too little too late.

286
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:19,360
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know spore was having a lot of the EA games especially spore.

287
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,519
Scott: We get all this flack for their DRM, right?

288
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:26,959
Scott: So they put their PC games on steam now, but now those games are already old.

289
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:31,573
Scott: So it's like you think that now you put them on steam which has DRM.

290
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,840
Scott: the gamers accept and don't care about that.

291
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:36,500
Scott: Suddenly people bunch more people are gonna buy spore.

292
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:41,343
Scott: I mean, I guess some people buy it but not you know it's not gonna.

293
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:51,360
Scott: the numbers are not gonna look good on EA's end and I Think that they might you know either turn around on this or just sort of lazily go about it.

294
00:18:51,520 --> 00:19:01,800
Scott: But I think if they stick with it and they put out like the next new game on steam right away Like when it's brand new then they'll see the sales on it and they'll go.

295
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,600
Rym: Yeah, it's hard to say.

296
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Rym: I mean Maybe this is one of those situations where they're doing it people have suggested this on the internet or of course Everything is true that maybe EA is doing this now with the games.

297
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,677
Rym: They're doing so that when they don't sell well, they can use that as an excuse to say.

298
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:18,580
Rym: Well, well fuck that.

299
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:22,500
Rym: Yeah, maybe companies have done things like that in the past.

300
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:33,140
Scott: I don't know if yeah I mean you do something that you know Will fail because you want it to fail and then you point out that it failed but you set it up to fail and it Wouldn't have failed if you would have done it properly.

301
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,128
Rym: Perhaps perhaps I mean, I don't know.

302
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:39,440
Rym: I'm not interested in most of the games EA has to offer anyway.

303
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:40,820
Rym: So it doesn't really affect me as a gamer.

304
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:48,393
Rym: I mean in the end I would rather if every game I bought was just on steam because For all the problems team has it's the.

305
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:53,680
Rym: it's basically the Apple iTunes store of gaming as in it's the best one.

306
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:54,866
Rym: It just works.

307
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:57,540
Rym: the DRM doesn't really get in your way unless you're doing something stupid.

308
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,940
Scott: You know how to worry about losing your CDs or DVDs or anything like that or CD keys?

309
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,570
Scott: Oh my god game you have ever is always there.

310
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:13,680
Rym: always the fact that when I bought my new laptop I put steam on it and I just clicked on all the games I own that I also wanted to be on the laptop and now they're all there and they work.

311
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:17,392
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know all these other DRMs, you know, fuck you.

312
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:19,740
Scott: You can't install your games on every system.

313
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,168
Scott: This DRM on the steam games.

314
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:27,039
Scott: It's you can't give the games to your friends, you know, but you know what?

315
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,471
Scott: No other limitation on it that gets in your way at all.

316
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:36,791
Scott: You can install it in as many systems as you want Then you can play it.

317
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,019
Scott: every works every time.

318
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:42,279
Scott: It's never a situation where you want to play your game when you can't or you want to install it and you can't.

319
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,788
Scott: So it's like the DRM is not even there.

320
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:50,268
Scott: I mean even the iTunes store has DRM that gets in your way You know, oh I bought 10 max.

321
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,417
Scott: I want to listen to my music and all 10 max.

322
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,123
Scott: Sorry It's not gonna happen.

323
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:59,100
Scott: you get there's like a limit of so many and it's you know, you gotta rip the DRM as bullshit.

324
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:01,431
Rym: Yep, so we'll see what happens with this.

325
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:02,818
Rym: I don't really have any predictions.

326
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:04,606
Rym: either way I mean, I don't know.

327
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:08,320
Rym: I don't know if anyone even cares about crisis anymore.

328
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,751
Rym: Like do people still play that game see that gay crisis?

329
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:14,640
Scott: like who actually plays crisis or cares about it?

330
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,300
Scott: It's something that just people who like to overclock their PCs get so they can show how many FPS is are there?

331
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:21,819
Scott: It's not actually a game people play.

332
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:22,662
Scott: I don't know.

333
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:32,260
Scott: maybe PC gaming history ever since quite you know quake one has been filled with plenty of games like that where the Games existed not to be played because they were terrible to play.

334
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:41,940
Scott: They just existed to push the video card as hard as possible to show off all the fancy graphics That Nvidia and ATI could make more money, but maybe it's not terrible to play.

335
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,719
Rym: I mean, I haven't played it.

336
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:49,959
Scott: I can't say the company that makes the game makes a bunch of money because now everyone who wants to test out their Nvidia's and ATI's will buy that game to test it out.

337
00:21:50,181 --> 00:21:54,075
Rym: But most of the people who care about overclocking also don't care about pirating.

338
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:55,783
Scott: I Don't know.

339
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:57,360
Rym: Yeah, I don't know either.

340
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:01,560
Rym: I don't know if I honestly do not know if crisis was a good game or not.

341
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,779
Scott: I played the demo of it and it was an FPS reshoot.

342
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:08,092
Rym: shit You know, I feel sadly like that.

343
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:12,915
Rym: that's the review I have for a lot of games that have come out in the reason recent memory.

344
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,220
Rym: It's an FPS.

345
00:22:15,428 --> 00:22:18,239
Scott: Yeah Nothing special to write home about.

346
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:20,648
Rym: It's no try if you want.

347
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:21,412
Scott: It's no NS.

348
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:22,940
Scott: You want me to write home about your game?

349
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,440
Scott: You gotta be more than just another FPS.

350
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:32,119
Rym: You got it, you know writing home is perhaps not the best analogy because I don't think my parents even really understand to this day What kind of games I play?

351
00:22:39,073 --> 00:22:40,822
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

352
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:42,029
Rym: I got two quickies here.

353
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:49,421
Rym: Quickie number one Voldo and Voldo dressed up as Michael Jackson Dancing to smooth criminal.

354
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:52,575
Rym: All right This was on Kotaku.

355
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:54,241
Scott: This is the people know plays Voldo.

356
00:22:54,743 --> 00:22:56,610
Rym: You know, I hate that fact.

357
00:22:56,691 --> 00:22:57,677
Rym: It's one of those like.

358
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,670
Rym: it's something that kind of bothers me.

359
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:06,090
Rym: But I remember I always played like Siegfried when I've been playing Siegfried since soul edge.

360
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:07,474
Scott: That's how awesome I am.

361
00:23:07,915 --> 00:23:09,259
Scott: but Siegfried slash nightmare.

362
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,225
Rym: I always avoided characters like Voldo.

363
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:12,710
Rym: I never liked playing ugly characters.

364
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,926
Rym: I always play either of a shown any looking guy or a girl like in Street Fighter.

365
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:18,789
Rym: I always played you and Lee.

366
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,515
Rym: Yeah, yeah, she's not bad.

367
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:22,759
Scott: I was always M bison.

368
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:26,090
Rym: Ah, you see I always avoided him bison cuz it felt cheap.

369
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:27,255
Scott: No, it's not cheap.

370
00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:27,818
Scott: It's awesome.

371
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:28,863
Scott: You get the slide.

372
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:30,229
Scott: Let's get the psycho crusher.

373
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:37,508
Scott: Oh, he's got the step on your head move and in the later ones He's got the jump up in the air and drop his hand on the back of your head.

374
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:45,078
Scott: move As a good moves, but anyway one day plus when he punches his fist is on fire But psychic fire.

375
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:59,250
Rym: when we had Soul Calibur 2 at RIT We were all playing passing it around and I started playing random characters just for fun And I ended up on Voldo and I started winning a lot and I realized over time that I'm naturally good with Voldo.

376
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,921
Rym: Voldo is my natural Soul Calibur, buddy.

377
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:10,508
Rym: Yeah, I Feel sick about that fact, but at the same time I would rather win shamefully than lose.

378
00:24:13,013 --> 00:24:15,609
Rym: So I always play Voldo now and I'm really good as Voldo.

379
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,038
Rym: Yeah, but I don't know.

380
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:23,095
Rym: Voldo and Michael Jackson seem to have this sort of Association in my mind.

381
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,843
Rym: So when I saw this video it just fit.

382
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:27,148
Rym: I don't know what else.

383
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:27,730
Rym: I can say.

384
00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:31,885
Rym: It's a pretty good video - I'll admit I started laughing toward the end.

385
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:33,110
Rym: It starts getting really crazy.

386
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:34,740
Scott: Yeah, it's like in the beginning.

387
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,769
Scott: It starts to get a little long in the tooth But then they sort of do more goods.

388
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:46,137
Rym: So but number two, I have to mention this the World of Warcraft Mouse for $100 $100 Mouse.

389
00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:54,490
Scott: $100 I mean like $400 you can get like the best logic Mouse in the universe $100 World of Warcraft Mouse.

390
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,695
Scott: So anyway, does it have like?

391
00:24:56,036 --> 00:25:01,316
Scott: let me guess if you just hold down the mouse button It actually clicks repeatedly for you.

392
00:25:01,678 --> 00:25:04,347
Scott: Well, so you can use it for Diablo 2 as well.

393
00:25:04,427 --> 00:25:05,330
Rym: Well, it's funny.

394
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:12,990
Rym: You should ask that because if you read down at the review the last positive note here quote works like a charm.

395
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:20,550
Rym: I'm just going to read this verbatim because this says More than anything what it is that I hate about the World of Warcraft.

396
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:30,047
Rym: Alright after a slight struggle getting my fingers used to the strange button configuration I found that I could completely change the way I played the game using the wild gaming mouse.

397
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:43,650
Rym: I Was never big on macros previously, but now I cannot imagine living without them Especially on my priest who can now cast healing on any member of the party with one click of the assigned button

398
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:44,573
Scott: While

399
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:51,190
Rym: it is nothing new for players who have already modified the hell out of their UI and set up 200 macros in the game for every possible spell and ability.

400
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:57,749
Rym: For a guy like me who's pretty much relied on the tools blizzard has given me in the past four years It makes a big difference.

401
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,162
Rym: If macros make that much of a difference the game is broken.

402
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:03,126
Rym: Oh my god.

403
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:03,507
Rym: I'm done.

404
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:04,170
Rym: That's all I got to say.

405
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:05,819
Rym: That's all I've got to say.

406
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:07,630
Scott: Yeah, I mean, what is a macro?

407
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:20,689
Scott: it is a tiny program that you know, basically allows the user to put in a more simple input in the place of a complex input and Thus the complex input was simple to begin with and a computer in it.

408
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,090
Scott: I'm not even gonna go down this road.

409
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:28,650
Rym: All I want to say is if macros like that or they are allowed then why isn't my macro that?

410
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,044
Rym: Walks out to the spot and kills monsters for an hour allowed.

411
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:34,470
Scott: Yeah, exactly, right?

412
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:37,043
Rym: Anyway, I don't have anything else to say.

413
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,430
Rym: I'm not gonna rag on Wow anymore.

414
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:40,166
Rym: I think everyone knows how I feel about it.

415
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:53,250
Rym: Though my boss showed me an interesting article about how IT recruiters if they will basically tell new people who are getting sent out Not to mention that they play Wow because apparently there's a big backlash among IT hiring.

416
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,124
Scott: Well, because originally people were saying yes, but I guess now they're saying no, which is good.

417
00:26:57,385 --> 00:26:58,670
Rym: Yeah, I could talk more about that.

418
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,835
Rym: I'll talk about it on Monday.

419
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:03,310
Scott: Anyway, alright, so here's this cool video this guy took.

420
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:07,229
Scott: You know, I'm doing some Arduino actions, right?

421
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,734
Scott: Programmable electronics.

422
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:12,603
Scott: I actually saw the soldered the board.

423
00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:13,927
Scott: It was actually.

424
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:14,830
Scott: it worked really well.

425
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,627
Scott: It's pronounced solder not in Australia, and I did a very good job of it.

426
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:23,289
Scott: Nevertheless It's pretty did a very good job of it.

427
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,481
Scott: It actually worked and I was very proud.

428
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:34,339
Scott: but so I'm looking for like, you know Mostly like electron simple electronic toys to you know interface with because that's how you get started with this action But also making it fun.

429
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:42,708
Scott: and this guy here He's got eight R2D2s, right that I think these are program like supposed to be programmable R2D2s.

430
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:43,911
Scott: you know, it's.

431
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:46,820
Scott: it's like you didn't hack them or anything.

432
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:50,049
Scott: and he programmed them all to do a gay gay dance.

433
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:54,221
Scott: and He's got 16 of them lined up and he has them all.

434
00:27:54,302 --> 00:27:56,210
Scott: do the gay gay dance simultaneously.

435
00:27:57,531 --> 00:27:58,233
Rym: It's beautiful.

436
00:27:58,454 --> 00:27:59,899
Scott: It is a work of art.

437
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,330
Scott: And I just want to remind you it's a little Star Wars thing of the day.

438
00:28:03,694 --> 00:28:04,749
Scott: It is the holiday season.

439
00:28:05,592 --> 00:28:16,637
Scott: Everyone should remember Celebrate.

440
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:19,429
Scott: I Don't know if every geek out there knows this.

441
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:23,943
Scott: This is something that everyone should know but not everyone necessarily knows.

442
00:28:24,024 --> 00:28:40,592
Rym: there are only three reactions to this Depending on what kind of person you are either the I already know about this reaction the falling to the ground Into the fetal position reaction or the there's more Star Wars Reaction.

443
00:28:40,672 --> 00:28:47,694
Scott: Yeah, if you did not know I hope most of you know this already there is and was in the 70s I think late 70s.

444
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:49,101
Scott: I don't remember the exact year.

445
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:52,256
Scott: There was a Star Wars Christmas special.

446
00:28:52,336 --> 00:28:55,352
Scott: it was the real deal made by Lucas, you know Everyone.

447
00:28:55,473 --> 00:28:56,863
Scott: all the characters are in it.

448
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:57,789
Scott: the bookies are in.

449
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:59,514
Rym: it Worked at IBM.

450
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:05,750
Rym: the eunuch Santa gave that as a secret Santa gift on DVD to my boss.

451
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:10,885
Rym: Oh my god, and basically all the nerds in the department go.

452
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:15,402
Rym: Oh And she goes I didn't see this Star Wars movie.

453
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,145
Rym: Is it any good?

454
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:17,650
Rym: and she looks up having no idea.

455
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:24,180
Scott: If you have not seen or heard of these Star Wars Christmas special just you know.

456
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:32,410
Rym: when we got back after New Year We were sitting in his office talking and she walked up to the door threw the DVD at him and walked away without a word.

457
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:43,130
Scott: You need to see it because if you are a geek that is something you need to know about and have seen.

458
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,038
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

459
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:45,680
Rym: You know what?

460
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:47,789
Rym: I don't know if you should see it.

461
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,732
Scott: No, every.

462
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:54,130
Scott: you can't call yourself a geek slash nerd if you have not known about and seen the Star Wars.

463
00:29:54,453 --> 00:30:05,519
Rym: But I warn you this holidays It's kind of like no kung-fu master Can truly call themselves a kung-fu master if they didn't spend that month Punching that brick or whatever.

464
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:11,543
Rym: it is that the kung-fu people exactly exactly Punching that bag of sand breaking your arm on the whatever.

465
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:11,783
Rym: Yep.

466
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:12,125
Scott: Yep.

467
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:12,345
Scott: Yep.

468
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:13,148
Scott: That's you gotta do.

469
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:19,509
Rym: however Breaking your arm on the whatever is what watching the Star Wars but like you might think it'll be funny.

470
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:27,909
Rym: You might think if you have lots of drugs Available you might even imagine that you could sit around with your friends and make fun of it.

471
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:29,275
Scott: The thing is the amount of.

472
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:33,550
Scott: I don't do any of the drugs, you know this but not even the alcohols and the tobaccos.

473
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:38,800
Rym: Scott Like half a teaspoon of rum once just to see what it tasted like.

474
00:30:38,821 --> 00:30:39,302
Scott: it was bad.

475
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:41,248
Scott: It tasted like medicine.

476
00:30:41,268 --> 00:30:41,870
Scott: It was bad.

477
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:54,919
Scott: if if you Want to make you know, the Star Wars holiday special good by you know with some mind-altering substances Not LSD because you'll never recover.

478
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:56,927
Scott: the amount of mind-altering substances.

479
00:30:56,947 --> 00:31:05,210
Scott: You'll have to Use in order to make it enjoyable is so great that you will not actually end up watching it.

480
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:11,344
Scott: You will end up simply, you know Having your mind occupied by the substances and the and the wall.

481
00:31:11,364 --> 00:31:13,029
Scott: the TV will not come into play at all.

482
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,794
Rym: I'll say one thing What if you have not seen it?

483
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:22,787
Rym: once you have seen it the prequels to Star Wars are suddenly citizen Kane.

484
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:26,486
Scott: Yeah You need to know about it and watch it.

485
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:32,461
Rym: That's awesome Right, so I can't believe we haven't talked about this like I.

486
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:37,138
Scott: it's one of those things where let me check one more time To make sure we talk about even.

487
00:31:37,198 --> 00:31:38,223
Scott: I'm pretty sure we did not.

488
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:39,730
Rym: it's one of those things where we're sitting around.

489
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,377
Rym: We're like, what are we gonna do Tuesday show on?

490
00:31:41,397 --> 00:31:42,200

00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:42,883
Rym: and ass?

492
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:43,586
Rym: What do you been playing?

Rym: Gregola, yeah, great.

495
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:47,697
Rym: What are we gonna do?

496
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:48,540
Rym: the freaking show on?

497
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:51,370
Rym: and then I'm like, hey, wait a minute New Year's is coming up.

498
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:58,925
Rym: Let's uh, we'll have the annual game of this because it can only be played once a year Or you'll never be friends with your friends again.

499
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:01,944
Scott: Yeah But that's sort of just a joke.

500
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:02,810
Scott: I don't know how true it is.

501
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,661
Scott: I could actually play this game quite a few times.

502
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:24,548
Rym: I could too but the game is One of those games where if you're let's I'll put it this way if your friend group is on tenuous grounds Anyway, or if there are people in your wide group of friends who take games personally You cannot play this game more than once a year once a year or you will not be friends with those.

503
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:25,934
Scott: even once a year Might be too much.

504
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:28,324
Scott: But you know for people like us we could play it more.

505
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:28,947
Scott: We just don't.

506
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:29,530
Rym: yeah.

507
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:37,620
Rym: Well, we can only play it once a year for other reasons because the first half of playing the game again is oh, yeah I remember this game.

508
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:45,429
Scott: No, the second half is oh, yeah I remember if you play it too often that first half doesn't exist anymore because you remember the game.

509
00:32:47,072 --> 00:32:53,252
Scott: So the game is Illuminati in by Steve Jackson in 1981.

510
00:32:53,252 --> 00:32:55,458
Scott: I was negative one years old.

511
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,427
Rym: the game didn't actually come out until 1982 in July.

512
00:32:58,447 --> 00:32:59,630
Scott: I was zero years old.

513
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:03,984
Rym: I had been alive for quite some time for almost six months.

514
00:33:04,045 --> 00:33:09,638
Scott: in July you said yes Hey So I was at two and something months old.

515
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:13,290
Rym: I was six and something months old being the elder GeekNights.

516
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:16,165
Scott: Oh, no, it's the elder GeekNights.

517
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:18,955
Rym: four months It's a long time.

518
00:33:18,975 --> 00:33:20,983
Rym: No, not really to a fish fly.

519
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:28,462
Rym: Yeah, maybe a moth goldfish In dog months.

520
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:37,343
Rym: anyway Illuminati the game is Based nominally on the illuminatus trilogy in terms of style.

521
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:39,770
Rym: I'm not going to talk about the illuminatus trilogy.

522
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,913
Rym: We're not going to bring that up.

523
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:42,858
Rym: That is a show unto itself.

524
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,247
Rym: I should have made that my my book club.

525
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:47,874
Scott: I Had to read it.

526
00:33:48,437 --> 00:33:49,162
Rym: You've never read it.

527
00:33:49,383 --> 00:33:53,504
Rym: No, it's uh Rambling is one way to put it.

528
00:33:53,827 --> 00:33:57,894
Rym: Yeah incoherently hilarious Awesome.

529
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,370
Rym: I don't know but we're not gonna talk about it.

530
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:07,132
Rym: We're talking about illuminati a card game by Steve Jackson and Steve Jackson games It is.

531
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:17,310
Rym: it is a game that if you consider yourself a gamer that and your game your definition of gaming involves pens papers dice boards non-computers.

532
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:20,880
Rym: You have to have played the Illuminati game at some point.

533
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,288
Scott: I mean if you're one of those he was playing munchkin.

534
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:27,626
Scott: now You got to realize Illuminati was what munchkin came out of.

535
00:34:27,647 --> 00:34:40,850
Rym: I mean Illuminati is one of those games where it's not the best game in the world by any stretch But it has game mechanics that will be novel to the majority of gamers out there and also the cards are humorous.

536
00:34:41,572 --> 00:34:43,516
Rym: Yes, you see there are two elements to this game.

537
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,324
Rym: the theme and style alone.

538
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:56,310
Rym: if you had never played the game before Playing it as a group of friends without reading through the cards Will provide half the entertainment this game has to offer already.

539
00:34:56,411 --> 00:35:01,150
Scott: Yeah, cuz all the interesting cards that come up It's like you turn over new cards every turn and you turn over a new one.

540
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,049
Scott: You never seen it before you go.

541
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:02,933
Rym: Oh my god, lol.

542
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:12,490
Rym: the first time I turned over the smoth and I read what the smoth was And I realized that I knew people who were in fact that kind of person.

543
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:16,403
Scott: I like the orbital space lasers orbital mind control lasers.

544
00:35:16,463 --> 00:35:17,045
Scott: That's right.

545
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:18,650
Rym: Everyone wants to play him.

546
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,842
Rym: No one ever does because everyone's fighting over him.

547
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:22,230
Scott: Yeah, it's how it goes.

548
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,250
Rym: Illuminati is a game that simulates Illuminati.

549
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:32,010
Scott: Yeah, it basically simulates a worldwide conspiracy of organizations.

550
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:34,080
Scott: You know you start with this one.

551
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,110
Scott: every player gets an organization, right?

552
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:43,194
Scott: so someone's the gnomes someone's the Illuminati someone's the network someone's the The search Church of the subgenius.

553
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:44,316
Rym: now remember they're all.

554
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:51,675
Rym: basically they're all based on quote unquote real world Illuminati Conspiracy group.

555
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:55,630
Scott: the Church of the subgenius is real the Illuminati is real the network is real.

556
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,361
Rym: The gnomes of Zurich are definitely real.

557
00:35:58,401 --> 00:36:00,350
Scott: I mean, I don't know what part is not real.

558
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:12,496
Rym: basically, it's a game, you know Twilight struggle is a game where what if the kind of Doctrine of the Cold War like the domino theory and all that BS was true Like really real?

559
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:14,603
Rym: then this game simulates the real world.

560
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:20,407
Rym: the Illuminati game Assumes that all the conspiracy theories in the world are real.

561
00:36:21,492 --> 00:36:22,816
Rym: Yeah, and they're all competing.

562
00:36:22,836 --> 00:36:24,682
Scott: so you start with this one group.

563
00:36:24,903 --> 00:36:26,910
Scott: right and there are groups on the board.

564
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,965
Scott: You know every card is a group, you know some group on of people on the earth.

565
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:39,874
Scott: You might get newspapers You might get I don't know evangelicals or I try to remember rockers Psychiatrists.

566
00:36:39,894 --> 00:36:42,349
Scott: you got a list of cards the city of New York.

567
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:43,593
Scott: That's good.

568
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:48,730
Scott: Cuz I don't remember too many cards the KKK the KGB Girly magazine.

569
00:36:49,593 --> 00:36:50,788
Scott: Girly magazine is a great card.

570
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:54,687
Scott: See all these cards and you control the cards, right?

571
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:55,450
Scott: You take them over.

572
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,864
Scott: So you got you know, the I'm the slam the Bavarian Illuminati.

573
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,230
Scott: I take over the girly magazines.

574
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,690
Scott: Well, now the conspiracy is the girly magazines are actually run by the Bavarian Illuminati.

575
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:08,149
Scott: They're infecting the minds of all them the perverted men.

576
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:15,981
Rym: But then you can use cards to take over other cards and you'll build this chain where you have cards Hanging off of your main Illuminati from other cards.

577
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:18,050
Rym: you have the best conspiracy network.

578
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:27,130
Scott: Yep, so it's like, you know, the Illuminati controls the girly magazines controls the newspapers controls the orbital space lasers You know, so it's like orbital mind control lasers.

579
00:37:27,652 --> 00:37:30,927
Scott: So it's like oh man, the newspapers are controlling our minds in.

580
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:34,333
Scott: you know all for the girly magazines all for the Illuminati.

581
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:48,763
Scott: and then you make this web that goes out in different directions of things all linked together and you try to build a bigger Network than the other people and you also in addition to building a big network you attack and defend the other players networks directly.

582
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:54,310
Rym: now Here's the meat of this game because that you know that that mechanic is in and of itself.

583
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:55,930
Rym: Not many games have used it effectively.

584
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:58,780
Rym: This game actually uses it better than a lot of games has.

585
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,750
Rym: this game was very revolutionary in a lot of ways.

586
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:09,150
Rym: But the meat of the game is that victory conditions are symmetric in one way and asymmetric in another way.

587
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:10,975
Rym: There's a base victory condition.

588
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:17,135
Rym: if you have X things connected to your thing at the end of a turtle at any point You win immediately game over.

589
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:17,316
Scott: Yep.

590
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:20,450
Scott: Your network is this big depending on the number of players you win.

591
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:20,932
Scott: You have.

592
00:38:20,972 --> 00:38:22,338
Scott: you don't say 10 you win.

593
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:26,329
Rym: Congratulations, but there are two more important mechanics.

594
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:30,945
Rym: Number one every player has a second victory condition.

595
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:33,849
Rym: For example, if I'm the UFOs Well, that's not a good example.

596
00:38:34,254 --> 00:38:40,622
Rym: Actually the gnomes Ever have a certain amount of money on their home base mega bucks.

597
00:38:40,963 --> 00:38:43,150
Rym: Yes, they win immediately game over.

598
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:45,699
Scott: So let's say right on the gnomes.

599
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:50,338
Scott: I've got one group, but I've got a bajillion dollars I win and that's it.

600
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:51,262
Scott: game over game over.

601
00:38:51,423 --> 00:38:56,103
Rym: So everyone has these two Goals to strive for and you only need one of the goals.

602
00:38:56,143 --> 00:38:57,670
Scott: you can ignore one and go for the other.

603
00:38:58,093 --> 00:39:02,919
Scott: But really you all if you want to get chief your goal You're gonna need more groups to do it not less.

604
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:05,248
Scott: less groups is not gonna help you towards your goal.

605
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:16,877
Rym: now Here's part number three and then pursuant to that part number four part Number three is that you can help and hinder other players Directly with money and other influence.

606
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:17,539
Rym: Yeah, of course the game.

607
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:24,549
Rym: So say I'm trying to take the Robot sea monsters away from our friend Luke.

608
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:30,530
Rym: All right And Scott is mad at Luke for whatever reason and Scott decides that he wants this to happen.

609
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:40,089
Rym: I put my money in and I'm making my attack and we keep going around the table and people can take turns tossing in money to help either side.

610
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:44,145
Rym: So this Scott starts tossing in money to back me because he wants Luke to get fucked.

611
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:45,430
Rym: so then he can fuck Luke further.

612
00:39:45,972 --> 00:39:47,598
Rym: But then Pete says you know what?

613
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,850
Rym: I don't want Luke to get fucked because that makes room and Scott way too powerful.

614
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:52,128
Rym: So I'm gonna start backing Luke.

615
00:39:52,911 --> 00:40:03,573
Scott: Yep, so the way everyone has all this money and you have your money like, you know dispersed throughout your network You know and if you disperse your money throughout your network properly, it keeps it strong You know because money.

616
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:08,110
Scott: if you give money to a group it helps that group out and attack and defense, you know.

617
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:14,508
Scott: but you can keep most of your money in the central area where you can sort of spread it around as need be right.

618
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:24,498
Scott: and When you attack, you know, you use money to boost your attacking and other people, you know When you attack them use money to defend.

619
00:40:24,518 --> 00:40:29,409
Scott: and but of course even if you're not involved in a fight You can put money in one side or the other.

620
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:43,172
Scott: so When someone actually fights someone or even just tries to pick up a new group off the table all Every single person on the board like throws money at it to try to make it happen or just not put any money to let It happen.

621
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,989
Scott: So you look like the gnomes who can win by having the most money, right?

622
00:40:48,131 --> 00:40:58,963
Rym: They're real stingy and they try to keep all their money But at the same time they might have to intervene like say I'm about to win I have what like I need one more control of something and I win.

623
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:01,270
Rym: so I attack this low-hanging fruit somewhere.

624
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:06,627
Rym: Basically everyone in the game has to gang up on me or else I win in the game's over.

625
00:41:06,888 --> 00:41:07,510
Scott: I'm the gnomes.

626
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:09,659
Scott: I don't want to put in that much money.

627
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:11,808
Scott: I want to put in just enough to keep him from winning.

628
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:18,127
Scott: but Everyone knows I'm the gnomes and that I'm hoarding money and that I have the most money and I'm loaded.

629
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:19,777
Scott: so they're gonna say I'm Not putting anything in.

630
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,274
Scott: you gnomes you do it All this money.

631
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:34,307
Rym: while Twilight struggle was supposed to be a game of brinksmanship Illuminati is a game of brinksmanship where Scott's about to win and Pete has a lot of money and Emily has a lot of money and I have a lot of money.

632
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:35,511
Rym: and I said You know what?

633
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:36,434
Rym: Fuck it.

634
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:37,939
Rym: I'm not putting in shit.

635
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:40,587
Rym: either you guys put up or peaches gonna win and the game's over.

636
00:41:40,607 --> 00:41:45,369
Rym: Yep, and The brinksmanship gets epic.

637
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,228
Scott: But Danny if it actually comes down to the line and no one else puts the money in you go off fucking.

638
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:50,061
Scott: I have to Put the money.

639
00:41:50,082 --> 00:41:58,163
Rym: Yeah And be out that people make deals with each other like tell you what I'll fuck Pete now But you have to promise to fuck him next round when he tries this shit again.

640
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:58,805
Rym: Yep.

641
00:41:58,845 --> 00:41:59,910
Scott: Cheating is also legal.

642
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:00,753
Rym: Well, no, there's.

643
00:42:01,034 --> 00:42:05,790
Rym: there is the cheating rules and you know cheating rules because if you just cheat it's stupid.

644
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:14,089
Rym: But if you play by the cheating rules, there's like you're allowed to cheat at certain things But not at other things and it makes the game really fun.

645
00:42:15,094 --> 00:42:18,036
Rym: Of course, it breaks the game too if you're good And basically the rule aid.

646
00:42:18,116 --> 00:42:21,730
Scott: the cheating rules are like if you get caught you're fucked, but if you don't get caught it's okay.

647
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:24,299
Rym: Yeah, but there's certain things you can't cheat at.

648
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:25,544
Rym: Otherwise, it's just stupid.

649
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:32,814
Rym: Yeah Yeah, like when you're taking your income if you just take like a bunch of 50s and it's hiding in your network It's stupid.

650
00:42:32,854 --> 00:42:36,878
Scott: Yeah, cuz you keep all your money upside down so no one can see it But you don't have to.

651
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,510
Rym: that's another cool thing about this game.

652
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:48,630
Rym: you have the choice always of having your money be open or not open as Then you can just put it face up on your thing or face down and you can control the pile and moves.

653
00:42:48,671 --> 00:42:57,540
Scott: Yeah If you keep if you use for example a pile of all ones you can make it look like you have a really big pile Unless people are really paying attention if nobody's counting your money.

654
00:42:58,163 --> 00:43:00,270
Scott: They don't know how much you really got under there.

655
00:43:00,552 --> 00:43:02,549
Scott: Is it just a big intimidating pile of ones?

656
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:06,503
Scott: I mean I could put like two 100s and then like ten ones.

657
00:43:06,965 --> 00:43:08,230
Scott: and so you think I got a lot.

658
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:09,630
Scott: But you maybe think I'm hiding it.

659
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,433
Scott: But actually I have a lot.

660
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:14,993
Rym: also like money on a thing is worth more in the defense of it than it is if it's From somewhere else.

661
00:43:15,033 --> 00:43:19,390
Rym: So say I have a thing I really want to keep or I I really don't want anyone to attack it.

662
00:43:19,853 --> 00:43:21,830
Rym: Maybe I put a bunch of money on it face up.

663
00:43:21,991 --> 00:43:23,808
Rym: So I got 30 money face up on it.

664
00:43:24,191 --> 00:43:26,884
Rym: Everyone can look at that and know there's no way in hell.

665
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:27,969
Rym: they can take it away from me.

666
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,538
Scott: Yep, don't even try try something else instead.

667
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,250
Rym: Yep, but uh, here's the thing that makes this get that.

668
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,929
Rym: This is what makes the game.

669
00:43:37,313 --> 00:43:44,800
Rym: if multiple people Make their victory condition simultaneously They all win right?

670
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,286
Scott: So for example, right?

671
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:49,255
Scott: Let's say Let's use the gnomes cuz.

672
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:50,921
Scott: they're still the easiest example, right?

673
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,350
Scott: I need one more group and I win.

674
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:55,335
Scott: Rym is the gnomes.

675
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:58,686
Scott: He is ten dollars short and he will win, right?

676
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:01,476
Scott: I Just say hey Rym.

677
00:44:01,536 --> 00:44:02,540
Scott: I'll give you ten dollars.

678
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,203
Scott: Give me a group.

679
00:44:03,504 --> 00:44:04,187
Scott: Congratulations.

680
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:06,312
Scott: We both win Ta-da.

681
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:07,874
Scott: everyone everyone else loses.

682
00:44:08,134 --> 00:44:14,012
Rym: now Scott and I have actually pulled this off together more often than other people because I Value.

683
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,055
Scott: we go for it.

684
00:44:15,295 --> 00:44:20,390
Scott: I'm more willing to be a lot easier to win in a tie than it is to win alone.

685
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:26,470
Rym: I am more willing to be one of five winners against one loser than I am to be one winner by myself.

686
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:29,718
Scott: As long as you're a winner, what does it matter how many other winners there are see.

687
00:44:29,738 --> 00:44:30,520
Rym: but at the same time?

688
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,800
Rym: Betrayal will often happen because it's like yeah, we'll have soft deals like I'll do this you do this.

689
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:40,738
Scott: Well, that's the thing is even though you agree to go in with someone on a tie, right?

690
00:44:42,281 --> 00:44:55,155
Scott: If the game just as you play the game if you pull way ahead of them and they're sort of useless and they can't really Help you and you can win without them You don't keep going for the tie Just to give them a win when you don't need them to make the wind.

691
00:44:55,255 --> 00:44:56,159
Scott: or the same time.

692
00:44:56,722 --> 00:45:03,900
Rym: I mean, I've seen games where the game gets really into the game theory kind of stuff where you know Scott's being a dick and you know what?

693
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,960
Rym: I'm gonna totally betray him because I can pull it off and win anywhere.

694
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,668
Scott: I realize that the reason to go in on the tie is to make winning easier to sort of guarantee the win But I can get.

695
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:13,820
Scott: you can win on your own.

696
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,704
Scott: You don't need that shit.

697
00:45:14,784 --> 00:45:36,108
Rym: if I can get Scott to keep helping me because he thinks I'm still playing along But I'm setting up the giant betrayal because I know I can pull it off then Well, that's great because the victory as opposed to defeat is great But the sweetest victory in the world is the full-on betrayal victory where you win alone Having betrayed all in your path.

698
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:41,144
Scott: Yeah, it's really even though the game's rules, you know are pretty, you know And you know, it's.

699
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:44,120
Scott: it's the attacking of the groups and the networks of the groups, right?

700
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:54,789
Scott: The the mechanic of everything is money being spent and everyone can spend money on everything Really makes it just like this giant Bargaining sort of disc.

701
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,056
Scott: It's almost like diplomacy.

702
00:45:56,136 --> 00:46:02,560
Scott: in a way It's everyone discussing things everyone arguing and everyone fighting with each other all the time and then eventually someone wins.

703
00:46:04,282 --> 00:46:08,174
Rym: it's It's an absolutely fantastic game because it's really really fun.

704
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:12,955
Rym: It's not the most Heavy on the strategy and tactics game.

705
00:46:12,976 --> 00:46:19,320
Rym: There's a lot more Second-guessing and bluffing and I guess it's not mostly social mechanisms that are being exercised.

706
00:46:19,562 --> 00:46:26,680
Rym: Not a good game to play with strangers I mean, it's a good way to get to know people but to get the full enjoyment kind of like mafia.

707
00:46:27,203 --> 00:46:38,724
Rym: It's a game where you have to play with a bunch of people who you all know Really really well because then all that sort of metagame stuff comes in and it's like oh, I know he's a sap I'll take advantage of him.

708
00:46:38,845 --> 00:46:41,013
Rym: Oh, he's got teamed up in one the last three games.

709
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:42,780
Rym: We know what shit they're trying this time.

710
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:51,199
Rym: Yeah, right Now one thing that I will point out Illuminati is a great game mostly because of the style and the theme and just because it's a good game.

711
00:46:51,239 --> 00:47:02,638
Rym: but Steve Jackson games in general have a history of making good games and they actually made a game that is very similar to Illuminati but is more like I don't know.

712
00:47:03,443 --> 00:47:04,749
Rym: Here's how to take the game.

713
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,940
Rym: That was okay and make it better.

714
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:13,719
Rym: it's basically just a an incremental improvement of Illuminati.

715
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:14,665
Rym: I Forgot what it's called.

716
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:16,474
Rym: I'm trying to find it on the Wikipedia page right now.

717
00:47:16,494 --> 00:47:17,560
Rym: It's like a mafia one.

718
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,627
Rym: Yeah, what's it called called crime Lords?

719
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:21,313
Rym: Yes, Illuminati crime.

720
00:47:21,353 --> 00:47:22,717
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if that's actually.

721
00:47:22,738 --> 00:47:26,540
Scott: I've never played it So I don't know if it's actually better, but basically it's an Illuminati ish game.

722
00:47:26,901 --> 00:47:27,624
Scott: But it's it's.

723
00:47:27,986 --> 00:47:30,275
Scott: it's like there are expansion packs for Illuminati.

724
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:31,884
Scott: We just have more cards I'm all.

725
00:47:31,944 --> 00:47:34,220
Rym: they just make the game better like that 2k pack.

726
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:34,863
Scott: Yeah, they make.

727
00:47:34,923 --> 00:47:38,900
Scott: they make the game better because there's more cards and it's more interesting and more funny and more varied.

728
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:44,518
Scott: But the crime lords game is actually a different game that has slightly different rules.

729
00:47:44,598 --> 00:47:50,145
Scott: as far as I know I've never played it But supposedly it's just a more modern Illuminati with a crime lord theme.

730
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:50,225
Scott: on

731
00:47:50,265 --> 00:48:08,840
Rym: what Steve Jackson said himself when he talked about it at a penguin con a long time ago was that it basically fixes all the things that were obviously wrong with Illuminati and Fiddles with the game mechanics and the balance to just make it a much more solid overall better game But yet keeping all the fun parts of Illuminati.

732
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:12,067
Rym: Hmm someday, I'll just buy it.

733
00:48:12,147 --> 00:48:15,460
Rym: we can play it and find out for sure, but I'd recommend checking it out.

734
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:21,020
Rym: I definitely recommend one person in your group of friends should own Illuminati and with us.

735
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:26,833
Rym: It's kind of the tradition that every year They'll be at the time at which the whole crew gets together and right around.

736
00:48:26,873 --> 00:48:35,123
Rym: that time is usually the time when the chosen ones will sit down and play a full no holds barred game of Illuminati though.

737
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:39,338
Scott: another thing about Illuminati is that when you get the expansion packs more people can play it once.

738
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:41,017
Scott: yes Which makes it even better?

739
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:48,360
