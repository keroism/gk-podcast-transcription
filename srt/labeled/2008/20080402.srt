1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,348
Rym: It's Wednesday April 2nd.

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,232
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:13,739
Scott: I'm Scott yokai.

4
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:26,973
Scott: It's no good Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,746
Rym: I was so wrecked at work today.

6
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,530
Rym: I almost fell asleep like three times.

7
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:41,457
Scott: I was pretty wrecked him and I got into work and I went and I did a bunch of stuff and then I basically played Flash games rest of the day and I died.

8
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:47,059
Rym: Well, actually I came into work and I asked one of the developers like hey Can I turn the log level down on this one thing?

9
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:47,862
Rym: and he was like why?

10
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:52,969
Rym: and I was like because it's generating like four Gigabytes of logs a day and I'm sick of dealing with it.

11
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:56,025
Rym: And they're like, well, is there still a problem with that thing?

12
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:56,750
Rym: And I'm like, yeah kind.

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,819
Rym: He's like, yeah, we should leave it on.

14
00:00:58,424 --> 00:00:59,688
Rym: and then I was like, yeah Well, you know what?

15
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:05,494
Rym: That's probably for the best cuz I'm sure it'll crash soon enough and crash and then I'll be able to Make use of those logs.

16
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,280
Rym: and he was like don't be snarky.

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,390
Rym: and I sit down at my desk and sure enough it was crashed.

18
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:14,869
Rym: Yeah, so I sent him over a cord on fit and some logs.

19
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:21,881
Scott: Cord, I'm fantastic yeah, but There was a little storm here last night, which is fine.

20
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,170
Scott: I like me a storm little thunder lightning action.

21
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,490
Rym: Oh, that was a great storm - it was okay.

22
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:31,530
Scott: The thunder and lightning was not numerous or loud enough But the thing is the rain and the wind are pretty fierce.

23
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:33,659
Rym: The thing is though it was super warm in the morning.

24
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:50,617
Rym: So Emily and I are looking out the window like wow thunderstorm Let's totally run outside and we run outside and it had been 70 degrees when the storm rolled in as It was cold.

25
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:58,205
Scott: as as storms do that makes the power go on and off a little bit, you know Not there's never like gonna be a big blackout, you know, especially at night when everyone's sleeping.

26
00:01:58,225 --> 00:02:03,350
Scott: It doesn't matter so much Unless you have electric heat, but you know, it's just okay, whatever.

27
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:07,090
Scott: But we were pissed off a long time ago because that would turn our computers off.

28
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,670
Rym: Yeah, because our one our house is kind of crappy wiring because we're on the edge of beacon.

29
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:18,450
Rym: So across the street from us a lot of those people start getting their power from other sources Like you can see the different sets of wires.

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:28,090
Scott: Yeah Like when there's a blackout or when a power goes out you can look outside and you can see where there's light and where there's Darkness is different sets of power lines and you can tell where the breakage happened.

31
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:30,921
Rym: But we're kind of on the end of our run.

32
00:02:31,323 --> 00:02:33,070
Rym: So we often have little blips.

33
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:35,930
Rym: Also, our house is not the most well-wired house.

34
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,390
Scott: Yeah, our house the power will be like on off on off and that's not good for computers and other electronic women.

35
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,303
Scott: So we bought the cheapest UPS is imaginable and we brought.

36
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:44,167
Rym: we got several of.

37
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:47,518
Scott: we have four of them I think and the thing is they're fine.

38
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:51,089
Scott: They help out a lot when the power goes blip all the computers are like what?

39
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:51,550
Scott: what happened?

40
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,354
Scott: Nothing, that's right.

41
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:53,098
Scott: Yes.

42
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:54,043
Rym: There's one problem.

43
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:59,261
Rym: However with the cheap UPS So I'm asleep and scouts asleep and the power goes out.

44
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:00,284
Rym: whatever.

45
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:04,501
Rym: now, of course even without this I would have been woken up by the thunderous silence.

46
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,104
Scott: Yeah.

47
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:08,217
Rym: Yeah, but You know when you're this.

48
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:17,690
Rym: I've talked about this before we all you talk about this a lot But if you're tired and an unexpected noise happens your brain Like your body is flailing around trying to deal with it.

49
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:24,963
Rym: But your brain's not awake enough yet to analyze the situation and be like that's not your alarm clock Rym That's your cell phone.

50
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:25,709
Rym: It's ringing.

51
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:34,529
Scott: You can't stop it by turning off the alarm clock no matter how hard you try And now you're gonna go back to sleep and the cell phone stops ringing But you're not gonna wake up in the morning cuz you turned your cell phone off.

52
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,185
Rym: So it's even worse when it's a really unexpected sound.

53
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:50,350
Scott: so we're asleep and suddenly All the UPS's had run out of battery because they're cheap shit UPS's and they make loud noises.

54
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,202
Rym: Well, they make noises saying hey the power's out.

55
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:55,923
Rym: Just so you know, hey the power's out Just so you know.

56
00:03:56,451 --> 00:04:00,886
Rym: so and they actually last quite a while because we have one computer plugged into each and then the out.

57
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:10,518
Scott: the last ones just like the night like crawl out of bed and stumble around turning off all these stupid UPS's and plugging things in and switching to my Cellphone alarm and all this bullshit.

58
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:11,482
Rym: I was laying in bed.

59
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:12,104
Rym: I'm like Emily.

60
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:13,530
Rym: your cell phone's going off.

61
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:15,958
Rym: Emily your cell phone's got.

62
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:16,721
Rym: oh god.

63
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:17,283
Rym: Damn it.

64
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:19,329
Rym: No, I know what's going on.

65
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,870
Rym: It's pretty bad, I really like crawl under my desk.

66
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,930
Rym: I'm like trying to log into my computer to turn it off, but the monitor wasn't on but I was too tired to realize that.

67
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:33,610
Rym: Yeah, so in the end I just fucking turned off the UPS unplugged everything and then went back to sleep.

68
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,230
Scott: Yeah, I did similar things in my room But then I lay back in bed.

69
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,344
Scott: I'm like it's not cuz I looked at the clock before I turned it off.

70
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:45,127
Scott: cuz you know as the clock is running on the Battery power and it's at 1158 and I'd gone to bed at like 10 something.

71
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:45,790
Scott: It was like fuck.

72
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:50,110
Scott: I felt like I was asleep for hours, but really I was not asleep very long at all.

73
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:53,221
Rym: The worst thing is I get back in bed and then I hear faintly.

74
00:04:53,242 --> 00:05:06,481
Scott: Oh Yeah UPS on the networking equipment Yeah, and then when I woke up this morning gonna turn that back on because I couldn't get on the Internet's Yeah, well the thing is it whenever that UPS is going off.

75
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:09,288
Rym: It's pretty much equidistant from me and Scott.

76
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:14,250
Rym: So Well, I'll kind of lay in bed and thinking I hope Scott deals with it and he'll lay in a bed thing.

77
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,450
Rym: I hope Rym deals with it and then eventually one of us will stagger out there and like kick it to death.

78
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:20,556
Scott: It did generally sucked.

79
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,564
Scott: Hey, I use my cell phone alarm to wake up.

80
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:26,760
Rym: Yeah, my cell phone Strangely enough is having some problems.

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,182
Rym: Suddenly.

82
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:36,770
Rym: I think I'm gonna buy a new one already The the backlight just didn't turn off today really and it's still on and try messing with the power savings.

83
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:47,163
Rym: I think The little thing that tells when you close the lid Is broken or something and it just it's.

84
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,407
Rym: I think I gotta get a new cell phone.

85
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:52,202
Rym: Just take it to the place Yeah, and they're gonna tell me get a new cell phone.

86
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:52,584
Rym: Yeah.

87
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:56,966
Scott: All right, whatever Alright, so ready for news isn't what nuts?

88
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:57,268
Rym: I think.

89
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:01,102
Scott: so You can do you want to go first and I'll go first cuz I got news.

90
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:02,970
Rym: I'm like some other lazy people.

91
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,895
Scott: Hey, I'm not lazy.

92
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:07,397
Scott: I'm Proactive.

93
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:08,470
Scott: try to help the listeners.

94
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:16,429
Rym: Yeah, you know The only time I ever use the word Proactive is like it might work and there's something that needs to be done and there's something fun to do.

95
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:22,009
Rym: Usually fun to do is like set up something new and awesome and not fun to do is like do the work.

96
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:27,365
Rym: So it's like why aren't you working on the thing you're supposed to be working on?

97
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:32,509
Rym: I'm being proactive Mmm, anyway, so there's a lot of Otakon news.

98
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:34,920
Rym: I think the most important one.

99
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,035
Rym: if you didn't realize it yet The artists alley is done.

100
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:38,658
Rym: It's sold out.

101
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:38,979
Rym: You're.

102
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,544
Rym: if you don't if you didn't know you're screwed.

103
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:45,196
Rym: Not necessarily, but Otakon historically has a problem.

104
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:52,350
Rym: where the artist alley is so popular despite being so gigantic It's that artist alley is bigger than most anime cons.

105
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:57,854
Scott: It's bad that pretty much the amount of room that the artists alley and the art show take up That room.

106
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:01,750
Scott: you could have an entire comic convention in that room room to spare.

107
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:04,464
Rym: Not only that it's more fun than a lot of anime cons.

108
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:10,704
Rym: Yeah, I would go to Otakon I think just for the artist alley but yet it's just one room of Otakon Otakon.

109
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:21,148
Rym: but Historically when they announced the artist alley, it'll pretty much effectively be sold out within I don't know four seconds Maybe six seconds if you're lucky.

110
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:24,147
Rym: But this year they did something a little different.

111
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:55,730
Rym: now We got kind of a head start on this because our obsessive-compulsive friends Discovered the ASP that handles registration before it was announced and basically sat there all day hitting f5 until it worked and then told all of us some of them might have been pressing ctrl R. they might have been but Artist alley is open and this year It doesn't look like they're handling it the way they usually do because they didn't say Oh, it's already sold out and they haven't made any announcements to that effect.

112
00:07:56,071 --> 00:08:02,843
Rym: But the form just works and you fill it out all the artist alley stuff and then You get an email back saying we got your request.

113
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:04,610
Rym: You will get some information soon.

114
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,144
Rym: Now, I don't know how they're gonna handle it this year.

115
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:16,970
Rym: I have no idea I have absolutely no insight into this and furthermore No one on the Otakon staff has given me any secret details about this in particular.

116
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:22,518
Rym: So what you're about to hear is entirely speculation speculation.

117
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:22,578
Scott: if

118
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:53,957
Rym: I Were running the artist alley at Otakon and I would still say, you know, yeah, it's first come first serve Let it be however But secretly I would have in the previous Otakon gone around the artist alley or sent my lackeys around the artist alley Figured out who was good and made a list of like the people who are awesome and I also would have made a separate list of the people who were wasting their tables or In my opinion or in the opinion of say some sort of group of staffers working together What was not worth being there?

119
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:56,105
Scott: because yeah, we weren't worth being there though.

120
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,209
Rym: No, we totally weren't.

121
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:01,156
Rym: Well this year will be worth being there But last year not so much.

122
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:04,529
Rym: but part of that was that we didn't know we had a table until right before the con.

123
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:15,530
Rym: but what I would do is I would kind of handpick who gets to be in because a Lot of people want to be in the artist alley at Otakon and Otakon has the best artist alley of any con.

124
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:24,349
Rym: But three or four times the number of people who can fit in that artist alley Want to be in that artist alley every year and there's almost no fair way to do it.

125
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:33,540
Rym: And when there's no fair way to do it You at least could do a way that I don't know makes the alley as good as possible for the people in it and for The people wanting to peruse it.

126
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:35,730
Rym: So I think I would have done something like that.

127
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:43,151
Rym: I don't know what Otakon is doing, but it was the smoothest registration they've ever had so kudos to them All right.

128
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:45,495
Rym: Yeah, nothing to say is that I got no god.

129
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:54,080
Rym: No, so beyond that you got more than that Otakon as there there have been a lot of hints that this is gonna be the biggest and baddest Otakon ever.

130
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:56,710
Rym: I mean, it's their 10th year at the BCC.

131
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,468
Rym: It's also the 15th Otakon and There were a lot of rumors going around about.

132
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:03,457
Rym: you know, they're gonna get some crazy musical act.

133
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:06,626
Rym: Oh my god They're gonna get some crazy musical act some up.

134
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:15,760
Rym: some staffers might have been banning these flames by periodically emailing us saying hey Something cool is gonna be at Otakon, but I can't tell you what.

135
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:27,479
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah not fooling anybody but it's finally been announced or at least part of it Otakon is going to have as their musical act one of their at least one of their musical act.

136
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,007
Scott: now I don't know if there are any more musical acts I would suggest that there might be.

137
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:33,271
Scott: there probably will be.

138
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,800
Rym: I would be fine if this was the only musical act.

139
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:38,543
Rym: They have announced that they have got jam Project.

140
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:43,200
Rym: jam project is responsible for a lot of the music from anime that you know and love.

141
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:51,940
Rym: I'm not gonna do a whole show or a whole thing here about jam project But check out the Otakon press release and you'll see the names of a lot of things you might recognize.

142
00:10:52,161 --> 00:11:04,790
Scott: I think jam project was a great choice because you know in the past they've had like, you know huge You know much more much more popular bands at least, you know, it's sort of like hit, you know pop You know rock j-rock music like what

143
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,819
Rym: they got laraku which was like amazing.

144
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:17,122
Scott: Yeah But Basically, those are bands that were just musical acts that happen to have one of their songs be used as an opener closer to an Anime or something.

145
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:19,950
Rym: Well, and they also happen to be really popular in Japan.

146
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:28,380
Scott: Yeah, but this case it's actually people who specifically make Anime music very specifically and like all their music is anime music.

147
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:34,180
Scott: So it definitely has the wide appeal to both the music fans and the anime fans both.

148
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:42,060
Scott: So you're not gonna get those people complaining like Those j-rockers come to my anime convention and right at those people can shove it.

149
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,780
Scott: They those people can indeed shove it, but I think this is a much better choice overall.

150
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:50,069
Rym: See, I don't know necessary.

151
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,540
Rym: I think it's a good choice.

152
00:11:51,741 --> 00:12:04,866
Rym: I wouldn't necessarily say better but one thing that this group has over other possible musical acts is that everyone in the audience is gonna recognize a lot of the things they play and You know how anime cons.

153
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:11,738
Rym: all you have to do if you're on stage is pretty much say something like hey guys Pikachu and the crowd just loses their shit.

154
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:18,222
Rym: Well, if it's if it's these people playing songs that people recognize the crowd is gonna go crazy Like.

155
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:20,230
Rym: I can't even imagine what the crowd is gonna be like.

156
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,893
Scott: there will be.

157
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:26,929
Rym: all shit will be lost is basically Now, I mean some of the people involved in this.

158
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,300
Rym: the name that you'll probably know more than any is Masami okui.

159
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:34,881
Rym: Look up what Masami okui has been responsible for Mm-hmm.

160
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:38,012
Rym: Now that is not all of the awesome news for Otakon.

161
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:40,440
Scott: for how much awesome Otakon news do you have?

162
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,167
Scott: I'm sure you're not until August.

163
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:44,860
Scott: Can't you save some of this news for when you don't have news next week?

164
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,120
Rym: I think there's going to be a steady stream of Otakon news right up until Otakon.

165
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,586
Rym: Oh good god, because I too

166
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:53,611
Scott: many people we got like four

167
00:12:53,712 --> 00:13:05,618
Rym: months too many people on the inside have been hinting that Yeah, this is gonna be like the baddest Otakon ever and I Kind of expected alright, they're gonna get a crazy musical act or two and then they announce that it's like.

168
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,486
Rym: alright They've got a crazy musical act.

169
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:11,000
Rym: Okay, but I did not expect that Madhouse.

170
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:20,536
Rym: Madhouse Studios, you know Madhouse It's going one of the best animation studios in the planet is going to be animating the opener as in like.

171
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:23,858
Rym: if Otakon were an anime They're animating the opener to Otakon.

172
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:34,028
Scott: Yeah, yeah see that's a genius idea because any anime convention even super big ones like Otakon not enough people go to opening ceremonies.

173
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:40,557
Scott: most of the people who go are like nubs or People who really have a thing for opening ceremonies or such.

174
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,031
Scott: Yeah I mean even we don't go to opening ceremonies.

175
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:46,742
Rym: really the only kind I ever went to opening ceremonies That was.

176
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:56,120
Rym: I went to anime central's twice, but that was because back then I went to opening ceremonies at penguin Otakon once and we tried to get the crowd to yell something and it failed.

177
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,279
Scott: We tried to start a big chant and it didn't work because people weren't into it.

178
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,220
Scott: now I was like, what's the point of coming opening ceremonies if everyone isn't gonna get all excited and rowdy?

179
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:06,820
Rym: I think Otakon's opening ceremonies are gonna be all exciting and rowdy.

180
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:10,893
Scott: This is the most genius idea ever to get people to come to opening ceremonies.

181
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:13,180
Scott: show them an animation that can't be seen anywhere else.

182
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,000
Scott: That was especially made just for those opening ceremonies.

183
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:17,204
Rym: Yep, now they might.

184
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:27,820
Scott: that's like if you had a video game convention and you made a video game that would only be played at Your convention made like by Square Enix to only be played at your convention at one event.

185
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:30,737
Scott: He would be lined up around the doors.

186
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:38,998
Scott: now I think that what says the most as in they'd be standing outside the door of their homes and the line to the convention would be forming for the.

187
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,600
Rym: Here's a quote from the thing on anime news network because this is this is Otakon's Jim Vowels.

188
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:54,399
Rym: You might remember Jim Vowels from such things as being at every Otakon ever and being awesome and liking Doctor Who More than any man should or than any man could know.

189
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:58,718
Rym: No, but he's one of those like we talked about in the forum the.

190
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:02,412
Rym: you know There's staffers at cons and then there's super staffers.

191
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:08,840
Rym: He's one of those super staffers, but Quotes this was the most fun I've ever had.

192
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:16,592
Rym: Now that quote is in reference to the meeting where they talked about what was gonna be in this opener And how it was gonna be put together.

193
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:20,247
Rym: Oh good guy That was somewhat a selective quote.

194
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,231
Rym: It's actually the most fun.

195
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:25,690
Rym: I've ever had at an Otakon meeting No, all right, but I don't know the most fun.

196
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,332
Rym: I've ever had.

197
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:28,140
Rym: seems like a more news bite worthy.

198
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:32,249
Rym: Yeah, I can imagine to be quite fun But yeah Otakon this year is gonna be.

199
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:35,320
Rym: I can't even begin to think about awesome Otakon's watch.

200
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,820
Scott: It's gonna be epic fail like anime Boston.

201
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:38,886
Scott: It could happen.

202
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,536
Scott: actually it could happen not likely but it could happen.

203
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:45,732
Rym: speaking of that I want to touch on this very very briefly before Scott gets in.

204
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:49,237
Rym: after we talked about the news anime Boston We got a few emails.

205
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:51,717
Rym: What two of them were from?

206
00:15:52,260 --> 00:16:04,922
Rym: Otak anime Boston staffers who wish not to be named and we also got a lot of feedback from people are at the con and Like we kind of guessed it people said that other than registration the rest of anime Boston was in fact awesome As I

207
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:06,813
Scott: as I suggested

208
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:18,929
Rym: and furthermore it seems like they are fully aware internally as to exactly what the problem was and It'll be fixed next year or more bad things will happen.

209
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,880
Scott: I am sure that an appropriate number of heads are rolling now.

210
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,819
Rym: I can't really say more yet because it's way too soon, but there's too soon too soon.

211
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:31,980
Rym: There's a good chance that we are going to be attending anime boss.

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,069
Scott: Well a better chance than ever before.

213
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:35,073
Scott: I wouldn't say good shit,

214
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:36,679
Rym: I've already tentatively agreed

215
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:46,495
Scott: All right, so I couldn't find a worthwhile news and I'm tired of anime news network and whatnot, right So I'm not doing a news but anime

216
00:16:46,515 --> 00:16:47,080
Rym: news Nina

217
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:54,786
Scott: Yeah, whatever and I've been doing a lot of geek bites on Wednesdays of you know, like comics I've read or whatnot.

218
00:16:54,806 --> 00:17:00,400
Scott: All right, but I actually am reading novel right now So I can't be reading any comics to do a geek bite of.

219
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:08,275
Scott: So I try to think of something to fill this space with and I got an idea For a bit and I want to see if anyone out likes this bit.

220
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:15,020
Scott: and if you like this bit I can make it a monthly bit and so it's sort of impossible for me to make this bit more or less than monthly.

221
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:17,029
Rym: So what are you gonna call this bit?

222
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,359
Rym: I mean, I have no idea that trouble naming bits.

223
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,160
Rym: So we started out where like we called everything a geek.

224
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,931
Scott: So why don't we tell what the bit is before we think?

225
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:24,573
Scott: think of the name?

226
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:31,840
Rym: Well first, you know our kind of Ad-hoc naming philosophy was that we kind of everything is geek something in camel case.

227
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:35,555
Rym: But then we started falling away from that because nine times out of ten.

228
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:36,760
Rym: That sounds really dumb.

229
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,827
Rym: Yeah, but all right what you bit?

230
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:44,084
Scott: All right, so you know, you listeners might know that I do not.

231
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:56,096
Scott: I purchase comic books monthly mostly not actual comp books But you know big trade paperbacks and whatnot from a website or a service known as DCB service.com discount comic book service.

232
00:17:56,136 --> 00:18:11,420
Scott: calm and Basically what they allow me to do is I can order pretty much anything that diamond the evil comic distributors Of the direct market distribute two months in advance and then I get a tremendous discount.

233
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,829
Scott: We're talking like 40% off.

234
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:16,118
Scott: We're talking like four dollar comic books for 75 cents.

235
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,467
Scott: It's way cheap, but I have to.

236
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:21,940
Scott: the only disadvantage is that to buy things sight unseen?

237
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:23,786
Rym: There's there's another disadvantage.

238
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,880
Rym: I buy things through Scott because he'll say hey, do you want this?

239
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,084
Rym: Hey, do you want this?

240
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:32,160
Rym: and a lot of times I'll say yes without listening because it's so cheap.

241
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,742
Rym: I don't care.

242
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:36,233
Rym: and then Scott gives me a pile of comic books that I remember.

243
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:38,219
Rym: Oh, wait, I don't want this damn it.

244
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,328
Rym: Yeah, what am I gonna do with a serenity comic?

245
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:40,990
Rym: It's awful.

246
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,396
Scott: Yeah, was it awful.

247
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:42,858
Scott: Did you read it?

248
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,446
Rym: It was Expectedly bad.

249
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,119
Rym: It wasn't awful, but it wasn't good.

250
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:48,964
Scott: So there are.

251
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,554
Scott: there are other websites that provide a similar service.

252
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:52,980
Scott: heroes corner is one of them.

253
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,753
Scott: I don't you know, I don't advocate any particular one.

254
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:56,878
Scott: I just happen to use this one.

255
00:18:56,898 --> 00:19:11,180
Scott: and so basically what happens here is I get every month in the mail a giant box of comic books and I recommend Using a service like this to anyone who buys a significant amount of comics on a monthly basis.

256
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,493
Scott: Who doesn't have a lot of money to spend and really really need that big discount?

257
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:27,758
Scott: or if you don't live anywhere near a Comic book store conveniently, you know because then this way you don't it just shows up at your house You don't have to go driving to some comic book store an hour away or any bullshit like that, right?

258
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,400
Scott: But I get this box of comics every month like at the beginning of the month.

259
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,793
Scott: It's like clockwork and sometimes the little box sometimes a big box, you know, who knows.

260
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:47,080
Scott: but I thought it might be an interesting bit To just sort of briefly go over Everything I got in the box this month and maybe you would call the bit like Scott's box.

261
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:47,666
Scott: I don't know.

262
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:51,942
Scott: That's not the best name I think.

263
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:53,286
Rym: I think you've named it.

264
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,790
Rym: There's no going back from that.

265
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,773
Scott: Oh this going back.

266
00:19:55,914 --> 00:19:57,940
Rym: There's there is no turning back.

267
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,123
Scott: Yeah, there's that.

268
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:00,728
Rym: you've already opened the coffin.

269
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:02,674
Rym: It's open the vampires out.

270
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:04,740
Rym: You can't put him back in the other coffin as a mummy.

271
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,595
Scott: I'll just open that and they'll fight and then I can go back to choosing.

272
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:08,500
Scott: maybe a slime will come.

273
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:11,972
Rym: Everyone knows that vampires and mummies are natural allies.

274
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:13,657
Rym: You need a werewolf to fight them.

275
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:16,579
Rym: or good That's or a van peel.

276
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:26,182
Scott: So I'm just gonna briefly go over every comic or you know book that was in the box this month and you know If this.

277
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:34,271
Scott: I think this will help people sort of get an idea about what kind of comics I'm buying What sort of comics they might be interested in buying?

278
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:34,653
Scott: I don't know.

279
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:35,656
Rym: Tell me how.

280
00:20:35,696 --> 00:20:36,760
Rym: that totally reminds me.

281
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,029
Rym: Yeah, I got a geek buy real quick.

282
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,817
Rym: I read that Green Lantern Scott talked about last.

283
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:41,420
Scott: I was terrible.

284
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,383
Rym: What the fuck was that?

285
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,326
Rym: That was awful.

286
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:44,891
Rym: Why was Aquaman even there?

287
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,235
Rym: He didn't even do anything.

288
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,960
Rym: Neither did the flash seriously.

289
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:49,014
Rym: Wow, okay, I'm done.

290
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:54,342
Scott: All right Okay, so I'm gonna do this and then you're gonna go in the form and tell me if you think you want me to do This again.

291
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:55,389
Scott: All right.

292
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,240
Scott: So the first thing I'm just doing this in the order.

293
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,616
Scott: It's listed on the website because on the website you can see what showed up in the box.

294
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:01,198
Scott: It's pretty useful.

295
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:07,400
Rym: Yes, yes in case you don't want to actually look in the box you can go.

296
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,480
Scott: Well, it's easier for me to look at this webpage than to have a pile of comics in your room on the floor.

297
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,242
Rym: That's true.

298
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:12,563
Rym: Okay.

299
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:18,001
Scott: So the first thing that was in the box back Mongolian chop squad manga volume 11.

300
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,626
Scott: There are 19 volumes in total.

301
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:21,152
Scott: This is you know back.

302
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:23,280
Scott: It's the rock and roll kind of manga.

303
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:26,758
Rym: I gotta actually watch that anime so we can talk about the anime I liked a lot.

304
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:29,594
Scott: But the thing is with the anime is at the end of the anime.

305
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:37,860
Scott: the anime sort of ends Not at the climax of the story and then they sort of tell the rest of the story During the closing credits of the last episode.

306
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,140
Scott: So I wanted to get the manga to see first of all if there was any difference between that and the tv show.

307
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:52,740
Scott: And also it is, you know sort of get the full fleshed out story that was in that epilogue and right now around volume 11 It's reaching the point where that of that climax.

308
00:21:53,222 --> 00:22:01,980
Scott: So now I think i'm gonna i'm finally gonna get to read new stuff as opposed to just sort of reading a Manga retelling of the anime even though the anime was retelling of the manga.

309
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:08,845
Scott: next Uh andromeda stories volume three, I think this I think this is the last volume.

312
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:21,060
Scott: I can't guarantee you'll like andromeda stories.

313

Rym: Are you gonna keep reading it till the end?

419
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:22,607
Rym: I don't think it's gonna end because I kind of lost interest already.

420
00:28:22,627 --> 00:28:32,051
Rym: Yeah Might be about the by two my second two favorite characters.

421
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:34,820
Scott: I think it's about the story of him getting the eyeball.

422
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:35,683
Scott: That's what I think.

423
00:28:35,723 --> 00:28:38,093
Rym: It's about but it's so easy to get those eyeballs.

424
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:38,836
Rym: Just go buy them.

425
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:39,538
Scott: I know right.

426
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:42,549
Scott: Uh goon saga manga volume three.

427
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:45,540
Scott: Remember that contest we're having where vertical sent us the three volumes.

428
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,687
Scott: I've talked about this before.

429
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:49,040
Scott: well, you know, they gave us the three volumes.

430
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:56,260
Scott: But now the third volume that I paid for showed up Full metal alchemist manga volume 16, you know the full metal alchemist manga.

431
00:28:56,562 --> 00:29:00,020
Scott: I got it at the beginning because it was the full metal alchemist manga and that was so long ago.

432
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:04,683
Scott: Right, like if the full metal alchemist manga volume one came out now I probably wouldn't buy it.

433
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:09,160
Scott: and I started reading it and it was good and it diverged wildly from the show.

434
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:10,914
Scott: But it wasn't bad.

435
00:29:10,954 --> 00:29:12,142
Scott: It wasn't great But it was.

436
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:15,599
Scott: it was just kind of normal and at times I thought about stopping buying it.

437
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:24,355
Scott: But the last volume that I read I think volume 15 Like came on full force and totally reminded me why i'm buying this.

438
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,138
Scott: so volume 16.

439
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,640
Scott: Here we go Phoenix volume 12.

440
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,473
Scott: There are only 11 volumes of osama tezuka's phoenix.

441
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:33,281
Scott: this volume 12.

442
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:41,650
Scott: What viz has done is they have taken some earlier works of tezuka and some other things and sort of created a 12th volume of phoenix.

443
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:46,960
Scott: Uh to sort of you know round out their publication, you know their series.

444
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,473
Scott: So if you if you're buying the other 11 phoenixes, you gotta buy the 12th phoenix.

445
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:57,860
Scott: and the last thing I bought was Transhuman number one, which is the guy who does nightly news brian hickman.

446
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:05,126
Scott: Basically, if you haven't done any redney brian hickman's stuff, I think it's hey brian hickman It might be someone else hickman.

447
00:30:05,146 --> 00:30:05,789
Scott: I thought great.

448
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,352
Scott: I forget.

449
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:09,827
Scott: Sorry, but he's basically His comics.

450
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:21,671
Scott: Yeah, his comics are amazing because they're basically like graphic storytelling via graphic design and they'll just blow you away if you Everyone should go buy nightly news.

451
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:23,580
Scott: There's a trade paperback of nightly news.

452
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:29,379
Scott: This is just the first issue of transhuman so I can sort of test it out to see if I want to buy the trade When it eventually comes out.

453
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:31,899
Scott: And that's what I got in scott's box.

454
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,974
Rym: Things of the day.

455
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:44,067
Rym: so utenna is like one of the greatest anime ever made.

456
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:45,190
Rym: we reviewed pretty great.

457
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:47,547
Rym: We reviewed it before pretty terrific.

458
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:54,850
Rym: someday We'll do some final thoughts bits, but that's complicated because utenna is one of the more complicated and literate shows out there.

459
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:04,737
Rym: but uh if you need any more glowing recommendation as gomi dog in the forums because she finally saw the whole show and She will tell you Objectively how good it is.

460
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:06,042
Rym: I might be a little biased.

461
00:31:06,424 --> 00:31:15,606
Rym: I'm kind of an utenna fanboy but uh kind of It's like the best show ever made with the exception of irresponsible captain tyler both of which made me cry.

462
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:22,369
Rym: Anyway, so teen girl squad plus utenna equals uh Hilarity.

463
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:24,229
Rym: I'm gonna leave it at that.

464
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:32,249
Rym: The only other thing i'll say is that if you have not seen all of utana or at least if you've not seen any of utana This is still kind of funny.

465
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:36,950
Rym: The more utana you've seen the funnier this is and the less spoilerific.

466
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:38,570
Rym: It's not spoilerific.

467
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:47,802
Rym: it's one of those like ava where like you see things in the opener or you see things and They might be a spoiler, but you have no context.

468
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,006
Rym: So they're not a spoiler.

469
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:54,881
Rym: That's sort of true Like if you see A scene of a giant white ray making people turn to goop.

470
00:31:55,322 --> 00:31:59,076
Rym: that doesn't really spoil ava because you have no idea What the hell that's all about.

471
00:31:59,137 --> 00:31:59,740
Scott: That's true.

472
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,182
Scott: It's true.

473
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:13,817
Scott: But yeah, uh If you are crazy with the spoilers you do want to avoid it though Yes and also if you really need to understand both teen girl squad and utenna to really Get the fullness of this mashup.

474
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:17,468
Scott: Otherwise, you're not getting really out of it what you could get out of it.

475
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:19,479
Rym: I think there are Three possible.

476
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:27,710
Rym: I think there are three levels of Having seen utana in terms of getting all the jokes here And if you hit the third level you pretty much saw the rest of the show.

477
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,328
Scott: It's a very deep uh mashup and that's why it's high quality and thing of the day.

478
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:32,613
Scott: Yeah All right.

479
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:33,096
Scott: Check this out.

480
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,109
Scott: There's a guy named evan shaner.

00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:39,166
Scott: He's got a you know, he's an artist dude makes comics and things.

00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:40,190
Scott: he's pretty good with the arts.

00:32:40,531 --> 00:32:45,130
Scott: He's got a website and a you know deviantart and all that stuff just like all the other arts peoples.

484
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:51,610
Scott: And in his little blog here he made a little post on st Patrick's day that I didn't discover until recently.

485
00:32:52,351 --> 00:32:56,949
Scott: And in it, he has a little comic with him and his friends on st Patrick's day a little one panel comic kind of funny.

486
00:32:57,673 --> 00:32:58,817
Scott: And he also has a mashup.

00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:05,970
Scott: He did a little mashup with the watchman Little little mashup between the watchman and uh and peanuts.

488
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,756
Rym: That is some hardcore action.

489
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:11,062
Scott: It is a hardcore high quality mashup.

490
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:17,530
Scott: You got you got your linus comedian your doc manhattan brown your uh.

Scott: pig pen pig pen alley guy.

495
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:35,862
Rym: He's not so much dirty as just frumpy and middle-aged.

496
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:37,930
Scott: I know but he's big ben for the alley guy.

497
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:39,138
Scott: I forget the alley guy's name.

498
00:33:39,421 --> 00:33:40,629
Scott: Ah, and what's the girl's name?

499
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:42,836
Rym: I don't even remember which girl.

500
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,949
Rym: there's more girls and peanuts than one the one who's going with.

501
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:48,176
Rym: Dr Manhattan because there's peppermint patty.

502
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:48,638
Rym: No.

503
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:49,581
Scott: No, I know it's lucy.

504
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:49,962
Scott: But who?

505
00:33:50,203 --> 00:33:52,350
Rym: the watchman name, you know, I already forgot her name.

506
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:54,666
Scott: Yeah, yeah her lucy's the girl.

507
00:33:54,948 --> 00:34:05,206
Rym: Sorry Anyway, we're gonna talk about the show look at it tonight that we haven't seen in a long time but that's fine because In all and in fact, I actually only saw like the first seven episodes.

508
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:06,150
Rym: I never watched the rest.

509
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:12,949
Scott: That's fine because the show is really shallow and you don't need to really watch it recently to have a bunch to say about it.

510
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,690
Scott: Plus a lot of the things you have to say about the show are meta.

511
00:34:16,032 --> 00:34:28,790
Rym: we're gonna talk a lot about the history of anime fandom in the us because gatekeepers was a forgettable Mediocre like, you know highly well produced but just other otherwise forgettable show.

512
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:34,310
Scott: Gatekeepers was a show that was on tv when japanese school kids got home from school.

513
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:45,380
Scott: you know is that kind of show like, you know, come home from school and Watch high school kids fight big alien robots pow Zap that that sort of show.

514
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:51,040
Scott: and you know, we we watched it At the rit anime club in our freshman year.

515
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:56,601
Scott: So in the year 2000 when it came out And you know, it was it was very shallow.

516
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:57,885
Scott: It wasn't a deep show.

517
00:34:57,905 --> 00:35:02,953
Scott: It wasn't a high quality show but At the time You know gonzo It was.

518
00:35:03,073 --> 00:35:25,549
Scott: it was better animation than being seen in many other things at least in terms of the digital Technologies used by gonzo who had you know been making like video game, uh, you know cut scenes until then and It was one of the first digital fan subs and it was also a show that just the way it's structured If you have a room full of excited anime fans, they can yell and cheer and go.

519
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:31,068
Rym: It's one of those shows that sets you up with things that are designed to make someone yell, yep

520
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:42,262
Scott: Basically, here's how the show goes right high school kids Alien invaders the alien invaders are all cool and stylish like they all have black hats But one of them always has a red hat and he's the weak point.

521
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:47,510
Scott: then they all form together Right into like a giant blob or something, right?

522
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,527
Scott: And the cool part of each episode is seeing what the bad guys form into like in one.

523
00:35:52,668 --> 00:36:00,770
Scott: in one episode They form into like a piece of a super highway so it's like these two pieces of street are stomping around the town.

524
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:05,130
Scott: Uh in another and I think the first episode they're just like a giant black ball.

525
00:36:05,712 --> 00:36:12,269
Scott: You know, they have all these different, you know formations and it's it's always sort of funny to see How the bad guys decide to attack this time.

526
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:16,467
Scott: uh And the rest of it is just these high school kids.

527
00:36:16,487 --> 00:36:23,976
Scott: or you know They join or forced to join the secret organization aegis And jokai and jesu.

528
00:36:24,357 --> 00:36:33,710
Scott: and then there's these really cool kind of stylish scenes where they're like sent out into action and it sort of got like a Like a bit of a 50s styling to like drive an old motorcycle to the scene.

529
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:38,830
Rym: The show was fly a retro rocket to the scene in like the late 60s in japan.

530
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:41,889
Scott: Yeah, that's that's one thing you might not realize watching the show.

531
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:44,039
Scott: I mean you have to kind of pay attention to that.

532
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:46,510
Scott: it's set in an older time period.

533
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:48,759
Rym: Not but it is the deal.

534
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:55,765
Rym: we'll talk about gatekeepers itself first because I would have had a lot more to say about this show if we were doing GeekNights.

535
00:36:56,127 --> 00:37:09,830
Rym: I don't know like April something in the year 2000 when I saw it because the show was Really crazily popular in america and it was like a big deal and everyone watched it Everyone knew about it and it was oh my god.

536
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:14,546
Rym: If the same show or a similar show would come out today, it would have been completely ignored.

537
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:17,074
Rym: Yep, and There's there's.

538
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,040
Rym: the show is not deep at all.

539
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:24,940
Scott: It is pretty much just fight the bad guys An incredibly shallow high school character development.

540
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,602
Rym: I mean it there's.

541
00:37:25,683 --> 00:37:27,369
Rym: it follows shun the main character.

542
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:27,489
Rym: who?

543
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:32,510
Rym: Happens to have the most badass gate in the world gate by the way is just the powers they have.

544
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:41,478
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know one girl is like gate open and she shoots an arrow with a magic gate and another girl like goes gate open and she Plays the piano and it makes things happen.

545
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:48,447
Scott: I think her superpower was that she was incredibly stupid Yep, and the main guy of course goes gates open and he has a sword.

546
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,172
Scott: Duh Sword.

547
00:37:50,714 --> 00:37:55,690
Rym: i'm not even gonna bother talking about the plot really because it's the show was just eye candy.

548
00:37:56,113 --> 00:38:04,370
Rym: And the things to remember about the show are one The way gatekeepers and like military people within this organization saluted each other.

549
00:38:05,113 --> 00:38:11,477
Rym: You could not walk around rit without someone doing that to you Every day for like a month after.

550
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:17,158
Scott: it wasn't that bad but at anime club people would be going like I go ages All the time.

551
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,310
Rym: it was and they make.

552
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:23,765
Scott: I had a gatekeepers, uh, uh id card in my wallet that we got for free.

553
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:25,550
Rym: somehow a lot of us had them.

554
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:26,349
Scott: Yeah, we did.

555
00:38:26,663 --> 00:38:34,373
Rym: Yeah this show was really popular at rit and the showing of it in the anime club was crazy yelling and screaming because What's his name?

556
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:37,925
Rym: the guy who's like the head officer of the commander of aegis.

557
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:46,100
Scott: every time he would send him out on mission He would do this phoenix right style pointing kind of thing like go You know what like aegis attack or something.

558
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,910
Scott: I forget exactly what he said to call it phoenix right style.

559
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:52,889
Rym: Does it a disservice if you think phoenix right has a powerful point?

560
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,676
Rym: Phoenix right has got nothing.

561
00:38:55,836 --> 00:39:09,909
Rym: phoenix right is like a beginning pupil of the gatekeepers commander Like whenever he was about to do it you could tell that like the people animating it and everything were excited Because it would like zoom in and his hand would come up his whole body would rotate.

562
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,640
Scott: His hand would like come out from behind his head.

563
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,410
Rym: It would fly around in a circle with motion blur.

564
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:18,724
Rym: It would come forward with action lines so hard.

565
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,970
Rym: The screen would shake.

566
00:39:20,431 --> 00:39:28,470
Scott: Yeah, it was that alone made the show worth watching pretty much and also like, you know The bus that turns into like a heavily armored vehicle.

567
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:35,315
Rym: I think the best thing was that the secret base of aegis was just in the high school and It was secret.

568
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:37,942
Rym: I don't think you can see me making quotation marks.

569
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,947
Scott: It was a clark kent kind of secret.

570
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:48,750
Rym: Not even that Everyone and I mean pretty much everyone on the planet except the bad guys knew that that was the aegis headquarters.

571
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:53,718
Rym: They'd be like, oh the high school Yeah, you'd be sitting in high school in class.

572
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,468
Scott: suddenly one year's one kid that always leaves.

573
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:57,010
Scott: all the time.

574
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:07,273
Rym: Lee walks out of the room like the fire alarm goes off and then and then a rocket flies out of the roof like basically like a smoke would appear if we're like, oh there's a Fire.

575
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:12,150
Rym: and then like the bus full of guns flow not guns, but gatekeeper craft flies away.

576
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:17,822
Scott: Basically, it's just a silly after school show with animation.

577
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:19,747
Scott: That was impressive digital animation.

578
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:20,990
Scott: That was impressive at the time.

579
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:22,595
Scott: It's really shallow.

580
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:23,518
Scott: It's good.

581
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:28,774
Scott: If you want to have a fun time with a bunch of you know, anime club type people But it's really.

582
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:33,768
Scott: it's not worth watching all the episodes unless you really don't have a lot better to do.

583
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:36,315
Scott: I mean, it's okay But it's not great or anything.

584
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:39,985
Scott: It's it's a. it's a solid low b high c kind of show.

585
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:41,930
Scott: It's just fun and shallow.

586
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:42,974
Rym: Yep, I mean the other.

587
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:47,670
Rym: oh, the only other thing I want to bring up before we stop talking about the anime itself was boncho.

588
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:50,760
Scott: Yeah, imagine he was the comic relief kind of character.

589
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:57,922
Rym: this is a show where everyone has a gate like a power They're all little superheroes, but boncho was not a superhero.

590
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:00,890
Rym: He was just some guy who was really intense.

591
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:02,917
Rym: Yeah, that was his superpower.

592
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:04,543
Scott: He's basically like let me join the team.

593
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:06,349
Scott: I'm on the team whether you like it or not.

594
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:07,513
Scott: He's like.

595
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:08,616
Scott: he's like yes.

596
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:09,439
Scott: I have a power.

597
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:10,482
Scott: You just haven't seen it yet.

598
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:10,964
Scott: Blah.

599
00:41:11,044 --> 00:41:12,970
Rym: Yeah guts and that's all he had.

600
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:14,638
Scott: Yeah, his power was guts and he would just.

601
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:17,330
Scott: he was just a tall bigger than the average high school student.

602
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,126
Scott: It was really comic relief.

603
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:21,810
Rym: So Why the hell are we talking about this show then?

604
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,683
Rym: I mean there are better shows coming out now that we're not watching or reviewing.

605
00:41:25,703 --> 00:41:26,606
Rym: so why this?

606
00:41:26,686 --> 00:41:31,059
Scott: well because back in the day As I said before it was one of the first digital fan subs.

607
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,190
Scott: and even if it wasn't the first digital fan sub, right?

608
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,722
Scott: this show Basically, there was a website anime dash factory.

609
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:42,789
Scott: I wonder if that website is still there.

610
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:56,249
Rym: Well while you look it up, I mean the first digital fan sub that really got widely Circulated as far as I was aware was the escaflowne movie and people made a big deal about that and like, oh my god It's a fan sub.

611
00:41:56,459 --> 00:42:02,350
Scott: Yeah Because until then all fan subs were sort of vhs and a lot of people didn't even know what a fan sub.

612
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:04,309
Scott: I didn't know what a fan sub was till I got to rit.

613
00:42:04,932 --> 00:42:25,588
Scott: so the idea of a digital fan sub really hadn't gotten around yet and It wasn't the first one because we did have the escaflowne one before we had the gatekeepers one, but The gatekeepers one was on a website that basically said come here and download gatekeepers episode one with subtitles And watch it on your computer and we'll have episode two soon.

614
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:27,197
Scott: and then they started doing.

615
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:32,321
Scott: boys b was the next show they tried to do and this sort of people saw that and it was sort of.

616
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:37,502
Scott: they realized it clicked like Oh A digital fan sub.

617
00:42:38,045 --> 00:42:48,062
Scott: I get it Oh shit, and just because it happened to be the show that sort of started that Realization process it gained a lot of popularity.

618
00:42:48,122 --> 00:42:50,089
Scott: That was a lot very undeserved.

619
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:53,766
Rym: But actually I think the escaflowne movie was released a little bit after.

620
00:42:53,786 --> 00:42:54,730
Scott: oh, was it really?

621
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,499
Scott: Yeah, so maybe it might have been the first digital fan sub.

622
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:11,390
Rym: I'm just not committing to that because i'm not sure but This show kind of this marks a turning point in anime fandom in the united states like Anime fandom after this show was completely different in a lot of ways.

623
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,995
Scott: I mean basically the anime club.

624
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:16,405
Scott: when this started happening they had to debate at the anime club.

625
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:18,110
Scott: Should we show this?

626
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,734
Scott: You know and it was like a big.

627
00:43:19,754 --> 00:43:23,590
Scott: they had shown tape fan subs before but it's like can we show this?

628
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,773
Scott: Should we show it?

629
00:43:24,793 --> 00:43:28,710
Scott: because in those days, you know the divics and stuff wasn't the same quality it is now.

630
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:33,770
Scott: I mean, well vhs is terrible quality, but you know, there were all sorts of issues like should we show it?

631
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:42,855
Scott: It was a big discussion and it was a major turning point, you know, it was pretty much like it was like, uh, You know They were on one course.

632
00:43:43,156 --> 00:43:47,170
Scott: then this happened and then that's when they started to turn towards the other course.

633
00:43:47,371 --> 00:44:18,850
Rym: I mean I I really gotta stress how much things change because before this for the majority of people who liked anime At rit just because that's an example If you wanted to see Anime that wasn't already released in the us on vhs or dvd and there wasn't that much that was easy to get especially for poor college kids You pretty much had to go to anime clubs And at the anime club the like the eboard would sit and debate and decide What are we going to show these people?

634
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:25,326
Rym: They're a captive audience because this is the only place they can get this stuff easily And then they could check stuff out of the library too.

635
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:32,839
Rym: Yes But at the same time the the club was like there was so much in the library because god We had so many tapes even before digital fan subs.

636
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:33,502
Rym: It was crazy.

637
00:44:33,662 --> 00:44:34,967
Rym: Yeah that there was like.

638
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:35,850
Rym: people needed direction.

639
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:46,750
Rym: So pretty much you'd have two hundred three hundred people come to watch anime Partly because they'd get to see stuff that they'd never heard of had really no easy way of finding out about.

640
00:44:47,213 --> 00:45:02,548
Rym: and the the like the goal of the club was to Show as many different kinds of anime as possible to get people into anime and then after gatekeepers People could go find out about anime on their own and then get it on their own.

641
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,628
Rym: Yep, and there was a lot of talk about.

642
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:09,310
Rym: well How are we going to get people to keep coming to the anime club?

643
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,266
Rym: of course people kept coming and that's probably a topic for a separate show.

644
00:45:13,326 --> 00:45:16,970
Rym: as to how Some anime clubs survived this and many did not.

645
00:45:17,712 --> 00:45:22,550
Scott: Yeah, I think we've talked about that plenty before but you know the the important point is that gatekeepers.

646
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:28,390
Scott: It sort of got the ball rolling ironically enough because the bad guys turned into a giant ball in the first episode.

647
00:45:29,072 --> 00:45:33,830
Rym: It was also a lot of people called it the linux anime because the redhead guy was always the bad guy.

648
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:38,582
Scott: Uh, it's so lame, but everyone I never heard anyone make that joke.

649
00:45:38,723 --> 00:45:39,866
Rym: people made that joke all the time.

650
00:45:39,926 --> 00:45:41,110
Rym: It's rit god.

651
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:44,130
Scott: Oh, let me let me add in a note here gatekeepers has a manga, right?

652
00:45:44,432 --> 00:45:54,580
Scott: And it was a good call by tokyo pop to bring over the gatekeepers Manga because it would be able to sell to the people who had seen the gatekeepers anime Fan subbed based on the title alone and it.

653
00:45:54,882 --> 00:46:05,320
Scott: in fact, I bought volume one way back in the day At full price even though now this is super super super discount bin fodder And rightfully so because it is a terrible manga.

654
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:10,850
Scott: if you think the anime is shallow and nothing The manga is 10 times more shallow and nothing.

655
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,602
Scott: It's basically like you open it up and it's just really.

656
00:46:14,723 --> 00:46:16,930
Scott: it's like meant for like five-year-olds this manga.

657
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:21,754
Scott: It's like attack the bad guy gate open boom The end.

658
00:46:22,175 --> 00:46:23,178
Scott: that's pretty much it.

659
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:24,643
Scott: You don't need to read the manga.

660
00:46:24,964 --> 00:46:26,910
Rym: No, don't forget my fray for two words.

661
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:30,198
Scott: They might enjoy it collateral damage.

662
00:46:30,479 --> 00:46:34,010
Rym: Yeah, but there's another thing about like this show.

663
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:53,516
Rym: The other the revolution of anime fandom was also that up until this point and up until digital fan subs people kind of Took whatever they could get and pretty much any show that people got their hands on they would watch I mean god, we watch legend of lennemere And we watch a lot of bad anime.

664
00:46:53,576 --> 00:47:02,930
Scott: Yeah up until that point in my life, you know any anime that was on any You know, whatever sci-fi channel was showing I was there whatever anime club was showing.

665
00:47:03,251 --> 00:47:07,547
Scott: I think every anime that the anime club showed, you know was like, yes.

666
00:47:07,768 --> 00:47:08,109
Scott: Awesome.

667
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:11,890
Rym: Yes Awesome, and everyone would show up the people who only like giant robot stuff.

668
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:26,389
Scott: They came to see the fancy lala-esque shows because it's anime It's anime, but this as you know within a few months just months because it was still freshman year Right after you know, this sort of this came out.

669
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:35,089
Scott: You know, I was on you know hotline and there was plenty not actually ran a very popular hotline server At rit for a while quite uh.

670
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:43,276
Scott: And you know We were all sharing all these digital fan subs that all of trygun and like real media files and it was all this stuff Going on and like.

671
00:47:43,296 --> 00:47:55,569
Rym: there was this sudden explosion and then all of a sudden A lot of people no longer had interest in one bad anime, but two anime that They on the surface didn't think they'd like.

672
00:47:55,951 --> 00:47:56,132
Rym: Like.

673
00:47:56,433 --> 00:48:00,090
Rym: if we like fancy lala as an example ignore when fancy lala came out or whatever.

674
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:08,010
Rym: But before the fan sub revolution and gatekeepers If we showed fancy lala everyone would come because all right anime the b-board picked it.

675
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:10,589
Rym: It must be good enough to see and I want to see some anime.

676
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:17,510
Rym: after that Fancy lala and people who like magical girls would come and everyone else would say screw it.

677
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:25,647
Rym: I'll stay home and continue watching like fist battler baki And i'll wait for the next fist battler baki like show before I go back to the anime clubs.

678
00:48:25,768 --> 00:48:26,089
Rym: Yep

679
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:42,390
Scott: You know the one more thing gatekeepers actually did is as far as i'm concerned is it was sort of you know It wasn't the first thing that gonzo ever did but it was one of the first uh, tv shows ever Animated by gonzo which is now a pretty big and important studio.

680
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:47,728
Scott: they got their start doing you know video game cutscenes and then gatekeepers one of their first tv shows.

681
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:54,370
Scott: and Gatekeepers really, you know the digital animation techniques used in that are pretty much used in everything today.

682
00:48:54,914 --> 00:49:01,246
Scott: And i'm not I don't think they invented those techniques But that was like one of the first places I ever saw animation.

683
00:49:01,286 --> 00:49:02,150
Scott: that was that shiny.

684
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,182
Scott: Did you see animation that shiny before?

685
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:05,630
Rym: then gatekeepers?

686
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:13,290
Scott: I mean, I see I saw better animation like akira is much better animation than gatekeepers, but it wasn't as shiny.

687
00:49:13,894 --> 00:49:15,830
Scott: You see i'm the shiny does not go better.

688
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:45,005
Rym: This is kind of like how tenchi muyo when american fans saw it There was a big hubbub because it looked so Shiny compared to other anime and it stood out as being like oh my god This was kind of similar that it looked really good and that drew a lot of people to it and gatekeepers Was like so shiny and so eye candy that a lot of people who had never seen this sort of thing before fell hand over foot for it because it just looked so Amazing

689
00:49:45,592 --> 00:49:45,833
Scott: Yep,

690
00:49:45,993 --> 00:49:50,831
Rym: and part of that too was that they just hadn't seen a lot of anime and this was kind of a new thing for Them.

691
00:49:50,951 --> 00:50:04,110
Scott: and I think that because it was one of the first if not the first show to be digitally fan subbed You know and the p I knew that was when I knew who ganzo was like Think about that someone who never really paid attention to who made anime.

692
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:12,129
Scott: I didn't really pay attention to directors other than miyazaki until like a couple years ago Right, like when I started listening when podcasting started coming into being.

693
00:50:12,149 --> 00:50:13,838
Scott: you know An animal order told me.

694
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,005
Scott: Oh, you should pay attention.

695
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:15,528
Scott: I said, oh shit.

696
00:50:15,548 --> 00:50:27,306
Scott: You're right This is the year 2000, but I knew that this was made by studio ganzo because I don't know how that Knowledge like stuck with me, but it did and there was just something about that.

697
00:50:27,346 --> 00:50:28,169
Scott: I don't know what it was.

698
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:33,019
Scott: So I I really I give gatekeepers a lot of credit for so.

699
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:44,829
Scott: well Basically, I think that it had a significant role in bringing studio ganzo to to from being some nobody's made video game Cutscenes to the high profile studio they are today.

700
00:50:45,332 --> 00:50:49,224
Rym: Well, there was also a lot of some fun side stories that you know We talked about.

701
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:55,330
Rym: oh This was a new issue much like when the un has to deal with like a new kind of weapon or a new kind of warfare.

702
00:50:55,892 --> 00:51:12,447
Rym: the anime clubs of the world had to deal with a new kind of anime distribution medium and the the most interesting debate that happened was actually after the fact because there was a sequel to gatekeepers called Gatekeepers 21 i've watched one episode and decided it was garbage.

703
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:12,929
Rym: I don't know.

704
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:16,430
Scott: I watched one episode and I didn't decide it was garbage.

705
00:51:16,795 --> 00:51:17,890
Scott: It seemed like it was a crime.

706
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:25,770
Scott: It seemed like they were trying to ham-fist a show like noir Into the gatekeepers universe in the distant future and it wasn't working so well.

707
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:28,963
Scott: But I don't think it was garbage, but I only watched one episode.

708
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,750
Rym: It really didn't grab me at all.

709
00:51:31,032 --> 00:51:32,405
Scott: I was I didn't watch any more of it.

710
00:51:32,445 --> 00:51:32,889
Scott: That's for sure.

711
00:51:33,211 --> 00:51:49,830
Rym: but there was a crazy controversy about the gatekeepers 21 because we you know, anime clubs we had a lot of policies about what to show and Fan subs were usually deemed Okay because most fan subs weren't released like there are very few fan subs available that were ever released commercially.

712
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,619
Rym: Are there any plans to release commercially?

713
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:53,850
Scott: the issue of the vhs fan sub?

714
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:57,910
Scott: You know was a solved problem long before we ever got to the anime club.

715
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:09,757
Rym: Like we had all these policies to deal with it, but then with these digital fan subs, so gatekeepers 21 someone had laboriously fan subbed it and It this person.

716
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:11,766
Rym: they wanted it to be shown at the rit anime club.

717
00:52:11,786 --> 00:52:12,630
Rym: like look what I did.

718
00:52:13,191 --> 00:52:14,675
Rym: Let's let everyone see this.

719
00:52:15,077 --> 00:52:23,290
Rym: but in between when the fan subbing was completed and when it was to be shown It was announced that it was going to be released commercially.

720
00:52:23,872 --> 00:52:26,582
Scott: Yep, because it's like wow because I didn't you know.

721
00:52:26,983 --> 00:52:28,208
Scott: up until then there weren't.

722
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:31,660
Scott: The commercial releases of anime are few and far between.

723
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:39,350
Scott: we're talking streamline vhs's and such But I mean we're talking like try gun came out on dvd kawa bebop was come was out on dvd.

724
00:52:39,851 --> 00:52:46,189
Scott: That was the beginning of professionally released anime in the us, you know being on dvd and being high quality and awesome.

725
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:50,863
Scott: and There was an announced licensing of gatekeepers gatekeepers 21.

726
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:54,773
Rym: I forget it was gatekeepers 21 is the specific one and We debated.

727
00:52:55,094 --> 00:53:00,910
Rym: we had like this crazy eboard meeting for hours where we debated whether or not we should show it.

728
00:53:01,231 --> 00:53:03,718
Rym: And then if we show it what's the rationale?

729
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:07,730
Rym: if we don't show it what's the rationale what is our policy going forward?

730
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,093
Rym: What like?

731
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:27,369
Rym: we had to worry about this because it was a new thing and we didn't know what to do and we eventually came upon the kind of golden rule of anime clubs that still holds true to a large degree today, which was that We decided that as long as the show had not been given a street date as in there was.

732
00:53:27,429 --> 00:53:29,397
Rym: no We have the license.

733
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,190
Rym: it is going to be released as of this day.

734
00:53:33,212 --> 00:53:40,751
Rym: We wouldn't wait until it was released because that was kind of crap because but We wait until they said it was going to be released and they said like it's going to be this day or this month Yeah,

735
00:53:40,771 --> 00:53:44,587
Scott: because someone could buy the license to something and then never release it.

736
00:53:44,648 --> 00:53:59,909
Scott: and we you know There was a sort of feeling that well if they're going to do that then You know There's a chance that they won't ever release it which is actually something that did happen way back in those days Not like now where they license something and it almost always gets released except, you know Even more recently the trend is reversed.

737
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:12,110
Scott: So, you know if there was a if unless they said the dvd will be available volume one on this date Then that meant there was a chance that they were just going to hold on to the license and never release it.

738
00:54:12,373 --> 00:54:20,270
Scott: So he said in that case It's still okay for us to show a fan sub because this could be like, you know Lost art that no one will be able to see because someone's hoarding the license.

739
00:54:20,501 --> 00:54:26,910
Rym: Yep Now pursuant to that was the general policy that we'd never really showed whole shows and we kind of pointedly avoided.

740
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:32,526
Rym: We never actually addressed the issue, but we never showed a marathon Of a fan sub.

741
00:54:32,668 --> 00:54:39,750
Rym: no We would show the first four episodes because if nothing else that did All that did is generate more interest in the actual commercial release.

742
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:43,604
Scott: whenever we did a marathon of an entire show would always be the real dvds.

743
00:54:44,126 --> 00:54:48,024
Rym: now I to go over this very briefly.

744
00:54:48,446 --> 00:55:06,615
Rym: back then Industry relations in terms of fan clubs were kind of different from they were today and we'd always you know we got like legal permission to show things and all this sort of and we had the Implicit and tacit a kind of approval of our policies by the anime Quote-unquote industry.

745
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:16,470
Rym: at the time there was kind of a yeah, they won't say that though But we we had a lot of working relationship with many industry people and the policy then was an unspoken.

746
00:55:17,331 --> 00:55:22,750
Rym: As long as you follow the rules, you said you're following we will never bother you about your the way you show fans.

747
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:24,537
Scott: Yeah, this is a long time ago though.

748
00:55:24,618 --> 00:55:25,301
Scott: So don't it won't.

749
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:26,325
Scott: it's not the same today.

750
00:55:26,546 --> 00:55:27,430
Rym: It's totally different now.

751
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,260
Rym: Now the other issue was all right.

752
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,070
Rym: We had a gigantic anime library.

753
00:55:31,852 --> 00:55:32,661
Rym: Do we allow?

754
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,301
Rym: Digital fan subs in the library and if so in what capacity?

755
00:55:37,321 --> 00:55:39,830
Rym: and that that argument lasted for months.

756
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:40,372
Scott: Yeah, they would.

757
00:55:40,412 --> 00:55:45,810
Scott: they I think eventually like they took some digital fan subs and transferred them to vhs and put them in the library.

758
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:51,569
Rym: But that died out and eventually actually became moot before we came up with a policy on how to deal with it.

759
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:58,170
Rym: Everyone just downloaded their own fan subs and the only purpose of the library then was to get legitimate releases.

760
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,666
Rym: Yeah, they eventually old old like vhs releases of.

761
00:56:01,686 --> 00:56:10,030
Scott: like rupan Yep, they eventually just started You know buying dvds and throw and replacing all the fans of vhs's that you know had dvd replacements.

762
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:19,789
Rym: Of course right about then was when scott johnson was in the process of being the best goddamn librarian ever In terms of getting enough money from rit to buy the sick amount of dvds that we had.

763
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:25,995
Scott: man He like the library was pretty big when I joined the anime club scott It was in these cabinets.

764
00:56:26,035 --> 00:56:30,269
Scott: They had these eight cabinets and the club library filled the cabinets, but that was it.

765
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:41,030
Scott: Scott johnson got added so many tapes to the library that not only did he fill those cabinets all the way He completely covered like three or four long tables.

766
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:46,410
Rym: Yes, like our office was basically just full of dvd and vhs tapes.

767
00:56:46,692 --> 00:56:48,746
Scott: It was it was quite a thing to see.

768
00:56:48,766 --> 00:56:54,750
Rym: and then scott Johnson was the like emperor justinian of the rit anime club library something along those lines.

769
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:55,893
Rym: Yes, I remember.

770
00:56:55,953 --> 00:57:02,250
Rym: and then the worst thing is our method of dealing with like inventory was basically this little notebook.

771
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:02,872
Scott: Yep,

772
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:13,793
Rym: and we revolute we me and him sat there for like two days straight one weekend Recat catalogizing I'm gonna say catalogizing

773
00:57:13,813 --> 00:57:15,117
Scott: taking inventory of

774
00:57:15,277 --> 00:57:27,950
Rym: not just that but making the whole new system of taking inventory and relabeling Everything and the shit I got for the next three years because my g's look too much like o's and my handwriting was bad.

775
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:33,830
Scott: Screw you you guys you guys didn't help me at all and gatekeepers was an instigator of the whole thing.

776
00:57:34,373 --> 00:57:35,822
Rym: I don't know what else we really have to say.

777
00:57:35,863 --> 00:57:41,770
Rym: I mean, there's a lot of Intimate little details about fan subs and gatekeepers and things that you probably don't care about.

778
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:49,500
Rym: I don't think I want to get into the specifics of the arguments that we had in the club or Like just the reactions and all those crazy things.

779
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,070
Rym: I think you get the overview of what was going on at that time.

780
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:53,112
Scott: All right.

781
00:57:53,633 --> 00:58:03,907
Scott: Uh, all I gotta say now is that uh, I have received what appears to be Uh one more valid entry into the goon saga manga contest.

782
00:58:04,168 --> 00:58:19,009
Scott: Oh snap I am going to judge the valid entries this week and I will announce a winner Next wednesday on the show, but if you send in a valid entry between today and next wednesday I will enter it into the judging.

783
00:58:19,574 --> 00:58:21,447
Scott: So right now you got a one out of three.

784
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:24,963
Scott: I think there's three entries and two of them are valid so far.

785
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,770
Rym: so you'll win the goon saga manga.

786
00:58:26,911 --> 00:58:29,883
Scott: Your chances are good of winning if you send in a valid entry.

793
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:50,364
Rym: We just had a lot of other things going on like gaming for hope which is the same.

794
00:58:50,384 --> 00:58:51,629
Scott: how much you're gonna give away now?

795
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:58,090
