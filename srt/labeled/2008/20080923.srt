1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,926
Rym: It's Tuesday September 23rd.

2
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:12,668
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:17,804
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight part 3 of our penny arcade expo 2008 coverage Sunday.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,915
Rym: Let's do this

5
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:44,360
Scott: Alright, so there actually is a lot of video game and other game news going down But there's so much of it, and you know I feel you know because he'd done these three packed shows in a row I've had such a small no opportunity basically to talk about games.

6
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:55,220
Scott: Actually playing right now instead of a news I just sort of want to Relatively quickly go over all the games that are going on in my life right now because I am playing mad games.

7
00:00:55,622 --> 00:01:05,199
Rym: Mad games yes, and particularly I got to point out It wasn't two years ago But I remember talking about PC gaming was pretty much dead and it really was two years now.

8
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:08,511
Rym: PC Gaming is full-on now like it came back and remember.

9
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:10,760
Rym: I never said it can't come back.

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,813
Rym: I just said at that point it was dead and it's been slowly like coming back.

11
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:19,588
Scott: It was just MMOs, but now Thanks to a lot of indie games.

12
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:21,012
Rym: You know what ever since portal.

13
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:24,864
Rym: Yeah, it was like portal and now I got so Multi-winning.

14
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,972
Scott: yeah, oh you want to multi-winning first alright.

15
00:01:26,992 --> 00:01:27,132
Scott: Well.

16
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:29,160
Rym: I'm playing multi-winning yeah, so it's great.

17
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:38,436
Scott: Yeah, so back there was a game called Darwinia by this company introversion if people don't know introversion They're a British game developer, and they made uplink which everyone should play.

18
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:40,464
Scott: even though I suck at it I can't beat it cuz I suck.

19
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:41,950
Scott: they made Darwinia.

20
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,118
Scott: They made Defcon and they're making multi-winning.

21
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:56,019
Scott: yeah, basically Darwinia was an RTS unlike no other RTS, but it was single-player and Originally they wanted it to be multiplayer, but they failed and they only made a single-player game.

22
00:01:56,461 --> 00:02:02,165
Scott: multi-winning is what Darwinia was originally going to be a multiplayer RTS.

23
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:09,434
Scott: that isn't like other RTS's and I gotta say I suck at RTS's But multi-winning after playing it a bit.

24
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:11,665
Scott: I'm actually Okay at it.

25
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:12,046
Scott: I can.

26
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:15,699
Scott: I couldn't play Defcon really that well at least against other human beings.

27
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,629
Rym: well I could play no Scott, and I against each other is fun.

28
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:20,715
Rym: Yeah, because we both suck equally.

29
00:02:21,076 --> 00:02:29,236
Rym: so it's just like yay And then one of us wins by a little bit, but multi-winning I can actually play and it's actually really good.

30
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:32,811
Rym: well because it's you Know I like the idea and this I think you know.

31
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:39,158
Rym: there's that article a while ago about how Games from 10 15 years ago Hold up today.

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,981
Rym: but yet the majority like a lot most games from now will not hold up 10 to 15 years from now because they're just Tech.

33
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:50,800
Rym: they are not at the limits of their technology and incremental improvements make previous versions obsolete.

34
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:53,229
Rym: I mean Soulcalibur 1 was a good game.

35
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,213
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

36
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:56,039
Rym: It was like a revolutionary fighting game.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,346
Rym: Soulcalibur 2 is just better.

38
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:02,241
Scott: Yeah, it's just an incremental improvement over Soulcalibur 1.

39
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:07,496
Scott: Soulcalibur 1 is you know but why play Soulcalibur 1 but like to exist?

40
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:13,300
Rym: excite bike or Tetris is a distilled game that technology could not beg better.

41
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,860
Rym: You could make a different game, but that game is distilled.

42
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,165
Scott: Yeah, what could you make?

43
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:22,440
Scott: excite bike 2 in such a way that no one would ever want to play excite bike 1?

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,455
Scott: I guess excite bike verse is that but I mean it's the same game.

45
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:27,980
Scott: basically is the same game.

46
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:36,160
Rym: I want to talk about that idea more at length because I actually have a lot to say about it And you know it might not be all the things you expect me to say about but the thing about multi winnia, right?

47
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,111
Scott: We'll just get this over.

48
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:37,860
Scott: It's distilled.

49
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:38,264
Rym: Yeah,

50
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:42,516
Scott: multi winnia is an RTS But it doesn't have that part of the game where you

51
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:43,140
Rym: click

52
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:46,874
Scott: Faster than the other person in order to upgrade your guys fast the other poor

53
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:51,885
Rym: in order to because they get like a lot of RTS is don't really support Squatting or of that AI.

54
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:56,520
Rym: you basically whoever can click the fastest to move their units into the right positions quick enough wins.

55
00:03:56,801 --> 00:04:00,362
Scott: Yeah, multi winnia is all about Moving.

56
00:04:00,502 --> 00:04:03,151
Scott: it's all about controlling the flow of your units.

57
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:04,616
Scott: You know in a way.

58
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:08,960
Scott: It's a lot more like Trying to think of another game.

59
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:20,733
Rym: In many ways it's more like real warfare in that you you have you know you can give orders and send guys around But it's real time and you know information propagates slowly.

60
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:25,860
Rym: like you change your guy flow It takes a while for guys to start arriving at that new front.

61
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:34,819
Scott: Yeah, you're basically controlling a flow of units and aiming it and you know moving it around in such a way as to win depending on the scenario.

62
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,105
Scott: and It's actually in a way.

63
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:45,940
Scott: It's a lot like that liquid Tron you ever play that actually yeah It's a little bit like the liquid Tron where you're controlling this flow of liquid in order to sort of Tron the other guy out.

64
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,887
Rym: But I mean, let's not talk about the game at like People hate.

65
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:54,659
Rym: RTS is however the new just so you know Basically when it came to writing the network part of it.

66
00:04:55,162 --> 00:05:00,684
Rym: They screwed the pooch and like a lot of people can't play the game online and land play Con

67
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:09,080
Scott: and similar problems, but this seems to have problems twice as bad Which is really sad because it's multi winnia, but the multiplayer is broken seriously

68
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:13,620
Rym: And it's not like it's really broken and a lot of people are having trouble with it.

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,740
Rym: And I like Scott and I were unable to why they just use the built-in steam game matching stuff.

70
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:20,447
Scott: I don't know.

71
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:21,779
Rym: actually I noticed something weird.

72
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:28,380
Rym: Once I installed multi winnia none of my steam multiplayer games worked online.

73
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:41,280
Rym: I got connection attempt failed on all of them until I Restarted and when I was back in like closing steam and opening again It still didn't work, but once I restarted my computer into Windows it worked fine again for everything.

74
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,808
Scott: I didn't have that kind of problem.

75
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:47,892
Rym: so no, but I'm saying now that I've rebooted We should try doing multi winnia LAN again.

76
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:48,595
Rym: Maybe it'll work.

77
00:05:48,877 --> 00:05:51,265
Rym: Okay like Something weird with steam.

78
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:51,887
Rym: I don't know.

79
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:55,080
Rym: I'm sure the details and hopefully a fix will come out anyway.

80
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:56,706
Scott: So yeah, what else?

81
00:05:56,847 --> 00:06:00,240
Scott: Oh bionic commander rearmed still didn't beat it on normal.

82
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:03,099
Scott: Yeah, all I got to say once you don't have to play the co-op.

83
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:06,213
Rym: I think it's the best game to come out since portal.

84
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:07,097
Scott: Yeah, it's.

85
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:07,900
Scott: it's really good.

86
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,855
Scott: I don't know if it's the best.

87
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:10,898
Scott: well There's so many other good games on this list.

88
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,217
Rym: yes But name a better game on the PC that that is played right now by people right.

89
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:19,450
Scott: this second I guess you have to wait for Left 4 Dead to come out.

90
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:19,892
Rym: Yes.

91
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:20,877
Rym: Yeah, it hasn't come out.

92
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:29,908
Scott: Yeah, anyway anyway Castlevania Symphony tonight, I've played the DS, and I was trying to play the GBA Castlevania's, but I failed at that.

93
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,738
Rym: You know you have a couple of Chris Agram's.

94
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:31,940
Rym: yet.

95
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:39,544
Scott: No, I don't have any Chris Agram's Chris But I just you know I got the PlayStation emulator working, and I'm playing the symphony tonight Which I never played before.

96
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:41,671
Rym: and now this is another example of.

97
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:44,380
Rym: it is an incredibly amazing and important game.

98
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,480
Rym: I mean that basically was a revolution in that sort of game, but at the same time it suffers.

99
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:55,840
Rym: Well, it doesn't suffer, but the genre will eventually suffer from the incremental improvement.

100
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:59,700
Scott: No Well, there's no because that is actually an instance in which there is no increment.

101
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,860
Scott: Well what I was about to say every single game is exactly the same.

102
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,137
Scott: It's just more of the same which is exactly what you want.

103
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:09,134
Rym: well I was what I you didn't let me finish because I was saying something.

104
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,660
Rym: I was having a qualified statement.

105
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:19,547
Rym: But each of these games has enough unique character to where playing an older one is Just as fun as playing a newer one.

106
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:21,494
Scott: There's no unique character.

107
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:23,240
Scott: They're all exactly the same game.

108
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,237
Scott: It's just a different map.

109
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,250
Scott: well There is like if someone has got there is unique character.

110
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,300
Rym: the maps are different the characters are different the music and all that like.

111
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,947
Rym: The atmosphere is different Totally different.

112
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:35,599
Scott: the weapons are mostly the same.

113
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:41,500
Scott: All these games are pretty much is more of the same game, and they're all awesome because you can't get enough.

114
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:44,770
Scott: It's like if someone just made Super Metroid with a different map.

115
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:46,535
Scott: you couldn't get enough of that.

116
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:48,240
Rym: everyone has a unique gimmick.

117
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:49,403
Rym: I mean the.

118
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:52,332
Rym: the first DS one had the swapping loadouts gimmick.

119
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:56,879
Rym: the second one had the two people gimmick and each Gimmick is ain't it of itself fun?

120
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:58,930
Scott: It was that the gimmicks barely play into it.

121
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,518
Scott: the gimmicks are not what make the game is fun.

122
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:03,179
Rym: the gimmick I know I would disagree and say that they they.

123
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:08,220
Rym: They give each game a very unique character to where each one is independently amazing.

124
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:13,260
Rym: Yeah, however the the symphony tonight has the gimmick of it's not first one.

125
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:16,889
Rym: Anyway, also the soundtrack is amazing.

126
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,137
Scott: Yeah, well cuz it was actually on a CD.

127
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:21,647
Scott: So they actually Say it's amazing.

128
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:27,060
Rym: I say it's amazing because the music Even if it was never in a game is really good music.

129
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:29,800
Scott: Well the point that's what I'm saying is that back in those days?

130
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:36,590
Scott: Games are on CDs and all what they could do with a CD in those days was Put really good music on it.

131
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,419
Scott: cuz CDs originally for music.

132
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,427
Rym: But no in those days like is good.

133
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:52,964
Rym: in the same way that a lot of Final Fantasy guest soundtracks were good because it was basically semi symphonic or symphonic music composed for the game as opposed to when they CDs for games.

134
00:08:53,305 --> 00:09:03,320
Scott: in those days they because that was their advantage especially on something like the Sega CD and the PlayStation early days They tried really hard to make really good music Scott.

135
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Rym: They tried really hard to make really good music for SNES games to some games.

136
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:16,340
Rym: I mean, yeah the Final Fantasy soundtrack Final Fantasy 6 Had an amazing soundtrack because it was composed for the game and it took a lot of time and effort.

137
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,645
Rym: But I feel like most games their soundtracks are generic Background music.

138
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:29,613
Scott: nowadays people don't try hard to make really good music for their game Like music from Halo and it's just kind of generic it like.

139
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:38,440
Rym: I wouldn't listen to it on its own But I would listen to the soundtrack to Symphony of the Night or the composed music for Final Fantasy 6 on its own.

140
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:39,472
Rym: It's fantastic.

141
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,827
Rym: Yep Megaman 9.

142
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:44,596
Scott: Alright, so Megaman 9 came out.

143
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:45,219
Scott: I bought it.

144
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,896
Scott: I played barely any of it yet, but it's Megaman 9.

145
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:51,120
Scott: Do I really need to say anything else?

146
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,153
Rym: I got to say one thing you can turn on or turn off sprite flicker.

147
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:56,117
Scott: That's cool.

148
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:59,306
Rym: And uh, I'm doing what Scott is doing.

149
00:09:59,346 --> 00:09:59,808
Rym: We're both.

150
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,740
Rym: we're not going to read anything about the game.

151
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:11,360
Scott: We're going to play it independently of each other and independently of Each other because I mean you want to get the old NES experience as part of the old NES experience.

152
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:22,313
Rym: Oh, you want to do that watching what your friend did and learning from that, you know Anything to learn from you though, so I will say this though in the playing I've done I'm going to start with Splash Woman.

153
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,989
Rym: I Think that is where I should start.

154
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,899
Scott: I think that's just cuz you like Splash Woman.

155
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,214
Rym: Well, yes, because she is fairly attractive, but that is not the main reason.

156
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:31,420
Scott: What else is your reason?

157
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,360
Rym: My main reason is that my regular gun did more damage to her than he did to other people.

158
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:38,003
Rym: How far did you get?

159
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:42,176
Rym: I got to her and I also got to gem man.

160
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:43,620
Scott: You actually got the gem man.

161
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,184
Rym: Yes, you know what?

162
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:44,787
Rym: I couldn't beat him.

163
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:45,915
Rym: I got there with zero lives.

164
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:46,700
Rym: He kicked my ass.

165
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:49,460
Scott: I kept dying on the stupid spikes where the swingy thing is.

166
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,470
Rym: I lost all but one of my lives.

167
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,520
Rym: cuz I got an extra life on that part.

168
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:56,280
Scott: Is he on the other side of that gate or is someone else in the side of the gate?

169
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,432
Rym: I feel like I shouldn't say.

170
00:10:57,452 --> 00:11:01,933
Rym: Oh, yeah anyway We're gonna do a review of Megaman 9.

171
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,899
Rym: Obviously the game is Exactly what we wanted.

172
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:14,480
Rym: It's pretty much Megaman 2 but new and I'm getting the experience like the joy of Discovery and like all these feelings that I haven't had in a game in a long time.

173
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:18,599
Rym: Yeah, like I never got a joy of discovery playing portrait of Roo and I just kind of beat it.

174
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,675
Rym: Yeah, but this game it's like I'm trying to get some of that joy discovery.

175
00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:23,960
Scott: It's in me the night actually.

176
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,799
Rym: Yeah, well simply the night is like an amazing game, right?

177
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,509
Scott: So I got the strong bad game on the Wii.

178
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:30,152
Scott: the first one.

179
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:33,580
Scott: actually the second one is out You know, but I haven't gotten that one.

180
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,420
Scott: I only got the first one and I didn't beat the first one, but I played quite a bit of it.

181
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,080
Scott: Actually, it's a point-and-click adventure with strong bad their homestar runner style jokes.

182
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,177
Scott: That's pretty much all there is to it.

183
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:49,020
Scott: I mean, you know if you if you like homestar runner go for it.

184
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,280
Scott: And actually what I did is I haven't gone to home.

185
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,784
Scott: So I was a fan of homestar runner.

186
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:55,572
Scott: back before you people even knew anyone's.

187
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:58,466
Rym: Scott sent an email that became one of the strong Matty.

188
00:11:58,527 --> 00:11:58,977
Scott: remember that.

189
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:08,850
Rym: well I'm pretty sure that first email where his computer explodes was Eerily similar to an email that I said like it was almost word for word like a couple of words were changed but it was like word for word.

190
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:16,200
Rym: otherwise, yes, and That's how far we go back like we like we started watching from like the third strong bad email.

191
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:20,580
Scott: Yeah, when I went to the site originally strong bad email was not the highlight of the site.

192
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:22,489
Scott: It was just one of the features on the site.

193
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,840
Scott: the tunes and the games were more prominent.

194
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,006
Scott: Anyway, so I hadn't.

195
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:36,591
Scott: I eventually got tired of it because the same joke over and over again, you know And I felt like around the time when the album came out was sort of like the peak And I hadn't gone there in a long time.

196
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:40,460
Scott: So bringing back this game I feel like playing the first chapter of it.

197
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,889
Scott: It's sort of like I sort of like a joke.

198
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,740
Scott: you've heard the joke before but you haven't heard it in such a long time.

199
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,360
Scott: So it's sort of funny again in a way and it sort of worked for me.

200
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,740
Scott: I don't know if I'd buy the second episode, but I'll probably go and beat the first episode.

201
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:59,580
Scott: It does have some of that adventure game problem of there's no logic to what to do next.

202
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:02,300
Scott: So it's use everything on everything until you win.

203
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:06,520
Scott: So I think at this point I'm just gonna use a fact to beat it out and just see all the jokes.

204
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,160
Rym: But the game the game is funny like it's really funny.

205
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:09,966
Scott: Yeah, it is.

206
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:12,000
Scott: It's funny now because I haven't heard those jokes in a while.

207
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,605
Scott: But I don't know if episode 2 will be funny.

208
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:17,839
Rym: Maybe it all started when I drank 49 glasses of marinade.

209
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:21,660
Scott: Maybe when I wait a long time and then play episode 2 will be funny again.

210
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:27,397
Rym: All I have to say is to this day home star like I will crack up uncontrollably at home sour.

211
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:35,679
Scott: Yeah Almost as much as the bees Wario Wario shake it which I played at PAX is gonna be in the mail real soon.

212
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,060
Scott: Amazon.

213
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,128
Rym: We already talked about that in our bags coverage.

214
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:41,320
Scott: I'm playing Mega Man ZX on the DS.

215
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,671
Scott: I don't know people realize this.

216
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:49,980
Scott: on the GBA There's Mega Man zero one Mega Man zero two Mega Man zero three and Mega Man zero four.

217
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:59,980
Scott: They're all really good and really hard Mega Man games that are sort of different from the Mega Man X games But more similar to the X games than they are to the you know, regular Mega Man games.

218
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:11,495
Scott: But they're really good and the people who made those games are the people who made Mega Man 9. on the DS There's Mega Man ZX and Mega Man ZX advent and I've been playing Mega Man ZX.

219
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:17,640
Scott: It is really good Really good game and it's also made by that same team at Capcom.

220
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:32,817
Rym: So if you're a Mega Man fan, you owe it to yourself to not ignore these portable Mega Man Z's and ZX's Seriously, so before we get into PAX I have to bring this up because I saw this screenshot like right as the news was announced.

221
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:37,712
Scott: I didn't see the news and It's not a joke, I thought it was the scariest part.

222
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:38,896
Rym: I didn't even think it was a joke.

223
00:14:38,997 --> 00:14:39,880
Rym: I thought it was satire.

224
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,720
Rym: I thought it was someone making the point that I like I would always make.

225
00:14:45,400 --> 00:15:01,954
Rym: basically, it's a picture of you know World of Warcraft and inside of World of Warcraft Someone has opened a bejeweled window and is playing bejeweled and I saw it and I assumed ha This is someone making fun of World of Warcraft And I don't think I need to say anything other than that.

226
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:03,079
Rym: This is not a joke.

227
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,440
Rym: They're literally adding bejeweled.

228
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:14,920
Rym: But you know the mindless crap game Into World of Warcraft so that people have something to do while they're grinding.

229
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:19,920
Scott: So in other words, I mean, what's the point of a game?

230
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:31,420
Scott: I mean really, you know The primary purpose of a game like World of Warcraft is to entertain people so they can keep their minds Occupied to pass the time and entertain themselves, right?

231
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,006
Scott: See, but they've made something right.

232
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:48,888
Scott: that you pay a monthly fee for this thing to entertain you yet this thing You're that you're paying a monthly fee to entertain yourself with is so boring that they have to give you Something else to entertain yourself with.

233
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:49,751
Scott: now what I want.

234
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,677
Scott: this other thing is boring you.

235
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,546
Rym: what I would say Is that we have some.

236
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:55,700
Rym: you know, a lot of people in the crew actually play Wow.

237
00:15:56,043 --> 00:16:04,349
Rym: I can't understand why but I Note that almost without exception when they talk about Wow They will often talk about how they'll have like.

238
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:12,339
Rym: they'll be watching a movie while they play or they'll be playing Another game while they play like a lot of people like yeah, I'll be playing Civ 4 while I play Wow

239
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,451
Scott: but I don't get yeah,

240
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:22,357
Rym: but basically The irony of putting bejeweled in World of Warcraft is delicious.

241
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:28,360
Scott: It is Absolutely, but they're basically saying our game is so they're admitting our game is boring.

242
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:34,340
Scott: Here is another game to occupy you while our game is boring so that I please don't stop playing our board.

243
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,960
Rym: I think joystick said it best.

244
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:44,780
Rym: There are many ways to deal with boredom that can strike during lengthy World of Warcraft sessions Other than just walking away from the computer to partake in a more enjoyable activity.

245
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,707
Rym: Some people level up new characters.

246
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:52,939
Rym: some people go into a barons area and spear their heat speed short like my discoundrels.

247
00:16:54,123 --> 00:17:00,020
Rym: One the virtual denizens of Azeroth will soon be wasting their time using a popular real lifetime wasting engine.

248
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,594
Scott: And do you get XP's are playing bejeweled?

249
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:03,379
Rym: I don't think so.

250
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:04,865
Scott: They show it at least.

251
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:08,339
Scott: then maybe it'd be faster than killing rats to grind, right?

252
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,988
Scott: I just I would just play bejeweled to level.

253
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,119
Rym: I say it should increase the drop rates of perps.

254
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:20,428
Rym: things of the day.

255
00:17:21,252 --> 00:17:25,324
Scott: So, you know us we like to think about games in an academic fashion.

256
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:27,569
Rym: Oh, yes, most definitely most definitely.

257
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:37,423
Scott: Well in my internet Wanderings today, you know bored at work usual usual I came across this essay or I don't know.

258
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:39,410
Scott: they call it an introductory catalog.

259
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:43,995
Scott: it's a it's a five-part essay basically and what it is?

260
00:17:44,095 --> 00:18:03,540
Scott: it's called the arts of contest and It was written for the exhibition of oriental games in New York in 2004 by a name a man named David Parlette and I read this thing and it's in five parts and Each part sort of covers a different area.

261
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:14,742
Scott: and you know in the beginning the first part He really talks about how games are actually really important historically and should be respected And people shouldn't be looking down on him.

262
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:15,990
Rym: I can definitely agree with that.

263
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,316
Rym: I mean war games in Prussia is one of the reasons why the Prussians had the Pre-eminent military of the day.

264
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:24,947
Scott: and he talks about nowadays, you know people, you know think oh, it's just.

265
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:28,722
Scott: it's just a game It's not important or you know, they're just.

266
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:33,318
Scott: you know, it's just a silly game To demean something by calling it a game.

267
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,080
Rym: It is important.

268
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,330
Rym: I mean if you lose a game of Puerto Rico people fucking die.

269
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,077
Scott: That's right.

270
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:38,601
Scott: That's right.

271
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:39,348
Scott: It's serious business.

272
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,016
Scott: Anyway, yeah, but then he goes on to talk about.

273
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:53,750
Scott: you know other more different and interesting things and if you're someone who cares about Games for serious like we do then this is something that you should read.

274
00:18:53,790 --> 00:19:07,376
Scott: It's not you know, the most deep the most full You know hardcore thing you're ever gonna read but it's a. it's a little better than your average Crap that you read on your gaming vlogs.

275
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,422
Rym: Well, it's definitely an important point.

276
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:41,689
Rym: I mean actually seriously not that long ago I did a lecture about Game theory and gaming and how by playing games that are game theory kind of games as opposed to just monopoly You know games that don't matter games that actually involve tactical thought or strategic thought or anything like that that have non-trivial decisions are very good for honing your ability to deal with the real world more effectively and to make better decisions as a whole and to think quickly and all those sorts of things and I Have a feeling because I didn't read this thing of the day yet, but I have a feeling I'll agree with this, dude

277
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:43,676
Scott: Yeah, I didn't read the whole thing either.

278
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:47,570
Scott: That's why I only talked about part one, but I have something much more important now.

279
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:49,575
Rym: We over the weekend.

280
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:56,053
Rym: We were reminded suddenly and with fury that the movie Dick Tracy with Warren Beatty Exists.

281
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:06,250
Scott: I saw that movie in the movie theaters Double feature I believe with a gremlins movie perhaps gremlins - ah, I saw it by itself.

282
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,470
Rym: I don't remember the end.

283
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,474
Rym: My mom was like.

284
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:12,090
Rym: she wasn't sure if she should say anything about Madonna and the way she was dancing.

285
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,617
Scott: Yeah, I was a kid.

286
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:15,542
Scott: I didn't know her care.

287
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:16,810
Rym: I knew I cared.

288
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:20,148
Rym: I just I could see my mom trying to figure out what to say to me after the movie.

289
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:22,539
Scott: Yeah, my parents didn't say.

290
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,093
Rym: thing is I forgot that the movie was put out by Disney And I forgot that.

291
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:29,201
Rym: as far as I remember it was a fantastic movie.

292
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:38,090
Rym: The movie is definitely badass times 10, however I talked not that long ago about jmvs, but there's another phenomenon out there.

293
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,556
Rym: I think I have to talk about the DTMV.

294
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:45,670
Rym: this here is a Dick Tracy music video set to straight out of Compton.

295
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:47,744
Scott: Well, I'd yet to say what it was said to.

296
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:48,489
Scott: he gave it away.

297
00:20:49,353 --> 00:20:50,638
Rym: Why cuz the video is the thing.

298
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:52,124
Rym: usually it's they'll watch it and go.

299
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:53,590
Rym: Oh straight out of Compton.

300
00:20:53,690 --> 00:21:00,809
Rym: But now this time I just want you to watch the video because I am pretty sure that the majority of our listeners Have never seen this movie.

301
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:03,579
Rym: I'll bet that half of them didn't even know it existed.

302
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:06,209
Scott: They should have just used the same song as the jmv.

303
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:15,030
Rym: Yeah Now I think see I wish someone made a Dick Tracy song just like that jmv song the baddest motherfucker in the world.

304
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:21,906
Rym: But because that's not terribly game related and because the angry video game nerd recently talked about it.

305
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,410
Rym: I got a double feature.

306
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:29,560
Rym: so Because this is a good thing of the day I have a bad thing of the day.

307
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,398
Rym: You see Dick Tracy for the NES It's one of the worst games ever made.

308
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:38,459
Scott: if I didn't even know it existed that I saw the anger video game nerd do his Little thing about it and I was like, oh my god.

309
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:39,042
Rym: I owned it.

310
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:40,590
Scott: I owe you really.

311
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,605
Rym: Yes, I bought it from a blockbuster for like 20 bucks.

312
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:47,192
Rym: Oh, man, I Never.

313
00:21:47,212 --> 00:21:49,340
Scott: you said I'm buying a command.

314
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,469
Rym: I'd never arrested anyone.

315
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:52,734
Rym: I died.

316
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:53,577
Rym: that game sucked.

317
00:21:53,837 --> 00:21:54,600
Rym: it was impossible.

318
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,370
Rym: But anyway one you should watch the angry video game nerd about it.

319
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:05,689
Rym: But - I have a video here of what you get when you win this game Which of course is moot because it's impossible to beat this game.

320
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:08,603
Scott: But they get a video game genie brah.

321
00:22:08,905 --> 00:22:13,084
Rym: Actually, I remember as a kid I did beat it by using a game genie code that made you invincible.

322
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,330
Scott: Oh, that could help.

323
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:25,610
Rym: that's pretty much the only reason he couldn't beat it, but Let me tell you what I've noticed that games that suck tend to also have Incredibly unrewarding and unsatisfying ending.

324
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:30,850
Scott: I know it's like the game is the hardest to beat gives you the like the pieces to shit for beating it.

325
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,314
Rym: But you know what?

326
00:22:31,354 --> 00:22:31,839
Rym: I get mr.

327
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:32,949
Rym: Miyagi winking at me.

328
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:38,306
Scott: Yeah by these incredibly easy games at the end of it like this full motion video Because it's just.

329
00:22:38,347 --> 00:22:39,633
Scott: you know The game has no substance.

330
00:22:39,653 --> 00:22:40,456
Scott: to just video.

331
00:22:40,596 --> 00:22:52,548
Rym: suffice to say you get the same graphic you get when the cops yelling at you for Arresting the wrong dude, but the text says great job dick Arrested the right dude, and then you see one picture him at his desk and that's it.

332
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:56,601
Scott: That's it What we had to do some Dick Tracy comics on a Wednesday.

333
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:01,033
Rym: Oh, yes, we do because I got to say Dick Tracy Badass mofo.

334
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:02,398
Scott: Oh, yeah in the world.

335
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,078
Rym: So, uh speaking of badass mofos I think we got to finish our coverage of packs.

336
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:11,730
Rym: It's been a while since packs and yet we're still talking.

337
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,288
Scott: That's cuz you're not doing enough shows.

338
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,017
Scott: Maybe we did more shows.

339
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:16,263
Scott: He would have been done with this by now.

340
00:23:16,323 --> 00:23:17,770
Rym: Do you want to do four shows a week?

341
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:23,838
Rym: If I didn't have a job, I see how that is But I think it is telling.

342
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:28,077
Rym: I mean if you didn't listen to any of our other coverage of facts And you don't plan to listen to the show tonight.

343
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:28,719
Rym: I'll sum it up.

344
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:31,550
Rym: We've done three episodes about packs.

345
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:34,884
Rym: You can probably figure out whether or not it was good.

346
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:38,959
Scott: Yeah, you don't need to listen All right, you just we did three shows about it.

347
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,970
Scott: Would we do three shows about a bad convention?

348
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:57,530
Rym: Question why of course, but anyway, I guess the intent of these episodes especially after listening to all the feedback we've been getting from the previous to is That it is not so much for people who want to know the details of packs or been to a packs.

349
00:23:57,851 --> 00:24:01,690
Rym: It is for people who are unable to attend packs who wish to live it vicariously.

350
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:07,305
Scott: It's also for people who were at packs to relive it vicarious.

351
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,134
Rym: I believe the word of the day is Vicariously.

352
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:11,766
Scott: what is vicarious mean?

353
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:12,310
Scott: big mouth?

354
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,683
Rym: Living or experiencing through someone else without actually experiencing.

355
00:24:16,743 --> 00:24:17,627
Scott: That is correct.

356
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:22,500
Scott: Yes haha Okay, let us continue right.

357
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:30,367
Rym: so as we last left our heroes We collapsed at like 3 30 in the morning after that last concert destroyed us.

358
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:34,579
Rym: All right Yes, basically we were defeated.

359
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,181
Rym: we failed.

360
00:24:35,221 --> 00:24:37,770
Rym: we had to leave before the concert ended.

361
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:41,170
Scott: So we woke up and we had to get out the hotel.

362
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:44,386
Scott: So we we checked the bags and that the you know little.

363
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:46,295
Scott: no we didn't this thing Didn't we do that?

364
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:49,550
Rym: as you recall packs is a con where you stay Sunday?

365
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,367
Rym: Alright, I believe you're forgetting that we actually stayed in Seattle for a whole extra day.

366
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:57,339
Scott: This is the thing It's been so long since the past Scott.

367
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,970
Scott: I don't have this problem that I forgot sort of what happened.

368
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,029
Scott: It's all one big blur.

369
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:07,919
Rym: I don't know but I don't have this problem and you seem to have this problem after every convention Because you have a document in front of you with notes and I don't.

370
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,836
Rym: my document doesn't say oh don't forget We didn't check out of the hotel on Sunday.

371
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:16,990
Scott: Oh the fact that it doesn't say we checked out of the hotel is enough anyway.

372
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:23,267
Rym: No, because I remembered that we stayed we did a show about the fact that we stayed in Seattle.

373
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:27,324
Scott: Yeah All right, I think you had some problems.

374
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:28,010
Rym: anyway.

375
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,229
Scott: Pax doesn't have any problems though.

376
00:25:30,451 --> 00:25:31,318
Rym: The thing about packs.

377
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:45,322
Rym: other that like anime cons, you know a lot of the cons we go to like Friday and Saturday the big days and Sunday is mostly wrecked because everyone checks out of their hotel room so they don't actually go to the con until like one and then the con ends at like three and then everyone goes home all depressed.

378
00:25:45,364 --> 00:25:49,489
Rym: but Pack starts a little late on Sunday and goes until six.

379
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:52,669
Scott: Yeah, I mean it starts at what ten o'clock, right?

380
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,629
Scott: It starts at ten o'clock every day except for Friday when it starts at two.

381
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,710
Scott: Basically, you got a you get a good chance for breakfast but going till six that's pretty damn good.

382
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,150
Scott: That's like a whole day there.

383
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,934
Rym: What packs does?

384
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:08,130
Rym: is they basically shift the con forward in time?

385
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:14,110
Rym: Anime cons start Friday morning and end Sunday morning pack starts Friday afternoon and end Sunday evening.

386
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,818
Rym: Mm-hmm, but you know we get our stuff together.

387
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:27,823
Rym: now the previous day because we'd seen the dune game Just sitting there and no one was playing it and every now and then people would look at it I remember a few people would walk up like oh my god.

388
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:28,747
Rym: It's the dune game.

389
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:29,430
Scott: I know this is remember.

390
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,817
Scott: This is an ultra rare game.

391
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:32,263
Scott: We've talked about it on the show before.

392
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,784
Scott: I picked up a pretty good Copy on eBay for an incredible price.

393
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:36,630
Scott: cuz that's bad luck.

394
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,950
Scott: We got real luck, but we saw a copy there with a sign on it.

395
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,409
Scott: I said don't take it out of this room.

396
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:47,889
Scott: That's something special when you see another one and you're like oh, man now at some point That's gonna be busted out.

397
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,622
Rym: So I really wanted to play it and I figured Sunday would be the day.

398
00:26:50,682 --> 00:26:55,949
Rym: so the previous day on Saturday I was like I was standing in front of it kind of staring at it.

399
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,281
Rym: They're looking around the room talking to people like you know what that game is.

400
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:01,509
Rym: do you understand what that game is yeah?

401
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:12,908
Scott: I mean it's like in that episode of the Simpsons where there's all the people are fighting on the Simpsons front There's the guy in the white suit Doesn't do anything and then as soon as Homer closed the door and it isn't looking the white guy bus out.

402
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:21,470
Scott: well the guy In the white suit Anyway, so this is one of those things you the dune game sitting there at the beginning of this convention.

403
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:23,357
Scott: You know the convention is three days.

404
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:27,091
Scott: at some point that box is gonna open and crazy shits gonna Go.

405
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:35,944
Rym: it probably would have been worth it to give him your driver's license to get the game and then report your driver's license gone Because replacement driver's license is cheaper than that board game.

406
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:40,889
Scott: Oh wow it's true Yeah, but anyway the drive home and you get pulled over.

407
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:47,929
Rym: So um basically I was standing in front of the game And I make an offhand comment about how amazing the game is.

408
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:54,064
Rym: now I wish I could forget get people to play it with me But I'm busy and a pegs enforcer says leave a note.

409
00:27:54,445 --> 00:27:55,368
Rym: We'll take care of it.

410
00:27:56,475 --> 00:28:02,006
Rym: So I leave a note saying hey sign up to play dune on Sunday.

411
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:09,681
Rym: I'll check Saturday night to see when the game will be blah blah blah, and I leave it there And I totally didn't check on it.

412
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:11,450
Rym: not at all not at all.

413
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:13,750
Scott: We didn't have time and we totally forgot about it.

414
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,450
Rym: Well the reason we didn't have time was because of the epicness that followed our panel on Saturday.

415
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:21,665
Scott: Yeah, but anyway when we got the piece of paper back on Sunday.

416
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:22,630
Rym: It was flipped over.

417
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:28,290
Scott: There were no names on the front, but it said note on other side, please read yep.

418
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:33,664
Rym: So I flip it over and someone wrote basically oh my god the dune game is awesome.

419
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:35,550
Rym: Call me and we'll play it.

420
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:38,119
Scott: Yeah, they said call me and we'll play it Saturday night.

421
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,405
Scott: I'm like Saturday night.

422
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:40,770
Scott: Were you not going any concerts?

423
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,432
Scott: What's your problem?

424
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:41,893
Rym: Well?

425
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:49,629
Rym: No they actually said Sunday night, so my guess is either that they didn't plan well Or they were the person who brought the game.

426
00:28:50,273 --> 00:28:51,440
Rym: Yeah, I have no idea.

427
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,877
Rym: I do know one thing though the phone number They left which I have not yet called.

428
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:56,563
Rym: so if you're listening dude.

429
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,370
Rym: I haven't called you yet, but I have your phone number.

430
00:28:59,014 --> 00:29:00,322
Rym: I realized in retrospect.

431
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:01,469
Rym: It's a New York area code.

432
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,978
Scott: Yeah, so maybe we should call.

433
00:29:03,998 --> 00:29:13,250
Rym: so I got to call this number at some point and be like hey I'm a guy Who has your phone number because you wrote it on a piece of paper of dubious nature at PAX.

434
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:17,649
Scott: It's some guy from New York who moved to Seattle and is living there.

435
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:20,079
Rym: Maybe I'll bet it's someone who flew out.

436
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,903
Rym: who knows why?

437
00:29:20,943 --> 00:29:22,610
Rym: she's some Moz guy, right?

438
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:27,708
Rym: So uh yeah, we didn't get to play dune, but that's fine because dune takes a lot.

439
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:28,231
Rym: well Do.

440
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:31,110
Rym: it either takes five minutes to play or like four hours.

441
00:29:31,174 --> 00:29:37,010
Scott: Yeah Cuz everyone can bring out their full forces to bear right away, and then the rest of the game is a struggle.

442
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:41,127
Rym: So what do you do on a Sunday morning at PAX you play via play D again?

443
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:44,256
Rym: That's right Like four or five more times.

444
00:29:44,357 --> 00:29:48,530
Scott: we're gonna be talking about via play D in the future, but right now is great.

445
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,017
Scott: You just have to know the via play D is great Especially at a convention.

446
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,624
Scott: play it whenever you can

447
00:29:53,644 --> 00:29:54,889
Rym: yes, but on Sunday part

448
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:55,070
Scott: of it

449
00:29:55,391 --> 00:30:04,619
Rym: We gathered multiple crowd standing around watching this game And we played it and played it and played it and then we handed it off to another group of people who kept the game Going as we left

450
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:05,670
Scott: all right.

451
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:11,529
Rym: So then we realized one thing we hadn't done to the entire con was harass watsi.

452
00:30:12,631 --> 00:30:14,259
Rym: We'd planned on harassing watsi.

453
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,812
Scott: We just never really didn't plan on it But I did.

454
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:24,025
Scott: I sort of realized that you know the whole bottom floor of you know this Gaming annex was all is like the watsi room.

455
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:25,070
Scott: They had World of Warcraft.

456
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,078
Scott: You know on that World of Warcraft card game.

457
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,038
Rym: well that World of Warcraft the board game, but we'll get to that Yeah, but that's a different company.

458
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:31,643
Rym: No.

459
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:34,305
Rym: No I'm referring to Something we're gonna talk about.

460
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:38,189
Rym: oh Yeah But ever what I did there?

461
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:39,815
Scott: I made another fun.

462
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:40,256
Rym: easily

463
00:30:40,276 --> 00:30:54,758
Scott: they had magic the gathering and every other watsi game in the universe was was being played and demoed And all that business, so I thought you know Saturday I was like you because we needed something to do on Sunday right to do before The closing business, and I said you know

464
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:54,959
Rym: what.

465
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,990
Scott: why don't we go down and play like a fourth ed demo?

466
00:30:58,472 --> 00:31:00,890
Scott: And not because I was enthusiastic about fourth edition.

467
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:12,662
Scott: I'm obviously not if you if you've listened to the show before ever right, but because I like to be the person who you know tells people hey don't knock it if you didn't try it and thus I like to knock they.

468
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:13,489
Scott: I'd like to try.

469
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,263
Rym: Yeah, is that a Freudian slip?

470
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:24,050
Scott: I like to knock things too But I also like to try things for the express purpose of then being able to knock them without being people.

471
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:37,557
Rym: You know having people talk back to me now I point out that this was not entirely altruistic and not entirely for this reason because The conversation Scott and I had as we were walking up to see if we could get in was Alright, whatever game.

472
00:31:37,597 --> 00:31:38,139
Rym: We join.

473
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:45,830
Rym: Let's pull out the burning wheel bullshit I'm gonna be questioning my motives, and let's totally fight among each other and not get anything account.

474
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,186
Scott: Yeah, I expected you know do a role-playing demo even a short one right I expect.

475
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:53,682
Scott: you know even though I didn't expect there to be rules for role-playing.

476
00:31:53,823 --> 00:31:55,873
Scott: I was gonna role-play it up I was gonna be.

477
00:31:56,235 --> 00:31:57,359
Scott: you know I was gonna.

478
00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:12,610
Scott: basically we're gonna walk in in character and Ask what our motivation was frustrate the dungeon master and fight for what we believed Exactly and see how the system handled it But also try to learn the rules and see if our suspicions of fourth edition were correct.

479
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:19,690
Rym: Yes, because while I you know a lot of people have said it's just wow it's just wow but I was a little dubious.

480
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,814
Rym: I think you know we got to see.

481
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:37,705
Rym: but and also the other reason and the reason I was going into this with the Adversarial point of view was that the panel before our panel on Saturday was the watsy panel how to be a good dungeon master basically and I really wanted those people to come to because basically it was the oh my god.

482
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:40,808
Rym: watsy panel followed by the Dungeons & Dragons as poop panel.

483
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:47,728
Rym: So I really wanted them to realize what was going on and see our panel and get angry.

484
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:49,698
Rym: however I didn't really.

485
00:32:49,718 --> 00:33:01,730
Rym: I didn't think until after our panel started that Even if they'd wanted to even if all those watsy people with their special badges wanted to see our panel They couldn't have because they were doing the panel before they couldn't get in line.

486
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:06,995
Scott: And there's no special preference for anyone at PAX unless you have an all-access bed Which they did not have.

487
00:33:07,036 --> 00:33:12,216
Rym: no they had that like four people Gabe Tycho They're their girlfriend.

488
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:14,081
Scott: I guess their wives and their kids.

489
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:16,770
Scott: Maybe yeah, maybe Robert coup and such.

490
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,970
Rym: I assume Robert coup had the purple bag.

491
00:33:20,017 --> 00:33:24,718
Scott: Not many people because the computer trust them I mean MC front lot had the same badge.

492
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,370
Scott: we had the light blue special guest slash panelist badge.

493
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,082
Rym: I like saying that.

494
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:31,030
Rym: I like pointing that out.

495
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,076
Rym: It's just a little ego thing.

496
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:32,940
Rym: cuz I go to.

497
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:34,388
Rym: you know anime cons, and we kill it.

498
00:33:34,408 --> 00:33:35,171
Rym: well I would account.

499
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:36,716
Rym: we collected those ribbons like.

500
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:37,579
Rym: I got dealer.

501
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,602
Rym: I got press.

502
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:39,605
Rym: I got artist Ali.

503
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:40,467
Rym: I got panelist.

504
00:33:40,908 --> 00:33:45,223
Scott: yeah Anyway, so we go into play to this watsy room.

505
00:33:45,263 --> 00:33:48,094
Scott: right and I'm like cuz we you know I'm like hey Rym Let's do the D&D demo.

506
00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:48,918
Scott: why not right?

507
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:52,070
Scott: so we go in and there's a. this is our PGA people.

508
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:57,830
Scott: I don't know what the RPG a exactly is but basically it looks like they're a group of DMS who run watsy demos.

509
00:33:58,012 --> 00:33:59,222
Scott: That's what I can tell.

510
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:09,210
Rym: Wow Scott, okay I'm not gonna get into that but basically what they had going on was they had a living forgotten at Adams Which was more traditional D&D, but still in fourth head.

511
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,436
Rym: But they were scheduled long events.

512
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:12,078
Rym: that had been.

513
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,748
Rym: the slots have been filled up long before we had a chance to get in.

514
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,650
Rym: yeah And also we didn't have time because we had plans for Sunday.

515
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,120
Scott: So this lady is saying hey who wants to?

516
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,770
Scott: bloody but right and and she's like I need two people.

517
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,658
Scott: So I'm like us and she's like okay.

518
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:28,168
Scott: You're on and we wrote down our names, and then we're like.

519
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:28,630
Rym: What is this?

520
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,239
Rym: She's like it's a dungeon delve blah blah blah.

521
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,563
Rym: We'll provide characters.

522
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:37,627
Scott: be back in an hour Okay, so oh, but she said we needed dice.

523
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,803
Rym: now This is the funny part because she's and as soon as she says we need dice.

524
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:48,022
Rym: Scott's like we don't have dice and I'm like Will you can we get dice?

525
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:49,129
Rym: and she was like well?

526
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,596
Rym: Well you can you can go buy some.

527
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:55,025
Scott: there's a guy upstairs selling emergency gaming supply.

528
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:56,330
Rym: We both immediately balk.

529
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,697
Rym: We're like oh, I don't know about this I don't know if this is worth it.

530
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,109
Rym: and she was visibly distressed by this.

531
00:35:03,189 --> 00:35:09,270
Rym: like She was really not happy with the fact that we suddenly were not excited and we're thinking of bailing yep.

532
00:35:09,873 --> 00:35:17,610
Rym: So she's like oh well we could probably scrape something Please come back, and then she like went off to do something, but I mean normally like I'm not exaggerating.

533
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,985
Rym: She really seemed distressed about the fact that we lost interest the moment.

534
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:21,990
Rym: We were told we had to buy dice.

535
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:25,196
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I would have brought dice with me It would have been all cool, but I'm not.

536
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:28,050
Scott: you know I'm looking for a demo so I can learn something.

537
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,558
Scott: I'm not gonna pay to try something out.

538
00:35:30,598 --> 00:35:32,063
Scott: You know for you to sell something to me.

539
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:32,464
Rym: Well.

540
00:35:32,524 --> 00:35:33,166
Rym: It would depend.

541
00:35:33,447 --> 00:35:40,978
Rym: Yeah, I mean Basically, I was not excited about fourth edition already And I kind of knew what to expect.

542
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,746
Rym: yeah, so it's not like.

543
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:46,449
Rym: I mean it's like hey You want to try this piece of poop?

544
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,374
Rym: I'm not gonna try that.

545
00:35:48,474 --> 00:35:49,660
Rym: I know I know what to expect.

546
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:51,450
Rym: you're gonna have to pay me to try the piece of poop.

547
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:53,681
Scott: Well actually you know.

548
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:55,530
Scott: if you want to try the piece of poop all right.

549
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:59,252
Scott: Just just you're gonna have to buy this stick to pick it up with Scott.

550
00:35:59,673 --> 00:36:06,779
Rym: take poop use poo on crazy guy exactly which I point out is probably the second most inside joke I've ever made on the show.

551
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:14,493
Rym: maybe anyway We go upstairs to look at the guys selling dice, and I'm basically like all right if we can't get some cheap dice Let's bail.

552
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:18,346
Scott: well actually I was sort of looking at like a lot of the fancy d6 dices.

553
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:21,237
Scott: cuz I'm just like oh Man, but we don't need I don't.

554
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:21,618
Scott: I don't need.

555
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:22,783
Scott: I have more d6 is that?

556
00:36:22,823 --> 00:36:24,430
Scott: I know here's the problem.

557
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,698
Rym: D6 is would not have helped us as D&D.

558
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,120
Rym: we need all the.

559
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:29,049
Scott: I know that, but I was still ogling the disease.

560
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:35,332
Rym: I don't think you all out there understand how many non d6 dice I have.

561
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:37,560
Rym: I have like nine d20s.

562
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:38,543
Rym: I have full.

563
00:36:38,925 --> 00:36:39,788
Scott: I have like six d20s.

564
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:46,778
Rym: I have like full sets of loadouts to roll combat for various characters I have played over the years.

565
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:47,804
Scott: Wow like.

566
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,954
Rym: I also have that awesome Die that I. that's right.

567
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,047
Scott: you would always get a character who would like this character does 2d12 damage.

568
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,950
Scott: She would buy a d20 and 2d12s that were the same color.

569
00:36:56,993 --> 00:36:58,214
Scott: Yes Go with the character.

570
00:36:58,354 --> 00:37:04,990
Rym: partly because I was so frustrated with how long combat took that I sped my own turn up as much as possible so I could resume playing advanced wars in the corner.

571
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:09,490
Rym: Yeah, I would like roll my cop by roll like I'd finish my round.

572
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:12,043
Rym: I'd roll my attacks for the next round and then just leave.

573
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,550
Rym: yeah anyway.

574
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:18,787
Scott: So the guy we look around and we actually see a set of D&D dice.

575
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:19,168
Scott: You know a d20?

576
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:26,066
Rym: Well first I resigned myself because I see like all right for six bucks We can get some stand like a set of standard dice.

577
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:26,649
Rym: we can use them.

578
00:37:27,152 --> 00:37:29,383
Rym: And then I look and I notice there's one set of dice.

579
00:37:29,423 --> 00:37:30,750
Rym: That's real playing.

580
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,099
Rym: It's like the grayest and sheep is.

581
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,367
Scott: it's basically a set of dice for D&D.

582
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,990
Scott: But they're ugly just flat gray boring plastic.

583
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:43,564
Rym: They were the most unadorned dice I've ever seen.

584
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:44,610
Scott: there are two dollars.

585
00:37:45,072 --> 00:37:45,615
Rym: It was literally.

586
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:46,399
Rym: it was two dollars.

587
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,464
Rym: and not only that.

588
00:37:47,544 --> 00:37:50,429
Rym: I was like alright I'm buying these two dollar dice.

589
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:57,907
Rym: They gave me a free dice bag a pretty high-quality Dice bag for free a dice bag that was worth more than two dollars, and I need a dice bag for my d6s.

590
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:00,115
Scott: Not that one, but I'm gonna.

591
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,018
Scott: I definitely got to go.

592
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,230
Scott: remember that I need some dice bag action, so we're like all right.

593
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:05,777
Rym: Well, let's do this.

594
00:38:05,837 --> 00:38:06,782
Rym: Let's see what happens.

595
00:38:06,822 --> 00:38:08,370
Rym: so then of course we got an hour to kill.

596
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:11,370
Rym: We don't really want to leave so we go outside looking for something to drink.

597
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:16,170
Rym: I just want to give this as an aside, so we find this land party place like down the street.

598
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:21,534
Rym: So and it's like land party and nachos, so we're like all right Let's get.

599
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:27,244
Rym: land party was internet cafe, and yeah But it was like a gamer II kind of place we go in and those are.

600
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:30,418
Rym: that was the worst smelling salsa I've ever smelled like a place.

601
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:32,286
Scott: the place smelled bad, so we left.

602
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:33,070
Rym: it smelled bad.

603
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:33,993
Rym: We were like all right.

604
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:34,756
Rym: Let's get out of here.

605
00:38:35,098 --> 00:38:46,298
Rym: so next door to the Seattle equivalent of a bodega and there is a line of like 20 packs people all buying things and All I got to say Seattle is a strange and weird place.

606
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:51,409
Rym: not only did they have Faygo red pop and Faygo rock and rye But I bought both of which.

607
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:54,429
Rym: They also had the white chocolate kitkats.

608
00:38:54,911 --> 00:39:00,230
Scott: They had pretty much every candy in every beverage in this one bodega stuff that I can't get in New York.

609
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,043
Scott: It's like why was I buying beverages anywhere else the whole weekend.

610
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:04,589
Scott: I should have been buying them all there.

611
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:06,585
Scott: I got a gigantic apple juice.

612
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:07,109
Scott: It was great.

613
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:13,272
Rym: So you know we hang around we screw around then we walk back in and we walk up to the table where all the characters are.

614
00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:18,855
Rym: so we start looking at character sheets for D&D fourth ed and Warning bells start going off.

615
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:26,841
Rym: these character sheets don't look like character sheets from previous D&D's like I'd seen the characters even for today But I hadn't really really examined it.

616
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,235
Rym: It looks like a wow Character screen.

617
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:31,561
Scott: yeah, it was it.

618
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:33,830
Scott: pretty much everything on there has to do with combat.

619
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,843
Scott: Nothing on there has to do with anything else, but combat.

620
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:38,310
Scott: I mean there's one at the top.

621
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:43,291
Scott: There's like a quote and I was like is that quote all I have to go on Really?

622
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:45,984
Rym: and the quote didn't even have anything to do with your character.

623
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:50,059
Scott: no, so Basically eventually what happens is that you know our game.

624
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:54,638
Scott: people the people were in the game with us start getting together And one of the people was the DMS wife.

625
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:54,980
Rym: now.

626
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,602
Rym: She walks over.

627
00:39:55,622 --> 00:39:55,904
Rym: She's like.

628
00:39:55,984 --> 00:39:56,566
Rym: Oh you're on team.

629
00:39:56,606 --> 00:39:57,149
Rym: Whatever like?

630
00:39:57,169 --> 00:39:57,912
Rym: yeah Oh, she's like.

631
00:39:57,953 --> 00:39:58,837
Rym: Oh, we'll be playing together.

632
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:03,653
Scott: you pick characters yet, and I'm like now blah blah blah Yeah, I didn't even realize I had to pick a character You know.

633
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,810
Rym: and so we're looking at and she's like oh you got to pick characters.

634
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:11,410
Rym: And then she starts talking about the strategy and how we're gonna need a cleric and we're gonna need a plan and blah blah blah.

635
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,740
Rym: We probably want this and that.

636
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:24,709
Rym: and then I'm like yeah, well I want to play someone you know role-playing blah blah blah, and she says and she looks at me kind of strangely She's like oh there isn't gonna be any role-playing They're not even pretending anymore.

637
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,060
Rym: So we balk.

638
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:31,938
Rym: we're both like really oh Maybe we should go now again.

639
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,324
Rym: There's a different person.

640
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:37,359
Rym: she seemed Super hurt that we were thinking of bailing.

641
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:40,510
Rym: I think partly because her husband was the dungeon master running the event.

642
00:40:40,951 --> 00:40:46,327
Rym: Yeah, but like it really visibly upset her that we balked immediately when she said there's no role-playing.

643
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:49,276
Rym: She was like no No, it'll still be fun come on.

644
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:51,242
Rym: Don't don't leave us keep forget a play.

645
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:52,245
Scott: come on.

646
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:54,090
Scott: well because if we bailed out.

647
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:54,865
Scott: What were they gonna do?

648
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,161
Scott: They were gonna fail pretty much, so we're like all right.

649
00:40:59,201 --> 00:40:59,783
Rym: We'll try this.

650
00:40:59,843 --> 00:41:05,448
Rym: we sit down and I Will sum this up because I don't want to turn this into the talk about D&D.

651
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:07,457
Scott: fourth day We'll need another show to talk about D&D.

652
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,170
Rym: basically we sit down, and they're like all right.

653
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:15,414
Rym: This is a delve and basically delve is Basically it means raid.

654
00:41:15,915 --> 00:41:17,960
Scott: Yeah, all we did was okay.

655
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:21,490
Scott: You guys open the door monsters fight the monsters, okay?

656
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,897
Scott: You beat all the monsters guess what?

657
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,621
Scott: now you're over here.

658
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,110
Scott: open the door monsters.

659
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:27,314
Rym: He's like and there's a timer.

660
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:44,050
Rym: It's like how far can you get in 30 minutes ready, and we're like ready, and he says Go it start on a stopwatch, and then he says the following You open the dank and musty door to the dungeon insider cobwebs and the arcane horrors of ancient blah blah blah blah blah.

661
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,039
Rym: You smell a dark blah blah blah blah blah.

662
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,566
Rym: before you were four skeletons.

663
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:52,141
Rym: They're glowing blue Yeah, and then he's like roll for initiative.

664
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:54,490
Scott: talk about classic roll for initiative.

665
00:41:54,610 --> 00:42:00,281
Scott: I can't even try to talk to the skeletons or run away Or and you know what the thing is.

666
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,290
Scott: it basically comes down to a miniatures game.

667
00:42:02,651 --> 00:42:04,196
Scott: You know with using.

668
00:42:04,216 --> 00:42:08,629
Scott: you know doing the most average damage, and you possibly can given your ability.

669
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,623
Rym: I was a paladin.

670
00:42:10,643 --> 00:42:15,313
Rym: I had to draw agro and Tank.

671
00:42:15,754 --> 00:42:19,750
Rym: yeah in fact those terms draw agro and tank.

672
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:25,488
Rym: We're used by the other people playing who obviously have had more experience with fourth ed than us.

673
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:29,614
Rym: again I drew Agro and tanked.

674
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:32,503
Rym: it is just World of Warcraft with pen and paper.

675
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:34,147
Rym: It was awful.

676
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:39,289
Scott: you know Even considering that right that it's World of Warcraft on paper.

677
00:42:40,173 --> 00:42:42,764
Scott: Why play this when you could play World of Warcraft?

678
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:45,255
Scott: you won't have to roll dice And you won't have to

679
00:42:45,295 --> 00:43:04,966
Rym: do bad thing is you know in many ways they simplified the game but at the same time they actually kind of made it more complex and Despite having this like professional watsy dungeon master dude running the game for us He had to look up stuff a lot and like the rules were really really really fiddly And he had a lot of trouble keeping track of all the numbers.

680
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:17,390
Scott: yeah And like basically every you could see how they change the game to where you know an old D&D if you're a cleric Right you healed, and if you aren't healing you're doing weak ass damage, and you weren't being helpful.

681
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:18,996
Scott: They basically everything.

682
00:43:19,156 --> 00:43:20,682
Scott: everyone was helpful all the time.

683
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:27,904
Scott: every cleric spell that I had Did damage and also as a side effect boosted someone in some way.

684
00:43:28,164 --> 00:43:30,070
Rym: everything you do does damage?

685
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,916
Scott: It's just everything I could do.

686
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:36,506
Scott: did damage what I mean it even third ed right.

687
00:43:36,586 --> 00:43:48,308
Scott: they started to decrease it somewhat but they always had the fun spells that you know like you know instant fortress or Well some of the other big bees crushing fish.

688
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:49,474
Rym: now They're they're made.

689
00:43:49,535 --> 00:43:52,430
Rym: I mean there is stuff like that in fourth edition.

690
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:59,821
Rym: But the game really is not conducive to anything but playing World of Warcraft raids or World of Warcraft combat like.

691
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:02,007
Rym: there's nothing else to D&D anymore.

692
00:44:02,047 --> 00:44:06,210
Rym: fourth edition is Just a really weak version of World of Warcraft.

693
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,338
Scott: Yeah It's like I could have role-played.

694
00:44:08,518 --> 00:44:14,045
Rym: you are better off playing the World of Warcraft Card game raid than you are playing D&D fourth ed.

695
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,010
Rym: like I'm serious.

696
00:44:15,131 --> 00:44:15,860
Scott: I mean you could have.

697
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:24,028
Scott: we could have role-played But the role-playing was not in any way helped or hindered by the dice or the numbers on the paper or anything.

698
00:44:24,048 --> 00:44:30,809
Scott: so Any role-playing we could have done we could have done equally well without fourth ed just with no paper.

699
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:34,629
Scott: No pens No books no dice, so what would be the point?

700
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:38,542
Scott: Why have D&D if it doesn't help or hinder the role-playing.

701
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:40,450
Scott: so I asked completely separate.

702
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:45,010
Rym: I ask all of you out there because I don't I mean we'll talk about fourth ed at some point in the future.

703
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:48,630
Rym: I will by various means acquire the book so that I can do a full review.

704
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:54,730
Rym: Can anyone out there defend Dungeons & Dragons fourth edition as a collaborative?

705
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,568
Rym: storytelling game with conflict resolution mechanics.

706
00:44:57,891 --> 00:45:00,869
Scott: I could defend it as a fantasy miniatures game.

707
00:45:01,271 --> 00:45:09,257
Scott: Possibly I could defend it as better than hero quest even though it's the same kind of game But it's basically just hero quest advanced.

708
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:11,403
Scott: it's not anything else than that anymore.

709
00:45:11,564 --> 00:45:18,626
Rym: It was I'm sorry, but it was Awful really bad, and it was kind of fun because we're trying to figure out at least.

710
00:45:18,686 --> 00:45:19,268
Scott: it only took 30 minutes.

711
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,230
Rym: Yeah, actually we had to play a shortened delve because they're running out of time.

712
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:27,590
Rym: It's only 20 minutes, and then at the end they gave us like because we lost.

713
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,495
Rym: But we got whatever.

714
00:45:28,877 --> 00:45:31,430
Rym: they give us these wooden coins with like the D&D logo on them.

715
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,714
Rym: We could exchange them for prizes.

716
00:45:33,216 --> 00:45:37,030
Rym: so we gave all of them to some guy, but I stole one and then that was it.

717
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,520
Rym: We left.

718
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:46,937
Scott: yeah I mean to give them the benefit of the doubt right if we had done say living forgotten realms instead of dungeon delve There might have role play.

719
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:49,147
Scott: there might have been role-playing involved.

720
00:45:49,188 --> 00:46:00,063
Scott: however That role-playing was obviously in no way related to the anything in the books You know in in in the game, so it would have just.

721
00:46:00,284 --> 00:46:02,250
Scott: we didn't even need D&D to do that role-playing.

722
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:06,083
Scott: We could have just sat down with some forgotten realms novels and done that role-playing.

723
00:46:06,505 --> 00:46:15,641
Rym: the other thing was that they said you know no Experience necessary just play and I didn't really know the rules to forthhead, but I want to say this Experience was 100% necessary.

724
00:46:15,902 --> 00:46:17,470
Rym: there was no help provided at all.

725
00:46:17,551 --> 00:46:18,785
Rym: I had no idea like our.

726
00:46:18,805 --> 00:46:18,947
Rym: well

727
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:35,334
Scott: I only reason I was able to get by is because some of my basic knowledge of D of you know third ed and up Previous D&D still functioned yeah, but Lola d20 to see if you hit and some of it was actually I'll give it credit some of it was intuitive to any someone who already knew Third ed

728
00:46:35,414 --> 00:46:44,850
Rym: yes, but at the same time the the way it flowed in general was Largely incomprehensible and unless you would already read the rules and knew something yeah.

729
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:47,302
Scott: But I sort of figured out the basics of.

730
00:46:47,564 --> 00:46:54,190
Scott: you know you attack It's versus the other guys defense depending on what your attack is you know roll your damages.

731
00:46:55,032 --> 00:47:01,869
Rym: Yeah, I'm not entirely sure how actions work because I always seem to have Fucking clue, I just kept doing things until they told me to stop.

732
00:47:02,634 --> 00:47:11,739
Scott: And the other thing is that a lot of times like my side effects for all the cleric spells I'd be like hey someone gets a plus two bonus Hey, hey, and no one would pay attention and no one would get the bonus of like.

733
00:47:11,759 --> 00:47:15,081
Rym: okay, whatever Yeah, but whatever enough D&D.

734
00:47:15,142 --> 00:47:16,730
Rym: we left that business never to return.

735
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,222
Rym: But then we went to the expo room again again.

736
00:47:20,242 --> 00:47:27,308
Rym: our plan was it's Sunday Maybe we can go do something that there was a line for the previous day.

737
00:47:27,328 --> 00:47:33,525
Rym: the answer The line for the fallout booth was even longer left for dead.

738
00:47:33,746 --> 00:47:35,150
Rym: forget it like left for dead.

739
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,295
Rym: I couldn't even get near it.

740
00:47:36,617 --> 00:47:37,581
Scott: well actually I got.

741
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:42,505
Scott: I watched some people play it on a screen And that's all I needed to see to know that I'm buying it.

742
00:47:42,546 --> 00:47:43,370
Scott: no questions asked.

743
00:47:43,671 --> 00:47:50,802
Rym: I did watch a bunch of people on a stage playing the Rhythm music whatever game we play or whatever.

744
00:47:50,823 --> 00:47:52,209
Rym: It's called for the DA or the.

745
00:47:52,229 --> 00:47:55,484
Rym: we We like dance and do new instruments and stuff.

746
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:56,288
Scott: was it was it.

747
00:47:56,348 --> 00:47:56,770
Scott: well there were two.

748
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,350
Scott: There was we music which was going down at the Nintendo booth.

749
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:12,914
Rym: Yeah, that was also the raving rabbits, which had a stage I saw that - they're playing a multiplayer mode now the raving rabbits one looked a little bit better but I gotta say both games reeked of Dancing around with.

750
00:48:12,934 --> 00:48:18,030
Rym: the wiimote is already obsolete and these games are going to be sold to people who don't actually like games.

751
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:19,695
Rym: They did not look fun.

752
00:48:20,096 --> 00:48:22,123
Rym: It looked like you could just waggle and always win.

753
00:48:22,584 --> 00:48:28,194
Scott: Yeah, it was definitely not Not something I'm gonna shell out for big time I would.

754
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:29,883
Rym: I don't think I would even pay for like it.

755
00:48:29,903 --> 00:48:31,190
Rym: just they really didn't look fun.

756
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:31,772
Rym: And you know what.

757
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:34,264
Rym: there was really no one in line to play either one.

758
00:48:34,284 --> 00:48:37,490
Scott: Yeah It said yeah, it's kind of weird.

759
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:45,270
Scott: It's like you could actually go to the Nintendo booth where they had Unreleased games to play and the lines were not that long not as long as they were it.

760
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:48,550
Scott: You know the big games, but I guess you know as the demographic of the packs.

761
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:50,660
Rym: Yeah, I mean look Nintendo really also.

762
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,670
Scott: Nintendo's booth is really subdued.

763
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:53,636
Scott: I expect.

764
00:48:53,656 --> 00:48:55,830
Scott: you know they should have had a big booth like those other guys.

765
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,944
Rym: Well, what would Nintendo have had to offer to the average person?

766
00:48:59,084 --> 00:49:03,069
Rym: a lot more screens a lot I mean in terms of upcoming games.

767
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:06,910
Rym: What does Nintendo have to offer to the average packs is handy.

768
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:11,950
Scott: Maybe they should have busted something out new at packs that would have you know attracted people.

769
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:13,329
Rym: They just they didn't have anything.

770
00:49:13,774 --> 00:49:32,203
Rym: I don't I hate to say like core gamers or hardcore gamers because that that is such a loaded BS term that people use to further their own agendas, but Nintendo more like less and less has anything to offer to me except on the DS like the Wii Has Megaman 9 which is currently the best game on the way.

771
00:49:32,223 --> 00:49:34,290
Scott: Wario is coming in the mail could be here tomorrow.

772
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,275
Rym: Yeah, but what else?

773
00:49:35,617 --> 00:49:36,441
Rym: what else?

774
00:49:36,823 --> 00:49:38,170
Scott: not for him up for now nothing?

775
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,685
Rym: Yeah, so we pretty much wandered around and gave up on that.

776
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:51,387
Rym: anyway We dicked around we wandered around the con a whole bunch and basically we didn't try to go to any panels because the lines for Every Sunday panel were again Ludicrous like there was no way to get in.

777
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:59,170
Scott: yeah We spent some time laying in the DS area always good And you know DS area B not A or C A or C suck.

778
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:04,105
Rym: Yes over the course of the con we realized that DS lounge B is the GeekNights lounge.

779
00:50:04,145 --> 00:50:12,469
Rym: like I hereby Officially endorse DS lounge B at the penny arcade expo other DS lounges are poop.

780
00:50:13,172 --> 00:50:14,538
Scott: DS lounge B is greatness.

781
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:17,110
Rym: I don't care what what configuration they ever use in the future.

782
00:50:17,572 --> 00:50:21,527
Rym: Whichever one is designated B or the closest thing to B is best.

783
00:50:21,707 --> 00:50:24,690
Scott: That's correct But you know the B stands for best.

784
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:27,182
Rym: We spent some time hanging out with all the cool people.

785
00:50:27,222 --> 00:50:28,830
Scott: he stands for crap and a stands for ass.

786
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:32,629
Rym: We met at the convention all the listeners and everything.

787
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:34,132
Rym: Who do we meet?

788
00:50:34,193 --> 00:50:35,637
Rym: I mean godfather?

789
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,763
Rym: I ran into briefly in line.

790
00:50:37,844 --> 00:50:39,027
Scott: I met him waiting for our panel.

791
00:50:39,188 --> 00:50:39,970
Rym: Yeah, he was pretty cool.

792
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,237
Rym: He's like hey, Roman Scott.

793
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:42,926
Rym: Yeah, I'm the godfather.

794
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:43,509
Rym: Oh cool.

795
00:50:44,772 --> 00:50:52,228
Rym: We met of course hanging out with Aaron who brought us the chocolate and everything Hanging out with our row and her boyfriend and her Asian posse.

796
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:58,049
Scott: Trying to think about we met Mitchie D once at the reg booth and never again ever saw him again.

797
00:50:59,131 --> 00:51:02,864
Rym: Also shoutouts to those two guys who we ran into at both concerts.

798
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,270
Rym: I don't remember either your names.

799
00:51:04,472 --> 00:51:09,566
Scott: There were a lot of people I just don't know who they were that we met but no one was an annoying fan person.

800
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,656
Scott: every single person was cool Which is really weird.

801
00:51:11,797 --> 00:51:17,509
Scott: Yeah, totally usually when people come up to me I'm like I'm expecting at least a slight amount of annoying fan person.

802
00:51:17,972 --> 00:51:19,640
Scott: But now everyone was an awesome person.

803
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:28,629
Scott: like for serious at the average con We go to we should just trade all the East Coast peoples for the West Coast peoples But bring them to the East Coast, which is geographically superior.

804
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:33,745
Rym: I have a feeling that Paxis coast would be the same way, but it bears repeating and I'm not exaggerating.

805
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:40,659
Rym: I did not interact in any way with Anyone that I would classify as a fan boy.

806
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:48,450
Rym: Yeah, no one the scariest person I talked to was like so far above the line.

807
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:52,330
Rym: I guess maybe my line has been lowered by years and years of anime cons and local gaming cons.

808
00:51:52,612 --> 00:51:53,640
Scott: That could be what it is do.

809
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,030
Scott: is our line is just so low?

810
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:59,183
Rym: But no one was even close to the line of packs at all everyone we talked to.

811
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:04,058
Rym: so I'll say this if we talked to You at PAX you were cool.

812
00:52:04,078 --> 00:52:08,010
Rym: It's a say that unilaterally some cooler than others, but all cool.

813
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:14,790
Scott: Yes, some ice cubes some water bottles in the fridge, but no matter No one was in the heater.

814
00:52:15,374 --> 00:52:17,850
Rym: So, you know, there really wasn't much else to say actually about Sunday.

815
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:21,270
Scott: So, uh, well there was when you know, we got in line.

816
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,650
Rym: Well, that's not to say there was nothing else to do.

817
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:27,990
Rym: We didn't really do anything except water around check out stuff water into rooms.

818
00:52:28,332 --> 00:52:31,790
Rym: Some of the stuff we did was actually stuff we talked about as being on Saturday.

819
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:36,010
Rym: We just you know being journalists moved everything around and make it easier to do the show for us.

820
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:40,607
Rym: But then we decided alright, let's get in line for the end.

821
00:52:40,628 --> 00:52:50,735
Rym: because you see Instead of having closing ceremonies what the penny arcade expo has is the omegathon final as the last Ultimate event at PAX.

822
00:52:50,776 --> 00:53:00,830
Rym: basically everyone in the con lines up and then everyone in the con Standing room only goes into main events and watches the end of the omegathon.

823
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,737
Scott: I think there's a genius move by PAX.

824
00:53:02,777 --> 00:53:09,320
Scott: as you look at other conventions like Otakon or right and they have an opening Ceremonies and closing ceremonies and the opening ceremonies.

825
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,750
Scott: all it has to offer is opening ceremonies and the closing ceremonies.

826
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,478
Scott: All it has to offer is closing ceremonies, right?

827
00:53:16,179 --> 00:53:19,990
Scott: It packs the opening ceremonies is an action opening ceremonies.

828
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:23,430
Scott: It's actually a keynote by a famous industry person.

829
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:40,358
Scott: so everyone wants to go and the closing ceremonies is the end of the omegathon where they reveal the secret game and Whoever wins in that unknown secret game, you know gets a huge huge prize Which is actually a trip to the Tokyo game show.

830
00:53:40,438 --> 00:53:44,190
Scott: and you know that that secret game at the end is either gonna be a?

831
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:56,944
Scott: Wicked retro game that no one's ever seen before or some new game like Halo 3 was two years ago that no one's ever played Before now, of course You already know what the last game was because it was basically our thing of the day.

832
00:53:56,964 --> 00:54:05,130
Rym: in the first night of packs coverage We decided alright this we can't risk missing the end of packs or being stuck at the very back of the room.

833
00:54:05,935 --> 00:54:07,104
Rym: let's just get in that line.

834
00:54:07,124 --> 00:54:10,858
Rym: and This line actually warrants being talked about.

835
00:54:10,878 --> 00:54:13,725
Rym: you see they know that everyone's gonna be in this line.

836
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:14,648
Rym: There were.

837
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:21,690
Rym: there was an Inordinate number of packs enforcers managing this line talking to people making sure everything was smooth.

838
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:26,717
Scott: Cuz I mean the rest of packs is winding down pretty much, you know The panels were over and everything.

839
00:54:26,757 --> 00:54:30,750
Scott: so pretty much everything came down to this line and this line only.

840
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:32,723
Rym: So ever everyone is in this line.

841
00:54:32,763 --> 00:54:33,770
Rym: The line was massive.

842
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:37,159
Rym: everyone's just pamped out sitting down totally hanging out.

843
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:51,995
Rym: beach balls and balloons are flying everywhere and then the packs enforcers walk in and They all kind of spread out throughout the crowd and they deliver to fairly random people in groups of people Pipe cleaners

844
00:54:52,578 --> 00:54:55,370
Scott: big bags full of every color of pipe cleaner that you

845
00:54:55,450 --> 00:55:00,082
Rym: Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pipe cleaners of every possible color

846
00:55:00,523 --> 00:55:02,287
Scott: and became arts and crafts time

847
00:55:02,428 --> 00:55:03,330
Rym: now this rain.

848
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:10,654
Rym: No, I gotta say this it ranged from people making like two-dimensional sprite things, you know, like oh my god I made a Mario mushroom.

849
00:55:10,694 --> 00:55:13,905
Rym: That's what we did to people making penises.

850
00:55:13,925 --> 00:55:15,290
Scott: a guy made a penis hat.

851
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:19,594
Rym: Alright, I think this penis hat warrants discussion But wait to discuss.

852
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:30,190
Scott: a guy made a hat out of pipe cleaners and somewhere in the tangle of pipe cleaners That was the hat where some pipe cleaners bent in the shape of a phallus not just in the shape of a phallus.

853
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:38,312
Rym: It was a fully modeled three-dimensional penis complete with balls a glands and ejaculate Uh-huh.

854
00:55:38,654 --> 00:55:41,385
Rym: It hits someone in the eye Rym.

855
00:55:41,465 --> 00:55:42,530
Scott: I know you like those glands.

856
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:48,030
Rym: You know, if you're gonna draw a penis and you don't draw the glands, you're really not drawn a penis great.

857
00:55:49,131 --> 00:55:52,123
Rym: But anyway, like I got there were a lot of penises.

858
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:53,990
Rym: Oh my god were there a lot of penises?

859
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:59,104
Scott: We ended up taking all out like I made some pac-mans and some ghosts and some Mario.

860
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:05,604
Rym: meanwhile Rose sitting next to us Made a very well model three-dimensional Yoshi, which kicked our asses.

861
00:56:05,744 --> 00:56:07,770
Rym: It was it was frighteningly high quality.

862
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:14,729
Scott: Yeah, anyway, we ended up hanging all these things from like the caution tape that separated, you know That made the the line go back and forth.

863
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:22,024
Scott: So as people would everyone who walked by, you know who's behind us in line Which is most people would see it and I suppose they did.

864
00:56:22,526 --> 00:56:23,972
Scott: we have pictures of it online You can guess.

865
00:56:23,992 --> 00:56:35,388
Rym: so basically for all of you who were impacts if you saw a whole bunch of awesome art Hanging from the line about a third of the way from the front That was us and row and her boyfriend and some of the people around us contributing.

866
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:37,194
Rym: Yeah So yeah, that was our.

867
00:56:37,475 --> 00:56:38,880
Rym: that was our mark on packs.

868
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:39,381
Rym: Yep.

869
00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:42,010
Scott: Wait, so we get in there and there's no seats.

870
00:56:42,171 --> 00:56:46,290
Scott: I guess they wanted to make sure everyone got in and people crammed in like it was.

871
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:53,376
Rym: It was as tight as the first concert like it was as tight as a tool concert We went to a long time ago and

872
00:56:53,737 --> 00:57:05,906
Scott: not only is it tight and everyone's crammed in they got some music's going on Right and all the people who had the fallout puppet from the fallout booth grouped up on the right side and we're all dancing.

873
00:57:05,926 --> 00:57:16,897
Rym: and now this is a wonderful and Brilliant example of emergent behavior because basically there were no more than like 20 of these things Maybe 30 of them.

874
00:57:17,098 --> 00:57:19,790
Rym: No, no, maybe 20 all told anyway.

875
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:21,597
Rym: And you there's videos of this online

876
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:22,179
Scott: at

877
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:40,992
Rym: the the final closing ceremonies and at first, you know People would hold them up and you seem held up all over the place, but then Two of them like people worked were two people who had them were standing next to each other over in the right side and Then bit by bit the people who had him started kind of fighting the way through the crowd and all making the way to This point.

878
00:57:41,012 --> 00:57:48,073
Scott: this is like this is a piece of swag that not many people got but it was the highest and most coveted piece Of swag at the convention.

879
00:57:48,114 --> 00:57:56,518
Rym: Yes, seriously the status symbols at this con were in order all access badge Omega not shirts.

880
00:57:57,363 --> 00:58:05,461
Rym: one of those puppets pretty much and I'll tell you this if any of you out there have one and You mail it to me.

881
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:07,885
Rym: I I don't know what I'll do.

882
00:58:08,391 --> 00:58:10,118
Scott: Kotaku was given one away.

883
00:58:10,218 --> 00:58:11,323
Scott: You could have won it but you didn't.

884
00:58:11,725 --> 00:58:14,005
Rym: if anyone sends me one I will make it worth your.

885
00:58:14,065 --> 00:58:16,036
Scott: while I like how Kotaku does that?

886
00:58:16,056 --> 00:58:20,030
Scott: they basically go to the conventions get all the free swag and then give it away on the site.

887
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:29,750
Rym: But like the emergent behavior like bit by bit they all congregated together and then the music's playing and I'm not actually going to say What music like what kind of music?

888
00:58:30,212 --> 00:58:35,550
Rym: They were playing while the crowd was there because the crowd stood in there hanging out for a while before they started the event.

889
00:58:36,292 --> 00:58:40,505
Rym: But the music was great like it really set the mood.

890
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:42,090
Rym: and that's all I really want to say about that.

891
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:51,083
Rym: but you know people start with the puppet start making the puppets dance and waving them back and forth and Kind of like as a group coming up with things to do.

892
00:58:51,184 --> 00:58:52,770
Rym: and you know, it's going okay.

893
00:58:53,572 --> 00:59:00,560
Rym: but then someone did the thing that I would have done if I had the puppet because When one person has the puppet right they stand out in the crowd.

894
00:59:00,801 --> 00:59:06,289
Rym: having that puppet gives you a license to stand out in a gigantic crazy crowd.

895
00:59:06,734 --> 00:59:10,155
Rym: Everyone's looking at you Once you start forming this crowd.

896
00:59:10,195 --> 00:59:12,241
Rym: now you stand out but not you.

897
00:59:12,642 --> 00:59:14,026
Rym: you are now a tiny.

898
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:17,999
Rym: you're one in 20 of The group that is standing on the crowd.

899
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,528
Rym: You don't stand out yourself as much.

900
00:59:20,412 --> 00:59:24,910
Rym: So had I had one of those I would not have joined the congregation of puppets.

901
00:59:25,572 --> 00:59:30,468
Rym: I would have stood on the opposite side of the arena doing contrary things with my puppet.

902
00:59:30,488 --> 00:59:33,982
Rym: by itself It does maintaining myself as standing out in the crowd.

903
00:59:34,223 --> 00:59:36,933
Rym: Mm-hmm and sure enough Someone did that.

904
00:59:37,234 --> 00:59:43,430
Rym: so the puppets are all dancing and then on the other side, there's a puppet flicking them off and masturbating.

905
00:59:45,032 --> 00:59:48,370
Scott: And of course then on the other side all the puppets started making out with each other.

906
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:52,684
Rym: Yes, which caused the puppet on the left to masturbate more furiously.

907
00:59:52,704 --> 00:59:53,868
Scott: That's pretty good.

908
00:59:53,888 --> 00:59:55,896
Rym: You might wonder It's a simple puppet.

909
00:59:55,936 --> 00:59:57,402
Rym: How could it masturbate more furious?

910
00:59:57,422 --> 00:59:59,370
Scott: these puppets, you know surprised that you know.

911
00:59:59,611 --> 01:00:04,005
Scott: I'm pretty sure that the people who had these puppets were not puppeteers by any sir.

912
01:00:04,045 --> 01:00:20,710
Scott: No, John Malkovich There's simple hand puppets, you know, you control the head in two hands very simple, but people were able to manipulate them with such mastery and get such expressiveness out of them and I Attribute it to the design of the puppet being so high quality?

913
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:26,667
Rym: Yes, also just the fact that I have a feeling that the average attendee of packs has fierce masturbatory powers.

914
01:00:26,928 --> 01:00:40,573
Rym: Oh, no doubt but This is going on for a while and like it keeps Escalating like the two sides and no one thinks to Joe like eventually like one other puppet join the lone guy and this puppet thing Went on forever.

915
01:00:40,613 --> 01:00:42,158
Rym: if you search YouTube for the puppets.

916
01:00:42,219 --> 01:00:43,282
Rym: I'm sure you'll find video.

917
01:00:43,323 --> 01:00:44,908
Scott: You'll find too many videos of them.

918
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:51,754
Rym: so I mean other than that the crowd the balloons is still going around and the crowd is like really into it and people are singing along with the music.

919
01:00:51,834 --> 01:01:00,465
Rym: and and then the lights go down and the music in the lights start up and the the fucking epicness of the end of pegs begins.

920
01:01:01,069 --> 01:01:12,410
Rym: now They you know first off I got as we've said the production values like how well put together How slick how professional everything in that room was throughout packs?

921
01:01:13,452 --> 01:01:21,537
Rym: only Escalated at this point and the music starts playing and they introduced the Omega knots and They're setting everything up for the end.

922
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:30,990
Rym: But before they have you know, the unveiling and the final challenge They have a little bit of retrospective and then they play This montage of the Omega thon.

923
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:37,690
Rym: They had filmed the Omega thon throughout the con and put together this video which then aired at the con.

924
01:01:38,412 --> 01:01:39,235
Scott: Yeah, it was.

925
01:01:39,255 --> 01:01:48,172
Scott: I mean, I've seen people, you know at conventions like, you know with their final cuts Editing together videos like trying to get them up on the internet real quick They.

926
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:59,148
Scott: but this like the job they did on this was like wow You would think that this is a video that they took like a year to make and I don't there no other Convention I think can really pull this kind of thing off.

927
01:02:00,392 --> 01:02:16,824
Rym: And it was really dumb like it was great and the music oh my god, but then at the end of it when they they come down to the last two a minute they basically did the Football sports guy thing and if you don't know what that is when you watch the montage you'll go Oh that football sports guy thing.

928
01:02:17,065 --> 01:02:17,829
Rym: Yeah, it was.

929
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,709
Rym: and then They unveiled it.

930
01:02:22,473 --> 01:02:25,888
Rym: They unveiled the game and the way like well the game.

931
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,073
Scott: well They took the.

932
01:02:27,113 --> 01:02:33,246
Scott: they had the screen on the stage right this big-screen TV or at least a relatively big-screen TV And there was a sheet over it.

933
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:40,590
Scott: So they pull the sheet off and then there's two giant You know video screens left in the right of the stage so you can see what's going on.

934
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:47,435
Scott: There's no way you can see that TV from way back right and it says Nintendo Famicom distance.

935
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:49,221
Rym: see this is brilliant.

936
01:02:49,261 --> 01:02:51,990
Rym: like gave those two guys ever may.

937
01:02:52,070 --> 01:03:01,730
Rym: I don't know if it's them specifically or the people who kind of manage all this but they really have developed This live-action sense of comedic time.

938
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:07,110
Rym: Maybe it's just from doing the comic from so long because you know penny arcade often has a good sense of comedic timing.

939
01:03:07,473 --> 01:03:08,764
Rym: It's starting to carry over to the real world.

940
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:17,490
Rym: like though The staging of the like little reveals as they led up to revealing the game and the commentary they provided was masterful.

941
01:03:17,771 --> 01:03:19,257
Rym: Yeah, it's like we've got.

942
01:03:19,518 --> 01:03:30,548
Rym: you know, we've got another blockbuster game from 1987 and the crowd goes nuts and then they turn it on and you real and you see the Famicom disk system.

943
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:34,044
Scott: and for people Don't know the Famicom disk system in Japan, right?

944
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:37,601
Scott: Obviously, they didn't have the NES They had the Famicom which is pretty much the same thing.

945
01:03:37,641 --> 01:03:39,249
Scott: Only the cartridges are smaller, right?

946
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,559
Scott: However, there was also the Famicom disk system.

947
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:51,088
Scott: and just to get this really quickly because it's not you know that important It was a thing you attached to your Famicom and you put these weird floppy disks into it.

948
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:57,891
Scott: They weren't floppy they were sort of big and plastic but they worked just like floppy disks and you put them in there and then you would put the.

949
01:03:57,911 --> 01:04:20,330
Scott: you know, you had attached this other thing to the cartridge slot which had a cable that connected the disk system and It allowed you to play, you know basically NES games that were better than other NES games but allowed saving and loading to the disk and a lot of games that we had like Metroid or Blades of Steel or Legend of Zelda in Japan.

950
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:23,390
Scott: They were actually Famicom disk system games.

951
01:04:23,771 --> 01:04:29,710
Scott: But over here we got them either with passwords instead of save games or we got them with the battery backup.

952
01:04:29,871 --> 01:04:32,639
Scott: You know save games, so we only had cartridges here.

953
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,127
Scott: They were gonna bring the disk system out in the US, but they didn't.

954
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:39,479
Scott: and in Japan, there were actually a lot of Famicom disk system games.

955
01:04:40,262 --> 01:04:48,090
Scott: and so when you see Famicom disk system, you know It's probably gonna be some Japanese game that we never had in the US.

956
01:04:48,532 --> 01:05:09,484
Rym: So, you know build up build up build up and then versus excite bike appears on the screen and the crowd there's this moment of silence where the crowd shuts up going Like there's an intake of breath as everyone realized like they read it and it takes that second for their brain to register Exactly what it is they're seeing and then the crowd just loses their shit.

957
01:05:09,564 --> 01:05:11,450
Scott: It's like holy shit.

958
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:12,715
Scott: I didn't even know that existed.

959
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:16,930
Scott: I mean, I know a lot of things that exist that people other people don't know exist.

960
01:05:17,592 --> 01:05:19,417
Scott: I didn't know versus excite bike exists.

961
01:05:19,518 --> 01:05:31,078
Scott: I'm sure I'm sure that there are people there besides game and Taika who knew it existed but most of the people there had no clue I had no idea and Then they bring him out and it is weird.

962
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,374
Rym: I also didn't realize that in Japan Player two was on top.

963
01:05:36,037 --> 01:05:37,622
Scott: Yeah, he said it was the Coriolis effect.

964
01:05:38,224 --> 01:05:39,087
Rym: I I don't know.

965
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:39,990
Rym: Japanese are weird.

966
01:05:40,131 --> 01:05:41,689
Rym: Yeah, the live player two would be on top.

967
01:05:42,091 --> 01:05:49,410
Scott: Anyway, so they put this disc in and then it says flip to side B and the crowd again loses their shit.

968
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:53,487
Scott: So the guy flips the disc over and then you know verse excite bike starts playing in verse.

969
01:05:53,528 --> 01:05:54,050
Scott: excite bike.

970
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:56,169
Scott: I got to say this is fucking awesome music.

971
01:05:56,771 --> 01:05:58,717
Rym: Also, I got to say it's fucking awesome game.

972
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:03,150
Rym: versus excite bike holds up today as a good game.

973
01:06:03,331 --> 01:06:05,841
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's excite bike, but it's verse.

974
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:07,810
Scott: that's pretty much all there is to it.

975
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:10,590
Rym: And let me tell you this is a game of turnabouts.

976
01:06:10,851 --> 01:06:14,687
Scott: Yeah, it is so fun thing outside in realize right is I got?

977
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:23,821
Scott: when I got home I guess I set up my emulator my NES emulator to emulate Famicom disk system And I got every Famicom disk system ROM including verse excite bike.

978
01:06:23,941 --> 01:06:33,010
Scott: So we sat there playing them all of course, and I learned that Verses excite bike only comes with three tracks built into it for verses.

979
01:06:33,532 --> 01:06:40,048
Scott: You actually there's a track editor and you can save your tracks on the disc which is the point of having a disc instead of a cartridge.

980
01:06:40,068 --> 01:06:44,109
Scott: and When they were playing it at PAX there were seven tracks.

981
01:06:44,611 --> 01:06:52,438
Scott: so four of those tracks were tracks that I guess gave in taiko or whoever owned that cartridge or own that disc had made in advance.

982
01:06:53,168 --> 01:07:00,366
Scott: and They did a lot of play on those custom tracks and they only did some of the play on the pre-made built into the game tracks.

983
01:07:00,828 --> 01:07:07,230
Rym: and then The omega-thon final began and the first round like, you know, the game starts playing.

984
01:07:07,933 --> 01:07:09,420
Rym: It was amazing.

985
01:07:09,661 --> 01:07:11,469
Rym: Like it was like, oh my god, he's winning.

986
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:23,890
Scott: now He's winning like it was real close back and forth back and forth and when a guy Whoever won the other guy was on the ramp and was literally like one bikes length away from finishing the lap and the crowd like.

987
01:07:24,111 --> 01:07:37,280
Rym: there's something about watching a game of direct competition like this with a crowd of people who understand the game and or into it because it was like oh Losing it.

988
01:07:37,848 --> 01:07:42,639
Rym: and Basically after that first round It was over.

989
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:47,446
Scott: It was just absolutely complete domination by red over blue.

990
01:07:47,467 --> 01:07:55,230
Scott: blue Sucked at excite, but he didn't suck no hair to say my mom playing but he was not good.

991
01:07:55,491 --> 01:07:57,964
Rym: I mean with this well, I'll I'll be honest.

992
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:02,458
Rym: I My I mean, I think I would had a 50/50 shot against the guy who did win.

993
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:09,277
Scott: I Overheated a lot.

994
01:08:09,357 --> 01:08:18,970
Scott: I mean I you know when I was watching him, I was thinking man I never overheat but upon playing the game at home I overheat a little but I don't overheat as much as that guy over.

995
01:08:19,453 --> 01:08:21,790
Rym: He fell every time he hit those little pylon things.

996
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:25,023
Scott: Yeah, I mean the pylon things are real easy to get over.

997
01:08:25,042 --> 01:08:27,314
Scott: You just go back back back back back It's it's.

998
01:08:27,493 --> 01:08:28,560
Scott: he obviously was.

999
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,590
Scott: not a hundred percent is excite bike knowledge.

1000
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:30,751
Scott: He.

1001
01:08:30,872 --> 01:08:38,550
Rym: obviously my guess is that he'd either never actually played excite bike Which a lot of people are like or he had not played it since he was a child.

1002
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:44,770
Scott: Yeah, it didn't have enough and the other guy would and I was sort of rooting for that other guy anyway Because

1003
01:08:44,852 --> 01:08:50,733
Rym: one that guy had a really good style and like he looked like the kind of guy that had he been at RIT I would have been friends with.

1004
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:56,631
Scott: also in the in the montage video that they made, you know that with the high production qualities We talked about

1005
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:57,755
Rym: the guy

1006
01:08:57,774 --> 01:09:03,090
Scott: basically said, you know, the first round of the omega-thon was peggle and the second round was a boom blocks

1007
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:03,895
Rym: Yep, and the

1008
01:09:03,975 --> 01:09:05,930
Scott: third round was geometry Wars, right?

1009
01:09:06,451 --> 01:09:18,669
Scott: So when they were talking to the guy who won, you know before he won He was in the montage video and they said they interviewed him during the geometry words out and he's like, yeah This is the first round where there's a skill based game.

1010
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:24,322
Scott: So I feel like it's you know I've actually got a legitimate shot which of course means I'm going to lose.

1011
01:09:25,045 --> 01:09:25,767
Scott: and he didn't lose.

1012
01:09:25,827 --> 01:09:36,710
Scott: but the fact that he was someone who recognized that the first two games were not skill based and that geometry Wars was Sort of may help me identify with him and root for him a little bit more.

1013
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:40,113
Scott: so he won and Everyone goes.

1014
01:09:40,374 --> 01:09:42,124
Scott: Oh, yeah, you won you're going to Tokyo.

1015
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:44,716
Scott: We hate you, but we Simultaneously cheer for you.

1016
01:09:44,796 --> 01:09:45,379
Rym: All right.

1017
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:45,921
Rym: Yeah.

1018
01:09:45,942 --> 01:09:46,344
Scott: Okay.

1019
01:09:46,404 --> 01:09:47,350
Scott: Why can't I go to Tokyo?

1020
01:09:47,630 --> 01:10:04,388
Scott: Okay, and then Gabe says taiko get your ass in the beanbags and they sit down and they play and One of them was not good at excite bike and one let it just be said that the red bike was.

1021
01:10:04,489 --> 01:10:07,843
Scott: I think the blue Bike was just rigged and gimped and the red bike won every time.

1022
01:10:08,365 --> 01:10:12,768
Scott: it might not have been the players It might have been you know, the red controller was just better and the blue one is.

1023
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:16,043
Rym: yes The red controller was somehow causing these overheating.

1024
01:10:16,264 --> 01:10:16,585
Scott: Yes.

1025
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:17,469
Scott: I'm sure it was.

1026
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:30,009
Rym: and then It ended and the whole crowd like walks out together and oh my god it was like it was crazy and like everyone's talking and Gavin and no one wanted to leave.

1027
01:10:30,089 --> 01:10:35,190
Rym: and Basically, we walk out of the con right and we kind of took a back way out.

1028
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:36,590
Rym: So we got ahead of the rest of the crowd.

1029
01:10:37,231 --> 01:10:41,230
Rym: We're way down the street and we get back on and basically we get back onto the street.

1030
01:10:41,512 --> 01:10:42,578
Rym: We're kind of up a hill a little bit.

1031
01:10:42,619 --> 01:10:43,323
Rym: So we're overlooking.

1032
01:10:43,363 --> 01:10:50,941
Rym: like back toward the con the crowd Leaving the convention center was frightening to behold like it was.

1033
01:10:51,242 --> 01:10:55,738
Rym: basically every street in every direction Was completely full of people.

1034
01:10:55,838 --> 01:10:58,550
Rym: like the sidewalks were completely full.

1035
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:06,630
Scott: Yeah, it's like it was a lot more like, you know when people leave Otakon Which is real big almost as big as PAX but not quite, you know, it's like to you.

1036
01:11:07,591 --> 01:11:10,242
Scott: It's not like this big wave of people coming out.

1037
01:11:10,402 --> 01:11:14,880
Scott: You know, it's like the evil trickle out, you know It's a little crowded but the people are tricking out and dispersing.

1038
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:17,690
Rym: PAX ending was like a football game ending exactly.

1039
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:20,490
Scott: It's just a whole bunch of people going in exactly one direction.

1040
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:25,917
Scott: If you leave like a football game or a baseball game you walk down the ramps You know from the upper levels.

1041
01:11:26,038 --> 01:11:33,470
Scott: or if you're on if you're cool and you're sitting in the lower level You know You're walking out of the gate and it's just this direct flood of people going in one direction.

1042
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:35,398
Scott: and that's what leaving PAX was like.

1043
01:11:35,418 --> 01:11:37,386
Rym: now also remember this the the.

1044
01:11:37,707 --> 01:11:51,670
Scott: basically a 12th of the population of Seattle was leaving the penny arcade Expo simultaneously, but the sidewalks are so wide and So empty, you know on this Sunday that it handled it quite quite fun.

1045
01:11:51,851 --> 01:11:55,390
Scott: Oh, yeah handling the crepe line the crepe line did not handle it at all.

1046
01:11:55,550 --> 01:12:06,850
Rym: But what was amazing was one the locals and the tourists staring at it like what the fuck is going on And to the fact that the state basically Seattle felt really empty the whole time.

1047
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:09,700
Rym: We were there like pretty much at any given time during the day.

1048
01:12:10,082 --> 01:12:19,050
Rym: There was pretty much no one on the streets at PAX people Yeah, but then when packs ended like the street was almost as crowded as a New York Street on an average day.

1049
01:12:19,312 --> 01:12:20,930
Rym: Yeah, but it was nothing but packs people.

1050
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,899
Scott: Well, there were some non pegs people and it was kind of weird.

1051
01:12:23,959 --> 01:12:27,530
Scott: But yeah, and then I guess packs is over, right?

1052
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:30,022
Scott: Yeah, don't refer to that other episode.

1053
01:12:30,042 --> 01:12:31,470
Scott: We did to find out what happened afterwards.

1054
01:12:31,691 --> 01:12:35,027
Rym: Well, the thing is we left right and we're like, alright, let's go to that arcade.

1055
01:12:35,068 --> 01:12:35,530
Rym: the game works.

1056
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:36,634
Rym: Everyone said isn't cool.

1057
01:12:36,654 --> 01:12:40,590
Scott: Oh, yeah, and there was a it said reserved for private parties.

1058
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:43,545
Scott: So we're like, oh, it must be like the packs after party.

1059
01:12:43,605 --> 01:12:44,128
Scott: fuck.

1060
01:12:44,168 --> 01:12:47,300
Rym: we know It was some little bad mitzvah.

1061
01:12:48,124 --> 01:12:48,968
Scott: It's a bot mitzvah.

1062
01:12:49,008 --> 01:12:49,350
Scott: whatever.

1063
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:50,555
Rym: It was some little girls.

1064
01:12:50,615 --> 01:12:52,121
Scott: bot mitzvah happened to be.

1065
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:54,290
Scott: the game works immediately after pack.

1066
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,344
Rym: So, you know you want you look in the window and there's all these pegs.

1067
01:12:57,364 --> 01:13:03,610
Rym: people like walking by going Dammit and looking in the window and in the window is like this tiny party of little girls.

1068
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:07,989
Scott: They would have made so much more money if they would have this kick that bat mitzvah out and let the pegs people in.

1069
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:12,667
Rym: but There's like this little party of like eight-year-old girls 13 years, whatever like there's.

1070
01:13:12,707 --> 01:13:15,417
Rym: but they're you know Like little girls to like family members and whatever.

1071
01:13:15,778 --> 01:13:18,647
Rym: plus I can't tell the difference between anyone under the age of 14.

1072
01:13:18,647 --> 01:13:25,067
Scott: at this point I can tell you need someone who's zero and somebody's five and somebody's yeah, once they're over five.

1073
01:13:25,147 --> 01:13:26,493
Rym: I can't tell yeah They're.

1074
01:13:26,513 --> 01:13:32,158
Rym: basically it's either baby Toddler younger than me older than me.

1075
01:13:32,178 --> 01:13:33,262
Rym: I don't know.

1076
01:13:33,282 --> 01:13:40,655
Scott: I think it's like baby toddler kid teenager college kid Older than me.

1077
01:13:40,815 --> 01:13:43,249
Rym: I don't have trouble telling between teenager and college kid.

1078
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,415
Scott: Sometimes something depends.

1079
01:13:45,475 --> 01:13:48,225
Rym: Yeah, cuz cuz the thing is I feel like I can tell.

1080
01:13:48,285 --> 01:13:53,963
Rym: but then like I go back to our IT And look around and everyone looks like they're 12 to me and I'm like, wow.

1081
01:13:54,224 --> 01:13:54,765
Rym: Good God.

1082
01:13:55,046 --> 01:13:56,270
Rym: Yeah, what's wrong with me?

1083
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:57,475
Scott: I'm not that old.

1084
01:13:57,495 --> 01:13:59,225
Scott: Yeah, my little sister's a college kid.

1085
01:13:59,245 --> 01:13:59,728
Scott: It's fucked up.

1086
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:10,206
Rym: Yeah, so but like people are looking in the window at these little girls are like doing one-step basic mode And failing a DDR and we're just like we should be in there.

1087
01:14:10,226 --> 01:14:10,990
Scott: That's right.

1088
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:18,257
Scott: Oh my god It's just not right that packs should get out and the arcade in town The big fancy arcade run by.

1089
01:14:18,317 --> 01:14:23,154
Rym: so I have a plan and because I have money I'm thinking of doing this Rent it out.

1090
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:30,870
Rym: So pretty much as soon as they announce the dates for the next packs I think I am just going to rent out that arcade on the Sunday after packs.

1091
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:40,669
Rym: That's right for just my own event and we're totally going to have the GeekNights party and I I can't promise this will happen Because I might not get the reservation like I might cost too much.

1092
01:14:40,951 --> 01:14:49,416
Rym: But if I can swing it we are going to have the GeekNights packs after party at PAX 2009 in Seattle.

1093
01:14:49,536 --> 01:14:50,017
Scott: Hell's yeah.

1094
01:14:50,439 --> 01:14:55,753
Rym: I'm totally gonna commit to this unless either it's ludicrously priced or Someone like.

1095
01:14:55,773 --> 01:14:55,813
Rym: in

1096
01:14:55,893 --> 01:15:00,832
Scott: other words if we fail at it, you'll be able to get out without you'll be able to save face But

1097
01:15:00,973 --> 01:15:05,700
Rym: I will not fail unless like I'm forced to fail If there's some other bat mitzvah or something

1098
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,649
Scott: the hard part is gonna be getting enough people to come.

1099
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,216
Rym: I Don't think it will be a problem.

1100
01:15:10,236 --> 01:15:13,610
Scott: We're gonna have to really hand out invitations and whatnot to every cool person.

1101
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:27,110
Rym: Well, the thing is I've actually been talking to the packs people and we're already working on our panel our tentative panel for the next Packs, uh-huh, and let me tell you I think it'll be a good panel equal to beyond Dungeons & Dragons.

1102
01:15:27,771 --> 01:15:28,517
Scott: Maybe we'll see.

1103
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:30,048
Scott: so I got to work hard.

1104
01:15:30,753 --> 01:15:37,989
Rym: Pax was over but we're sticking around another day Which the only other con we've done this before was katsu con and I got to say more and more.

1105
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:41,541
Rym: Sticking around the extra day really makes a con a lot more.

1106
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:42,986
Rym: enjoy a faraway con.

1107
01:15:43,046 --> 01:15:43,487
Scott: It does.

1108
01:15:43,628 --> 01:15:49,539
Rym: yeah kinetic con I don't need to stick around the extra day because I can just drive through the night but for a con like this It's so worth it.

1109
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,869
Scott: It's very worth it.

1110
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:53,710
Rym: So we got nothing to do and we can't go play DDR.

1111
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:59,017
Rym: So we get row and she gets her Asian posse Which is basically We got some of the Asian posse.

1112
01:15:59,077 --> 01:16:07,767
Rym: as far as I'm concerned the people we're about to talk about are Like one half a point away from being the West Coast front row crew.

1113
01:16:07,787 --> 01:16:13,196
Rym: Mm-hmm we gotta call them like the second row crew or something because They're they're just like us.

1114
01:16:13,457 --> 01:16:14,139
Scott: They're there.

1115
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:15,986
Rym: They're like us from the West Coast.

1116
01:16:16,548 --> 01:16:17,170
Rym: Oh my god.

1117
01:16:17,451 --> 01:16:22,170
Rym: So we meet with row and and all those people row her boyfriend and this cool parkour.

1118
01:16:22,591 --> 01:16:24,919
Rym: I just realized I'm gonna admit something horrible.

1119
01:16:24,939 --> 01:16:28,250
Rym: Yeah, the only reason I haven't said her boyfriend's name is because I forgot his name.

1120
01:16:28,612 --> 01:16:31,410
Rym: I don't remember anyone's name, but dude, you were totally cool.

1121
01:16:31,531 --> 01:16:34,590
Rym: Remind me what your name is and I'll say it on the show because you were awesome.

1122
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:38,462
Rym: All right, I feel bad, but I only remember you as Rose boyfriend.

1123
01:16:38,482 --> 01:16:39,645
Scott: I don't remember anyone's name.

1124
01:16:39,665 --> 01:16:40,047
Scott: What do you think?

1125
01:16:42,011 --> 01:16:43,438
Scott: Their forum name if they're lucky.

1126
01:16:44,121 --> 01:16:45,166
Rym: Oh, you know what actually?

1127
01:16:45,186 --> 01:16:54,729
Rym: the other scary thing We met a lot of GeekNights listeners like a Surprising number like I didn't expect as many of our GeekNights listeners to be at PAX and to run into them.

1128
01:16:54,829 --> 01:17:03,030
Rym: among you know 58,000 some people but With the exception of like four or five people everyone we met who was like, oh my god, I listen to GeekNights.

1129
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:05,438
Rym: I'm a big fan Not in the forums.

1130
01:17:06,143 --> 01:17:07,030
Scott: Yeah, what's up with that?

1131
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:10,489
Rym: Our biggest fans with a few exceptions are not in the forums at all.

1132
01:17:10,951 --> 01:17:14,150
Scott: It got a sign up for the forums and everyone who did sign up for the forums.

1133
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:29,023
Scott: All right, if you when you sign up for our forums, it sends out an email that says congratulations You have been approved but depending on who you use for email if you use like Yahoo or Hotmail or something You might not get the email that says you have been approved.

1134
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:32,696
Scott: if you don't get the email Don't worry about it.

1135
01:17:32,736 --> 01:17:37,714
Scott: Just go back to the forums and sign in and odds are 99%.

1136
01:17:37,714 --> 01:17:38,577
Scott: you've been approved.

01:17:38,717 --> 01:17:49,038
Rym: and I'll say this if you if you actually were denied one It'll tell you you were denied and two You're not welcome in the forums Because our says we're real good at figuring out.

1138
01:17:49,058 --> 01:17:52,070
Scott: or it means that you typed into that little box that says why are you joining?

1139
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:52,612
Scott: the forums?

1140
01:17:52,652 --> 01:18:02,844
Scott: if you type something into that box that made it seem like you were a spammer or a bot or Stupid or stupid in which case you were not welcome in the forums Yeah, you should type something better in that box.

1141
01:18:02,884 --> 01:18:08,719
Rym: because I do need to say You know for all you people who are might be newer to GeekNights or you know Listen this and thinking oh, I'll join the forums now.

1142
01:18:09,362 --> 01:18:10,890
Rym: Our forms are not like other forums.

1143
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:13,269
Rym: You could say they're the opposite of the penny arcade forums.

1144
01:18:14,411 --> 01:18:20,409
Rym: Real quick grammar intelligence and non annoyingness are strictly enforced and as a result, there's no one annoying.

1145
01:18:21,935 --> 01:18:27,764
Scott: Anyway So we'll go hang with these people and we decide we're gonna.

1146
01:18:27,884 --> 01:18:29,310
Scott: you know, we got really nothing to do.

1147
01:18:29,411 --> 01:18:30,929
Scott: So we busted out some board games.

1148
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:34,531
Rym: So we go to the lobby of the red line hotel where we're staying because our room, you know It's eat.

1149
01:18:34,571 --> 01:18:35,897
Rym: the lobby was actually really nice.

1150
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:36,780
Rym: There's a fireplace.

1151
01:18:37,061 --> 01:18:39,129
Rym: There's a table and a bunch of couches around it.

1152
01:18:39,652 --> 01:18:41,561
Rym: So we don't want to play a game that not.

1153
01:18:41,581 --> 01:18:43,470
Rym: we don't all know how to play and we want to include it.

1154
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:47,230
Scott: Well, I always you know Whenever someone brings a game that I don't know how to play.

1155
01:18:47,351 --> 01:18:51,918
Scott: I always want to learn how to play because I love learning how to play games But no one else does I don't.

1156
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:52,701
Rym: I would rather learn.

1157
01:18:52,721 --> 01:18:54,447
Scott: I would always rather play a new game.

1158
01:18:54,487 --> 01:18:55,290
Scott: I've never played before.

1159
01:18:55,310 --> 01:19:01,876
Rym: I would rather already know how to play a game so that I can just sit down and play more games with the people Because playing games is the fun part.

1160
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:06,050
Rym: learning a game is just the speed bump between having the game and playing the game.

1161
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:09,004
Scott: I love learning games and seeing how they work and learning.

1162
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:16,269
Rym: Yeah, see I think your problem what you forget to realize is that the amount of time we have to play games is limited and It takes a long time to teach most people a board game.

1163
01:19:16,575 --> 01:19:27,050
Rym: So as a result Every time we want to play board games and you want to play a game that not everyone knows how to play you basically delay Us by an hour while you teach the one person how to play power grid again.

1164
01:19:27,891 --> 01:19:30,011
Scott: Yeah, but I just it's not the tea I don't.

1165
01:19:30,372 --> 01:19:32,200
Scott: I don't like teaching people how to play games.

1166
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,830
Scott: already know how to play is I like learning games?

1167
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:37,681
Rym: I don't already know how to play but that but don't you want to?

1168
01:19:38,022 --> 01:19:40,898
Rym: you can play two games in the time it takes to Teach someone a game.

1169
01:19:40,999 --> 01:19:43,114
Scott: I'm not talking about teaching someone I'm talking about if I'm.

1170
01:19:43,134 --> 01:19:47,190
Scott: if I have to teach someone a game already know how to play then yes, that's annoying.

1171
01:19:47,572 --> 01:19:52,650
Scott: But if I'm learning a game that I don't know how to play and then playing it I don't feel as if that hour was wasted.

1172
01:19:52,730 --> 01:20:00,622
Rym: So whenever we learning a game is as enjoyable for me as playing one see except whenever we learn a game It's always we figure out how to play on our own and teach everyone else.

1173
01:20:01,104 --> 01:20:03,333
Scott: Yeah, it is a problem and do They?

1174
01:20:03,414 --> 01:20:05,950
Scott: it never was an opportunity for someone else to teach me a game.

1175
01:20:06,011 --> 01:20:07,349
Scott: I didn't know but you didn't want to do that.

1176
01:20:07,771 --> 01:20:09,016
Rym: Well also all the game.

1177
01:20:09,036 --> 01:20:10,140
Rym: it would have taken too long.

1178
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:13,789
Rym: if you wanted a we wanted to actually play a game That is true.

1179
01:20:13,991 --> 01:20:14,894
Rym: So we play Carcassonne.

1180
01:20:15,255 --> 01:20:23,061
Rym: and let me tell you at one I won by like a couple hundred points Like I was pretty well, but then not so much.

1181
01:20:23,241 --> 01:20:38,404
Rym: I won by like a ludicrous amount Like I'm not just saying this to like oh my god, but I won by a frightening amount, but then again To to incite my ego I Seriously without exaggeration win about 80 to 90 percent of the games of Carcassonne.

1182
01:20:38,424 --> 01:20:39,126
Rym: I've ever played.

1183
01:20:39,648 --> 01:20:41,773
Rym: Yeah Expansions doesn't matter.

1184
01:20:41,914 --> 01:20:44,081
Rym: any Carcassonne like I always win.

1185
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:46,128
Scott: I don't know what's up with the Carcassonne.

1186
01:20:46,168 --> 01:20:46,830
Scott: Why I can't wait.

1187
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:47,879
Rym: I've told you what to do.

1188
01:20:47,899 --> 01:20:48,685
Rym: You just don't do it.

1189
01:20:48,806 --> 01:20:49,693
Scott: I do it I just not.

1190
01:20:49,753 --> 01:20:51,969
Rym: also you still can't figure out how to win the farm game.

1191
01:20:52,572 --> 01:21:00,428
Rym: You'll always be like I'm gonna beat your in this time and you'll put like your big guy on a farm like early on Then I'll just wall that I didn't put my big guy in a farm.

1192
01:21:00,449 --> 01:21:02,510
Rym: really Well, you've done that in the past to try to head me off.

1193
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:08,339
Rym: But anytime you're in a farm I just wall your farm off and then like You'll you'll be winning like the one big farm in the game.

1194
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:12,866
Rym: and then at the end like in the last five rounds I'll add three guys to the farm.

1195
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:16,104
Rym: But yeah, I won.

1196
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:21,148
Rym: but everyone playing real like it was a good game a Carcassonne.

1197
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:29,619
Rym: and Here's why I say that all you people the Asian Posse and Rowan everyone are Like real close to being front row crew West Coast.

1198
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:30,542
Scott: Well, there's something.

1199
01:21:30,562 --> 01:21:36,165
Scott: there's a culture of people who play You know Euro games in which you sort of have fun with it.

1200
01:21:36,246 --> 01:21:42,208
Rym: in addition to you know Not just Euro games all games because you see the same thing was like the cheese and natural selection.

1201
01:21:42,228 --> 01:21:42,985
Scott: That's true That's true.

1202
01:21:43,511 --> 01:21:53,050
Scott: But it's uh, it's this culture of taking a game and playing the game seriously to win But also adding this meta fun element to the game.

1203
01:21:53,090 --> 01:22:05,133
Scott: For example, you'll see four people playing settlers at a gaming convention and they're taking their game of settlers pretty seriously Except except when they trade they'll say things like y'all got a brick I'll trade two wood.

1204
01:22:05,595 --> 01:22:07,139
Rym: Yep, or the classic.

1205
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,944
Rym: I got a raging wood.

1206
01:22:09,165 --> 01:22:10,869
Rym: Does anyone have some sheep to help me with this?

1207
01:22:12,191 --> 01:22:12,633
Scott: To wood.

1208
01:22:12,873 --> 01:22:14,077
Scott: Oh what for brick?

1209
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:14,739
Rym: Oh my god.

1210
01:22:14,779 --> 01:22:16,024
Rym: We need to do a show on caveman.

1211
01:22:16,044 --> 01:22:17,990
Scott: Talk a whole show on caveman.

1212
01:22:18,493 --> 01:22:19,378
Rym: I think we could do it.

1213
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:26,467
Scott: I think that's the snow crash show Which by the way will be this Thursday no matter what that's right.

1214
01:22:28,073 --> 01:22:28,860
Scott: You like that joke.

1215
01:22:28,901 --> 01:22:29,748
Rym: I like that was good.

1216
01:22:30,631 --> 01:22:38,400
Rym: But you know we do this like when we play El Grande, it's not Aragon It's Amagon and it's and it.

1217
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:42,860
Rym: when it's Galicia we say Galicia, but we don't mean Galicia We mean something else that I'm not gonna mention on the show.

1218
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:50,224
Scott: Yeah, or when we play America and when you play Attica, it's like what are they technically supposed to be?

1219
01:22:50,244 --> 01:22:55,067
Scott: say m4, but we're like other carrots Except I say I'm for I know I wanted to say carrots.

1220
01:22:55,088 --> 01:22:59,820
Rym: so bad We always were like name things like weird things like.

1221
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:04,929
Rym: we'll call things from one gate like for a while We called every Petersburg the Jew.

1222
01:23:05,694 --> 01:23:08,069
Rym: We called like everything in every game.

1223
01:23:08,391 --> 01:23:10,339
Rym: That wasn't the game that has the doge in it.

1224
01:23:10,379 --> 01:23:14,990
Rym: the doge for a while and then we started calling The king the governor and like everything.

1225
01:23:15,592 --> 01:23:21,475
Rym: But then we just like we see the m4 and they look just like carrots, and we're like oh my god They're carrots, and we're like.

1226
01:23:21,777 --> 01:23:22,984
Rym: that's our thing with this game.

1227
01:23:23,044 --> 01:23:28,889
Rym: These are the carrots and Like it just didn't stick and we just say I'm Farah like we tried to do too much with it.

1228
01:23:29,415 --> 01:23:31,334
Scott: Yeah, it's rare But you know you'll.

1229
01:23:31,394 --> 01:23:39,970
Scott: you'll just call you'll come up with your own set of names For things in the game as opposed to the official set of names to add your own humor and your own flavor.

1230
01:23:40,111 --> 01:23:46,715
Rym: So before we get to that though we bust out the Carcassonne set and the first thing I ask is So what expansions do we roll with?

1231
01:23:47,317 --> 01:23:51,669
Rym: and the guys like blah blah blah and blah, and I'm like all right.

1232
01:23:52,771 --> 01:23:54,789
Scott: Basically there were a bunch of expansions in there.

1233
01:23:55,091 --> 01:24:06,349
Scott: We played with the regular game and also with the ins and cathedrals But we played a bunch of other tiles from other expansions, but we didn't actually use their expansion abilities.

1234
01:24:06,389 --> 01:24:06,790
Scott: basically

1235
01:24:07,134 --> 01:24:17,258
Rym: They have an analogous But basically derived from the same idea set as us like they did the same thing like they added a bunch of sets together And they ignore the stupid expansion

1236
01:24:17,278 --> 01:24:21,453
Scott: like they had traders and builders, but we didn't do any trading or building We just use the tiles.

1237
01:24:21,734 --> 01:24:30,389
Rym: and what cemented me as a fast friend with these people as the second question as which was So which farmers going do we use to which he says?

1238
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:39,054
Rym: The correct one obviously and I say is that the one with you know XYZ and he says duh Of course so.

1239
01:24:39,736 --> 01:24:44,010
Rym: and then we start playing and a certain tile comes up, and it's shaped.

1240
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:45,150
Rym: You know it's like it's a weird time.

1241
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:51,970
Scott: It's one of those tiles where you have Castle on the top and the left and also a separate castle on the right, but then grass on the bottom.

1242
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:58,317
Scott: So it's sort of like this pointy grass field that goes in like this little narrow crook Almost like if the grass is water.

1243
01:24:58,337 --> 01:24:59,440
Scott: it would be like a fjord.

1244
01:24:59,922 --> 01:25:05,315
Rym: and the guy says oh inverse wizard hat Name for the tile.

1245
01:25:05,757 --> 01:25:16,626
Rym: and all I want to say they have names for a lot of the tiles just like the inverse wizard hat the clitoris the clitoris style is so great.

1246
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:19,525
Rym: and the thing is you're like What do you mean, and then you see the tile you're like?

1247
01:25:19,767 --> 01:25:19,848
Scott: Oh?

1248
01:25:20,654 --> 01:25:21,121
Rym: There we go.

1249
01:25:21,365 --> 01:25:32,260
Scott: yeah The fact that they named their tiles shows that they share that same common culture of name things in board games weird things And also jump on the cheese and natural selection.

1250
01:25:32,782 --> 01:25:33,866
Rym: ah jumping on the cheese.

1251
01:25:33,946 --> 01:25:36,728
Scott: and thus we have a kid Where it's got jumping on cheese boss?

1252
01:25:38,773 --> 01:25:45,832
Scott: And thus we shared something with them that was special and thus the penny arcade expo 2008.

1253
01:25:45,832 --> 01:25:49,206
Rym: well we into bed yeah, then we went to bed then the next day.

1254
01:25:49,386 --> 01:25:55,204
Rym: so all right We did a show on Friday without like without even a news thing of the day.

1255
01:25:55,565 --> 01:25:57,270
Rym: We did another show on Saturday.

1256
01:25:57,611 --> 01:25:59,176
Rym: We did this show on Sunday.

1257
01:25:59,497 --> 01:26:03,390
Rym: We did a show just about the stuff in Seattle that wasn't directly related to packs.

1258
01:26:04,233 --> 01:26:04,860
Rym: We did it up.

1259
01:26:05,103 --> 01:26:06,753
Rym: Oh my god Did we do a lot of shows about.

1260
01:26:06,774 --> 01:26:14,149
Scott: they're gonna still do more shows because we have to do a show in which we talk About you know fourth ed possibly more in depth yep.

1261
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:17,050
Scott: We had to do a show about via Paletti which we discovered it packs.

1262
01:26:17,191 --> 01:26:20,043
Rym: We have to do a show about the science fiction museum.

1263
01:26:20,646 --> 01:26:21,088
Scott: That's true.

1264
01:26:21,228 --> 01:26:21,610
Scott: That's true.

1265
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:24,383
Rym: we have to do a show a meta show like kind of.

1266
01:26:24,403 --> 01:26:29,382
Rym: you know this was basically the Like live vicariously packs through Rym and Scott.

1267
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:30,767
Rym: we have to do one more show.

1268
01:26:30,787 --> 01:26:31,550
Rym: this won't be right away.

1269
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:33,259
Rym: We'll have a packs break on Tuesdays.

1270
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:37,940
Rym: We'll do a normal Tuesday the next time There's a Tuesday, but then we have to do a show about.

1271
01:26:38,362 --> 01:26:48,170
Rym: you know from a conventioneering perspective You know we're like from a technical perspective Like specifically what it is that makes packs good like how it's run the organization all that sort of stuff.

1272
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:52,001
Scott: Yep, stuff that for people who care about convention behind-the-scenes stuff.

1273
01:26:52,021 --> 01:26:53,365
Rym: We're gonna do a Wednesday show.

1274
01:26:53,385 --> 01:27:05,968
Rym: this will be in a future But it's basically going to be What we learned about running an anime convention from the penny arcade expo, and you might say hey basically to be a?

1275
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:08,404
Scott: scathing criticism of anime convention.

1276
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:18,861
Rym: But at the same time it's going to be a list of suggestions and in the classic suggestions that I will I must admit are Not suggestions we came up with before.

1277
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:20,530
Scott: these are the things we just learned from packs.

1278
01:27:20,852 --> 01:27:22,930
Scott: We were not smart enough to come up with these things.

1279
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:26,584
Rym: There are things we always say like anime con should do this.

1280
01:27:27,146 --> 01:27:31,284
Rym: anime con should do that But these are like whoa like here's a crazy one.

1281
01:27:31,304 --> 01:27:32,209
Rym: Just you guys get an idea.

1282
01:27:32,229 --> 01:27:39,410
Rym: I Realized that the convention feedback panel is a stupid waste of time and no anime con should have one ever again.

1283
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:42,022
Rym: That's right, and you might say what that's crazy.

1284
01:27:42,545 --> 01:27:43,610
Rym: That's how we're gonna roll.

1285
01:27:44,353 --> 01:27:46,221
Rym: Oh like we've like it.

1286
01:27:46,321 --> 01:27:50,719
Rym: we had revelations like we walk around packs And we'd see something and we'd stop and go.

1287
01:27:51,382 --> 01:27:52,145
Rym: oh my god.

1288
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,390
Rym: What if Otakon did that?

1289
01:27:54,071 --> 01:27:55,977
Rym: It would change everything it would.

1290
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:00,050
Rym: and if you say oh, that's just the same show as why was packs good?

1291
01:28:00,151 --> 01:28:00,819
Rym: No, it's not.

1292
01:28:01,325 --> 01:28:05,984
Rym: well Kinda well it is except that why was bags good is two hours long.

1293
01:28:06,004 --> 01:28:07,610
Rym: so we're gonna split it into two different shows.

1294
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:16,550
Rym: Yeah, but in the ever since ConnectiCon two years ago where we went to ConnectiCon and came back with a shall we say?

1295
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:22,430
Rym: Unpleasant review and the con chair and all the people involved emailed us and said you know what?

1296
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:24,900
Rym: Your coverage was justified.

1297
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:28,024
Rym: everything you said was true Put up or shut up.

1298
01:28:29,591 --> 01:28:32,061
Rym: Are you gonna do all the things you said we should do?

1299
01:28:32,282 --> 01:28:34,370
Rym: and we said we'll do whatever you want.

Scott: oh, man and Yeah, what else?

1304
01:28:54,594 --> 01:28:59,070

1307
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:10,585

Rym: It will involve a video camera it will involve a stage It will involve YouTube gay porn and it possibly will involve a DVD gay porn DVD.

1314
01:29:40,473 --> 01:29:49,059
