1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,217
Rym: It's Monday, April 14th.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:12,761
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:15,028
Rym: I'm Scott and this is gig knives.

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,949
Rym: tonight We end up just kind of going off on this nostalgia trip about the 90s Internet.

5
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:26,612
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:35,550
Scott: video is Difficult much more difficult than audio.

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,144
Rym: Let me tell you I've noticed two frightening things However, frightening thing.

8
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:45,314
Rym: the first in the day's worth of filming I've learned that we're already better than pretty much 99% of YouTube.

9
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:52,539
Scott: Well, I think we got better than 99% of YouTube videos because we tried and thought about it.

10
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,467
Scott: It just doing that alone.

11
00:00:54,487 --> 00:01:07,388
Rym: It makes you better because most of the people just turn on a camera and go Yep, but beyond that we've learned that pretty much there is nothing that edits audio video Well without spending a lot of money nothing.

12
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:17,670
Scott: Yeah, we pretty much either have to get the Apple Final cut thingy or the Adobe Premiere After Effects thingy.

13
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,655
Rym: Yeah, there's really.

14
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:22,613
Scott: they're both a Bajillion dollars and there's nothing else.

15
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:25,766
Rym: Everything else is so Absolutely awful.

16
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:28,474
Scott: Well, there's that Sony Vegas people talk about.

17
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:30,100
Scott: I wonder if it's actually any good though.

18
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:33,569
Scott: Yeah, but like Sony I mean how good get Sony board.

19
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:35,093
Rym: It's just awful.

20
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:43,235
Scott: The open-source free stuff is no good, but So anyway, not only do we need the software to edit video and such.

21
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:47,870
Scott: but we actually need a computer because You know, my computer is bleh.

22
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:49,980
Scott: I'm not really using my desktop much anymore.

23
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,520
Rym: I'm also using my laptop and Scott and I have kind of taken turns leapfrogging each other with computers.

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,820
Rym: So I currently have the badass computer and Scott has the marginally useful computer.

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,056
Scott: His computer is not ready for video editing.

26
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:10,320
Rym: really I don't have the software and and as we agreed you are captain video because I got this audio thing down.

27
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,005
Scott: Yeah, I'm captain video apparently.

28
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:16,700
Scott: so I'm gonna have to learn movie making but or at least amateur movie making.

29
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:22,194
Scott: But yeah, I realized that making video and editing video is hard.

30
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:24,240
Scott: being on video is a thousand times harder.

31
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:27,431
Rym: You were staring at the camera like a serial killer.

32
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:30,100
Scott: Well, I I do not look good on a camera.

33
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:35,195
Scott: I Remember looks kind of okay, but I don't know I look not so good.

34
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,340
Rym: Well, I can say one thing.

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,080
Rym: I don't wanna make fun of you, but that's how you look when we do most of our panels.

36
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:40,625
Scott: Maybe I should.

37
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,254
Scott: I don't know what I'm gonna do about that.

38
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:43,260
Scott: Yeah, I don't really care.

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,826
Scott: The thing is stands like straight.

40
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:47,617
Rym: The thing is it's weird to do is stand up straight.

41
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:48,420
Scott: I can't smile.

42
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,207
Scott: I have a hunch on the hunch.

43
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:52,435
Rym: How do I unhunch go to a doctor?

44
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:53,659
Scott: How was the doctor gonna do?

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,338
Rym: They're gonna unhunch you how?

46
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,428
Rym: Chiropractic no, no, no.

47
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:58,910
Rym: Thank you.

48
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,613
Rym: We're a brace.

49
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:01,140
Scott: They're not wearing a brace.

50
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:05,895
Rym: I get that he could make you lay on a posture correcting bed every night.

51
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:07,380
Scott: What's the posture correcting bed?

52
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,419
Rym: Like probably not very comfortable like that.

53
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:12,224
Scott: What other options?

54
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:12,906
Scott: I don't know.

55
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:13,749
Rym: don't have a hunch.

56
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,635
Scott: It's not really an option.

57
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:16,338
Rym: I don't have.

58
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:19,879
Scott: that's like saying Hey, I don't have a penis.

59
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:25,671
Rym: If you My penis is a positive impact on my life.

60
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:26,795
Rym: your hunch not so much.

61
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:28,260
Scott: my hunch is not negative either.

62
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,312
Rym: You're gonna be a humpback.

63
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:33,883
Rym: So Are you?

64
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,266
Scott: are you a humpback ist?

65
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,651
Scott: Yes a quasi modist.

66
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:39,716
Rym: I do not like quasi moto.

67
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:42,736
Rym: I'm not a fan of that, dude What's wrong with him?

68
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:46,747
Rym: face Do you ever read that book?

69
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:48,754
Rym: No, did you ever see the Disney movie?

70
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,399
Scott: No, I saw pictures of it.

71
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:53,231
Rym: Do you even know what it's about a guy?

72
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:54,316
Scott: He's a hunchback.

73
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:55,380
Scott: He lives in the church.

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,009
Scott: He rings the bell, but not easy.

75
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:11,056
Scott: sad because he has no friends except the cute little animals Yes, the cute little and he falls in love with some hot chick and then in the end He kills the bad dude and the hot chick loves him because he's good on the inside.

76
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,300
Rym: That's not quite how it goes.

77
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:18,798
Rym: No, not so much okay kind of like how in the original Little Mermaid it doesn't end happily.

78
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,622
Scott: no No, it doesn't.

79
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:25,164
Rym: but anyway, I think the biggest trouble with video editing we found is that well one We don't know anything about it.

80
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:39,006
Rym: Like we're in the other room and we're we're debating like basically we spend an hour independently driving Like a basic thing of filmmaking that Emily after we spent an hour driving it walked in and basically said yeah That's what you're supposed to do.

81
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,120
Scott: She basically came in and said why don't you guys do this?

82
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:44,399
Scott: We just spent the last hour figuring out that we had to do just that.

83
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:46,625
Rym: It's uh, it's not so easy.

84
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:48,693
Rym: Yeah, also lighting is a lot.

85
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:55,114
Scott: It's hard, especially in a house That's like this with normal, you know living lights as opposed to movie lights.

86
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:56,619
Rym: and the worst thing is everything is yellow.

87
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:04,312
Rym: the reason all the video on the internet is awful is Partly because the amount of I mean to make audio sound good.

88
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:11,197
Rym: GeekNights sounds better than like every goddamn Podcast out there and it took that the professional ones, but even then it's close.

89
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:11,820
Scott: It's pretty good.

90
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,268
Rym: It took a couple hundred dollars worth of equipment.

91
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,773
Rym: We're gonna have to like.

92
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:17,660
Rym: we need lavaliers now.

93
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:22,354
Rym: We need all this equipment to make video look good and sound good.

94
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:23,678
Scott: All right, the other thing right.

95
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:24,300
Scott: is that okay?

96
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:25,906
Scott: First of all, right?

97
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:26,648
Scott: It's like okay.

98
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:30,000
Scott: I have a choice between the here's my choices, right?

99
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,752
Scott: We need another powerful computer to do the video editing.

100
00:05:34,273 --> 00:05:35,136
Scott: choice number one.

101
00:05:35,197 --> 00:05:36,140
Scott: Don't buy a computer.

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,123
Scott: Well, no video.

103
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:38,166
Scott: So that's out.

104
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:40,654
Rym: Well, the other option is Rym does the editing.

105
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:43,583
Rym: but if I do the video editing I'm fine with that.

106
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:47,034
Rym: I'm gonna offload a lot of the other GeekNights work to you.

107
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:48,860
Rym: Yeah, like post making.

108
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:52,280
Scott: Anyway, option number two, right?

109
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:55,408
Scott: I buy a build a computer.

110
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:56,673
Scott: I put Linux on it.

111
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:58,560
Scott: Well, there's no video editing software for Linux.

112
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,126
Scott: So there was.

113
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:00,137
Scott: we would have this problem.

114
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,956
Scott: Option number three I buy I build a computer and I put Windows on it.

115
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:06,824
Scott: That's an okay Option.

116
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:08,211
Rym: you'll get Windows Movie Maker.

117
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:09,498
Rym: Yeah, that's a start.

118
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,764
Rym: actually You know what?

119
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:13,940
Rym: That's better than every open-source video editing program ever written.

120
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,735
Scott: Yeah, the thing is is it's still kind of shitty and it's not perfect.

121
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,500
Rym: You know, it's better than nothing.

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,140
Rym: I'm thinking about editing our first video on my laptop because I have Windows Movie Maker over there.

123
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:28,019
Rym: Yeah, and I have a hundred gigs free.

124
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,594
Scott: Another option is to buy the Mac and you know the.

125
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:36,585
Scott: the advantage of that is it's really easy But it costs so much more money.

126
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,932
Rym: The worst thing is the Mac cost a lot of money.

127
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:41,660
Rym: the software cost almost as much.

128
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:43,788
Scott: Yeah, well the thing is right.

129
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:47,341
Scott: we can get after effects which is Mac only which is like $1,300.

130
00:06:47,341 --> 00:07:01,561
Scott: All right, we can get the Adobe Production Suite, which has flash Photoshop premiere and after effects and a bunch of other things right which is pretty much everything we need and more right and that's $1,800.

131
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:06,148
Scott: but the Educational version is $600 now.

132
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,091
Scott: We're not in school.

133
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:12,645
Scott: So we don't check legally qualify for the educational version, but Because we know people in school.

134
00:07:12,986 --> 00:07:15,213
Scott: We could easily get the educational version.

135
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:19,019
Rym: I still have my RIT ID though I heard they changed the RIT ID.

136
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:26,903
Scott: I'm sure when you go to RIT in a couple weeks someone there will gladly go to the store and you know buy you the Educational version.

137
00:07:26,943 --> 00:07:31,780
Rym: if you give them the money, I'm sure I could talk my way into getting it just by going into the store myself.

138
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:35,900
Rym: Yeah, probably all I have to do is dress all scruffily, right?

139
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,180
Rym: I gotta wear like pajamas and flannel gonna not shave for a couple days.

140
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:49,888
Rym: I kind of stagger in and I go Adobe Yeah, but it's really I'm at like it.

141
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:55,043
Scott: I'm at a troublesome point here cuz I sort of I think the trouble here Right.

142
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,139
Scott: is that back in the day?

143
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,692
Scott: It was so clear like you got a computer with DOS.

144
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:02,317
Scott: then it was so clear.

145
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:09,100
Scott: you got Windows 3.1 there was all the other options, you know, there were Macs, but it was so clear that that was not a good option.

146
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:09,982
Scott: It was obvious.

147
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:12,109
Scott: Windows 95 still obvious 98 still obvious.

148
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:17,226
Scott: then when you got me very obvious Yeah, it's very obvious.

149
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:22,288
Scott: But then as we started to got into like the earlier 2000s like 2003 it was like well XP, you know, I have it for games.

150
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:32,320
Scott: But Linux so obvious right and it's been Linux so obvious at least for the things that I've been doing.

151
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,960
Scott: You know coding and such and just web browsing and IMing and less and less gaming.

152
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:39,078
Scott: Linux has been so obvious.

153
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:54,011
Scott: but now we're at a point actually where we I want to do a lot more things and I sort of need all three OS's and that's the temptation of the Mac Is that the Mac can run all three because then

154
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:56,160
Rym: actually we only need two if you stop gaming

155
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:57,246
Scott: I know I mean.

156
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:02,270
Scott: and the thing is if I buy Windows I can actually probably get by because the Mac doesn't do.

157
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:29,528
Scott: I mean I can have iTunes on Windows and I can use VMware on Windows to run Linux and The OS X doesn't do that much that I really need, you know, but each OS really, you know really good parts and really bad parts and I really I'm starting to feel that they're all sort of equal in ways at this point in time and it's very very difficult because it's making Computing very expensive.

158
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:36,730
Rym: Well, the other thing is that just in terms of what we want to do We knew enough about audio like it cost us less.

159
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,659
Rym: it cost a couple hundred dollars to get into podcasting.

160
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:49,100
Rym: Yeah to get into video at the same Equivalent level like to get into video at the level that we got into podcasting is going to cost many thousands of dollars.

161
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:50,870
Rym: Yep, many thousands.

162
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:55,620
Rym: Yeah, not to mention the Inordinate amount of time it takes to do all this.

163
00:09:55,921 --> 00:10:05,580
Rym: I mean God we spent hours and hours and what we got out of it were 14 flawed takes of something That is in the end gonna be like four minutes long.

164
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,504
Scott: I mean it used to be.

165
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:09,740
Scott: I would go build a computer and I'd be like, this is perfect.

166
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,735
Scott: This is the best computer that I could afford given a you know price performance ratio.

167
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:16,340
Scott: This is everything I wanted.

168
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:25,539
Scott: But now I feel like no matter what computer I buy no matter how much money I spend unless I go and buy a Mac Pro and a new Windows computer and

169
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,725
Rym: Add all the Adobe and

170
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:36,920
Scott: all and the Adobe master suite and everything unless I spend like $20,000 I feel like I'll be not having the perfect thing.

171
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,013
Scott: There is no there is nothing that will satisfy.

172
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:47,980
Rym: You know, what everything has There's plenty that will satisfy if we give up on this wild notion of creating content.

173
00:10:48,784 --> 00:10:49,548
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

174
00:10:49,688 --> 00:11:00,947
Rym: If I give up on creating I wasn't doing GeekNights I would just have a Windows Vista computer with the baddest ass video card in the world for playing games at a VMware for writing code and that'd be it.

175
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,135
Scott: Yeah, pretty much I could do that.

176
00:11:03,477 --> 00:11:04,019
Scott: if that's all.

177
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,993
Scott: no No, I got without without making it without making content.

178
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,120
Scott: I would just need a Linux on my laptop.

179
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,304
Scott: I wouldn't even need a desktop.

180
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:21,615
Rym: actually once I finish my I'm starting to write a Python program that will do Everything I need audio wise because resound is really crappy.

181
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:21,956
Rym: It's just.

182
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,260
Rym: it's just the best thing out there.

183
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:27,400
Scott: So I'm trying to write a command line, you know that Adobe production see comes with a sound booth.

184
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,259
Rym: I know and I know it's really good.

185
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:30,890
Scott: I don't know if it's really good or not.

186
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:32,540
Rym: Who knows it has some good points.

187
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,576
Rym: The thing is if I write this program cuz Python works just fine on Windows.

188
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:37,620
Rym: That's it.

189
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,932
Rym: I will never need to boot back into Linux again ever.

190
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:41,534
Scott: Yeah.

191
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:42,437
Scott: Well, look at that.

192
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,785
Rym: Yeah Python is allowing me to get out of this.

193
00:11:46,086 --> 00:11:51,700
Scott: maybe yeah, it seems like also nowadays a lot more stuff is cross-platform.

194
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,689
Scott: I mean really more than the.

195
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,513
Scott: oh it used to be.

196
00:11:54,573 --> 00:11:56,020
Scott: the OS is really important.

197
00:11:56,523 --> 00:12:02,799
Scott: But now as long as I have Firefox The like other stuff matters a lot less a whole lot less.

198
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:09,958
Scott: I mean like you can tell too cuz back in the day I would customize my desktop heavily super heavily because it mattered.

199
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,380
Scott: now Everything's in the web browser.

200
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:17,840
Scott: So my desktop I just leave it as the default because I'm lazy and it doesn't matter because everything is in Firefox.

201
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,243
Rym: I used to make all these icons to click on but if I look at the icons I've got here I've got two.

202
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:23,406
Rym: I never click on.

203
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:29,344
Rym: one spawns a terminal one opens a folder of my music the third icon Firefox.

204
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:30,951
Rym: I don't even click on that.

205
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:35,525
Scott: Yeah, it's like outside of You know the web browser.

206
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:43,586
Scott: the only really things we need applications for anymore are content creation Mostly and then and get so.

207
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:48,242
Scott: so it's like running a web browser is incredibly easy and cheap Everything.

208
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:59,797
Scott: and then as soon as you step beyond that and you say I actually need an application again Everything suddenly becomes a bajillion dollars and it seems like a crime Because you've been paying nothing for so long because you've only needed a web browsing course.

209
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:01,280
Rym: the other problem It's not really a problem.

210
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:10,620
Rym: I can't blame people who do things for free, but the people developing the open source content creation software Obviously do not actually create content with said software.

211
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:18,672
Scott: Well, some of them do not good kinds like Pavre actually You know, but that's mostly a rendering kind of thing.

212
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:20,499
Rym: Yeah, but like most I mean the gimp.

213
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,107
Scott: Yeah Yeah, the gimp was not made by artists and even Audacity is pretty awful.

214
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:29,894
Rym: If you want to do anything serious with it.

215
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,125
Rym: I mean I guess for music it's okay But I'm really asking.

216
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:38,500
Scott: I have frequently come really close to just you know, I mean I said well the Mac Pro is done.

217
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:46,355
Scott: I'm not considering it anymore because the VMware doesn't do dual screen black But it would just be so easy to just go to the Apple Store tomorrow.

218
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:49,071
Scott: Like fucking give it to me I don't give a shit anymore would really clinch.

219
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:50,340
Rym: it is if and when we get a house.

220
00:13:51,181 --> 00:14:00,670
Rym: Yeah, what we would do is we'd have the recording studio and in that room would be the Mac Pro and the big screen For it and the sound isolation, but

221
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:07,493
Scott: if people want to share it the Mac Pro with me That would much encourage me to meet even if you just shared it with me.

222
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:09,940
Scott: It would be $1,500 instead of 3,000.

223
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,105
Scott: I would just go out and get it tomorrow.

224
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:13,274
Scott: Yeah, but as much as there are problems with it.

225
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:15,649
Rym: Yeah, it's tricky though It is tricky.

226
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:16,275
Rym: I don't know.

227
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:22,320
Scott: I mean, I'm in a computing dilemma, please offer me your advices.

228
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,720
Rym: Yeah, especially if you have a video editing experience you out there actually make video for the internet.

229
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,667
Scott: Yeah, like good video for the Internet's.

230
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:33,760
Rym: if you're not sure if you make good video the answer is probably no.

231
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,155
Scott: Yeah, like we need we should call the ask a ninja guy.

232
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:36,739
Scott: He'd probably know.

233
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:39,128
Scott: Yeah, we can ask him and he would say.

234
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:44,889
Scott: he would say buy the blank any blank, you know Like buy this and then I'll kill you.

235
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,113
Rym: here's the other problem.

236
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:52,600
Rym: a lot of people make content now There's a lot of podcasts and a lot of YouTube whatevers, but and a lot of that content is good.

237
00:14:52,961 --> 00:15:04,970
Rym: But I talked to some of these people who do make the content and their answers are always yeah It takes me like four weeks to put each one of these things together Even podcasters a lot of the podcasters.

238
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,775
Rym: We know it takes them four eight twelve hours to edit One hour long episode of their show.

239
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:14,654
Rym: it takes us 30 seconds to edit GeekNights because we wrote scripts to do it all for us.

240
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:18,053
Scott: Yeah, like most people they I don't think there's any way to make video.

241
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:18,960
Scott: go that quickly.

242
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:20,645
Scott: The thing is right.

243
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:24,597
Scott: boing boing t boing boing is making those boing boing TV things, right?

244
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:25,580
Rym: What do they use?

245
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:29,396
Scott: I don't know what they use but they've been around for six months say they've done 150 episodes.

246
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,060
Rym: Let's just ask him what software they use and what hardware they use and buy whatever they say whatever they say.

247
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:40,860
Scott: So if they say Mac Pro with the After Effects we're not with the Final Cut we're just gonna go buy that.

248
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:45,220
Rym: I don't think I would ship in 50% yet because it would also be your primary computer.

249
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:49,432
Scott: Yeah, well the thing is but I would in all honesty right.

250
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:51,076
Scott: what if we do buy?

251
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:54,113
Scott: let's say we go and buy a Mac Pro We just go to the apples you come downtown.

252
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:54,999
Scott: We going to buy right?

253
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,043
Scott: Really?

254
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:58,720
Scott: My laptop would still be my primary computer.

255
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,753
Scott: I would use the the Mac pretty much or the or the windows.

256
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:03,475
Scott: if we buy that.

257
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:14,064
Scott: I pretty much use it for video editing gaming and Music and I wouldn't use it for my normal computing at all Because my laptop does all that.

258
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:15,469
Rym: Yeah, of course.

259
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,360
Rym: I really need some Google gears for my Google Docs.

260
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:22,615
Scott: We really Google came out with the Google gears and it works at the reader kind of.

261
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:26,194
Rym: but thing is I don't trust half the Little apps that people are making with the Google gears.

262
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:27,120
Rym: I'm just waiting for something.

263
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,811
Scott: I only want Google to use the Google gears, but they're not.

264
00:16:30,193 --> 00:16:31,879
Scott: they made it and they're not using it enough.

265
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:36,650
Scott: Yeah, eventually maybe That's the one problem with web applications.

266
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,360
Scott: is you know, we can't push ourselves forward.

267
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,868
Scott: We're sort of at Google's mercy and they're going.

268
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:45,600
Rym: we could we could use the Google gears and do stuff.

269
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,543
Scott: We just yeah, we could.

270
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:50,457
Scott: we would have to write basically web applications that do everything that Google does.

271
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:55,271
Rym: from what I can see I could write Google apps in Django in like 20 minutes.

272
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:56,495
Rym: No, no, I couldn't.

273
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:58,320
Rym: but anyway, I got some news.

274
00:16:58,561 --> 00:16:59,647
Scott: Well, it's a long opening bit.

275
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:00,110
Scott: Let's do news.

276
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,412
Rym: That's fine.

277
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:01,337
Rym: What do you got?

278
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:04,573
Scott: Oh, okay So, you know flash memory, right?

279
00:17:04,714 --> 00:17:05,900
Scott: It's pretty much in everything.

280
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,675
Scott: Yeah, good the the advantages of flash memory or that you can get a lot of space.

281
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,930
Scott: a lot of you know Digital data in a small amount of physical space.

282
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:19,520
Scott: It's pretty fast kind of fast And you know, he doesn't need electricity.

283
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,880
Scott: So you it'll just sit there and store whatever it's storing for a long time and there's no moving parts.

284
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:26,752
Scott: That's that's pretty great problem with flash memory.

285
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:28,700
Scott: it's fast, but it's not that fast.

286
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,165
Scott: I mean, it's not stupid fast.

287
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:36,006
Rym: It's kind of fast and it's also, you know, eventually it wears out exactly It doesn't wear out.

288
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:41,791
Scott: Yeah, if you look at Scott Johnson, yeah, if you look at one bit in the flash memory Let's say I have one bit of flash memory.

289
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:47,432
Scott: I know that's impossible Technologically speaking, but let's pretend I guess it's not technically impossible.

290
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:50,863
Scott: But yeah pretend you have one bit of flash memory Zero.

291
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:52,530
Scott: I make it want to make it zero.

292
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,634
Scott: make it want to make it zero.

293
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:54,398
Scott: make it want to make it.

294
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:55,221
Rym: make it What.

295
00:17:55,261 --> 00:18:02,066
Rym: well, you can turn it to zero a limited number of times exactly the ten thousandth or so time I turn it to zero.

296
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,976
Scott: It will never turn back to one again.

297
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:05,543
Scott: It's it's dead It'll did.

298
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:09,240
Scott: flash memory if you keep using it eventually dies.

299
00:18:09,702 --> 00:18:16,799
Rym: That's why if you and a lot of people don't realize this if you install Software from a flash drive like a Firefox or all - you or whatever.

300
00:18:17,382 --> 00:18:22,200
Rym: Make sure you get the versions people have made that are designed for a flash drive.

301
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:28,220
Rym: Otherwise programs like audacity are just gonna write a ton of data that I think it ruin it real quick.

302
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:29,940
Scott: This is why on my laptop, right?

303
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,137
Scott: I'm running Linux on my laptop and I got a solid-state drive, but I turned off all log files.

304
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:39,047
Scott: that way I'm not writing data to the.

305
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:43,920
Scott: the solid-state drive slowly kill killing it faster than it's normally gonna kill me softly.

306
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,984
Rym: I Inject a little Dave and Joel there.

307
00:18:47,004 --> 00:18:47,686
Rym: He always sings.

308
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:51,075
Scott: All right, so IBM right a rims.

309
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:52,318
Scott: former rims.

310
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:56,629
Rym: former employer IBM was In all the jobs I've had in my life.

311
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,598
Rym: That was one of the more fun jobs.

312
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:04,795
Scott: anyway They've came up invented a new kind of memory called racetrack memory.

313
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,200
Scott: racetrack is the marketing name.

314
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:07,599
Scott: I'm sure there's a sciency name.

315
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:18,460
Scott: There's probably a really cool internal name - probably but basically the way it works is a video that Explains it really simply and the video is sort of my news, but basically there's a nano wire.

316
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:24,779
Scott: So it's a wire but it's really fucking small like Thousand of these wires together would look like a hair.

317
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:28,760
Rym: I'm sure you're all familiar with it from every cyberpunk thing ever.

318
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:30,935
Rym: It's the coolest weapon anyone can ever wheel.

319
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:43,220
Scott: pretty much so you have a nano wire and on one end you have some zeros the other end you have ones right and In the middle you have zeros and one sort of mixed up and you can push from either side.

320
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:51,380
Scott: So if I push on the one end Right all the sort of zeros and ones in the middle get pushed closer to the zero end.

321
00:19:51,841 --> 00:20:10,779
Scott: It's sort of like having a bunch of beads on an abacus and sliding all of them together while keeping the space in between them the same right and then basically whichever, you know at the spot in the middle you can switch it between zero and one and You can do this really really quickly.

322
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:17,144
Scott: you can just you know, like push, you know, switch push switch push switch push push the other direction switch and It.

323
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,080
Scott: in theory and in practice.

324
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:30,740
Scott: I guess this is gonna make basically eventually if they can come through on the manufacturing end Which are they probably will I would if IBM, you know, I don't think they're going out of business soon.

325
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:38,780
Scott: Right if they hold out You know the however many years it takes them to get this into production and they get it into production into a feasible product.

326
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,446
Scott: Investing in IBM.

327
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:41,189
Scott: good idea.

328
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:42,094
Rym: You know what?

329
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,200
Rym: I just thought of something crazy.

330
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:51,148
Rym: Yeah I'm totally gonna ask my old manager my friends at IBM if they can hook me up with the press contacts and see if I Get an interview with like an engineer or something.

331
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:52,133
Scott: Yeah, I think these.

332
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:53,539
Scott: this wasn't at your IBM.

333
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,180
Scott: This is in California in Silicon Valley the IBM.

334
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:06,059
Rym: But at the same time The way IBM is I'm pretty sure I could get talk to someone who could say something cool to us.

335
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,748
Scott: Maybe maybe the shot say some.

336
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:17,877
Scott: you say exactly what the video says with more sciency words Yes, but then you get the voice of an engineer Especially if it's a cool and we could just have one of our friends pretend they're an engineer and read the.

337
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:21,472
Scott: they could read the Documentation and then well, we have our resident scientist.

338
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:23,280
Rym: We actually haven't had him on the show in a long time.

339
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:24,585
Scott: He's mostly with the biology's.

340
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:26,996
Rym: Yeah, we haven't talked about that in a long time.

341
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:28,020
Scott: There hasn't been much.

342
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,327
Scott: Well, I'm sure there's been something to say.

343
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:31,960
Rym: when was the last time we had him on the show with that pseudoscience episode?

344
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:33,066
Scott: I think I was forever again.

345
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:34,695
Rym: Maybe we should huh?

346
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:35,700
Rym: This is a total aside.

347
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:41,272
Rym: But for Mondays Would you guys be cool if we added like a bit some sort of.

348
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,100
Rym: we get our couple of our scientist friends to record some?

349
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:50,160
Rym: Like I don't know two or three minute quickies like I think you just Skype them up and do an episode about something about what?

350
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:50,982
Rym: Bacteria.

351
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:56,000
Scott: No, I think we should an episode about like organic stuff going food because he likes talking, you know, that's what his job is

352
00:21:56,444 --> 00:22:03,198
Rym: Alright, so instead of skyping him up Why don't we just buy him a train ticket down here so I can record his majestic voice

353
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:05,607
Scott: because We could just wait till he's down here.

354
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:06,833
Rym: Normally he'll come down.

355
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:07,919
Rym: Yeah, we'll get him down here.

356
00:22:08,342 --> 00:22:09,960
Rym: Plus we got to play some teeny anyway.

357
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:11,728
Rym: So this stuff's pretty cool.

358
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:13,439
Rym: But here's something not cool.

359
00:22:13,761 --> 00:22:15,767
Rym: But at the same time you're gonna.

360
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:22,449
Rym: any of you who are not in the IT world yet might wonder how something like this could Happen but I can tell you that with rare exceptions.

361
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:25,419
Rym: This is the way every big company is.

362
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:31,840
Rym: There's an article on slashdot entitled the Dead Sea effect in the IT workplace.

363
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:33,733
Scott: I was in the Dead Sea.

364
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:34,440
Scott: Were you in the Dead Sea?

365
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,354
Scott: I was in a Dead Sea a Dead Sea or the Dead Sea.

366
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:39,860
Rym: I was in a Dead Sea.

367
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,218
Scott: I was in the Dead Sea so that I avoid talking about places.

368
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:43,660
Rym: I've worked.

369
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:52,989
Rym: I mean I talk about IBM a lot cuz I was kind of my first job and I that's when I kind of learned how this whole IT Computer enterprise world worked.

370
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:54,396
Rym: and then I worked for a company.

371
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:57,936
Rym: It was pretty crappy and now I work for like the most awesome company ever.

372
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:02,390
Rym: but The second company there was a Dead Sea.

373
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:13,329
Rym: in terms of IT and there are a lot of Dead Seas out there The Dead Sea idea is that if you have a large company for those you don't know The Dead Sea is like the lowest place on earth.

374
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,533
Scott: I mean, we're not counting.

375
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:15,216
Scott: What is that?

376
00:23:15,256 --> 00:23:16,460
Rym: be the center of the earth?

377
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:16,981
Scott: I know.

378
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:21,900
Scott: but you know, we're counting like, you know the lowest sea level that you wouldn't that be the Marianas Trench?

379
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:23,487
Scott: No, because that's under the sea.

380
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,676
Rym: but isn't is this lower sea level?

381
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:28,290
Rym: technically under the sea There's just no sea level.

382
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,940
Scott: but the sea, you know, you're still up.

383
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,530
Scott: It's where you can stand on Dirt, but be the lowest above sea level that you can be.

384
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:37,380
Rym: but I could stand on dirt at the bottom of the ocean.

385
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:38,769
Rym: I would just be very small.

386
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:42,191
Scott: Well not and not be wet Like you see in a suit.

387
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:43,560
Scott: you understand what I'm saying.

388
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,920
Scott: I could be in a suit now and I could have holes in the bottom as a result of being so low.

389
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:57,080
Scott: Right the all the rainwater and such goes down into the Dead Sea and brings a lot of salt and other minerals down there.

390
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:07,080
Scott: So it's basically it's water that has so much salt and minerals into it Like you literally see big rocks of salt like just you know, popping up like little it's out of the sea.

391
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:10,116
Rym: You can make a very small one by dumping salt into a bathtub.

392
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:19,405
Scott: Yeah And like if you go into the Dead Sea like it's hard to put your body parts underwater like it forces you to float And of course is also.

393
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:23,880
Scott: people are like there's a little company there and they make all sorts of lotions and other bullshit.

394
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:28,060
Scott: You know that's like oh the Dead Sea will heal you because it's special sodium chloride.

395
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:35,577
Scott: Yeah But I can tell you that if you if you do take Dead Sea mud and put it all over you and then rinse It off and little showers they have it does feel good.

396
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:43,180
Rym: Anyway, yeah, so the Dead Sea idea in the IT workplace is that you know, maybe I'll just quote here.

397
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,626
Rym: This will make it easy quote.

398
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:47,599
Rym: many large IT shops work like the Dead Sea.

399
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:51,489
Scott: You float in them really easily and it's hard to sink.

400
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:54,117
Rym: new hires are brought in as management deems it necessary.

401
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:57,408
Rym: the qualifications So they the salt will vary depending on curtain.

402
00:24:57,449 --> 00:25:00,600
Scott: you're there the water employee departure personnel budget etc.

403
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,687
Rym: It's a blah blah blah blah blah.

404
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:09,240
Rym: all things being equal The general competency of the IT department should have a roughly the same distribution as the incoming hires.

405
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,399
Rym: instead What happens is that the most talented and most effective IT?

406
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,565
Rym: Engineers are the ones most likely to leave you Evaporate if you will.

407
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:20,987
Rym: Yep.

408
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:22,896
Rym: They're the ones least likely.

409
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:23,258
Rym: I'm gonna.

410
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:27,933
Rym: I'm gonna Translate the rest of this sentence into what it's actually trying to say.

411
00:25:27,974 --> 00:25:29,520
Scott: smart people don't stick around.

412
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:32,680
Rym: They're the ones least likely to put up with the bullshit.

413
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:40,249
Rym: Yep That plagues large organizations and they're the ones most likely to have other Opportunities lined up that they can readily and easily move to.

414
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:40,891
Rym: Yep.

415
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:43,740
Rym: What tends to remain is the residue.

416
00:25:44,304 --> 00:25:56,637
Scott: This is why if you go to any IT shop Right, you'll basically either find a place like where there's all smart people working together And they're all happy because there's no bullshit at their work and it's all smart people they go.

417
00:25:56,657 --> 00:26:07,180
Scott: Yay All right, or you go to another place where you know, there's a bunch of dumb people and maybe there's some smart people But the smart people are not happy because they have to deal with the dumb people's bullshit.

418
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:12,952
Scott: Now dumb people might also be upset with the bullshit But they can't leave because they're dumb and they can't get new jobs.

419
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:15,020
Scott: the smart people can get new jobs.

420
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,019
Rym: Now they get the hell out.

421
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,606
Rym: There are other situations like IBM kept coming up but there are a lot of like.

422
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:28,232
Rym: if you get beyond the normal idea of a large company and into the idea of a Stupidly large company IBM is a good example of that.

423
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:30,300
Rym: just a company that is just massive.

424
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:31,566
Rym: Yeah, then you get in.

425
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,580
Scott: every situation really is different when you get down to the details.

426
00:26:35,602 --> 00:26:42,390
Rym: There's the third case where you'll have like a pocket of smart people Surrounded by the bullshit of the large organization.

427
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,912
Rym: That's true.

428
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:48,935
Scott: Cuz when you get to such a big company like that, it's really operates like a bunch of smaller companies with loose ties between.

429
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:55,725
Rym: but I worked in a place between working where I work now, which Illustrated this perfectly.

430
00:26:55,785 --> 00:26:58,134
Rym: I got to this company and I was excited about it.

431
00:26:58,195 --> 00:26:59,500
Rym: It was it looked like a fun job.

432
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:03,597
Rym: I was being paid pretty well for what I was gonna be doing and it just seemed awesome.

433
00:27:03,637 --> 00:27:19,459
Rym: all the way and As time went on the guy who I was working under my first manager Quit within a month because he took a high-paying job elsewhere in the financial district Mmm, so they hired a replacement and in that time I worked for some other guy.

434
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:24,760
Rym: The guy I worked for quit and got a much higher playing job in the financial district.

435
00:27:25,323 --> 00:27:27,675
Scott: One of my co-workers were these guys smart guys who were leaving.

436
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:28,620
Rym: they were smart guys.

437
00:27:29,162 --> 00:27:31,290
Rym: I worked for someone else my new manager.

438
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:37,697
Rym: They quit within two weeks Whoa to get a job and this guy was freshly hired.

439
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:42,780
Rym: He was hired I worked for him quit immediately got a high-paying job in the financial.

440
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,891
Scott: So eventually I quit and got a high-paying job in the financial.

441
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:49,556
Rym: Yes, and I can say this.

442
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:52,160
Rym: I can say this honestly I mean I left for a number of reasons.

443
00:27:52,280 --> 00:28:00,127
Rym: Actually, the main reason I left was because the environment was making me kind of sick in a physical way because of where I was Working, you know hospitals.

444
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:03,800
Rym: Yeah in bad parts of New York City every day.

445
00:28:04,402 --> 00:28:08,679
Rym: but I don't think I left ain't a single competent IT person behind.

446
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:15,019
Rym: and there was this kind of environment where if you were smart, you were desperately looking for a job elsewhere.

447
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,878
Rym: and Everyone I talked to with the company who was smart when I said, yeah, I'm quitting said, where are you going?

448
00:28:20,918 --> 00:28:22,233
Rym: Take me with you Oh my god.

449
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:27,803
Rym: And meanwhile I the company I work for now Everyone's smart.

450
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:29,889
Rym: Yeah, and no one's trying to leave.

451
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:32,155
Rym: In fact, people are trying to get in see.

452
00:28:32,215 --> 00:28:33,820
Scott: I recognize this phenomena.

453
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:40,680
Scott: Add other companies, but I've only ever worked for places that had like four or five tech people.

454
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:42,448
Scott: So it's like I don't really.

455
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:46,708
Scott: I can't really see it my own jobs because I don't work anywhere But there's too many people.

456
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,654
Rym: the way around.

457
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:48,620
Rym: this is pretty simple.

458
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:56,509
Rym: All you have to do if you're a company no matter how big you are is make sure That you've whoever you hire.

459
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:06,080
Rym: you always give them opportunities to advance Even knowing that that training that you're paying for could very easily get them a job elsewhere for a lot more money.

460
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:11,380
Scott: Also, make sure that you have more smart IT people than dumb IT.

461
00:29:11,524 --> 00:29:12,983
Rym: Yeah but that's not easy to do.

462
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:20,349
Rym: the way to get it that way is to get people and offer them all this training and and Constantly, like what do you want to learn?

463
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:22,499
Rym: What do you want to do and pay for that training?

464
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:33,217
Rym: and By doing so you'll have a lot of smart people who while they could leave with that knowledge and work somewhere else they're more inclined to stick around because they kind of got this sunk cost.

465
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:42,479
Rym: and also they'll continue to get this training and everyone else is getting this training and everyone else is getting smarter alongside them and Eventually, you'll have only smart people.

466
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,672
Scott: In other words, you have to spoil the IT people who are doing this podcast.

467
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:50,871
Scott: us too are saying you must spoil us Or we will give you the finger.

468
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:52,080
Rym: Yes, but that's kind of true.

469
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,219
Scott: That's it is true.

470
00:29:53,581 --> 00:30:00,420
Rym: Plus it works out really well because there's another thing a side factor to this people who don't take advantage of that free training.

471
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:02,854
Rym: You probably don't want to keep them around.

472
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:07,082
Rym: Oh Snap, especially you make the training during work hours like you.

473
00:30:07,122 --> 00:30:14,053
Rym: let people go on trips like go to this training in Boston for a week and then come back and then do a lecture on what you did.

474
00:30:14,434 --> 00:30:21,877
Rym: and if people won't do that like if You have IT people who seriously won't accept training They're probably not going to be useful in the future.

475
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:25,250
Rym: Nope Anyway, this is an interesting article.

476
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:32,587
Rym: I'd recommend you read it and What I think you should take from it is not so much that oh It's all stupid people and everything's gonna suck.

477
00:30:32,988 --> 00:30:36,780
Rym: take it as smart people can always find their way out.

478
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,768
Rym: Anyway things of the day now, I've brought this up several times.

479
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,094
Rym: I Talk about this.

480
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:52,690
Rym: I've been talking about this on a regular basis since I was in high school.

481
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,476
Scott: We've been talking about this for a long time.

482
00:30:54,516 --> 00:30:56,885
Rym: This has been an issue in my life for years.

483
00:30:56,945 --> 00:31:02,240
Rym: This has been discussing this I personally been an activist against since I was 14.

484
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,710
Rym: Oh, man, because that's when I started driving.

485
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:11,429
Rym: Okay, partly because I lived in Michigan, which is it's awesome to live in Michigan if you like driving.

486
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:13,373
Rym: But anyway Not so awesome.

487
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:17,404
Rym: If you like mass transit, but there's a problem in this country.

488
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:22,902
Rym: We make traffic laws Nominally to make driving safer.

489
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:28,410
Rym: a speed limit should be set Next to a school because there's little kids running out into traffic.

490
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:36,383
Scott: Yeah, and when people you know, if I make an argument saying as speed limits are bullshit Well the thing people always say well, it makes the road safer.

491
00:31:36,504 --> 00:31:43,490
Scott: anything that makes the road safer It's it's hard to argue against if it does indeed make the road safer.

492
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,850
Scott: So every traffic law in theory should be a law that increases safety.

493
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:54,530
Rym: Now, of course the problem with that argument is that all right The speed limit should be five miles an hour everywhere because then no one can get hurt.

494
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,890
Scott: Well, this is a line you have to draw between safety and visibility.

495
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:23,641
Rym: But the problem I have on a fundamental level is that the what traffic laws are actually used for in the most places in the United States is Revenue generation and not even on the large scale not by states not by the feds but by crappy little towns and local police and There's no better evidence of this than in Texas though.

496
00:32:23,661 --> 00:32:33,876
Rym: Texas has done some good things to stop this, Ohio I could tell some stories about Ohio where you can pay tickets with a credit card at the cop and continue on your way at The cop as if the cop is a place.

497
00:32:34,137 --> 00:32:34,378
Rym: Yes.

498
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:35,381
Rym: The cop is a place.

499
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:36,345
Rym: I've stopped there.

500
00:32:36,365 --> 00:32:37,027
Rym: It's a drive-thru.

501
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:43,766
Scott: Good burgers, I Hear the donuts are a little stale and half-eaten.

502
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:48,269
Rym: but In in Fishkill, there's this little town next to us.

503
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:54,330
Rym: And this town is actually really small and it has a lot of problems partly because it only has one road.

504
00:32:54,852 --> 00:32:57,742
Rym: But the town is set up to where the whole town's in one place.

505
00:32:58,384 --> 00:32:59,830
Rym: and then there's a major road.

506
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:07,170
Rym: The only north-south road in this area is the only way to go north without going to the throughway.

507
00:33:08,292 --> 00:33:21,172
Rym: And on this road this town of Fishkill goes across it and the number of police officers that they put on the tiny stretch of this road that they control and the number of tickets that they ride on a daily basis is Frightening.

508
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:28,957
Rym: and as a result this tiny town of Fishkill has the biggest most opulent police station and courthouse You would ever believe.

509
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:30,710
Scott: the town hall is also pretty extravagant.

510
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:32,798
Rym: They have so many cops.

511
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:37,858
Scott: meanwhile here in Beacon a city compared to their town It's not quite as opulent.

512
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:40,570
Rym: Of course, the police in Beacon are very prudent.

513
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:52,270
Rym: I've noticed that I've never seen them doing speed traps and the only time I've ever seen them pull someone over is when someone was Doing something really really stupid like going 60 or 70 miles an hour through the nuns.

514
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,330
Scott: Oh, yeah, the Beacon cops seem pretty reasonable.

515
00:33:54,604 --> 00:33:57,587
Rym: Yeah The one time ever got pulled over in Beacon was cuz my headlight was out.

516
00:33:57,627 --> 00:33:58,050
Rym: and you know what?

517
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:02,504
Rym: My headlight was out and I fixed it the next day cuz my headlight was out.

518
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:03,146
Rym: Yep.

519
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:04,210
Rym: But anyway, I digress.

520
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:10,250
Rym: Red light cameras in theory are a cool idea.

521
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:16,949
Rym: I have no problem with automated enforcement of intelligent traffic law as long as it works now.

522
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:32,261
Rym: The problem here is that red light cameras as far as I've ever been able to tell are put in Never to increase safety never to decrease accidents or deaths never to make traffic flow better But always to generate revenue.

523
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:34,934
Rym: and a lot of people say oh Rym You're just paranoid.

524
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:36,039
Rym: and I point to evidence.

525
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:37,083
Rym: They know you're just paranoid.

526
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:37,826
Rym: more evidence.

527
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:38,610
Rym: Are you just paranoid?

528
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:54,043
Rym: What I'm linking to is yet more evidence that whenever these lights are put in cities and municipalities time and time again always Decrease the time of yellow lights in order to increase the revenue.

529
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:56,270
Rym: They make the intersections less safe.

530
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:59,270
Rym: fatalities and accidents increase dramatically.

531
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,097
Rym: That doesn't make the road safer.

532
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:04,787
Rym: it generates money and I don't I can't.

533
00:35:07,152 --> 00:35:14,850
Scott: The real issue here in other words the town wants your money Because the other only other way to get your money is to raise taxes and piss you off.

534
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,708
Scott: So you won't vote for them.

535
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:21,110
Scott: So in order to get your money they make it so that you die driving your car to get your money now.

536
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,576
Rym: The worst thing is that it's not even just this.

537
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:29,151
Rym: there's actually far more civil liberties implications to all this because speed limits are the same Way.

538
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:37,369
Rym: a speed limit should be a speed limit as in on a straight freeway The speed limit should be fairly high because the odds of an accident are low.

539
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:46,690
Rym: But if the freeway is curvy or you know, it's dangerous like say there's a curve that doesn't appear dangerous But studies show it is dangerous and maybe it's safe.

540
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:52,870
Rym: If you go 35, then I'm all cool with having engineers say this turn you got to go 35.

541
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,569
Rym: I'm gonna make a law gonna put up a sign.

542
00:35:55,133 --> 00:36:10,350
Rym: But there's also evidence that a lot of places put the speed limit well below the median speed well below the safe speed in order to generate revenue and This is never been it been put in more stark relief than this video.

543
00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:11,964
Scott: This video is the video is a thing of the day.

544
00:36:11,984 --> 00:36:12,570
Scott: a long time ago.

545
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,966
Rym: This video was a thing of the day when I still worked at IBM.

546
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:16,528
Scott: Mm-hmm.

547
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:22,767
Rym: Some kids got together in Georgia and the speed limit on this freeway is 55 miles an hour.

548
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:25,262
Scott: That's what it is here in 84.

549
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:26,450
Rym: It's four lanes wide.

550
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:28,835
Rym: They got four cars.

551
00:36:29,638 --> 00:36:30,661
Rym: They got in a line.

552
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:37,329
Rym: They went 55 miles an hour and The chaos that ensues.

553
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:45,649
Rym: there is no Conscionable way to have the speed limit be 55 on this road and a lot of people got really mad about this video.

554
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:55,050
Rym: a lot Of people were saying what they did was illegal and dangerous and blog and to me No, it illustrates that the speed limit of 55 on that road is bullshit.

555
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:57,197
Scott: Now I want to.

556
00:36:57,217 --> 00:37:06,253
Scott: I mean it's obvious to me looking at that road It is probably safe to drive about 80 on that road and if your car can't go 80 and if you can't handle the car Going 80 you

557
00:37:06,273 --> 00:37:08,882
Rym: shouldn't be driving or at least not beyond the

558
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:09,725
Scott: highway at least

559
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:11,070
Rym: but it's tricky.

560
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:15,388
Rym: But I don't want to get into the specifics of that but a lot of people said oh what they did was illegal.

561
00:37:15,428 --> 00:37:26,370
Rym: and I have Here a quote from David Speer a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation in Georgia, and he said the following They didn't do a thing wrong in Atlanta.

562
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:32,730
Rym: The actual effect of it is we expect the people going 75 to move over so that people going 95 can have their way.

563
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:36,228
Rym: and he goes on and on about what was like the whole gist of all this.

564
00:37:36,308 --> 00:37:43,361
Rym: but To all the people who were saying that this is horrible what these kids did and dangerous the cops themselves to it no problem with it.

565
00:37:43,968 --> 00:38:05,401
Rym: and The moral of everything I have to say civil liberties wise is this We've gotten to the point with traffic laws to where the police can effectively pull Anyone over at any time for and they'll always be able to after the fact post-hoc Come up with a legitimate reason for pulling the person over Which opens the door for pulling

566
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:05,682
Scott: over

567
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,750
Rym: anyone that you have anything against?

568
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,722
Rym: Profiling anything and then kind of just going on a fishing expedition.

569
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:16,950
Rym: Oh, hey, I pulled you over Cuz you were going four miles an hour over the speed limit.

570
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:22,030
Rym: Never mind the fact that the speed limit is 40 miles an hour lower than what people normally drive.

571
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:27,611
Rym: Never mind the fact that the actual average speed of drivers on the road is 80 instead of 40.

572
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:34,709
Rym: But I see there's something that might be a marijuana cigarette mashed up in your cigarette tray up jail for you.

573
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:37,849
Rym: Yeah So check out this video.

574
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:40,283
Rym: I know it's an old thing of the day, but everyone should see this.

575
00:38:40,565 --> 00:38:43,500
Scott: check out this article Your articles your actual new thing of the day.

576
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:44,103
Rym: Yes, it is.

577
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:45,450
Rym: They're both my thing of the day.

578
00:38:45,795 --> 00:38:46,670
Rym: That's all I got to say.

579
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:49,370
Rym: This is this is something that bothers me on a lot of levels.

580
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:52,887
Rym: I'd love anyone to have any legitimate argument against me.

581
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:58,230
Scott: Yeah Alright, so this would normally be like a Tuesday thing of the day cuz it's all video gaming.

582
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,699
Scott: But actually I'm gonna it's all teching.

583
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:01,602
Scott: You just don't realize that.

584
00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:03,188
Rym: Oh, I know what you're gonna do.

585
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,071
Scott: Yeah It's.

586
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:09,675
Rym: uh, you know before the show but I would know even if I did not know because I would have known Would you?

587
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:11,950
Scott: oh I would have anyway some dude.

588
00:39:13,072 --> 00:39:19,489
Scott: He wrote the first level of Super Mario Brothers one But he wrote it in JavaScript.

589
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:26,444
Scott: now the reason this is sort of amazing from a tech perspective because JavaScript is not like a programming language.

590
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,549
Scott: you write programs in.

591
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:32,163
Scott: JavaScript is pretty much a language that sort of it's.

592
00:39:32,243 --> 00:39:43,630
Scott: it's a thing that what it's pretty much just for web browsers and what you do is JavaScript is you send the JavaScript code itself from the web server to the web browser.

593
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:50,690
Scott: So your web browser when you visit a website with JavaScript actually downloads the source code of the JavaScript, right?

594
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,709
Scott: and then it actually you know reads all that JavaScript and runs it on its own.

595
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:01,923
Scott: and JavaScript is really only designed to sort of manipulate web pages.

596
00:40:01,943 --> 00:40:26,230
Scott: so you can sort of make things Happen on web pages locally, you know, and for example, you know making you know pull down menus or you know JavaScript, you know did they use it nowadays for a lot of those things where you can you know Make a post on a make a comment post without reloading the page, you know that it's gotten pretty advanced lately.

597
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:30,210
Scott: Actually, you know, I mean I remember back in the day where it was like they made JavaScript.

598
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:32,484
Scott: It was like oh if you want to do cool stuff use JavaScript.

599
00:40:32,524 --> 00:40:35,299
Scott: and then it was like JavaScript is bad don't use it.

600
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,129
Scott: and it was kind of bad and you shouldn't have used it.

601
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:42,345
Scott: But now it's gotten to the point where people worked so hard on JavaScript.

602
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:48,860
Scott: They're like, all right, it sucks but we've Sort of beaten the shit out of it and now we can do things with it.

603
00:40:49,382 --> 00:41:00,070
Scott: and this guy made all of the first level of Mario Super Mario Brothers in JavaScript not only in JavaScript in only 14 K of JavaScript an incredibly small amount of memory.

604
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:01,735
Rym: That's pretty impressive.

605
00:41:01,956 --> 00:41:03,079
Scott: it is pretty impressive.

606
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,370
Scott: now the thing about this is first of all, it's not a perfect implementation.

607
00:41:06,451 --> 00:41:09,750
Scott: I mean you can walk left Which is not correct, right?

608
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,813
Scott: You can walk left off the board at the beginning of the game and then you have to reload because you broke it All.

609
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,590
Scott: the question blocks only have coins, right?

610
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,135
Scott: There's no turtles only goombas.

611
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:22,719
Scott: really there's no stars.

612
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,123
Scott: It's you know, you can't.

613
00:41:24,143 --> 00:41:25,347
Scott: really you don't get big.

614
00:41:25,387 --> 00:41:26,450
Scott: There's no fire flowers.

615
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:31,130
Scott: It's pretty much just walk right don't touch a goon, but don't fall in a hole.

616
00:41:31,311 --> 00:41:32,175
Scott: There's no flag.

617
00:41:32,275 --> 00:41:35,189
Scott: even you just sort of walk off the map at the end and that's it.

618
00:41:35,531 --> 00:41:39,910
Rym: I'll be more impressed if he implements it in reloading cascading style sheets.

619
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:41,389
Scott: Yeah, that's not so good.

620
00:41:41,952 --> 00:41:47,715
Scott: But I got another link in addition to the Mario one in JavaScript link That is a it's.

621
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:51,689
Scott: basically this is dude John Resig, right and I don't know him.

622
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:57,290
Scott: He probably doesn't know me but like I met him once or twice because he was at RIT I think in my class.

623
00:41:57,371 --> 00:42:08,601
Scott: I'm not sure if he's in my class But and he was pretty famous at RIT at least semi-famous because he made the sort of schedule maker program Which was a boon to many a student in those days.

624
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:12,870
Scott: if you knew what the scheduling situation was like at RIT Yeah, it was pretty high quality.

625
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:13,190
Rym: Yeah.

626
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:20,810
Scott: And now he basically he invented jQuery which is like one of the most premier JavaScript libraries in the world.

627
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:27,101
Scott: he wrote a book about JavaScript and He I think I think his job is still.

628
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:30,169
Scott: I think he's the JavaScript evangelist at Mozilla.

629
00:42:30,189 --> 00:42:31,354
Scott: still I think that's his job.

630
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:37,816
Scott: So he's a pretty pretty much like the king of JavaScript in a way and On his website here.

631
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:46,324
Scott: He has a breakdown of exactly how this 14k Super Mario Brothers JavaScript was made like he shows you.

632
00:42:46,404 --> 00:42:47,810
Scott: Oh, here's how he programmed it.

633
00:42:48,092 --> 00:42:50,070
Scott: Here's how he did the images and ASCII.

634
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:53,741
Scott: Here's how he did the whole thing and it's pretty interesting stuff.

635
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:56,650
Scott: if you care about programming or JavaScript or anything like that.

636
00:42:57,232 --> 00:42:58,778
Scott: I think it makes a good thing a day.

637
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,605
Rym: So what are we gonna talk about?

638
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:04,097
Rym: We're holding off on the ITCs alternating for a while.

639
00:43:04,157 --> 00:43:05,102
Rym: give that a little bit of rest.

640
00:43:05,122 --> 00:43:05,745
Rym: We'll bring it back.

641
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:06,227
Rym: Don't worry.

642
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:07,989
Scott: Yep Well, I don't know.

643
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:22,754
Scott: I want you to narrow down exactly what this topic is gonna be because it's sort of and feel like we've got sort of like three like Intermingling show ideas sort of like a Venn diagram and I sort of want to pick just one of those circles and sort of Concentrate on that.

644
00:43:22,855 --> 00:43:25,610
Rym: only because a lot of there's a lot of things about the internet.

645
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,924
Rym: they're a lot of very different now from the way they used to be.

646
00:43:27,944 --> 00:43:48,289
Rym: and we thought of this when people found like my old website and then Scott was talking about his old website and The things that people do on the internet and then over time those things are still hanging around and on one end I think about how People like us used the internet back in the day like in the 90s as opposed to now now come.

647
00:43:48,369 --> 00:44:03,787
Rym: it was completely a different idea, but there's also talk about where are we going with the future where we're kind of the first generation that's going to be dealing with the fact that Everything we do from the beginning on is online forever.

648
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:16,669
Rym: So politicians coming up from our generation Are gonna have to deal with the fact that their Facebook from when they were in college with the solo cups is out there And no one can make it go away.

649
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:19,418
Scott: And you're already seeing stuff like this happening already.

650
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:23,170
Scott: like when people like meet new people they go and they google them right away.

651
00:44:23,735 --> 00:44:25,069
Scott: You know you're seeing people.

652
00:44:25,752 --> 00:44:33,223
Scott: When they go and apply for a job someone googles them and digs up all their internet Bones out of their closet as much as they can.

653
00:44:33,243 --> 00:44:34,970
Rym: Yep, and it's only gonna get worse.

654
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:38,583
Rym: I mean, I eventually I'm curious how society is gonna deal with it.

655
00:44:38,623 --> 00:44:43,978
Rym: because think about this on a fundamental level What are politicians from this generation gonna do?

656
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:47,710
Rym: because the only way to not have anything?

657
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:57,992
Rym: embarrassing or strange from your internet history would be to not be on the internet or to be groomed from birth to be a politician

658
00:44:58,675 --> 00:45:01,283
Scott: and those are not the kind of people I think we want being politicians

659
00:45:01,725 --> 00:45:04,530
Rym: now unless we make some sort of Political case and

660
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:07,007
Scott: That's not good.

661
00:45:08,032 --> 00:45:10,130
Rym: So, I don't know what direction should we go with this?

662
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,530
Rym: Or maybe we'll just talk about the directions we could go and cop out and then do one of those shows next week.

663
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,994
Scott: Now let's talk about.

664
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:21,410
Scott: I want to talk about mostly like the things that we did when the internet was really new.

665
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:23,248
Scott: Like what was the first time you know?

666
00:45:24,052 --> 00:45:31,668
Scott: That way I want to sort of because that seemed to be the interesting and entertaining Thing was like what was the internet like for us back in like the mid to late 90s?

667
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,949
Scott: Like what was the crazy shit going on?

668
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:47,047
Rym: I can say one thing most of these Facebook kids never heard of the first time I ever got one Back, then a lot of people myself included and Scott too early on Weren't quite sure what the internet was as opposed to what we had.

669
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:59,030
Scott: Yeah I mean I had heard that there was this information superhighway thing and I was like, ooh Actually, I had a computer with os2 and there was an icon that said info highway or information superhighway.

670
00:45:59,573 --> 00:46:05,339
Scott: But like it didn't work the computer had a 14-4 modem but it wasn't plugged in and we had to pay.

671
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,713
Scott: I somehow knew we had to pay for something and I got.

672
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:13,030
Scott: we didn't pay for it and we didn't plug the modem in and there's no phone lines.

673
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:24,733
Scott: So like it didn't happen for quite a while, you know, but at other places I had used things like, you know I'd gone to one person's house made compi serve and I went to another person's house at AOL and I went to the comp USA and they had

674
00:46:24,774 --> 00:46:28,608
Rym: AOL and I remember I dial into like local wares boards and things.

675
00:46:28,709 --> 00:46:36,386
Scott: but yeah I remember like some people were like Like dialing into the local library or like people are connecting to work.

676
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:44,790
Scott: and then you know It was sort of like, you know I slowly realized the idea was that computers would connect over the phone lines somehow.

677
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:49,747
Rym: Regardless eventually we got on the internet because all that other stuff is a whole other show.

678
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:53,195
Rym: I had to a wells My first time quite a while.

679
00:46:53,215 --> 00:46:58,770
Rym: I had prodigy classic and then when I first got on the internet, I used prodigy internet.

680
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:03,990
Scott: Yeah, but I was smart and I would actually run AOL to connect minimize it then open up Netscape navigate.

681
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,359
Rym: I never had AOL I used AOL.

682
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,140
Rym: I used a million free accounts when I was trying to hack things I also would use.

683
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:12,569
Rym: there used to be a bug with AOL.

684
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:20,650
Rym: Or if you sent like if you went to the logon thing and you did a certain thing You could crash the AOL login server for your area.

685
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:23,641
Rym: Yeah, and I we would do that periodically.

686
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:26,632
Scott: the main problem with AOL back in those days Right is?

687
00:47:26,652 --> 00:47:28,320
Scott: they provided you with an internet connection.

688
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,190
Scott: They were your ISP, right, which is fine.

689
00:47:31,052 --> 00:47:36,930
Scott: But what they would also do that was problematic is in order to connect you couldn't just dial up.

690
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:47,430
Scott: You had to run this AOL application, which is big monstrous and slow application Especially on old shitty computers at the time, which had almost no memory, you know.

691
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:53,850
Scott: Anyway, basically take up all the memory on your computer and make it really slow just to connect.

692
00:47:54,191 --> 00:48:01,950
Scott: And it wasn't till later when I got my second computer that Pentium 3 that I brought to RIT That I I my parents leaves AOL.

693
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:13,050
Scott: But I switched to using the local phone company is the ISP and I just use Windows dial-up networking And so I didn't have to basically run my computer into the ground just to connect to the internet.

694
00:48:13,351 --> 00:48:15,622
Rym: But again, that's all kind of a separate show.

695
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,129
Rym: I really want to talk about using the internet.

696
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:20,489
Rym: So we'll skip ahead to the first time I ever got on the internet.

697
00:48:21,072 --> 00:48:24,830
Rym: I used Wow actually after prodigy internet because why was amazing?

698
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:28,282
Rym: It was the first like 20 bucks a month all you can use.

699
00:48:28,403 --> 00:48:29,547
Scott: Hey, well, I was 20 bucks a month.

700
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:30,109
Scott: I can use.

701
00:48:30,129 --> 00:48:34,448
Rym: I Was a lot faster - I didn't say wasn't plus I think.

702
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:35,775
Rym: anyway I don't think I didn't.

703
00:48:35,976 --> 00:48:37,102
Rym: could you pay for all?

704
00:48:37,142 --> 00:48:38,710
Rym: you can use AOL that early?

705
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,762
Rym: I don't remember exactly when that came later.

706
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:44,495
Scott: It did come at some point later But I was way.

707
00:48:44,595 --> 00:48:47,028
Scott: I don't think we got AOL until it was unlimited.

708
00:48:47,108 --> 00:48:50,530
Rym: remember I had a cable modem when I was in like a freshman in high school.

709
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,981
Scott: Yeah, we didn't cuz they weren't offered in our area for a while.

710
00:48:53,262 --> 00:48:54,186
Rym: Yeah, I was.

711
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:56,999
Scott: I was using my parents Using a pretty slow DSL.

712
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:59,470
Rym: I use my cable modem to play quick one online.

713
00:48:59,996 --> 00:49:01,190
Rym: Wow, but anyway.

714
00:49:01,551 --> 00:49:11,089
Rym: So the first thing I ever did when I got on the internet was I clicked on the search button and this big search thing Came up and I typed bomb making instructions.

715
00:49:11,752 --> 00:49:14,843
Rym: Wow, you're right because I'd heard yeah, everything's on the internet.

716
00:49:15,044 --> 00:49:19,262
Rym: people make bombs and oh my god I was like, oh man, I'm gonna make me some fireworks.

717
00:49:19,302 --> 00:49:21,070
Rym: I'm gonna blow up a trash can in the woods.

718
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:21,832
Rym: I'm gonna.

719
00:49:22,073 --> 00:49:25,405
Rym: I'm gonna do all the cool things from cuz I saw war games.

720
00:49:25,706 --> 00:49:31,029
Rym: I assumed that I could become Awesome, as long as I could go on the Internet.

721
00:49:31,592 --> 00:49:39,564
Rym: Mmm, and I remember I found a bunch of bomb making things and my whole family was standing around me Like we're not gonna be on the internet and I was the tech guy.

722
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:40,630
Rym: No one else knew anything.

723
00:49:41,272 --> 00:49:49,863
Rym: so the whole family and like the friends of my parents and like the kids from the neighborhood were all standing around as We get it online and they all look.

724
00:49:50,064 --> 00:49:52,195
Rym: and as soon as I type bomb My mom goes.

725
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:52,998
Rym: I knew it.

726
00:49:53,259 --> 00:49:55,790
Rym: My dad goes, let's see how long it takes for the FBI to come.

727
00:49:58,471 --> 00:50:04,188
Rym: And we looked at bomb making instructions determined that they were all fake and I don't know what I did after that.

728
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:09,266
Scott: I Remember doing the chat room thing a lot because it was just something about chat rooms.

729
00:50:09,326 --> 00:50:10,350
Rym: I did that on prodigy.

730
00:50:10,692 --> 00:50:14,832
Rym: I was the head of that magic the gathering role-playing group I remember.

731
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:21,090
Scott: on AOL you could search for like games and there was this one part of AOL Where there's like some games you could download for free.

732
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,643
Scott: They were all really bad games, but they were like made in Visual Basic.

733
00:50:24,984 --> 00:50:26,570
Scott: that just so my kids had put up there.

734
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:28,350
Scott: But I just went in there.

735
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:39,300
Scott: It was like AOL was weird because it felt like you were sort of crawling around and like this Untamed sort of weird dungeon of weird Unorganized shit.

736
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:40,511
Scott: and it was sort of like, you know They're just.

737
00:50:40,531 --> 00:50:51,367
Scott: you really got the feeling even when you were just walking around looking at crap that you were sort of like Actually in a dank dungeon exploring and finding buried treasures, even if the treasures are crappy.

738
00:50:51,407 --> 00:50:52,330
Scott: Yeah, I felt really good.

739
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:53,417
Rym: That's what the web was like.

740
00:50:53,437 --> 00:50:54,685
Rym: I mean even let's go one step further.

741
00:50:54,705 --> 00:50:55,490
Rym: forget the internet.

742
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:02,316
Rym: Let's just talk about the web because the web was a new thing and being on it back then There weren't search engines.

743
00:51:02,537 --> 00:51:06,429
Rym: You couldn't search for things because they didn't work and they wouldn't ever find anything.

744
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:12,248
Scott: Yeah, there were some bastions of like sanity like Yahoo or Alta Vista or web crawler.

745
00:51:12,348 --> 00:51:14,094
Scott: pretty much They didn't really help you.

746
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:19,570
Scott: and whenever you found something outside of like, you know, the obvious it was like.

747
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:21,517
Rym: Oh, I found a thing.

748
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:24,890
Rym: I remember that this is brother because thing no one does this anymore.

749
00:51:24,991 --> 00:51:27,766
Rym: This is a term that was big in the 90s.

750
00:51:28,751 --> 00:51:30,357
Rym: Surfing the web.

751
00:51:30,618 --> 00:51:32,304
Rym: Yeah, people would web surf.

752
00:51:32,626 --> 00:51:33,770
Rym: they would go on the internet.

753
00:51:34,051 --> 00:51:35,776
Rym: They'd go to a website from there.

754
00:51:35,816 --> 00:51:36,820
Rym: They go to the links page.

755
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,886
Rym: They click on another site from there.

756
00:51:39,187 --> 00:51:40,050
Rym: They'd look at the bottom.

757
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,094
Rym: Oh, there's a web ring.

758
00:51:41,335 --> 00:51:43,442
Rym: They'd go through the web ring till they found a site.

759
00:51:43,462 --> 00:51:44,104
Rym: They like there.

760
00:51:44,426 --> 00:51:45,590
Rym: then they'd click on another link.

761
00:51:45,718 --> 00:51:55,109
Scott: Yeah it's like because of the way the net was structured like if you Knew what you wanted like you kind of like a cat kind of want video games and that's how general you had to be right.

762
00:51:55,612 --> 00:52:08,989
Scott: you would sort of reach in that direction and you would end up in a lot of the same places over and over and Like when something spawned out in the distance, it would be really hard to get to but occasionally You would sort of find these things.

763
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:16,278
Rym: website that was like this website lists like all the ROM sites and Maybe a third of the links worked.

764
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:23,310
Rym: but that website was like the best website ever I know right and the dead links are all over the place like you'd expect dead links.

765
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:24,514
Rym: That was also remembered.

766
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:42,170
Rym: there were no tabs back then and I remember back in those days I would have like eight web browser windows open and I'd be surfing like eight different threads Simultaneous like in one web browser, I'd be like looking for Rob's the other web server where the other like web browser window.

767
00:52:42,512 --> 00:52:47,330
Rym: I'd be going through all the art sites looking for like cool arts or It was crazy.

768
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:51,606
Rym: And then of course computers crashed all the time because you couldn't have all those windows open.

769
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,770
Rym: you had eight megabytes of RAM.

770
00:52:53,072 --> 00:52:54,723
Scott: Yeah, I had 16 at that point.

771
00:52:55,106 --> 00:52:57,819
Rym: at that point I'm trying to remember when I got the Pentium Pro.

772
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,970
Scott: I had 16 then but then later I had more.

773
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:07,558
Scott: Yeah, oh Yeah, those are those are great.

774
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:09,450
Scott: I remember playing Mudd's in those days.

775
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:11,470
Rym: That was back when there were ads on the internet.

776
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:18,350
Scott: Like I remember they wait because before there were ads but the ads were sort of like link share things like link exchange.

777
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:24,366
Scott: You know stuff like that link exchange, you know web rings link exchange was like.

778
00:53:24,687 --> 00:53:34,677
Rym: I remember even back then Seeing link exchange on a website was like the sign that this website is crap Anything like that, there are all these things.

779
00:53:35,018 --> 00:53:38,490
Rym: and I remember like GeoCities is where it's at Angelfire.

780
00:53:38,933 --> 00:53:40,849
Rym: Those are where the bad kids are.

781
00:53:41,193 --> 00:53:42,149
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

782
00:53:42,632 --> 00:53:47,930
Rym: Angelfire was where like people would make porn sites but a porn site was something that had one picture on it.

783
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:54,862
Scott: It's like no one had actually the knowledge or the resources to have Actual web hosting or pay for it because it was mostly punk kids.

784
00:53:54,942 --> 00:53:57,090
Rym: and remember GeoCities gave you two megabytes.

785
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,596
Rym: That was a big fucking deal.

786
00:53:58,676 --> 00:54:02,150
Scott: and it wasn't like today where you go to like blog spot and they give you a blog.

787
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:09,130
Scott: It was GeoCities and you have to write static HTML and put it up there and take images and put them up there.

788
00:54:09,431 --> 00:54:10,676
Scott: I know you've all found.

789
00:54:10,736 --> 00:54:12,182
Scott: You can't do any PHP's.

790
00:54:12,423 --> 00:54:12,965
Scott: You can't do it.

791
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:15,311
Scott: All you can do is write HTML's.

792
00:54:15,392 --> 00:54:18,383
Rym: I know you've all found my old one of my old GeoCities sites.

793
00:54:18,523 --> 00:54:20,250
Scott: I can't find my old GeoCities.

794
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:25,015
Scott: It was in Times Square Castle like 1876 or something like that.

795
00:54:25,035 --> 00:54:27,243
Rym: My original GeoCities site, I had several.

796
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:28,006
Rym: I had two.

797
00:54:28,086 --> 00:54:35,844
Rym: that were the clan websites for the various MMO and/or mud clans that I was a member of.

798
00:54:36,326 --> 00:54:51,868
Rym: One of them was for the Magic the Gathering Role-playing circle that I was a member of and one of them was Mephistopheles Realm which included Doom modding and Japanese roms of games.

799
00:54:52,191 --> 00:55:06,179
Scott: See I had one website One GeoCities, but like I actually I remember at one point I moved it to crosswinds.net because crosswinds was awesome because they gave you infinite space, but they were mad slow Mad slow.

800
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:13,250
Rym: Well, no what I did Everyone did is we'd put all our big files on crosswinds, but our real site was on GeoCities.

801
00:55:13,553 --> 00:55:15,130
Scott: Oh, man, that's a good move.

802
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,289
Scott: I should have thought of that back in the day and then they started blocking referrers.

803
00:55:18,571 --> 00:55:22,510
Rym: So we'd go we'd link like through anonymizers because back then those things worked.

804
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:32,050
Scott: But yeah, basically like the first the website I made I basically would like Because it wasn't like a blog right?

805
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:35,825
Scott: What I do is I had like a news section and I didn't have any news.

806
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:40,785
Scott: and then I had When I still believed that there are aliens, I'd made like a UFO section.

807
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:41,890
Scott: I didn't put anything in there either.

808
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:49,009
Rym: Mephistopheles Realm was all dark and because it was a Doom modding site nominally I had PaintShop Pro.

809
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:54,510
Scott: I bought it for 80 bucks and I would like try to draw graphics and things and I did it really poorly.

810
00:55:54,570 --> 00:56:02,272
Scott: I would go on the internet and I found like one tutorial that was like do apply these filters in this order to make It look cool.

811
00:56:02,312 --> 00:56:04,841
Scott: and I did that and I made like plastic text.

812
00:56:04,941 --> 00:56:07,490
Rym: I had that animated gif of that fire.

813
00:56:08,092 --> 00:56:12,410
Scott: Yeah, I made some image maps and oh man image maps.

814
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:16,242
Scott: I had repeating backgrounds that made it impossible to see back when there's the debate.

815
00:56:16,563 --> 00:56:18,730
Rym: frames are good frames are evil.

816
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:20,882
Scott: The thing is like my first one or two.

817
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:21,184
Scott: does I?

818
00:56:21,204 --> 00:56:24,378
Scott: basically I wouldn't actually Other than like writing some.

819
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:34,670
Scott: you know opinions of highest punk high school kid On there Occasionally and you know eventually I think my old site eventually evolved.

820
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:39,170
Scott: It's like this video game NES site that I think is still up somewhere.

821
00:56:40,852 --> 00:56:45,712
Scott: You know, it was mostly crap in terms of content, but I basically learned HTMLs from.

822
00:56:45,732 --> 00:56:49,425
Scott: you know, myspace level all the way up through.

823
00:56:49,445 --> 00:56:50,348
Scott: not so bad.

824
00:56:51,513 --> 00:56:53,243
Rym: I remember eighth or ninth grade.

825
00:56:53,263 --> 00:56:54,410
Rym: Maybe it was earlier.

826
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:56,290
Rym: I don't remember when I was like man.

827
00:56:56,310 --> 00:57:03,437
Rym: I want to make a wet an internet site a website and some guy who was all cool that I knew was like you got to Use the HTMLs.

828
00:57:03,457 --> 00:57:04,561
Rym: I was like, what's that?

829
00:57:04,602 --> 00:57:06,470
Rym: He's like, well say you want something to be bold, right?

830
00:57:07,035 --> 00:57:12,885
Rym: You put a B in front of it And then you put like a slash B after and everything between those two things is bold.

831
00:57:12,905 --> 00:57:13,909
Rym: I was like, that's it.

832
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:16,122
Rym: He was like, yeah, that's it.

833
00:57:17,331 --> 00:57:19,139
Rym: Yeah, I'm making an internet site.

834
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:19,781
Rym: Oh, man.

835
00:57:19,962 --> 00:57:24,283
Scott: So here I found the the final Incarnation of my original website.

836
00:57:24,303 --> 00:57:24,564
Scott: Let's see.

837
00:57:24,584 --> 00:57:25,550
Scott: How well is it working?

838
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:27,574
Scott: It's kind of working.

839
00:57:27,635 --> 00:57:29,121
Scott: Okay, let me make let me just check out.

840
00:57:29,161 --> 00:57:30,969
Scott: Okay, I think the screenshots are all gone.

841
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:32,933
Scott: Some of them are there.

842
00:57:32,973 --> 00:57:35,401
Scott: hold on some of the screenshots are there.

843
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:36,685
Scott: Yeah, it's looking pretty good.

844
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:51,128
Scott: if you go to APRECHE.net Slash old hyphen site SITE slash index dot HTML You will find the sort of final incarnation of the website.

845
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:55,364
Scott: I made that and it was last updated in September 23rd of 2000.

846
00:57:55,364 --> 00:57:57,493
Rym: man I will.

847
00:57:57,614 --> 00:58:04,456
Rym: I would give anyone a t-shirt or something if you can find my original GeoCities website Mephistopheles around them.

848
00:58:04,778 --> 00:58:06,102
Scott: Well on the links page.

849
00:58:06,123 --> 00:58:17,844
Scott: There's a link to MU infinity.com Which is an emulator site that's been gone for 100 years and there's a link to classic gaming.com slash Metroid database Which still exists actually, I think it's part of game spy now or something.

850
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:23,248
Scott: Oh Let's see mp3s, I don't I have an mp3s link but there's no mp3s.

851
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:28,486
Rym: Oh, man, remember mp3s links mp3s sites sites.

852
00:58:29,149 --> 00:58:40,121
Scott: Oh, yeah I got a whole bunch of like screenshots right that I took from Games in playing in the emulator and then I have little reviews I wrote of the different NES games and as any as games.

853
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:43,130
Rym: the weirdest thing to me still thinking back is that there were ads.

854
00:58:44,111 --> 00:58:57,005
Rym: Yeah, like the fact that I there used to be ads on the internet that I would see and they'd be there Right away I was like, wait a minute until the pop-up ads came right before the pop-up ad times.

855
00:58:57,646 --> 00:59:02,770
Scott: the ads were actually Less intrusive than they are now if you don't have the ad blocking?

856
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:08,325
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time even back then I remember immediately thinking how can I not see these?

857
00:59:08,867 --> 00:59:13,461
Rym: Oh, definitely and Hosts file was where it was at back then house files.

858
00:59:13,502 --> 00:59:18,921
Rym: a good way to route every bad thing I ever saw to one twenty seven dot o dot o dot one.

859
00:59:19,061 --> 00:59:19,262
Rym: Yeah.

860
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:25,408
Scott: Yeah, it's a good move good move Any other nostalgia things to say they're not really?

861
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,553
Rym: Frames No frames.

862
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:29,014
Rym: remember.

863
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:34,330
Rym: I had oh remember every website had a million banners at the bottom.

864
00:59:34,511 --> 00:59:35,716
Rym: You'd have the EFF banner.

865
00:59:35,736 --> 00:59:38,990
Rym: You'd have the IE sucks banner or the Netscape sucks ban.

866
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:47,450
Scott: Yeah The blue ribbon free speech on the internet campaign were basically people were fighting for a free speech on the internet even though There wasn't really anyone fighting against free speech on the internet.

867
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,073
Scott: Well, there were.

868
00:59:48,193 --> 00:59:51,749
Scott: it's like they saw it coming and there was like a preemptive defense and it was good.

869
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:55,083
Rym: Yeah, and all these banners and frames are good.

870
00:59:55,143 --> 00:59:55,966
Rym: frames are evil.

871
00:59:56,087 --> 00:59:56,790
Rym: I use frames.

872
00:59:57,192 --> 00:59:58,541
Scott: I used frames that I didn't use.

873
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:02,359
Scott: it's like I. you know It changed daily like one day to be man.

874
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:11,134
Scott: if you use frames you can make a website where you know Your links sort of stay on the side for navigation, but then people thought well since my links are so awesome Why don't I make it?

875
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:14,484
Rym: So if you surf away from my site, my frame is still there.

876
01:00:14,725 --> 01:00:16,250
Rym: and then everyone did that.

877
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:19,602
Scott: Yeah, so then it was like alright frames are bad now.

878
01:00:19,904 --> 01:00:20,727
Scott: So everyone got.

879
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:22,720
Scott: I got rid of my frame So I made an image map.

880
01:00:22,982 --> 01:00:23,870
Scott: then it's like image maps.

881
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:26,359
Scott: I had an image map in a frame at one point as my navigation.

882
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,407
Rym: Wow image maps are great.

883
01:00:28,427 --> 01:00:35,210
Rym: Yeah Yeah, remember I wanted to make animated gifs, but I couldn't figure out how I had jazz paint shop pro.

884
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,410
Scott: So I was alright sad didn't have that though.

885
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:45,230
Rym: I eventually got a pirated copy of Autodesk animator and I spent months trying to make animations and none of them looked good.

886
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:55,410
Scott: Yeah, my at most of the stuff I did though was all text, you know Like I'd make some text fly across or I choose a different font and a different color and a different filter.

887
01:00:55,470 --> 01:01:00,329
Rym: Yeah, I'd use a lot of word art and then I'd take a screenshot of that and then make a gif out of that.

888
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:05,281
Scott: Wow Wow, that was way early thing is that was that was this yet?

889
01:01:05,381 --> 01:01:11,161
Scott: I didn't have the paint shop pro really until Like maybe sophomore year of high school.

890
01:01:11,202 --> 01:01:12,950
Rym: The thing is you always kind of underestimate.

891
01:01:13,031 --> 01:01:19,181
Rym: I think I bought it with some money I made like In all things considered how recently a lot of this was.

892
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:23,955
Rym: like you think wow, I made a website called Mephistopheles realm.

893
01:01:24,176 --> 01:01:25,584
Rym: Yeah, I was in like eighth or ninth grade.

894
01:01:25,624 --> 01:01:26,609
Rym: I wasn't that long ago.

895
01:01:27,131 --> 01:01:27,854
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of.

896
01:01:27,874 --> 01:01:28,637
Scott: it's kind of scary.

897
01:01:28,657 --> 01:01:36,058
Scott: Like it feels like the ancient times, but really Maybe I thought it was cool.

898
01:01:36,078 --> 01:01:38,289
Scott: I'm not even twice as old as I was as then.

899
01:01:38,672 --> 01:01:44,944
Rym: I thought it was cool to turn the tea in Mephistopheles Mid to late 90s like 97 98 here.

900
01:01:45,725 --> 01:01:49,810
Rym: also the fact that the internet was so different back then is to be unrecognizable.

901
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:59,707
Rym: However, the other thing I want to point out the the internet in places like Japan Now is pretty much exactly like the internet was here in the 90s.

902
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:03,130
Rym: Like it's frightening to go to a lot of Japanese websites.

903
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:13,713
Scott: Well some of them also myspace a lot of the bad myspace sites look a lot like myspace Looks like the kind of website that if you didn't know HTML you could use that JavaScript.

904
01:02:14,095 --> 01:02:15,642
Rym: make my HTML thing.

905
01:02:15,662 --> 01:02:18,154
Rym: Yeah on Geo cities I remember.

906
01:02:18,295 --> 01:02:21,390
Scott: actually, you know shockwave flash is everywhere now, right?

907
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,681
Scott: It's all over the net but I remember the first flash.

908
01:02:24,063 --> 01:02:25,993
Scott: there was the first flash I ever saw.

909
01:02:26,013 --> 01:02:29,350
Scott: there was some website and they had some flash games.

910
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:35,010
Scott: It was like play games in the web browser like games that actually played like for real and I was like no fucking way.

911
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:39,873
Rym: I remember after Columbine a lot in like College Humor They made.

912
01:02:39,933 --> 01:02:41,298
Rym: they made like Pico's world.

913
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:43,846
Rym: we're like in a high school and it was like all this.

914
01:02:44,006 --> 01:02:49,670
Scott: people were trying to make games That were social commentary before that but I instead they're like it's all this plug-in.

915
01:02:49,931 --> 01:02:52,560
Scott: So I knew a plugins work as I had them to play video files.

916
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,588
Scott: I remember real player and all that shit.

917
01:02:54,768 --> 01:03:00,910
Scott: Yeah So I installed this plug-in right and then suddenly there's this game.

918
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:04,669
Scott: I was like Lenny lose jocks or something and they're like, I remember the website had a fish on it.

919
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:12,205
Scott: I could try to look it up But there were basically the earliest flash games and now it was ezone.com.

920
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:13,669
Scott: ezone.com still exists.

921
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:15,454
Scott: Holy crap It's a flash game site.

922
01:03:15,695 --> 01:03:23,599
Rym: I just remember going to Newgrounds and all that business and people would make these Animations that by today's standards aren't even like.

923
01:03:24,281 --> 01:03:24,862
Rym: I don't even know.

924
01:03:25,003 --> 01:03:27,449
Rym: there's no radar that they would appear on like.

925
01:03:27,489 --> 01:03:27,830
Rym: they're not.

926
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:28,509
Rym: They're nothing.

927
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,676
Rym: They're below the level of anything.

928
01:03:31,217 --> 01:03:37,517
Rym: and yet people would huddle around a computer and watch these in their 200 by 200 pixel goodness.

929
01:03:37,918 --> 01:03:40,910
Scott: Well, that was like, you know people have finally had CD encyclopedias.

930
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:47,257
Rym: They would watch, you know, we all watch that video of the first 10 seconds of Martin Luther King's speech Really?

931
01:03:47,398 --> 01:03:54,706
Scott: I watched the video the 10 second really incredibly grainy low-resolution clip from Star Wars in Microsoft and Carta.

932
01:03:55,728 --> 01:04:09,058
Scott: and then You know for some reason watching that tiny grainy clip of Star Wars in in Carta was better than watching actual Star Wars VHS yeah Computers internet.

933
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,590
Rym: that was just an nostalgia fest.

934
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,900
Rym: I think we should end there cuz I'm hungry and we didn't really go anywhere.
