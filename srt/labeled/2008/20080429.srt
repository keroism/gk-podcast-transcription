1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,806
Rym: It's Tuesday, April 29th.

2
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:12,568
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,668 --> 00:00:13,189
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:14,994
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:17,260
Rym: Tonight, the board game Risk.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,918
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,118
Scott: So way back, someone lent me, you know, before I had played any Fire Emblem's, someone lent me the GBA Fire Emblem's 1 & 2, right?

8
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:40,512
Scott: I played the first one.

9
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:54,080
Scott: It was okay, but and then I played the second one, you know, since I had them both at the same time, and the second one was far as I didn't bother with the first one, and I got way into the second one, but then I forget why, it was when I was working in the middle of nowhere, you know.

10
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:59,840
Scott: I kind of put it down, and then even though I really liked it, like I couldn't pick it back up.

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,840
Scott: It was sort of one of those things where it's like, if you don't stay on the track, it's like if you get off, you have to get back on at the beginning, or else you're kind of in.

12
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,780
Rym: Kind of like way back in the day, I never actually beat Final Fantasy Legend 1.

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,144
Scott: Legend 1?

14
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:13,740
Scott: Good deal, who cares?

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,619
Rym: That was a good game!

16
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:20,040
Scott: Wait, wait, was Legend 1 the one with the tower that goes- Oh, that's a good one, nevermind!

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,555
Rym: Yeah, it is!

18
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:24,360
Rym: But Legend 2 was good, because that had that ultimate moment with the bad guys.

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,180
Scott: Legend 2 is the one I didn't play, but Legend 3 is my favorite one.

20
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:30,300
Scott: Actually, I think Legend 2- Even though most people hate Legend 3.

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,560
Rym: Legend 2 is probably the best one in terms of gameplay.

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,039
Scott: Man, I don't know, I'm not gonna bother about talking about that.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:43,136
Rym: Scott, if I explain to you how the robot works, I think you'll convert to Legend 2, but anyway- No, Legend 3, your dad is a B2.

24
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:50,740
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but- The reason I stopped playing and never beat Legend 1 was that I was playing, and then I didn't for a while.

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,799
Rym: I was playing other Game Boy games and Game Gear games, and like a year later, I was like, "Oh yeah, I should finish this

26
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:57,060
Rym: game.".

27
00:01:57,763 --> 00:02:01,440
Rym: And I didn't know which way was up and which way was down.

28
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:06,739
Rym: And I walked a bit in one direction, and then like 20 minutes later, I was like, "Am I going the wrong

29
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:06,980
Rym: way?".

30
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:15,260
Rym: So I walked in the other direction, got back 20 minutes, walked another 10 minutes, wasn't sure if that was the right way, said, "Fuck it," and never played the game again.

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,007
Scott: I started the same thing with Golden Sun.

32
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:18,213
Scott: I love Golden Sun, right?

33
00:02:18,253 --> 00:02:20,140
Scott: And I beat Golden Sun 1.

34
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,799
Scott: But Golden Sun 2 is so much bigger.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:32,120
Scott: And you reach a point in Golden Sun 2, this is a little bit of a spoiler, you basically have four characters in Golden Sun 1, and you have four different characters in Golden Sun 2.

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:46,180
Scott: But you reach a point in Golden Sun 2 where the four characters from Golden Sun 1 join the party, so now you have eight people, but you have to, you know- You sort of have to arrange a party of four, so four people sit on the back burner while you actually play with the other four.

37
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:48,552
Rym: Hey, what about Final Fantasy 6?

38
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:49,638
Rym: You have like 12 people.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,682
Scott: I know, I know.

40
00:02:50,883 --> 00:03:00,400
Scott: But the thing is, right, is that you bring over, you use a code, or you use a link cable to bring over the characters you played with in Golden Sun 1 to Golden Sun 2.

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,300
Scott: So it's not just, I mean, if you didn't play Golden Sun 1, they just give you four characters.

42
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:10,500
Scott: But if you did, they load your shit in as your stuff, exactly as it was when you beat Golden Sun 1.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,289
Rym: Hey, even better, Destiny of an Emperor.

44
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:13,294
Rym: You had like 400 characters.

45
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:29,300
Scott: Yeah, but the thing is, is you get to this point, and now you have to manage, right, the items and the gins and the magic of eight people, which is pretty- And it's like at that point- Putting stuff in, taking stuff out.

46
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,983
Scott: Right, it's like.

47
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:31,431
Scott: at that point in the game, I'm like,

48
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:31,954
Rym: ugh,

49
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:47,040
Scott: and I started, and Golden Sun 2 is a lot longer and bigger than Golden Sun 1, so at that point in the game, I'm just kind of like, ugh, and I put it down, and then I really have a hard time picking it back up because I got to manage all that shit, so I got to restart Golden Sun 2 again, but then I forget the story, so I got to restart Golden Sun 1.

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,540
Rym: Did you ever actually play through like Final Fantasy 3 or 5?

51
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,664
Scott: What, the real 3?

52
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:51,749
Scott: Yeah.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,123
Rym: No.

54
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,520
Scott: Okay, because 3 has a similar- 5 was the job one, right?

55
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,700
Rym: Oh, so was 3.

56
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,080
Scott: Oh, those were both the job ones?

57
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,339
Scott: I thought 2 was the job one.

58
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,880
Rym: 2 was different.

59
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,399
Scott: Okay, but 3 and 5 were the jobbers.

60
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:08,340
Rym: 3 and 5 are the kind of modern style hardcore jobbers.

61
00:04:08,822 --> 00:04:09,879
Scott: Yeah, I can't play them.

62
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:17,899
Rym: Both games had the syndrome of, alright, we're in the world, in the world, oh shit, that was a tiny part of the world, here's the real world.

63
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,120
Scott: Yeah, I like that part, that's a cool part.

64
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,120
Rym: Yeah, of course 4 was even better, where it had 3 completely independent worlds.

65
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,779
Scott: Huh, they should make Chrono Trigger DS, I'd play that.

66
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:40,700
Rym: You know, I probably would too, because Chrono Trigger is not the best game ever, from a game mechanic perspective, but in terms of one of those RPG style games, that game was badass.

67
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:50,297
Scott: I think the reason that Chrono Trigger is so great is that it's a turn-based, you know, RPG, just like the Final Fantasies, but it's still playable today, whereas the others are not so much.

68
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:53,259
Rym: 6 is, but only because of the story.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,459
Scott: Right, yeah, pretty much.

70
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:55,920
Rym: The story kind of pulls me along.

71
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:59,199
Scott: And because it's easy, if it was a little bit harder, I wouldn't play it.

72
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,438
Scott: And also if the Ultros wasn't there, I wouldn't play it.

73
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,359
Rym: Ultros, I remember the best thing in the whole game.

74
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,960
Rym: Forget all the tragedy.

75
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,700
Scott: When you go up to that painting.

76
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:23,540
Rym: When you go up to that painting, you're like, wow, you see a painting of Ultros, and you walk up to it, and you wonder what the character's going to say, hit A, and it says, wow, that looks familiar.

77
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:26,579
Rym: And then Ultros fucking pops out of the painting and attacks you.

78
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:27,339
Rym: That's awesome.

79
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,299
Scott: Anyway, so back to my original point was that, you know, I picked up Fire Emblem, and I liked them, but I didn't finish them.

80
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:38,743
Scott: So I've been waiting for Fire Emblem DS, and they have said there's going to be Fire Emblem DS.

81
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,640
Scott: I'm not a fan of the console GameCube Wii Fire Emblem.

82
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,539
Scott: I want the DS game going well, right?

83
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,160
Scott: But it's not, they don't even have a release date.

84
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,480
Scott: There's barely any screenshots.

85
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,620
Scott: There's almost no information.

86
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:52,260
Scott: It's like coming later, maybe in the holiday season, maybe even later than that, right?

87
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,619
Scott: It could be a year away for all I know.

88
00:05:54,301 --> 00:06:01,338
Scott: So I said, you know, I'm going to, there are plenty of, you go to the DS shelf and you see a lot of those no name RPG ish.

89
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,715
Scott: They look like JRPG games, but they're not quite really, you know, and you see plenty of them.

90
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:07,840
Rym: And it's hard to say.

91
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,280
Rym: I mean, I remember way, way back we were in a store and we saw a thousand arms and someone was like, I don't recognize, what's that game?

92
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,539
Rym: And then we realized it was kind of a JRPG, but also a dating game.

93
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:17,956
Scott: Yeah.

94
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:21,500
Scott: So Atlas are the people who made golden son.

95
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,380
Scott: I kind of trust them to be quality, right?

96
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:32,120
Scott: They had this game rondo of swords coming out and I looked at it and I'm like, oh, it looks sort of like fire emblem, but you can attack more than one guy at a time.

97
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,919
Scott: So like if there's three guys lined up, you can just go stab, stab, stab, and stab all three of them in a row.

98
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,418
Scott: Just like move your guy right through him.

99
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:40,060
Scott: And I said, oh, that could be interesting.

100
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:40,356
Scott: Right?

101
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,400
Scott: So I said, you know what?

102
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:41,760
Scott: Fuck it.

103
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,240
Scott: I'll pre-order this shit and then I'll screen it for everybody.

104
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:51,720
Scott: Well, actually I got it and it's like, it's okay, but I haven't played it that much.

105
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:58,800
Scott: And I don't feel this urge to play it some more, but I think I'm gonna, but it's not bad, but it's sort of weird.

106
00:06:58,921 --> 00:06:59,780
Scott: It's not what I expected.

107
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,520
Scott: I expected sort of a fire emblem type of game, right?

108
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,719
Scott: A little, you know, tactics, final fantasy tactics, kind of move around a grid, cast magic spells, stab with swords, right?

109
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:21,300
Scott: But it's actually the fact that you could just walk right through the other guys and they can walk right through you and stab multiple guys in a turn basically means that it's not a tactics game.

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,678
Scott: It's a puzzle game.

111
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:29,422
Scott: They give you a map of bad guys and you have your guys and you have to sort of, you know, figure out.

112
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:39,780
Scott: how do I move my guys along what path, you know, considering how far they can move to where I can kill all the guys that are near enough to me to do some serious hurt,

113
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:40,682
Rym: but,

114
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:44,240
Scott: you know, be out of range of getting seriously hurt on the next round.

115
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:49,040
Scott: And if you like a puzzle game like that, it's, it's kind of a good puzzle game.

116
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:59,840
Scott: There's, you know, some RPG stuff thrown in there, like leveling up and, you know, magic and items or whatever, but that stuff's just all BS because it's not like you really have much of a choice.

117
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,900
Scott: You're just sort of going through the game, solving the policy.

118
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,300
Scott: You can't grind or anything.

119
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:12,040
Scott: You just kill all the bad guys on the screen, you know, but there's multiple endings and there's different, like I'm pretty like on the first map, right?

120
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:16,740
Scott: It's like, you know, you start as a shit ton of bad guys, like way more than you can handle.

121
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,019
Scott: And you've only got like three guys.

122
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:18,439
Scott: Right.

123
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,500
Scott: And like a, there's like a giant army coming from the South.

124
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:26,819
Scott: I'm pretty sure that if you found some way to kill that giant army from the South, then you get like the immediate awesome ending.

125
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:34,700
Scott: But yeah, if you, if that little puzzle game sounds okay, Rondo of swords, but it's not a fire emblem.

126
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,940
Scott: It is not, don't, don't think it's the wrong thing.

127
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,456
Scott: Like I did.

128
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:45,640
Rym: See, it's tough because on one end I want to play a different game, but on the other hand, I'm working on turning all my A's into S's in advanced wars.

129
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,340
Rym: Yeah.

130
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,820
Scott: I mostly picked this up because, uh, I kind of stopped with the advanced wars.

131
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,176
Scott: Yeah.

132
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,980
Rym: But instead of playing mediocre games, maybe you could watch some anime.

133
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:56,137
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

134
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,359
Rym: Got to watch that Bocorano.

135
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,899
Rym: I kind of want to review it full on.

136
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,429
Rym: Oh, well.

137
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:11,779
Rym: So, uh, in the news, instead of talking about gaming news in particular, I want to talk about something that we missed talking about last week, partly because, uh, we totally copped out on half our shows.

138
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:12,938
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

139
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,820
Rym: But at the New York comic con, we were walking around being pressed and I got some good little interviews that I'll pop in here and there whenever they come up.

140
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,440
Rym: And someday we'll do a show on like French comics and that interview I did with the French people will be relevant.

141
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:38,600
Rym: I do want to say the French comics are kind of awesome looking, but we, uh, we wanted over to the upper deck area, upper deck, as you know, it's making the world of Warcraft CCG or T C G as people like to say.

142
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,180
Scott: Basically I would have nothing to care about that game whatsoever.

143
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:42,672
Scott: Right.

144
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,780
Scott: But Gabe and Tyco of penny arcade who have opinions I often respect, uh, they were like, Oh man, this game is so great.

145
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,020
Scott: And also it wasn't the fact that they were saying the game was great.

146
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:59,260
Scott: It was the fact that Tyco was alluding to in the comics and in his post role playing aspects to the game.

147
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,040
Rym: And I was kind of like, Oh, which made us realize something awesome.

148
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:06,900
Rym: So this is an aside, but you'll hear about it soon.

149
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:09,640
Rym: You might all be familiar with the game of diplomacy.

150
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:11,619
Rym: If you're not, it is known.

151
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:21,800
Rym: Like if you don't know, if you're not a gamer, like a tabletop board gamer, or you've never heard of this, find one of your neck bearded gamer friends and be like, Hey, you want to play diplomacy?

152
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,380
Rym: Because he will explain to you that diplomacy is otherwise known as our breaker of friendships.

153
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:28,057
Scott: Yeah.

154
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:39,580
Rym: But, uh, we realized we take a game like diplomacy and add a role playing elements, even if it's a diplomacy sort of has a role playing element, but you can play it in a completely game theory.

155
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,380
Rym: Like, all right, Scott, let's gang up on Alex because of blah, but magic.

156
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,156
Scott: The gathering does not have a role playing element, but it did.

157
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,939
Scott: One could be added.

158
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:57,117
Rym: When I was a kid, remember there was that official way of playing the five pointed star where there were five decks of five different colors and you had to beat the two people across from you.

159
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,299
Scott: But it didn't have a role playing element in the rules.

160
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,339
Rym: Oh no, no, I guess like diplomacy does.

161
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,485
Rym: And diplomacy barely does.

162
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:08,669
Scott: it did barely, but it has some and it does have some, but, um, yeah.

163
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,220
Scott: So I was intrigued by that.

164
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,960
Scott: And actually a lot of people were saying, you know, Oh, D and D, you know, which we basically forsaken, right.

165
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,420
Scott: It's going to become more like a card game.

166
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,320
Scott: Oh, it's going to be like a video game on back in the nineties.

167
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,320
Rym: That was like the biggest fear of everyone in the world.

168
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,380
Rym: People like dragon magazine would have articles from DMS who were like, my game was ruined.

169
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,152
Rym: Everyone comes over and this want to play.

170
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:32,180
Rym: goddamn magic.

171
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,435
Rym: Damn you, Watsy.

172
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,477
Rym: Damn you.

173
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,758
Scott: And then they bought D and D.

174
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:42,200
Rym: But, and then everyone went on, like, but I don't think you understand the level of bitching that we had to go through.

175
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:55,199
Scott: But after reading Tyco's posts about how they were introducing war role playing elements into the world of Warcraft card game, you know, despite not liking the MMO, you know, just because they put the same theme on a card game doesn't mean it's got the same problems the MMO has.

176
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,350
Scott: Right.

177
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:01,100
Scott: I can't immediately just associate the hate based on the, you know, uh, light license of the property.

178
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,270
Scott: Right.

179
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,747
Scott: Um, you know, I said, Hey, that, that could actually be good academically thinking about it.

180
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,480
Scott: Like, huh, a card game with some role-playing.

181
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:12,820
Rym: And we, we even have some ideas, sort of a new thing.

182
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:16,520
Rym: I imagine you could make a kind of simple role playing game with cards.

183
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,180
Rym: That would be awesome.

184
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:29,869
Rym: But I also imagine if you took some mechanics from say birding wheel, but you had this kind of drafting card based character creation for one off scenarios, especially if it's interactive and a shared space kind of deal,

185
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:30,693
Scott: or even

186
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:33,724
Rym: like collectively making all the characters with the cards,

187
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:46,819
Scott: or even like if somehow, you know, like not your whole campaign or whatever, but like encounters could be set with cards, you know, it can have some of the fun elements that like the star fairs of Catan had with like the, you know, the little yes, no pads.

188
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,980
Rym: Or even say you, you, all the players in the game, there's this meta element where you have cards that cause external events, not from your character.

189
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,775
Rym: It's kind of like every player has a hand of like hand of God.

190
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:01,437
Rym: dungeon master does something things.

191
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:05,240
Rym: So we're playing and then say, I'm like, I want to spice this up.

192
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:09,717
Rym: And I just toss out ogre attacks in the night and see what happens, even though I'm in the party.

193
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:10,091
Scott: Yep.

194
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,220
Scott: So that that element of role playing in the card game interested me.

195
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:15,560
Scott: So I said, Hey, we got nothing to do here, right?

196
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:18,340
Scott: Let's go over and we have press badges.

197
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,500
Scott: They will totally like lick our kiss our feet and let and run us a demo of the card game.

198
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:24,859
Scott: And we won't have to pay any money.

199
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,157
Rym: Now.

200
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,000
Rym: It was funny.

201
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,520
Rym: We walked over there and we're like, Hey, we kind of walk in front of this line.

202
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,099
Rym: We're like, Hey, we want to demo the card game and we'd like to film it and record it.

203
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:39,840
Rym: And the guy's like, uh, uh, uh, then he looks, he's the press badge.

204
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,678
Rym: He's like, Oh, right this way, sir.

205
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,140
Scott: And then, but first they were trying to push us on their world of Warcraft miniatures game.

206
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,418
Rym: I want to talk about that first.

207
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:47,800
Rym: Yeah.

208
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,680
Rym: And they're not, they haven't announced all the details yet by packs.

209
00:13:51,821 --> 00:14:04,915
Rym: They're going to have all the details out actually somewhat before then, but there is going to be a world of Warcraft collectible miniatures game and warning bells were going off because one, they had to kind of like force us to go.

210
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,000
Rym: look at this thing too.

211
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:11,420
Rym: They put two incredibly attractive women in charge of making us like this game.

212
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,620
Rym: The rest of it was all just like kind of shlubby, normal gamer dudes teaching you how to play.

213
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,960
Rym: But they had these two women who obviously were kind of, they were booth babes.

214
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:21,739
Scott: I don't think they were booth babes.

215
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,759
Scott: I think one of them was actually the PR person.

216
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,375
Rym: But they were, they were so like, it was so transparent.

217
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:28,480
Rym: what they were trying to do to us.

218
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:28,791
Rym: Yeah.

219
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,599
Scott: It was pretty odd.

220
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:37,539
Scott: I think that's the reason they set up the booth though is, you know, it's like, we want to push our new stuff, you know, more heavily than they want to push their existing stuff.

221
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,360
Rym: But then warning bell number two goes off when the first thing they say is, before we go any further, look at these figures.

222
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:48,740
Rym: Look how high quality these collectible figures are.

223
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:50,500
Rym: Look at that craftsmanship.

224
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,940
Rym: Look at that paint, the drop rates.

225
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,339
Rym: And she actually said the drop rates for rares in boosters are such and such.

226
00:14:59,027 --> 00:14:59,379
Scott: Wow.

227
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,678
Rym: Drop rates.

228
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:01,719
Scott: Yeah.

229
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:02,457
Scott: Yeah.

230
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:05,160
Rym: So we continue and I'm like, so how's the game go?

231
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,739
Rym: She's like, oh, we can't talk about game mechanics.

232
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,959
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

233
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,817
Rym: And I was like, at all.

234
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,738
Rym: They're like, not at all.

235
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:11,419
Rym: And I was like, okay.

236
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:13,640
Rym: And we kind of stood there staring at them.

237
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,679
Rym: Like, well, what the fuck do you expect us to ask now?

238
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,028
Scott: Yeah.

239
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,340
Scott: It's like, we don't give a shit about anything except the game.

240
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:21,459
Scott: We don't care how high quality your miniatures are.

241
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:29,480
Scott: If I want high quality figures, I'll go over to the origin booth where they're selling the, the revolt tech, uh, you know, yotsubox.

242
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:31,080
Rym: Oh man, that yotsubox.

243
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,860
Scott: And the Tezuka Moderna line.

244
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,979
Rym: Also, I got to say there was this, uh, Makoto Kusanagi figure.

245
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,260
Scott: I pretty much decided that that is the only toy company that, that should be allowed to remain in existence.

246
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:55,174
Rym: There seems to be this push that's getting bigger and bigger now, at least in the kind of anime and comic fandom area where they're pushing these very, very high quality kind of like, you know, there's the tchotchkes like the $4 PVC.

247
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,340
Rym: There's like this cheap ass Lupin or this.

248
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:00,820
Scott: It's like a gachapon from like a, you know, a bubble.

249
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,738
Scott: It's, it's cheap.

250
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,260
Rym: But now they're pushing these like super high quality, high class.

251
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:07,820
Rym: Like I live in Manhattan.

252
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:18,698
Rym: I got a fancy apartment with like ultra modern furniture and I have this figure of Mario and this Mario figure is so high class that it fits right in next to the paintings by real artists.

253
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:20,840
Scott: And on the one hand, I kind of like it.

254
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,939
Scott: And the other hand, eh, I could do without it.

255
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,560
Rym: What I was surprised by though, they had this figure of the major from ghost in the shell and the butt was somewhat reasonably sized.

256
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,378
Scott: Yeah, it was, it was a, it was, I'd say it was actually somewhat flat, which lighter than it should be.

257
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,339
Rym: I think that's just because of the, you're, you expected so much, like I expected to look around at it and poke my eye out.

258
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:43,379
Rym: And when it wasn't there, I didn't know what to do.

259
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:44,618
Scott: I guess that's true.

260
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:51,279
Scott: Anyway, so, so the miniature game somewhere Dave Riley's crying, the miniature game, very sad for us.

261
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,799
Scott: They didn't tell us the rules so we couldn't, we couldn't make fun of it.

262
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:54,960
Rym: Pushed him and pushed him.

263
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,699
Rym: And I kept asking like more and more complexly worded questions that basically were, what are the game mechanics?

264
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:06,400
Rym: And they started kind of slipping and we learned that it's like two on two or three on three.

265
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:07,919
Rym: It's not like these big battles.

266
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:08,540
Scott: Yeah.

267
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:13,380
Rym: So it's like, I have my three guys and you have your three guys and it's broken up by faction.

268
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,319
Rym: So if I go Alliance, I can only have Alliance figures.

269
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,240
Rym: And they admitted that yes, some figures are just better in every way, but don't worry.

270
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,917
Rym: The drop rates are real low.

271
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,500
Rym: So Scott asked, wait a minute.

272
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,519
Rym: So if I have more money, I can just make the best thing.

273
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:45,599
Scott: And they were like, uh, uh, uh, uh, the kind of questions that people actually care about game mechanics as are not questions that any PR person from an American game company is prepared to answer.

274
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:46,136
Rym: Yeah.

275
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:48,939
Rym: But they also admitted that there's going to be a mat.

276
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:50,320
Scott: Yep.

277
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:52,519
Scott: Well, they said there's going to be multiple maps.

278
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:53,214
Rym: Yes.

279
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,940
Rym: And the drop rates for those don't get me started.

280
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,879
Rym: They're special.

281
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,700
Rym: Actually, we learned something kind of weird on the aside.

282
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,613
Rym: You know, you go to like, Scott asked about.

283
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:02,380
Rym: this was a good question.

284
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,640
Rym: You know, you go to like a magic tournament or whatever.

285
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:08,740
Rym: And a lot of people have these like big official looking mouse pads.

286
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,940
Scott: Like they'll play, you know, Pokemon, right?

287
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:21,639
Scott: And you can just play Pokemon on a table, but some people have like those mats that have like little squares, like put your deck here, put your Pokemons here, you know, put your discard pile here.

288
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,040
Scott: And it's, you know, and then it says like Pokemon is a big exploding Pokeball.

289
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,600
Rym: So Scott asks, uh, Hey dude, where do you get those things?

290
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,480
Rym: I see them everywhere.

291
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,760
Scott: It's like, whenever I see, whenever I see a tournament or something that people have these mass that they, that are designed for the collectible card game to be played on.

292
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:38,179
Scott: Right.

293
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,766
Scott: Sort of like the board in St.

294
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,339
Scott: Petersburg is just a, it's just a mat designed to play St.

295
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,208
Rym: Petersburg card game.

296
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,499
Rym: Actually just a card game.

297
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:45,647
Rym: Yeah.

298
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,520
Scott: They just comes with a board to play it on.

299
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,000
Scott: And I'm like, you know, I see these mats around all the time, but I'd never seen them for sale in a store.

300
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,739
Scott: Where do you get them?

301
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,199
Rym: He's like the guy looks at us.

302
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,740
Rym: This is the other guy from later, but he basically looks at us like the guy who was actually demoing the card game, not selling the managers game.

303
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,360
Rym: He looks at us for a second, like we're stupid.

304
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:06,840
Rym: And then he says, you get him if you win regional tournaments.

305
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:08,954
Scott: And I'm like, Oh yeah.

306
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:12,980
Rym: And we, and we were like, so you can't just buy them.

307
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,980
Rym: He was like, well, you can usually get them on eBay.

308
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,490
Scott: Yeah.

309
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,820
Scott: I mean, you get anything on eBay.

310
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,340
Rym: But the look was like, it was that moment.

311
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,220
Rym: Cause that was near the end of our little interview where he was like, Oh, wait a minute.

312
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,859
Rym: I don't think these guys are hip to my whole card game and world.

313
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:33,980
Scott: Well, I found one Pokemon card game play mat on eBay, but searching for Pokemon card game mat it's $6.

314
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,059
Scott: And it's not that Japan limited number three.

315
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:37,869
Rym: Only $6.

316
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:38,080
Scott: Yeah.

317
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:42,439
Scott: I don't think that's a, uh, I think that's Japan where you might be able to just buy them on the shelf.

318
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,338
Rym: But it's a limited number three.

319
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,013
Scott: I know.

320
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:45,392
Scott: Right.

321
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:49,100
Scott: Anyway, so the world of core craft card game, right?

322
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,878
Scott: We start playing it.

323
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:55,819
Scott: And it's funny because I didn't want to compare it or associate it to world of Warcraft in any way.

324
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:02,520
Scott: I wanted to sort of separate it in my mind from my opinion of world of Warcraft and examine the card game on its own as a card game.

325
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,000
Rym: We were really trying to be objective.

326
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,779
Scott: If anything, I was going to compare it to magic.

327
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:09,859
Rym: And furthermore, we were trying to kind of get a feel for it.

328
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:18,160
Rym: Not necessarily from the, is it a good straight up game, but also the, could you have fun with it if you're role played or didn't take it seriously.

329
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:25,540
Scott: And I still get the feeling even after playing it, that while I don't think it's, it's that great, which we'll talk about a second.

330
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:32,160
Scott: I do think that if you had a bunch of friends and you played those raids that you could get some role-playing on, I don't know.

331
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:33,865
Scott: And I wouldn't be, it was.

332
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:46,054
Rym: the thing is really leery because of something the guy said near the end where we basically, by the end of this interview, we're sitting there and we're like, so this game is basically 80% debt construction and like 15% luck and 5% tactics.

333
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:52,040
Rym: And the guy was like, yeah, it's all debt construction to which we say.

334
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:54,840
Rym: So then playing doesn't matter at all, does it?

335
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,800
Rym: It's just debt construction.

336
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,497
Rym: That's the game.

337
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:57,600
Rym: Why bother playing?

338
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,540
Scott: Just make a deck, then show your deck to the other person.

339
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:01,618
Scott: They show their deck to you.

340
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,559
Rym: And his response was no, no, no, no, no.

341
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:05,557
Rym: That's not true.

342
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,499
Rym: And we were like, all right, dude.

343
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:08,960
Scott: Yeah.

344
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,320
Rym: But then we were like, well, what about the rage?

345
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,939
Rym: The rage is where the game shines.

346
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:24,380
Rym: And he talked a bit, but the sentence he said was, I forget what raid about which he was talking, but he said, yeah, it's all about just the memorization.

347
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:24,780
Rym: Right?

348
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,566
Rym: So I played, what's it?

349
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:30,080
Rym: raid like 40 times before I finally figured out how to beat it.

350
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:32,080
Rym: And then I just made a deck that beat it like that.

351
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:32,798
Rym: And it was awesome.

352
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:42,180
Scott: I'm like, okay, so I can just buy the raid deck, look at all the cards in it, then look at all the cards I have, figure out exactly which cards I need to beat the raid deck.

353
00:21:42,582 --> 00:21:43,640
Scott: Then what's the point of playing?

354
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,118
Scott: It's like, it's like just buying a jigsaw puzzle almost, and then solving it.

355
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:49,114
Scott: only I need to buy.

356
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,180
Scott: I can't just, I don't get all the pieces.

357
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,840
Scott: I have to keep buying more pieces until I have all the pieces I need to solve the jigsaw puzzle.

358
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Rym: Now, at the same time, we went into this and I was trying not to compare it to magic.

359
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,559
Rym: I mean, I've played a bunch of card games over the years, a little bit, mostly by borrowing decks.

360
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,380
Rym: So I played the Harry Potter game, which was garbage.

361
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,940
Rym: I played Yu-Gi-Oh, which is garbage.

362
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:13,619
Scott: Yeah, I played, I played, I played magic for a while.

363
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,860
Rym: Pokemon was slightly less garbage.

364
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,360
Scott: Pokemon I definitely say is slightly less garbage.

365
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,800
Scott: At least I played the original one and I still have maybe a couple hundred cards.

366
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:24,376
Scott: That's about it.

367
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:25,698
Scott: Maybe not even that.

368
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:34,280
Scott: And that was definitely, it still has all the fundamental problems of a CCG, but in all honesty, it is the best one that I've played.

369
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,719
Scott: I'm sure there might be others out there.

370
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,920
Rym: But I'm trying not to compare it to magic, especially old, old, old magic.

371
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:47,740
Rym: Because remember, I remember when magic almost died and when like buying of magic cards dropped off and all the game stores stopped carrying it for a while.

372
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:50,520
Rym: And that was when I said, wow, magic is dead.

373
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:53,600
Rym: And it wasn't just me like a lot of players at the time agreed.

374
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,918
Rym: Magic is dead.

375
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:58,079
Rym: And the Fallen Empires expansion is what killed it.

376
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:02,340
Scott: I started playing magic when the Fallen Empires was just like, just about to come out.

377
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:02,600
Rym: Yeah.

378
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,880
Rym: There was like this decay.

379
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,200
Scott: Like I bought like a revised and then a Fallen Empires booster.

380
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:08,700
Rym: And then the game kind of faltered.

381
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,200
Rym: Then it was like Ice Age and new players started coming in and the game changed.

382
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,520
Rym: And then the last game of magic I ever played was actually at a regional tournament.

383
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,220
Rym: And it was like three days after alliances.

384
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,179
Scott: That's when I stopped playing as I played a tournament in like Jersey at some hotel and alliances was brand new.

385
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:28,798
Rym: I remember I walked in and I forgot that alliances had come out.

386
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,460
Rym: So I walk in and a kid walks up to me.

387
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,920
Rym: He's like, you want to buy an alliance booster?

388
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,020
Rym: And I was like, no fucking way.

389
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,220
Rym: No, God damn it.

390
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,559
Rym: How much?

391
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:37,439
Rym: He's like 20 bucks.

392
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,454
Scott: No, it wasn't 20 bucks.

393
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:42,700
Rym: No, he said 20 bucks because it was a regional tournament, right?

394
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:44,559
Rym: Where else are you going to get them?

395
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,320
Scott: See, the thing is, I was at the tournament and alliances just came out.

396
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,620
Scott: I went into the dealer's room and they had plenty and they were $2.

397
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,016
Scott: They didn't.

398
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,598
Rym: So this kid was trying to scalp them.

399
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:58,040
Rym: So I was like, man, I can't win the tournament now because people are going to buy all the good alliance cards and win.

400
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,400
Rym: And then I walk into the tournament room and there's the biggest hand drawn poster I've ever seen.

401
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,860
Rym: It was like a big piece of poster with electrical tape forming the letters.

402
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:09,820
Rym: And it said, no alliances allowed.

403
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,839
Rym: Type one a only.

404
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:15,320
Rym: And I remember that was like the best.

405
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,860
Rym: I still fucking lost the tournament.

406
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,519
Rym: Like you wouldn't believe.

407
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,840
Scott: Oh, I got completely hosed because I'd only ever played against my loser friends.

408
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,060
Scott: And you know, we didn't know the strategies or anything.

409
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:24,880
Scott: Despite buying books and magazines.

410
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,519
Rym: I knew the perfect deck and I probably could have won.

411
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,738
Rym: I couldn't afford it.

412
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,120
Rym: So I made some poison deck that relied heavily on getting certain cards early on.

413
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,411
Scott: Yep.

414
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,920
Scott: Anyway, so the World of Warcraft card game, right?

415
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,800
Scott: We didn't want to compare it to magic, but it's a game where you put down resource cards and then you summon monsters and then you attack.

416
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,739
Rym: It's every round.

417
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,460
Rym: You drop your resource cards.

418
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,718
Rym: You can put one down per turn.

419
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:54,600
Rym: You tap, I'm sorry, exhaust by rotating 90 degrees to the right.

420
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,720
Rym: And you then it's just colorless mana.

421
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:00,600
Rym: And creatures.

422
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,000
Rym: And the best part is the guy's like, it's not magic.

423
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,596
Rym: It's not magic.

424
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:06,300
Rym: But I'm like, all right, so I tapped this.

425
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,459
Rym: He's like, yeah, no, no, no.

426
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:08,199
Rym: You exhausted.

427
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:09,580
Rym: He catch himself.

428
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,920
Rym: And then finally I decided, all right, I'm going to get him.

429
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:14,059
Rym: I was like, all right.

430
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,960
Rym: So I played a creature and I was like, so I can't attack on the first round, right?

431
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:19,259
Rym: He's like, yeah, summoning sickness.

432
00:25:20,544 --> 00:25:21,980
Rym: And I was like, what's it called in this game?

433
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,440
Rym: He's like, oh, so I forget what he said.

434
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,014
Scott: Yeah.

435
00:25:25,744 --> 00:25:26,938
Rym: He was like, yeah, it's just magic.

436
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,399
Scott: But basically, all right.

437
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:42,260
Scott: The thing is, despite the game largely being the same as magic, like the World of Warcraft MMO, World of Warcraft is fundamentally the same as the muds that preceded it.

438
00:25:42,781 --> 00:25:44,960
Scott: Yet it was polished heavily.

439
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:52,320
Scott: All the annoyances that were on top of the fundamental flaws were washed away in the World of Warcraft.

440
00:25:52,700 --> 00:26:01,580
Scott: Now, the World of Warcraft card card game has all the fundamental flaws of Magic the Gathering and other similar collectible card games.

441
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:06,340
Scott: But all of the annoyances on top of those have been washed away.

442
00:26:07,122 --> 00:26:11,220
Rym: Now, I don't want to get into the long discussion of exactly why.

443
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:14,979
Rym: But, you know, people would argue like, oh, but magic is this magic is this.

444
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:17,080
Rym: And I guess we can take that to the forums.

445
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,020
Rym: I don't want to get into it, especially since this is our news bit.

446
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:27,960
Rym: Yeah, but playing the game, it was just magic, but they removed like some of the more annoying mechanics of magic.

447
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,360
Rym: Like the best example is resources.

448
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:31,319
Rym: Any round you can play a land.

449
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:34,380
Rym: Well, I guess they're quests and they have an extra little carrot dangle.

450
00:26:35,423 --> 00:26:38,100
Scott: I was thinking, why don't you just make a deck with no quest?

451
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,580
Scott: The quests are not as good as cards as non quest cards.

452
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:41,940
Scott: Right.

453
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,120
Scott: So just make a deck of all non quests and you can use any card as a land in quotes.

454
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,919
Rym: Well, the quest do get you things they do.

455
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,420
Scott: But I think the quests were not nearly as useful as actual cards.

456
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:53,584
Rym: Yeah.

457
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,420
Rym: Well, I mean, I guess we'd have to see more of the guy.

458
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,659
Scott: I don't know enough about all the cards available.

459
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,760
Rym: The game is pretty much one hundred percent deck building.

460
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:04,659
Rym: And the guy was like, no, it isn't.

461
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:06,140
Rym: And he showed us a strategy.

462
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,700
Rym: He's like, no, what if you want to any.

463
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:09,219
Scott: What if you bluffed?

464
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,007
Scott: And I'm like, oh, that would.

465
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:19,939
Rym: it's like, you know, he was like, I can attack him now for five damage or I could wait until I have a whole bunch of attacks and then attack him all at once for the one round kill.

466
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:21,360
Rym: And it's totally awesome.

467
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,119
Scott: And I was like, but wait, I can attack every turn and then the guy can defend even if he just attacked.

468
00:27:26,451 --> 00:27:26,598
Scott: Why?

469
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:30,760
Scott: Why would I ever not attack unless I was going to die from attacking?

470
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:34,040
Rym: And it just basically playing the game.

471
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:37,180
Rym: It was just this kind of simplified magic game.

472
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,960
Rym: It comes down to one hundred percent.

473
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:46,700
Rym: Well, I guess maybe 90 percent deck building and knowing what cards and knowing what cards the other person is going to play and kind of like a magic tournaments.

474
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,800
Rym: It was all about sideboard management and pregame tactics.

475
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,980
Rym: Well, pregame strategy.

476
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:55,280
Rym: Once you played, there were no tactical decisions at all.

477
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,980
Rym: There were only strategic decisions.

478
00:27:57,402 --> 00:28:00,360
Rym: But you just made all those decisions before you played.

479
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:02,351
Scott: It's basically right.

480
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:03,820
Scott: instead of rock, paper, scissors.

481
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,180
Scott: Imagine rock, paper, scissors.

482
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:05,560
Scott: Right.

483
00:28:05,902 --> 00:28:10,758
Scott: But instead of just rock, paper and scissor, you have like a thousand different things you can choose from.

484
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,480
Scott: Nuclear missile, nuclear missile defender.

485
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,420
Rym: So what you do, though, is you pick, you and your friend each pick a hundred of these secretly.

486
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,740
Rym: And then you pick another ten that you can swap in and out with.

487
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,260
Rym: Yep.

488
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,500
Rym: And then you play a game and then you're both allowed to swap in and out.

489
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,580
Rym: And then you play another game and then you're both allowed to swap in and out.

490
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,280
Rym: Then you play a third game and whoever wins two out of three wins.

491
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,899
Scott: It's just complicated rock, paper, scissor.

492
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:35,120
Scott: There was nothing to it.

493
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,420
Rym: We said we didn't want to compare this game to WOW either.

494
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,980
Rym: And same with the collectible game.

495
00:28:40,662 --> 00:28:48,899
Rym: But in both instances, the people who are demoing these games for us would basically every other sentence say it's exactly like WOW.

496
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,040
Rym: We have tried to recreate the WOW experience a hundred percent.

497
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:52,966
Rym: It is just.

498
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:54,440
Rym: it is WOW in cards.

499
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:55,599
Rym: It is WOW.

500
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,259
Rym: We are targeting WOW players.

501
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,257
Scott: Pretty much.

502
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,320
Scott: I mean, WOW has a lot of people and they're targeting collectors like specifically with the collectible game.

503
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,740
Rym: They were giving us straight up percentages of drop rates.

504
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,040
Rym: And they were like, yes, we really want it.

505
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,620
Rym: We expect people to collect every version and everything and collect, collect, collect.

506
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,860
Rym: And the primary focus is collecting.

507
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:17,660
Scott: Yep.

508
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,458
Scott: So screw that shit.

509
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,020
Rym: And they pretty much even said that they're going after the sunk cost.

510
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:31,060
Rym: I eventually got the miniatures people to say something to the effect of, well, yeah, the more they have, the more likely they are to keep buying more.

511
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,080
Rym: You're not going to just give up if you already own all these figures, right?

512
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:37,799
Rym: And I was like, wow, I couldn't have said it better myself.

513
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,105
Scott: Wow.

514
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:39,971
Scott: Yeah.

515
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,384
Scott: Wow.

516
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,143
Scott: Wow.

517
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:52,450
Rym: So speaking of WOW, I have talked about this before.

518
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:57,730
Rym: I'm going to make it my thing of the day only because I'm possibly going to do something epic.

519
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:00,469
Rym: But at the same time, I'm kind of afraid of doing this.

520
00:30:01,171 --> 00:30:07,430
Rym: But you see, the first MMO was Sierra's The Realm Online.

521
00:30:08,332 --> 00:30:10,289
Rym: And I've talked about it a few times.

522
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:16,046
Rym: How I played this game for longer than WOW it existed, though that is no longer true because WOW has been around a while now.

523
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:19,210
Rym: But let me put it, I'll put it to you straight.

524
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:31,780
Rym: Not only is The Realm still online, not only is the website still up, not only are the forums still active, not only are people still playing, but it's $70 a year and there's still a free trial.

525
00:30:36,254 --> 00:30:36,918
Scott: That's $70 a year.

526
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,068
Scott: isn't too bad compared to some other MMOs.

527
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,646
Rym: But what I'm thinking I want to do is remember this game had like 30,000 people in it.

528
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,148
Scott: See if your account is still in there.

529
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:52,090
Rym: Well, theoretically, I was given an account in perpetuity, but I'm sure it's not there anymore.

530
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,230
Rym: But what I could be, I think I don't even remember my password.

531
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:58,030
Scott: Fuck, if I saw the old email addresses.

532
00:30:58,575 --> 00:30:58,808
Rym: Yes.

533
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,243
Rym: Yes.

534
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,270
Rym: Elsendar@geocities.com.

535
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:02,899
Rym: Yeah.

536
00:31:03,476 --> 00:31:03,669
Rym: Yeah.

537
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:05,990
Scott: It could have been merged with the yahoo account.

538
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,850
Rym: A yahoo account that I don't have the password for anymore.

539
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:11,870
Scott: You get it recovered.

540
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:12,895
Rym: How?

541
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,729
Rym: It doesn't, I don't have an alternate email address in there.

542
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:18,066
Rym: My alternate email address was the geos80s one.

543
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:20,390
Scott: Because I didn't want, I hate yahoo.

544
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,450
Scott: There has to be a way.

545
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:22,830
Rym: I don't think there's a way.

546
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:23,610
Scott: Well, anyway.

547
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:32,506
Rym: Anyway, I think I'm going to make a free account and go in and see just what the fuck it's like in there.

548
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:38,428
Scott: Are you sure it's actually like, you know, still going or is it just like a website to the port just now?

549
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,468
Rym: And it was there.

550
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:41,550
Rym: All right.

551
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,010
Rym: It gave the same response that it gave when I was a kid.

552
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:45,808
Rym: All right.

553
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:47,607
Rym: So I'm going to find out.

554
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,130
Rym: I'm kind of afraid.

555
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:49,950
Scott: Okay.

556
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:54,130
Rym: I'm just going to link to the realm.

557
00:31:54,272 --> 00:31:55,270
Rym: You can look at some pictures.

558
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:00,210
Scott: Remember, this was the first MMO and didn't meridian 59 come a little earlier?

559
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,530
Rym: No, this game's a little bit later.

560
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,127
Rym: A little bit later.

561
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,142
Scott: They were similar in time because meridian 59, I didn't even hear know about the realm until you talked about it too.

562
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,670
Rym: It was garbage.

563
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,550
Scott: It was total trash garbage, like times a thousand.

564
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:21,389
Scott: Like when those games are coming out, basically all those games did was popularize muds because people are like, oh man, I'd like to play that kind of game.

565
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:23,349
Scott: Oh wait, they're charging a lot of money.

566
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,650
Scott: Oh, but wait, there's these text-based ones that are the same game, but they're free.

567
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,248
Scott: I'll do those.

568
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,949
Rym: See, but I remember at the same time there was one other game.

569
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:42,810
Rym: I actually, I think for Katie of all things was based on the same engine, but it was basically a text mud, but they kind of skinned it kind of like how there's that skin for dwarf or some people made like text muds, right?

570
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:53,268
Scott: But then they would clear a client application that would, you know, basically it was just a telnet, you know, program, but instead of showing you the actual text in the terminal, it would read the text.

571
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,690
Scott: The client would read the text and then render graphics based upon it.

572
00:32:57,012 --> 00:33:00,069
Scott: And then you would click buttons in the interface and it would send the text.

573
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:04,290
Scott: So it was just like a GUI on top of, you know, the existing telnet muds.

574
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,910
Scott: You can play the mud with the GUI or play the mud with the typing.

575
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,190
Rym: So the realm exists.

576
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:17,229
Rym: And I really, apparently according to Wikipedia, which I just looked up now, there's still like 200 people in there.

577
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:18,608
Rym: Oh, wow.

578
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,127
Rym: What are those people like?

579
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:23,489
Scott: I watch one of those people is someone who remembers you.

580
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,130
Rym: That would be kind of frightening.

581
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:34,288
Rym: I mean, if elemental flame or Lorianna or L minister are in there, because Elminster was taken by some other guy.

582
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,537
Rym: I still remember the night.

583
00:33:36,578 --> 00:33:48,029
Rym: it was sad, but when princess Diana died and I had a friend in the game whose name was princess die and he'd had that name for forever long before princess Diana died.

584
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:54,348
Rym: And I remember him saying in the public channel, man, I'm going to get so much undeserved shit for this.

585
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,894
Scott: That's like the guy who's playing Counter-Strike and his name was Osama bin Laden on September 10th.

586
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:03,647
Rym: And then, you know, having the name Osama bin Laden wasn't making any friends before that.

587
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,310
Scott: No, it wasn't.

588
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:04,914
Scott: But it was still.

589
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:07,110
Rym: besides you can change your name in Counter-Strike.

590
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:07,626
Scott: You can.

591
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:14,685
Rym: I used to play Counter-Strike with the troll in his names sometimes, but depends on the server.

592
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:15,909
Rym: It's not.

593
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:20,648
Rym: I mean, the realm, if I had my millions, it wasn't that easy to transfer my millions to someone else.

594
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:27,070
Rym: I basically have to go to like another account's house and dump it in the front yard and then change and hope that no one goes to the house and grabs it.

595
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:27,630
Rym: But anyway.

596
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,080
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:34:28,456 --> 00:34:28,670
Scott: Yeah.

598
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:34,449
Scott: Now that we have new computers, you want to, you know, I remember a long time ago we said we're going to do the the wow free trial.

599
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:36,289
Scott: It's moving up in the queue, I guess.

600
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:37,389
Rym: Yeah, I guess it is.

601
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:39,989
Scott: But at the same time, I don't imagine it taking more than like four hours.

602
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:45,149
Rym: I think we should play every modern deathmatch because there aren't many deathmatches left in the world.

603
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:45,809
Scott: Oh, definitely.

604
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:52,810
Rym: Even though I contend now I'm not going to back this up because I haven't played any deathmatch since Quake three.

605
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:58,010
Rym: And when I say deathmatch, I mean hardcore old school frags and Gibbs.

606
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,565
Rym: And that's it.

607
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:02,090
Scott: I played a quick for deathmatch once for a little bit.

608
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:02,609
Scott: It was all right.

609
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,070
Rym: I'm also talking PC only.

610
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:04,450
Rym: None of that.

611
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:05,227
Scott: Halo is PC.

612
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:12,130
Rym: Yeah, but like Halo ones on the PC only on the PC because it's kind of a different game.

613
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,470
Rym: otherwise for a lot of reasons.

614
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,910
Rym: But I contend I think I postulate.

615
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:30,370
Rym: I guess that lithium to deathmatch for the quick for Quake two was probably the most skill based and best overall FPS deathmatch ever made.

616
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,490
Scott: I think that's mostly your sentimental values.

617
00:35:32,752 --> 00:35:33,070
Rym: I don't know.

618
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:39,789
Rym: I think in terms of the cap on the skill, I think it had the highest cap, as in I don't think any human ever achieved the cap.

619
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:43,369
Rym: Maybe I know people achieve the the cap in Quake three.

620
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:46,210
Scott: And so my thing of the day here, right?

621
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:48,649
Scott: This is something everyone on the air has priority seen.

622
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:50,049
Scott: It's not really that new.

623
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,610
Scott: There's just a new YouTube video of it that got the links got passed around.

624
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,250
Scott: But this is like I hadn't seen it before, despite knowing it was old.

625
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,890
Scott: And this is like right up my alley of things that I think are awesome.

626
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,170
Scott: It's a robot.

627
00:36:04,691 --> 00:36:06,128
Scott: The robot is inside the box.

628
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,410
Scott: The box is actually, you could say, is part of the robot.

629
00:36:10,052 --> 00:36:11,869
Scott: There's a switch on the outside of the box.

630
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,088
Scott: You flick the switch.

631
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,170
Scott: The box opens and the robot will.

632
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:22,330
Scott: Well, the robot is the box, but the robot will flick the switch in the other direction and then it will close itself.

633
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:34,548
Rym: I will point out, I remember very clearly that in it not gotten not in the realm in Quest for Glory, you go into this bad place at one point with dangerous wizard stuff all around.

634
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:41,970
Rym: And there's a box with a big lever and you pull the lever and this hairy ass arm comes out and pulls the lever to make the door close.

635
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,988
Rym: It's exactly like your little box.

636
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:44,670
Scott: Awesome.

637
00:36:45,332 --> 00:36:46,028
Scott: I like this box.

638
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,419
Rym: So this won't take long tonight.

639
00:36:49,022 --> 00:36:50,430
Rym: talking about Risk.

640
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,030
Scott: Yes, it is a game that is very famous.

641
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,350
Scott: It's like a war game.

642
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,829
Scott: I guess it is a war game, even though I sort of don't want to dignify it in any way.

643
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:10,930
Rym: Risk is a almost completely random game that for some reason Americans have this fixation on kind of like monopoly or sorry or like headache.

644
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,210
Scott: Yeah, it has like this place, problematic trouble.

645
00:37:14,661 --> 00:37:14,766
Scott: Yeah.

646
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,290
Scott: It has like this place in people's mind.

647
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,828
Scott: Like people know what Risk is.

648
00:37:19,192 --> 00:37:21,050
Scott: Like a lot of people have played it.

649
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,670
Scott: It's popular.

650
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:27,278
Scott: It's on the shelves in anywhere that board games are sold, unlike, say, Settlers of Catan, which is not on the shelves.

651
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:28,810
Scott: anywhere board games are sold.

652
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:30,910
Scott: And, you know, it's taken.

653
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:32,970
Scott: Uh, it is a place in pop culture.

654
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:37,110
Scott: Had the Seinfeld episode where the Ukraine is weak, very famous, very funny.

655
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:38,050
Scott: All right.

656
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:44,470
Scott: But Risk as a game is really not good at all.

657
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,570
Scott: It's a complete waste of time.

658
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,050
Rym: I mean, it can be fun if you have like a Risk party or everyone's really into it.

659
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:56,126
Scott: Even when we had a Risk party, that's sort of like when I finally realized that wasn't fun.

660
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,789
Rym: See, the Risk party was fun.

661
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,970
Rym: The main reason it was fun is there was like the full on extended front row crew.

662
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:14,728
Rym: And we had three simultaneous games of Risk going in the same room, and it was pretty much just a giant, crazy loud socializing party that happened to have a Risk in the center of it.

663
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:15,150
Scott: Yeah.

664
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:15,706
Scott: The Risk.

665
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:17,230
Scott: And it's a funny thing.

666
00:38:17,351 --> 00:38:18,710
Scott: It's like when I was a kid, right?

667
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:21,330
Scott: Like I didn't know about the real quality game.

668
00:38:21,452 --> 00:38:22,269
Scott: So I was like, Risk.

669
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,623
Scott: Oh yeah.

670
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:23,369
Scott: Real game.

671
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:23,889
Rym: All right.

672
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:29,890
Rym: See, I guess as a kid, I knew better because even I'd play Risk with my family and I, the whole time it'd be like, this is random bullshit.

673
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:31,030
Rym: That was bullshit.

674
00:38:31,252 --> 00:38:32,850
Rym: This game's just random bullshit.

675
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,309
Rym: We might as well just flip a coin.

676
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,709
Scott: So my family wouldn't play with me.

677
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:39,526
Scott: I had to play, I could play with my brother and sometimes I could play with friends coming over.

678
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:47,210
Scott: But, you know, basically it's like the game, like I liked it as a kid because I liked moving things around.

679
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,710
Scott: I like playing with little soldiers and moving around a map.

680
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,370
Scott: And, you know, I liked rolling dice, you know?

681
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:56,489
Scott: But the game itself like didn't bother me at that young age.

682
00:38:57,111 --> 00:39:06,029
Scott: And later on, you know, it's like every time we would play, like someone would just give up and quit or someone would like flip the board over, you know, it was getting really stupid and annoying.

683
00:39:06,631 --> 00:39:13,015
Scott: And I felt like it was sort of weird because I didn't get, I didn't, I like, I blamed the people I was playing with.

684
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:18,850
Scott: instead of blaming the game, you know, because like I was sort of having fun moving the pieces around.

685
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:24,950
Scott: It's like when the game was sort of crumble apart before actually finishing, I'd be like, ah, it's you.

686
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,710
Scott: Why didn't you go through on the game?

687
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:27,168
Scott: You suck.

688
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:27,435
Scott: Blah.

689
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:32,750
Scott: And it was, you know, but it took a while to realize, oh, the game sucks.

690
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:33,847
Scott: That's why.

691
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:42,630
Rym: So if you like Risk and you don't play German board games, play German board games, at least play Axes and Allies, which is marginally better.

692
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,450
Rym: At least play.

693
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:49,610
Scott: I mean, you're even better off playing an actual miniatures game like Warhammer or Battle Tech or one of those.

694
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,950
Rym: Or even Castle Risk.

695
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:52,550
Scott: Castle Risk is bad.

696
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,449
Rym: Wasn't that bad.

697
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,143
Rym: It's better than Risk.

698
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,030
Scott: It is better than Risk, but that's not saying much.

699
00:39:57,391 --> 00:40:02,690
Rym: It's like saying it smells better than poop, but God risk is just, I can say one thing.

700
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,009
Rym: Australia guarantees you the solid second place.

701
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:07,845
Scott: I guess it does.

702
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:09,690
Rym: Yes, it does.

703
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:11,367
Scott: I don't know.

704
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:13,310
Rym: Just playing Risk is just not fun.

705
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,530
Rym: And I'll tell you all one thing.

706
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:25,130
Rym: And I think I said this before and some people in the forums, one guy emailed me and he was like, Rym, I did what you said and I went at risk a lot now and pretty much always be on the offensive.

707
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:32,749
Rym: If you're on the offensive and you outnumber your opponent about three to two, you will always win in aggregates.

708
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:33,570
Scott: Yeah.

709
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:38,370
Scott: And you might lose a battle here and there, but you're going to win most of the time.

710
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:48,007
Scott: And if you just keep battling everywhere, you know, if you start 10 battles a turn and you win six of them, you know, you're going to pretty much be equally powerful as the other guy.

711
00:40:48,452 --> 00:40:51,629
Scott: And you're going to gain six territories and, you know, lose three.

712
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:56,507
Scott: You're going to be up and you do it again the next turn to be up again and you'll get more than him.

713
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,169
Scott: And then momentum sets in and you win.

714
00:40:58,855 --> 00:40:59,770
Scott: And that's the game.

715
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,072
Scott: It just.

716
00:41:00,556 --> 00:41:02,190
Scott: I think the problems with risk are this.

717
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:09,429
Rym: Number one, there's a lot of randomness going on, but that seems to be a trend in almost every American style board game ever made.

718
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:09,723
Rym: Yep.

719
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:13,990
Scott: Number two, the cards really kind of dumb, really.

720
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:19,950
Rym: I remember playing a problematic trouble, which was I don't know how popular it is among families nowadays.

721
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,069
Rym: But when I was a kid, I saw some people playing travel trouble at the laundromat.

722
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:26,498
Rym: Uh, that game was like the.

723
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:36,769
Rym: I mean, I played a lot of board games as a kid with my family and I'd always get into arguments because I would always contend that every game we owned was completely random and there was no point in playing them.

724
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:37,450
Rym: Yeah.

725
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:38,530
Scott: I mean, trouble.

726
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,430
Rym: And they'd always say, no, you're just a sore loser.

727
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,810
Scott: Trouble was fun because of the problematic part.

728
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:45,970
Scott: Other than that, it was just roll, move, roll, move, roll, move.

729
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,290
Rym: It was just Candyland, basically, basically.

730
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,010
Scott: It's saying Uncle Wiggly even.

731
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,610
Rym: Oh God, Uncle Wiggly.

732
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,970
Scott: Even worse than Candyland.

733
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,110
Rym: We have like an old 1930 something version of Uncle Wiggly.

734
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:56,969
Scott: That's pretty good.

735
00:41:57,633 --> 00:41:58,390
Scott: I like Uncle Wiggly.

736
00:41:58,651 --> 00:41:59,250
Scott: I like Candyland.

737
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,108
Scott: I just don't like the games.

738
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,048
Scott: I like the theme.

739
00:42:01,511 --> 00:42:02,210
Rym: Chutes and Ladders.

740
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,470
Scott: Chutes and Ladders, same game.

741
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,530
Rym: Actually, there was one good game.

742
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,370
Rym: It was called Payday and it was kind of manager money.

743
00:42:07,711 --> 00:42:08,690
Scott: Other people had that game.

744
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,990
Scott: I didn't, but I seen it around.

745
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,569
Rym: It was better than most of those games.

746
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,170
Scott: Careers was a better version.

747
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:13,439
Scott: Yeah.

748
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,609
Rym: The worst game was Life.

749
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,407
Scott: Life, yeah.

750
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,829
Scott: Careers is basically life, but sucks less.

751
00:42:19,274 --> 00:42:20,510
Scott: I have careers in the closet.

752
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,090
Scott: We could play it.

753
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:31,090
Rym: I would recommend that if you ever have the urge to play Risk ever again, just hit yourself on the arm with a newspaper and say nope, and then go buy like Illuminati or something and play that.

754
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:33,809
Rym: It's just as tedious, but at least it's more fun.

755
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:39,110
Scott: The thing that I think is the biggest problem with Risk is that it takes too long for what you get.

756
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,790
Scott: I mean, look at a game like Shogun, say, or Samurai Sword.

757
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,010
Scott: That game is awesome.

758
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:46,950
Rym: And no, if you want to play Risk, play Shogun instead.

759
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:47,369
Scott: Yes.

760
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,990
Scott: Well, Samurai Sword is formerly known as Shogun, right?

761
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:54,410
Scott: Because there's other games named Shogun that are not Samurai Sword.

762
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,609
Rym: In fact, there's two other games named Shogun that I know of.

763
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,989
Scott: We're talking Milton Bradley's Game Master series, Shogun/Samurai Sword.

764
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:00,983
Rym: The one for your old D12.

765
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,109
Scott: It comes in a box that looks a lot like the Axis and Allies boxes in the same set.

766
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:07,170
Scott: All right.

767
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:11,250
Scott: So in that game, there's a lot of different stuff going on.

768
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,850
Scott: You got the, you got the, the Goku management.

769
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:14,870
Scott: You got the Ninja.

770
00:43:15,294 --> 00:43:16,263
Scott: You got the Ronin.

771
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,750
Scott: You got the castles, right?

772
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,729
Scott: There's all sorts of different things that spice the game up.

773
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,050
Scott: In Risk, it's just how many units do you have?

774
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:26,308
Scott: Where are they?

775
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:27,730
Scott: That's it.

776
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:30,010
Scott: It's a number and a spot.

777
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:35,190
Scott: It couldn't be more bland with just nothing to think about, nothing to do.

778
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,790
Scott: It's just my number is bigger than yours and it's next to yours.

779
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:39,541
Scott: Attack.

780
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,570
Scott: And like, you can just move all your guys through your own territory infinitely, right?

781
00:43:45,017 --> 00:43:45,548
Scott: If I remember.

782
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:47,610
Rym: Not fully.

783
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:48,688
Scott: I pretty much.

784
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:57,089
Scott: And basically I remember I would just have you basically move all your guys to the border territories and all your inner territories would be pretty much empty.

785
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:05,050
Scott: That was just like, so all it was was just, okay, I put all most my guys next to most of your guys.

786
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,629
Scott: Then we roll the dice a whole bunch and see who wins.

787
00:44:07,991 --> 00:44:11,610
Scott: And maybe once in a blue moon, the guy with less guys would hold out.

788
00:44:12,173 --> 00:44:14,689
Scott: One unit would somehow destroy like Dan and it would be crazy.

789
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:24,190
Rym: When a player has finished attacking, he or she has the option to move any number of armies from one and only one of their territories in adjacent territory that occupy.

790
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,129
Rym: And then there's the whole fortifying after the fact stuff too.

791
00:44:28,037 --> 00:44:28,530
Rym: Doesn't matter.

792
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,370
Rym: Risk is not worth playing ever again.

793
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:31,910
Rym: Pretty much.

794
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,767
Rym: Don't bother with it.

795
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:34,870
Scott: And it's famous.

796
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,350
Scott: I don't know why it's famous.

797
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,108
Scott: It just is.

798
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:59,030
Scott: I get the feeling it's weird because in other mediums of, you know, art creation, right, things which have become famous, you know, it might not always be the most, you know, artistically wonderful and perfect things that get the most famous, you know, but the things that do get famous have some sort of merit, you know, like really famous movies.

799
00:44:59,271 --> 00:45:02,230
Scott: You don't see really terrible movies becoming really popular.

800
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:14,666
Scott: I mean, you might see like a summer blockbuster getting really popular, but it's not going to be like some horrendously bad one that like people are like barfing when they watch or like it's so painful, you know, they just, you know, they might be average.

801
00:45:14,726 --> 00:45:20,190
Scott: or, you know, the really popular video games, you know, the halos, the maddens, the GTAs, right?

802
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:21,710
Scott: They're not that bad.

803
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,822
Scott: I mean, they're no, they're no

804
00:45:23,963 --> 00:45:24,405
Scott: E.T.,

805
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:24,908
Scott: right?

806
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,297
Scott: But in board games, at least in the

807
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:28,858
Scott: U.S.,

808
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:32,639
Scott: the really popular ones are the really terrible ones.

809
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,549
Scott: They're just so bad.

810
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:41,410
Rym: I don't know what it is, but what is the mac and the ridiculous obsession with bad games?

811
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,150
Scott: Monopoly, so bad.

812
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,210
Scott: Risk, so bad.

813
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:46,989
Rym: I guess, you know, here's this might be the illuminating point.

814
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:48,550
Scott: Scrabble is not so bad.

815
00:45:48,892 --> 00:45:49,429
Rym: Scrabble is pretty bad.

816
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:50,610
Scott: No, it's not that bad.

817
00:45:50,893 --> 00:45:51,110
Scott: It's not.

818
00:45:51,572 --> 00:45:52,050
Rym: Their worst game.

819
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,330
Scott: Stratego is not so bad either.

820
00:45:53,711 --> 00:46:00,710
Rym: But I want to, I point out that if you play Monopoly according to the rules, it's not nearly as bad of a game.

821
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,070
Rym: It's just incredibly unfun.

822
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,450
Rym: It's not that unfun.

823
00:46:03,532 --> 00:46:04,082
Rym: It's pretty unfun.

824
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,050
Rym: What I'm saying, though, you're missing the point.

825
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:12,600
Rym: The default game, Monopoly, as it is in the rule book originally is not that bad of a game.

826
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,790
Scott: It's not that bad.

827
00:46:14,618 --> 00:46:15,170
Rym: Let me finish.

828
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:15,565
Rym: Good guy.

829
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:27,990
Rym: But every American I've ever met who plays Monopoly, they all play with the same set of house rules to the point that everyone in America thinks these are the rules, even though they're not written in any rule book ever.

830
00:46:28,592 --> 00:46:34,090
Rym: And all these rules serve to do is make the game like four times more random.

831
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:37,829
Rym: It's like they try to remove skill from games and make it more fair.

832
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:39,669
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

833
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:50,029
Scott: I think the reason, though, people do that in Monopoly is because if you play Monopoly by the rules, the real way it's supposed to be played, it's very painful and unfun.

834
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:52,670
Rym: because really, it's not any less painful.

835
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:53,270
Rym: It does.

836
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:58,009
Scott: If you suck because you basically have not so much money, you can't just buy everything you land on.

837
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:03,326
Scott: You know, you have to actually think about things and do things like what are the original rules?

838
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,370
Scott: Well, it's different.

839
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,009
Scott: Someone lands on a property like you auction it off.

840
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:08,510
Scott: No, no, no.

841
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,689
Rym: If you land on a property, you have the right to buy it.

842
00:47:11,112 --> 00:47:13,288
Rym: If you don't buy it, then it is auctioned.

843
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:15,288
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:17,169
Rym: You have the right to buy it, though.

845
00:47:17,432 --> 00:47:18,870
Rym: It doesn't just automatically go to auction.

846
00:47:19,491 --> 00:47:20,817
Scott: Yeah, but you like.

847
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:27,429
Scott: I remember I played a DOS version that sort of had the auctioning, but you could actually opt not to auction, which is not an option in the real rules.

848
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:30,669
Scott: You have to auction it if you don't buy it anyway.

849
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:35,987
Scott: The point is, if you play Monopoly by the real rules, it's it's not.

850
00:47:36,128 --> 00:47:39,810
Scott: you know, people like to have lots of money and they like to just buy everything they land on.

851
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,190
Scott: I'd like to collect the little properties and move the guy around the board.

852
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:51,849
Scott: And by modifying the rules, by putting lots of money in the middle and getting it when you land on free parking and stuff like that, it makes the game like you're getting more stuff and you go.

853
00:47:52,513 --> 00:47:53,189
Rym: Well, that's just it.

854
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:58,989
Rym: Seems like a lot of people really don't like games of skill and they want to play games that are effectively just pretty colors.

855
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:02,789
Scott: They just want to collect lots of thingies and feel good about collecting lots of thingies.

856
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,550
Rym: Oh, well, we might get some hate from the fact that we're hating on risk.

857
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:06,990
Rym: You know what?

858
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,330
Rym: Risk is a terrible game.

859
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:09,268
Scott: And you know what?

860
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,635
Scott: I feel like this whole show.

861
00:48:10,796 --> 00:48:11,097
Scott: really.

862
00:48:11,218 --> 00:48:17,650
Scott: I mean, it could it's it's it's technically the risk show, but really it's just the bitch about bad games.

863
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:22,029
Scott: I mean, they bitched about the world card game sucking some more.

864
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:25,329
Scott: They bitched about, you know, the sucky risk.

865
00:48:26,151 --> 00:48:27,990
Scott: I sort of Rondo of Swords wasn't that bad.

866
00:48:28,235 --> 00:48:28,968
Scott: It's a good it's OK.

867
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,649
Scott: Puzzle game.

868
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,110
Rym: I mentioned Advanced Wars and I like it a lot.

869
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:32,608
Rym: I guess.

870
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:32,941
Scott: Yeah.

871
00:48:33,672 --> 00:48:35,289
Rym: Man, want to play Advanced Wars right now?

872
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:37,349
Scott: No, we got to play other games.

873
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,127
Rym: Now we don't.

874
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:39,529
Scott: We got Mario Kart and such.

875
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,597
Rym: Yeah, we played.

876
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:42,090
Rym: we played a few races in Mario Kart.

877
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,784
Rym: All I have to say, it's really fun, except when the A.I.

878
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:50,109
Rym: is around because there's so many items that it's just it's not worth playing to figure out how to turn the A.I.

879
00:48:50,481 --> 00:48:50,609
Scott: off.

880
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,600
Scott: And if that's not possible, it's gonna be very annoying.

881
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:56,050
Rym: if I'm sure there's a way we played the game for like 10 minutes.

882
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,710
Rym: But if there is no way to turn off all those extra A.I.

883
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,870
Rym: players, I'm done with Mario Kart already.

884
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,470
Scott: I know that's not the case, but yeah, we'll probably play it when people come over.

885
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:08,147
Scott: But it's, you know, yeah.

886
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:08,949
Rym: Yeah.

887
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,870
Rym: Plus, people said, oh, they took out snaking completely.

888
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:19,010
Rym: But I discovered already that if I pick a car with the worst handling I can, I can totally gold spark on straight away.

889
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:23,930
Scott: You can, but it's not snaking because you're not like having to hurt your hand by wiggling back and forth.

890
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,330
Rym: Yeah, but it's the same kind of gaming.

891
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:26,602
Rym: It's just not quite as bad.

892
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:31,856
Scott: But you can tell the problem I had with the snaking was not the boosting on the straight away, but the fact that you had to.

893
00:49:31,896 --> 00:49:36,009
Scott: basically the way to win the game was by shaking your hand furiously back and forth.

894
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,970
Rym: Well, all you had to do really was don't shake your hand.

895
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:43,269
Scott: Shake the D.S Well, so a game that you win, that's basically the shaking game, not fun.

896
00:49:43,611 --> 00:49:49,830
Scott: Yeah, if it's if it's, you know, sort of a slow, actual doable control, then it's that is acceptable.

897
00:49:50,136 --> 00:49:50,690
Rym: You know, it's funny.

898
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,450
Rym: I thought, oh, I have a bunch of risk anecdotes.

899
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:57,928
Rym: But when I think back, I have a couple of castle risk anecdotes, but I don't want to talk about castle risk.

900
00:49:58,131 --> 00:49:58,881
Rym: Yeah, that game.

901
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,150
Scott: You probably I barely remember castle.

902
00:50:01,351 --> 00:50:01,806
Rym: I owned it.

903
00:50:02,053 --> 00:50:02,628
Scott: Yeah, you did.

904
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:06,290
Rym: The only anecdotes I have are either.

905
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:13,609
Rym: Yeah, we had this risk party one time and every other one ends with, yeah, everyone got pissed at each other and quit playing after about an hour.

906
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:19,550
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much all my risk things where you cheated or the game is bullshit.

907
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,127
Scott: I give up.

908
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,138
Scott: There's nothing I can do.

909
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,390
Scott: or this isn't fun anymore.

910
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,590
Scott: It's been going on too long or, you know, no one.

911
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,770
Scott: You know, it's like no one ever finishes that game or finishes Monopoly either.

912
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:29,582
Scott: What does that tell you?

913
00:50:30,915 --> 00:50:31,688
Scott: What does that tell you?

914
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:36,610
Rym: You know, I'm liking more and more because we bought a couple of games over the weekend and well, last weekend.

915
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,148
Scott: Yeah, we'll talk.

916
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,150
Scott: We bought diplomacy and I bought through the ages.

917
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:43,030
Rym: Both of these games have something that other games don't have.

918
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:50,450
Rym: They have a way for a player to quit that doesn't just end the game and break everything, Like, because, you know, let's say you're playing Monopoly and you say, I quit.

919
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:54,790
Scott: Well, there's no rules in the game for quitting and it sort of ruins the game if someone quits.

920
00:50:54,871 --> 00:50:56,530
Scott: because now what do you do with their money?

921
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,530
Scott: What do you do with their property?

922
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:02,268
Rym: It doesn't so much in Monopoly, but there are other games where it totally ruined like settlers.

923
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:03,248
Rym: What now?

924
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,249
Scott: Yeah, right.

925
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,710
Scott: If someone quits in the middle of the game, it just ruins the game.

926
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:14,309
Scott: But these games actually have built in rules diplomacy and through the ages and say, if someone wants to quit, this is what you do.

927
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:18,090
Scott: And it's actually, oh, now, you know, that's that's really good.

928
00:51:18,151 --> 00:51:18,606
Scott: I like that.

929
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:24,509
Scott: I like especially for long games, you know, a way for someone to quit that doesn't break the game for the remaining players.

930
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:25,469
Scott: That's awesome.

931
00:51:32,193 --> 00:51:34,270
