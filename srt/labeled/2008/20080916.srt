1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,561
Scott: It's Tuesday, September 16th.

2
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:12,362
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:13,042
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:14,663
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:18,465
Scott: Tonight, PAX08 Part Deux.

6
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:19,746
Scott: Saturday.

7
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:26,890
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,872
Rym: Once again, it's a Tuesday night, and once again, we're talking about PAX.

9
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:47,540
Rym: What we would have done the previous week if I had not been ill, and what we would have done, I guess, right after PAX, if it weren't for the fact that it took us more than an hour just to talk about Friday at PAX.

10
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:56,160
Rym: Uh, it's just, we're not gonna do news, we're not, well, we're gonna do things of the day, but I think we really have to just get right into this.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:05,280
Rym: All I want to say is that if we were doing news, I would talk about the crazy DRM in Spore, but we're not doing a news, so I'm not gonna talk about it.

12
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:16,040
Rym: We were talking about Saturday at the Penny Arcade Expo 2008.

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:22,655
Scott: So someone in our forum posted this really cool link to TIGsource.com, which is the independent gaming source.

14
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:25,180
Scott: If you like independent gaming, it's a site you should follow.

15
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,840
Scott: Anyway, they had a competition, the Bootleg Demakes Competition.

16
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,017
Rym: Demake?

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:40,840
Scott: Yeah, basically the idea of this competition was that you made a video game, and the video game you made was a demake of an existing game.

18
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,820
Scott: As, you know, normally, I mean, games these days get lots and lots of remakes and sequels, right, you know?

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,325
Scott: But this is a demake.

20
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:50,860
Scott: Take a game and make a shittier version of it.

21
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:59,600
Scott: So, like, the example they give sort of on the side is an Atari cartridge that says "Cogs of Conflict" instead of Gears of War.

22
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:06,300
Scott: Alright, so it's like, what if the new shiny game Gears of War was an old bootleg Atari game because of conflict, right?

23
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:12,360
Scott: You can download this torrent that has all the games in it, absolutely every one of them.

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,580
Scott: You need Windows for the vast majority of them.

25
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,773
Rym: Before any of you think, "Why would I want to download a bunch of joke and stupid

26
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:19,134
Rym: games?"

27
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:20,400
Rym: I'm gonna say one thing.

28
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:23,200
Rym: A lot of those games are actually really fun.

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,300
Scott: A lot of these are actually better than a lot of games that you pay for.

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,460
Scott: Alright, I mean, there's a game, it's like actually a real RTS, like, for reals.

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Scott: You know, some of them are just jokes like "Auntie Falcon's Amateur Rollerboarder 5", which is a Tony Hawk, you know, parody and such.

32
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,420
Scott: But, like, "Advanced Set the Rope on Fire Cartridge" is better than "Set the Rope on Fire".

33
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:49,792
Rym: Well, it better be.

34
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:50,217
Rym: It's advanced.

35
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,656
Scott: "Buddy Bass 2" is a 2D Team Fortress 2.

36
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:55,700
Scott: It's actually really good.

37
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,505
Scott: "Corner's Shiny", right?

38
00:02:57,826 --> 00:02:59,029
Scott: "Mirror's Edge" isn't even out yet.

39
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,680
Scott: They made "Corner's Shiny", which is basically 2D "Mirror's Edge".

40
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:08,900
Scott: But it's actually, like, a really good platforming, sort of "Ninja Guy" Danish kind of thing.

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,485
Rym: I mean, the way I would look at these is, remember "Passage"?

42
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:18,660
Rym: We talked a lot about it and how, you know, there's games that exist that kind of blur the line between, I guess, game versus art.

43
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,279
Rym: You know, a game that is not just a game or a test of skill.

44
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,720
Scott: Well, any game is art, you know.

45
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,180
Scott: It's like any movie is art, even a really bad one.

46
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:35,360
Rym: Games are primarily either tests of a skill or idle enjoyments, but then there are games... It's kind of like the difference between a film and a movie or a book and literature.

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:48,414
Scott: It's basically someone made a piece of interactive software for the purposes of artistic expression, you know, as their intent, rather than, you know, entertainment or occupying the brain or anything like that.

48
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:55,625
Scott: Yeah.

49
00:03:55,825 --> 00:04:01,499
Scott: My favorite one is, you only have to see the screenshot to get the joke, "General Sherman's Redemption".

50
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,079
Scott: Did you see the screenshot for it?

51
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:04,382
Scott: Yes.

52
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:05,739
Rym: Oh, good God, yes.

53
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,441
Scott: All right.

54
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:14,020
Scott: So, yeah, you definitely, if you have a Windows computer or even if you don't even have Windows, right, just go to the website and look at all the screenshots and the game titles.

55
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:19,399
Scott: And it's funny, if you actually have Windows, download the torrent and play as many of these as you can.

56
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:26,336
Scott: Some of them only take like a minute, but some of them are actually, you might keep playing for a long... Some of them have working, good multiplayer.

57
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:28,019
Scott: Good God.

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,300
Scott: All right.

59
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:43,620
Rym: So, Emily turned me on to this, but you know, Japan will have their kind of memes where they'll do something like the caramel dance and where someone did something and then a million people will take like that thing, but replace all the characters in it with characters from something else.

60
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:48,430
Rym: This time, it's something really long.

61
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:53,020
Rym: They took this song, this kind of comedic song about going to the convenience store late at night.

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,760
Rym: And they basically will take this and take characters from something like you do and put them in it.

63
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,805
Rym: And all I want to say is, one, this video is hilarious.

64
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:05,909
Rym: Two, it has subtitles.

65
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:11,460
Rym: You can actually understand what the song is, which of course, it really doesn't make sense if you can't understand Japanese otherwise.

66
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:13,963
Rym: I don't know what I can say.

67
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:15,065
Rym: I find this hilarious.

68
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:21,037
Rym: This is one of the better, weird memes that come out of Japan lately, even though I'm surprised because it's really long.

69
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:22,620
Rym: The song is like three and a half minutes long.

70
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,847
Rym: It's not like caramel dance, which is just 12 frames of animation.

71
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:26,669
Scott: Yeah.

72
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:30,197
Scott: I mean, this is, they took a song, you know, in the US we have songs like this.

73
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:31,600
Scott: There's songs that tell a story.

74
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,244
Rym: Like the Chainsaw Juggler.

75
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:34,126
Scott: Like Chainsaw Juggler.

76
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:35,850
Rym: You know, whatever happened to the Chainsaw Juggler.

77
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,694
Scott: Or some weird Al songs.

78
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,037
Scott: You know, any kind of Dr.

79
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,140
Scott: Demento kind of fair.

80
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,867
Scott: And there's a song from Japan that's up that alley.

81
00:05:43,887 --> 00:05:45,251
Scott: You know, if there was a Japanese Dr.

82
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,574
Scott: Demento, he'd play that song.

83
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:48,979
Scott: And I wonder if there is a Japanese Dr.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,160
Scott: Demento.

85
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:57,800
Rym: I'm sure there is, but it's, one, of all the ones, I'm linking to this on a Tuesday because, one, the anime people probably have already seen this.

86
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,604
Rym: You know, the Wednesday GeekNights listeners.

87
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:02,951
Rym: But two, they happen to take characters from Smash Brothers.

88
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,635
Rym: It's two link goes to the convenience store.

89
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,000
Rym: And I got to say, to the convenience store.

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,284
Rym: It fits really well.

91
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:10,686
Rym: It's pretty well done.

92
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:16,075
Rym: I'm not actually going to play the audio in the show for one reason, one reason alone.

93
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:17,578
Rym: It'll get stuck in your head.

94
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:18,920
Rym: It's been stuck in my head for like a week.

95
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,743
Scott: And we don't have time.

96
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:21,228
Rym: It's trivial to do that.

97
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:23,297
Rym: It's just, it'll get stuck in your head.

98
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,120
Rym: I'm going to warn you now.

99
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:25,818
Scott: Alright, let's PAX it up.

100
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,611
Rym: So, I can't believe, you know, Friday, all that happened.

101
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:34,480
Rym: We had more coverage for Friday at PAX than we've had about, I don't know, most conventions we go to.

102
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,924
Scott: And started at 2 o'clock.

103
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:41,740
Scott: There are conventions we go to at 8am on Friday that have less to say than we had to say about Friday at PAX.

104
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,184
Rym: Saturday, we wake up.

105
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:47,533
Rym: And, much like Friday, we had plenty of time.

106
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:49,699
Rym: The con didn't start until 10am.

107
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:54,969
Scott: I mean, you know, 2pm on Friday is pretty late, you know.

108
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:58,455
Scott: 10am on Saturday.

109
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:01,260
Scott: That's earlier than 2, a lot earlier, you know.

110
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,600
Rym: But still, cons we go to, the hotel cons, they usually have stuff starting at like 8 o'clock on Saturday.

111
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,417
Scott: Otakon opens at 7 or 8, right?

112
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:10,665
Rym: Uh, 9.

113
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:11,859
Scott: Even so, that's pretty, you know.

114
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,565
Rym: It's weird, all that extra hours.

115
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:17,560
Rym: Like, everything about PAX is just a little bit off from what I'm used to.

116
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,571
Rym: Most cons I go to, like PAX is just crooked slightly so.

117
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:22,880
Rym: Yeah, we open at 10, I know everyone else opens at 9.

118
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,640
Scott: By opening at 10, it's like they give you all this time to eat breakfast, and get your shit together, and hang out, and talk, and not do anything.

119
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:33,553
Scott: It's really weird.

120
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:34,300
Scott: But it was nice.

121
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:43,240
Rym: Now, actually Saturday, we spent probably the first time we actually had a chance to really just kinda wander around the con without any goal in mind.

122
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,206
Rym: I mean, there was no event.

123
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,851
Rym: at 10 we wanted to go to.

124
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:49,480
Rym: We just woke up, wandered over the con, and walked around.

125
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,993
Scott: Well, there actually was the, um, make a strip panel.

126
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,699
Scott: But we didn't make it to make a strip panel.

127
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,788
Rym: Basically, we said, well, we'll see.

128
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,520
Rym: We haven't had to line up for anything really yet to go in.

129
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,064
Rym: So, let's see about this.

130
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:01,606
Rym: make a strip.

131
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:06,120
Rym: And let me tell you, the line for the make a strip was frightening.

132
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,980
Rym: It was perhaps the most painful line in the entire convention.

133
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,660
Scott: Yeah, I mean, at the anime conventions, right, the masquerade gets this huge line and fills up the main events.

134
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,020
Scott: At, you know, PAX, they had main events filling events in main events, pretty much the whole con.

135
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,448
Scott: And that was everything most people wanted to do.

136
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:28,280
Scott: You wanted to go see the Q&As, you wanted to see the keynote, you wanted to see the concerts.

137
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:31,930
Scott: You know, you wanted to see the make a strip panel, all main events.

138
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:34,857
Scott: Every day there were at least two main events to go.

139
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,320
Scott: see, right?

140
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:38,567
Rym: But the make a strip just kind of transcended that.

141
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:42,780
Rym: I mean, I expected long lines, and we got into the concerts, you know, by the skin of our teeth.

142
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,836
Rym: And we really didn't have to wait in any lines, but there was no way to get into that make a strip for us.

143
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:50,140
Rym: There was just no way.

144
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,256
Scott: I figure I went to all the main events I wanted to go to, except for the make a strip.

145
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:55,320
Scott: I made out pretty well.

146
00:08:56,261 --> 00:09:01,660
Scott: I was expecting, I was thinking I was going to be lucky going to one of them because of the insane lines required.

147
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:04,159
Scott: But I went to all of them but once, that's pretty good.

148
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,486
Rym: Yep, so pretty much we just kind of wandered around the con.

149
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:19,120
Rym: Now the thing that was really kind of cool was that because the convention center is really tall, there was basically this kind of long, upward angled throughfare where you'd go up escalator, escalator, escalator to all these different levels.

150
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,000
Rym: And then around on the corner on the other side there was the same thing kind of going back down.

151
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,100
Scott: Yeah, there was like a north lobby, there was like a north end of the convention center and a south end, and they were almost separate convention centers.

152
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:35,280
Scott: Like, to get from one to the other was like woooo, and then it started like the dark world and the light world almost.

153
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:40,700
Scott: And each side had a tower of escalators going up and down on multiple floors.

154
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:49,460
Rym: And this is really why I think why so many people could be at PAX and yet it didn't feel nearly as crowded as like Katsucon or Otakon or even ConnectiCon.

155
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:57,280
Rym: Well, Saturday, ConnectiCon, is that there was so much space associated with the con that just happened to be there.

156
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,251
Rym: Like, pretty much the whole ground floor, there was nothing con down there at all.

157
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:04,100
Rym: It was just like restaurants and the big mall area.

158
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,380
Rym: And the thing is, that was all effectively, as far as PAX was concerned, convention space.

159
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,740
Rym: If the con was just going on down there, even though PAX had nothing to do with it.

160
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:19,340
Scott: Yeah, it's just people all over the building, no matter what part of the building it was, except for the one part where there was another convention.

161
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,306
Rym: And there was just this constant stream of people.

162
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,260
Rym: It's kind of like every counter, people are walking, but there were just so many people going up and down.

163
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,200
Rym: The escalators were just a sea of people.

164
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:32,079
Scott: And the escalators worked the whole time.

165
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:33,056
Rym: I can't believe that.

166
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,220
Rym: They never broke at all.

167
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,519
Rym: I'm trying to figure out why.

168
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,066
Scott: Because they're modern escalators.

169
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:39,154
Scott: Things in the west are new, things in the east are old.

170
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:40,560
Scott: You know when our escalators were made?

171
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:44,800
Rym: Actually, they were all rebuilt not that long ago, at the BCC at least.

172
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,339
Scott: East coast escalator repairmen suck, that's all I got to say.

173
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,846
Rym: I think there's a little bit more to it.

174
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:52,380
Rym: I think the crowd and the dynamic of... Not bad?

175
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,331
Rym: No, definitely not bad.

176
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:04,320
Rym: I think what it is, is that anime conventions in general seem to have people move around more than they did at PAX.

177
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,420
Rym: Because there are more events going on all over the place at different times.

178
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:13,880
Rym: And at the same time, for many people, depending on what you're into, less to do at any given point.

179
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,740
Rym: So people tend to walk around and walk back and forth a lot.

180
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,080
Rym: But here at PAX, everyone who was walking was on their way somewhere.

181
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:23,959
Rym: And then when they got there, they stopped and did something.

182
00:11:25,403 --> 00:11:27,880
Rym: You didn't see a lot of people just wandering aimlessly.

183
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,520
Scott: Yeah, a lot of people at Rookon wander aimlessly to look at cosplay or to be in cosplay.

184
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:35,000
Scott: And I do think that cosplay has a lot to do with it.

185
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,767
Rym: Yeah, that's the other thing.

186
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,100
Rym: Remember, no cosplayers.

187
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:38,389
Rym: There were plenty of cosplayers.

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,102
Rym: No, no.

189
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:41,440
Rym: There was effectively no cosplay.

190
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,180
Rym: In that, when you were just walking around, there was no one getting in your way taking pictures.

191
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:47,776
Rym: No one would stop and go, "Oh my god, look at that

192
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:48,280
Rym: cosplay.".

193
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,219
Rym: So as a result, the crowd just moved.

194
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,933
Scott: Yeah, there were people in costume.

195
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:52,740
Scott: Plenty of them.

196
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,100
Scott: It wasn't the majority.

197
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:55,927
Rym: It wasn't even the minority.

198
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:56,309
Rym: It was like 5%.

199
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:56,630
Rym: Maybe.

200
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,032
Rym: Not even.

201
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,220
Scott: If you looked around at any given point in time, you would see one or two costumes.

202
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:05,458
Scott: Depending on where you were and how many people were around at the time.

203
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:10,860
Rym: I use that term loosely because a lot of the costumes were basically just a guy in a Captain Hammer t-shirt.

204
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:15,013
Scott: Yeah, but the costumes never got in the way.

205
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:17,060
Scott: The cosplay had no effect on the con.

206
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:22,500
Scott: None of the things that cosplay does to a convention were happening.

207
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,080
Rym: But I think part of that was just because there was so little cosplay.

208
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:33,720
Rym: If there had been a ton of people in costume and an equal number of people trying to take pictures of people, then PAX would have ground to a grinding, blistering, horrible halt.

209
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,194
Scott: Probably.

210
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:41,540
Rym: But there wasn't really, despite all these space that held people, there weren't that many places to go.

211
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,900
Rym: It seems like there were a small number of high quality places to be at any given point.

212
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,649
Scott: Yeah, I mean, where could you go?

213
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,040
Scott: You go to main events, right?

214
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,405
Scott: You can go to the exhibition hall.

215
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,032
Scott: You can go to the PC room.

216
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:53,799
Scott: You can go to the console rooms.

217
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:56,369
Scott: You can go to one of the four tiny panel rooms.

218
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:57,494
Scott: You can go to the annex.

219
00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,060
Scott: You can go to the DS lounge.

220
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,660
Rym: Oh, don't forget, in the annex, on the third floor, we were mystified by this.

221
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,860
Rym: Remember, on level three, there's the Serpent Theatre.

222
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,980
Rym: And right next to it was the mystery space.

223
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,260
Scott: You want to talk about the mystery space?

224
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,388
Rym: We talked about it on the other show.

225
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:18,560
Rym: It was actually just kind of this lame... It wasn't really that lame, but it was a marketing ploy by someone.

226
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,120
Rym: You go and do these puzzles, and there was a guy chained up who looked like Jesus, answered like riddles and all these mini games.

227
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:27,379
Rym: A lot of the little kids were hanging out there.

228
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,568
Scott: Yeah, it was alright.

229
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,580
Scott: You know, that kind of thing.

230
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:32,500
Scott: If I was five years younger, that thing would have been awesome.

231
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:39,380
Rym: Well, the thing is, at the same time, I would have turned the mystery space into an idea we had that we're probably not going to talk about this show.

232
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:40,071
Scott: Yeah.

233
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:41,607
Rym: We have an idea.

234
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:43,380
Rym: There's one thing that was lacking from PAX.

235
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,380
Rym: If you can't figure it out, you'll find out in a future episode.

236
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:53,640
Rym: But, you know, we got all these places, and we decided, alright, let's go check out every possible thing.

237
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,640
Rym: So we actually went over to the console free play area, which is something I never do at gaming cons.

238
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:06,580
Rym: For some reason, I just have no desire, when I'm at a gaming con, to walk into a room with a bunch of consoles and play Smash Brothers, which seems like that's what most people do.

239
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,671
Scott: Yeah, it's like, I can play Smash Brothers at home.

240
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:09,556
Scott: I have friends.

241
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:10,220
Scott: I own the game.

242
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,840
Scott: Why do I want to spend my precious convention time playing it against people ten thousand times better than me?

243
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:17,048
Scott: And I know I'm not going to build it.

244
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:19,340
Scott: It's not, you know, it's like, I'm not one of those people who does it.

245
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,060
Scott: Some people don't want to play against someone better than them because they don't like to lose.

246
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:27,780
Scott: I don't like to play against people that much better than me because there's no way I can build skill.

247
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,025
Scott: I just die immediately.

248
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,840
Scott: If there was a way I could get better by sitting there and playing and playing and playing, I'd do it.

249
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:36,840
Scott: But I can't, mostly because you can't just keep sitting there and playing and playing.

250
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,940
Scott: It's loser walks at a convention, you know, because everyone's trying to get more people want time on the machine than there is time on the machine.

251
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,440
Scott: So I don't tend to do those sorts of things.

252
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:54,180
Rym: Well, part of it, too, is that you walk into any average, you know, gaming room, and there's pretty much, there's like the consoles with the right games that just, there's a line and people playing them constantly.

253
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:57,836
Rym: And then there's always the other consoles with games people don't really care that much about.

254
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:58,800
Rym: They just kind of sit there.

255
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,670
Rym: One guy walks up, plays for like two minutes, walks away.

256
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,020
Rym: Someone else walks up, like pokes at it, walks away.

257
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,020
Rym: PAX, once again, has transcended and they did something that I never really see.

258
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,500
Scott: Well, first of all, I was amazed that the console free play rooms, there were a bunch of them, right, on two different floors, I think.

259
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,385
Scott: But they were very, very small.

260
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:22,220
Scott: I think if you took them all and put them in one room, it would have been smaller than Otakon's video game room.

261
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,631
Rym: By far, Otakon has ten times the console gaming of PAX.

262
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,864
Scott: Yeah, it was crazy.

263
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:34,120
Scott: I mean, KatsuKon has a lot more console gaming than PAX.

264
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:43,279
Rym: But yet, you know, you finally walk into these to see what the deal is, and I noticed that any console that's not being played, there's not only no one at it, there's no game in it.

265
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:54,120
Rym: So we realized that what they've done is you go to a table, you check out a game, and then you get friends, and you go play that game with your friends, and when you're done, you take the game back.

266
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:54,850
Scott: Yep.

267
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:55,860
Rym: Brilliant!

268
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,041
Scott: It was brilliant.

269
00:15:57,362 --> 00:16:07,220
Scott: And the thing is, the result was that all the rooms where you could check out a game were pretty quiet because no one who didn't have a game checked out was in there, looking around, walking around.

270
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:11,060
Scott: All the people who didn't have a game yet were in the "get a game" room.

271
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,556
Rym: Yeah, the LFGs.

272
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:16,660
Scott: Yeah, there were two LFGs, and the LFGs- Yeah, were there three?

273
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,319
Rym: There were three.

274
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:31,260
Scott: Okay, there were three LFGs, and there were a lot of people in the LFGs, because in there, they sort of did the normal thing, where they had, you know, eight TVs, you know, with games already on them, running all the time, that you could play while you waited for the game you wanted to become available.

275
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:40,817
Scott: You know, those rooms are a little bit crowded, but pretty much everyone in there was not playing those games because they wanted to play them, but because they were playing them to wait for the game.

276
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:42,540
Scott: they actually wanted in their number to be called.

277
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,700
Scott: And, you know, I heard that the number calling went a little slowly.

278
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:58,120
Scott: You know, some people waited, you know, a half hour, maybe an hour for it to actually have their number called after they said what game they wanted, you know, but they think they put a half hour limit on people playing in the console rooms and such.

279
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:11,740
Scott: So, you know, they pretty much, you know, move people as quickly as they could, you know, pretty well every console and every one of the console free play rooms is being used all the time, at least that any, as long as someone was wanting to use it.

280
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:20,000
Scott: And that was it, you know, not if everyone at the con wanted to play a console, it wouldn't have worked, but not everyone wanted to play.

281
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:28,700
Rym: But just this idea of check out a game, it's kind of like the board game area, which at most cons they do this, where you check out a board game that you want to play and get people to play it with you.

282
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:38,180
Rym: So there was this, the culture was just completely different and it was more a vehicle to meet cool people and hang out with them than it was a vehicle to see who's the best of Smash Brothers.

283
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,501
Rym: Yeah.

284
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:49,300
Scott: And the other cool thing about it was like, you could go and if like, if you met someone at the con and you were like, hey, you know, want to play some of this, you could just play some of that no matter what that was.

285
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:50,807
Scott: Pretty much no matter what that was.

286
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:53,080
Scott: I mean, I think they obviously didn't have every video game ever.

287
00:17:53,300 --> 00:18:01,040
Rym: No matter what that was, because, you know, they had like the five or whatever console rooms on one floor, but on the other floor they had the two special free play rooms.

288
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,886
Rym: One of them was the leaderboard room.

289
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:05,696
Rym: They actually kept track of who was winning all these games.

290
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:06,720
Rym: There's this giant leaderboard.

291
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,943
Scott: You could win prizes, couldn't you?

292
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:08,625
Scott: I don't know.

293
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:09,608
Rym: I didn't even pay attention to that.

294
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:11,713
Scott: I never went in the leaderboard room, but there was.

295
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:14,160
Rym: no, it existed, but they had big monitors and they were keeping track.

296
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,862
Rym: It was really cool.

297
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:17,528
Rym: But they also had the classic console room.

298
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:17,748
Scott: Yes.

299
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:19,031
Scott: Who was running that room?

300
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:20,635
Rym: I don't know, but it was right.

301
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:22,720
Scott: They had a sign run by so-and-so sorry.

302
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:32,855
Scott: So-and-so I forgot who you were, but what they did is they actually had hours on Friday and their hours and Friday were less than the hours of the con and their hours and Saturday also looked to be relative,

303
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,440
Rym: but it was crossed out in marker and rewritten until 2 a.m

304
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:45,637
Scott: And it exactly, they decided that they were so awesome that on Saturday they were going to forego their original plan of doing weak ass hours and do kick ass hours instead.

305
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,440
Scott: So mad props to those guys.

306
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,843
Rym: So Scott says, Hey, I wonder if they have kaboom.

307
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,286
Rym: And I said, there's no fucking way they have kaboom.

308
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:56,732
Rym: So we walk up there and you know, we were looking around and we see all these old consoles.

309
00:18:56,992 --> 00:18:58,895
Rym: I mean, when they said classic, it was classic.

310
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,944
Rym: It was like every console you would have wanted to play.

311
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:10,173
Rym: I can say one thing, that room seemed more popular on average than the other rooms.

312
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:14,160
Scott: Well, cause I think it was a little easier in the other rooms, you know, you had less waiting.

313
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:22,290
Rym: Well, no, I think it's more that older games, a lot of those competitive old, like NES games are much more conducive to quick pickup competitive play.

314
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:29,300
Scott: Also that, you know, uh, those are games that you can't just play at home easily if you're some noob kid and you're not old school.

315
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,460
Scott: Yeah.

316
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,345
Rym: I mean, NES roms easy, but some of that stuff, not so easy.

317
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:36,831
Scott: I mean, if you just had an Atari Jaguar, I'd say Katsu Kan, he just put it there with a game in it.

318
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:38,954
Scott: People would play it a lot just for the novel.

319
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:39,515
Rym: We did that.

320
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:40,737
Rym: We brought my Atari 7,800 to Katsu Kan last year.

321
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,806
Rym: We put it up to this gigantic flat screen TV, and there were people like in awe of it.

322
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,369
Rym: We had an ET tournament as a result.

323
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:51,749
Rym: Yeah.

324
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:58,335
Rym: But, uh, so we're walking around and we look in the corner and sure enough, there's the Atari 2,600.

325
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,077
Rym: Kaboom is in it.

326
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,960
Rym: And there's a bunch of people playing it and yelling at each other.

327
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,702
Scott: The only Atari 2,600, at least the only one I saw.

328
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:06,743
Rym: What are the odds?

329
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:09,745
Scott: So of course I walk over the moment we walk in there too.

330
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,326
Scott: Those guys weren't in there the whole con.

331
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,687
Scott: They were there at the time we walked in there.

332
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,589
Scott: The only time we walked in there looking for Kaboom.

333
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:19,411
Scott: The Kaboom guys happened to be there at that time.

334
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:22,653
Rym: Kaboom is not a well known and popular game.

335
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:26,956
Scott: It's well known and popular, but it's not at the top of the list.

336
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:29,578
Scott: It's like, you know, second or third tier of old school.

337
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:32,420
Rym: It's one of those games where people will meet and they'll be like you Kaboom.

338
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,001
Rym: I Kaboom too.

339
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:35,362
Rym: Let's Kaboom together.

340
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:37,924
Scott: So, of course, likes to Kaboom with you.

341
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:38,725
Rym: Oh my God.

342
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:42,188
Rym: So I walk over there and I'm like, I see you guys are playing Kaboom.

343
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,989
Rym: And they're like, yeah, yeah, we are.

344
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,932
Rym: And I'm like, I don't think you understand how fucking good I am at Kaboom.

345
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:53,476
Rym: And they all go and they look at the one guy and they're like, I don't think you understand how good this guy is.

346
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:55,057
Rym: And the guy's like, what's your highest score?

347
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,018
Rym: And I'm like 90,000 something.

348
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:56,619
Rym: He's like 100,000 something.

349
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:00,425
Rym: And we kind of stare each other down.

350
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:02,068
Rym: And I'm about ready to throw down.

351
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:03,391
Rym: This is going to be like the best thing ever.

352
00:21:03,732 --> 00:21:05,336
Rym: And he says, we can't play.

353
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:07,180
Rym: These paddles are broken.

354
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,143
Scott: That's pretty typical for an Atari 2600.

355
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,226
Rym: This is the third set we've tried.

356
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:13,328
Rym: There aren't any more.

357
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:17,736
Rym: And I say, then he's like, you want to play anyway?

358
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:19,459
Rym: And I'm like, how broken are they?

359
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,140
Rym: He's like, you'll see.

360
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:22,600
Scott: Were they more broken than ours?

361
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,427
Rym: Let me put it this way, cause Scott watched this epic battle.

362
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:27,369
Rym: I was player two.

363
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,873
Rym: He was player one.

364
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:32,240
Rym: I've been known to play Kaboom for like a half hour straight.

365
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:40,220
Rym: And this guy might have even been better than me because his absolute high score was a little bit higher than my absolute high score.

366
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,840
Scott: I think his high score was way higher than yours if I remember.

367
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,142
Scott: 10,000 more?

368
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,188
Scott: No, I think it was a lot more.

369
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:45,813
Scott: I don't remember.

370
00:21:46,498 --> 00:21:46,800
Scott: Anyway.

371
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:50,489
Rym: Anyway, so he got like 130 and I got like 150.

372
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:51,391
Rym: They were so broken.

373
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,172
Scott: We really need to get some like Atari 2600 controllers in the box.

374
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,443
Rym: It was so sad.

375
00:22:01,503 --> 00:22:07,553
Rym: It was like watching Wayne Gretzky play hockey against Wayne Gretzky, but he was given a one inch.

376
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:11,760
Rym: They were both given one inch long sticks and the net was smaller than the puck.

377
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,999
Rym: Yeah, that's basically what it felt like.

378
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,858
Scott: It was real sad.

379
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:25,480
Rym: But at least I shook hands with the only person I've ever met in my entire life, other than my father, who had a chance of beating me at Kaboom.

380
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,843
Rym: I was excited.

381
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:28,306
Rym: I didn't have a business card.

382
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:32,976
Rym: So Kaboom guy, if you happen to hear this at all, drop me a line.

383
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:34,680
Rym: I will totally make sure we have a tournament.

384
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,397
Scott: Some I see on eBay, this guy claims Atari 2600, quote, jitter free paddles.

385
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:42,680
Scott: Work fab.

386
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:43,985
Scott: Oh, whatever.

387
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:46,554
Rym: I figured out I actually cracked open a third party once.

388
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:47,517
Rym: I'm just going to buff that thing.

389
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:48,300
Rym: I think it'll work fine.

390
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:48,962
Scott: Here's another people.

391
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,348
Scott: New set of paddles.

392
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,272
Scott: Right.

393
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:52,919
Scott: New, they say in box.

394
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,684
Rym: But just think about the magic of packs.

395
00:22:56,345 --> 00:23:06,960
Rym: What are the odds that I ran into the one awesome dude at Kaboom and his posse of shit talking friends when I am ready with my shit talking friends to bust out some Kaboom?

396
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:08,727
Scott: Yeah, it's good times.

397
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,960
Scott: If only Mega Man 2 was competitive.

398
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:15,161
Rym: We should make competitive Mega Man 2.

399
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:15,467
Scott: We should.

400
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:16,019
Scott: All right.

401
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:22,680
Rym: So I want to take a point because I said the serpent theater and, you know, our panel was in the Wolfman theater.

402
00:23:23,641 --> 00:23:27,856
Rym: The theaters all had names, the Wolfman, the serpent, the.

403
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,080
Rym: I don't remember what the other ones were.

404
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,561
Scott: I got him.

405
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:30,242
Scott: Give me a second.

406
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:38,380
Scott: The raven and the serpent walrus, raven walrus, serpent Wolfman.

407
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:43,900
Rym: So, you know, I was curious about that because when we originally got our letter about, hey, you guys are going to do this panel.

408
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:46,834
Rym: It just said, you know, auxiliary theater or whatever.

409
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:48,020
Rym: And it gave me a room number.

410
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:51,993
Rym: And then apparently at some point the name, the rooms all got names.

411
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:57,131
Rym: And someone asked about that at the Q and A. And I believe the answer that Tycho gave.

412
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:59,620
Rym: when Gabe said, yeah, where did those names come from?

413
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,091
Rym: He was like, yeah, I kind of just decided they should have names.

414
00:24:03,252 --> 00:24:05,720
Rym: So I kind of named them all at the last second.

415
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,885
Scott: Yeah, on his own.

416
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:10,060
Rym: So thus we got to perform in the Wolfman theater.

417
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,300
Scott: They should like put a big Wolfman up there or something.

418
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:16,088
Rym: I don't know, because to the geek, it's the Wolfman.

419
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:19,819
Rym: But to like the people in my office, when I told them I'm doing this panel, it was the Wolfman.

420
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:20,483
Scott: Yeah.

421
00:24:20,968 --> 00:24:22,279
Scott: Like Marv Wolfman.

422
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,099
Rym: I don't even know who that is.

423
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,107
Scott: That's a comic book writer.

424
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,531
Scott: He's not.

425
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:26,540
Scott: I don't like him, but other people.

426
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,439
Scott: Like Teen Titans and such.

427
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:37,600
Rym: Yeah, but panels, much like everything else being different at PAX, the panels at PAX were handled very differently from panels at any other convention.

428
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:46,760
Rym: I think we mentioned this, but they had a gap between every single panel, which was basically the time for the professional panelists to tear down their panel and leave.

429
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:54,700
Rym: Well, the incoming professional panelists set up their panels so that every single panel began with a crowd walking into people ready to roll.

430
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,631
Scott: Yeah, there was a 30 minute gap between every single panel and then they were staggered.

431
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:03,580
Scott: So two rooms, right, would have panels starting at one time.

432
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:12,980
Scott: And then a half hour later, the other rooms that have a panel starting and then a half hour later, the other panels would have a panel starting, you know, so that way it wasn't.

433
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,764
Scott: They all start at the same time.

434
00:25:14,784 --> 00:25:22,020
Scott: And then if you don't like the one you're in, well, there's, you know, two others you can go to without missing the beginnings of them.

435
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:28,839
Scott: So if you went to say Warhammer Online Age of Reckoning at two thirty, I got the schedule open here.

436
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:29,080
Scott: Right.

437
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,284
Scott: And you didn't like it.

438
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:34,400
Scott: Well, you couldn't go to democratizing game development because that also started at two thirty.

439
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:41,800
Scott: But you could go get in line for movie nerdcore rising or make the world notice, you know, and you'd be all set.

440
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,240
Rym: Well, you might be except that for the maybe not the vast majority of panels, but for all the panels that were in any way popular.

441
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:56,039
Rym: If you weren't there 45 minutes or more before the event in line, there was no way you were getting in.

442
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,474
Scott: Well, some of the panel rooms like the Serpent Theater was actually pretty big and you could.

443
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:02,120
Scott: there was a lot of standing room in the back.

444
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:07,120
Scott: You know, like we all we were standing in the back that there was going to be the well beaten panel, but we didn't want to hang around.

445
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,139
Scott: So we left, but we could have stood in the back for that.

446
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:09,461
Scott: Yeah.

447
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:15,580
Rym: But at the same time, those panel rooms, because they weren't in dedicated rooms, they were kind of loud and they're actually kind of difficult to hear the present.

448
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:15,880
Rym: Yeah.

449
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,482
Scott: There was the other.

450
00:26:17,163 --> 00:26:17,965
Scott: What was the other theater?

451
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:19,889
Scott: Was it the Raven, I think, or the walrus?

452
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:22,434
Scott: that I think was the walrus one that had the.

453
00:26:23,255 --> 00:26:25,199
Scott: it was sort of in a corner next to a D.S.

454
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:25,520
Scott: lounge.

455
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,288
Scott: Just open, completely open.

456
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:29,500
Scott: So you could just walk past it and see what was going on.

457
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,630
Rym: It was pretty much the worst panel room.

458
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,780
Rym: Like, I would have felt terrible if I was presenting in that room.

459
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,494
Scott: I'm real glad that wasn't the Wolfman Theater.

460
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:36,180
Scott: I would have been pissed.

461
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:43,680
Rym: Yeah, because the panel, of course, the panel I saw that were there looked like it would have been really awesome, except for the fact that it was kind of loud.

462
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:44,562
Scott: Yeah.

463
00:26:44,582 --> 00:26:44,662
Scott: Yeah.

464
00:26:45,064 --> 00:26:47,839
Scott: Panels need to be in closed rooms with doors.

465
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:59,360
Rym: Of course, at the same time, I think next next packs, they're going to have larger panel rooms because part of the reason they didn't have good panel rooms was that there was that other convention using the top floor of the convention center for no good reason.

466
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,664
Scott: Yeah, packs really needed those rooms, but they needed them badly.

467
00:27:02,684 --> 00:27:04,707
Rym: I mean, by and large, the panels.

468
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:07,450
Rym: I mean, we didn't get to go, obviously, to any panels.

469
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:14,240
Rym: But what everyone said was that the panels were generally super professional and really, really, really awesome.

470
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:29,240
Scott: Well, I mean, if you look, the vast majority of the panels were run by industry people, you know, either by people who are pimping out their own games or people, you know, people from a bunch of different companies who all made the same kind of game or all were interested in the same.

471
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,270
Scott: You know, the topic in gaming and they all discussed it together, you know, and stuff like that.

472
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,280
Scott: There wasn't a whole lot of fan panels and stuff like that.

473
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,840
Rym: I mean, like democratizing game development, the art of the dungeon master, sex and video games, a comparative study, the giant bomb reunion.

474
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,648
Rym: Honestly, a lot of people were talking about that.

475
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,000
Rym: I'd never heard of the giant bomb in my life.

476
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:50,400
Rym: Me either.

477
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,919
Rym: And then when everyone explained to me what it was, I still really wasn't sure what it was.

478
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:58,880
Scott: Here, I'm picking a random panel here that actually has the people listed.

479
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,201
Scott: All right.

480
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:03,280
Scott: Video games and piracy issues for an increasingly complex world.

481
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,360
Scott: Panelists include Dennis McCauley, moderator.

482
00:28:06,941 --> 00:28:06,981
Scott: OK.

483
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:09,740
Scott: Oh, and he's also the editor of GamePolitics.com.

484
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:11,063
Scott: Ah, that's a good site.

485
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:17,260
Scott: Jason Della Rocca, the executive director, International Game Developers Association.

486
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,080
Scott: Jennifer Mercurio Esquire, director, Government Affairs, Entertainment Consumer Association.

487
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,180
Scott: Chris Melissinos, chief gaming officer at Sun Microsystem.

488
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:32,240
Scott: So that's the kind of panel quality you're looking at at PAX, not like at even Otakon.

489
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,160
Scott: It'll be like, you know, yeah, the fan sub panel by some guys who've been doing it for the past few years.

490
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,304
Scott: The fans just like you.

491
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:41,388
Scott: It's just.

492
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:44,980
Rym: I got to say I wanted to go to the majority of these panels.

493
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,460
Rym: I couldn't just because I was doing other things and because you had to wait in line.

494
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:54,820
Rym: But other people like most of the people who were going to these panels were real excited about the panels.

495
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,300
Rym: And pretty much every panel had a lot of people excited about it.

496
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,000
Rym: And I don't know, in general, I feel as though other conventions could learn from this.

497
00:29:03,281 --> 00:29:04,686
Rym: I mean, at first I was really dubious.

498
00:29:04,726 --> 00:29:08,040
Rym: I thought this staggering meant, wow, there's going to be a lot fewer panels.

499
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:14,160
Rym: But no, all it meant was that the panels that were there were amazing and professional and great.

500
00:29:14,804 --> 00:29:15,880
Scott: Yeah, pretty much perfect.

501
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:18,689
Rym: And I feel like every convention in the world could learn from this.

502
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,900
Rym: quality matters a thousand times more than quantity.

503
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,579
Rym: Half as many amazing panels is worth a lot more.

504
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,502
Scott: Yep.

505
00:29:25,903 --> 00:29:30,720
Scott: I mean, if you have a billion panels at your card and everyone has something to do all the time.

506
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:37,199
Scott: Well, on the one hand, they start to feel worse after a certain point because they're not being able to do things they wanted to do.

507
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:40,939
Scott: People are much happier if they get to do the things they want to do.

508
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:48,100
Scott: And if you have less things, even if you have way too many people, we'll just have less things in bigger rooms and such.

509
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,020
Scott: People will feel a lot better if they can sort of plan out their day.

510
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:55,259
Scott: There's only one thing they want to do at any given time and they get to do it.

511
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:59,740
Scott: Rather than a million things to do, the quality is questionable.

512
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,820
Scott: If the quality is not questionable, then no matter what people's decision is, they'll be happy.

513
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:12,557
Scott: If people go to a panel and it's no good and they chose that over another panel, now they'll feel really bad because they chose something bad over something else that might have been good.

514
00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:13,079
Scott: they don't know.

515
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:27,380
Rym: And the one thing I can say is that FRC people who didn't go to PAX, if this is any indication, these are people who by and large do not go to panels at conventions, seemed really interested and/or excited in all these panels and they wish they could have gone just to go to some of them.

516
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:27,833
Rym: Yep.

517
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:31,370
Rym: And I'll admit, I really wanted to go to the panel right before ours, actually.

518
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,400
Rym: The Art of the Dungeon Master.

519
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,699
Scott: Had some Motzy peoples on it.

520
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,360
Rym: Yeah, we actually couldn't get into the room because that panel had a line similar to the line for our panel.

521
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:47,980
Scott: And it was completely full when we showed up and they didn't let us in until it let out.

522
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,079
Scott: And yeah, okay.

523
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,180
Scott: So of course, the biggest thing at PAX.

524
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,460
Scott: Oh, we should talk about this other thing first, right?

525
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,620
Scott: So even though we didn't really go to any panels, we were hanging around a lot.

526
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,620
Scott: Mostly near the Serpent Theatre, because it was just sort of open and near the tabletop gaming annex.

527
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:09,840
Scott: And in the Serpent Theatre, we happened to see parts of two early rounds of the Omega-Thon.

528
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:15,940
Rym: See, I had basically decided, and Scott agreed, there's so much awesome at PAX that we kind of had to pick and choose.

529
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,560
Rym: But it was picking between a bunch of awesome options as opposed to picking between a bunch of unknown quantities.

530
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:27,740
Rym: So we decided to generally not worry about seeing the Omega-Thon at all, except for the final round.

531
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:30,680
Rym: But we ended up accidentally seeing two of the rounds.

532
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,820
Scott: We didn't see the whole rounds, but we were standing there for a significant part of some of the rounds.

533
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,940
Scott: Two of them, specifically.

534
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,222
Rym: So, boom blocks.

535
00:31:38,723 --> 00:31:44,540
Rym: All I want to say is that green guy got totally hosed and it totally wasn't his fault.

536
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,500
Scott: I know, I was basically watching this boom block start and I can't really tell exactly how it works.

537
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,935
Scott: I'd never played it, and I would buy it if it was cheaper, but it's still like $45, so fuck that.

538
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,593
Scott: Basically, the first player threw their block at green.

539
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:00,420
Scott: The next player threw at green.

540
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,686
Scott: Then it was green's turn.

541
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:04,640
Scott: Green, like, failed to throw somehow.

542
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,082
Scott: I don't know.

543
00:32:05,102 --> 00:32:07,560
Scott: if they didn't know how to play or if there was something with their Wiimote, I don't know.

544
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,188
Scott: But green failed to make a throw.

545
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,640
Scott: The fourth player threw at green.

546
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,908
Scott: And I was just like, "Oh, this isn't a game.

547
00:32:13,928 --> 00:32:15,614
Scott: This is just a luck or skill.

548
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:16,819
Scott: It's a game of pick on one

549
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:17,140
Scott: person.".

550
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,480
Rym: Well, the thing is, the other game of boom blocks progressed in a similar way.

551
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:26,420
Rym: I'd wondered, I thought about this a lot, because I didn't try to be an omega naught or anything.

552
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,560
Rym: I wondered, how would I be if I was an omega naught?

553
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,100
Rym: Because part of me, when I play board games or video games or anything, especially when there's something on the line as opposed to just prize.

554
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,588
Scott: Yeah, remember, trip to Tokyo on the line.

555
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,693
Scott: Be evil.

556
00:32:40,854 --> 00:32:42,380
Scott: You must be evil and you're not going to win.

557
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,699
Rym: Yes, it's not just I get to laugh at Scott instead of him laughing at me.

558
00:32:46,242 --> 00:32:47,992
Rym: It's, "I get to go to Tokyo.

559
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,259
Rym: None of these people

560
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:49,319
Rym: do.".

561
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,500
Scott: Yeah, there's pretty much two equivalent game theory options in a situation like that.

562
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,809
Scott: Option number one, be a dick.

563
00:32:57,091 --> 00:32:58,960
Scott: Do absolutely everything you need to win.

564
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,164
Scott: Don't give a shit.

565
00:33:00,466 --> 00:33:01,692
Scott: Use your skill to your max.

566
00:33:01,752 --> 00:33:02,778
Scott: Win, win, win, win, win.

567
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:03,260
Scott: Right?

568
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,899
Scott: The other equivalent strategy is trust that you have enough skill to win when you need to.

569
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,147
Scott: Act like you're not so great.

570
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:14,000
Scott: That way people won't gang up on you because you're not so great.

571
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:22,940
Scott: They'll gang up on the much stronger player and use your skill to always stay alive by a hair until the final round where you whip out your full skill.

572
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:43,520
Rym: Now, I'm not going to get into the game theory rationale behind this, but that particular round of boom blocks, the one Scott was referring to, even though the other one progressed almost the exact same way, was exactly as vicious as I would have been and it was so cold and calculating and it proved everything I know about game theory in the real world.

573
00:33:43,961 --> 00:33:50,180
Rym: The first players chose green and said, I'm going to attack green and I'll bet they made a very calculated decision.

574
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:59,620
Rym: I'm not sure if they knew the other omega knots better than we knew the other omega knots, but the next players, the one who proved it because the next player looked at the situation.

575
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:05,060
Rym: And remember from the way this route, from what I gather, the way this round worked was four people play boom box blocks.

576
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,966
Rym: The top two go on.

577
00:34:07,027 --> 00:34:09,699
Rym: The bottom two are kicked out of the omega thon.

578
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:13,179
Scott: Yeah, and there's basically two simultaneous games of boom blocks.

579
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,580
Scott: You had four people on the left, four people on the right.

580
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:16,665
Rym: You're not trying to win.

581
00:34:17,147 --> 00:34:20,139
Rym: You are trying to make two other people lose.

582
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:28,280
Rym: So as a result, the strategy is make friends with someone, hopefully someone who actually you think sucks at the other games.

583
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,618
Scott: But someone who thinks that they're better than you.

584
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,002
Rym: And king make.

585
00:34:32,524 --> 00:34:40,440
Rym: I lie up and if I had been up there, I would have turned to player two and said, I will attack green.

586
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,020
Rym: If you also attack green, then we will be able to move on together.

587
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:46,224
Scott: Yep.

588
00:34:47,273 --> 00:34:48,179
Rym: And that is what happened.

589
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,331
Rym: And it was so wonderfully.

590
00:34:50,453 --> 00:34:51,117
Rym: game theory.

591
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:51,580
Rym: Delicious.

592
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,804
Rym: Everyone getting is.

593
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:56,043
Scott: if you have been player three or player four, you would have been S.O.L Yes.

594
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:56,728
Rym: Yes.

595
00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:58,020
Rym: That is how game theory works.

596
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,233
Rym: Because you have to jump on the opportunity.

597
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:01,460
Rym: You have to be a dick.

598
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:09,819
Rym: If the dog is down, kick that dog, because if you all gang up on green, you've reduced your chances of being eliminated from the omega by half by a quarter.

599
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,440
Scott: Well, depending on what kind of chances of getting kicked out were two and four.

600
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,299
Scott: And now your chances of getting kicked out are actually one in three.

601
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,881
Rym: Yes.

602
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:22,140
Rym: So that's why I was avoiding the statistics.

603
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:28,600
Rym: But suffice to say, the proper way to act is to seize upon weakness and be merciless.

604
00:35:28,942 --> 00:35:31,500
Rym: And I was so proud of player two.

605
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:35,180
Rym: I want to find out who player two was in that round, and I hope it's my man.

606
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,061
Scott: Right.

607
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:40,300
Scott: So then the other game we saw played in the Omega Thon was Geometry Wars.

608
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,900
Scott: And they played the mode in Geometry Wars where the sort of invincible shields bubbles appear.

609
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:52,120
Scott: And basically Geometry Wars is Robotron, but really flashy with lots and lots of lines and vectors and all over the place.

610
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:54,448
Scott: And it's actually a game of skill.

611
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,155
Scott: One of the few skill games in the Omega Thon.

612
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,460
Rym: In fact, it was really the first game that was actually really a game of skill.

613
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:02,383
Scott: Yeah.

614
00:36:02,403 --> 00:36:04,091
Scott: And basically these bubbles appear.

615
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:05,820
Scott: And if you go in the bubble, you're invincible.

616
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,520
Scott: So the basic idea with the game was go in the bubble, the bubble shrinking, get out of it before it kills you.

617
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:18,920
Scott: Go to another bubble that just opened up without dying on your way there and shoot as many bad guys as possible to get lots of points.

618
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,600
Rym: Now, let me tell you, because obviously they'd all practiced.

619
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,820
Rym: That was some epic Geometry Wars play like it.

620
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:26,124
Rym: There is nothing great.

621
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:31,160
Scott: You know, when the audience is watching a game and they go, oh, there was a lot of O's going on.

622
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,080
Rym: In video gaming, then playing or spectating among incredibly skilled players at a game.

623
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,200
Rym: If there are four people who are similarly skilled at a game of skill.

624
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,939
Rym: Well, I guess you couldn't be skilled at a game of chance.

625
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:50,460
Rym: And they are competing against each other and there's an audience who is knowledgeable about the game.

626
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:53,180
Rym: That is some really good entertainment right there.

627
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,380
Scott: Well, I mean, not everyone playing was as good as all the other guys.

628
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,380
Scott: There were, you know, clearly some people were better at the Geometry Wars than others.

629
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,360
Scott: I got to say this, but they're all better than me.

630
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,756
Rym: In the game we watched, the player who was yellow, that was some crazy.

631
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:05,560
Rym: Oh, my God.

632
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,257
Scott: Yeah, yellow pulled off this crazy crazy.

633
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,684
Rym: Yellow is going to die.

634
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:09,247
Rym: Holy shit.

635
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:09,649
Rym: Yellow just.

636
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:10,251
Rym: Oh, my God.

637
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:10,653
Rym: Yellow is good.

638
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:11,236
Rym: Oh, my God.

639
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:12,080
Rym: Yellow just avoided that.

640
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,480
Rym: Like yellow would be in the corner surrounded by bad guys about to die.

641
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,208
Rym: Suddenly everyone else is dead.

642
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:19,420
Scott: Yellow's left and yellow's left in a bubble.

643
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:22,059
Scott: And it's like, oh, it's all right.

644
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:23,043
Rym: Yeah.

645
00:37:23,063 --> 00:37:27,560
Rym: If you don't do other things at PAX, the Omega-thons, especially the later rounds.

646
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:29,471
Scott: It's worth your time to go.

647
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:30,780
Rym: Totally worth it.

648
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,700
Scott: I imagine I didn't go to the Jenga round.

649
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,099
Scott: I imagine the Jenga round would have been mad intense.

650
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,896
Scott: Just watching these people thinking it's going to fall, man.

651
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:38,178
Scott: Oh, man.

652
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:38,419
Rym: Oh, man.

653
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,880
Rym: So I point out at this point that we had not yet been to the exhibition room.

654
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,381
Scott: All right.

655
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:46,360
Scott: Now, the exhibition room at PAX is much fabled.

656
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,678
Scott: You know, basically people act like it's the new E3.

657
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:50,462
Scott: It is.

658
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,527
Rym: It is the new E3.

659
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:51,788
Scott: Yes.

660
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,300
Scott: But, you know, they act like it's this gigantic room.

661
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:57,439
Scott: You get all the big video game companies are there and they are.

662
00:37:57,761 --> 00:38:00,738
Scott: And they all bring the games that in olden days they would have brought to E3.

663
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,227
Scott: Games that aren't out yet.

664
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:04,160
Scott: You know, games they really want to sell.

665
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,895
Scott: Big fancy booths, the whole thing.

666
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:06,319
Scott: And they do.

667
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,400
Scott: But really, the exhibition hall was about as big as the New York Comic-Con.

668
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,660
Scott: It wasn't really that big square footage wise.

669
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:17,260
Scott: You know, I wasn't like impressed by the size.

670
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,680
Scott: I was able to cover the whole room pretty much.

671
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:26,720
Scott: I wasn't able to play every single game because I would have had to wait in lots of lines at many of the booths and a lot of the games weren't worth playing.

672
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,379
Scott: But I saw every booth.

673
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,200
Rym: But at the same time it was concentrated awesome.

674
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,220
Rym: It wasn't like a dealer's room.

675
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,140
Rym: I mean, the analogy of the exhibition hall to any other con is that's the dealer's room.

676
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,960
Rym: But there weren't actually that many people selling things.

677
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,970
Rym: It was mostly exhibitions.

678
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,638
Rym: It was people showing things off.

679
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:48,875
Scott: Well, they were advertising.

680
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:49,600
Scott: They were selling them.

681
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,800
Scott: But they weren't selling them right then and there.

682
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,600
Scott: They were trying to sell you on them so that you would later go to GameStop and buy them.

683
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,840
Rym: Yeah, but the people were actually selling things.

684
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,859
Rym: Like PinkGodzilla was selling some stuff and there was like one...

685
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,119
Scott: Namco was selling their Pac-Man merch.

686
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,940
Rym: There was one anime dealer selling like anime stuff.

687
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,900
Rym: And oh my god, those people rake it in because they were the only people there.

688
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,920
Scott: The people who were selling the retro video game stuff.

689
00:39:13,147 --> 00:39:13,718
Scott: That was about it.

690
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,272
Rym: Yeah, it was mostly Nintendo.

691
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:17,659
Rym: Play games that aren't out yet.

692
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:19,789
Rym: Play Fallout.

693
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,060
Rym: Oh my god, play Fallout.

694
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,675
Rym: Play Iron Jeff DS.

695
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,269
Scott: Play Left 4 Dead.

696
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,460
Scott: Oh my god, Left 4 Dead.

697
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:27,586
Rym: Play Starcraft 2.

698
00:39:27,586 --> 00:39:28,791
Scott: Oh my god, Starcraft 2.

699
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,338
Scott: Play World of Warcraft expansion.

700
00:39:30,358 --> 00:39:30,860
Scott: Oh my god.

701
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:38,200
Rym: Probably the most sought after booth in this entire exhibition hall I think would have been booth 632.

702
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,976
Rym: The Fallout 3 booth.

703
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,415
Scott: Well, it's either the Fallout booth or the Left 4 Dead booth.

704
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:42,220
Scott: It's a tough call.

705
00:39:42,522 --> 00:39:42,966
Scott: Tough call.

706
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,580
Scott: They both had long lines the whole time.

707
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,240
Rym: While they had similarly long lines, there were a lot more Fallouts to play.

708
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,620
Rym: So I think there were more people all told.

709
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:56,940
Rym: And also, the Fallout booth was the only way to get the Fallout puppet.

710
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,799
Scott: Not too many people got it.

711
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,140
Rym: Yes, the Fallout puppet was perhaps the greatest status symbol you could have at that con.

712
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:08,100
Rym: Other than an all access badge or an Omegathon shirt.

713
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,658
Scott: I was going to say, an Omegathon shirt is a pretty big status symbol.

714
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,400
Rym: The puppet was number 3 in terms of standing out in the crowd.

715
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,416
Scott: Pretty much, yeah.

716
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,416
Rym: Well, I guess number 4 was being me and Scott.

717
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:18,000
Rym: No, just kidding.

718
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,539
Rym: No, not even close.

719
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,620
Scott: No one noticed us at all except for our listeners and people at our panel.

720
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,236
Rym: Yeah, but all the people at the panel.

721
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:25,600
Rym: But anyway.

722
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,431
Rym: So, the Fallout booth.

723
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:30,300
Rym: I don't think you understand the tonight.

724
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,240
Rym: There were people in that line.

725
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,580
Rym: There were people lined up well before the exhibition hall opened on all three days.

726
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:43,280
Rym: To get into the exhibition hall the second it opened in order to line up to then hours later play Fallout 3.

727
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,500
Scott: That's actually not a bad idea.

728
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,760
Scott: Because look, the exhibition hall opens pretty much when the con opens, right?

729
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:53,620
Scott: So, if you wait in line before the con opens, you're not really losing any con in that line.

730
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:59,440
Scott: If you are really early in that line and you get to be really early in the Fallout line.

731
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:02,174
Scott: You could play Fallout at like maybe 10.05, 10.10 in the morning.

732
00:41:03,902 --> 00:41:09,580
Scott: And thus, you won't lose any of your con, any significant portion of it, and you'll get to play Fallout.

733
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,060
Scott: If you had tried to go play Fallout at pretty much any other time, you would have to wait for like an hour maybe.

734
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,149
Scott: Half hour to an hour.

735
00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:17,300
Scott: A long, long time.

736
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,580
Scott: You would have lost a significant portion of con time to just play this game.

737
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:27,360
Scott: So, waiting in line before the con to play Fallout or Left 4 Dead or Starcraft 2 was a pretty good idea.

738
00:41:27,562 --> 00:41:29,119
Scott: And the people doing it were pretty smart.

739
00:41:30,082 --> 00:41:33,100
Scott: I just didn't want to play those games badly enough to wait in those lines.

740
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,980
Rym: But I did want to play them every time I walked into this room.

741
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,580
Rym: I didn't want to play them just that badly.

742
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,273
Rym: But I'd walk into the room and be like, "Oh my god, I want to play Fallout.

743
00:41:40,313 --> 00:41:41,118
Rym: Oh my god, I want to play

744
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:41,419
Rym: Fallout.".

745
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:45,860
Rym: And then I'd see the line, and it's bigger than any line I've ever really wanted to stand in in my life.

746
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,833
Scott: Well, it's not that it was physically large.

747
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:48,860
Scott: I mean, it was pretty large.

748
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,300
Rym: Well, bigger in terms of how long it would take.

749
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:50,884
Scott: Exactly.

750
00:41:50,904 --> 00:41:52,380
Scott: It's because people are playing a game.

751
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:52,940
Rym: I'll put it this way.

752
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,819
Scott: And then they stop, and then one person goes and plays.

753
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,605
Rym: It's not even that it would have taken that long.

754
00:41:56,866 --> 00:42:06,960
Rym: It's that the opportunity cost at PAX, what I would have had to ma- I mean, I waited four hours to ride a rollercoaster once, but I wasn't missing anything.

755
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,920
Rym: I was missing other rollercoasters that I'd already ridden.

756
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,260
Rym: At PAX, every second I wasn't doing something, and I was standing in line instead, I was missing something.

757
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,980
Scott: We paid a lot of money to go to Seattle and stay in a hotel.

758
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,240
Scott: You can't waste a single moment of that incredibly short trip that you used all your vacation days on.

759
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,479
Rym: But luckily, I will say this.

760
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:31,760
Rym: Every single person I talked to who played Fallout was so excited about Fallout that I- Hold on, three by the way.

761
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,620
Rym: Yes, Fallout, not Fallout 1, which was fun when I was young.

762
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,109
Scott: I tried to play it recently.

763
00:42:37,774 --> 00:42:38,660
Scott: Let me tell a little story.

764
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,720
Scott: Fallout 1 is a game I tried to play a long time ago, and then I tried to play it again a year at RIT once.

765
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,600
Scott: And then I tried to play it very, very recently.

766
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:53,260
Scott: The last time Scott Johnson was over our house, he got it on GameTap for me with his account so I could try it again.

767
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:58,000
Scott: I did a little better this time, but that is a game that I just cannot play.

768
00:42:58,462 --> 00:43:00,776
Scott: I just completely fail at that game entirely.

769
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:04,115
Scott: I need someone to really help me.

770
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:04,760
Scott: I don't know.

771
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,410
Scott: I just can't figure it out.

772
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:07,680
Scott: I just die immediately.

773
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,367
Scott: I can't figure out where I'm going.

774
00:43:09,427 --> 00:43:10,373
Scott: It's too open-ended.

775
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:11,640
Scott: It's not my deal.

776
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,933
Scott: Maybe Fallout 3 will be a little better for me.

777
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:14,940
Scott: Fallout 1 was not.

778
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:35,680
Rym: But suffice to say, I am real excited about Fallout 3 because I feel like just based on the booth, if the booth is any indication, they know what it was that made Fallout good, and they know what parts of Fallout needed to go away and were just limitations of technology.

779
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,879
Rym: I think the game is going to be amazing, but I reserve judgment until I play it.

780
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,400
Scott: I am more excited about Left 4 Dead.

781
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,385
Scott: Oh man, Left 4 Dead.

782
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:47,057
Scott: I knew Valve was making a zombie game.

783
00:43:47,097 --> 00:43:47,720
Scott: That's what I knew.

784
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,300
Scott: And I had seen maybe some videos and some screenshots.

785
00:43:51,405 --> 00:44:04,239
Scott: I stood there watching people play a game of Left 4 Dead together, just seeing the people inside the door waiting at the door that they can't close for the final person to get in the door so they can close it.

786
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,520
Scott: That's some good gameplay right there.

787
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:12,440
Rym: Oh my god, I don't even want to get into it, but we saw game mechanics that made us drool.

788
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:16,780
Rym: What do zombie first person shooters need to be good?

789
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,840
Rym: They need objectives that don't suck.

790
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,439
Rym: They need zombies coming up to hell right now!

791
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,608
Rym: Prezé!

792
00:44:21,628 --> 00:44:21,770
Rym: Prezé!

793
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:22,780
Rym: They killed your parents!

794
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,228
Rym: Oh my god, did this game have that.

795
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:27,380
Rym: It had everything I want in a zombie game.

796
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:34,660
Scott: If you have a copy of Steam, and Half Life 2 works on your computer, and you don't buy Left 4 Dead, you're an idiot.

797
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,180
Rym: Because even if it sucks, this is the best chance zombie first person shooters have ever had.

798
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:42,212
Scott: It's pretty much going to be win.

799
00:44:42,253 --> 00:44:43,220
Scott: I can almost guarantee it.

800
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,900
Rym: And if it isn't, well, I'm going to take that chance.

801
00:44:46,302 --> 00:44:49,560
Scott: There were other games that were big, like Starcraft 2.

802
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,460
Scott: I looked at it a little bit, and I didn't really see enough of it to make any sort of judgement on it.

803
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:58,060
Scott: I can talk about Starcraft 2 videos that I saw online before the time.

804
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,620
Rym: I can say this, the people in line to play Starcraft 2 were Starcraft people.

805
00:45:03,528 --> 00:45:04,540
Rym: You could look at them and be like "wow".

806
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:13,520
Scott: I was watching some videos online of Starcraft 2 and some of the things they're changing in it and whatnot, and I was actually starting to feel good about it, because I was like "yeah, yeah, yeah".

807
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,204
Scott: I think so too.

808
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:27,820
Rym: I feel like Starcraft 2, at least based on what I saw, because I stood over someone's shoulder and watched them play like 10 minutes of it, it might be another instance of knowing what it is that made the original Starcraft popular, and distilling that into modern technology.

809
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,860
Scott: Yeah, well that's all Blizzard does is distill.

810
00:45:31,806 --> 00:45:32,520
Rym: Yes, but again...

811
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,975
Scott: I was reminded recently, there's a good RTS...

812
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:37,600
Rym: Oh, this is so sad.

813
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,354
Scott: There's an RTS in that bootleg demakes package.

814
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:43,000
Scott: that's actually a real RTS.

815
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,700
Scott: It's playable and has multiplayer.

816
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,640
Rym: Scott told me about this, but I'll just interject by pointing out that I did check this out, I played it.

817
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,919
Rym: This is pretty much, it is like, I would call it an RTS.

818
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,419
Rym: It is like the most generic, and this is the core of a basic RTS.

819
00:45:57,941 --> 00:45:59,480
Scott: It's a baby RTS, basically.

820
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:03,420
Scott: I tried to play it, and I was playing it as well as I thought I could play it.

821
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:09,877
Scott: I tried real hard, real hard, and basically it was "alright, I've built a bunch of ships,

822
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:10,338
Scott: attack!".

823
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:15,920
Scott: They have a million times the number of ships I have, they killed me instantly, then they came and attacked me.

824
00:46:16,342 --> 00:46:18,199
Rym: Oh my god, I got a fighter jet, let's go.

825
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,819
Rym: And they've got planets made out of fighter jets just waiting for it.

826
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,938
Scott: I just suck so much at RTSs.

827
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,840
Scott: It's just the building things fast enough, I just can't do it for some reason.

828
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,020
Rym: I've realized something, Scott, because you also suck at turn-based games.

829
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,880
Scott: I don't suck at turn-based games as much as real-time.

830
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,040
Rym: The thing is, turn-based games do not exemplify and bring out the flaws as much, because they're turn-based.

831
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,139
Rym: But when we play Advance Wars, you'll always be like, "Hey, Rym, I'm coming, I'm doing well, I'm doing

832
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:46,359
Rym: well.".

833
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,440
Rym: And then your one infantry gets to the middle of the map, ready to capture the cities in the middle.

834
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:59,300
Rym: And I've got four mega tanks sitting there, I've got 50 units maxed out, aircraft carriers all over the map.

835
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:06,000
Scott: I don't know how it works, I just can't figure out how to get things as quickly as people do in RTSs.

836
00:47:06,544 --> 00:47:07,051
Rym: Or turn-based games.

837
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,940
Scott: Part of it is clicking fast, but there's something else, maybe my brain is just broken in some way.

838
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,659
Rym: Scott, it's a defect of the womb.

839
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:16,058
Scott: Who knows what it is.

840
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,400
Scott: And because of that, I think I might not end up buying Starcraft 2 or whatever.

841
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,340
Scott: But that's only a fault in me, not a fault in the game.

842
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,070
Rym: Enough speculation.

843
00:47:26,111 --> 00:47:27,520
Rym: We shouldn't talk about games we didn't play.

844
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,680
Scott: Like LittleBigPlanet, which I didn't play?

845
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,040
Rym: Oh my god, do I want to play LittleBigPlanet, do I want to own it, do I want to touch it?

846
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,239
Scott: They had it on one screen on a dev console.

847
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:42,940
Rym: There was a crowd around that screen cheering and screaming, and oh my god are people into this game.

848
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,580
Rym: And you know what, it looks like it's really legitimate.

849
00:47:46,581 --> 00:47:55,500
Rym: Anyway, games we played, Scott and I went over to the Nintendo booth and we decided, why don't we both play two different games in order to maximize.

850
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,500
Rym: So I went over and played the new Mario baseball.

851
00:47:58,201 --> 00:48:01,519
Rym: All I want to say is Baseball Simulator 1000 is better than this game.

852
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,800
Scott: But, basically the pitch- You were saying better things about it at the con.

853
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,265
Rym: Well, no, it's fun.

854
00:48:08,506 --> 00:48:09,792
Rym: The pitching is really good.

855
00:48:10,113 --> 00:48:11,560
Rym: The batting is really good.

856
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,780
Scott: Is it better than Wii Sports Baseball?

857
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:14,679
Rym: Oh my god, yes.

858
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,158
Rym: Alright.

859
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,120
Rym: The fielding feels really, really, really automatic.

860
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:21,160
Scott: Oh, so there's basically no fielding.

861
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,618
Rym: Well the thing is, the guy running out and catching the ball, or getting to the ball, feels almost 100% automatic.

862
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,940
Rym: But the decisions of where to throw the ball when, and all the kind of strategic stuff, was really well done.

863
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:42,400
Rym: So, I don't think it's a buy when it comes out game, but I think it's a buy about halfway through its life cycle when it's $10 cheaper game.

864
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,521
Scott: Yeah, the thing is, Mario Golf for the GameCube was one of those games where I'm like, I'll buy this when it's $20.

865
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:48,840
Rym: It's still $50.

866
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,759
Scott: Well it's not, but I just never bought it.

867
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:58,800
Rym: Yeah, well I think the problem is that, while I like these games, we don't get enough play out of Mario Soccer, which is a fantastic game.

868
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,980
Scott: Yeah, we gotta play that some more.

869
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,040
Rym: We're gonna play that this weekend.

870
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:02,371
Rym: Alright.

871
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:03,403
Rym: We're playing it.

872
00:49:03,644 --> 00:49:08,840
Rym: That, and we're playing Mario Tennis, because once again, there's no way anyone can beat Team Rym and Scott.

873
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:10,400
Rym: At least in the front row crew.

874
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,739
Scott: Mario Tennis is the epic win.

875
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,119
Rym: Oh my god, I love those games.

876
00:49:13,681 --> 00:49:17,134
Scott: So yeah, I- So, while Rym was playing Mario Baseball, I mean they had other games there.

877
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:18,460
Scott: They had the new Animal Crossing.

878
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,480
Scott: They had some other games that weren't even made by Nintendo.

879
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,767
Scott: You know, I forget exactly.

880
00:49:23,808 --> 00:49:26,500
Scott: The only game I cared about was Wario Shake It.

881
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:31,980
Scott: Now, I don't know if people realize, listening to this podcast, that I am like the Wario fanboy.

882
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:41,620
Scott: And I'm not talking about Wario where, you know, I'm not talking about, I don't know, like playing as Mario in Mario Party or Smash Brothers.

883
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,320
Rym: Those Wario games for like the Game Boy that were crazy awesome.

884
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:49,340
Scott: Here's some history knowledge that you should, people, it's important to know, right?

885
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,020
Scott: Super Mario Brothers, that's the old game on the NES that came with Duck Hunt, right?

886
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:59,000
Scott: Super Mario World, that is the game for the Super Nintendo with Yoshi.

887
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:10,340
Scott: Super Mario Land, Super Mario Land is that Game Boy game, original Game Boy game with the Sphinxes and the submarine and the helicopter, remember that one?

888
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,740
Scott: The original Mario game for the Game Boy.

889
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,880
Rym: That wasn't a helicopter, it was a tiny biplane.

890
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,939
Scott: Anyway, that's Super Mario Land.

891
00:50:17,762 --> 00:50:24,220
Scott: Super Mario Land 2, the six golden coins, was a great Game Boy game.

892
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,366
Scott: It was a Mario game.

893
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,860
Scott: The boss of that game was Wario.

894
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,720
Scott: The first appearance of Wario was the boss of the six golden coins.

895
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,133
Scott: Super Mario Land 3 was called Wario Land.

896
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,752
Scott: It was Wario Land 1, right?

897
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:46,241
Scott: People don't realize that, that Super Mario Land 3 was Wario Land 1.

898
00:50:46,241 --> 00:50:49,639
Scott: That's the one where you're Wario and is the genie and the whole thing.

899
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:56,760
Scott: Then there was Wario 2, one of the greatest platforming games to ever exist, ever.

900
00:50:57,481 --> 00:51:02,420
Scott: It came out for Game Boy, but it was also one of those half Game Boy Color, half Game Boy games.

901
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,880
Scott: Then there was Wario Land 3, which was a Game Boy Color only game.

902
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:12,300
Scott: Then there was Wario Land 4, which is a Game Boy Advance only game.

903
00:51:12,622 --> 00:51:16,160
Scott: Neither of those were really as great as Wario 2.

904
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,279
Scott: They were just sort of more of the same and kind of eh.

905
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:22,160
Scott: Wario Land 4, especially for the GBA, was pretty eh.

906
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,839
Scott: I think because they were eh, they held off.

907
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,700
Scott: Notice how they switched over on the GBA to WarioWare instead of Wario Land.

908
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:32,280
Scott: They stopped making Wario Land games.

909
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,779
Scott: I mean, it was a really crappy Wario game for the GameCube, but ignore that, right?

910
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,240
Scott: So where did Wario Land, the 2D platforming Wario go?

911
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:44,240
Scott: He went to the Wii and Wario Land shake it for the Wii.

912
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,200
Scott: This is a Wii game, a real Wii game.

913
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,920
Scott: You're going to have to pay 50 bucks to get it on disc, right?

914
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,212
Scott: Not some WiiWare action.

915
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,360
Scott: You're actually going to pay 50 bucks for a Wii 2D platforming game.

916
00:51:57,542 --> 00:51:58,408
Scott: I played this game.

917
00:51:58,428 --> 00:51:59,676
Scott: This game is worth 70 dollars.

918
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:07,321
Scott: I'm a Wario fan, so maybe I'm biased, but this is the return to the greatness that was Wario 2.

919
00:52:07,321 --> 00:52:12,280
Scott: The addition of the Wii with the shaking of the Wiimote and such is not overbearing.

920
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,980
Scott: It's mostly hold it sideways, play a platformer.

921
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,400
Scott: It has all the greatness of, you know, the old Wario games.

922
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,040
Scott: You know, get the treasures, find the secrets.

923
00:52:21,461 --> 00:52:22,867
Scott: It's really hard to die.

924
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:26,140
Scott: The whole, you know, figure out the clever ways to get from here to there.

925
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:33,919
Rym: And in addition, in addition, the style, the way the game is presented to you, the graphic design, is totally Saturday morning cartoon.

926
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:35,887
Scott: Well, it's totally Wario.

927
00:52:35,927 --> 00:52:39,440
Scott: If you've ever played any Wario lands 2, 3, or 4, it's exactly like that.

928
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,780
Rym: Well, except for the fact that technology has allowed it to actually look like a Saturday morning cartoon.

929
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:44,436
Scott: Exactly.

930
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,320
Rym: And it looks fantastic.

931
00:52:46,642 --> 00:52:47,400
Scott: It's freaking awesome.

932
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,656
Rym: This is one of the first games on the Wii where I look at it and go, "Wow, that game looks

933
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:51,500
Rym: amazing.".

934
00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:59,460
Scott: It has the mechanic from the older Wario games of go to the end of the level, then you sort of have to get back to the beginning level before the time runs out.

935
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,820
Scott: And as soon as you hit the end of the level, the level itself changes.

936
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,780
Scott: It's like you'll go through the level and there'll be unreachable areas, and you have to reach them on the way back.

937
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:09,840
Scott: But on the way back, you're in a hurry.

938
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,331
Scott: And that was a really good mechanic in Wario 3 or 4.

939
00:53:13,331 --> 00:53:15,620
Scott: I forget which, I think in 4 they had that mechanic.

940
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,149
Scott: And I'm glad they kept it.

941
00:53:17,169 --> 00:53:18,960
Scott: It was the only good thing in Wario 4.

942
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:25,231
Rym: Alright, we probably shouldn't spend a whole bunch of time like we did talking about all the other... There was so much in this room.

943
00:53:25,271 --> 00:53:25,794
Rym: We should kind of...

944
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:28,896
Scott: Alright, let's talk about things really quickly.

945
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:29,138
Scott: Ready?

946
00:53:29,158 --> 00:53:29,380
Scott: Here we go.

947
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,179
Rym: The rest of this will be an overview.

948
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:36,340
Rym: For one, there was a table covered in nothing but rub-on Bomberman tattoos.

949
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,220
Scott: There were rub-on, there were water-on Bomberman temporary tattoos.

950
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,084
Rym: Same thing.

951
00:53:40,104 --> 00:53:41,895
Rym: They're little, you know, temporary tattoos.

952
00:53:41,936 --> 00:53:42,499
Rym: All I want to say...

953
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,059
Scott: We grabbed a fistful of them and we applied them...

954
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:44,984
Rym: I have like 50 of them.

955
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:48,100
Rym: Let me tell you, these were some of the highest quality little tattoos ever.

956
00:53:50,162 --> 00:54:03,980
Rym: If it weren't for the fact that I know tattoos look like crap after a relatively short amount of time being on a person, and they're also kind of indelible, I totally would have gotten the tattoo that exact same flamey on my bicep because they were really cool tattoos.

957
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:05,043
Scott: Yeah.

958
00:54:05,223 --> 00:54:13,440
Scott: Also, the pink Godzilla booth, which we said is one of the booths selling stuff, sold these Japanese DS-like containers that hold all your DS games.

959
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:14,532
Rym: Best DS case ever.

960
00:54:14,593 --> 00:54:14,999
Scott: Buy it.

961
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,482
Scott: I bought one.

962
00:54:15,522 --> 00:54:20,300
Scott: It holds like 4, 8, 12, 16, a whole bunch of DS games in a really small amount of space.

963
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,000
Rym: There's never been a better DS case.

964
00:54:22,303 --> 00:54:22,799
Scott: Nope, never.

965
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,699
Rym: Well, DS game case.

966
00:54:23,901 --> 00:54:24,519
Scott: Not that I've seen.

967
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,359
Scott: Razer was there, the company that makes the mouses and such.

968
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:32,720
Scott: We used their mouses and they weren't as bad as I thought they were.

969
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,180
Scott: I think they had some of those games set on easy though because I was owning.

970
00:54:37,581 --> 00:54:43,151
Scott: It's like I went to their booth and I was playing some FPS I never played before, and I was destroying everybody.

971
00:54:43,272 --> 00:54:44,740
Scott: Everyone is getting their ass kicked by me.

972
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,000
Scott: I shot so many people in the back of the head and so many people from far away.

973
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:50,640
Scott: I refuse to believe it was the mouse.

974
00:54:51,082 --> 00:54:52,187
Scott: I mean, it could have been.

975
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:54,780
Scott: I think they just, I don't know what it was, but I was killing everybody.

976
00:54:55,622 --> 00:54:57,578
Rym: I'm kind of thinking about buying one just because...

977
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,920
Scott: Well, it is your kind of mouse.

978
00:54:59,403 --> 00:55:00,140
Rym: It is my kind of mouse.

979
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:00,859
Scott: It's not my kind of mouse.

980
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,060
Rym: I'm very finicky about my mice.

981
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:08,960
Rym: Now speaking of mice, there was some other company and they basically were the "we're selling gimmicky mice" company.

982
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,540
Scott: They had this gun mouse basically.

983
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,060
Rym: It's basically shaped like a gun, like a handgun.

984
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,760
Scott: You hold it like your hand, you make a fist and you hold your fist just straight forward.

985
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:20,280
Scott: You don't turn your wrist over, you know, facing down.

986
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,040
Scott: Your palm faces to the left.

987
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:22,618
Rym: Like a gun.

988
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,539
Rym: But the thing is, you can also kind of tilt it and it's got buttons all over the place, but here's the thing that was interesting, because I thought I looked at it.

989
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,439
Rym: I stood there for like five minutes kind of laughing at it.

990
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,878
Rym: Well, chortling I guess, and going hee hee hee.

991
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,499
Rym: This thing is so dumb, just waiting for Scott to finish doing something so I could show it to him.

992
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:45,058
Rym: But then we both tried it and we realized that the sensor, because you can kind of whip it around and it has this long base going out in front to steady it.

993
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,940
Rym: The sensor is way up at the front.

994
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:54,620
Rym: So you can kind of whip it around like a gun and I actually decided to try it out.

995
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:06,400
Rym: It was surprisingly really easy to use and cool and I'd have to try it again, but all I want to say is it impressed me to the point that I'm willing to try it out again.

996
00:56:07,442 --> 00:56:10,577
Scott: Yeah, I mean, at first you put your hand on it and it's like, eww, weird.

997
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:16,992
Scott: But then you start playing this FPS with it and you're like, Alright, this isn't as stupid as it looks.

998
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:19,739
Scott: I'm making something to this.

999
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:28,900
Scott: I'm dubious, but I wouldn't use it for everyday mousing, but maybe if there was an FPS that it worked well with, maybe if that's your thing and you got some money to burn.

1000
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:29,680
Scott: It seemed to work.

1001
00:56:31,563 --> 00:56:35,539
Scott: It looked like the kind of thing that would never work, that was just a gimmick, but it had something to it.

1002
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,460
Rym: Alright, so you know that movie Idiocracy?

1003
00:56:37,947 --> 00:56:38,098
Rym: No.

1004
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:47,620
Rym: Well, in that movie, it's a movie that's up your alley, Scott, but there's an energy drink in that movie and they had samples of the energy drink to try and drink.

1005
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:52,220
Rym: There's a booth that was basically just drink this energy drink and Scott knows.

1006
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,379
Scott: Oh, the Brondo?

1007
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:57,680
Rym: I am the person who will go up to any energy drink and try it.

1008
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,037
Rym: and let me tell you, I didn't get to try it because they ran out right away.

1009
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,240
Scott: Yeah, geniuses come to PAX with not enough product for people to drink.

1010
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,780
Rym: But speaking of Idiocracy, there was a booth.

1011
00:57:07,981 --> 00:57:11,840
Rym: I'm not going to dignify the game by saying what game it was.

1012
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,920
Rym: If you were willing to shave your head and have the name of the game written on the back...

1013
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,040
Scott: No, they didn't write the name of the game.

1014
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:19,980
Scott: They just wrote the word "hell" on the back of your head.

1015
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,879
Rym: Oh, yeah, yeah, but basically if they shaved your head, they would give you a copy of the game.

1016
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,759
Scott: Well, what they did is they gave you a pre-order for the game so that later you would get the game when it came out.

1017
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,380
Rym: A surprising number of people shaved their heads for this game.

1018
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,680
Scott: I think a lot of them are people who shave their heads anyway.

1019
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,780
Scott: And basically they have a barber there.

1020
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:43,160
Scott: You sat down, they shaved your head, and they put the word "hell" on the back of your head and then they gave you a pre-order for this game.

1021
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,179
Scott: So you got the game for free.

1022
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:49,560
Rym: From what I found out, the barber basically was paid to sit there all day shaving heads.

1023
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,200
Scott: Yep, oh well, whatever.

1024
00:57:51,461 --> 00:57:53,159
Rym: And I heard that there was only one barber.

1025
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:57,180
Scott: Yeah, there was that one booth I mentioned that sold really, really retro stuff.

1026
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,879
Scott: They had some really, really retro stuff.

1027
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,799
Scott: Like retro stuff the likes of which you will not see anywhere else.

1028
00:58:03,263 --> 00:58:05,200
Scott: And it was all for sale, which is unbelievable.

1029
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,660
Rym: It was the kind of stuff that I usually see as like a museum piece.

1030
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,960
Rym: But it was just there for sale for about what you would expect.

1031
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:12,575
Scott: Yep.

1032
00:58:13,565 --> 00:58:14,380
Scott: What else is going on?

1033
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:18,780
Scott: Oh, there's a booth that sells the PAX merch and all Penny Arcade merch.

1034
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,057
Rym: It was gigantic.

1035
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,940
Scott: Yeah, it was a pretty big booth.

1036
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,620
Scott: And there were two lines, so you could go to either side of it.

1037
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:26,009
Scott: We were stupid.

1038
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:27,060
Scott: We saw a line for it.

1039
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,053
Scott: We're like, "Yeah, we'll go back

1040
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:28,398
Scott: later.".

1041
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:30,860
Scott: We came back later, the PAX shirts were sold out.

1042
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,900
Scott: They sold out of PAX shirts.

1043
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,167
Scott: I was like,

1044
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:32,475
Scott: "Fuck!".

1045
00:58:32,841 --> 00:58:36,580
Rym: Every single one of them in every size was sold out relatively early.

1046
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:40,480
Scott: I think that they should just ask your t-shirt size when you get a badge and they should just give one to everybody.

1047
00:58:40,661 --> 00:58:41,760
Rym: Even if they raise the badge price.

1048
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,620
Scott: And raise the price to make everyone pay for one.

1049
00:58:43,942 --> 00:58:44,669
Rym: I'd be fine with that.

1050
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,660
Rym: That'd be pretty cool, actually.

1051
00:58:46,282 --> 00:58:49,040
Rym: And then make pre-registering the only way to get a shirt.

1052
00:58:49,381 --> 00:58:49,720
Scott: Exactly.

1053
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:50,230
Rym: Yeah.

1054
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:52,669
Rym: I found Iron Chef DS.

1055
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:53,332
Rym: I played it.

1056
00:58:53,775 --> 00:58:54,700
Rym: It was kind of okay.

1057
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:58,120
Scott: It was just Cooking Mama only with an Iron Chef America theme on it.

1058
00:58:58,302 --> 00:58:58,900
Rym: It was kind of fun.

1059
00:58:58,981 --> 00:58:59,719
Scott: I played a little bit.

1060
00:59:00,742 --> 00:59:01,378
Rym: Let me put it this way.

1061
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:04,700
Rym: It was kind of fun, but the versus mechanic.

1062
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:08,580
Rym: The mechanic of the game was very, very clever.

1063
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,519
Rym: And I'll leave it at that.

1064
00:59:09,941 --> 00:59:10,122
Scott: Yeah.

1065
00:59:10,142 --> 00:59:12,380
Scott: There was a Red Riding Hood DS game.

1066
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,858
Scott: I don't remember exactly what it was.

1067
00:59:14,683 --> 00:59:15,659
Rym: Was it Kill Zombies?

1068
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,900
Scott: It was like Shoot Zombies, You're Red Riding Hood or some crap.

1069
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:19,678
Scott: It was fucked up.

1070
00:59:20,303 --> 00:59:22,820
Scott: I tried to play it and I couldn't figure out the controls.

1071
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,978
Scott: They were so screwy.

1072
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,980
Rym: And the person demoing it seemed to know there was a problem.

1073
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,420
Rym: Because apparently a lot of people are having trouble with this.

1074
00:59:29,642 --> 00:59:31,400
Scott: She was like, do you need me to show you how to play?

1075
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,380
Scott: And I'm like, no, I'm going to figure it out.

1076
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:35,519
Scott: And no, it was not.

1077
00:59:35,821 --> 00:59:36,478
Scott: Don't buy it.

1078
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,060
Scott: Don't bother.

1079
00:59:38,122 --> 00:59:38,937
Scott: Let's see what else is going on.

1080
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,620
Scott: Oh, there's the animal boxing game.

1081
00:59:40,861 --> 00:59:41,074
Scott: All right.

1082
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,760
Rym: Animal boxing is animal boxing.

1083
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,740
Rym: It is humans versus animals.

1084
00:59:46,302 --> 00:59:48,140
Rym: The game is kind of okay for play.

1085
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,079
Rym: Like I didn't play it long enough to say if it's a great game, but I can say one thing.

1086
00:59:52,462 --> 00:59:54,840
Rym: The game gets like 10 points for style.

1087
00:59:55,302 --> 00:59:56,820
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't get any points for play.

1088
00:59:56,981 --> 01:00:01,240
Scott: I basically played it and I vigorously tapped the stylus on the animal and then it eventually fell over.

1089
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,320
Rym: But at the same time, multiplayer against a human might be really fun.

1090
01:00:05,221 --> 01:00:07,820
Rym: There were Rock Band and Guitar Hero.

1091
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,761
Scott: Well, Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero 4.

1092
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:11,499
Rym: Yes, obviously.

1093
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,919
Rym: Stages set up, gigantic ones.

1094
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,140
Rym: And like people were basically playing concerts.

1095
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:23,160
Rym: And while I'm not interested in these games, people were really having a good time with that.

1096
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,179
Scott: If you walked over to them at any point in time, there were people playing them.

1097
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:32,920
Scott: And from what it seemed to me, it seemed like people liked Rock Band 2 a little bit better than they like Guitar Hero 4.

1098
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:39,280
Scott: But there was some music in Guitar Hero 4 such as Van Halen that was not in Rock Band that people really liked and would, you know.

1099
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:45,780
Scott: And actually, you know, Konami is coming out with their, you know, rock whatever, rock revolution or whatever they're calling it.

1100
01:00:45,904 --> 01:00:46,138
Scott: Right.

1101
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:49,540
Scott: I was actually reading some details about that today on the Internet.

1102
01:00:50,463 --> 01:00:51,960
Scott: And I'll talk about it more later.

1103
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:56,339
Scott: But it looks like maybe Konami has the right idea and is going to go somewhere.

1104
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:06,599
Scott: You know, the gods of rhythm games might, you know, we doubted them coming into this plastic instrument zone, you know, given that they had lost, you know, with their guitar freaks back in the day.

1105
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:08,600
Scott: But I think they might have learned something.

1106
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,100
Scott: And I would watch out for the Konami rock game.

1107
01:01:11,664 --> 01:01:17,240
Rym: While I was watching people play the Guitar Hero, I overheard a conversation from the people who were next up to play.

1108
01:01:17,702 --> 01:01:20,320
Rym: And one guy turned to, I guess it was a girlfriend or someone.

1109
01:01:20,601 --> 01:01:24,120
Rym: It seemed like girlfriend because they were totally making kissy faces at each other.

1110
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:33,940
Rym: But he basically said, I'm something to the effect of, we'll see how this plays out, because after Guitar Hero three, well, I don't know anymore.

1111
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:35,059
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

1112
01:01:35,421 --> 01:01:35,798
Scott: All right.

1113
01:01:36,724 --> 01:01:40,400
Scott: So there's in the way back of the exhibition hall, there was this Intel booth.

1114
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:42,259
Scott: They basically had a trailer that you could go inside.

1115
01:01:43,021 --> 01:01:46,920
Rym: It was Intel Extreme Gaming, eight core monstrosities.

1116
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,219
Rym: Check out the biggest, baddest things.

1117
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,540
Scott: They had the craziest possible computers you could possibly get.

1118
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,380
Scott: They were all Intel machines and they were all running all sorts of different games.

1119
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,220
Rym: Now, this, you can make this shit up.

1120
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:05,880
Rym: So we walk in and Scott stands in front of this kind of low powered like economy game.

1121
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,040
Scott: It was like a fifteen hundred.

1122
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,900
Scott: It said they had prices on all the machines.

1123
01:02:08,961 --> 01:02:11,060
Scott: It was like, here's a fifteen hundred dollar gaming machine.

1124
01:02:11,402 --> 01:02:14,839
Scott: So I got in front of it and I started playing whatever game was on there, some FPS.

1125
01:02:15,301 --> 01:02:18,660
Rym: And right next to it was the kind of the best machine they had.

1126
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,880
Scott: This was like a four five thousand dollar game.

1127
01:02:21,001 --> 01:02:24,020
Rym: This was like this ludicrous gaming machine.

1128
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:27,579
Rym: And we both hit, you know, start the game at the same time.

1129
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,140
Rym: Scott's game loaded like ten times faster than mine.

1130
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,100
Scott: My machine was just working just fine.

1131
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,020
Rym: Mine was slow as shit.

1132
01:02:37,342 --> 01:02:40,060
Scott: Obviously, I'm not saying it's because of Intel hardware or anything like that.

1133
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,780
Rym: Something was wrong with this demo.

1134
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,300
Scott: Something was wrong with the software set up on the machine.

1135
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,240
Scott: Maybe they had the software running two copies at once or something.

1136
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,660
Rym: The fact that I was standing in front of what Intel is telling me is the best gaming machine money can buy.

1137
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:54,459
Rym: And it really wasn't working.

1138
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,060
Rym: Scott's in front of the economy.

1139
01:02:56,581 --> 01:02:58,520
Rym: Well, you can probably afford this one.

1140
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,399
Rym: It was working great.

1141
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,573
Scott: Yeah, it was just because the machine was set up.

1142
01:03:01,633 --> 01:03:02,420
Scott: poorly, obviously.

1143
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:07,720
Scott: But it shows people running that booth weren't making sure the machines were reflecting their product well.

1144
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,780
Rym: And of course, there was the voting and all the stuff for the Pax 10.

1145
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:15,820
Rym: But I feel like we should talk about the Pax 10 after we have played all 10 Pax 10.

1146
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:21,640
Scott: Basically, the deal is the Pax 10, they had a Pax themselves, right?

1147
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,962
Scott: I guess Gabe and Tycho, I don't know, maybe some other people, picked 10 independent games that are the Pax 10.

1148
01:03:26,962 --> 01:03:30,180
Scott: And they had a booth there where you could play all of these 10 games.

1149
01:03:30,563 --> 01:03:32,280
Scott: And you could vote on which one was the best.

1150
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:34,180
Scott: And the best one won something good.

1151
01:03:34,862 --> 01:03:37,680
Scott: And there were these 10 different indie games.

1152
01:03:38,182 --> 01:03:40,420
Scott: And we played a bunch of them, actually.

1153
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,040
Scott: And some of them we didn't even realize are Pax 10 games.

1154
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:48,140
Scott: And they were all, you know, the ones we played were all pretty interesting in one way or another.

1155
01:03:48,802 --> 01:03:51,500
Scott: And I guess we'll talk more about them in the future at some point.

1156
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:57,000
Rym: Yeah, they definitely deserve a dedicated, at least a bit in a show, as opposed to an offhand mention here.

1157
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:03,220
Scott: There was this one called Project Aftermath, though, that if we played that one the most of all of them, and Rym played it, actually.

1158
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:08,380
Scott: And if they get the multiplayer on that game set up right, it could be something wicked awesome.

1159
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:14,920
Rym: Yes, suffice to say, Project Aftermath is a game that I'm going to be watching with great interest.

1160
01:04:15,622 --> 01:04:18,560
Scott: I can't guarantee a winner, but it's something to keep your eye on.

1161
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:25,440
Rym: If any game has a chance of pulling this kind of game off, and I point out that I've never seen a game pull this kind of game off.

1162
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,258
Rym: I've seen very few people even attempt it.

1163
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,140
Rym: Project Aftermath could be the game.

1164
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:36,820
Scott: There was also a game that was made by a team of people from RIT, so go RIT.

1165
01:04:37,901 --> 01:04:45,280
Rym: Yes, but the one cool thing I want to mention about the exhibition hall is that it was up across this big skyway.

1166
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:51,060
Rym: And you walk around outside the front of the con, there's this kind of big skyway above you, with glass windows and a glass roof.

1167
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:56,660
Rym: That was like this hangout area between the exhibition hall and the rest of the con.

1168
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:02,660
Rym: And there was cool stuff out there, like all the bands had their little booths to hang out there and meet after the concerts.

1169
01:05:03,783 --> 01:05:05,899
Rym: There were a whole bunch of sumos and just cool stuff.

1170
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:11,080
Scott: Yeah, it was a good, nice and airy room that made it a comfortable space.

1171
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:15,399
Scott: Like if you exited the exhibition hall, you could go "ahh" and not be crowded in.

1172
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,519
Scott: And it made traffic in and out of the exhibition hall really smooth.

1173
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:23,500
Scott: Whereas Otakon, where they're dealer's room, is sort of a narrow entryway and a narrow exit.

1174
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:26,520
Scott: So they need to separate the entryway and the exit to keep it smooth.

1175
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:32,160
Scott: But they were able to keep it smooth by just having a giant whole bunch of doors going into a giant empty room.

1176
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:40,540
Rym: But all that aside, we did all these things and then eventually it comes around to 4 o'clock or so, we got ready to do our panel.

1177
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,127
Scott: We had to do our Beyond D&D panel.

1178
01:05:43,268 --> 01:05:50,920
Scott: It was the same Beyond D&D panel we did at ConnectiCon, except I feel like we sort of ran out of material a little quickly.

1179
01:05:51,262 --> 01:05:52,279
Rym: I don't think so at all.

1180
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,040
Scott: And we had to keep talking.

1181
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,006
Rym: I don't think so at all.

1182
01:05:55,026 --> 01:05:56,840
Rym: We had another hour easily of material.

1183
01:05:57,101 --> 01:06:02,259
Rym: We had to cut everything off pointedly in order to say the bare minimum things we wanted to say.

1184
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,040
Scott: I don't know about that.

1185
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,960
Scott: I felt, because I was looking at the clock after we were starting to get towards the end of the slides, and we had like a half hour left.

1186
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,820
Rym: Scott, at ConnectiCon, we got to the end of the slides at about the same point.

1187
01:06:14,001 --> 01:06:16,199
Rym: And then we just talked without slides for the rest of it.

1188
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:16,823
Scott: Yeah.

1189
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:17,852
Scott: Oh, it was alright.

1190
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:18,720
Scott: It was a great panel.

1191
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,014
Rym: In fact, it was paced almost the exact same way.

1192
01:06:21,054 --> 01:06:21,839
Rym: I don't know where you get this.

1193
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:28,760
Scott: Anyway, it was actually the panel had this giant line forming, just as every other panel had a giant line forming.

1194
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:34,060
Rym: Basically, most cons, we go to our panel room like five minutes before the panel, because we're doing a million panels.

1195
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,211
Rym: But here at PAX, we only had one.

1196
01:06:36,231 --> 01:06:38,060
Rym: This was our only obligation.

1197
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:41,216
Rym: So we got dinner, took a nap, got all prepared.

1198
01:06:41,256 --> 01:06:42,040
Rym: We came back over.

1199
01:06:42,822 --> 01:06:45,840
Rym: We walk over to the panel room a little over an hour before our panel.

1200
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:51,040
Rym: And there are already a lot of people lined up for this panel.

1201
01:06:51,181 --> 01:06:55,840
Scott: I had a feeling like people were lining up for every panel at the con, and ours was not an exception.

1202
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,311
Scott: People were definitely digging our panel.

1203
01:06:58,331 --> 01:06:59,396
Scott: You know, they read the description.

1204
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:00,180
Scott: They saw the title.

1205
01:07:00,622 --> 01:07:02,171
Scott: They knew us for whatever reason.

1206
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:03,520
Scott: They wanted to be there.

1207
01:07:03,862 --> 01:07:06,480
Scott: In fact, they ran it right after Art of the Dungeon Master.

1208
01:07:06,921 --> 01:07:14,540
Scott: And I think a lot of Art of the Dungeon Master people wanted to go to our panel also and couldn't, because they left that panel and then had to get in the line for ours immediately.

1209
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:17,591
Scott: And some of them, you know, it just the room wasn't that big.

1210
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,700
Scott: It would only seated like a hundred people, maybe.

1211
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:29,660
Rym: It was kind of good, but also bad, because I feel like some of those WotC people from the previous panel might have wanted to be at our panel, because it was the WotC people talking about being a game master.

1212
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:33,260
Rym: And then right after, some guys talking about why D&D is kind of poop.

1213
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:34,141
Scott: Yeah.

1214
01:07:34,663 --> 01:07:37,375
Scott: I looked around online, you know, for feedback of our panel.

1215
01:07:37,395 --> 01:07:38,460
Scott: There was actually quite a bit.

1216
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:46,959
Scott: And everyone was saying good things, but one guy said, "Yeah, you guys basically spent the whole time saying D&D sucks, but no, really, it

1217
01:07:46,999 --> 01:07:47,300
Scott: doesn't.".

1218
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,048
Scott: Which we kind of did a little bit.

1219
01:07:49,108 --> 01:08:00,651
Scott: It's just we really tried to avoid doing that, but it's hard, because D&D is the reference point everyone has to go by, so you have to keep using it to compare to, and thus it seems like you're saying it's poop, but really,

1220
01:08:00,671 --> 01:08:01,233
Rym: we were

1221
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:02,900
Scott: saying D&D isn't poop, it's different.

1222
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,660
Rym: Well, what we said that it seems like most people got was that for role-playing, D&D really is poop.

1223
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,280
Rym: Yeah.

1224
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,939
Rym: If you want to role-play, there's no reason to use D&D.

1225
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,720
Scott: Well, role-play as per the definition of role-playing, which we defined at the beginning of the panel.

1226
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:21,120
Rym: If you want to role-play, as in play a role in a collaborative storytelling environment, D&D provides almost nothing for that.

1227
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:21,620
Rym: But anyway.

1228
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:22,538
Scott: Less than nothing.

1229
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:28,899
Rym: That was our panel, and we did this panel, and the panel went over amazingly well.

1230
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,580
Rym: We had Luke Crane and Jared Sorensen.

1231
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,678
Scott: We had to get them in because they didn't show up early enough.

1232
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:36,269
Rym: Yeah, basically, Luke Crane calls me, he's like, "Yeah, we're outside.

1233
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:38,354
Rym: They're not going to let us in.

1234
01:08:38,395 --> 01:08:39,497
Rym: They're telling us that there's no

1235
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:39,839
Rym: room.".

1236
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:43,136
Rym: And I was like, I motioned to the staffer, and the staffer's like,

1237
01:08:43,156 --> 01:08:43,698
Rym: "Huh?".

1238
01:08:44,242 --> 01:08:46,613
Rym: And I motioned, and I'm like, "All right, tell them you're with me.

1239
01:08:46,734 --> 01:08:47,537
Rym: I'm waving to them right

1240
01:08:47,578 --> 01:08:47,779
Rym: now.".

1241
01:08:48,403 --> 01:08:49,350
Rym: And they let these two in.

1242
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:50,620
Rym: We gave them seats at the front.

1243
01:08:51,760 --> 01:09:00,859
Rym: And there was nothing cooler than doing a panel that is so heavily influenced by two people who have so much to do with the indie role-playing game scene.

1244
01:09:01,801 --> 01:09:06,698
Rym: And there was a point of the panel where we said something, and they looked at each other, and one of them was like,

1245
01:09:06,718 --> 01:09:07,180
Rym: "Huh?".

1246
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,406
Rym: It was like, "Uh, huh,

1247
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:09,331
Rym: oh.".

1248
01:09:12,221 --> 01:09:14,778
Rym: And they started nodding and thinking like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1249
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:14,877
Rym: no.".

1250
01:09:16,261 --> 01:09:18,740
Rym: I feel like we might have given them some minor insight.

1251
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:19,481
Scott: Maybe.

1252
01:09:19,662 --> 01:09:24,340
Scott: Also, it's good when you start talking about a dude's game.

1253
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:28,740
Scott: Because when Luke Crane talks about his own game, he does his little Luke Crane dance.

1254
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:29,671
Scott: He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1255
01:09:29,692 --> 01:09:29,854
Scott: yeah.".

1256
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:34,975
Scott: So when I was talking like, "Let's say you want to climb Mount Everest.

1257
01:09:35,015 --> 01:09:36,000
Scott: That takes eight dice.

1258
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:37,645
Scott: Your climbing skill is four.

1259
01:09:37,725 --> 01:09:41,598
Scott: That means eight of your four dice need to show

1260
01:09:41,718 --> 01:09:41,798
Scott: up.".

1261
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,300
Scott: You know, that's the kind of awesome thing there is in Burning Wheel.

1262
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:47,959
Scott: And he starts doing his little dance, and I'm like, "Yeah, I made him do his little

1263
01:09:47,999 --> 01:09:48,140
Scott: dance.".

1264
01:09:48,661 --> 01:09:51,274
Rym: And when I said the words, "My aunt is an abbess,".

1265
01:09:51,334 --> 01:09:52,399
Rym: I think he about lost it.

1266
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,799
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

1267
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:59,180
Scott: So you know you're doing good when you can entertain the guy who made something by talking about the thing he made.

1268
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:03,000
Scott: I mean, imagine if you went and you were talking about Super Mario Brothers.

1269
01:10:03,161 --> 01:10:06,300
Scott: Miyamoto was sitting there, and you start talking about Mario Brothers.

1270
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,490
Scott: And all the things you say, he's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1271
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:10,253
Scott: He's got it right.

1272
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:11,016
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1273
01:10:11,076 --> 01:10:11,257
Scott: What's

1274
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:11,497
Scott: up?".

1275
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,973
Scott: Whereas I don't think Miyamoto would be like that.

1276
01:10:13,993 --> 01:10:14,658
Scott: He'd be like, "Oh,

1277
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:14,880
Scott: oh.".

1278
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,697
Rym: We basically, with one minute to go, had to say, "Oh, my God.

1279
01:10:19,717 --> 01:10:20,038
Rym: We're out of

1280
01:10:20,099 --> 01:10:20,380
Rym: time.".

1281
01:10:21,003 --> 01:10:24,459
Rym: We talked a whole bunch real quick and got a whole bunch more out there.

1282
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:30,394
Rym: And then, basically, we took the entire crowd and said, "All right, kids.

1283
01:10:30,915 --> 01:10:31,697
Rym: You want more?

1284
01:10:32,218 --> 01:10:32,599
Rym: Follow

1285
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:32,860
Rym: us.".

1286
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:37,040
Rym: And the scary thing is, everyone tried to follow us.

1287
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,260
Scott: Pretty much the vast majority of that room tried to follow us.

1288
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:47,720
Rym: So thus, chaos ensued as me and Jared Sorensen have this gaggle of 20 people following us.

1289
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:50,080
Scott: I have a gaggle, and Luke Crane has a third gaggle.

1290
01:10:50,462 --> 01:10:51,818
Scott: So we're- Three gaggles.

1291
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:55,010
Rym: Basically, we got these crowds.

1292
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,395
Rym: We realized, "Uh-oh.

1293
01:10:56,696 --> 01:10:57,399
Rym: We can't deal with

1294
01:10:57,439 --> 01:10:57,599
Rym: this.".

1295
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,920
Scott: Because what happened was, the annex where all the tabletop gaming was going on, it had people the whole weekend.

1296
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:08,280
Scott: But there were always plenty of open tables, and we figured we could just go over there and get some.

1297
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:13,400
Scott: After our panel, it just happened to be the exact moment when every single table was full.

1298
01:11:14,141 --> 01:11:15,160
Scott: It just happened to be that time.

1299
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:23,820
Rym: So we get in our three ragged gangs of ruffians to the annex, and we've lost about 40 people along the way.

1300
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:32,900
Rym: But we still have a very large and very eager crowd, and we discover that there aren't any free tables, and it's just a giant clusterfuck.

1301
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:40,999
Rym: So, while we're trying to figure out what to do, a Penny Arcade Enforcer walks over and says, "Alright guys, what do you

1302
01:11:41,059 --> 01:11:41,319
Rym: need?".

1303
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:42,320
Scott: Yeah.

1304
01:11:42,941 --> 01:11:55,580
Rym: And one thing led to another, and basically, the Penny Arcade Expo and the Penny Arcade Enforcers went above and beyond anything I have ever experienced at any convention ever.

1305
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:59,558
Scott: Yeah, most conventions, they'd be like, "What are you doing with this crowd trying to make some shit

1306
01:11:59,598 --> 01:11:59,940
Scott: happen?".

1307
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,714
Rym: Or they'd be saying, "What are you doing?

1308
01:12:02,734 --> 01:12:03,638
Rym: This is a fire

1309
01:12:03,658 --> 01:12:03,920
Rym: hazard.".

1310
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:07,596
Rym: Or, most cons would be saying, "I don't know what to

1311
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:07,918
Rym: do.".

1312
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,494
Rym: Basically, all these PAX Enforcers converged, discussed, spread out.

1313
01:12:13,956 --> 01:12:15,019
Rym: The next thing we know...

1314
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:19,120
Scott: They have us tables, and they gave us the Serpent Theater, which was no longer in use that night.

1315
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:29,880
Rym: They gave us the Serpent Theater, they set up two demo tables on there, they set up the microphones, they set up crowd control, they set up line control.

1316
01:12:30,321 --> 01:12:36,039
Rym: They announced, they did everything we could have possibly asked, they did things I didn't even think of.

1317
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:42,797
Rym: And three of these Enforcers hung around until our event, which went on until about 1.30 in the morning, ended.

1318
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:44,597
Rym: Yep.

1319
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,700
Rym: This was hours and hours of maintaining a crowd that they did not expect, that we pulled out of the ether.

1320
01:12:51,421 --> 01:12:54,699
Rym: Oh my god, PAX, are you, like, I could hug all of you.

1321
01:12:55,041 --> 01:13:00,880
Scott: So basically what went down, right, is not everyone could play Burning Wheel demos all at once, and we couldn't run that many at once.

1322
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:07,980
Scott: 'Cause Luke Crane didn't expect that much of a crowd, we didn't bring enough materials, there weren't enough, you know, it was pretty much, oh god.

1323
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:13,759
Rym: So one, on the stage, Luke Crane and this other guy start demoing Burning Wheel, and while he's going...

1324
01:13:14,021 --> 01:13:15,099
Scott: That's eight people at a time.

1325
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:19,779
Rym: I go up to Luke behind him, and I'm like, "All right, Luke, how many demos can you

1326
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:19,920
Rym: do?".

1327
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,293
Rym: And he said, "How long is this room

1328
01:13:21,374 --> 01:13:21,576
Rym: open?".

1329
01:13:22,705 --> 01:13:24,458
Rym: And I said, "The room closes at, like,

1330
01:13:24,498 --> 01:13:24,639
Rym: two.".

1331
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,776
Rym: And he said, "I'll do demos until they kick me

1332
01:13:26,937 --> 01:13:27,018
Rym: out.".

1333
01:13:27,381 --> 01:13:29,737
Rym: And I said, "All right, are you

1334
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:30,100
Rym: sure?".

1335
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:31,515
Rym: And he said, "Yeah, of course I'm

1336
01:13:31,555 --> 01:13:31,697
Rym: sure.".

1337
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:41,300
Rym: So I run around this room, getting people to sign up for Burning Wheel demos, and oh my god, the number of people who wanted to demo, like, it was frightening.

1338
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:48,820
Rym: I had, like, two pieces of paper full of names, grouped up into groups of four, and, like, the groups had names, and it was crazy.

1339
01:13:49,503 --> 01:13:53,720
Rym: And Luke Crane stayed until everyone who wanted a Burning Wheel demo got a Burning Wheel demo.

1340
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,540
Scott: Or left before their time came.

1341
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:00,060
Rym: Yes, which was justifiable, because there was a large crowd, and it took forever.

1342
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:05,800
Scott: But, in order to get people to not be bored while waiting, Jared Sorenson did something amazing.

1343
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,400
Scott: He played Action Castle.

1344
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:13,418
Rym: Well, first he comes over to me and says, "I can entertain the

1345
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:13,740
Rym: crowd.".

1346
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:14,736
Rym: And I said, "What are you gonna

1347
01:14:14,777 --> 01:14:14,838
Rym: do?".

1348
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:15,986
Rym: And I said, "Can I have a

1349
01:14:16,047 --> 01:14:16,489
Rym: microphone?".

1350
01:14:18,362 --> 01:14:19,520
Rym: And the attention of the crowd.

1351
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,756
Rym: And we said, "Yeah, we can do

1352
01:14:21,796 --> 01:14:21,958
Rym: that.".

1353
01:14:22,422 --> 01:14:24,180
Rym: And he got another microphone.

1354
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,320
Rym: Again, Pax Enforcers, oh my god.

1355
01:14:26,761 --> 01:14:28,040
Rym: He stood there with a microphone.

1356
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,780
Rym: Pax Enforcers set up a line, and at the front of this line was a microphone.

1357
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:35,960
Rym: And he ran Action Castle.

1358
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,740
Rym: I don't know if I want to get into what Action Castle was, I feel like I should dedicate, because we're running out of time here tonight.

1359
01:14:42,862 --> 01:14:46,740
Rym: I should dedicate a whole bit on another Tuesday about what Action Castle is.

1360
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:50,279
Scott: Could we play Action Castle online, with some webcams or streaming or something?

1361
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,500
Rym: We will figure this out, and we will talk again.

1362
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,306
Rym: Let me tell you this.

1363
01:14:54,233 --> 01:14:55,080
Rym: I had a revelation.

1364
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:58,619
Rym: Action Castle, I'm going to memorize it or something like it.

1365
01:14:59,241 --> 01:15:00,940
Scott: We should make up a different one.

1366
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:06,925
Scott: We should make, like, Daring Dungeon, or Action Castle 2.

1367
01:15:06,925 --> 01:15:07,660
Rym: I will summarize.

1368
01:15:08,281 --> 01:15:15,413
Rym: The crowd loved it, and this is now what I'm going to do to entertain a crowd.

1369
01:15:15,774 --> 01:15:19,500
Rym: anytime I'm at a convention with an unruly crowd to entertain.

1370
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:25,280
Rym: This is going to be, if I can pull it off, the official Keep a Line or Keep a Crowd Busy event.

1371
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,860
Rym: Hell, you could run this as an event at a con, and it would be amazing.

1372
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,239
Scott: Trademark Jared Sorenson.

1373
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,600
Rym: Yes, Jared Sorenson is the freaking man.

1374
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:35,960
Scott: Unless he got it from someone else, in which case, I don't know.

1375
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:41,580
Rym: Regardless, Jared Sorenson, we're going to have an interview with him as soon as we have time to put it together.

1376
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:51,880
Scott: So, after all that, it was still Saturday, the con was still rocking, and what do you do at a con that's PAX if it's Friday or Saturday night?

1377
01:15:52,201 --> 01:15:54,100
Rym: You go to the motherfucking concert.

1378
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:57,500
Scott: You go to five hours of the best concerts at any convention in the United States.

1379
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,437
Rym: After we left them to be, we said, "Alright, we're going to go to the

1380
01:16:00,477 --> 01:16:00,839
Rym: concert.".

1381
01:16:01,101 --> 01:16:02,647
Rym: And we said, "Aw, crap.

1382
01:16:02,827 --> 01:16:03,470
Rym: Wristbands.

1383
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:05,016
Rym: What if this concert's overflowing?

1384
01:16:05,056 --> 01:16:05,337
Rym: What do we

1385
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:05,498
Rym: do?".

1386
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:10,520
Rym: And a PAX enforcer walked over and handed us wristbands.

1387
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,080
Scott: Well, I think some of our listeners gave us wristbands also.

1388
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,560
Rym: Yes, we actually had, like, five wristbands as a result.

1389
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,158
Scott: People came through and gave us wristbands, which is awesome.

1390
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:23,700
Rym: Like, one PAX enforcer gave me the crumpled up one that he took off himself.

1391
01:16:24,181 --> 01:16:28,759
Rym: Another PAX enforcer gave me an un-put-on one, a brand new one.

1392
01:16:29,446 --> 01:16:30,759
Rym: And listeners gave us some.

1393
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:40,200
Rym: So thus on, we walked over to the concert, and once again, at PAX, you can pretty much just walk into any concert after it starts.

1394
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:41,165
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

1395
01:16:41,225 --> 01:16:43,160
Scott: You don't have to worry about getting the wristbands.

1396
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,859
Scott: If you want to see the concert, you'll see it.

1397
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:50,280
Scott: Even with that many people, even without you're going to see the concert, don't worry about it.

1398
01:16:50,461 --> 01:16:51,538
Scott: And we said that last time.

1399
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:58,040
Rym: The secret, walk into the room, walk all the way around the back, all the way to the left, and then scooch in, and you'll be, like, right up front.

1400
01:16:58,402 --> 01:17:01,779
Scott: Yeah, at least, you know, if PAX is still in the same room layout next time.

1401
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:08,400
Rym: Now, as you know, the previous night's concert was almost worth the price of admission in and of itself.

1402
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:16,160
Rym: In fact, it probably was worth the price of admission in and of itself, considering what I've paid for other less satisfying concerts in my life.

1403
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:22,860
Rym: But I was real excited about this one, because I had never heard two of these bands at all.

1404
01:17:23,582 --> 01:17:26,579
Rym: And I was a huge fan of the other two acts.

1405
01:17:27,462 --> 01:17:33,080
Scott: Yeah, so it's like, well, I love two of these, and I don't know two of these.

1406
01:17:34,141 --> 01:17:36,240
Scott: Alright, at the worst, it's half awesome.

1407
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:39,820
Rym: So we wander into the beginning of Anamanaguchi.

1408
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:41,960
Scott: Is that how you pronounce it?

1409
01:17:42,162 --> 01:17:42,495
Rym: I don't know.

1410
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,239
Scott: Basically, these guys were no older than we were.

1411
01:17:45,841 --> 01:17:49,400
Scott: And they did the typical rock out video game music thing.

1412
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,118
Scott: You know, that was done by such bands as Arm, Canon, Entertainment System, etc, etc, etc.

1413
01:17:55,682 --> 01:17:59,380
Scott: And they were pretty much right in line with that, and just as good as all the other ones.

1414
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:00,974
Rym: Yeah, the crowd got really into it.

1415
01:18:00,994 --> 01:18:01,580
Rym: It was really fun.

1416
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:04,516
Rym: I don't have much more to say, but you guys rule, and it was a good show.

1417
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:11,060
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't sitting there going, "Oh, get off the stage," which means good concert.

1418
01:18:12,981 --> 01:18:20,320
Rym: But while that was well and good, then comes forth from the darkness, the darkest of the hillside thickets.

1419
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:26,537
Scott: Now, the name of the band is, quote, "The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets,".

1420
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:27,680
Scott: end of name.

1421
01:18:28,361 --> 01:18:29,886
Rym: I'm not going to mince words.

1422
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:34,000
Rym: They are a Lovecraftian-themed metal band.

1423
01:18:35,063 --> 01:18:36,859
Scott: You really don't need to say more than that, do you?

1424
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:38,824
Rym: They're old.

1425
01:18:38,925 --> 01:18:40,270
Rym: They've been around for a while.

1426
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:42,700
Rym: They've been performing since like Necro Wombicon.

1427
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,347
Scott: Yeah, they played a lot.

1428
01:18:44,367 --> 01:18:45,955
Scott: They're an old, old band.

1429
01:18:45,995 --> 01:18:46,860
Scott: They've been around.

1430
01:18:47,282 --> 01:18:49,800
Scott: I've been around for a long time, and I've never heard of them until now.

1431
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,519
Scott: I don't know why I've never heard from them until now.

1432
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,738
Rym: You know, a lot of times, someone says, "Oh, we're a concept band," or, "We're a

1433
01:18:55,778 --> 01:18:56,100
Rym: Lovecraft.".

1434
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,285
Rym: You know, something funny like that.

1435
01:18:57,687 --> 01:18:59,777
Rym: It's usually like, "Yeah, the concept's cool, but the band's kind of

1436
01:18:59,797 --> 01:18:59,978
Rym: mad.".

1437
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:03,780
Rym: The band is super awesome, independent of their theme.

1438
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,960
Rym: They fucking rock the shit.

1439
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,507
Rym: They put on a great show.

1440
01:19:09,571 --> 01:19:10,835
Rym: They did the whole metal.

1441
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:12,580
Rym: They were dressed in these costumes.

1442
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:13,866
Rym: Look online.

1443
01:19:14,127 --> 01:19:15,899
Rym: You can find some video of their act.

1444
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:23,476
Scott: Yeah, if you are a Lovecraft fan or a metal fan, or hopefully both, how could you not?

1445
01:19:24,078 --> 01:19:25,080
Scott: How could you not?

1446
01:19:25,501 --> 01:19:29,612
Rym: The level of energy that the lead singer put forth, and the lyrics.

1447
01:19:30,114 --> 01:19:30,816
Rym: Oh, the lyrics.

1448
01:19:31,056 --> 01:19:32,320
Rym: The crowd's screaming.

1449
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:34,585
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

1450
01:19:34,605 --> 01:19:35,591
Rym: I can't even.

1451
01:19:35,652 --> 01:19:36,759
Rym: I can't express it here.

1452
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,624
Scott: Oh, that was the greatest.

1453
01:19:37,684 --> 01:19:39,433
Scott: Everyone was going, "Yeah, yeah.

1454
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:39,975
Rym: Get through the

1455
01:19:39,995 --> 01:19:40,659
Rym: photography.".

1456
01:19:40,961 --> 01:19:41,991
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

1457
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:42,820
Rym: Get through the photography.

1458
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:43,859
Scott: Oh, that's good stuff.

1459
01:19:45,563 --> 01:19:48,471
Rym: Basically, the concert on Saturday.

1460
01:19:48,491 --> 01:19:58,940
Rym: If the concert on Friday was just a really good concert, the concert on Saturday, one thing I can say is that the level of energy in the room escalated and escalated and escalated.

1461
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:00,003
Scott: I mean, Friday.

1462
01:20:00,023 --> 01:20:05,060
Scott: Remember, Friday was fucking Jonathan Golden and such, and Freeze Pop.

1463
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,540
Scott: Super, super energy amazing.

1464
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:16,780
Scott: Somehow, even though I guess the star power of Saturday was a tiny bit less, the rocking was twice as hard.

1465
01:20:17,141 --> 01:20:18,667
Scott: I don't know how that could be, but it was.

1466
01:20:18,888 --> 01:20:20,837
Scott: Maybe it's because we were closer into the stage.

1467
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:21,620
Scott: I don't know what it was.

1468
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:26,040
Rym: Now, this is the concert I really want to talk about, because I liked MC Frontalot.

1469
01:20:26,664 --> 01:20:27,510
Rym: I love Nerdcore.

1470
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:28,780
Rym: I've always liked MC Frontalot.

1471
01:20:29,401 --> 01:20:32,580
Scott: Actually, this is the second time I had seen MC Frontalot live.

1472
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,120
Rym: See, I've only seen him live once.

1473
01:20:34,461 --> 01:20:42,860
Scott: Me and Emily actually went to these digital life things they have in the Javits Center that I always get into for free, because I refuse to pay for it.

1474
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:48,080
Scott: It's basically walk around a room in the Javits where a bunch of tech companies have crap set up and whatever.

1475
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:50,019
Scott: A lot of gaming action going on.

1476
01:20:51,022 --> 01:20:54,360
Scott: One of them, we happened to show up during MC Frontalot set.

1477
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:59,720
Scott: It was really sad, because he was playing to all these empty seats and five kids sitting there.

1478
01:21:00,302 --> 01:21:04,359
Scott: He was way into his show, trying real hard, but there was no one there.

1479
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:06,820
Scott: It was like the Javits at a trade show.

1480
01:21:07,141 --> 01:21:08,260
Rym: At least when I went and saw MC Chris.

1481
01:21:08,521 --> 01:21:12,438
Scott: I felt really bad for him, but I was like, "Oh, that's MC Frontalot, the bald dude.

1482
01:21:12,478 --> 01:21:12,598
Scott: All

1483
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:12,799
Scott: right.".

1484
01:21:14,684 --> 01:21:22,060
Rym: I liked his music, and I liked this sort of thing, but seeing him in concert adds this whole new dimension to his music.

1485
01:21:22,762 --> 01:21:25,820
Rym: You want to talk about a performer who is into what he is doing?

1486
01:21:26,362 --> 01:21:31,620
Rym: The level of energy on that stage was powerful, almost painful.

1487
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,807
Rym: The man is intense.

1488
01:21:34,088 --> 01:21:35,493
Rym: He is almost frightening.

1489
01:21:35,513 --> 01:21:37,460
Rym: It was fantastic.

1490
01:21:39,642 --> 01:21:42,773
Rym: And he did pretty much all his headlining songs.

1491
01:21:43,014 --> 01:21:44,560
Rym: The crowd was losing their shit.

1492
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,329
Rym: Everyone was singing along with him.

1493
01:21:46,349 --> 01:21:47,757
Rym: He was just intense.

1494
01:21:47,797 --> 01:21:48,300
Rym: It was great.

1495
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,359
Rym: I guess Scott's got nothing to say about MC Frontalot.

1496
01:21:51,822 --> 01:21:56,120
Scott: There's no words, because the amazingness was so, so off the charts.

1497
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,866
Scott: What can you possibly say?

1498
01:21:58,449 --> 01:22:00,620
Scott: And that's not even counting, right?

1499
01:22:00,801 --> 01:22:01,879
Scott: I got nothing to say about that.

1500
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:06,639
Scott: What can I possibly say about when he brought Joko out to play with him?

1501
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,700
Rym: Jonathan Colton and MC Frontalot doing a duet.

1502
01:22:12,942 --> 01:22:16,460
Rym: This was, I don't know, amazing, spectacular.

1503
01:22:18,062 --> 01:22:23,791
Scott: And then after he, you know, they had a song that they played together, which actually is a song no one's ever heard before.

1504
01:22:26,761 --> 01:22:27,848
Scott: I went and listened to it again.

1505
01:22:27,868 --> 01:22:29,920
Scott: I liked that song a lot.

1506
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,260
Rym: I also like that song.

1507
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,266
Scott: Like way too much.

1508
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:34,860
Scott: We should link to the song, maybe.

1509
01:22:35,064 --> 01:22:35,500
Rym: Yeah, we should.

1510
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:41,260
Scott: And then Jonathan Colton hung around and played the drum for the last song.

1511
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:42,278
Scott: He just played one drum.

1512
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:43,745
Rym: Man, I love that dude.

1513
01:22:44,268 --> 01:22:46,180
Rym: Now, MC Frontalot was amazing.

1514
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,700
Rym: The energy level in the room, like the crowd was really freaking worked up at this point.

1515
01:22:51,021 --> 01:22:59,280
Rym: And then, of course, like with every concert at PAX, we went through the charade of Go Away, Come Back Encore, and MC Frontalot's Encore, the fucking bomb.

1516
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:03,220
Rym: But then the minibosses came out.

1517
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,607
Scott: Now, the minibosses, right?

1518
01:23:04,627 --> 01:23:07,120
Scott: They're a band that I've known about for a long time.

1519
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:07,959
Rym: They're an old standby.

1520
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:08,950
Scott: Like since the year 2000, right?

1521
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:13,119
Scott: In the year 2000, I got to RIT, I discovered the minibosses.

1522
01:23:13,441 --> 01:23:16,960
Scott: People who played video game music, but they rocked out.

1523
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:19,019
Scott: They did the Mega Man and the Punch Out and all the goods.

1524
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,780
Rym: Now, a lot of people play video game music.

1525
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:31,940
Rym: I mean, the Anna Manigucci and all these bands, but the minibosses bring something a little different to the table in that the songs they play are not crazy interpretations.

1526
01:23:32,162 --> 01:23:33,940
Rym: They're not musical interpretations.

1527
01:23:34,061 --> 01:23:42,320
Rym: They're pretty much the truest to the original source material as you can possibly be while still performing something live.

1528
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,055
Rym: And they're fantastic.

1529
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:51,540
Rym: They're so true, and they sound so good and so nostalgic.

1530
01:23:51,880 --> 01:24:03,380
Scott: This is a band that I had known about and listened to for a very long time, always wanted to see live, never had a chance to, and they weren't super uber popular, so I didn't think they would be around that long.

1531
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:08,100
Scott: But they do packs every year, I think, and they rock the packs every year.

1532
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,940
Scott: And you can tell, because they came out acting like this is something they do every night.

1533
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:12,752
Scott: They're like, "Hey, guys, what's

1534
01:24:12,894 --> 01:24:12,955
Scott: up?".

1535
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:14,855
Rym: "We're going to do some Mega Man for

1536
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:15,158
Rym: y'all.".

1537
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:17,573
Scott: "I think they want

1538
01:24:17,593 --> 01:24:18,139
Scott: Excitebike.".

1539
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:18,935
Rym: "No, they want Mega

1540
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:19,098
Rym: Man.".

1541
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:19,694
Rym: "Well, should we

1542
01:24:19,735 --> 01:24:19,858
Rym: play?".

1543
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,136
Scott: "Ah, fuck it, let's just play

1544
01:24:21,157 --> 01:24:21,280
Scott: this.".

1545
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:24,240
Scott: Every other band had their thing planned out and scheduled.

1546
01:24:24,502 --> 01:24:25,440
Scott: It was serious business.

1547
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,600
Scott: They were like, "Yeah, we do this all the time.

1548
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,840
Scott: It's like our fifth packs, whatever.

1549
01:24:30,883 --> 01:24:31,714
Scott: What do you guys want to

1550
01:24:31,755 --> 01:24:31,978
Scott: hear?".

1551
01:24:32,322 --> 01:24:33,050
Scott: "All right, we'll do that

1552
01:24:33,171 --> 01:24:33,252
Scott: one.".

1553
01:24:34,585 --> 01:24:40,211
Scott: And they had a DS on the stage, and they're like, "Hey, you guys, pick to chat this DS and write down what you want us to

1554
01:24:40,272 --> 01:24:40,373
Scott: play.".

1555
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:42,780
Scott: And people did, and it was great.

1556
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,199
Rym: Of course, there were a lot of penises in there, too.

1557
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:47,538
Scott: There were quite a bunch of penises.

1558
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:57,120
Rym: But this is where... I mean, you might say we were kind of hesitating, because now we have to talk about our shameful, I guess, conclusion to Saturday.

1559
01:24:58,025 --> 01:25:00,600
Rym: This is one of the most shameful things I've ever done.

1560
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,420
Rym: This is a sign of my age.

1561
01:25:02,601 --> 01:25:02,996
Rym: But you see...

1562
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:10,180
Scott: Well, the concerts on Saturday were... Remember, we went over there when they started, which was...

1563
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:24,460
Rym: Now, the concert is four hours long, from 9.30 to 1.30, and the doors to the con close at 3 a.m Right, so the concert is supposed to end at 1.30.

1564
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,419
Scott: Then we were going to go to bed.

1565
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:30,920
Scott: So at 9 o'clock, 9.30, we went over there, stayed there until 1.30.

1566
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,100
Rym: And I'm jumping up and down, and I'm headbanging.

1567
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,299
Rym: I'm throwing up the horns.

1568
01:25:35,402 --> 01:25:37,840
Rym: I'm basically losing my shit and jumping around and pogoing.

1569
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,360
Scott: This is right after doing a panel, right?

1570
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,420
Scott: This is right after doing all that crazy stuff in the Serpent Theatre.

1571
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:45,920
Scott: This is right after a whole lot of action.

1572
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:47,260
Rym: This is after Friday!

1573
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:51,000
Scott: We were standing up the entire time during this concert, right?

1574
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,337
Scott: And every band during the entire concert, every single one, had one or two encores.

1575
01:25:57,521 --> 01:25:58,139
Scott: It was a shtick.

1576
01:25:58,982 --> 01:26:00,300
Scott: Just everyone did them, right?

1577
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:00,962
Scott: M.C.

1578
01:26:01,023 --> 01:26:05,940
Scott: Prodlot even came out, and he was like... He came out for his encore right away, pretty much, leaving no suspense.

1579
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,840
Scott: And he's like, "Oh, what gave it away?

1580
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:11,316
Scott: The large number of encores already performed at concerts this

1581
01:26:11,336 --> 01:26:11,718
Scott: weekend?".

1582
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:15,969
Rym: So I'm headbanging to the 11th or 12th song of the minibosses.

1583
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:22,180
Rym: And I start to lose it.

1584
01:26:22,301 --> 01:26:23,055
Rym: I feel like, "Wait a

1585
01:26:23,075 --> 01:26:23,279
Rym: minute.".

1586
01:26:23,401 --> 01:26:24,752
Scott: It's like 2.30 in the morning.

1587
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:27,739
Rym: I don't even know what time it is.

1588
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:30,879
Rym: I'm thinking, "Whoa, I'm having an old man moment here.

1589
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:32,939
Rym: I gotta go to bed.

1590
01:26:33,544 --> 01:26:33,812
Rym: Oh my

1591
01:26:33,874 --> 01:26:34,080
Rym: god.".

1592
01:26:34,241 --> 01:26:35,917
Rym: So I'm like, "Alright, the concert's gotta end

1593
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:36,159
Rym: soon.".

1594
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:40,100
Rym: And I look at my cell phone, and it says 2.30.

1595
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,780
Rym: And I look at Scott, and I point at it.

1596
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:42,083
Rym: He's like,

1597
01:26:42,103 --> 01:26:42,732
Rym: "Ugh.".

1598
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,532
Rym: And neither one of us wanted to admit that we were losing it.

1599
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,480
Scott: I could've stayed there the whole time.

1600
01:26:48,581 --> 01:26:49,099
Scott: I could've.

1601
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:55,860
Scott: But really, I was in such a state where my brain wasn't processing the music fully.

1602
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,600
Scott: I was not getting out of it what I should've been.

1603
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,800
Rym: And at this point, we realized they're not stopping.

1604
01:27:02,262 --> 01:27:05,580
Scott: Yeah, they weren't acting like they're wrapping it up soon.

1605
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,779
Scott: It was like they acted.

1606
01:27:07,582 --> 01:27:09,977
Scott: Their demeanor was like, "We're in the middle.

1607
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:10,950
Scott: We're in

1608
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:11,075
Scott: this.".

1609
01:27:11,342 --> 01:27:12,338
Scott: We didn't even start yet.

1610
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,818
Rym: We were playing until you were kicked out with us.

1611
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:15,456
Scott: Yeah.

1612
01:27:16,943 --> 01:27:31,140
Rym: So, many times in my life, at anime conventions, at gaming conventions, at a Linux convention, at concerts, I have made the decision to leave an event, to leave a concert before it ended.

1613
01:27:31,604 --> 01:27:33,560
Rym: And it's usually an informed decision.

1614
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:45,139
Rym: It is the decision of, while I could stay, I'm going to sacrifice the last hour, or last half hour, or last whatever, of this event in order to sleep so that I can do more the next day.

1615
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,480
Rym: Like, it was always a decision, and I could've stayed.

1616
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,061
Rym: At 2.32

1617
01:27:49,061 --> 01:27:49,923
Rym: a.m.,

1618
01:27:50,043 --> 01:28:01,840
Rym: well, I guess on Sunday morning, at the Penny Arcade Expo 2008, in the middle of the minibosses concert, I realized I could not go on.

1619
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:05,600
Rym: I realized that I could not stay to the end.

1620
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:09,900
Rym: I would've had to go to the back of the room and sit down and possibly fall asleep.

1621
01:28:10,361 --> 01:28:13,440
Rym: For the first time in my life, I was defeated.

1622
01:28:14,201 --> 01:28:15,660
Rym: This has never happened to me before.

1623
01:28:16,943 --> 01:28:19,619
Rym: I felt like I was a thousand years old.

1624
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:24,699
Rym: And as I walked out of the room with Scott, and there were a handful of other people.

1625
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:28,519
Scott: I just stayed, but Rym wanted to leave, and then I just sort of acquiesced.

1626
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:35,286
Rym: Yes, basically, it's not like Scott was the trooper saying, "Man, Rym, fuck you, but we should

1627
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:35,513
Rym: go.".

1628
01:28:35,861 --> 01:28:39,517
Rym: Scott was like, "It's kind of like the Jenga that's teetering, teetering, teetering,

1629
01:28:39,537 --> 01:28:39,899
Rym: teetering.".

1630
01:28:40,241 --> 01:28:43,180
Rym: And I looked at it, and I went, and it fell right over.

1631
01:28:43,941 --> 01:28:50,439
Rym: So we walk out, this walk of shame, and as I look back, the energy of the room has not diminished at all.

1632
01:28:51,263 --> 01:28:53,437
Rym: I am just older than I used to be.

1633
01:28:54,323 --> 01:28:57,660
Scott: Even though the average age of PAX is more our age than young punk kids.

1634
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:06,840
Rym: But at the same time, as I walked out, I saw other people our age, and I saw one person who I'm pretty sure was younger than me, also on their way out.

1635
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:11,415
Scott: Also, I point out, they have, one good thing about PAX is that the concerts are general admission.

1636
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,540
Scott: If people don't realize this because they don't go to concerts and you're a bunch of nerds, I know some of you, right?

1637
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:18,260
Rym: Yes, there are no chairs except in the very back.

1638
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:18,880
Scott: Exactly.

1639
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:29,079
Scott: General admission just means it's the floor in front of the stage, and you walk out there, and you can just walk around except where there's people already standing, and then you can't walk there because of the laws of physics.

1640
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,340
Scott: Seating means seats, right?

1641
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:37,029
Scott: Well, at Otakon and such, the concerts have seats right up to the front, and it's sort of black.

1642
01:29:37,049 --> 01:29:37,740
Scott: because what can you do?

1643
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:43,279
Scott: You stand up in front of your seat and you dance, and you sit down and you can't see, and then you stand up in front of your seat and you dance a little bit.

1644
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,540
Scott: General admission is what concerts are about.

1645
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:50,760
Scott: If your concert doesn't have general admission, that ruins even the best band in the world.

1646
01:29:51,061 --> 01:29:52,019
Scott: It kind of sucks.

1647
01:29:53,843 --> 01:30:04,680
Scott: Basically, at PAX, they have general admission, but they have seats in the back of the room, like two rows of seats in the way back, so you can sit if you want, and it works out.

1648
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:07,680
Scott: Most of the time, those seats are about half full.

1649
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,227
Scott: When I walked out of that room at 2.30

1650
01:30:10,227 --> 01:30:10,508
Scott: a.m.,

1651
01:30:10,689 --> 01:30:13,710
Scott: the seats were 100% full, 100%.

1652
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:13,918
Rym: Yes.

1653
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:45,020
Rym: Now, seeing that and seeing other people who also left the concert before 3 in the goddamn morning, I felt a little bit younger, but I still felt like I was 100 years old, and when I go back to that hotel room and I fell immediately to sleep, I mean immediately, like, I literally, like, laid down and I woke up, and it was the next day, and it was time to go back to the con, but I have never felt as old in my life as I felt walking out of the end of that concert.

1654
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:46,238
Rym: I was defeated.

1655
01:30:48,386 --> 01:30:51,000
Scott: And I think at that point- Now, that's the end of Saturday at PAX.

1656
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,180
Rym: Thus, Saturday.

1657
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:55,020
Rym: I'll at least say this.

1658
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:58,860
Rym: We're not going to do an entire dedicated Tuesday to Sunday.

1659
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:04,500
Rym: We're going to talk about some other stuff the next time we talk about PAX, but- Next time we have a Tuesday episode.

1660
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,220
Rym: I think our coverage of PAX is going to be three nights long.

1661
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:11,800
Rym: There's no way to avoid it because I have a lot to say about what happened on Sunday.

1662
01:31:12,282 --> 01:31:13,000
Rym: I'm kind of excited.

1663
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,700
Rym: I want to talk about it now, but we've been going a while.

1664
01:31:22,186 --> 01:31:24,260
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1665
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,900
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1666
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:38,760
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com, where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

1667
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:45,040
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week, covering four different brands of geekery.

1668
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:47,140
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1669
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,720
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1670
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:55,618
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1671
01:31:56,260 --> 01:32:04,180
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com, or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1672
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,720
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

1673
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:13,177
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

1674
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,580

Scott: This means you can do whatever you want with it, as long as you give us credit, don't make money, and share it in kind.

1677
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:34,020
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1678
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:37,580
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
