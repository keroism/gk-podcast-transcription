1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,277
Rym: It's Monday April 7th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,820
Rym: tonight We finish out the IT CS alternating bits with network monitoring.

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Rym: Let's do this.

4
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:37,660
Rym: So for various reasons today, this isn't my opening vid my anecdote It's Emily's but I think it was good because you know she stayed home.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:48,000
Rym: So she wanted some food and instead of driving to the nearest grocery store, which is actually pretty far away She went to the local grocery store, which is the one that's the bullshit grocery store.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:59,073
Rym: That's the problem because it has all the great kind of hippie food that I like but interspersed with all that nice hippie food is Homeopathy and fake medicine and just Randy bullshit left and right.

7
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:01,040
Scott: Why do they have to have the two things associated?

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,980
Scott: We should just open up a grocery store, right and we don't say like Organic or whatever or any bullshit like that.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,840
Scott: We just say look this food is exactly the same as that of the food except because it was grown somewhere near here.

10
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,583
Scott: It tastes better.

11
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:14,266
Scott: That's all.

12
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,491
Scott: that's the only advantage.

13
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:17,500
Rym: really well also they can't just in general.

14
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,771
Rym: They carry things like real root beer.

15
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:27,686
Rym: No grocery store here has real root beer But that place has like ten different kinds of say like, you know Organic fancy pants.

16
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:29,193
Scott: make your life healthier root beer.

17
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:30,480
Scott: We'll say look, this is root beer.

18
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:33,820
Scott: It costs more but it's made with real sugar and it tastes better.

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,180
Rym: I don't think they make any claims about the root beer at that place.

20
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,840
Scott: It's not so much exact claims written in text, but it's the marketing of it.

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,044
Scott: You know, it's.

22
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,537
Rym: I don't think root beer has ever been marketed as good for you in any way.

23
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:47,607
Scott: Oh That's a root beer.

24
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:48,794
Scott: people have something to say to you.

25
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:49,740
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,295
Rym: I am a root beer person as much as I like my dr.

27
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:52,657
Rym: Pepper.

28
00:01:52,717 --> 00:02:00,246
Rym: deep down I'm a root beer man, and I can tell you next time we have the Visigoths over to play some burning wheel I have a root beer keg.

29
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:07,880
Scott: Yeah, you know, I don't drink sodas and carbonated things But I've had root beer dum-dums and those are actually my favorite dum-dums.

30
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:12,440
Scott: You know, you might really like if I were to drink a a a beverage like that.

31
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,799
Scott: I think root beer might be my thing.

32
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:19,715
Rym: You could always get the root beer and put it on ice and then it won't be carbonated anymore And then it just tastes like a dum-dum.

33
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:22,447
Scott: But they would be flat.

34
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:24,352
Scott: then wanna be bleh if it's flat.

35
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:27,885
Rym: Well, it's flat, but you don't like the don flat Yeah, but ugly.

36
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,860
Scott: but at the same time if you take away the bubbles, doesn't that alter the flavor?

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,788
Rym: No, it's more than we like the bubbles.

38
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,920
Rym: That's just people like the bubbles.

39
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:39,312
Scott: I mean, that's sort of like, you know If you like stale bread better than like.

40
00:02:39,353 --> 00:02:41,987
Scott: if I don't like a loaf of bread I'm not gonna let it go stale.

41
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:46,147
Rym: and then you might because a dum-dum is just stale root beer I know but I'm saying is like.

42
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:48,760
Scott: let's say there's a loaf of bread, right and it's a kind of bread.

43
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,772
Scott: I don't like some weird like bread with all sorts of like fish in it or something I don't know sort of fish bread.

44
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:55,215
Rym: You know what?

45
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:56,100
Rym: I wouldn't mind a fish bread.

46
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,755
Scott: I'm just kind of good and that you know, and then the bread goes stale.

47
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:01,542
Scott: I'm not suddenly gonna like it It's got.

48
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,325
Rym: it's the opposite.

49
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:05,577
Rym: You're one of those people who ate some stale fish fish bread.

50
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:06,079
Rym: You're like hot.

51
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,520
Rym: damn I like the stale fish bread.

52
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:09,107
Rym: Hey, I wonder if I can.

53
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,539
Rym: if I like the real fish bread then you try it, you know like it.

54
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:12,792
Rym: That's what happened to you.

55
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:15,560
Rym: We can do some experiment.

56
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,291
Rym: Well, you can take a sip of root beer and then you can take a sip of flat root beer and then you can eat a dum-dum.

57
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:27,220
Scott: Yeah, I think I'm actually just gonna avoid drinking the sugar water and keep my teeth high quality.

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,186
Rym: You know sugar water isn't what kills teeth.

59
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,533
Rym: not brushing them is what kills teeth.

60
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,556
Rym: also lemonade.

61
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:36,706
Scott: Yes It's just another form of sugar water.

62
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:39,696
Rym: no lemonade is the worst possible thing you can drink.

63
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:44,891
Rym: every dentist will tell you that Yeah destroys teeth faster than anything except maybe hydrofluoric acid.

64
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:45,252
Scott: Yeah.

65
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:47,599
Scott: Well, I mean lemonade's the worst but so it is bad.

66
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:49,620
Scott: Also, it's just not as bad.

67
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:58,619
Rym: But anyway, I have a love-hate relationship with this store as you might guess because I like half the stuff in there But I'm morally opposed to the other half of the stuff in there.

68
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,225
Rym: But there's a third factor.

69
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:03,578
Rym: the employees are all jackasses at least the ones I've interacted with.

70
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,240
Scott: Oh, really?

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,020
Scott: Yeah, ever interacted with the employees there?

72
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,640
Scott: I think only thing ever bought there was a head of lettuce and then I discovered the homeopathies.

73
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:18,159
Rym: but anyway Emily went there and she was buying some stuff and she saw in line in front of her Someone who was Randy times two.

74
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:25,400
Rym: So they had in their basket homeopathy and they even had asked some questions about like which homeopathy is better.

75
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:30,276
Rym: But they also had in their basket Ronnie book Ronnie Brooke Farms,

76
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,961
Scott: oh Now that the the farm that our friend warned us is not good That

77
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:43,037
Rym: is the farm Ronnie Brooke Farms that we've been warned by people in the know is like the most health violating farm out there and

78
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:45,999
Scott: I hope this doesn't get him in trouble.

79
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:48,629
Rym: Emily was thinking about saying something to this woman.

80
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,760
Rym: then she realized that perhaps one will punish the other.

81
00:04:56,181 --> 00:05:01,756
Rym: That's all I got because you have something much more interesting something the listeners are very very looking forward to.

82
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:02,578
Rym: I don't know why.

83
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:04,524
Scott: yes Uh, yeah, I don't know either.

84
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:08,335
Rym: Yeah, wait, we're gonna do what some sort of inside GeekNights.

85
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:09,719
Rym: how GeekNights is done?

86
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:15,520
Rym: Reminisce boxers Scott laying upside down on a chair mumbling now, so it's the audio podcasts.

87
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:20,280
Scott: You obviously like them you're listening to them, but they don't catch on so much.

88
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,990
Scott: Right, the big thing on the internet now is videos.

89
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:31,819
Scott: people like them videos and we thought about doing the videos But we didn't have video skills or equipment or the time because GeekNights used to take a lot of time for us to do.

90
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:33,290
Rym: Yeah, not so much anymore.

91
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:34,520
Scott: So we didn't have a camera.

92
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,818
Scott: I mean I had my normal photo digital camera that could take videos, but that's that's not gonna cut it.

93
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:44,380
Scott: So we've been thinking about a video camera, you know, we're like, oh which one do we get?

94
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:54,287
Scott: And I discovered this one that's coming out in a month or two And I thought we would go get it because it has like internal flash memory But also takes extra flash memory.

95
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:56,454
Scott: and I was like, oh that that sounds good to me.

96
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:57,819
Scott: that seems like it'll work for us.

97
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:06,380
Scott: But I also got a new credit card the second credit card I ever had in my life and I the old one is the Sony one right with all the points.

98
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:11,520
Scott: So I was like I need to get rid of these points, but absolutely nothing Sony makes is something I want.

99
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:16,501
Scott: I mean, I could have got a free ps2 or we could have gotten a GPS 3.

100
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:21,060
Scott: Yeah, but if I would have got a ps3, I wouldn't need an HDTV, which I wasn't gonna get.

101
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:24,150
Scott: Yeah, at least not until I get new house also at least one game.

102
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:32,580
Scott: Yeah, so it's like, uh now I'm thinking well I just get a Sony camera that was like, uh, but is the Sony camera gonna work with Linux and whatnot?

103
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:32,922
Scott: Is it?

104
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:34,414
Scott: you know, there are all these questions.

105
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,099
Scott: I said, you know what?

106
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:44,720
Scott: I looked I went to the Best Buy and I just got the cheapest Hard drive based Sony camera they had and I use the points on it.

107
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,328
Scott: So it's gonna cost almost nothing.

108
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:58,959
Rym: now our philosophy here is the same thing We did with GeekNights and if any of you ever have a creative endeavor in front of you This is what you should do when there's a capital purchase involved buy the cheapest whatever that works and use it.

109
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:04,918
Rym: You'll learn what things you need and don't need on the real one and you'll know what to buy later.

110
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:11,000
Rym: I mean we bought a crappy little mixer and then after a year of GeekNights like alright, I need another bus.

111
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,287
Rym: Goddamnit, do I need another bus?

112
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,457
Rym: So we bought a mixer with another bus.

113
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:20,260
Scott: Yep So I'm gonna use this cheap-ass camera, it's actually not too bad.

114
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,772
Scott: I mean, it's not HD, but it has a 30 gig hard drive in it.

115
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:24,495
Rym: YouTube's.

116
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:25,799
Rym: Yeah, we don't need HD.

117
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:34,976
Scott: So we're gonna make YouTube's and things and learn the video skills and hopefully our YouTube's will be good in some way I don't know.

118
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:38,951
Scott: also You know, I read that first prince of nothing book.

119
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:40,155
Scott: So I was trying to get the second one.

120
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:43,540
Scott: our Scott backer Amazon only has the third one.

121
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,060
Scott: They don't have the first of the second one, at least not in paperback and I have buy no hardback.

122
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:50,339
Scott: So I went to some bookstores and I couldn't find it.

123
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:53,450
Scott: You know what bookstore had all three of them in paperback?

124
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:01,820
Rym: the one in Grand Central the shitty one in Grand Central, you know I gotta admit as that place isn't actually nearly as overpriced as I expected it to be.

125
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,634
Scott: Well, no, it was cover price, but it was still that bookstore.

126
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:05,900
Scott: Usually I was like the worst election.

127
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,360
Scott: Meanwhile, I went to the sort of highbrow bookstore near my work and Soho, you know, it's all fancy.

128
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:25,265
Scott: They didn't have that book but they if you went to the graphic novel section it like every highbrow graphic novel like every single one like every will Eisner and everything vertical publishes and everything and I was like Ah, look at that.

129
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:26,311
Scott: I have all those books.

130
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:27,739
Scott: I don't need to buy any of the mirror, huh?

131
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,226
Rym: So I gotta ask one thing.

132
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:32,020
Rym: we'll talk about this in much more detail someday in the future.

133
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:41,342
Rym: but I've been kind of raving about the prince of nothing the darkness that comes before and Pretty much everyone has been trying to get Scott to read this book for a while They finally read it.

134
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:44,073
Rym: All I want to ask you Scott is is it a good book?

135
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:44,976
Scott: It's a good book.

136
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,500
Rym: I You should all read it seriously.

137
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:55,936
Scott: It wasn't like, you know So great that I should have dropped everything I was doing in read it like I don't know.

138
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:56,740
Rym: I'm so far.

139
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,406
Rym: It's one of the best books I've ever written.

140
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,232
Rym: read read not written.

141
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:01,316
Rym: I did not write it.

142
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:02,420
Scott: I don't know about that.

143
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:02,922
Scott: I mean, it's a.

144
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:05,694
Rym: it's a good book if you read what.

145
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:07,160
Rym: what better book is have you read?

146
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:13,760
Rym: I like name one.

147
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,585
Scott: Ha there's so many.

148
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:18,428
Rym: yeah, I'm sure.

149
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:21,259
Rym: could you name one doesn't have to be the top one, huh?

150
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:21,961
Scott: It's just.

151
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:22,583
Scott: there's so many.

152
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:24,350
Scott: it's hard to share American gods.

153
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,293
Scott: I think it's a better book.

154
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,000
Rym: you American gods is up there.

155
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:29,236
Rym: I don't think American God said as much.

156
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:33,113
Scott: he was a amazing Cavalier and clay is a better book.

157
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:34,000
Rym: I got to read that first.

158
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,295
Rym: I Know that there's not so many classics coming out of you.

159
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:45,183
Rym: yet here Hamlet is.

160
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:46,228
Scott: it's not a book.

161
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,112
Scott: It's it's the book.

162
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:48,760
Rym: It's also not that good.

163
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:51,978
Rym: I'm just saying I like Hamlet, but everyone likes Hamlet.

164
00:09:53,161 --> 00:10:00,694
Rym: Besides you know what I'm gonna say this reading Hamlet is all well and good But if you have not seen the Kenneth Branagh Hamlet, you do not know Hamlet.

165
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:00,915
Rym: Good.

166
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:01,176
Rym: God.

167
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:02,259
Rym: Is that the best Hamlet ever?

168
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:03,831
Scott: Cats cradles.

169
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:10,019
Rym: a better book All right all right anyway, so I got some news here.

170
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:13,716
Rym: This is news that was relevant to me back in the year 2000. give or take.

171
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:19,506
Rym: I don't think it'll be relevant to any of you, and if you think it's relevant well You're gonna learn why it's not.

172
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:22,620
Rym: so not everywhere in the United States does this.

173
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,951
Rym: But there's something called the Advanced Placement Board in the AP test.

174
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,740
Scott: Oh, I saw that news and the deal.

175
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:32,319
Rym: It amazes me how many people don't know that this is out there.

176
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:41,466
Rym: but basically what you can do in high school is you can pay like 70 bucks and take a test with these people and They give you a score from one to five.

177
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:44,255
Rym: one means you are dumbass.

178
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:45,659
Scott: really can you get lower than one?

179
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,107
Scott: No, everything wrong is a one.

180
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:50,255
Scott: Yes, the thing is I get one right.

181
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:50,616
Scott: do I get it?

182
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:51,339
Scott: do I get two?

183
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,107
Rym: I don't pretty much the way.

184
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:55,340
Rym: the way that I mean it's one through three four five.

185
00:10:55,902 --> 00:11:06,680
Rym: The way it actually works is a five means you know your shit and a four is like okay And a three is like yeah, you barely made it and a lot of colleges will accept three fours or fives.

186
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:26,003
Rym: but I say colleges because the way this works is you take the test and You get a score and they keep track of all your scores and then you submit these scores to whatever college or university you attend and Most pretty much any university worth a damn will give you credit college credit based on What classes you took.

187
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:33,530
Scott: so if you get a four on the AP calculus test and then you go to college and they have you Know they say oh you're gonna need.

188
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,353
Scott: you're a computer science student You need to take calculus classes in order to graduate.

189
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:37,976
Scott: you say oh, no.

190
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:42,339
Scott: No you say oh, no No, I got a four on the AP calculus test you were going to make it.

191
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:46,100
Scott: You're going to give me credit for those calculus classes, so I don't have to pay you for them.

192
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,960
Rym: I already already know that now different colleges have different requirements.

193
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:58,540
Rym: I mean so like if you're going in like if you're going into say Biology like you want to go pre-med you better have gotten a four or five on that AP biology tester.

194
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,416
Rym: They're not gonna count it.

195
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:08,755
Rym: Yeah But if you're going into computer science they'll probably take the three and let you not have to take a class even though I don't think they should because the three basically means you didn't really know your stuff.

196
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:09,338
Scott: Well.

197
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:22,586
Rym: It's like a see It's like normal you knew, but you didn't know really well Yeah But I got a three on the AP music theory test And I I'll admit openly that I knew jack all about music theory And I guessed almost every quest.

198
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:23,409
Scott: but you're not a moron.

199
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,840
Rym: Yeah, it's anyway, so these things are great.

200
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,560
Scott: Well, I think that is in multiple choice.

201
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:34,738
Rym: It's usually multiple choice But unless they've changed it the way it worked was you get like a point for every one.

202
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:35,280
Rym: you get right?

203
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,900
Rym: But you lose points if you guess wrong as opposed to putting it black.

204
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,096
Scott: So guessing won't get dressing on the whole thing won't get you a three unless you're really good at guessing.

205
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:46,919
Rym: and they also usually have Fairly extensive essay components, okay, okay?

206
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:48,604
Rym: Like the AP bio test.

207
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:55,439
Rym: actually one of the essays was like describe the procedure and the lab procedures and things you would use to clone a frog.

208
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:57,748
Rym: It was it was hardcore like that.

209
00:12:57,768 --> 00:13:01,100
Rym: Yeah, but I actually set the record at RIT.

210
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:07,253
Rym: It was broken two years ago But I had the most AP credits coming into RIT of any student ever before.

211
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:08,196
Scott: how do you know that?

212
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:09,340
Rym: because they told me that?

213
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:13,493
Rym: Straight up when I transferred him in Wow how do you know is broken?

214
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:15,360
Rym: because then al Biles came to me later?

215
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,032
Rym: He's like yeah, you broke the record.

216
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:23,524
Rym: the record was 38 Uh-huh, and I had 41, but some kid got more than me a couple years ago Uh-huh, but anyway.

217
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:24,286
Rym: Yeah think about that.

218
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:30,308
Rym: I went into RIT with 41 credits complete mmm You take AP classes.

219
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:33,100
Rym: the tests are stupidly easy as long as you read the goddamn books.

220
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:38,103
Rym: But here's the story the College Board who kind of Administers the?

221
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:39,268
Scott: isn't it the AP board?

222
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,900
Rym: well the College Board AP board same thing doesn't matter.

223
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:46,253
Rym: They have announced that they've gotten rid of the AP.

224
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,262
Rym: computer science a B Exam.

225
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:50,345
Scott: when you see you got a lot.

226
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:51,529
Scott: those letters are tricky.

227
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:57,159
Scott: those letters mean a lot cuz like in physics right this physics a physics B physics AB?

228
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:03,394
Rym: Well, there's no there's physics a a B There's also physics B, and there's physics BC, and then there's physics C.

229
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:04,700
Scott: All right that it goes up to C.

230
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:05,864
Rym: I'll break it down.

231
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:10,059
Rym: physics wise I know a lot about these because I actually got a lot of scholarships because of this.

232
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:14,677
Rym: Like I took all these classes, and I actually met with like representatives of the board and everything.

233
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,810
Rym: the way It works is pretty much a is high school level.

234
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:19,940
Rym: like if you take the physics a test.

235
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:23,360
Rym: No college is gonna accept that for crap, and it's well.

236
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,983
Scott: They'll let you.

237
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:27,580
Scott: they'll let you not have to take like basic physics.

238
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,679
Rym: Well, yeah, if high school physics is a requirement in your college program, then that will get you out of high school physics.

239
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:36,252
Rym: basically That's like the physics you take in 10th or 11th grade mm-hmm.

240
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:43,535
Rym: the B. Level would be like Introductory college class like the basic physics class you would take in college.

241
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,019
Rym: is what the B test would be.

242
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:47,618
Rym: the C test is.

243
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:57,903
Rym: The C test that I took for physics involved double integration calculating the charge distributions on Surfaces.

244
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,689
Scott: why is it's thumping around?

245
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,195
Rym: it's not hurting you in any way.

246
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:02,339
Scott: It's thumping the whole room.

247
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:05,016
Rym: Okay, I guess you don't like my thumping.

248
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:16,640
Rym: no Anyway, the C test was literally like you had to use double integrals and things and figure out Electron distribution on complex three-dimensional surfaces in order to figure out like how much?

249
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,176
Rym: Resistance upstream of some other kind of particle would be going over like.

250
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:20,920
Rym: it's crazy stuff.

251
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:22,928
Rym: It's more than most people ever bother with.

252
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,080
Scott: I got a two on that test and stuff you honey You probably won't even do in college unless you go into physics.

253
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:29,424
Rym: Yeah, like I actually.

254
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:34,140
Rym: and now when they say like an AB or a BC that even gets more complicated like with calculus.

255
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,640
Rym: The a test is like nothing.

256
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,360
Rym: I don't know if they have an a test for calculus, but the there's the B, or there's the BC.

257
00:15:40,683 --> 00:16:00,199
Rym: I don't think there's a straight-up C. If you take the B You took the B. if you take the C You took the C. but they also look at all the B level questions within the test and they give you a Subscore of what you would have gotten if you taking the B. So if you think you're smart, and you want to go for it You can take the harder test and not be dicked by that.

258
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,205
Scott: So they don't let you take the B And then the C separately.

259
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:04,169
Scott: you can take the BC.

260
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:11,840
Scott: that way if you don't do well on the C But you didn't really well on the B. Then they're like okay Well, you know you got a four on the B and a two on the C. You're okay.

261
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:13,728
Rym: Yep, pretty much all right.

262
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:18,427
Rym: and but when it came to computer science I'm gonna tell you all straight up.

263
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:22,485
Rym: the AP computer science test was Absolutely worthless.

264
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,187
Rym: it didn't?

265
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,700
Rym: it didn't involve anything that mattered at all ever and you wouldn't learn crap from it.

266
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,640
Scott: Well the problem with the AP computer science test is really these tests are designed to go along with high school classes.

267
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:42,420
Scott: Like you would take AP biology as a class in in high school and then at the end of that class You would take the test and that class was designed to prepare you for the test.

268
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,731
Rym: There is usually would take the test without taking a class.

269
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:49,080
Scott: It was usually the hardest, you know class in school I mean in our school.

270
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,660
Scott: It was pretty much you could take honors or you could take AP and AP was like above honors.

271
00:16:53,928 --> 00:17:00,390
Scott: You know it was like the hardest class you could take and the school would even tell you don't take more than one AP class at A time because it's so hard.

272
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,108
Rym: I took like Actually, yeah my junior year.

273
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:04,414
Rym: I took five at the same time.

274
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:20,282
Scott: Yeah, but Yeah, so that the computer science thing is really tricky because most schools don't have computer science class Especially not an AP level one and even worse if you look at what the AP test covered It was.

275
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:22,231
Rym: it was just useless crap.

276
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:23,474
Rym: Like it wasn't anything that mattered.

277
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:24,660
Scott: it was never seen the test.

278
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,122
Scott: So, I don't know.

279
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:25,844
Scott: I don't know about it.

280
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,460
Rym: It's useless theoretical crap and nothing practical or useful in any way.

281
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,725
Rym: I don't yeah, but

282
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:46,527
Scott: anyway, the point is is that you know having a computer science AP test without compute without worthwhile computer science classes in most of the schools Really never made a lot of sense and most of the people who would take it are people who learn Softer on their own, you know.

283
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:50,440
Scott: and then would you know go and take this test in order to like get into a like.

284
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,079
Scott: You know a better, you know college or something like that.

285
00:17:53,621 --> 00:18:02,951
Rym: The reason the main reason if you need an example of why the test was worthless if you went into RIT and IT or CS No, maybe if you got a five they wouldn't give you crap for that.

286
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,898
Scott: RIT gave you something they wouldn't.

287
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,330
Scott: for IT They put you into basically.

288
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,652
Rym: Yeah.

289
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:08,014
Rym: Yeah.

290
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,200
Rym: Yeah, they didn't give you credit.

291
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:16,111
Scott: No, but instead of taking CS 1 2 3 4 you take like special CS 1 2 3 But you could take that anywhere if you wanted to no.

292
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:17,720
Scott: No, it was sort of like this.

293
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,840
Scott: Well, you could but you had to like be you know accepted.

294
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,760
Scott: It was like the sort of like the like the head start computer science program.

295
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,767
Scott: It's like the same as your.

296
00:18:25,928 --> 00:18:26,532
Scott: it was no different.

297
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:27,680
Scott: the degree was no different.

298
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:33,889
Scott: They just sort of like you had to take like a class or two less because it's like, okay You already know basic CS.

299
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:34,734
Scott: take these instead.

300
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:35,459
Rym: Yeah, it's like an IT.

301
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:43,021
Rym: Some people needed the class on how to SSH and how to use like a Linux prompt and the people who didn't need that could Skip it.

302
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:43,483
Rym: Yep.

303
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:48,020
Rym: Yeah, but this test is going away and they're only gonna have the a-level test now.

304
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:51,292
Rym: And I'm not sure what curriculum changes they've had over the years.

305
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:55,306
Rym: but looking through slashed out comments No one was ever impressed with this thing.

306
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:59,019
Scott: Yeah, I think a lot of the problem is just there really isn't enough.

307
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:11,442
Scott: You know High school and below, you know computer science education in the country and I'm in the world actually and having it having such a high-level test is Really?

308
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:15,060
Scott: Not a lot of people are gonna take it and even fewer people are gonna do well on it.

309
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,011
Rym: The other problem is it's not like it's high-level.

310
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:25,300
Rym: Like if you study hard and learn it It'll be like a great boon to you because you'd be better off learning much more practical things before you get to school probably.

311
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:30,840
Rym: But I have a much larger rant about this that I'll save probably for a Thursday involving education.

312
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:32,469
Rym: But suffice to say this is the news.

313
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,097
Rym: and yes, I said suffice to say.

314
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:36,185
Scott: Yeah So check this out.

315
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:37,249
Scott: You probably heard this news.

316
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,461
Scott: I'm checking what this people are all talking about the windows 7.

317
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:43,108
Rym: What is windows 7?

318
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:46,100
Scott: Well, it's it's obviously the windows that's gonna come after Vista.

319
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,687
Rym: But what happened to window 6?

320
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,228
Scott: it was Vista.

321
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,956
Rym: So what was Windows 5 XP?

322
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:54,102
Rym: So what was Windows 4?

323
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:55,688
Scott: I guess me, right.

324
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:56,671
Rym: So what was Windows 3 98?

325
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:01,242
Rym: what happened to 2000?

326
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:05,420
Rym: Alright It doesn't matter I don't think anyone even really cares anymore.

327
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:17,154
Rym: But there was like the windows track but then there was the NT that was separate and then eventually they got rid of the original Windows, I think that died out on me Yeah, and then like Windows 2000 XP was kind of based on 2000.

328
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,620
Rym: Vista is kind of like the next step there.

329
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:25,217
Scott: Yeah, anyway, the thing is is it's you know It's weird because it's like Vista hasn't?

330
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:30,140
Scott: The news all seems to be portraying Vista as like everyone hates it in an epic failure.

331
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:37,332
Rym: well, a lot of people say they hate it ever in my work is like yeah Vista sucks, but I Don't see any justification to be honest.

332
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:44,939
Scott: yet in all honesty The thing with Vista is that you know, it is a little bit annoying in the way You'd have to say okay a bunch of times, you know.

333
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,560
Scott: But I mean, I guess it's easier to click Okay, then in Linux you to type in a whole password every time right plus.

334
00:20:50,680 --> 00:21:09,500
Rym: I mean, it's a lot of the problems with Vista are not actually Vista's problems But they're the fact that most people who write software even professionals still write it incorrectly Like they don't even follow the rules that Microsoft puts forth to write good software Yeah, and everything needs to be run as administrator and all these problems and they're not really Vista's fault.

335
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:16,640
Rym: It's more that Microsoft has let people get away with writing crap for so long that people are still writing crap But now Vista doesn't deal with it so well.

336
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:25,140
Scott: Yeah, I mean Vista is you know, I've used it and really it's no better than XP But it's not really worse either.

337
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:35,040
Scott: It's just sort of the same with some flash and you know, not Adobe Flash But you know like polish, you know visual polish and some extra features here and there and some such like that.

338
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,870
Scott: And you know, it's like people like oh, it's terrible.

339
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:40,280
Scott: I don't really I mean it's the same.

340
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:42,080
Scott: It's like pick whichever one you want.

341
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,200
Rym: I think part of the reason for this is that a lot of people remember the ME thing and ME was an abortion.

342
00:21:47,342 --> 00:21:48,600
Rym: That was just a disaster.

343
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:50,060
Scott: It was quite the disaster.

344
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:56,560
Rym: ME was an awful awful operating system and it nothing good came of it and everyone realized it right away.

345
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,227
Rym: It was pretty much maligned continuously.

346
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,525
Rym: I think a lot of people are free maturely ME-izing Windows Vista.

347
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:05,209
Scott: Yeah, I mean it.

348
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:06,573
Scott: I really you know.

349
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:09,160
Scott: Vista's not anything to you know, write home about.

350
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,616
Scott: It's not fantastic or great But you know, the media is really portraying it as like an epic failure when it's just sort of like a bleh.

351
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:29,280
Rym: I mean, I think part of the problem though, is that because computing is just advancing and evolving XP if you look at purely a technological Standpoint is not obsolete yet and works just fine.

352
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:38,584
Rym: It's not like before where Windows 98 didn't work and Windows 2000 was clearly better to the point that you could not Not upgrade.

353
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:42,620
Rym: you needed Windows 2000 same with between Windows 95 and Windows 98.

354
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,694
Rym: I mean 95 didn't deal well with USB let alone a million other things.

355
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:49,719
Rym: 98 was a thousand times better.

356
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,538
Rym: XP is a thousand times better.

357
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:59,520
Rym: Vista is just the same thing and the only reason you'd have to upgrade is because they're not going to support XP anymore.

358
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:12,628
Scott: Yep, but they you know, I guess because of all the you know, the bad press about Vista, you know Microsoft seems to be in sort of a rush to get out Windows 7 and I don't know what's gonna cover this.

359
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:20,680
Scott: it is it you know, because they still have all these issues the Antitrust and they're you know, really as much as the antitrust was appropriate back in the day.

360
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:23,100
Scott: I really don't think it's appropriate anymore.

361
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:36,920
Scott: I mean with Apple and Linux are very viable software wise and if Microsoft manages to stay on top With that kind of competition, I don't think it's because of any sort of monopoly that needs to be you know regulated.

362
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,110
Scott: It's because they're you know doing something.

363
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:41,320
Rym: Yeah, but everyone likes to hate Microsoft.

364
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,340
Scott: They just they still love to hate Microsoft even though really I'm starting to see more and more.

365
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:56,402
Rym: I mean, I remember I don't really remember this too much but there was a time when Microsoft was the awesome guy the underdog the guy who's doing all the awesome and IBM was the Evil.

366
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:56,983
Rym: horrible.

367
00:23:57,324 --> 00:24:00,132
Rym: fuck IBM those bastards with their bla bla bla.

368
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:06,640
Rym: and then as Microsoft became successful everyone decided Microsoft blah and yay Google and now a lot.

369
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:13,979
Rym: I'm starting to see this slow trend where a lot of people are really really sour on Google Despite the fact that Google's making the same Austin they've always made.

370
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:17,438
Scott: Yeah, and you start you're seeing lots of Apple hate going around too.

371
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:20,335
Scott: Of course It's just still the Apple fanboys haven't gone anywhere either.

372
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:25,740
Rym: Yeah Apple fanboys are unique because there aren't Google fanboys like there are Apple fanboys.

373
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:27,873
Rym: Apple did that very well.

374
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:28,194
Scott: Yeah.

375
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:29,943
Scott: Oh This is just.

376
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:32,856
Scott: you should be aware of it because it's like.

377
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:38,657
Scott: well, you know I don't think it's worth it to go and buy Vista now if there's gonna be a Windows 7 next year.

378
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,454
Rym: I'll put it this way if you buy a new computer and it comes with Vista great.

379
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,944
Rym: Don't bother downgrading XP There's no reason to.

380
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:55,620
Rym: but don't pay unless you have shit that doesn't work with Vista Which could could happen but almost everything works with Vista except anything computer associates wrote because they can't program with the dam.

381
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:57,118
Rym: But I digress.

382
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:09,440
Rym: But anyway, yeah don't pay to upgrade because Windows 7 is gonna come out and then you're probably gonna want that because it's probably Going to have a lot of the stuff that was supposed to be in Vista except they rushed it out the door.

383
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:21,380
Scott: I think really Microsoft problem as a whole is they've had this, you know this plan of you know, okay Well upgrade Windows every so many years and then there's you know, mostly security fixes not really feature updates.

384
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:27,018
Rym: Windows 2000 is still largely usable except for the fact that you can't get updates to it anymore.

385
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:32,173
Scott: for security Yeah, I mean and like XP what features have they added to XP since it started?

386
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,319
Scott: not much except for security updates and ie7.

387
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:39,880
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's still mostly as far as anyone can tell the same kernel the same basic functionality.

388
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:47,415
Scott: Yeah, I mean they you know, they might have had some performance tweaks and security tweaks But they haven't changed, you know the features for the users that much at all.

389
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:57,798
Scott: So it's like You know that you look at Linux and look at OS X and they're just sort of constantly or at least more Constantly updating the features at least for the user.

390
00:25:57,858 --> 00:26:02,740
Scott: I mean New OS X is in terms of how long it there was between XP and Vista.

391
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:11,280
Scott: There were like two or three new OS X versions that had a significant You know the apples all like check out our leopard over a bajillion new features, you know.

392
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:20,494
Scott: And while a lot of those features are just sort of nothing There are a lot of new features in the leopard versus the tiger New features in the Vista versus the XP.

393
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:26,500
Scott: Oh It's shiny Sidebar.

394
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:28,906
Scott: It's a little more secure.

395
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:32,600
Rym: I'll admit I like the sidebar, but there's no reason they couldn't have put that in XP.

396
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,872
Rym: Yeah, you could run that as an application.

397
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:35,777
Scott: Yeah, I know right?

398
00:26:35,797 --> 00:26:38,184
Scott: So it's like What are the new features?

399
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:39,046
Scott: but you know Linux.

400
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:46,270
Scott: new features every week new features every hour as people are constantly writing new software And as soon as they write it, it's open source.

401
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,520
Scott: So as soon as they write the feature you have the feature.

402
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:49,860
Scott: No waiting, you know.

403
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:57,343
Scott: It's just you get if using the Ubuntu hearty beta you're getting daily updates like constantly with all sorts of crazy shit That's going on.

404
00:26:57,764 --> 00:27:05,600
Scott: It's and there's new buttons every six months, you know, we're talking about, you know Vista took how many years five six seven years forever?

405
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:19,780
Scott: So yeah Well see maybe I think if they come out with Windows 7 next year and they do pull it off somehow Maybe it'll start like a you know, sort of an annual Windows update thing, you know And I think that would actually be a much better strategy for them.

406
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:27,382
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like we're gonna actually update the features of Windows every year Windows 7 8 9 10, you know Something like that.

407
00:27:28,386 --> 00:27:29,089
Scott: I think that would do them.

408
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:31,919
Rym: Well, yeah, I mean, it's it's just it's really tricky.

409
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:35,019
Scott: Can I think well look Linux Unix etc?

410
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,744
Scott: I've had virtual desktops right for how many years since like the 70s almost even in XP I gotta end Vista.

411
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:43,288
Rym: I got to use a power tool or something.

412
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:44,091
Rym: multiple desktop.

413
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:55,518
Scott: OS X just added virtual desktops Aka spaces in the newest version that came out less than a year ago something which Linux Unix Etc has had for at least a decade if not two, right?

414
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,586
Scott: Windows still doesn't have it.

415
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:00,140
Scott: Vista still does not have this basic feature.

416
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:03,109
Scott: It's like a mandatory feature still not in this.

417
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:05,396
Rym: how long did it take for IE to get tabs?

418
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:06,640
Scott: I know right?

419
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,901
Rym: But things of the day.

420
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:16,810
Rym: I'm gonna try something again.

421
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:22,045
Rym: I did this a while ago where I had my own personal kind of theme week with things of the day.

422
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:28,206
Rym: You might remember I had Hitler was born to be alive week, which was kind of awesome.

423
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,049
Rym: I thought yeah.

424
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:37,146
Rym: But anyway, this one is much more coherent and I actually kind of have something relevant and poignant to say at the end But I got to get through all of it.

425
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:47,969
Rym: So all of my things of the day this week will be related to something that you've probably heard many times But like most people you probably didn't actually know what it was.

426
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:51,130
Scott: There's a song or at least all the full history.

427
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:54,230
Rym: Yeah, or in the very least you didn't know the name of the song or anything.

428
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:57,247
Rym: But as soon as you hear it you go, oh that song.

429
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:57,790
Rym: I remember that.

430
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,493
Rym: I know that song.

431
00:28:58,534 --> 00:29:02,872
Scott: you did a really bad job of trying to portray what song it was Sing.

432
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:04,017
Rym: what do you want from me?

433
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,150
Rym: besides those were the days my friend?

434
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,240
Rym: We thought they'd never and that see that's totally off.

435
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,030
Rym: That's kind of how it's sung by a lot of people.

436
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:15,822
Scott: Yeah, but that's not the way you sang it.

437
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:17,650
Scott: there did not, you know did not help me.

438
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,899
Scott: But as soon as I saw the video I was like, oh that song.

439
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,330
Rym: How would you sing it a lot slower?

440
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,071
Rym: Try it.

441
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:23,674
Rym: I'm curious.

442
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,799
Scott: I don't say do it.

443
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:25,101
Scott: Do it.

444
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:25,904
Scott: That's not gonna happen.

445
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:26,969
Rym: Ah, you're a shit talker.

446
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,520
Scott: I didn't say I could do it.

447
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,305
Scott: I just said you couldn't.

448
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:29,869
Scott: yeah.

449
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:34,227
Rym: Anyways when you hear some of the other things of the day I've got.

450
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,030
Rym: you'll see what I was doing.

451
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:49,160
Rym: But anyway, so this song those were the days Once upon a time there was a time where we used to raise a glass or two.

452
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,125
Scott: Remember how we laughed away the hour.

453
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,510
Scott: think of all the great things we would do.

454
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:14,625
Rym: Those were the days my friend we thought they'd never And we'd sing and dance forever.

455
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:27,040
Rym: and a day We'd live the life we choose we'd fight and never lose For we were young and sure to have our way.

456
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:30,528
Rym: Now you're probably thinking oh, yeah that song.

457
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,180
Rym: well the history of this song is actually kind of interesting.

458
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,310
Rym: I stumbled upon a music video to it that I'm not.

459
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,855
Rym: this is what I'm saving for the end.

460
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:43,389
Rym: that the reason I'm doing this Week, but I look like oh, yeah that song.

461
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,713
Rym: Oh those people performed it.

462
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:46,278
Rym: Oh, so do these people?

463
00:30:46,298 --> 00:30:46,980
Rym: I wondered about us.

464
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,499
Rym: I did a little research and There's kind of a really interesting thread that almost comes full circle here.

465
00:30:53,021 --> 00:31:08,486
Rym: So this song those were the days was written by Gene Raskin a long time ago and While it was first played by some band called the Limelighters who also apparently played another fairly famous song first well before Anyone else was playing it.

466
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:25,740
Rym: It was performed by a woman named Mary Hopkin in 1968. now Mary Hopkin and her little single album was produced by none other than Paul McCartney and Funnily enough the b-side of this album was actually turn turn turn which was made famous by the birds.

467
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,144
Rym: It was actually a really great song

468
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:27,545
Scott: yep,

469
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:42,858
Rym: but this song which became super popular worldwide especially in Britain My first thing of the day I'm linking here is actually the the first kind of music video to this song by Mary Hopkin Which is back when music videos were a lot different from what they are now.

470
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:50,929
Rym: but the cool thing is the song was actually a Translation of a much older song.

471
00:31:51,311 --> 00:32:00,539
Rym: I'm gonna butcher this Cyrillic here, but Dorogoy Delignoyu that yeah Russian Russian Russian Delignoyu Delignoyu.

472
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:08,173
Rym: There's oh, I can't say an O and then a U without anyway But this was written by Boris Foreman.

473
00:32:08,254 --> 00:32:12,589
Rym: I can say that in the bodies Boris Foreman in the kind of...

474
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:13,973
Scott: watch out for the moose and squirrel...

475
00:32:14,174 --> 00:32:23,897
Rym: in early 1900s, but That song was actually based on a poem by Konstantin Podrevsky.

476
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:25,319
Rym: Alright, alright.

477
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:43,460
Rym: I don't know if he actually wrote the lyrics to it or if it was based on the song based on the poem directly But anyway, so this old Russian folk song or poem was turned into a very popular song in the late 60s by someone who also on their b-side happened to have turn turn turn.

478
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:57,959
Rym: So my things of the day are the original 1968 Mary Hopkin rendition and The best video I could find of the actual Russian version Mm-hmm, and I guarantee that this will get much more interesting later in the week.

479
00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:08,380
Scott: Alright, so there's this artist right in Canada I think and I think it's Canada anyway, and he took an old Buick, right?

480
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:15,573
Scott: but he took all this shit out of it like the engine and all that the stuff right and He changed it into a car.

481
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:24,188
Scott: That's you know, it's like, you know You got a Wildwood or some vacation place and they have those sort of multiple like people bicycle things But it's not like a bicycle.

482
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,979
Scott: It's like a little car, but everyone pedals.

483
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:29,960
Scott: He sort of turned this real car into a pedal car like the Flintstones.

484
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,114
Scott: So four people sit in the car two in the front two in the back.

485
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:36,727
Scott: the driver steers this brakes like little you know hand brakes.

486
00:33:36,887 --> 00:33:44,084
Scott: one brake does the left two tires and the right brake does the right two tires and it's got drums and It's a pedal car.

487
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:48,020
Scott: It's a full-size Buick frame, but it's a pedal car, right?

488
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:51,058
Scott: And it's you know, it's sort of like this great, you know work of art.

489
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:54,802
Scott: in a way it was actually in like a gallery and stuff because it's like The.

490
00:33:55,023 --> 00:34:01,080
Scott: we have the contrast of the giant monstrosity of a Buick with the you know, the pedaling, you know.

491
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,411
Scott: It's kind of like aha, right?

492
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:08,656
Scott: So These four people are hanging out with the artist or something and they they borrowed the car.

493
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:11,692
Scott: Oh They drove around Toronto with it.

494
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,648
Rym: That's kind of awesome right, you know I used to.

495
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:19,998
Scott: it can go like 15 miles an hour and It's it's you know, the brakes work and whatever.

496
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:29,574
Scott: Hey, the thing is they the car is actually was driven around Manhattan at one point I believe but they drove it around Toronto and they got pulled over.

497
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:30,900
Scott: they got pulled over and they got a ticket.

498
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,284
Rym: What was the ticket for?

499
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:36,074
Scott: I think like driving an unsafe vehicle or something bullshit.

500
00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:37,800
Scott: operating an unsafe vehicle.

501
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:41,219
Rym: I have a feeling that that vehicle is perfectly safe for all involved.

502
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,043
Scott: So they went.

503
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:45,418
Scott: they also had no license plates or anything, but okay that I can understand why they're.

504
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,424
Rym: no But it's a bite.

505
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:47,670
Scott: It's basically a bicycle.

506
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:49,079
Scott: bicycles need license plates.

507
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:59,120
Scott: ha right, so they went to court and They won but if this is the thing of the day because of all the funny things that made them win.

508
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,235
Scott: For example instead of headlights they had two little tea lights, you know, the little little candles.

509
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,217
Scott: Ooh, right?

510
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:16,099
Scott: So I Think there was an argument that was like the guy in courts that he said What would happen if a lit candle hit another car?

511
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,902
Rym: nothing They're.

512
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:22,411
Scott: also there were also such funny lines as oh, yes.

513
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:24,858
Scott: The car is so dangerous going 15 miles an hour.

514
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:26,689
Scott: Oh good lord.

515
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,799
Scott: What if it hit somebody?

516
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:30,724
Scott: You know, they're like.

517
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:32,128
Scott: this car isn't dangerous.

518
00:35:32,188 --> 00:35:39,540
Scott: all the other cars are dangerous and that's sort of like the artistic message Of it is like, you know, but yeah, you should check this out.

519
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,520
Scott: There's a video of them being pulled over and and all sorts of funny lines from court and such.

520
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,206
Scott: But I think they won.

521
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:48,695
Scott: it's it's a it's a victory for all.

522
00:35:49,076 --> 00:35:54,115
Rym: but moving on to the main bit We're getting kind of bored with doing this kind of alternating ITC s thing.

523
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:55,099
Rym: at least for the time being.

524
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:59,913
Rym: We haven't gotten any Feedback at all from you people.

525
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:00,899
Rym: if you like this or not.

526
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:03,388
Rym: So, I guess we're gonna stop it temporarily.

527
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:05,414
Rym: if you liked it say something.

528
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:10,169
Rym: if you didn't like it Say you didn't like it and we won't do it again anytime soon.

529
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:11,152
Scott: Yeah, I know.

530
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:14,060
Scott: It's like Scott's box got so much feedback.

531
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:21,616
Scott: well because your box is so Anyway, which means I think I got to keep doing it or change it maybe but this is getting no feedback.

532
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:25,107
Rym: the ITC s Alternating and we know you're all listening.

533
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:26,232
Rym: So I don't know.

534
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:26,654
Rym: I don't know.

535
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:27,457
Rym: Is this useful to you?

536
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:28,040
Rym: Do you care?

537
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,620
Scott: I have no idea.

538
00:36:29,941 --> 00:36:37,500
Rym: I was debating what to talk about tonight because a lot of the topics I have are very very specific or very very esoteric.

539
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:41,706
Scott: Mmm, you got to find the the in-between So I think I'm just gonna.

540
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:45,740
Rym: I kind of want to talk a little bit about the overview of not really IT security.

541
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:52,680
Rym: But you know how you see like on TV or in a movie like hackers movie where Penn Jillette was actually in there.

542
00:36:53,081 --> 00:37:06,317
Rym: You see like this big data center full of computers and there's like that guy Who's sitting at a console surrounded by a hundred monitors with colors and everything and he's watching the network And when the hackers come in, this is skulls

543
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:06,780
Scott: everywhere

544
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:12,390
Rym: He's the one fighting the hackers and yelling and screaming and calling people on the phone and be like Did you get those firewalls up?

545
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,020
Rym: Cuz the cookie monsters breaking through?

546
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:20,780
Scott: And meanwhile, there's like a skull coming across his monitor and that it explodes.

547
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:28,840
Rym: Ah Man, I've said this before but hackers the movie and the craft were the exact same movie.

548
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:34,340
Rym: The craft was what a Wicca wish Wicca was and hackers was what hackers wish hacking was.

549
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:37,228
Rym: Yeah, man, if hacking was like that.

550
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:40,156
Scott: Well, it's what hacker wannabes wish hacking.

551
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:41,420
Rym: I wish hacking was that way.

552
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:42,369
Scott: Well, you're a wannabe.

553
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,017
Scott: You're not a hacker.

554
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:44,654
Rym: I've had what.

555
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:45,159
Scott: have you had?

556
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,551
Rym: When I was in the kitty wannabe?

557
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:51,708
Rym: I'm talking more about the common.

558
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,612
Rym: Look at that culture.

559
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,320
Scott: Could you own anyone at Def Con?

560
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,403
Scott: No, you could not own.

561
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,992
Rym: could you get own anyone at Def Con?

562
00:37:58,294 --> 00:38:00,060
Scott: It would take me a lot longer than those guys.

563
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:10,880
Rym: I'm talking more about what if I could actually Hack the sprinkler system at my school to go off whenever I wanted to without using the simple method of lighting a fire under it?

564
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,350
Scott: That's that's the the that's actually hacking.

565
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:17,460
Rym: Yeah, I know but I wish it were like the movies.

566
00:38:17,703 --> 00:38:25,472
Rym: Anyway Of course the matrix got it right when she SSH You know, that's all we saw and everyone lost their shit about.

567
00:38:25,813 --> 00:38:26,636
Rym: she typed SSH.

568
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:27,379
Rym: It's real hacking.

569
00:38:27,459 --> 00:38:29,167
Scott: OMG not really, but what?

570
00:38:29,188 --> 00:38:38,301
Rym: yeah, but anyway, so Those things the kind of console of the guy sitting there yelling and screaming with a million monitors Don't?

571
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:41,131
Rym: they exist more than you might realize.

572
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:43,900
Rym: but I think I need to say that they're not quite like that.

573
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:53,180
Scott: They're not like the movies but there are places where there are people with lots of screens Monitoring what's going on on the internets and other networks?

574
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:09,660
Rym: So I'm gonna talk about kind of a few levels of network monitoring because the easiest one the biggest one is kind of the big iron knock the Network Operations Center like the kind of thing that the super gigantic company has and They actually do look a lot like what you saw in hackers.

575
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,546
Rym: The only real difference is that one.

576
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:15,480
Rym: usually the people paid to watch those screens are not super technical people.

577
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,815
Rym: They're basically just people hired to watch the screens and call someone else if something changes color.

578
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:20,397
Scott: Yep.

579
00:39:20,678 --> 00:39:27,960
Scott: They're also You know, so they can be pretty impressive, but they usually have less fancy graphics and more boring information.

580
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:30,108
Rym: But they look like in terms of setup.

581
00:39:30,128 --> 00:39:32,558
Rym: They're often the same like you'll have this wall of monitors.

582
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:35,855
Rym: at IBM we actually had a wall of monitors.

583
00:39:36,097 --> 00:39:42,384
Rym: there were like 20 monitors and each one had a different thing on it and all these statuses and things everywhere.

584
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:51,453
Rym: and we had these more centralized monitors and then we had in the back a full replica of like the setup in one of the remote sites and then another replica of the setup locally.

585
00:39:51,754 --> 00:39:59,920
Rym: so we could like go there to diagnose problems without having to go out to sites and all this crazy stuff, but We there were no 3d skulls.

586
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:05,560
Rym: There were green boxes that turned orange or yellow or red depending on if something was going wrong.

587
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:16,740
Rym: After possibly paging someone yep, and if if you knew about a problem you turned it dark green to say yes I'm working on it and other people could look and say oh, yeah, that's dark green Rym must be working on it.

588
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,867
Scott: I mean a lot of those operation centers.

589
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:23,020
Scott: Well, you know, they have their uses most places right for monitoring.

590
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:24,926
Scott: They basically just have all the tech.

591
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:29,560
Scott: people have blackberries or whatever and if something goes wrong the computers are.

592
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,867
Scott: You know There are other computers that watch.

593
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:36,182
Scott: so it's like their computers watching the other computers and if they see something Go wrong.

594
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:39,151
Scott: They send someone an email that says hey something went wrong.

595
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:40,897
Rym: Well, see the tricky part there.

596
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:41,238
Rym: Is that in?

597
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:51,749
Rym: As far as I have seen the vast majority of companies in the United States have effectively no network monitoring Whatsoever or very little.

598
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:59,360
Rym: I'm talking not think the vast majority That think about all the businesses and beacon that have some computers networks and an internet connection.

599
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:02,397
Rym: They have Nothing watching their.

600
00:41:02,438 --> 00:41:03,363
Scott: no They got nothing.

601
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:07,220
Rym: and think about even most like mechanics and like higher up like the car dealerships there.

602
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:11,030
Rym: It's doubtful that they have much watching their network.

603
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,734
Rym: If anything, they don't think they really need.

604
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:14,820
Scott: they pretty much care working or not working there.

605
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:17,285
Rym: Well that then does brings up.

606
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:19,933
Rym: there are two basic kinds of network monitoring.

607
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:24,910
Rym: and see I'm really gonna try to only talk about the Overview and I'm I'm not gonna talk about SNMP.

608
00:41:24,991 --> 00:41:26,437
Rym: Oh IDs or anything scary.

609
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:33,288
Rym: So Basically you can break down network monitoring into two categories proactive and reactive.

610
00:41:33,631 --> 00:41:36,849
Rym: now you might think oh Well, obviously everyone should have proactive like.

611
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:37,772
Rym: that's the right solution.

612
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:41,246
Rym: and reactive is kind of like what you do If you don't know better or you're poor.

613
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:44,800
Scott: No, no proactive is more like only for really serious business.

614
00:41:45,181 --> 00:41:47,911
Rym: Well, it's more that it's a matter of cause-benefit like.

615
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:50,179
Rym: take the example of the people watching the system.

616
00:41:51,586 --> 00:42:03,960
Rym: if you look at the money at cost to set up a Sophisticated smart system that will monitor other systems Determine what's wrong determine who to page and only page those people and apply logic.

617
00:42:04,885 --> 00:42:11,991
Rym: It's actually a lot cheaper to set up a much cheaper reactive solution and then hire someone at near minimum wage to watch it.

618
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:16,164
Rym: and then they have a book that says if this turns red call this person.

619
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:21,175
Rym: if this turns red call this person and As a result and even beyond that.

620
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:24,016
Rym: Well, maybe I should clarify a little bit.

621
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:30,058
Rym: actually explain Proactive means I have systems that are monitoring my systems polling.

622
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:30,700
Rym: They're active.

623
00:42:30,941 --> 00:42:32,266
Rym: It's kind of like the active sonar.

624
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:37,825
Rym: I ping all my servers and I have a system that looks and says well I pinged the production server.

625
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:38,507
Rym: It's still up.

626
00:42:38,908 --> 00:42:40,252
Rym: Well, I pinged the backup server.

627
00:42:40,332 --> 00:42:40,874
Rym: It's still up.

628
00:42:41,215 --> 00:42:42,880
Rym: Well, I pinged the development box.

629
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:44,568
Rym: I pinged it again.

630
00:42:44,588 --> 00:42:45,714
Rym: Ah shit.

631
00:42:45,754 --> 00:42:46,980
Rym: The development box is down.

632
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,715
Rym: Better page Rym to come fix it.

633
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,267
Rym: Oh Rym didn't respond to the page.

634
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:54,071
Rym: I'll page him again.

635
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,899
Rym: Oh, he didn't respond to the page.

636
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:59,539
Rym: still I'm paging his manager and telling him that Rym didn't respond to the page.

637
00:43:00,842 --> 00:43:03,455
Scott: We must be in the shitter possibly or I don't care.

638
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:05,584
Rym: No it depends.

639
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:21,760
Rym: it's tricky because there's a fine line with proactive monitoring between monitoring effectively and knowing when things go down and Information overload where I get paged when someone visits my website and I get paged.

640
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:34,626
Rym: someone leaves my website and I get paged when I get an email and I get paged when Bob gets an email and I get paged when an Email bounces and I get paged when a bit comes in in a page when another bit comes in Page when that bit finishes coming in.

641
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:52,051
Rym: you can go way overboard with monitoring and it'll get to the point where Even if you're monitoring everything in the world So much information is coming in that even if you have very smart people in your knock if you get a thousand traps You know in an hour How are you gonna know which ones matter and which ones don't?

642
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:54,380
Rym: and if you're getting traps that don't matter?

643
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,464
Rym: Why even send the traps?

644
00:43:56,765 --> 00:43:57,206
Rym: you're doing it.

645
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:58,249
Rym: You're not gaining anything.

646
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:00,155
Rym: that level of monitoring is not helping you.

647
00:44:00,175 --> 00:44:01,780
Rym: No, not really now.

648
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:11,839
Rym: reactive monitoring is what most people use where Basically you don't so much monitor the systems but at the highest end you wait for traps.

649
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:25,700
Rym: now I'm not gonna explain that in detail but there is a way with something called SNMP the simple network management protocol where a Computer or a device can send out a trap if something goes wrong like say I've got a router.

650
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:44,615
Rym: You know like your links this router and say I want it'll I set it up So that if it loses a connection on one of the ports the port that I know goes out to the internet It'll send a trap to my monitoring machine that says hey I lost ten internet and if the internet comes back, it'll send another trap saying hey

651
00:44:44,796 --> 00:44:45,418
Scott: I has

652
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:50,917
Rym: an internet Mm-hmm, so then I could set it up to where the system receives that trap and it goes.

653
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:52,885
Rym: All right The internet is down.

654
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:53,709
Rym: I know this.

655
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:58,313
Rym: I'm gonna wait five minutes if in those five minutes I have not received a trap saying it's back up.

656
00:44:58,394 --> 00:44:59,260
Rym: I'm gonna pay trim.

657
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:01,631
Rym: Now that's a reactive solution.

658
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,200
Rym: I'm not pulling actively.

659
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:07,400
Rym: I'm getting the divine of relying on the device to tell me something's wrong.

660
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:08,506
Scott: If this what if the?

661
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:10,578
Scott: what if the router breaks and it loses the Internet's?

662
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:18,990
Rym: yes If the if I don't get the trap because both interfaces went down or the router caught fire Unless I have a fire trap that comes in.

663
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,300
Rym: and there's actually a funny story about that.

664
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:27,600
Rym: I got a trap once at IBM from an old device that effectively said the device is on fire.

665
00:45:27,941 --> 00:45:36,280
Rym: Yeah, it did not actually mean that but that is what it said And much hilarity ensued as we tried to figure out if that was actually what was happening.

666
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:41,150
Rym: But anyway, so at its highest level that is reactive monitoring.

667
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:45,140
Rym: on its lowest level is you kind of you don't monitor at all.

668
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:49,955
Rym: But you might have kind of a system status thing that says like it's up.

669
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:50,356
Rym: It's down.

670
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,184
Rym: It doesn't page doesn't do anything It's just there.

671
00:45:52,687 --> 00:45:54,480
Rym: Maybe it's on a big screen in the knock.

672
00:45:54,902 --> 00:46:02,170
Rym: maybe you have a system where you can just SSH in and see if it's up and You don't care until a customer calls and says hey Rym.

673
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,358
Rym: I can't get to your website you go.

674
00:46:04,538 --> 00:46:06,346
Rym: Oh Let me look into that.

675
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:06,888
Rym: Yep.

676
00:46:06,928 --> 00:46:08,636
Rym: The website's down up.

677
00:46:08,756 --> 00:46:09,600
Rym: I see why it's down.

678
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,326
Rym: I'm gonna fix it and that's.

679
00:46:11,386 --> 00:46:12,831
Rym: that's the kind of monitoring GeekNights has.

680
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,440
Rym: we have purely customer based reactive monitoring.

681
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:18,560
Rym: We don't know if front row crew comm is down.

682
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:27,638
Rym: We don't care if it's and as we are the customers which we are occasionally Yes, but if it goes down pretty much within a couple minutes all of you bastards email us.

683
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:28,220
Rym: Hey, it's down.

684
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,346
Rym: Hey, it's down is coming back up.

685
00:46:29,507 --> 00:46:30,351
Rym: I can't get to the forum.

686
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:30,874
Rym: Are you guys?

687
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:31,337
Rym: Okay?

688
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:31,900
Rym: Are you dead?

689
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:38,044
Rym: so in a way you guys kind of act as our Reactive monitoring.

690
00:46:38,668 --> 00:46:40,920
Scott: that's good because I don't have an extra computer to devote to that.

691
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:46,780
Rym: Yeah, and I mean beyond that really the idea of network monitoring much like the idea of any kind of monitor.

692
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,723
Rym: You know terrorist monitoring if you're the government or intelligence monitoring The.

693
00:46:51,044 --> 00:46:55,240
Rym: the thing you really need to think about is that and the thing that IT people are paid to think about.

694
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:57,379
Rym: What information do I need?

695
00:46:58,163 --> 00:47:00,633
Rym: What business impact am I trying to avert?

696
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:17,080
Rym: I mean, yeah Rym It's great that you're monitoring the mp3 server for the office and you get a priority one critical page if the mp3 server goes Down, but it'd really be nice if you notice that the database server that our production database is on went down like five times yesterday.

697
00:47:17,684 --> 00:47:19,539
Rym: I'm glad that you didn't pay attention to that.

698
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:25,057
Rym: Yeah, so you kind of have to think about your core business and I talked about this before.

699
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:30,413
Rym: but IT Unless you are an IT company is not your business.

700
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:31,757
Rym: IT makes the business go.

701
00:47:31,778 --> 00:47:42,380
Rym: so monitoring if the switches are at 80% or 90% efficiency is not nearly as important as Monitoring if you're a production web server database is up or not.

702
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,580
Scott: Yeah It's like if your company sells apples.

703
00:47:45,102 --> 00:47:49,460
Scott: The number one thing is you want to make sure that apples are always able to be bought and sold.

704
00:47:49,821 --> 00:48:03,865
Scott: You might you know have some monitoring that tells you that you know some Apple, you know, it has Apple computers a bad way That some computer over somewhere is going slower than it could be or something else is kind of funky over to the left or to the right.

705
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:09,859
Scott: but if Apples if the buying and selling of apples is in danger that is priority number one.

706
00:48:10,982 --> 00:48:11,925
Rym: And then you can't see.

707
00:48:12,427 --> 00:48:18,369
Rym: you think about what you need for your business to continue going How much money you could lose if it's not running?

708
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,040
Rym: and then how long would you be willing to wait before someone fixes it?

709
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:27,100
Rym: And depending on the answers to all those questions You have a much better idea of all right?

710
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:32,557
Rym: Well, I need we need all of our engineers to be paged 24/7 if this goes down because we're screwed.

711
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,611
Rym: if that goes down Everything else can wait until the morning.

712
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:36,980
Rym: We don't even need to page.

713
00:48:37,201 --> 00:48:42,479
Rym: We'll just have a status page that everyone checks in the morning to see if hey, it's all pay It's not up and we can fix it whenever.

714
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:55,916
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I don't want to go in any more detail because SNMP and network monitoring solutions and all those things are incredibly complicated, but I guess suffice to say I think you get the gist of it.

715
00:48:56,158 --> 00:48:57,865
Rym: and Starting next week.

716
00:48:57,885 --> 00:49:01,000
Rym: We're gonna go back to our normal regularly scheduled Monday GeekNights.

717
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:04,430
Rym: Maybe we'll do a tech news roundup or something to start it off again.

718
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,814
Scott: No, that's not.

719
00:49:05,995 --> 00:49:06,376
Rym: we'll see.

720
00:49:06,436 --> 00:49:07,580
Rym: if anyone has a suggestion.

721
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,388
Rym: Monday calendars pretty much open.

722
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,377
Rym: the first good suggestion we get will do.

723
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:34,522
Rym: yeah I'm kind of thinking I wanted because I was reminded again because periodically people find old internet things for myself and Scott and I kind of want to do a show about The old stuff on the internet that comes back to haunt people and funny websites you put up when you were 14 that are now funny in a different way when you're 25 Plus.

724
00:49:34,602 --> 00:49:36,567
Rym: actually, I think there's a lot of interesting things about that.

725
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:39,836
Rym: because think about it where the first generations are coming up.

726
00:49:40,036 --> 00:49:44,817
Rym: imagine political elections and political issues 20 years from now.

727
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:55,899
Rym: The only way to have a candidate who didn't do something embarrassing on the internet at some point is to groom Political candidates from birth on and make sure that they never have a myspace ever.

728
00:49:56,424 --> 00:50:03,163
Rym: Yep, and in that case maybe we'll have some sort of case system where there are people who are born to be politicians and no one else can ever be one.

729
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:06,045
Rym: or maybe our Expectations of politicians will.

00:50:06,165 --> 00:50:07,850

00:50:10,077 --> 00:50:11,060
Rym: should we do it next week?

735
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,358
Scott: It's better than nothing?

736
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:13,744
Rym: Yeah, nothing.

737
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:16,114
Scott: if someone did someone doesn't go on something better.
