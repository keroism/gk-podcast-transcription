1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,446
Scott: It's Monday, November 17th.

2
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:12,087
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:12,709
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:14,394
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,600
Scott: Tonight, the X window system.

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,695
Rym: Ever have that moment right?

8
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:49,210
Rym: as you just hit enter after typing something in Linux, where before you even look at what you have just typed, before you even look at the exit code, before you even see the first return to the standard output, you realize that you have done something horribly wrong.

9
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,716
Scott: Yeah, it happens to everybody.

10
00:00:51,937 --> 00:01:09,270
Scott: You know, very few people do something as bad as RMRF slash, but similar, similar damaging things, you know, even if they're a smaller scale, like, oh, I accidentally deleted, you know, these other, this very small, not every file in the system, you know, but some files I was working on or something like that.

11
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,196
Scott: She's like, ah, fuck.

12
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:11,970
Rym: Yeah, I had one of those moments today.

13
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:22,190
Rym: It was one of those where I hit it and I knew immediately, oh, ah, and I hit control C and that, that prevented the fullness of what I had about what I had wrong.

14
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:22,911
Rym: But

15
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:42,454
Scott: usually, you know, even while control C will prevent the fullness very often, doing a slight bit of damage versus doing a universal, you know, damage makes it actually more difficult to repair because now you've got to go figure out exactly which parts were damaged or is, if everything was damaged, you just say, oh, it was everything.

16
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:43,920
Scott: And there's a, you know, a pattern to it.

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,668
Scott: You can programmatically undo it.

18
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,113
Rym: Well, it depends.

19
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:58,810
Rym: Some things can, I was actually lucky in that what I did, I was able to mostly undo pretty easily and I just have to do a couple more fixes, but, uh, so I'm, I'm in a server and I'm doing some stuff with a Wiki, a Twiki.

20
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:14,287
Rym: And you know, I copied a bunch of archives from an old Twiki, made some new webs and I was changing the permissions and I typed chown dash R, you know, recursive, uh, Apache to change it to be owned by Apache slash.

21
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,570
Rym: And I was about to type my slash cause I was about to type an absolute path through a different place.

22
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:30,850
Rym: Cause I was working from this run directory and then I hit enter just inexplicably, uh, thus changing the ownership of every file on the computer to Apache.

23
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:33,840
Scott: Yup.

24
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:34,569
Scott: That's a tricky one.

25
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:40,712
Scott: Luckily, the worst part about changing permissions accidentally like that is that you don't, there's no way to know what the original permissions were.

26
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:46,310
Scott: Well, there is in one degree or exactly which things change the permissions unless you have a backup.

27
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:48,930
Rym: Well, to know what changed, it was really easy.

28
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:57,590
Rym: I just did a fine for any file owned by Apache outside of VAR, WWW and proc.

29
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,392
Scott: Yeah.

30
00:02:58,472 --> 00:02:58,854
Scott: All right.

31
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:02,490
Scott: So now you know which files they are, but how do you know what their original permissions were?

32
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:03,835
Rym: Well, the permissions didn't change.

33
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:07,650
Rym: All that changed was the owner, the group didn't even change.

34
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,734
Rym: I just changed the owner.

35
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:12,630
Rym: So basically a slightly complicated script.

36
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,848
Scott: Still, it could, it still could, uh, you know, it's still a game of guess.

37
00:03:16,888 --> 00:03:17,250
Scott: the owner.

38
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:23,910
Scott: I mean, the owner might be root or a user, you know, sometimes it's obvious like, oh, I wonder who owns the files and slash home slash.

39
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:24,895
Rym: Here's the thing.

40
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:25,863
Rym: Control C saved me.

41
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:26,669
Rym: It didn't hit home.

42
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:33,250
Scott: But like, for example, if it hits, you know, a slash dev, like everything in slash dev is some different owner.

43
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,443
Rym: It didn't hit dev either.

44
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:34,809
Rym: Yeah.

45
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:35,972
Rym: All right.

46
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:41,510
Rym: Believe me, I was like, oh, but when I looked at what I'd actually done, it hit a lot of things, you know, like bin.

47
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:44,750
Rym: But everything in bin should be owned by root anyway.

48
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:45,658
Rym: That was pretty obvious.

49
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:47,110
Scott: Sometimes usually.

50
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:47,574
Scott: Yeah.

51
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:47,960
Rym: Yeah.

52
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,730
Rym: Pretty much always.

53
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,570
Rym: And besides, I have other systems that are built pretty much the same way.

54
00:03:52,710 --> 00:04:00,910
Rym: So a couple of things I looked, but there's only two users that could own anything anywhere with the exception of things that are owned by RPM because it's a red hat system.

55
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,078
Rym: No, right.

56
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:03,349
Rym: And I know what those things are.

57
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,213
Scott: So what a piece of shit.

58
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:07,350
Rym: I fixed almost everything you took.

59
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:16,890
Rym: But basically because of one mistype in the morning, I wasted my entire day at work undoing the damage I had done to the server as opposed to getting anything real done.

60
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:18,128
Scott: That's how those things go.

61
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:19,970
Rym: And of course, it was Monday.

62
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,769
Rym: So we have our like weekly.

63
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:25,210
Rym: All right, everyone, let's talk about all the problems we had last week thing.

64
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,347
Rym: So, you know, of course, everyone knew what I did.

65
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:28,768
Rym: So what I had done.

66
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:32,610
Rym: So we sit down at the meeting and it's the outages and alarm review.

67
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:39,450
Rym: And my boss looks up, smiles and says, so that one server got messed up this morning.

68
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,368
Rym: Ryan, would you care to explain why?

69
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:46,770
Rym: And I was like, there was a problem with permissions that I'm currently resolving.

70
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:51,609
Rym: Yeah, that was not fun to deal with.

71
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:52,676
Scott: Mm hmm.

72
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:55,849
Scott: Yeah, I'm just not so great today.

73
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:56,914
Rym: I did.

74
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:57,457
Rym: What did you?

75
00:04:57,478 --> 00:04:59,410
Rym: what did something fun happen at work?

76
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:00,627
Scott: I didn't go to work.

77
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:02,389
Rym: Oh, why didn't you go to work?

78
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,689
Scott: I didn't go to work Thursday or Friday because they went to Puerto Rico and I didn't.

79
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,562
Scott: And it was that there's like this the thing that they wanted like to be done and ready to use.

80
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:10,224
Scott: today doesn't?

81
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,930
Scott: it doesn't have to be like super done and perfect.

82
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,850
Scott: Basically, we're just trying to hack together something functional so that this one person can do it.

83
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:18,135
Scott: This one thing.

84
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:21,590
Scott: And we'll see if that one thing is worth doing and worth doing well.

85
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,570
Scott: We're just trying to make it sort of happen.

86
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,372
Scott: Right.

87
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:27,710
Scott: And I was supposed to make it happen today for, you know, for reals.

88
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,588
Scott: I got it mostly happening, but not all the way.

89
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:31,470
Scott: Well, about half happening.

90
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,329
Scott: And I was going to do it today.

91
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,460
Scott: And, you know, last night at like three

92
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,520
Scott: a.m.,

93
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:40,930
Scott: I woke up and I was like, why the hell am I up at three a.m.

94
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,030
Rym: And then wait, wait, wait a minute.

95
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,649
Rym: The story is going in the direction I don't want it to go.

96
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:49,790
Scott: Like at bat, like a minute later, I'm getting all gurgly in the stomach.

97
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,574
Rym: Oh, great.

98
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,750
Rym: Did you did you break the streak?

99
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:55,925
Scott: No, I didn't bargo, but I had.

100
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:56,810
Scott: I had problems.

101
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:01,370
Scott: So I just like when it came around time to go to work, I'm just like, oh, fuck this shit.

102
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:02,310
Scott: I'm not going anywhere.

103
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:03,742
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

104
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:04,370
Rym: It's weird.

105
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,290
Rym: I rarely take time off when I'm sick, like even if I'm feeling pretty bad, I usually go to work.

106
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:16,716
Rym: Of course, that might come from the fact that until recently, every job I ever had, I lost vacation days if I took sick days or I had a limited number of sick days.

107
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:18,650
Scott: But I also have a limited number of sick days.

108
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,276
Scott: I got to lose.

109
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,409
Scott: I'm I just lost.

110
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:21,653
Scott: I didn't want to.

111
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,910
Scott: I just lost a day that I was going to be, you know, sick around the holidays.

112
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:27,140
Scott: But now not wait.

113
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,210
Rym: So you lost a planned sick day.

114
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:30,812
Rym: Exactly.

115
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:33,610
Scott: Yeah, I only had two and a half and I got one and a half.

116
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,295
Scott: What the hell?

117
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:35,729
Scott: I have to go in for like a half day.

118
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,130
Rym: Yeah, I still have my problem.

119
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,367
Rym: I have like 16 vacation days I got to spend.

120
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:49,850
Rym: But yeah, that's the bowelular issues are pretty much the the only thing that will automatically disqualify me from going anywhere.

121
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,595
Scott: Well, that's the main thing.

122
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:52,049
Scott: It's like I got to get on a train.

123
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,610
Scott: It's like what if I have issues on the train is no good and I'm still gurgling now.

124
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,029
Scott: Let's go and gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle.

125
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,130
Rym: Yeah, this worries me because I was I was a little bowly this morning.

126
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:09,270
Rym: And maybe the fact that we all ate at the same restaurant, I have left to find out is the thing is a lot of foods we ate in common.

127
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:12,690
Scott: And actually, you know, it happens to me if I eat too much.

128
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,149
Scott: And I ate a lot yesterday.

129
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,430
Rym: So, well, I'm sure no one wants to hear about your bowels, but my bowels, meanwhile, are mostly fine.

130
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:22,950
Rym: OK, so it's Monday.

131
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:27,369
Rym: So do you have any non-intestinal news?

132
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:31,198
Scott: Did you know my intestines?

133
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,350
Scott: to stretch them out would be really long?

134
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:35,116
Rym: Yes.

135
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,148
Rym: Yes, I did.

136
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:37,995
Scott: All right.

137
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:38,650
Scott: So check this out.

138
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,376
Scott: I read this.

139
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:40,869
Scott: When did this news come out?

140
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:42,059
Scott: Saturday.

141
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,008
Scott: That's not too long ago.

142
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,930
Scott: It's pretty simple news, right?

143
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:49,088
Scott: Unhappy people watch more TV.

144
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:59,307
Scott: They did a study and they found out that people who describe themselves as very happy spend more time reading and socializing and TV.

145
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:02,077
Scott: Not so much.

146
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:03,189
Scott: All right.

147
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:12,190
Scott: There are other interesting facts, such as, you know, if you ask a TV watcher, you know, they'll be like, yeah, TV sucks.

148
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:12,733
Scott: But you know what?

149
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:15,390
Scott: What I watched last night was pretty good, you know?

150
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:27,030
Scott: So it's sort of like, you know, they even people who watch TV and like TV feel that in general TV is bad, but like the TV they just watch feels good.

151
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:44,310
Scott: So the thinking here, like, you know, the guest at conclusion is TV gives a very short term sense of good feelings, whereas, you know, socializing or reading or other activities could give a, you know, a longer term sense of good feelings.

152
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:44,691
Scott: Huh.

153
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:49,630
Rym: Well, you know, it's hard to say because I just remember I used to watch TV a lot as a kid.

154
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,552
Rym: I'd watch The Simpsons.

155
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:58,290
Rym: I'd come home from school and I'd, you know, dick around on the computer, but I might have the TV on in the background or I might just sit there like eating Cheez-Its watching something.

156
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,030
Rym: But I haven't had TV in a long time.

157
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,730
Rym: You know, we just we had cable when we were freshmen.

158
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,738
Rym: We never really watch it.

159
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:05,950
Rym: Then we just never had cable again.

160
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,069
Rym: And I haven't had TV since.

161
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:09,009
Rym: And what I want to watch stuff, I watch it online.

162
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:18,130
Rym: But I was on that business trip a couple of weeks ago and, you know, I had a TV in the room and I turned it on to watch the election stuff and I turned it on to try and watch some South Park.

163
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,910
Rym: And I discovered that broadcast television is one hundred percent unwatchable and possibly painful.

164
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,010
Rym: Yeah, there's just there's so many commercials all the time.

165
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,530
Rym: It's like every time like, all right, I'm getting into the show.

166
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,337
Rym: Oh, it's South Park.

167
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:32,489
Rym: Butters did something funny.

168
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:33,833
Rym: Commercial.

169
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:36,930
Rym: OK, butters commercial, but a commercial.

170
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:38,549
Rym: I couldn't deal with it.

171
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:47,510
Rym: Yeah, I can't like I. But the thing is, as a kid, I could and I don't know if it's just because I've been separated from for so long that now when I watch TV.

172
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,850
Rym: It's just this unwatchable, distracting monstrosity as opposed to actual entertainment.

173
00:09:53,731 --> 00:10:00,030
Scott: Yeah, actually, what it says here is that they analyzed two sets of data spanning 30 years from like thirty thousand adults.

174
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:04,950
Scott: And they found that unhappy people watch 20 percent more television than very happy people.

175
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:05,452
Scott: Right.

176
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:10,130
Scott: And that takes into account education, income, age, marital status, blah, blah, blah.

177
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,331
Scott: Right.

178
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,190
Scott: All the other happy factors that they have done study.

179
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:13,575
Rym: All right.

180
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:14,609
Rym: So what will be interesting?

181
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:17,070
Rym: Are there other things that correlate with unhappy?

182
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:21,390
Rym: Say drinking, eating food when you're not hungry.

183
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:22,032
Scott: I know.

184
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:27,450
Scott: But the thing is, I would like to say I would like to see a study that compares, you know, I mean, are they comparing?

185
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:39,749
Scott: I'd like to compare the happiness of people who watch broadcast television, people who watch television shows on DVD, people who have TiVo's to not TiVo's, people who watch television shows online.

186
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:45,370
Scott: But don't you know all the different you know, is it is it watching video for entertainment?

187
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,310
Scott: That is the cause of the unhappiness.

188
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:54,050
Scott: Is it the time restrictions of broadcast television and associated extra commercials?

189
00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:06,010
Rym: Maybe it's just the the kind of push nature of the medium in the sense that you hit a button and you are given this low level entertainment constantly, but it's filled with distractions as opposed to the active.

190
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:07,830
Rym: I want to do something.

191
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:09,589
Rym: I want to watch this specific show.

192
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:17,030
Scott: I mean, I know, you know, I have always advocated stopping watching television ever since I sort of stopped watching it like eight years ago.

193
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:22,430
Scott: But it's actually one thing that's kind of weird is that when you stop watching television.

194
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:23,152
Scott: Right.

195
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:28,970
Scott: There are still some things, very few things, but some things that, you know, you want to see.

196
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,651
Scott: Right.

197
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:39,610
Scott: And sort of like when you have television, which is something that most people, at least in this country, have it like those things don't feel like they have a lot of value.

198
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:40,212
Scott: Right.

199
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:45,750
Scott: Like watching the news doesn't, you know, video news doesn't seem to have a lot of value.

200
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:51,850
Scott: But if you don't have a television, for some reason, it's suddenly that has value to it.

201
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,490
Scott: And like if you put video news online, it's suddenly at least a little tiny bit valuable.

202
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:06,950
Scott: And it's so, you know, one thing I noticed is the biggest thing that I miss from the fact the only thing I miss from television is live sports, because sports are no good if they're not live.

203
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:07,372
Scott: Right.

204
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:11,470
Scott: It's like, why would you watch a sporting event the day after when you already know the result?

205
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,392
Scott: It's sort of bland.

206
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:17,890
Rym: There's always that guy who will tape it, but because he couldn't watch it, then he tries to not be spoiled as to what happened.

207
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,369
Rym: And then he watches it after the fact.

208
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,465
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of bland.

209
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:20,790
Scott: Right.

210
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:31,270
Scott: And actually, you know, the NHL one year put all their games on Google Video and that was pretty hot, but it wasn't live, you know, and like Major League Baseball will charge you like a fortune to watch.

211
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:37,190
Scott: And you can actually pay money to pretty much every major sports league to watch and or listen to games online.

212
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:39,390
Rym: Hey, didn't you pay that bootleg place?

213
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,030
Scott: Well, I'm going to tell you, that's something different.

214
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:43,469
Scott: I was just checking what the deal was.

215
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:55,010
Scott: Yeah, checking what the deal was to watch a bunch of it, but that you can pay a lot of money and they'll let you watch and listen online, but they don't give you your local game.

216
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,230
Scott: So it's like, what the fuck's the point?

217
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,850
Scott: I don't want to watch fucking, you know, games from across the other side of the country.

218
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,969
Scott: I want to watch the New York games.

219
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,190
Scott: No, I can't watch those.

220
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,690
Scott: You got to get, you know, because they don't want to compete with the cable or whatever.

221
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,433
Rym: Well, that's the thing.

222
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:09,330
Rym: I mean, look, even South Park, they put everything online all the time.

223
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:17,570
Rym: But like the last five or six episodes will always have a notice like, hey, we can't stream this episode until X day due to preexisting contractual obligations.

224
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,549
Rym: You know, local affiliates, advertisers, all that stuff.

225
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:25,910
Scott: Yeah, but if you use, you know, if you go, it's only the only restriction to that is like on their website.

226
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,490
Scott: If you know how to get the flash video, you can just watch it.

227
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,030
Rym: Even though the little known secret, you can watch any South Park episode, even the newest, newest ones.

228
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,830
Rym: We've been watching them on the South Park website.

229
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:41,070
Rym: Yeah, I would suspect it's at least partly intentional.

230
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:50,470
Scott: Yeah, no, but actually one thing is interesting is like NBC does Sunday Night Football and they actually you can watch it online for free.

231
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,010
Scott: And it's actually a better experience than regular TV.

232
00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:01,610
Scott: I mean, the only thing wrong with it is that they do have commercials whenever the TV has commercials, but it's the same commercials over and over again.

233
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:03,730
Scott: And this is on your computer, right?

234
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,750
Scott: You can actually switch to a different this five angles you can watch.

235
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:12,690
Scott: So during the commercials, you can actually still watch the game and just mute.

236
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:13,496
Scott: And then you won't.

237
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:15,250
Scott: It's effectively no commercials.

238
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:24,070
Scott: However, if you change the angles too much, like if you just sit there and go angle, angle, angle and change them like crazy, it'll stop you from watching and force you to watch a commercial.

239
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,510
Scott: Of some variety.

240
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,570
Scott: But it's really like not too bad.

241
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:33,590
Scott: And it sort of makes you more interested in football.

242
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:41,190
Scott: So I really think that like anyone who makes theirs, it's like whatever sport makes their stuff available online more easily.

243
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:44,450
Scott: I find myself like having more interest in that sport.

244
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,449
Scott: Like when I was able to download torrents of F1 races, I was into F1 more.

245
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,030
Scott: And then when they put hockey on Google Video, I was into that more.

246
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,929
Scott: And now, you know, football, I can watch, you know, at least one game a week.

247
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:57,689
Scott: I'm into that a little more.

248
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,689
Rym: It's like with hockey, at least imagine this.

249
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:14,130
Rym: I mean, my ideal hockey would be if I have my widescreen, you know, monitor and I'm sitting here, if I could have multiple simultaneous views, you know, have like the full rink view and then the zoomed in puck view and then the, you know, back end defense field view.

250
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,890
Rym: Because, you know, when you're watching hockey, you always tell the people who haven't seen a lot of hockey games because they're always kind of just always following the puck.

251
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:30,930
Rym: But the people who watch a lot of hockey, you see a lot of times they're looking back at the defense instead of where the puck is because they know you get a sense of where like the important thing is about to happen.

252
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,610
Rym: But TV hockey never lets you do that.

253
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:34,929
Rym: It's always going right at the puck.

254
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,033
Scott: Well, that's one thing.

255
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:41,410
Scott: that actually HDTV for all its sort of problems, you know, people not hooking it up.

256
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:43,410
Scott: It's being kind of silly for a lot of things.

257
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:43,712
Scott: Right.

258
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:45,810
Scott: For sports, HDTV is amazing.

259
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:46,593
Scott: Oh, hands down.

260
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:51,890
Scott: Not just because the image quality is better, but because you can just see that much more of what's going on.

261
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,130
Scott: You know, most sporting arenas are wide things.

262
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:01,990
Scott: You know, I mean, baseball is a little different, but, you know, football, soccer, basketball, hockey.

263
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:02,334
Scott: Right.

264
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:03,750
Scott: It's all a rectangle.

265
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:04,152
Scott: Right.

266
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:07,250
Scott: So watching it in a square, you're missing the action.

267
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:15,390
Scott: But with an HDTV widescreen picture and that the 16 by nine aspect ratio, you can see all more of what's going on.

268
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:17,690
Scott: And it's, you know, far superior.

269
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:18,213
Rym: Yeah.

270
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:20,387
Rym: But I still can't always look where I want to look.

271
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:25,809
Scott: Well, I mean, I guess you can't look at the goalie on the other end of the ice.

272
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:36,510
Rym: I mean, I guess I want one of those little monitored bug buzzers from Hyperion and I can just kind of float around the hockey rink and look wherever I want.

273
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:36,971
Rym: Yeah.

274
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:44,350
Scott: I just, you know, I'm just going to put this little news story about TV making people unhappy in my argue against TV ammo box.

275
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:49,229
Scott: And anyone out there who still watches TV, you know, the old fashioned way, what's wrong with you?

276
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:52,250
Rym: It's but it is really difficult because is it the cause or the effect?

277
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,590
Rym: Is it that people who are already unhappy are looking for low level stimulation to distract them?

278
00:16:57,091 --> 00:17:03,470
Rym: Or is it people who are otherwise happy become unhappy because they are experiencing this low level constant stimulation?

279
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:04,296
Scott: Yeah, it's.

280
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:05,789
Scott: it's a difficult one to say.

281
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:09,810
Rym: And does the constant low level stimulation of poking around FARC have the same effect?

282
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,267
Scott: That's why I stopped doing that, too.

283
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:14,589
Rym: Or is it the same effect?

284
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:16,008
Scott: Who knows?

285
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,888
Scott: The shadow knows.

286
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:18,990
Scott: Yeah.

287
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:22,280
Scott: The thing is, you know, it says here at the end of the slash.

288
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,730
Scott: that summary, at least that TV can become a kind of opiate.

289
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,090
Scott: It's habitual and tuning in can be an easy way of tuning out.

290
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,670
Scott: So whether, you know, it's because you're on say that about natural selection, you could.

291
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:44,750
Scott: But whether your TV watching is, you know, because you're unhappy or you are, you know, the TV watching is making you unhappy.

292
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:52,850
Scott: Stopping watching the TV, even if it's not the cause of your unhappiness, will force you to face your unhappiness rather than escape from it.

293
00:17:52,970 --> 00:18:00,050
Scott: And thus will put you in a situation where you are able to, you know, fight against it instead of just run away from it.

294
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,110
Scott: And if the TV is the cause of your unhappiness, then stop watching.

295
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,975
Scott: It will make you happy.

296
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:06,990
Scott: So either way, stop watching.

297
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:09,029
Scott: Less TV is going to help you out.

298
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:16,290
Rym: See, I don't want to step further and say that the key is to don't do passive things and only do active things when you're unhappy.

299
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,950
Rym: Like if you're unhappy, don't do the passive default.

300
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,149
Rym: Don't come home and turn on the TV.

301
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,030
Rym: Don't come home and read your form and go to FARC and then log on to your Laconica and read all your tweets.

302
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,510
Rym: Just always do something active.

303
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:31,710
Rym: Do something that requires you to take a conscious effort with a conscious goal.

304
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:40,350
Scott: Yeah, whatever you are doing, you should be doing it intentionally and you should think about, you know, before you do anything, think about like I'm going to do X and then do it.

305
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,930
Rym: You know, that's exactly what the fourth way says before it tells you it's going to eat your soul.

306
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,410
Scott: Yeah, it's like you'll come home and you'll just automatically watch TV without even there's no conscious thought behind it.

307
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:52,694
Scott: It's just.

308
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:53,870
Scott: it's all like an unconscious.

309
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:57,310
Scott: You just naturally sit down on the couch and push the button.

310
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,930
Rym: Kind of like when we were at RIT and whenever the public there's a couple of times where the Internet went out.

311
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,930
Rym: And I remember we'd all be sitting around, you know, I'd be the way our apartment was laid out.

312
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,930
Rym: Scott and I had our computers in the living room just like next to each other on two different desks.

313
00:19:10,431 --> 00:19:11,634
Rym: And then the couches kind of ring.

314
00:19:11,654 --> 00:19:16,830
Rym: the rest of the room and the rest of the crew would kind of sit in a ring and we'd like poke at the computer and talk.

315
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,550
Rym: And the computers would always be kind of central to what we were all doing.

316
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,890
Rym: Whenever the computers were down, whenever the Internet wasn't working, like we'd just be sitting there.

317
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,590
Rym: You know, I'd just be sitting in my chair facing away from the computer like nothing's up and someone would say something.

318
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:35,470
Rym: And naturally, I would just turn around and just start clicking on Firefox like it's going to do something.

319
00:19:35,811 --> 00:19:39,310
Scott: Yeah, because it's just you have this natural, unthinking reflex.

320
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:48,790
Scott: But if you were if you were all your actions were intentional, if you were thinking, I will search for that on the Internet, then you would realize the Internet is down and you wouldn't do that useless thing.

321
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:51,209
Rym: Even better was the time the power was out.

322
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:55,622
Rym: And I remember thinking, crap, I can't play tribes to.

323
00:19:55,702 --> 00:19:58,270
Scott: let me go find out how long this power is going to be out.

324
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,249
Scott: Let me go to the power company's website.

325
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:05,449
Rym: Even worse was later, I was like, I'm hungry, I'll order pizza.

326
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:08,209
Rym: And I went straight for the Web.

327
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,051
Scott: Yep.

328
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:10,614
Rym: And it took me.

329
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:14,821
Rym: I actually sat down in front of my desk and like reached for the.

330
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:19,610
Rym: I didn't actually touch the mouse, but I reached for the mouse before I realized that the computer wasn't even on.

331
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:21,028
Rym: The lights weren't even on.

332
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,888
Rym: There was no way this was going to work.

333
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:29,750
Rym: Anyway, anyway, there's this article here on Slashdot saying I'll just read the headline.

334
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,069
Rym: Open Office is five times more popular than Google Docs.

335
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:35,730
Scott: That's all it's been around longer.

336
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,230
Scott: It has a lot more features.

337
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,129
Scott: You know, you're getting a lot more for the same price.

338
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,690
Scott: Well, people are asking Google doesn't really advertise Google Docs, but Open Office sort of gets around.

339
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:53,690
Rym: Well, the thing is, people have been people are really getting worked up about this and there's a giant argument and slash kind of gets to get worked up about their different things.

340
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:55,370
Rym: Slashdot, they get worked up about everything.

341
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,931
Rym: All right.

342
00:20:56,272 --> 00:21:03,610
Rym: But I don't know, there are people seem to be acting as though Open Office is somehow beating Google Docs.

343
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,750
Rym: And I think I agree with you that they're basic.

344
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,270
Rym: They're two different things like beating.

345
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:10,178
Rym: Well, beating.

346
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,509
Scott: OK, doing better than.

347
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,015
Scott: Sure.

348
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:12,690
Scott: All right.

349
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:16,770
Scott: What if it is even if you're even if we're not going to make the argument that they're different things?

350
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,629
Scott: Scott, so what?

351
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,830
Rym: These are open source people.

352
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,970
Rym: I mean, this is the people who have giant campaigns to make sure Firefox or Opera gets downloaded more times than some other browser.

353
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,884
Scott: No, no, but go on.

354
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:29,691
Rym: I don't know.

355
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:34,690
Rym: Just even like analysts and industry people, they like they're always trying to figure out what's going on.

356
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,470
Rym: I mean, these the cloud and online apps are the future.

357
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:44,670
Rym: But yet clouds and online apps, while they're popular among certain segments, are not as popular among the masses.

358
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,190
Rym: And most people will like an office software.

359
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,448
Rym: Most people will use office software on their local PC rather than going online and using Google Docs.

360
00:21:53,311 --> 00:22:02,370
Rym: And I think part of that is just that local software in most cases is still better, performs better, more useful, more reliable than cloud.

361
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:14,050
Scott: See, I think really, right, the reason if you that, you know, Google has a lot of other things besides Google search, right, but Google search continues to dominate.

362
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:24,210
Scott: And even though, you know, Gmail is their second most popular thing, right, is still actually used a lot less than, say, Yahoo!

363
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,750
Scott: Mail or Hotmail or those sorts of things.

364
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:29,850
Scott: And you wonder, like, how is Google falling behind?

365
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,250
Scott: Gmail is just better.

366
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,390
Scott: And as soon as you get someone to use Gmail, they go, oh, yeah, it is just better.

367
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,589
Scott: Why was I using stupid Yahoo!

368
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,952
Scott: Mail?

369
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:37,907
Scott: And you know what I think the difference is?

370
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:38,732
Rym: No.

371
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:42,810
Scott: If you go to Google.com, right, what do you see?

372
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:49,010
Scott: You see the word Google and you see the search box and in the top left, they have little links, you know, and one of the links up there is for Gmail.

373
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:50,190
Scott: But all it says is Gmail.

374
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,891
Scott: Right.

375
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:58,790
Scott: But if you go to Yahoo.com, right, it's exploding all over the place with all this stuff like, oh, my God's mail.

376
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,730
Scott: Oh, my God's messenger.

377
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:03,429
Scott: Oh, my God's all this, you know, weather is in.

378
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:09,289
Scott: Well, I think this is very intense because Google doesn't tell people about its shit.

379
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,685
Scott: It doesn't push it.

380
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:14,050
Scott: It only pushes the brand of Google itself.

381
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:15,669
Scott: I'm saying doesn't push the apps.

382
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,850
Scott: No wonder no one uses them.

383
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:24,590
Rym: I think this is very intentional on Google's part because all these apps are kind of like a lot of the things Google has, they're more experiments than products.

384
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:30,390
Rym: And they're trying to get these things to a state that are more workable or trying to develop them or just having them there.

385
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,949
Rym: So they have a presence in that market even though they don't do anything with it right away.

386
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:45,270
Rym: But I think the reason they're very subdued when they kind of advertise or talk about a lot of these things is that they only want people using them or at least reasonably tech savvy.

387
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:55,870
Rym: You know, people who use Google Docs by and large are people who knew about it anyway, as opposed to people who are kind of told about it by Google, like, hey, come use the docs.

388
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:56,770
Rym: It's awesome.

389
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:11,450
Rym: Like Yahoo does, because that make means that while it's still this beta and while it's still not fully featured, I mean, Google Docs lacks enough functionality to where the average person who's used to Microsoft Word or open office would find it 100 percent unusable.

390
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:16,850
Scott: Yeah, I mean, even today, I was trying to do some stuff with Google Docs and it was giving me some guff.

391
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,990
Scott: So I resorted back to using open office and also numeric and happy word and those sorts of things.

392
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,450
Rym: Even worse is Google Gears.

393
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,449
Rym: I mean, basically, it just doesn't work.

394
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,032
Rym: What do you mean?

395
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:31,910
Scott: Google Gears works great for me for the thing is you can't like you can't open the door in combination with dots.

396
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,253
Rym: Yes.

397
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:34,570
Rym: No, I'm not just talking about Google Gears out of the blue.

398
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:41,010
Rym: The eight is good, but the way it is used with Google Docs is so useless that it's useless.

399
00:24:41,872 --> 00:24:43,209
Scott: Yeah, it's not really good.

400
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:47,190
Scott: I mean, Google Gears is very good for, you know, sites enabling offline.

401
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,441
Scott: For example, remember the milk.

402
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,470
Scott: use it very well.

403
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,830
Scott: You know, you can use your to do list while you got your laptop offline.

404
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,670
Scott: And then when you go back online, it'll sync whatever you did up.

405
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,534
Scott: And it's perfect.

406
00:24:56,574 --> 00:24:59,810
Scott: You know, Google Gears makes offline web apps work.

407
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:06,690
Scott: But Google Docs, because of, you know, the limitations of, you know, Google Docs is a very, very complex JavaScript program.

408
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,730
Scott: And, you know, Google Gears can only offline so much.

409
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:13,590
Scott: So if you take your Google Docs offline, it works.

410
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:20,730
Scott: But it's even more limited than Google Docs already is to the point at which it's really only good for read only and not much else.

411
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:21,613
Rym: Yeah.

412
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:26,270
Rym: And of course, Microsoft is as their foray into these online apps.

413
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,110
Rym: And, you know, we're going to see open off it.

414
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,670
Rym: We're going to see Microsoft Office online eventually for the masses.

415
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:40,730
Rym: And I guess the question will be if that is fully featured as opposed to Google Docs, which is basically minimally featured, then I could see it getting a lot of use.

416
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:42,624
Scott: Yeah, it really depends.

417
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,070
Scott: Are they going to build it on that silver light, I think, or who knows what they're going to build it on?

418
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:52,030
Rym: I'll admit I've kind of ignored it because I have I mean, I have office at work for doing that sort of stuff.

419
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:54,130
Rym: And I found more and more in my normal life.

420
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:57,090
Rym: I don't need an office suite anymore.

421
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:58,929
Rym: Like it used to it's where it used to be.

422
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,030
Rym: I needed an office suite to do stuff to work.

423
00:26:01,672 --> 00:26:04,650
Scott: I mean, think about a computer used to be a glorified word process.

424
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:05,492
Rym: But like.

425
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:09,690
Rym: I use them a lot to write papers, to do like data analysis for classes and stuff.

426
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:14,550
Rym: And I did a lot of things in office because that was the easiest way to do it at the time.

427
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:24,170
Rym: But just as we've gotten to the point where there are office apps online, I use word processing software and spreadsheet software less and less.

428
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,710
Rym: Now, if I need to store data, I whip up a quick little database.

429
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:33,230
Rym: If I need to do word processing, I just write the text that I format it later to a PDF or something.

430
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:42,790
Scott: Yeah, well, I think what it is, is that, you know, the office suite used to be like, you know, here is the tool that will do all these things, you know, and for many people.

431
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:49,870
Scott: For normal everyday people who don't know how to use like these other tools, the office suite still is, you know, the business for them.

432
00:26:49,970 --> 00:27:01,010
Scott: But for someone like me, a lot of the stuff that, you know, I would use a spreadsheet for, I will use an actual MySQL database, you know, for reals.

433
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:06,110
Scott: And I don't really do a lot, you know, all my finances I do with, you know, new cash.

434
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,130
Scott: So I don't really need a finance spreadsheet.

435
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:16,470
Scott: And I don't do a lot of, you know, businessy money tracking stuff, you know, so I don't really need the mathematical features of a spreadsheet that much.

436
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:26,330
Scott: And when I do need math, I use a calculator, you know, and when I when if I do any work, you know, typing, it's in a text editor and I don't really have to format letters.

437
00:27:26,432 --> 00:27:27,650
Scott: I mostly format email.

438
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:35,710
Scott: So most of my formatting is done either, you know, web pages, which is CSS and such or emails and which is also HTML.

439
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,210
Scott: And there's no real reason for me to do formatting of documents for paper anymore.

440
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:45,210
Scott: So word processor is no better than a text editor of any other kind.

441
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,970
Rym: I mean, even at work, all the documentation I write is, you know, in a wiki.

442
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:49,755
Scott: Yeah.

443
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:51,350
Scott: So what do I need a word processor for?

444
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,450
Scott: I type in a text box in a web browser, not in a word processor.

445
00:27:56,111 --> 00:28:06,842
Scott: And, you know, all these these things of people, the office suite was is sort of an old thing that was a way for people to do the work of.

446
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:14,390
Scott: it took the regular the real world metaphors of old on paper technology and put them in the technology and in a computer.

447
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:20,370
Scott: And now we have new metaphors that are not dependent on old ways of things.

448
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:27,290
Scott: You know, a spreadsheet was pretty much, you know, an elect basically copied the way that a ledger book.

449
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,355
Scott: Yeah, a ledger book.

450
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:31,030
Scott: And now the idea of a ledger book is, you know, gone.

451
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:37,770
Scott: Now we just do things, you know, with like a form and you fill out the form and then it does the processing in the background and then gives you a report.

452
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,930
Scott: Forms and reports have replaced the ledger book.

453
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,790
Scott: So what do you need the spreadsheet for anymore?

454
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,070
Rym: Yep.

455
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:54,850
Rym: Now, it's interesting because I feel like in the office settings, Microsoft is going to do very well with this because people still need these things just because of the way businesses work in the United States, early in the world.

456
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,290
Rym: You still need an office suite if you work in most offices.

457
00:28:58,731 --> 00:28:58,892
Rym: Yeah.

458
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:02,530
Scott: Just because, you know, the way the most people think and still do work.

459
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:06,310
Scott: But as those people go away and new people come in, eventually it'll go out.

460
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,910
Rym: But outside of the well, I don't think it'll be any time soon.

461
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,950
Rym: So I think they got a long time to go outside of the office.

462
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:20,430
Rym: I feel like I don't know if it's if they expect this or not, but they're missing the boat because the boat is no longer taking the office suite that exists and putting it online.

463
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:32,550
Rym: The boat is replacing the office suite with a bunch of individual tools online that do the specific things people in the real world outside of the business world want to do with their computers, like remember stuff and track their finances.

464
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:33,272
Scott: Yep.

465
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:37,890
Scott: It's not like, you know, that the the giving of a general tool.

466
00:29:38,091 --> 00:29:38,273
Scott: Right.

467
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:40,029
Scott: What is not going to work?

468
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,889
Scott: Because think about a spreadsheet is a very general tool.

469
00:29:43,352 --> 00:29:46,190
Scott: And a lot of times it's so general that it's actually misused.

470
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,067
Scott: People put databases in them when they shouldn't.

471
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:50,190
Scott: And it actually makes work less efficient.

472
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,730
Scott: And you get all these problems.

473
00:29:53,571 --> 00:30:03,670
Scott: But if you the real way for most people, you know, don't need these general tools and they're much better served by specific tools that do the exact task that they want to do and nothing else.

474
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,930
Scott: And thus, the specific thing they want to do is done more efficiently.

475
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:16,950
Scott: And they don't have to invest in learning this general tool and working it to get it to do the specific things they want to do because it has the power to do these other things they don't want to do.

476
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,316
Rym: So things of the day before.

477
00:30:26,597 --> 00:30:31,590
Rym: I'm going to head off the inevitable scouting, but watches are obsolete.

478
00:30:31,812 --> 00:30:32,662
Rym: Yes, I agree.

479
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:32,743
Rym: Yep.

480
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:33,855
Rym: OK.

481
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:35,110
Scott: I got watches.

482
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,896
Rym: However, I like watch it like.

483
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:47,270
Rym: I like, in fact, an RIT for the longest time for most of my life because I didn't own a cell phone, at least not a cell phone like a modern cell phone that had a clock in it.

484
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:47,955
Rym: I could look at.

485
00:30:48,702 --> 00:30:49,510
Rym: I needed a watch.

486
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:56,310
Rym: I needed some way to know what time it was when I wasn't at my computer or in my house because there really aren't clocks in public in most places.

487
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:03,430
Rym: So I never really wore a watch after middle school because I always thought they were uncomfortable and I never really liked the way they looked like.

488
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,132
Rym: I don't know.

489
00:31:04,152 --> 00:31:11,130
Rym: I've always found this the the style of wearing a watch, this just archaic and obsolete and uncomfortable thing.

490
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:17,370
Scott: So I always had I always got like Timex watches because I wanted to have like the stopwatch and other things on there and actually sort of use them.

491
00:31:17,671 --> 00:31:20,190
Scott: But I always also lost them because they were uncomfortable.

492
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:25,210
Scott: So I would take them off when I did things and then like I'd leave them places and I wouldn't put them back on.

493
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,190
Scott: And so it's like eventually just like, screw it.

494
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,509
Scott: And as soon as I got a cell phone, I stopped with the watches.

495
00:31:30,711 --> 00:31:30,871
Rym: Yep.

496
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:35,010
Rym: But in high school, you know, before I had a cell phone, what I did is I ended up switching to the pocket watch.

497
00:31:35,373 --> 00:31:36,550
Rym: That way it wasn't uncomfortable.

498
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:38,370
Rym: It was just in my pocket on a little chain.

499
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:47,410
Rym: And yet it was instead of, you know, always knowing what time it is, I had the ability to find out what time it was without being forced to always know what time it was.

500
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:53,510
Scott: But if you're going to use a pocket, you see, at least with a wristwatch right in defense of it, it's really quick.

501
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,950
Scott: You just go out and you see the time like, ah, right.

502
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,070
Scott: You don't even have to use your hands with a pocket watch.

503
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:01,670
Scott: You have to go into your pocket and take it out and open it and look at it.

504
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:01,913
Scott: Right.

505
00:32:02,015 --> 00:32:03,090
Rym: Just like with the cell phone.

506
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,230
Scott: It's like with a cell phone, you reach in your pocket, you get it.

507
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,610
Scott: So a cell phone is the same efficiency as a pocket.

508
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,272
Rym: Yes.

509
00:32:08,412 --> 00:32:12,350
Rym: I very clearly said I used a pocket watch before I owned a cell phone.

510
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:12,651
Scott: Yep.

511
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:16,910
Scott: But a wristwatch does have a tiny bit of efficiency over both of those.

512
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:20,490
Rym: If you need to know what time it is all the time constantly and can't keep.

513
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,630
Scott: I mean, I don't know, but exactly what I was about to say.

514
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:24,678
Rym: I don't need that.

515
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,989
Rym: I can tell what time it is.

516
00:32:26,332 --> 00:32:27,870
Rym: I look at my watch or my cell phone.

517
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:29,469
Rym: Oh, it's four twenty five.

518
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:35,649
Rym: And then, you know, when it's five, I kind of just know because it's been about a half hour after I look at my pocket watch.

519
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:36,352
Scott: Yeah.

520
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:40,230
Rym: But regardless, I do like cool watches.

521
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:42,510
Rym: I like looking at watch works.

522
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,393
Rym: I like the gears.

523
00:32:43,553 --> 00:32:53,502
Scott: That is something like as much as I think having owning a watch or wearing a watch is sort of a waste, especially considering how much watches cost, at least cool ones.

524
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:53,990
Scott: Right.

525
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,329
Scott: Anyone you want to have is too expensive to be worth it.

526
00:32:57,151 --> 00:33:11,915
Scott: Cool watches is still cool just for their you know, the way they work, you know, and the mechanical nature or their electronic features or the clever way they just, you know, clever ways of displaying the time other than, you know, a minute hand and a second hand or a digital readout.

527
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:12,798
Scott: You know, they're.

528
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,689
Scott: they're all very geeky and get geeky people excited, even if owning one is a waste.

529
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:18,532
Rym: Yep.

530
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:27,289
Rym: And plus, I still wear pocket watches, not when I'm, you know, in my daily life, but I wear them when I wear formal wear because there's a place to put a pocket watch if you're wearing a three piece suit.

531
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,577
Scott: No, that's just that's like.

532
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:31,053
Scott: it's no different than wearing any other, you know, piece of jewelry.

533
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:32,890
Scott: The usefulness of it doesn't come into play.

534
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:34,829
Scott: It's the, you know, the look of it.

535
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,512
Rym: It's it's.

536
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:42,210
Rym: I don't think you understand how useful it is to be able to pull out a pocket watch and say, oh, my, it's for 30.

537
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:42,813
Scott: I can do that.

538
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,150
Scott: I just bought an iPhone and go, oh, my, it's for 30.

539
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,469
Rym: It doesn't quite have the same effect.

540
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,192
Rym: Why not?

541
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:55,168
Rym: Anyway, I stumbled upon this watch and it I would argue that is the coolest wristwatch I've ever seen.

542
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:56,869
Rym: I don't know about that.

543
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:57,372
Rym: I don't know.

544
00:33:57,572 --> 00:34:01,170
Rym: It's it's got a really almost steampunky front to it.

545
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:04,510
Rym: And the colors are just exactly steampunk watches.

546
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,231
Rym: I know.

547
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:12,330
Rym: But of all the steampunk ones, this one seems like the most practical while still retaining the most steampunkness.

548
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:18,590
Rym: I mean, I've seen some awesome steampunk watches that are probably like 20 pounds and I've seen some that, yeah, they're awesome.

549
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,149
Rym: But how do you know what time it is?

550
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,170
Rym: But this one looks like it actually works.

551
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,549
Rym: And I think the pictures here are really cool.

552
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,871
Rym: But here is why I don't understand watches and why I kind of think they're dumb in the end.

553
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:35,510
Rym: I would buy this watch actually if it was a reasonable price, because I think with certain dress it would look really good.

554
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:41,550
Rym: And I could see being willing to wear a watch despite it being uncomfortable just because the style is something I like.

555
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,869
Rym: However, it is sixty four thousand dollars.

556
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:46,213
Scott: Yeah.

557
00:34:46,273 --> 00:34:48,850
Scott: You know, for that money, I could buy like three cars.

558
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:49,632
Rym: I could have.

559
00:34:49,774 --> 00:34:53,429
Rym: I could buy twelve of my current car.

560
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:54,411
Scott: You know what?

561
00:34:54,652 --> 00:35:00,134
Scott: You know how many completely other things that tell time nearly as well that I could buy?

562
00:35:00,154 --> 00:35:01,360
Rym: You know how many iPhones?

563
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,967
Rym: I could buy all of them?

564
00:35:05,612 --> 00:35:08,550
Rym: I so I don't know, maybe I should look for a book.

565
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,787
Scott: You know, the iPhone does a lot more than that watch, which just tells time.

566
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:14,130
Rym: one thing the iPhone does not do is look steampunk.

567
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:23,470
Scott: You could make you could easily pay the best steampunk modern in the world to steampunk mod your iPhone for less than a lot less than sixty four thousand dollars.

568
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,512
Rym: I feel like I should look for a bootleg site and see if I can get one of these things on the cheap.

569
00:35:28,054 --> 00:35:41,269
Scott: You know, I mean, you can just look at the design, you know, and take a metal working class, which costs less than sixty four thousand dollars, get some metal working tools, which also costs less than sixty four thousand dollars, and then make one and get a watch mechanism and you'll be good to go.

570
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,894
Scott: And you know what?

571
00:35:42,418 --> 00:35:43,890
Scott: A lot less than sixty four thousand dollars.

572
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,910
Scott: Probably a lot less than ten thousand dollars.

573
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:49,707
Rym: The reason I found out about this watch, though, apparently there's been one of those even

574
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:52,421
Scott: if you factor in the amount of time it takes you,

575
00:35:52,602 --> 00:36:03,812
Rym: there's been one of those fake kind of PR pushes where I saw a bunch of articles, different news sources talking about how to spot a bootleg Rolex or a fake, you know, all these fancy watches, how to spot the fake ones.

576
00:36:03,852 --> 00:36:06,450
Rym: Who cares how you you definitely don't want to get ripped off.

577
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,989
Rym: You really want to get the real one.

578
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:31,309
Rym: And I wonder I have a feeling that there's some sort of effort behind the scenes trying to convince people in this bad economy where they're definitely not going to be buying these luxury items like they might in the past to not buy the bootlegs and to to spend the valuable, you know, the money on the valuable real Rolex instead of the identical but twenty dollar faux legs.

579
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:41,257
Scott: Yeah, I really don't understand why would you if there's a Rolex and there's an identical watch, it's identical in every way, except the R is slightly crooked to, you know, for whatever reason or even.

580
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:42,629
Scott: maybe it's a real fake Rolex.

581
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,950
Scott: It actually says Rolex, right?

582
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:49,137
Scott: What the fuck do you care if it was actually made by the Rolex company or by some guy in Chinatown?

583
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,010
Scott: Is it tell time?

584
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:50,697
Scott: Yes.

585
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:51,389
Scott: Does it work?

586
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,032
Scott: Yes.

587
00:36:52,922 --> 00:36:53,570
Scott: It's a lot cheaper.

588
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,502
Scott: What the fuck's the difference?

589
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:54,989
Scott: Who cares?

590
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,488
Rym: Well, people who cares.

591
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,729
Rym: It's like the difference between wearing a fake diamond and a real diamond.

592
00:37:00,712 --> 00:37:03,190
Scott: Well, the the fake diamond is shinier.

593
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:04,470
Scott: It's better and cheaper.

594
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,890
Rym: Why would you wear the real one if it's fake?

595
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,967
Rym: It's actually not shinier.

596
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:13,990
Scott: Well, if it's a, you know, a real diamond, but is manufactured by humans as opposed to by the earth.

597
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,150
Rym: But then it's a real diamond.

598
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,389
Rym: I said fake diamond, as in cubic zirconia.

599
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,390
Scott: Cubic zirconia can be pretty shiny.

600
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,850
Rym: Not as shiny as a diamond.

601
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:21,477
Scott: Why not?

602
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,030
Rym: Refractive index.

603
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:24,724
Rym: It can't be.

604
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,770
Scott: Just, you know, who can tell the difference?

605
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,628
Scott: Not most people.

606
00:37:29,252 --> 00:37:31,410
Rym: You can tell that the cubic zirconia pretty easily.

607
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,209
Scott: We'll have to do some tests.

608
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,690
Scott: I'm just saying that most people can't tell an HGTV from a regular.

609
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,809
Rym: I'm just saying that there are people who could tell.

610
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,309
Rym: And if you care about that sort of thing, then you probably got to spend money, you know.

611
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,230
Scott: But why care?

612
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:43,950
Scott: That's the question.

613
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:45,729
Scott: Not if do you care, but why?

614
00:37:46,072 --> 00:37:47,049
Rym: Maybe it's a status symbol.

615
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,350
Rym: I want to you know, if I have billions of dollars, I want to show off.

616
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,929
Rym: Look, I've got the fancy watch.

617
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:56,830
Scott: This cost more than a small, you know, it shows off a lot more than a fancy watch.

618
00:37:57,252 --> 00:37:58,348
Scott: A billion dollars.

619
00:38:00,193 --> 00:38:01,770
Scott: Just show me your bank statement, dude.

620
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:06,729
Scott: You don't need to, you know, if you show me a bank statement of a billion dollars, I'll actually be impressed.

621
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:13,970
Scott: If you show me that you're someone who has a billion dollars, but you're so dumb that you spent it on a stupid watch, I'm going to be less impressed.

622
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,089
Scott: In fact, I will look down on you instead of up.

623
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:17,090
Rym: I don't know, Scott.

624
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:23,569
Rym: I find it silly that people might spend that much money on a watch, but I don't find it quite as horrible as you seem to.

625
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:24,970
Scott: It's pretty stupid.

626
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,108
Rym: It's not that bad.

627
00:38:26,692 --> 00:38:26,974
Rym: There are.

628
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:28,629
Rym: there are worse things in the world.

629
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:29,210
Scott: Yeah.

630
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,469
Scott: Someone who bought the hundred and twenty thousand dollar watch.

631
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,488
Rym: Anyway, so what do you have for me?

632
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:35,630
Scott: OK, so check this out.

633
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,830
Scott: Do you remember way back in the day there was the MP3 listening test or not?

634
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,526
Scott: Do you remember that?

635
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:47,990
Scott: No, basically what they did is they took all the different MP3 encoders.

636
00:38:48,351 --> 00:38:48,632
Scott: Right.

637
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:53,310
Scott: And they encoded one hundred and twenty eight bit kilobit per second VBR file.

638
00:38:53,613 --> 00:38:53,774
Scott: Right.

639
00:38:53,794 --> 00:38:55,410
Scott: The same file with every encoder.

640
00:38:55,651 --> 00:39:04,429
Scott: Well, and they put the audio out there for you to listen to and you go and you listen to them and you say which one you thought was best.

641
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:11,469
Scott: And, you know, they're trying to figure out, you know, which MP3 encoder is the best at the same quality settings.

642
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:14,870
Scott: And, you know, it's pretty cool.

643
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:18,290
Scott: You go and you listen to the audio and you say that one sounds the best.

644
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:22,560
Scott: And then in the end, people are going to figure out, you know, should we be encoding our MP3s with Lame?

645
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,890
Scott: Should we be encoding them with Fraunhofer?

646
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,210
Scott: Should be encoding them with iTunes?

647
00:39:26,692 --> 00:39:27,587
Scott: You know, what should we be encoding?

648
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,890
Rym: I recall studies I've seen in the past.

649
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,430
Rym: I don't know if there were that one in particular.

650
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:35,393
Rym: I remember that the differences pretty much disappeared if you just used a higher bit rate.

651
00:39:35,797 --> 00:39:37,170
Scott: Well, that's that's, of course, true.

652
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:42,189
Scott: But that's why they're only doing it for the hundred and twenty eight kilobit VBR, because, you know, the goal of it.

653
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:49,730
Scott: The point is, if you want good audio quality, right, actually good, you're not going to use an MP3 at one hundred and twenty eight kilobits.

654
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,430
Scott: And it doesn't matter what encoder you use.

655
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:56,410
Scott: It just, you know, the point of an MP3 is that you care about saving space.

656
00:39:56,571 --> 00:40:01,050
Scott: You want a smaller file, but you still want the audio to be the size.

657
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:10,290
Rym: The difference between a 320 to, you know, 60 VBR versus on 192 to 60 VBR is not that much compared to the difference between an MP3 and a wave.

658
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,750
Rym: So I'm already saving the majority of the space anyway.

659
00:40:12,991 --> 00:40:15,129
Rym: It's just it's limited returns beyond that point.

660
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:21,970
Scott: Yeah, but, you know, there are people out there who really want to save space and, you know, they care about this kind of thing and whatever.

661
00:40:22,832 --> 00:40:29,110
Scott: And so you can go here and you can take this MP3 listening test and say which one you think sounds better than the others.

662
00:40:29,451 --> 00:40:33,950
Scott: The only thing is, I'm not sure if this is like double blind or not.

663
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,977
Scott: Well, I guess it can't.

664
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,610
Scott: Well, it did just be blind, right?

665
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,729
Scott: It's like do they tell you which one you're listening to?

666
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,710
Scott: Because if they do that, that's no good.

667
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:43,369
Rym: Well, then it's not blind at all.

668
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,649
Rym: But yeah, well, I guess you haven't done it then.

669
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:48,950
Scott: OK, now let's see, I'm checking it out right now.

670
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:58,050
Rym: Actually, I'm opening up the thing because as long as they randomize, you know, the order they give them to you, then the computer itself is, I guess, blind because it can influence you.

671
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:02,652
Rym: I mean, the reason we have double blind is so that the researcher can't influence your decision.

672
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:03,174
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

673
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:10,649
Scott: OK, so consciously, it does look like it is blind and there's actually a Java application that you run and plays the things for you.

674
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:13,450
Scott: So actually, that is actually going to add answers.

675
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:31,510
Scott: My second question was, was even if they're encoded by different encoders, right, if I play one in Winamp and another guy plays one in iTunes, there's a different decoder and he's doing different post-processing to the audio and the sound card could be doing stuff and they could be and the speakers could be different.

676
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:40,810
Scott: And as all these other factors coming into play, but by having a Java program, do the decoding and the playing and the testing that actually solves a lot of those problems.

677
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:46,610
Scott: And, you know, everyone's going to get a very, very similar listening experience with only the hardware being different.

678
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:53,030
Scott: And, you know, the hardware being different is OK because you want to see which one is the best across, you know, all the different very hardware out there.

679
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:56,770
Scott: So, yeah, you know, keep an eye on this.

680
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:57,970
Scott: Take the test if you want.

681
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:09,471
Scott: And if you're somebody who encodes a lot of MP3s, then you can come back here when the test is done and figure out which encoder you should be using, you know, and it's all good.

682
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,290
Rym: So tonight we're talking about the X-Men.

683
00:42:13,152 --> 00:42:16,010
Scott: No, we're not talking about the X Window system.

684
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:23,350
Scott: A lot of people don't even like know what the X Window system is or realize, you know, how old it is or anything.

685
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:29,890
Scott: But, you know, this could end up being a boring show, but I don't give a shit because this is something that I was excited about.

686
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:32,009
Scott: And recently my excitement has been rekindled.

687
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,290
Rym: You've been up with the foul language tonight.

688
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,388
Rym: Wonder if it's related to your bowels.

689
00:42:37,652 --> 00:42:38,408
Scott: What foul language I use.

690
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,337
Scott: I said rekindled.

691
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:40,650
Rym: Is that bad language?

692
00:42:41,531 --> 00:42:42,550
Scott: Is that a bad word suddenly?

693
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:43,810
Scott: No rekindling?

694
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:44,574
Rym: I don't know.

695
00:42:44,594 --> 00:42:45,830
Rym: It's just been a lot more than usual.

696
00:42:46,051 --> 00:42:47,247
Rym: You've upped the ante a little bit.

697
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:49,519
Scott: What are you saying?

698
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:50,188
Scott: bad words like that?

699
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,450
Scott: So back in the day, right, you had Unix systems, right?

700
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,030
Scott: There was no real GUI going on.

701
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,393
Scott: And there were lots of different people coming up with different, you know, graphical systems.

702
00:43:03,453 --> 00:43:06,530
Scott: And even today on Linux and different Unixes, right?

703
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,049
Scott: There are different graphicals.

704
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,489
Scott: I mean, Linux comes with a frame buffer, right?

705
00:43:10,832 --> 00:43:12,050
Scott: A kernel frame buffer.

706
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:19,450
Scott: And when you start like a Linux system, you ever start like an Ubuntu system and you see like that Ubuntu logo show up with that progress bar, right?

707
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:22,230
Scott: That's the Linux kernel frame buffer doing that.

708
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,033
Scott: You know, when you start a Linux machine, you see the penguin up there instead of just text.

709
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,210
Scott: That's also the kernel frame buffer doing that.

710
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:31,120
Scott: That's not, you know, any sort of actual GUI.

711
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:36,750
Scott: that is like that's directly accessing the video hardware in order to draw on the screen.

712
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:37,312
Scott: All right.

713
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:45,550
Scott: But what they had it back in the day, they had these unique systems and the unique systems and Linux systems in particular.

714
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,093
Scott: All right.

715
00:43:46,395 --> 00:43:49,210
Scott: People don't realize this, that they are multi user systems.

716
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:52,170
Scott: And therefore are fundamentally different from Windows computers.

717
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:52,831
Scott: Right.

718
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:56,830
Scott: DOS and Windows are sort of the single user systems.

719
00:43:56,991 --> 00:44:00,470
Scott: It's it's designed, you know, it's a PC, a personal computer.

720
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:06,070
Scott: They're operating systems designed for one person to sit in front of one computer.

721
00:44:06,452 --> 00:44:09,330
Scott: And the computer they were sitting in front of was the actual computer.

722
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:09,792
Scott: Right.

723
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:15,230
Scott: Unix, Linux and all other such Nix's, BSDs and whatnot are multi user systems.

724
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:20,317
Scott: These were designed back in the day when you had one big computer and a bunch of people using them.

725
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:21,269
Scott: All right.

726
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:26,355
Scott: And that's why when you even when you use the Linux system today, it's still a multi user system.

727
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:28,650
Scott: Everything is being done by a different user.

728
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:35,330
Scott: You get the root user, you got yourself, you've got the Apache user that runs the web server, the MySQL user that runs the database server.

729
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:39,129
Scott: You know, someone your friend can log into the machine while you're using it.

730
00:44:39,431 --> 00:44:41,169
Scott: You know, all that stuff is going on.

731
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:51,150
Scott: Windows and other and Mac have sort of added features for that, for there to be multiple people who are users of the same computer, but they're not really multi user systems.

732
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:54,670
Scott: You know, Windows, you know, sort of has multi user features.

733
00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:00,790
Rym: I mean, try switching, use like switching from one user to another user without causing any problems in Windows 2000.

734
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:00,890
Rym: Yeah.

735
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:06,479
Scott: Try having like three different users all use the same Windows 2000 computer at the same time.

736
00:45:06,762 --> 00:45:07,469
Scott: It's not going to happen.

737
00:45:08,032 --> 00:45:12,929
Scott: But back in the day at MIT and other such places, you know, they had one big computer and a bunch of people using them.

738
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,171
Scott: Right.

739
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:14,670
Rym: Windows terminal server can do that.

740
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,624
Rym: But anyway, that's true.

741
00:45:15,644 --> 00:45:15,969
Scott: That's true.

742
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,550
Scott: But that's that's a thing on top of Windows is not part of Windows itself.

743
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:22,970
Scott: You know, it's not in the core of the operating system anyway.

744
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:27,090
Scott: See, they had that going on, but it was all terminals.

745
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:32,890
Scott: You know, they tell that into the mainframe, but they'd all have text terminals, just like we have to, you know, a command line deal.

746
00:45:33,611 --> 00:45:42,170
Scott: They wanted graphics on there, but they needed the graphics to, you know, work across multiple terminals to one actual machine.

747
00:45:42,894 --> 00:45:45,170
Scott: And many solutions came around for this.

748
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,870
Scott: But the solution that caught on was the X window system.

749
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:49,410
Scott: Right.

750
00:45:50,273 --> 00:46:01,430
Scott: And basically the X window system is a way of all it really does, all it really does at the core is draw bitmaps to the screen in Windows.

751
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,296
Scott: Right.

752
00:46:02,316 --> 00:46:04,450
Scott: So there's a root window, which is sort of like the bottom.

753
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:04,795
Scott: Right.

754
00:46:04,815 --> 00:46:05,830
Scott: So it's the background.

755
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:06,154
Scott: Right.

756
00:46:06,174 --> 00:46:07,229
Scott: It's just a big, flat thing.

757
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,870
Scott: And then it can has sub windows of that.

758
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:15,089
Scott: And the sub windows, you know, are and say, you know, are rectangles, you know, in this position or that position.

759
00:46:15,552 --> 00:46:19,874
Scott: And the rectangles, some rectangles are on top of each other and they're in different positions.

760
00:46:20,337 --> 00:46:22,550
Scott: And there's a picture drawn in each rectangle.

761
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:29,030
Scott: And it transmits these rectangles from the computer to the user.

762
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:33,430
Scott: It's a client server model like the Windows desktop is just a thing.

763
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,075
Scott: It's just there.

764
00:46:34,278 --> 00:46:35,309
Scott: Windows just draws it.

765
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:35,713
Scott: Right.

766
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:37,269
Scott: And it's there for you.

767
00:46:38,013 --> 00:46:40,450
Scott: The X window system is a client and a server.

768
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:46,230
Scott: The thing is, it's confusing to most people because it's sort of backwards when you think of a client and a server.

769
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:46,451
Scott: Right.

770
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,649
Scott: The client is what you're using and the server is somewhere else.

771
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:56,154
Scott: When you use like X windows on your Linux machine, the server is what you're messing with.

772
00:46:56,194 --> 00:46:58,509
Scott: You're directly in on the server right there.

773
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:05,550
Scott: And, you know, the clients are sort of the things you don't see going on in the background are the X clients.

774
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:07,369
Scott: You're manipulating the server right up front.

775
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:07,852
Scott: Yep.

776
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:11,646
Rym: And also just anyone who's, you know, built a Linux like.

777
00:47:11,666 --> 00:47:24,511
Rym: maybe you're not used to this sort of stuff, but you decided, like, I'm going to build a Gentoo machine, I'm going to build a Linux from scratch and the configuration of X and the way you interact with X, if you're doing it from scratch or without something to do it for you.

778
00:47:25,336 --> 00:47:27,890
Rym: I'm not going to say it's archaic because that's not really true.

779
00:47:28,031 --> 00:47:31,730
Rym: It's just very complex because it's a very complex system.

780
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:32,891
Rym: Yeah.

781
00:47:32,911 --> 00:47:33,554
Rym: And it's also.

782
00:47:34,156 --> 00:47:38,592
Rym: it's one of those old Linux things, you know, the GNU Linux people.

783
00:47:38,652 --> 00:47:40,239
Rym: There's a lot of like.

784
00:47:40,681 --> 00:47:43,950
Rym: X is one of those software things that is developed based on principles.

785
00:47:44,191 --> 00:47:47,669
Rym: And there are a lot of guiding statements that cause it to be the way it is.

786
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:48,112
Rym: Yeah.

787
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:49,970
Rym: I didn't remember them all offhand.

788
00:47:50,372 --> 00:47:53,870
Rym: I remember learning about them at RIT, so I pulled up the Wikipedia list.

789
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,454
Scott: The main thing is that they don't want to do anything in X. that should be done somewhere else.

790
00:47:57,595 --> 00:48:01,930
Scott: Yes, but they don't want to do anything in X. that isn't going to be used by a lot of applications.

791
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:08,050
Rym: I do want to read the guiding principles of X because these will kind of they don't really stick to them so much anymore.

792
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:14,893
Rym: Yeah, but they did change one of them to break from the 1987 protocol somewhat recently.

793
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:20,070
Scott: But anyway, they'll just go over the history of X really quickly as it started as X one.

794
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,710
Rym: And, you know, they kept and then there was X two in the X two X three X four.

795
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:23,891
Scott: Right.

796
00:48:23,911 --> 00:48:27,333
Scott: They were developing this thing and they kept adding features and getting new versions of it.

797
00:48:27,836 --> 00:48:36,453
Scott: But eventually what happened is there were, you know, Unix ran on a lot of different CPUs around on Spark CPUs, you know, DEC CPUs, all sorts of different computers.

798
00:48:37,035 --> 00:48:44,790
Scott: But as the the three eighty six became, you know, the X eighty six series, the Intel processors became more popular and more standard.

799
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:52,829
Scott: And, you know, the winners X free eighty six became the version of X that sort of became the winner and the default and everything like that.

800
00:48:52,970 --> 00:49:03,730
Scott: But X forty six, while it was open source and had a sort of mostly open source license, it was, you know, really worked on by a very inner insular group of people.

801
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:09,589
Scott: It wasn't, you know, sort of open for everyone to fiddle with that much as much as, you know, somewhat like the Linux kernel is.

802
00:49:10,192 --> 00:49:12,510
Scott: And it was moving very slowly.

803
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:15,790
Scott: They were very reluctantly, you know, they were reluctant to advance it.

804
00:49:15,891 --> 00:49:17,630
Scott: It just was moving very slowly.

805
00:49:17,912 --> 00:49:20,010
Scott: They weren't adding new fancy features to it.

806
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,349
Scott: They weren't keeping up with the times.

807
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:22,675
Scott: All right.

808
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:34,490
Scott: And as Linux, you know, towards the year 2000 and such started getting really popular, the number of people using X free eighty six sort of launched into the stratosphere was like, holy shit, all these people are installing Linux.

809
00:49:34,731 --> 00:49:38,250
Scott: There's a million X free eighty six users out there that didn't exist before.

810
00:49:38,971 --> 00:49:43,256
Scott: And, you know, their desktop users and they're looking for these features and they're just not getting them.

811
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:46,987
Scott: And they have modern video cards and it's just not X free eighty six isn't cutting it.

812
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:54,890
Scott: And so they were slowly but surely adding these things to X free eighty six to sort of keep it up barely with the rest of the world.

813
00:49:55,531 --> 00:49:59,150
Scott: But eventually what happened is someone decided to change the license.

814
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,369
Scott: The X free eighty six people were all sort of ornery.

815
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,230
Scott: They decided to change some stuff up.

816
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,730
Scott: So they said so everyone else was like, you know what, that's the end of this shit.

817
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:08,789
Scott: And they said, fuck you, X free eighty six.

818
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,462
Scott: And they took the last version of X free eighty six.

819
00:50:11,482 --> 00:50:13,290
Scott: that wasn't encumbered with bullshit.

820
00:50:13,997 --> 00:50:15,149
Scott: and they made Xorg.

821
00:50:15,753 --> 00:50:18,850
Scott: And if you install Linux today, Xorg is a modern Linux.

822
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,501
Scott: You're getting Xorg and Xorg is basically.

823
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,310
Scott: they said, all right, we're getting this.

824
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:29,270
Scott: We're making this modern now with the transparency and, you know, everything modern video cards support.

825
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:38,230
Rym: I got to say, when the switch had like this was one of those things where even someone like me, because I use Linux, but I wasn't, I guess, as into Linux as other people were.

826
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,790
Rym: I didn't mess with it as much.

827
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,630
Rym: I kind of just had my Ubuntu and it just worked.

828
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:44,429
Rym: I had my Gentoo and it didn't work, but I couldn't fix it.

829
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,690
Rym: So I just used it anyway.

830
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,472
Rym: But even I noticed, yeah, when that stuff just started working, that never worked before.

831
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:50,572
Scott: Yeah.

832
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:56,390
Scott: When they actually got that switch to Xorg, which happened amazingly quickly, you know, mostly because it was backwards.

833
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:57,769
Scott: You know, it was X free eighty six.

834
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:58,724
Scott: They just sort of forked it.

835
00:50:58,988 --> 00:50:59,070
Rym: Yeah.

836
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,050
Rym: I mean, remember, I didn't even know this was going on.

837
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:05,430
Rym: And one day I had a problem with my Gentoo box and Scott was like, blah, blah, blah Xorg.

838
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,669
Rym: And I was like, I got X free eighty six.

839
00:51:08,512 --> 00:51:09,318
Rym: Is that bad?

840
00:51:09,338 --> 00:51:10,285
Rym: Now it is.

841
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:11,813
Rym: Yeah.

842
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:14,090
Rym: So I basically rebuilt my machine and then it was awesome.

843
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:21,310
Scott: Yeah, because basically they had all these things just weren't being done, partially because the guiding principles and partially because of the people in charge.

844
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:25,690
Scott: And now we have Xorg and now things are more amazing than ever.

845
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:37,250
Scott: The thing is, while the things basically all the more amazing than ever things in Xorg are things that Windows sort of has had, you know, and Mac OS X have had.

846
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:37,811
Scott: Right.

847
00:51:38,533 --> 00:51:55,010
Scott: The things that make X better than Windows and OS X are things that X has had since the 80s because it's a multi user system, a client server, you know, GUI model as opposed to, you know, the one user sitting at the PC model.

848
00:51:55,691 --> 00:52:00,790
Scott: There are all these networking features in X like X forwarding.

849
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:03,510
Rym: I mean, you couldn't do that on a Windows machine.

850
00:52:03,731 --> 00:52:03,912
Scott: Yeah.

851
00:52:03,952 --> 00:52:10,050
Scott: When you want to say use if I'm on a Windows machine and I want to use an application on another Windows machine, what do I got to do?

852
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,889
Scott: I need an application server like Citrix.

853
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:13,159
Scott: I might need I could.

854
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,510
Rym: nowadays you can use our desktop.

855
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:15,870
Scott: You can use remote desktop.

856
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,128
Scott: You can use VNC, something like that.

857
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:19,800
Scott: Right.

858
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,270
Scott: In with X, right.

859
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:28,744
Scott: Every X server is an X server and every application is, you know, technically networked.

860
00:52:28,927 --> 00:52:29,110
Scott: Right.

861
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:34,250
Scott: So when you're sitting at your, you know, Linux computer and you open Firefox.

862
00:52:34,772 --> 00:52:34,993
Scott: Right.

863
00:52:35,395 --> 00:52:39,170
Scott: The X server is transmitting the Firefox GUI.

864
00:52:39,753 --> 00:52:40,014
Scott: Right.

865
00:52:40,356 --> 00:52:42,809
Scott: You know, to the X client, you can see it.

866
00:52:43,051 --> 00:52:43,272
Scott: Right.

867
00:52:43,915 --> 00:52:46,950
Scott: There's no reason what you can go use another computer.

868
00:52:47,313 --> 00:52:47,535
Scott: Right.

869
00:52:47,656 --> 00:52:49,290
Scott: I can go to any other computer in the world.

870
00:52:49,772 --> 00:53:01,808
Scott: And if I can connect it with networking right over the Internet to your computer and I'm allowed to access your computer, I can run Firefox on your computer, that other computer over there.

871
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:06,050
Scott: But I'll see it and interact with it on my computer now over here.

872
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:08,869
Rym: It's even like it's so much better than that.

873
00:53:09,191 --> 00:53:11,286
Scott: And they've had that feature since the 80s.

874
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:15,772
Rym: I mean, it's not like you get a window of a desktop and then inside of that is your stuff.

875
00:53:15,812 --> 00:53:19,068
Rym: I mean, like the way I do my work typically is there's an X server.

876
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:21,961
Rym: we have that I SSH into that from.

877
00:53:21,982 --> 00:53:24,493
Rym: I use X one thirty two just because I have a Windows desktop.

878
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:28,410
Scott: So he is now connected over the network securely to the other computer.

879
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:30,450
Rym: And I have an FVM desktop.

880
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:37,690
Rym: And in that I just I have a million million like virtual desktops and each one of those virtual desktops corresponds to a server.

881
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:43,358
Rym: And if I go to a desktop and I open terminals to that server there mostly and the backgrounds are all different.

882
00:53:43,398 --> 00:53:46,009
Rym: This is just to make sure I'm logged into the right server when I do stuff.

883
00:53:46,453 --> 00:53:47,669
Rym: And there's a lot of reasons for it.

884
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,350
Rym: But say I want to run I mean, it's all command line.

885
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,118
Rym: These are all servers.

886
00:53:51,341 --> 00:53:52,070
Rym: We don't have gooeys.

887
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,589
Rym: There's no desktop running anywhere.

888
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:58,084
Rym: There's no place where someone will like go to the server.

889
00:53:58,365 --> 00:54:00,035
Rym: and oh, here's my Red Hat desktop.

890
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,650
Rym: It's just a command line.

891
00:54:02,192 --> 00:54:17,755
Rym: But if I need an X application, like a VeriFix or something, I just type the thing, the command to start the program on the computer I SSH into and the window or windows that that program would respond just appear in my FVM as though I had run them locally.

892
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,370
Rym: They work as though they're local.

893
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:25,050
Rym: There's absolutely no indication, no no anything to tie me to that original machine.

894
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:32,309
Scott: Except for the fact that when you go to file save, it has the file systems from the other machine because the application is running on the other machine.

895
00:54:32,691 --> 00:54:40,870
Rym: Well, and if I am showing up and interacting with the user on your machine, if I don't set up my persistent sessions, then if I close my terminal, I lose everything.

896
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:42,075
Scott: That's also true.

897
00:54:42,095 --> 00:54:45,753
Rym: That's just if you know that those are things that you just have to do properly.

898
00:54:46,175 --> 00:55:03,230
Scott: The other thing about X is that all X does, like I said, is draw these rectangles and make you know, allow you to have windows X, but close buttons, pull down menus, you know, back wallpapers, anything like that does not exist.

899
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:05,850
Scott: And it's not part of X. That's separate, right?

900
00:55:06,491 --> 00:55:10,410
Scott: X, when they deliver it, comes with one window manager, TWM.

901
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:15,653
Scott: TWM is basically what you use when nothing else is working just so you can sort of fix your computer.

902
00:55:15,673 --> 00:55:16,115
Scott: Right.

903
00:55:16,497 --> 00:55:19,973
Scott: And I used to have to fall back to TWM all the time when X had a lot of problems.

904
00:55:20,515 --> 00:55:24,232
Scott: I haven't fallen back to TWM in years because there have been no problems.

905
00:55:24,793 --> 00:55:32,309
Scott: But TWM is, I forget, is a tiny window manager, I think, you know, I don't actually know, is something like that.

906
00:55:33,295 --> 00:55:35,390
Scott: And X is separate from window management.

907
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:47,170
Scott: When you think of a GUI, you think of like, oh, look, you know, you think of the window manager, you know, the title bar, you know, the the red, yellow and green buttons on all the OS X windows resizing windows.

908
00:55:47,773 --> 00:55:50,170
Scott: You think that that is like part of the GUI there.

909
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,877
Scott: They're together in X. That's not so.

910
00:55:52,957 --> 00:55:54,650
Scott: The window manager is a separate thing.

911
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:59,952
Scott: And that's why when you use different, you know, Unix and Linux machines, tiling window manager.

912
00:56:00,192 --> 00:56:00,393
Scott: Yeah.

913
00:56:00,654 --> 00:56:11,474
Scott: Some of them timeless window, man, you know, some of them have KDE, some of them have known some of them XFCE, some of the FVWM, some of them have, you know, enlightenment.

914
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:14,232
Scott: And they all look completely different, like they're completely different machines.

915
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:20,930
Scott: Some of them, people make them look like windows, some people make them look like OS X. People have, you know, they don't even have closed buttons.

916
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:23,110
Scott: They only have like keyboard shortcuts to close windows.

917
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:30,890
Rym: I mean, like at IBM, I made these Linux image desktops that would be used on the factory floor, you know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them all over the place.

918
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:33,630
Rym: And we wanted them to be for very non-technical users.

919
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:40,189
Rym: So I used IceWM because by default it can make things look a lot like like Windows three one, which is what they were used to.

920
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:47,950
Rym: And I basically recreated the Windows three one like windowing environment in IceWM.

921
00:56:48,736 --> 00:56:49,408
Rym: And that's all independent.

922
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:58,328
Rym: I didn't have to do anything with X other than to say, yes, when the computer boots start IceWM and IceWM had all the configuration for that stuff and X was just X.

923
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,194
Scott: Yeah.

924
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:03,750
Scott: The thing about X is that anything can sort of change anything.

925
00:57:03,871 --> 00:57:03,991
Scott: Right.

926
00:57:04,011 --> 00:57:16,573
Scott: And I remember watching this demonstration once in RIT, a teacher demonstrated to us, you know, the insecurity, the fundamental insecurity of X. And basically he opened up, you know, a window and it was like a text editor with some pull down menus.

927
00:57:16,654 --> 00:57:16,834
Scott: Right.

928
00:57:17,457 --> 00:57:27,790
Scott: And he opens up a terminal and he types in some X commands, you know, and basically he told X right to because every window in X is an ID.

929
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:28,272
Scott: Right.

930
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:31,469
Scott: So he said, hey, X, yeah, that window ID do this.

931
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:32,212
Scott: Right.

932
00:57:32,794 --> 00:57:41,556
Scott: And he went back to the text editor window, which was an X window, and he went to the pull down menu and suddenly there were new items in the pull down menu that weren't there before.

933
00:57:41,999 --> 00:57:43,710
Scott: They're not part of that application.

934
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:47,830
Scott: He just, you know, told the X server to do this thing to this window.

935
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:58,810
Scott: And that's what sort of crazy about it is that all these windows can sort of communicate with each other and all your applications can modify, you know, what's going on.

936
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:01,730
Scott: And this is a security layer to make sure that funny stuff doesn't happen.

937
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:05,350
Scott: And, you know, by default, it's it's, you know, configured properly.

938
00:58:05,451 --> 00:58:05,612
Scott: Yeah.

939
00:58:05,672 --> 00:58:12,910
Rym: But a lot of times if you're trying to do if you're trying to do something clever and you don't know a lot about how X is set up, you'll run into that security layer.

940
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:21,509
Rym: You'll try to like spawn a window in X that is owned by another user on someone else's desktop and it'll fail and you won't know why.

941
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:22,151
Scott: Yep.

942
00:58:22,612 --> 00:58:42,070
Scott: But that, you know, that security layer is only there because if it's it's cut, you need that kind of thing to cover up this immensely powerful tool, you know, and that immensely powerful tool is why X is so amazing of all the clever things that you can do with X. You know, they had to make X security.

943
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:47,032
Scott: Otherwise, you'd have people coming in and modifying all your windows and it would be haywire.

944
00:58:47,594 --> 00:58:51,110
Scott: But an example of really cool things that you can do because of this.

945
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:52,214
Scott: Right.

946
00:58:52,334 --> 00:58:56,090
Scott: Someone on another computer is, you know, running Firefox.

947
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:56,553
Scott: Right.

948
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,770
Scott: And their Firefox has a problem.

949
00:58:59,572 --> 00:58:59,974
Scott: All right.

950
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,650
Scott: So you can you know, they're they're working on display zero.

951
00:59:03,091 --> 00:59:09,809
Scott: You connect to their computer, you connect to display zero and you make the window that they're working in appear on your screen.

952
00:59:10,711 --> 00:59:16,690
Scott: And now you can, you know, change, you can help you work with them and you don't even need VNC or anything weird like that.

953
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:18,828
Scott: It's part of the window manager.

954
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:24,938
Scott: Yeah, I got my stomach's getting a little bally.

955
00:59:25,499 --> 00:59:26,160
Scott: another example.

956
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,560
Scott: This is what got me excited about X again.

957
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,279
Scott: It reminded me how awesome it is, right, is I recently was using it.

958
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:37,779
Scott: I knew about this tool for a long time called X to X. I just didn't use it for the longest time until recently.

959
00:59:38,362 --> 00:59:43,040
Scott: And what X to X does is you say you connect to X servers or X displays.

960
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:43,583
Scott: Right.

961
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:46,583
Scott: And you say, OK, X. Yeah.

962
00:59:46,905 --> 00:59:48,959
Scott: You see that other X display over there?

963
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:49,404
Scott: Right.

964
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:50,136
Scott: Because, yeah.

965
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,146
Scott: Connect to that.

966
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:52,740
Scott: And it's on the right side.

967
00:59:53,562 --> 00:59:57,100
Scott: And you say, OK, so now what happens is I'm using my computer.

968
00:59:57,281 --> 00:59:57,502
Scott: Right.

969
00:59:57,603 --> 01:00:02,840
Scott: And all my mouse inputs and my keyboard inputs are being sent to the X display zero on my computer.

970
01:00:03,521 --> 01:00:07,900
Scott: But X to X is connected to X display zero on my laptop.

971
01:00:09,001 --> 01:00:20,919
Scott: And I move my mouse off the right side of my screen and suddenly I'm now my mouse, which is connected to my computer, a desktop computer, is moving the arrow on the laptop.

972
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:33,899
Scott: The X is taking the inputs of the mouse that are coming to it, sending those inputs instead of to itself, to its own X display, is sending it to the X display on another X server.

973
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:37,460
Scott: So a mouse on one computer is moving the arrow on another computer.

974
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:40,518
Scott: And you don't need any sort of special application to do that.

975
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,340
Scott: You don't need any sort of special feature.

976
01:00:42,941 --> 01:00:43,870
Scott: It's built in.

977
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:44,840
Scott: That's how it works.

978
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:48,600
Scott: It is a networked windowing system, a networked GUI.

979
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:58,120
Scott: And so everything that you do between client inputs and displaying can be sent over the network this way or in reverse in the other way.

980
01:00:58,582 --> 01:01:00,880
Scott: And anything can modify any other thing.

981
01:01:01,242 --> 01:01:04,399
Scott: And as long as you're doing it securely and you have permission to do so.

982
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:22,514
Scott: So all these things that people want to do all the time, which are just not possible in Windows or need a special application to make them happen or things that were recently added to something like OS X, like virtual desktops, virtual desktops have been in X since like the early 90s.

983
01:01:23,701 --> 01:01:26,339
Scott: It's like people like, oh, my God, leopard spaces.

984
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,179
Rym: Meanwhile, Windows still doesn't have a useful virtual desktop.

985
01:01:30,643 --> 01:01:30,844
Scott: Yeah.

986
01:01:30,865 --> 01:01:32,640
Scott: I mean, there's some add ons that do it shittily.

987
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:33,126
Scott: Right.

988
01:01:33,146 --> 01:01:33,979
Scott: But nothing does it well.

989
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:34,462
Rym: Yeah.

990
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:36,140
Rym: Like the power tool is great, but it work.

991
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,740
Rym: I tend to have like 20 windows open at the same time and it's no good.

992
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:39,623
Rym: It's fine.

993
01:01:39,804 --> 01:01:43,540
Rym: But when I switch desktops, it redraws all the like.

994
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:43,901
Scott: Yeah.

995
01:01:43,921 --> 01:01:45,920
Scott: All it does is minimize and unminimized.

996
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:46,183
Scott: Right.

997
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:47,499
Scott: And then adjust the taskbar.

998
01:01:47,682 --> 01:01:48,457
Scott: Isn't that how it works?

999
01:01:48,478 --> 01:01:48,600
Rym: Yeah.

1000
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,100
Rym: It hides all the things in the taskbar so they don't show.

1001
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,005
Rym: They don't all show up.

1002
01:01:52,447 --> 01:01:57,980
Rym: But it's still like you see it repainting everything on the taskbar and it takes like a second to switch between desktops.

1003
01:01:58,301 --> 01:01:59,073
Scott: Oh, it's terrible.

1004
01:01:59,256 --> 01:01:59,560
Rym: It's terrible.

1005
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,033
Rym: Even better, I have two applications that are old and they just show up at every desktop, no matter what.

1006
01:02:04,296 --> 01:02:04,398
Rym: Yeah.

1007
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,420
Scott: So I know everyone who has, you know, set up Linux or is using it.

1008
01:02:08,782 --> 01:02:13,478
Scott: You if you have a GUI, you're probably using X. I mean, there are alternatives to X, but no one's really using them.

1009
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:23,220
Scott: And if you're using X, there's all these features that, you know, you're either taking advantage of without realizing it or not taking advantage of.

1010
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:31,842
Scott: And maybe you don't even realize using X, you just thinking I'm using Ubuntu and you don't realize you're actually using a Linux kernel with X on top of that and no one top of that.

1011
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:35,160
Scott: And then a bunch of modifications to all those things along the way.

1012
01:02:35,861 --> 01:02:44,943
Scott: And maybe you'll have to you'll run into X if like your video card doesn't work and you'll have to edit the Xorg dot com to change the X configuration to make your video card work.

1013
01:02:45,244 --> 01:02:49,442
Scott: But that might be all the interaction you ever have with the X window system.

1014
01:02:49,984 --> 01:02:57,292
Scott: And if it is, I highly encourage you to go open up a terminal, just type X and push tab and you see all these X related commands.

1015
01:02:57,593 --> 01:03:04,204
Scott: or open up the Xorg dot com and look at some of the settings you can change in there and look at some of the things that are going on.

1016
01:03:04,224 --> 01:03:26,202
Scott: And you might notice that there are things which will greatly benefit you and greatly enhance your computer using experience that you don't even realize you're not using that are just sort of built in and have been there since the mid 80s and are things that other windowing systems on other computer operating systems just can't do and never will do.

1017
01:03:26,262 --> 01:03:30,961
Scott: Most likely that you can just do like nothing and people don't even realize it.

1018
01:03:31,101 --> 01:03:31,704
Rym: Now I do.

1019
01:03:31,784 --> 01:03:33,271
Rym: Before we go, we should wrap this up.

1020
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:44,112
Rym: I want to read the original guiding principles of X because for anyone who does know the difficulties and issues that do exist with X, these pretty much sum up why all of those are the case.

1021
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:50,435
Rym: One do not add new functionality unless an implement or cannot complete a real application without it.

1022
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:56,579
Rym: It is as important to decide what a system is not able, not as to decide what it is.

1023
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,403
Rym: That was kind of awkward.

1024
01:03:57,765 --> 01:03:59,211
Rym: Do not serve all the world's needs.

1025
01:03:59,854 --> 01:04:01,060
Rym: Rather make the system extensible.

1026
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,202
Rym: All right.

1027
01:04:02,704 --> 01:04:06,800
Rym: The only thing worse than generalizing from one example is generalizing from no examples.

1028
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:12,640
Rym: If a problem is not completely understood, it is probably best to not provide a solution.

1029
01:04:13,902 --> 01:04:19,420
Rym: If you can get 90% of the desired functionality for 10% of the effort, use the simpler solution.

1030
01:04:20,702 --> 01:04:21,606
Rym: Isolate complexity.

1031
01:04:21,807 --> 01:04:22,088
Rym: Yes.

1032
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:24,520
Rym: Provide mechanism rather than policy.

1033
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:27,244
Scott: Yep.

1034
01:04:27,324 --> 01:04:41,326
Scott: That's why the egg security is so separate and why X has all these crazy things that can happen is because it provides the mechanisms to do all these things and there's no policy as to whether you should do them or not.

1035
01:04:41,607 --> 01:04:41,828
Rym: Yep.

1036
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:45,424
Rym: And they really don't implement things willy-nilly.

1037
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:59,062
Rym: So someone might say, yeah, it'd be great if X just did transparency like this, but the people are working on X would say, if we're going to do transparency at all, we're going to do it in a way that is generically beneficial to everyone and specifically AIDS applications.

1038
01:04:59,183 --> 01:05:01,209
Scott: And that's, and that's why, right?

1039
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:15,180
Scott: Think all the fancy gooey eye candy stuff actually is encompass fusion, which is what they call it now with and the composite extension to X. It's not part of X. It's an extension you add on to X, which is the way it was intended to be developed.

1040
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:15,601
Scott: Yep.

1041
01:05:16,022 --> 01:05:30,483
Rym: If you want to do something crazy that doesn't have wide applicability outside of your specific application, your specific stuff, you're better off extending X for that rather than forcing everyone else to have this extra complexity added to the X, which is the base for everything.

1042
01:05:30,784 --> 01:05:41,486
Scott: And that's the other thing that's amazing about X is that any application that, you know, works in the gooey right suddenly has all these X features added onto it because they're not application specific.

1043
01:05:41,927 --> 01:05:43,292
Scott: It's just generalized.

1044
01:05:43,352 --> 01:05:44,657
Scott: Everything's at the lowest level.

1045
01:05:44,717 --> 01:05:52,003
Scott: So, you know, they made Firefox, you know, making Firefox didn't think about running Firefox onto a remote machine or anything like that.

1046
01:05:52,023 --> 01:05:53,710
Scott: They didn't think about it at all.

1047
01:05:54,151 --> 01:06:00,254
Scott: But because you run Firefox and Linux and X, suddenly it has all the features of X you can do to Firefox.

1048
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:02,522
Scott: You can do them all to any X application.

1049
01:06:02,562 --> 01:06:04,971
Scott: All these things just suddenly work perfectly.

1050
01:06:05,453 --> 01:06:06,497
Scott: No questions asked.

1051
01:06:06,778 --> 01:06:10,571
Scott: No extra programming on the part of the application developer necessary.

1052
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:12,076
Scott: It all just happens.

1053
01:06:12,658 --> 01:06:14,685
Scott: And you can accomplish amazing feats.

1054
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:18,820
Scott: And it's worth your time to investigate those amazing feats.

1055
01:06:25,383 --> 01:06:27,480
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1056
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,080
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1057
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:42,020
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

1058
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:48,305
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1059
01:06:48,807 --> 01:06:50,454
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1060
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,125
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1061
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:58,990
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1062
01:06:59,352 --> 01:07:04,486
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com.

1063
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:07,516
Scott: Or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1064
01:07:07,777 --> 01:07:11,074
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

1065
01:07:11,355 --> 01:07:16,497
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

1066
01:07:16,517 --> 01:07:19,870
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website which has everything.

1069
01:07:32,997 --> 01:07:40,780
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
