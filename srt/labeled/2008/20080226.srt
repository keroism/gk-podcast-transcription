1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,798
Rym: It's Tuesday, February 26th.

2
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,082
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:13,904
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:15,549
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:21,030
Rym: Tonight we bring you the lost episode of GeekNights as we review tickets to ride.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,217
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,668
Rym: Well, tonight's episode is a little special.

8
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:38,118
Rym: You might have remembered that right before Katsucon we did a show that was actually just hypnotoed for 20 minutes.

9
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:44,860
Rym: So we pulled it down and I put it back up, but Libsyn decided to cache it for like a week straight.

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:52,080
Rym: So there was no point at which I could upload and allow everyone to actually download the real episode.

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,514
Rym: Now luckily it wasn't a full episode anyway.

12
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:55,300
Rym: It was just a special.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,760
Rym: You know, we talked about ticket to ride a board game, but most of you didn't hear that episode because I eventually just pulled it down entirely and flushed out the Libsyn.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,589
Scott: Yeah, basically we made an episode of GeekNights.

15
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:07,773
Scott: We tried to upload it.

16
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:08,676
Scott: Rym screwed up.

17
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:09,920
Scott: It failed epically.

18
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,840
Scott: He just deleted the episode and took it off the internet.

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,848
Scott: It's like it never happened.

20
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:15,440
Rym: Because there was no other way to fix it.

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,428
Rym: So some of you have listened to this, most of you have not.

22
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,295
Scott: So now we're gonna put it back up.

23
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:24,440
Rym: By the power of magic and gray skull, I bring to you our episode on ticket to ride.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:32,539
Rym: But because that episode, you know, getting ready for Katsucon was just a special anyway, we're gonna record some news and thing of the day right now.

25
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:34,428
Rym: To kind of make up for that a little bit.

26
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:36,680
Scott: And then I'll go back to playing Professor Layton.

27
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:37,824
Rym: I don't know.

28
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:39,340
Rym: I'm gonna go back to playing with my new laptop.

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,402
Scott: Yeah, probably.

30
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:41,828
Scott: Probably what I would be doing if I was you.

31
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,500
Rym: Yeah, but in the news Scott can't make chili worth a goddamn.

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,064
Scott: Hey, alright, first of all.

33
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:47,330
Rym: That was some of the worst chili.

34
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:49,660
Scott: That chili wasn't that, first of all wasn't that bad.

35
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:52,215
Scott: It wasn't good, but it wasn't that bad.

36
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:52,899
Rym: I gotta say this.

37
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,340
Rym: I really like I try to be polite and I don't I don't want to lie to you though and say like oh it was okay.

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:07,155
Rym: That was the most unsatisf- you basically just made tomato paste with large chunks of chicken interspersed throughout.

39
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:08,600
Scott: Okay, first of all, right?

40
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:10,548
Scott: I tried to cut up the chicken.

41
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:12,920
Rym: I knew I had to cut the chicken up into like two pieces.

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,078
Rym: I knew I had two giant pieces of chicken sitting in a pot of hot tomato paste.

43
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:20,120
Scott: First of all, I knew I had to cut it small, right?

44
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:23,340
Scott: But I thought it would shrink so I cut it slightly too large, right?

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,415
Rym: Then on the direction- there were like eight pieces of chicken in there.

46
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:28,058
Scott: No, there were.

47
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:28,580
Scott: there were a lot.

48
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:31,071
Scott: But there weren't enough.

49
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:33,765
Scott: I should, for a second of all, I should have put in more chicken.

50
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:38,085
Scott: Like I cut up the chicken and I looked at it and I said that's enough but I should have cut up one more.

51
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:44,106
Rym: I think more importantly you should have put something other than tomato paste and beans.

52
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:45,330
Scott: Alright, hold on, hold on.

53
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:50,224
Scott: So then I'm reading the directions right on the package and That's your first mistake.

54
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:53,437
Scott: It said for more tomato-y chili, and I said that's what I like.

55
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:54,099
Scott: It said do this.

56
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:55,705
Scott: I shouldn't have done that.

57
00:02:56,006 --> 00:03:00,180
Rym: Well one, what you did is you took nice diced tomatoes, right?

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,572
Rym: But because of the way you cooked them, you just turned them into tomato paste.

59
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:05,560
Rym: You could have just used a can of tomato paste.

60
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,385
Scott: Well, okay, here's the other thing, right?

61
00:03:07,827 --> 00:03:09,452
Scott: So I'm cooking it, right?

62
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,580
Scott: And you know, it was it was going alright.

63
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,903
Scott: And then it said hey, if you want thicker chili add this flour and then add some water and I'm like, okay I will do that.

64
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:24,908
Scott: So all you did was take the already too thick tomato paste because it wasn't thick when I added that but it was too thick after it.

65
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,159
Rym: That's because you reduced it too much.

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,966
Scott: There was definitely too much reduction.

67
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:30,920
Rym: And also because you're supposed to have, I don't know, peppers.

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,945
Scott: Okay, first of all, right?

69
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,417
Scott: First of all, I gotta tell you the directions didn't say to add that.

70
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:38,624
Rym: But second of all, Don't follow the directions.

71
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:44,080
Scott: Second of all, I realized after I already had the stuff going on that I should have done that.

72
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,439
Scott: But then it was too late.

73
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,173
Scott: You got to do that first when you're like, you know, browning the or cooking the meats.

74
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:50,940
Rym: Actually, you can just toss it in at any time.

75
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,608
Rym: It'll be fine.

76
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,520
Scott: No, it's no good.

77
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:57,014
Rym: Having made many successful chilies, it is not hard to make chili.

78
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:58,078
Scott: Yeah, it's not hard.

79
00:03:58,098 --> 00:04:00,486
Scott: But anyway, Well, it doesn't make you the chili.

80
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:03,716
Rym: First of all, you presented evidence to the contrary of it not being hard.

81
00:04:03,737 --> 00:04:04,740
Scott: I made good chili before.

82
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:09,297
Rym: This was like, the chili in the can is better.

83
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:09,760
Rym: I'm sorry.

84
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:12,540
Scott: I'm not gonna say this is a great chili.

85
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,482
Scott: I can't lie to you.

86
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,849
Scott: It wasn't as bad as you're saying it is.

87
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,954
Scott: And next time it'll be awesome because I have learned.

88
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,940
Rym: Do you want me as a man to lie to you and say yes, Scott?

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,988
Rym: That was an okay chili.

90
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:22,700
Rym: I don't feel bad for having eaten it.

91
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:27,840
Rym: It did not entirely unsatisfied me to the point that I feel like I should eat a different dinner.

92
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:29,600
Scott: It wasn't that bad.

93
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:32,428
Scott: It was just a little bad.

94
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:35,778
Scott: Anyway, speaking next time, I'm gonna make the awesomest chili.

95
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:36,360
Scott: I have no idea.

96
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,982
Scott: We'll see.

97
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:40,980
Scott: Plus, I think that the the shotgun really is superior to that the other bag.

98
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:43,914
Rym: You just you just spice chili.

99
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:44,839
Rym: You don't need a bag.

100
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:45,903
Scott: I'm just saying.

101
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:46,987
Rym: You just just make it.

102
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,520
Rym: The bag of chili powder is just chili powder.

103
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,525
Scott: No, there's more to it.

104
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:54,052
Rym: Yeah, not much more.

105
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:54,413
Rym: It's not.

106
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,900
Scott: It's all about the number of alarms.

107
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,849
Rym: And you can just kind of wing that.

108
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:58,854
Scott: Don't worry about it.

109
00:04:58,874 --> 00:04:59,698
Scott: Next time, it's gonna be...

110
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,502
Rym: Ah, judge it.

111
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,820
Rym: After what happened today, I think I feel I think I feel justified in fact worrying about it.

112
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:05,586
Scott: What the hell?

113
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,338
Scott: You think because?

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,217
Scott: Zomom, I made I made a great chili last time.

115
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:12,679
Rym: When was that?

116
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:14,044
Scott: Weeks ago.

117
00:05:14,345 --> 00:05:15,107
Rym: Weeks ago.

118
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:16,090
Rym: Oh, was it?

119
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:17,675
Rym: Was it really weeks ago?

120
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,040
Scott: It was some number of weeks ago.

121
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,278
Rym: Yes, a number of weeks ago.

122
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,087
Rym: Probably a number greater than 50.

123
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:25,110
Scott: No, not that many.

124
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:29,623
Rym: Anyway, in other sad news, Gen Con.

125
00:05:29,924 --> 00:05:31,390
Rym: Now, there are two parts to this story.

126
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,724
Rym: I'm sure a lot of you have heard rumors or seen some articles, but point the first.

127
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:36,828
Rym: Gen Con.

128
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,093
Rym: That venerable old...

129
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:40,562
Scott: I feel like we talked about this already, but I'm not sure.

130
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:50,705
Rym: That venerable old convention of people who like to play a role playing games and such at filed for bankruptcy for various reasons.

131
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:51,908
Rym: Now, point the second.

132
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:54,113
Rym: Actually, only one reason.

133
00:05:54,474 --> 00:05:56,459
Rym: The fact that Lucasfilm is suing them.

134
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,645
Rym: Now, the details...

135
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:02,390
Scott: It's hard to get sued by Lucasfilm.

136
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,820
Scott: I mean, you know, as all the bad things you can say about them, right?

137
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:07,467
Scott: The only good thing.

138
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:09,200
Scott: Well, there's some good things you can say about them, too.

139
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,240
Scott: But for all the bad things you can say about Lucas and his empire is that he kind of lets people make Star Wars shit.

140
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,060
Scott: So, you know, like he lets people make fan films and he lets people make fan arts and he, you know, he lets you go nuts with the Star Wars.

141
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Rym: Well, a lot of people are really kind of rallying to Gen Con side at all those bastards.

142
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,860
Scott: Yeah, he lets those people do their costumes at the conventions with their...

143
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:38,900
Rym: But, I'm curious as to what actually happened because like any sort of lawsuits like this don't just suddenly spring up.

144
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,440
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you got to do something serious to get them to sue you.

145
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,860
Rym: It's more that a company like this wouldn't just out of the blue file a lawsuit.

146
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:52,340
Rym: There is obviously been some sort of ongoing dialogue between Gen Con and Lucasfilm.

147
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:57,520
Rym: They were unable to resolve their differences and Lucasfilm having no other recourse has filed this.

148
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,580
Rym: Now, the four complaints are very interesting.

149
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:08,520
Rym: Number one is that Gen Con has failed to uphold his legal obligations in terms of financial reporting, accounting and payments to Lucasfilm.

150
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:18,000
Rym: Now, this is mostly in regard to Celebration 4, which was a Star Wars convention run by Gen Con or something like that.

151
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,060
Scott: So, they ran a Star Wars convention.

152
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,640
Scott: Apparently, Gen Con is a convention running company and they were supposed to pay Lucasfilm for the right to run the Star Wars convention.

153
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,600
Rym: It's more complicated than that, that you could read the full complaint if you want.

154
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,260
Rym: But I didn't even care about Celebration 4.

155
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,080
Rym: I barely even care about Gen Con anymore.

156
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,900
Scott: You care about Gen Con even a little?

157
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,300
Rym: I used to really want to go and as time went on, I cared less and less.

158
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,160
Rym: I never cared.

159
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,765
Rym: Why not?

160
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:44,879
Rym: It's a big gaming con.

161
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,118
Scott: There's better gaming cons.

162
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,999
Rym: When was the last time you went to a gaming con?

163
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,694
Scott: Too long ago.

164
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:50,966
Rym: Point the second.

165
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,455
Rym: Now, this one's extra interesting.

166
00:07:52,496 --> 00:07:53,180
Rym: This is Lucasfilm.

167
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:53,890
Rym: Going to PAX.

168
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:54,580
Scott: PAX is all that matters.

169
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,440
Rym: This is Lucasfilm twisting the dagger a little bit.

170
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,480
Rym: Gen Con did not give auction proceeds to Make-A-Wish Foundation as they had agreed to.

171
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,500
Scott: I'm not a fan of Make-A-Wish Foundation.

172
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:04,978
Rym: Why not?

173
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:06,739
Rym: Well, what do you have?

174
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,358
Rym: What do you have against me?

175
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,100
Rym: First, you make bad chili and now you malign the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

176
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:22,627
Scott: Basically, Make-A-Wish Foundation, you know, I mean, you know, it's sort of hard and it's sort of it's very difficult to take a stand against a charitable organization that helps sick children.

177
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:24,040
Scott: That's that's difficult.

178
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,300
Rym: But Scott, I guess, is up to the challenge of harming sick children's dreams.

179
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,715
Scott: No, but the Make-A-Wish Foundation gets a lot of money to pay.

180
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:32,477
Scott: very like.

181
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:33,962
Scott: most of what they do is like they.

182
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:38,059
Scott: they'll very often, for example, get a famous person to visit a kid in the hospital.

183
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,820
Rym: Now, do you know this just from the few news reports you see?

184
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,497
Rym: Do you actually know about the Make-A-Wish organization and what they do on a day to day basis?

185
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,220
Scott: No, I don't know what they do on a day to day basis.

186
00:08:48,082 --> 00:08:55,058
Scott: But I just think that, you know, if you're going to help sick children, you could spend the money on, you know, medicine instead of.

187
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,580
Rym: Well, I guess we should get rid of Penny Arcade's charity because obviously it's just entertainment because that's because that actually helps.

188
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,840
Scott: You're distracted from your pain when you play video games, this studies.

189
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:08,740
Rym: And so getting to meet Michael Jackson doesn't distract you from your pain.

190
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,059
Scott: No, it adds more pain.

191
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:11,359
Scott: You just don't know it yet.

192
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:20,780
Rym: OK, well, I guess Scott is entitled to his somewhat uninformed opinion on the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

193
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:22,140
Scott: I'm not I'm not against them.

194
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,800
Scott: It's not like Make-A-Wish Foundation is evil.

195
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,319
Scott: I just think there are better charities.

196
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:26,559
Rym: I don't know.

197
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,820
Rym: Just you kind of went out of your way there to go after that.

198
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:34,140
Rym: But the fact that that is an issue in this lawsuit, I find very interesting.

199
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:35,019
Scott: Yeah, I mean, come on.

200
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,300
Scott: Even if it's the Make-A-Wish Foundation, you know, it doesn't matter what charity is.

201
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,180
Scott: It could be the Joe Bob charity.

202
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:46,819
Scott: If you say you're going to have a charity auction and then you don't give the charity auction money to the charity, that is low.

203
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:48,880
Scott: That is so low.

204
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,860
Rym: Gen Con did not give Lucasfilm their share of the auction proceeds because apparently something must have happened.

205
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:01,500
Scott: They probably were auctioning off goods donated by Lucasfilm, like sells or, you know, movie film or something.

206
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,134
Rym: I like Adam IV.

207
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,400
Rym: This is this is very much the lawyer part.

208
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,636
Rym: Gen Con did all of this unjustly.

209
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:11,880
Scott: OK, I don't know what that's supposed to mean.

210
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:26,580
Rym: My guess, my take on this, because I've seen this happen with other conventions before, especially fan conventions are very often run by people who are not necessarily full of business acumen and may or may not actually just be banned.

211
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,060
Scott: They're very unprofessional.

212
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:45,040
Rym: I have this sneaking suspicion that what actually happened is that Jen, that the organization Gen Con that attempted to run Celebration for did not read fully the contract that they may have signed with Lucasfilm regarding whatever.

213
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:49,700
Rym: And when confronted, were unable to cover their end of the bargain.

214
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,939
Scott: That's a good guess as any.

215
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,399
Rym: That is my guess.

216
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:53,318
Scott: Makes sense to me.

217
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,080
Rym: But regardless of all that, they claim that this is not like everyone who declares bankruptcy.

218
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,600
Rym: This is not the end of Gen Con.

219
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:10,500
Rym: This is simply a temporary measure to gain protection while they resort their finances, go with their more profitable venues and hopefully get out of bankruptcy.

220
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:18,037
Rym: Yeah, well, actually, all their events are continuing to be scheduled and are planned to proceed.

221
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,420
Rym: Yeah, but even so, I mean, that is the way bankruptcy is supposed to work.

222
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,859
Rym: You're supposed to be able to get out of bankruptcy.

223
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:36,518
Scott: I would like to see statistics just like overall, like, you know, companies and people like separately, like the percentage of people in companies going into bankruptcy and then how many of them get out.

224
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:45,199
Scott: That would be very interesting to see, like, because I mean, technically, shouldn't you try to like raise the percentage of people getting out of bankruptcy, like as high as possible?

225
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:51,279
Scott: I mean, if everyone who goes into bankruptcy stays bankrupt, then is bankruptcy really working as a law?

226
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:52,078
Scott: Not so much.

227
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:53,517
Rym: All right.

228
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,079
Rym: So anyway, what do you got the news?

229
00:11:55,421 --> 00:12:00,176
Rym: Because as much as I'd like to talk more in depth about this, I really don't care that much.

230
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,079
Scott: No, I really don't care.

231
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,713
Scott: OK, so by the commando, which we can talk about a whole lot, it's pretty much like the only non we.

232
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,818
Scott: Well, actually, it's coming to the PC.

233
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:14,640
Scott: So, you know, I guess it doesn't count, but it's one of the video games we can talk about.

234
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,017
Scott: that's on the systems we don't have.

235
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:23,964
Scott: Anyway, by the commando, rearmed, not the 3D by the commando remake, but the remake of the original.

236
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:31,760
Rym: by the commando with newer graphics and more modern control, which I am much more looking forward to than the actual bionic commando that is coming out.

237
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:32,116
Scott: Right.

238
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,014
Scott: By the commando, rearmed is coming out to the PS3, the 360 and the PC.

239
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:37,659
Scott: Right.

240
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,660
Scott: However, it is going to use the PS3's remote play feature.

241
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:52,859
Scott: If you are not familiar with this remote play feature, basically what this means is let's say you go and you buy bionic commando rearmed for the PS3.

242
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,160
Scott: You sit down at your PS3 in front of your HDTV and you play bionic commando rearmed.

243
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,100
Scott: But now you want to go lay in bed and play bionic commando rearmed.

244
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,039
Scott: You get your PSP, you go lay in bed and you're playing bionic commando rearmed because your PS3 sends the game to the PSP.

245
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:13,279
Scott: That's pretty cool.

246
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:24,800
Scott: Now, this is significant because number one, this is one of the first games and probably the first non Sony game to do this, to take take advantage of this feature.

247
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:31,920
Scott: Two, this feature is actually being used and it works and it's useful and cool.

248
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:39,462
Scott: And three, the DS, which is probably like a billion times more potential for a feature like this.

249
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:44,560
Scott: that is definitely possible that it's technologically definitely possible.

250
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,483
Scott: One hundred percent.

251
00:13:45,503 --> 00:13:50,744
Scott: Nintendo hasn't done shit, of course, again, because Nintendo doesn't have to like.

252
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:54,060
Rym: Nintendo has always been able to do throughout almost the entirety of their existence.

253
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:57,980
Rym: They can just laugh all the way to the bank because they're making so much money.

254
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:02,780
Rym: They could just cease operations and have already made money off of all their products out there.

255
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,260
Scott: Yeah, they have the high potential that is unfulfilled.

256
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,540
Scott: But meanwhile, you know, they're high potential that is unfulfilled.

257
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,251
Scott: OK, you know, it's it's still.

258
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,500
Scott: they got good stuff going on.

259
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,778
Scott: I mean, the Smash Brothers alone.

260
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,638
Scott: I mean, come on.

261
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:13,912
Scott: Right.

262
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:25,795
Scott: But Sony, on the other hand, you know, even though they sort of got off to a really bad start, you know, and I still probably would never buy a PS3, the PSP is starting to look OK.

263
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:40,120
Scott: You know, the pad upons not looking as good as it did when it was not because Tyco, if any arcade maligned it slightly and briefly after a a short encounter with it, his word me carries a lot of weight.

264
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:40,654
Scott: What can you know?

265
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:40,820
Rym: what?

266
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,240
Rym: As much as I like gave in Tyco and agree with most of what they say until Yahtzee weighs in, I got nothing.

267
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:56,020
Rym: Man, if Yahtzee weighs in on Pat upon, that'd be awesome because I to this day, I've never found a single statement I can disagree with regarding video games that has come forth from that man's mouth.

268
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,720
Scott: I'm not saying I'm not saying that I will agree 100 percent that Yahtzee, his word carries like 10 times the weight of Tyco's word.

269
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,319
Scott: Yet Tyco's word, it is not an empty word.

270
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:13,080
Scott: You know, that's you know, anyway, point is PS3, PSP is a little bit going on there.

271
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:13,586
Rym: Yeah.

272
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:15,400
Rym: Well, it is amazing.

273
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,620
Scott: It's a little bit of command.

274
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,580
Rym: It's the first time there's ever been a second place.

275
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:19,259
Rym: Yeah.

276
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:25,045
Rym: And the fact that it's continuing to be a strong second place hopefully will light a fire under Nintendo someday.

277
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:29,430
Scott: to they actually seem to be fulfilling the potential that they have.

278
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,558
Scott: Their potential is less.

279
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,519
Scott: But the fact that they fulfill it, it's like Nintendo has a big like a gallon jug and Sony has a half gallon jug.

280
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,040
Scott: But Nintendo's gallon jug only has a quart of liquid in it.

281
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,460
Scott: But Sony's half gallon jug is overflowing.

282
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:48,540
Rym: Man, I'd rather have a gallon of Sony's liquid than that chili.

283
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:50,080
Scott: What the fuck?

284
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,519
Scott: Leave my chili.

285
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,820
Rym: Your chili wasn't that good.

286
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,217
Rym: I got it.

287
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:52,885
Rym: I can't.

288
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:54,159
Rym: I can't let it slide.

289
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,980
Scott: It definitely wasn't that good, but it wasn't like horrible poison.

290
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:01,519
Rym: We'll get a neutral opinion later.

291
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,765
Scott: It was a. it was an.

292
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:06,460
Scott: actually next time it'll be a chili.

293
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:07,576
Scott: I promise.

294
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,680
Rym: A bunch of my coworkers are buying PS3 is a lot of people are buying them now just because it's the cheapest Blu-ray player on the market.

295
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:13,951
Scott: Yeah.

296
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,280
Rym: I mean, the the PS2 run that won that slap fight.

297
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:25,149
Scott: Well, the PS2 was incredibly popular and it exploded mostly because, you know, at the time DVD had already won.

298
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:30,100
Scott: DVD was something people already were buying into and everyone wanted a player, but players are still expensive.

299
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:33,420
Scott: And the PS2 came out and was the cheapest DVD player.

300
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,760
Scott: So people said, hey, it's a DVD player and a PS2 can't beat that.

301
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:39,180
Scott: And then the PS2 exploded.

302
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:41,200
Scott: But now everyone has a DVD player.

303
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:41,938
Scott: They're 40 bucks.

304
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,120
Scott: So Sony said, hey, we can do the same thing with Blu-ray.

305
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:57,180
Scott: And, you know, the problem was is it was a little different situation because first of all, there was a competitor to the Blu-ray and Blu-ray and HD DVD together are not commanding nearly the market share the DVD.

306
00:16:57,401 --> 00:17:01,060
Scott: And when the PS2 came out, DVD had already been a success.

307
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,500
Scott: It was already poised to take over the market.

308
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,499
Scott: You were already in a situation where people wanted DVDs.

309
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,763
Scott: They were stuck with.

310
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:11,219
Scott: there was still VHS is in the stores because people still had VCRs.

311
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:18,259
Scott: But the stores were, you know, it was at like the perfect moment when DVDs were exploding onto the scene.

312
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:26,880
Scott: This was like they tried to force the explosion instead of waiting, you know, for the bomb to go off and then sort of riding the explosion to get a double jump.

313
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:30,780
Scott: They sort of like put the bomb down and hope that it would explode.

314
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,479
Scott: And it still hasn't exploded yet.

315
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:44,049
Rym: But anyway, we'll get some things the day out and then we'll air that last episode of GeekNights.

316
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:55,470
Rym: So my thing of the day, this is real short, real sweet video of the guy who wrote the portal song is still alive, performing it in rock band with some other people who are moderately famous.

317
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:58,090
Rym: And the performance is pretty ass.

318
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,290
Rym: I got to say the video is not that great.

319
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:16,790
Rym: All I want to point out is that it's amazing the kind of currency that the still alive song and portal pull, because you can have like you could go to a convention, a gaming con and just go up on stage and just start reciting random lyrics from that song.

320
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,109
Rym: And the crowd would be cheering and screaming.

321
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:18,907
Scott: Yeah.

322
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,610
Scott: I mean, this is such an example of that.

323
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:27,330
Scott: Yeah, it's a good song, you know, but people are going way crazier over it that I don't feel it that strongly.

324
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,410
Rym: That's because portal was that way.

325
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:30,849
Rym: People are still making cake jokes.

326
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,470
Scott: It's a I know people just like at Kasukan.

327
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,849
Scott: I was sick most of the time.

328
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,950
Scott: Yet people were yelling, you know, cake is a lie.

329
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,650
Scott: Cake is a lie.

330
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,190
Scott: And I'm like, it's not funny.

331
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,033
Scott: It doesn't.

332
00:18:40,455 --> 00:18:43,010
Scott: it's not a social currency.

333
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,990
Rym: People are buying it and saying, look, I am a fan of that thing.

334
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:47,870
Rym: Check it out.

335
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:51,450
Scott: I wore a portal shirt one day because I am a fan of that thing.

336
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,850
Rym: But I used to be that way.

337
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:55,310
Rym: Don't pretend you're beyond that.

338
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,670
Rym: There was a time when we would walk around.

339
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,286
Rym: Oh, no, I'm not.

340
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,709
Scott: I'm not beyond that.

341
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,430
Scott: It's just this particular one.

342
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,490
Scott: The yelling of how is this different than yelling Leroy?

343
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,090
Scott: It's not any different.

344
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,349
Scott: It's just this particular one doesn't do it for me.

345
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:08,229
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

346
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,447
Rym: But Leroy still does.

347
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,590
Scott: Oh, Leroy Jenkins.

348
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,549
Scott: Even though I hate World of Warcraft portal, which I love, but the meme no good.

349
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:16,048
Scott: World of Warcraft.

350
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,026
Scott: I hate the meme.

351
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:18,106
Scott: Two thumbs up.

352
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:18,869
Rym: All right.

353
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,046
Rym: So anyway, what do you got for me?

354
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:23,910
Scott: So these guys, they're crazy Japanese people, of course.

355
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:38,510
Scott: They took Final Fantasy 7 and they made pretty much the whole game, not on the SNES, not on, you know, I guess it was originally on the PlayStation, but on the Atari 7800.

356
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:38,789
Scott: I wish.

357
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:48,190
Scott: No, on the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Famicom, the original Famicom Final Fantasy 7, it basically make the whole game pretty much the whole game.

358
00:19:48,310 --> 00:20:16,030
Scott: I mean, there's some characters missing and some side stuff missing, but they've pretty much made all of the major plot, all of the major characters, you know, all the, you know, major scenes, all the major places, you know, the whole game, the bad guys from beginning to end, the most of the music, you know, it's as good as it could be done on the NES, you know, and it's, it's Final Fantasy 7 and it's on the final.

359
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:22,290
Rym: I'll warn you, as cool as this is, the video is not very entertaining to watch because it's very slow and full of a lot of combat.

360
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,430
Scott: Well, there's a lot of other videos and, you know, screenshots and all sorts of things.

361
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,130
Scott: I'll use a ROM.

362
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,569
Scott: You can download the ROM and play it yourself if you really want to.

363
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,830
Scott: But, you know, this is on every gaming website.

364
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:45,350
Scott: You know, I just had to talk about it just because it's so, you know, they took a game, you know, like a 3D game from, you know, one time period and they ported the game to an older engine.

365
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:54,590
Scott: It's kind of a, it's quite a feat and it's definitely, even if it's not worth playing, you know, cause it isn't Japanese, I'm sure there'll be an English translation eventually.

366
00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:00,449
Rym: But hey, I played a good chunk of Final Fantasies 2 and 3, not in Japanese because I didn't have the right character.

367
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:01,989
Scott: But with bad, bad translations.

368
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:13,990
Rym: No, but, well, it was translated up until I walked into the first town and talked to some ninja and the ninja said gobbledy googity gobbledy sword sword gobbledy orb sword.

369
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:15,029
Scott: Awesome.

370
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:16,289
Rym: And I said, fuck.

371
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:18,070
Rym: And I kept playing for a while.

372
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:22,328
Rym: I kept playing that game for a while before I gave up because not knowing what people say makes Final Fantasy hard.

373
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:23,349
Scott: Real hard.

374
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,141
Scott: Yeah.

375
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:25,189
Scott: What do I do?

376
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,108
Scott: Where do I go next?

377
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,907
Rym: Especially since that game had a talk to people to get the keywords to ask other people to learn other things.

378
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:32,758
Scott: Yeah.

379
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:34,830
Scott: But anyway, you should check this out.

380
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:35,709
Scott: It's pretty amazing.

381
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,590
Scott: It's everywhere on the internet, whatever.

382
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:43,470
Rym: So thus, without further ado, I present to you the lost episode of GeekNights, where we review Ticket to Ride.

383
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,850
Rym: I don't remember what else we say.

384
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,050
Rym: I don't remember anything from this episode.

385
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:47,929
Rym: I hope you like it.

386
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:51,910
Rym: For the uninitiated, you might wonder, how come there is no music right now?

387
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,150
Rym: How come Rym's just talking?

388
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,230
Rym: That means it's time.

389
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,170
Rym: It's another GeekNights special.

390
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,650
Scott: I love how we use the word special and special is supposed to be a good thing.

391
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,310
Scott: It's a positive word, special.

392
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,370
Scott: But really, a special episode is where we're lazy and the episode sucks and doesn't have a news or thing of the day or anything.

393
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,650
Rym: Special means for whatever reason, we're tired or busy or preparing for Katsu-kan.

394
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,810
Rym: So as a result, we don't put together a whole show.

395
00:22:15,952 --> 00:22:16,890
Rym: We kind of just do something.

396
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:24,650
Rym: If this is your first experience with GeekNights, I highly recommend you listen to any other episode that does not include the word special in the title.

397
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,050
Scott: Well, this isn't a bad episode.

398
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:29,910
Scott: It's just that it's not going to familiarize you with the format.

399
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,349
Rym: It is not representative of what GeekNights is.

400
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:38,265
Rym: Much like when I listened to another podcast a long time ago and I remember telling Scott who would recommend it to me, "Man, that thing

401
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:38,730
Rym: sucked.".

402
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:44,950
Rym: And we eventually discovered that I listened to the one random episode that happened to have had two guest hosts.

403
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:45,074
Rym: Yeah.

404
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:53,850
Scott: Is it sort of like, imagine if you meet someone for the first time, they make their first impression on you when they're completely plastered.

405
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:54,807
Scott: That's what this is.

406
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:59,089
Rym: That's kind of like when I met Daryl Surratt the first time.

407
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,369
Scott: Something like that.

408
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:01,829
Scott: All right.

409
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:07,170
Scott: So Katsu-kan that we're preparing for is this weekend as in February what?

410
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:10,228
Rym: In the Omnishorm Hotel in Washington, D.C.

411
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:14,822
Rym: on the weekend of Friday, February 15th through Sunday, February 17th.

412
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:19,424
Rym: Yes.

413
00:23:20,236 --> 00:23:20,889
Scott: Not any other year.

414
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,310
Scott: I don't know what you could be listening to this in like 2010.

415
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,250
Scott: How far do I know, right?

416
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,850
Rym: But yeah, we are going to be there doing crazy amounts of stuff.

417
00:23:28,612 --> 00:23:31,290
Rym: If you don't like anime, cause this isn't anime-con nominally, but one.

418
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,930
Rym: Now, if you're a geek, Katsu-kan is absolutely awesome.

419
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:38,970
Scott: Because, first of all, other anime-cons, the gaming room, not so good.

420
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,350
Scott: Katsu-kan, go just for the video game room.

421
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,924
Scott: It's worth it.

422
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,129
Rym: Especially, remember, the video game room at Katsu-kan is actually two rooms.

423
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,630
Rym: One room is like any other con's video game room, except that it's run awesomely.

424
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,029
Rym: And the other room is our room.

425
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,871
Rym: By our room, I mean at the front of the room is us playing music and chilling with our Atari 7800.

426
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:03,210
Scott: Oh, no, he's busting out the kaboom.

427
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:03,909
Rym: The rest.

428
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,089
Scott: I'm gonna bust out the pitfall.

429
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,260
Rym: The rest of the room is, let's see, these are arcade cabinets for games like, I don't know.

430
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:12,067
Scott: Rampart.

431
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:13,486
Rym: Rampart.

432
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,990
Rym: Street Fighter 1.

433
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,730
Scott: Root Beer Tapper.

434
00:24:17,193 --> 00:24:17,890
Rym: Oh, Root Beer Tapper.

435
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:18,323
Rym: Dig Dug.

436
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,770
Rym: Root Beer Tapper is the best fucking- Circus Tamer.

437
00:24:21,153 --> 00:24:21,467
Rym: Oh, man.

438
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,110
Scott: Rampart.

439
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:23,748
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

440
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:26,070
Scott: Rampart again.

441
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:32,208
Rym: Seriously, Katsu-kan is like the esteemed convention for esteemed gentlemen who happen to be geeks.

442
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:35,069
Rym: And if you like video games, Katsu-kan is going to be up your alley.

443
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:35,946
Scott: Rampart.

444
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:37,530
Rym: But anyway.

445
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,530
Scott: How many times do we have to say Rampart do you think before it's funny again?

446
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,530
Rym: We've done a show on Rampart.

447
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:42,188
Scott: Oh, did we?

448
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:43,208
Rym: We did, didn't we?

449
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:43,967
Rym: We better have.

450
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,409
Rym: Surround castle to stay alive, Jinx.

451
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:48,283
Scott: Yeah, okay.

452
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,749
Scott: Good job, Blue Commander.

453
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,550
Rym: Red Commander needs food badly.

454
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,485
Rym: Wrong game.

455
00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,910
Scott: They might have the gauntlet working this year.

456
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,950
Rym: Run, run, Red Commander, run.

457
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:03,170
Scott: They had a gauntlet last year.

458
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,088
Scott: Wasn't working too well.

459
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,350
Rym: As in it wasn't working.

460
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,250
Rym: You know what they should have?

461
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,409
Rym: I want the old D&D game.

462
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,990
Scott: Oh, the walk sideways one.

463
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:15,849
Scott: And if that was on free play, oh my God, I'd be clericking it up using my- Sticks to snakes.

464
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:16,590
Scott: Sticks to snakes.

465
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:17,209
Rym: Nothing but.

466
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:20,810
Scott: Oh, and also, of course, my aww, turn on dead.

467
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:24,649
Rym: You know that aww I think is the same aww from Saab.

468
00:25:25,512 --> 00:25:28,290
Scott: Oh, they brought that or the Ninja Turtles or the Simpsons.

469
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:37,970
Scott: Yeah, but I- All four of those games, the D&D one, the Simpsons, the X-Men, and the Ninja Turtles lined up with free play.

470
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,950
Scott: I would not move from that spot.

471
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,710
Scott: Like Scott, it's time to do this panel and beat the Ninja Turtles.

472
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,850
Rym: Main event's the late show.

473
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,509
Rym: You're interviewing- Eh, fuck it, whatever.

474
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,389
Scott: Someone else- Ninja Turtles, man.

475
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:47,968
Scott: Ninja Turtles.

476
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:49,609
Rym: All right.

477
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,730
Rym: Right, so Katsu-Kan.

478
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,590
Rym: As a result, we totally copped out tonight.

479
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,550
Rym: We're going to talk about a board game real quick.

480
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,768
Rym: There's not a lot to say about it.

481
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,069
Rym: Ticket to ride.

482
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,668
Scott: All right.

483
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,107
Rym: It's fun.

484
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:07,110
Scott: Ticket to ride is this game that sort of busted out and became really popular a year or so ago, maybe two years ago, and I can't even keep track anymore.

485
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:21,410
Scott: The reason it busted out and so popular is because it has many game mechanics that basically they make the game really fun, and they could be used to make the game really good, and in some ways they are, but in some ways they aren't.

486
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,570
Rym: Yeah, I mean, think of it this way.

487
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:38,870
Rym: The real secret behind this game's success is that it's so incredibly simple to learn, incredibly accessible, and it's a train game, but before you go, "Ah," and stop listening and shoot yourself, there are, in fact, three different kinds of train game in the world.

488
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,149
Scott: Whoa, three now.

489
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:53,310
Rym: Now, Ticket to Ride is the special last kind I'm going to talk about, but when most people think of train games, they think of games that involve wax paper, crease pencils, crayons, and crying.

490
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,750
Rym: Those games require a special kind of person to play.

491
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,730
Scott: They do, indeed.

492
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,850
Rym: Then there's games like Railroad Tycoon or Age of Steam.

493
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,110
Rym: I was about to say if you're a little-- The masochistic Railroad Tycoon.

494
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:13,970
Rym: Probably the only game I've ever played in my life that has not a single catch-up mechanism whatsoever, and in fact, kicks you out if you're not doing well enough.

495
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:15,829
Scott: We should learn how to play it.

496
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:17,388
Rym: I did learn how to play it.

497
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,189
Scott: I'm lost.

498
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,550
Scott: Learn how to play it well.

499
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,420
Scott: All right.

500
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:26,968
Rym: So this is a special third kind of game, and we're starting to see more of these every now and then.

501
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,067
Rym: They're starting to creep in.

502
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,249
Scott: Third in Texas is very similar, mechanic-wise.

503
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,090
Rym: Yes, but basically, it's not really a train game.

504
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:35,790
Rym: It looks like a train game.

505
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,090
Rym: It's themed like a train game.

506
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,030
Scott: It smells like a train game.

507
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,410
Rym: The board is trains.

508
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,370
Rym: You take little plastic trains, and you make routes, and you think, "Hey, it's a train

509
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:42,523
Rym: game.".

510
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:48,150
Rym: No, this is actually a card game with a complex score-keeping mechanism built into the board.

511
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:50,102
Scott: That is mostly true.

512
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,390
Rym: It is a set-building card game, and there is not a lot else to it.

513
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,450
Rym: There's a little bit of tactical stuff.

514
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,569
Scott: That's quite similar to what was it?

515
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,682
Scott: Was the Mario Nostrum?

516
00:27:58,703 --> 00:27:59,229
Scott: was the game?

517
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,010
Rym: I think so.

518
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:02,889
Scott: That was also the card game where the boats didn't really mean that much.

519
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:09,510
Rym: But then there's, like, Moitre and Verator that just straight up only have cards.

520
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,049
Scott: Yeah, these aren't too similar to those.

521
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,910
Rym: I know, but I point out that those games didn't sell so well.

522
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,530
Scott: Well, Moitre and Verator were never put out in English.

523
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:16,928
Scott: Yeah.

524
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:18,450
Scott: They sold well in Germany.

525
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,190
Rym: Everything sells well in Germany.

526
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:20,870
Scott: Right, anyway.

527
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:26,629
Scott: Yeah, so the way Ticket to Ride works, basically, is -- and this is also the reason the game is so fun.

528
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,769
Scott: I'll get to after -- you'll see, maybe, when I explain the rules, right?

529
00:28:30,152 --> 00:28:32,750
Scott: There's a board, and the board is a bunch of cities, right?

530
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:38,109
Scott: And the cities are connected with tracks of different colors, some of them gray, some of, you know, colors, right?

531
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:39,509
Scott: And there's some cards.

532
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,990
Scott: And at the beginning of the game, everyone gets these routes, right?

533
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,989
Scott: These route cards.

534
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:45,250
Scott: And the route cards are special.

535
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:51,881
Scott: The route card will say something like New York, Chicago, 10 points, or New York, LA, 25 points, right?

536
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,569
Scott: Because that's a lot harder, right?

537
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:56,570
Scott: And you're trying to fulfill those routes.

538
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,530
Scott: You want to have your trains of your color going from one of the city to the other.

539
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:13,150
Scott: And what I usually do to win the game is I'll have, like, a big route and then some small routes, and I will try to, you know, in getting the big route, also get the small route.

540
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:22,629
Scott: So, for example, let's say I have two routes and one of them is New York, LA, and one of them is, I don't know, Oklahoma City to Chicago.

541
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,728
Rym: Sault Ste.

542
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,390
Rym: Marie.

543
00:29:25,572 --> 00:29:26,127
Scott: To Sault Ste.

544
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:26,764
Scott: Marie, right?

545
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,569
Scott: So I would go from New York to Sault Ste.

546
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,289
Scott: Marie to Oklahoma City to LA.

547
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:34,630
Scott: That way I can accomplish both with the minimal number of trains.

548
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,410
Scott: It's the basic strategy of the game, right?

549
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:37,649
Rym: Well, strategy.

550
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,670
Rym: I mean, it's one of those games, right?

551
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,810
Rym: Pretty much the strategy.

552
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:42,870
Scott: It's kind of obvious.

553
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:47,330
Rym: You look at your routes and you think, what is the most optimal way to get these?

554
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:54,928
Rym: And then you think, all right, now, in addition to that, who is going to be trying to get in my way and whose way should I get in?

555
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:55,850
Scott: Yeah.

556
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,968
Scott: And you basically try to accomplish your routes in the least amount of time possible, the least number of resources.

557
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:04,270
Scott: Right now, on your turn, you have four options.

558
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,889
Scott: You can either draw train cards.

559
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,550
Scott: You can put trains on the board by spending train cards.

560
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:11,570
Scott: You can draw new routes.

561
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:15,965
Scott: If you finish all your routes, you can draw new ones, which means you're probably going to win.

562
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:22,870
Scott: Or you can, I guess that's a special option in the Europe one, because I'm looking at the Europe rules, the train stations.

563
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,490
Scott: Is that an option in the other one?

564
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:25,530
Rym: I don't remember.

565
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,530
Scott: I don't remember either.

566
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,250
Scott: Well, we'll talk about the train stations later.

567
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,109
Rym: We'll see how much of an impression this game made on us.

568
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,790
Scott: The train stations are not that important.

569
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,009
Rym: Yes, they are.

570
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:33,929
Rym: But anyway.

571
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:34,889
Scott: Well, they are, I guess.

572
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,710
Scott: But anyway, when you draw train cards, this is the good mechanic number ones.

573
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,410
Scott: He's a game of good mechanics that don't come together to create the greatest game.

574
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:43,826
Scott: It's a good game.

575
00:30:44,194 --> 00:30:44,750
Rym: It's a fun game.

576
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:45,908
Rym: It's a good like gateway game.

577
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:46,488
Scott: All right.

578
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,109
Scott: Anyway, drawing cards.

579
00:30:48,552 --> 00:30:50,810
Scott: There are a bunch of different colors of train card, right?

580
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:57,389
Scott: And let's say this green train is a green track connecting New York and Rochester.

581
00:30:57,993 --> 00:30:59,650
Scott: I don't even know if Rochester is on the map, right?

582
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:06,849
Scott: If there's green trains making that connection, then you need green cards to be able to build there or wild cards.

583
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:07,230
Scott: Right.

584
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,750
Scott: So you look in his five face up cards and one face down deck.

585
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:18,610
Scott: So you can either draw two face up ones or two face down or a face up and a face down.

586
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,030
Scott: Right.

587
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:27,824
Scott: And the thing is, if there's a wild card face up, if you take that, you can't take anything else.

588
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:28,869
Scott: So you can only take one.

589
00:31:29,058 --> 00:31:29,206
Rym: Yep.

590
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,390
Rym: Now, also, when you build a route with your little trains, you put the trains down pretty much like you see a route.

591
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:35,949
Rym: It's blue and it's got three spaces.

592
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:39,130
Rym: You got to play three blue cards or two blue in a wild.

593
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:39,646
Scott: Yeah.

594
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,444
Scott: Or three wilds.

595
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:40,900
Rym: Yeah.

596
00:31:42,177 --> 00:31:43,509
Rym: Or a wild into blue.

597
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:52,270
Scott: So you just you really try to get the, you know, the color that you need to make the connection you need to or the most urgent connection you need on your route.

598
00:31:52,350 --> 00:32:01,525
Scott: So, you know, if I have this big long route planned out and most of it, nobody's anywhere near, but there's a lot of action going on in Chicago and I need a specific route that's going to take four reds.

599
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,089
Scott: I'm going to be drawn lots of reds whenever I can.

600
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:04,503
Scott: Yeah.

601
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:09,410
Rym: Now, you also get kind of increasing returns that the more trains you use, the more segments in each route.

602
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,748
Rym: When you make a segment, you also get points for it.

603
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:12,366
Scott: Yep.

604
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:18,509
Rym: And like you get one point for a one segment, two for a two, six for a three.

605
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:21,830
Rym: Or I may I don't know if that it's a scribble.

606
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,670
Rym: I'm looking at an image.

607
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:25,890
Rym: It's like depending, you know, there's ten for a five and fifteen for a six.

608
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,086
Rym: Yeah.

609
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:34,729
Scott: Since the map is such a big web of all these different routes, you can get from point A to point B like going three or four different ways.

610
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:44,110
Scott: So you you the game sort of encourages you to go the ways where there are longer stretches of track between dots and you'll get more points that way.

611
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:51,130
Scott: But then again, it'll be slower and you'll have a better chance of failing because in the places where there are shorter tracks, there's a lot more dots.

612
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,989
Scott: There's a lot more alternate routes if someone comes in and screws you.

613
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:02,710
Rym: Now, we we could talk about strategy or like how to be good at this game or whatever, but I mean, we did that with settlers.

614
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,169
Rym: It was pretty easy with this game.

615
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,256
Rym: It's kind of much.

616
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,390
Rym: just do the most logical thing.

617
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,690
Rym: There's very little strategy to think about, really.

618
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:17,989
Scott: But the thing about this game that makes it great, especially for getting new people into more quality games, is this right on your turn.

619
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:19,870
Scott: You only you can't like draw.

620
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,390
Scott: It's not like, you know, you look at other games, right?

621
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,809
Scott: And they say, what do you do on your turn?

622
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:26,090
Scott: Well, in the first phase of your turn, you do this.

623
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,348
Scott: And on the second phase, you do that.

624
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:28,470
Scott: This game doesn't have that.

625
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:32,830
Scott: This game has on your turn, you either draw cards or claim a route.

626
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,029
Scott: That's most of what you're going to be doing most of the time.

627
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:35,368
Rym: Yep.

628
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,250
Rym: And the options you have when doing that are also very limited.

629
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,568
Rym: I mean, there's not that much on the board.

630
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,548
Rym: There aren't that many colors.

631
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:47,472
Rym: Not like, say, El Grande, where I can get any number between one and like 16.

632
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:50,390
Rym: And each number has different values and different things.

633
00:33:51,251 --> 00:33:56,549
Scott: And on your turn, you're pretty much either drawing cards or spending cards to put trains on the board, one or the other.

634
00:33:57,174 --> 00:33:59,250
Scott: And it's very quick.

635
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,010
Scott: You're doing a very small action.

636
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,750
Scott: So you go around and everyone on their turn does a very small action.

637
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,070
Scott: Small action, right?

638
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,710
Scott: So you go around and I do something quick.

639
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,290
Scott: The person left of me does something quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

640
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,610
Scott: Everyone does lots and lots of little things.

641
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:15,290
Scott: And this keeps the game moving.

642
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:16,750
Scott: You're constantly doing things.

643
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,270
Scott: You're not spending a lot of time waiting for people to take their turns.

644
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,949
Scott: Your turn doesn't have a whole lot to think about.

645
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:29,429
Scott: You're thinking more as a collection of turns, but you're still constantly working your way towards that big thing.

646
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,230
Scott: And then the thing about that is everyone's constantly playing.

647
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,310
Scott: You're never out of the game.

648
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,270
Scott: You're not really bored.

649
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:36,610
Scott: The game keeps you engaged.

650
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:40,050
Rym: And you don't need to worry about novice players needing to bevagon their ass.

651
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:50,570
Scott: You don't have to think too hard at any particular juncture, you know, and it keeps the game at a good pace and it makes it a lot of fun for people who aren't super gamers.

652
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:56,668
Rym: But if you're a hardcore gamer, still buy this game because it's a great game to get people into board gaming.

653
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:00,069
Rym: And like other games we have that aren't the super best games, it's fun.

654
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,850
Rym: I mean, Carcassonne is solved.

655
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,090
Rym: Settlers is solved, but they can still be fun to play depending on the situation.

656
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:08,830
Scott: And it can also handle a lot of players, like up to like five players.

657
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,330
Scott: It's not bad for more than some other games.

658
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,610
Rym: It's also a pretty quick play.

659
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,149
Rym: It's something you can just whip out and play now.

660
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,710
Scott: It's also really colorful and happy.

661
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,670
Rym: We didn't own the game.

662
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,308
Rym: Our friends James and Lisa had it, so they brought it and we played it with them and we never bought it.

663
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,369
Scott: But we liked it the times we played it.

664
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:24,541
Scott: Yeah.

665
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,130
Rym: So as a result, I was in the store, a Millennium in Rochester, and I saw Europe Edition.

666
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,290
Rym: I thought, all right, well, I already played the normal one.

667
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,790
Rym: I might as well just buy this edition and own that one instead.

668
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,770
Rym: It can't be that different.

669
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:39,450
Scott: Well, the Europe version adds two things that are kind of crappy.

670
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,730
Rym: Randomness and more randomness.

671
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:53,308
Rym: If you, sir, were tired of playing games where skill determines the victor, if you were bad at games and were frustrated at the fact that you lost due to your own lack of ability, have no fear.

672
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,530
Rym: Ticket to Ride Europe is your game.

673
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:57,250
Scott: So it has these tunnels, right?

674
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,601
Scott: And the way the tunnels work is.

675
00:35:58,621 --> 00:35:59,690
Scott: it's just a normal route.

676
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:00,128
Scott: Right.

677
00:36:00,651 --> 00:36:03,550
Scott: But if you want to build on the route, you like roll a dice.

678
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,009
Scott: You roll one die, I think.

679
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:05,690
Scott: Right.

680
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:06,170
Scott: Is that right?

681
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:15,070
Rym: No, it's pretty much you play out, like say you play out whatever many cards it is of the right color, and then you draw three more colors.

682
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:15,442
Rym: Oh, right.

683
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,989
Rym: And if you it's like you have you gamble and you can bet on the odds of finishing the tunnel or not.

684
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,310
Rym: If you finish it, great.

685
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,269
Rym: If you don't, well, you just wasted a turn.

686
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:25,850
Scott: Yeah.

687
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,710
Scott: It's like basically let's say a tunnel is three trains long.

688
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,010
Scott: Right.

689
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:32,170
Scott: So I try to build it and I have the three trains.

690
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:36,070
Scott: Then we do this random thing and it might turn out that I need to.

691
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,149
Rym: I'll read the actual rules.

692
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:37,403
Scott: OK.

693
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:42,768
Rym: When attempting to claim a tunnel route, a player first lays down the number of cards required by the route's length.

694
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:43,812
Rym: Then turn.

695
00:36:43,832 --> 00:36:49,210
Rym: the top three cards from the train deck for each card reveal that matches the color used to claim the route.

696
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,010
Rym: An additional card of the same color must be played to successfully claim the route.

697
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:58,489
Rym: If a player does not have enough cards, he takes all his cards back and the turn ends.

698
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:05,269
Scott: Depending on luck, you might lose a turn, but you could sort of mitigate that by having extra cards in your hand.

699
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:13,328
Scott: But then you might have to spend five cards to build a route that's only three long just to avoid losing a turn.

700
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:22,588
Scott: So it's basically, you know, you can build this route, but you might get randomly fucked and it doesn't really add a lot to the game, but just sort of makes it annoying if you need one of those routes.

701
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:30,814
Scott: The other thing the game as the ferries, which basically you need to have wild cards or some number of them to do.

702
00:37:30,854 --> 00:37:37,530
Scott: some of the ferry routes like this is one ferry route that goes from Smyrna to Palermo and it's six spaces long.

703
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:42,670
Scott: And you could use any four cards you want that are the same color, but even wild cards.

704
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,430
Scott: But you need two wild cards through those last two spots or else you can't do it.

705
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,018
Rym: Now, we haven't played any of the other.

706
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,110
Rym: well, the other expansion is the Marklin.

707
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,310
Scott: It's they're not expansions.

708
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,850
Scott: They're alternate versions of the game.

709
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,049
Scott: You could buy Europe on its own.

710
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,068
Scott: Marklin on its own.

711
00:37:55,555 --> 00:37:56,450
Scott: It's not an expansion.

712
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,670
Scott: You don't need to own regular tickets to ride to get tickets to ride Europe.

713
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,870
Scott: They're separate games entirely.

714
00:38:01,231 --> 00:38:09,610
Rym: But frankly, as far as I can see, the only thing you should buy is the original one is probably the best one, unless someone has played the third one and it's actually great.

715
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,649
Scott: People say that people say the Marklin one has like these passengers that you have to deliver.

716
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:17,170
Scott: And I don't remember what the mechanic is, but it could be good.

717
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:17,668
Scott: It could be bad.

718
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:18,127
Scott: I don't know.

719
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:18,969
Scott: I don't remember.

720
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,604
Rym: But the most important thing is that it's pronounced Sue St.

721
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:24,627
Rym: Marie, not salt.

722
00:38:27,671 --> 00:38:29,169
Scott: Also, green trains are the best.

723
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:30,090
Rym: I don't know.

724
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:32,490
Rym: Highly partial to the bright, searing blue.

725
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,425
Scott: Anyway, the yeah.

726
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:41,769
Scott: If you're the hardcore type of gamer person, you know, you this game, go back to playing El Grande in Puerto Rico.

727
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:43,489
Scott: You're not going to play this game too much.

728
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:55,330
Scott: But if you got a family, if you're trying to introduce people to maybe a world where there's, you know, cooler games in a world where games don't suck as much as Monopoly, you know, you can get someone to play tickets to ride.

729
00:38:55,551 --> 00:39:01,830
Rym: You know, it won't be that hard in a world where guess who isn't ruined by the fact that you're guys wearing glasses, right?

730
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,428
Scott: And then they'll probably like it.

731
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:14,130
Scott: And once you get them to play tickets to ride, you know, you'll be able to get them to play other games that look sort of similar that are much more complicated, like Puerto Rico or Settlers of Catan or Carcassonne or whatever.

732
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:16,370
Scott: So, yeah, take it to ride.

733
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:16,828
Scott: Not bad.

734
00:39:17,511 --> 00:39:26,590
Rym: And on that note, I got to finish preparing for Katsucon because we're doing a lot of stuff at this convention and we're leaving tomorrow, I guess Thursday morning tomorrow.

735
00:39:26,694 --> 00:39:26,969
Scott: Yes.

736
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:34,949
Rym: But I'm pretty much going to come home from work, look at my things that I'm going to be doing stuff with at the con, put them on a laptop and then go to bed.

737
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:35,966
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

738
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:41,168
Rym: And then the next day, me and Pete going to play some advanced wars for five hours while Scout drives.

739
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,329
Scott: Well, you know, what else are you going to be doing?

740
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,268
Rym: What are we going to be doing?

741
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,106
Scott: Buying gas.

742
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:46,129
Rym: That's fine.

743
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,528
Rym: Whatever.

744
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:48,309
Rym: It's not that far.

745
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,530
Rym: It's like an hour past Otakon.

746
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:50,369
Scott: Yeah, I know.

747
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,230
Scott: It's still, you can also pay for media at the Bob Evans.

748
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:54,989
Rym: Oh, that Bob Evans.

749
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,310
Rym: That Bob Evans saved my life and saved my life as well.

750
00:39:58,511 --> 00:39:59,590
Rym: But that's the story for another time.

751
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,929
Rym: Stay tuned tomorrow night.

752
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:08,670
Rym: The story of Bob Evans, where not only are we going to tomorrow night, talk about Katsucon and everything that's going on there, but we're going to review something important.

753
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,770
Rym: It's one of those, you know, anime world order.

754
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,970
Rym: They're a big anime podcast and then other podcasts that review things.

755
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:18,710
Rym: There's always those big ones, the big names that they you're almost afraid to review.

756
00:40:18,872 --> 00:40:20,530
Rym: Like, I don't think I could do it justice.

757
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,505
Rym: I got to wait.

758
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,805
Rym: You never actually do it.

759
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:32,789
Rym: Well, we're doing it, so we're not going to say what, but it should be pretty obvious that tomorrow night we're going to be reviewing the greatest animated television series ever created.

760
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,380
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

761
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,000
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

762
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:55,920
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com, where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our crapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

763
00:40:56,522 --> 00:41:02,139
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week, covering four different brands of geekery.

764
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,260
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

765
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,780
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

766
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,799
