Scott: go get a $14 haircut from the.

12
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:51,100
Scott: you know the generic barber or whatever.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,712
Rym: Man, you know what I haven't had a haircut since the last time I got.

14
00:00:54,773 --> 00:00:56,920
Rym: I got that like $80 haircut at Grand Central.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,552
Rym: All right, that was like a year and a half ago anyway.

16
00:00:59,572 --> 00:01:01,320
Scott: I go in and he's cutting my hair whatever.

17
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:08,520
Scott: It's not very hard to cut my hair And you know I noticed as he's you know combing and cutting and whatnot that my my scalp is being real nice.

18
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:09,608
Scott: You know it's got.

19
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:21,099
Scott: it's like something is scratching it But is you know also sort of massaging it, and it feels really good, and I look pet rat dude's got a metal comb Like I'm like whoa metal comb.

20
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:27,799
Scott: I never actually you know it's like huh like you would think that would be obvious right cuz plastic combs They're sort of like the hair beats.

21
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:32,420
Scott: It's like the plastic combs can't defeat the hair but a metal comb got a hair.

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,667
Rym: Do you have like?

23
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,599
Scott: a metal comb is just like hair out my way?

24
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:36,502
Scott: You know.

25
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,594
Scott: so just slide smooth no matter what your hair is up to.

26
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,060
Rym: I guess it depends on the metal.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,847
Rym: I mean wrought-iron not doing so well.

28
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:44,132
Scott: I guess I think it was like.

29
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:48,913
Scott: you know aluminum stainless steel something like that I guess cold iron aluminum if you were a demon.

30
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:53,640
Scott: I think it's probably aluminum, but Anyway, so I'm like wow metal comb.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,150
Scott: I've never seen a metal comb before, but it's so obvious, and he's like yeah I hate plastic comb, and you know this guy was from Russia.

32
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,635
Scott: He's like this comb.

33
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:03,140
Scott: I bring with me from Russia.

34
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:06,859
Scott: Oh, man, he's two more than X, and then he's got like a little.

35
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:14,048
Scott: you know Instead of having a thing of Barbasol right he actually had like this little like it looked like a microwave that Sterilized whatever was in it.

36
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:16,864
Scott: it might have been like a mini Clave thing.

37
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,009
Scott: you know autoclave.

38
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,800
Scott: I don't think it was an autoclave, but it was a tiny You know hairdresser sterilizing thing that was like a microwave.

39
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:33,404
Scott: He opens it up and inside he takes out this other comb, and he's like here This is also from same set, but I do not use this and it was like this pristine Different metal comb.

40
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:36,253
Rym: ooh, I wonder if he ever uses it.

41
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:37,416
Scott: He said he doesn't use it.

42
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:38,500
Rym: wonder what it's for.

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:38,921
Rym: I wonder.

44
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:41,030
Rym: maybe it combed the hair of someone important.

45
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,347
Scott: I don't know, but I'm gonna go on Amazon And I was looking.

46
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:45,620
Scott: I saw some metal combs there.

47
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,560
Scott: I'm gonna try to pick one up, but the shipping's too much.

48
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,624
Scott: So I'm gonna look in the store first.

49
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:50,552
Rym: huh is this gonna be a trend?

50
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:52,360
Rym: we had we went to our fancy shaving.

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,389
Rym: You're gonna go to fancy combing.

52
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:54,831
Scott: I'm gonna get.

53
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:55,373
Scott: it's just.

54
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:56,940
Scott: I'm not gonna do any fancy combing.

55
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,979
Scott: I'm just gonna get a metal comb because it Because it feels better on the on the scalp than a plastic one, that's pretty much it.

56
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:07,075
Rym: Well, I actually you know I've been saying pretty much all last winter.

57
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:10,533
Rym: I kept saying man I'm gonna buy blank, and I totally didn't.

58
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:14,113
Rym: and then this summer I was like I'm gonna buy blank while they're cheap, and I totally didn't.

59
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:16,283
Rym: and then last weekend I said this weekend.

60
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:17,948
Rym: I'm definitely going to buy blank.

61
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,459
Rym: I'm no matter what going to buy blank, and I didn't buy blank.

62
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,376
Scott: Why do I always play this game of keeping a secret?

63
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:24,959
Rym: I don't know it.

64
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:26,738
Rym: Should we stop?

65
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:29,940
Rym: No you do it - you can't just say our Rym always.

66
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,168
Scott: I don't do it so blatantly like that.

67
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:33,814
Scott: you gotta do it suddenly.

68
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:35,138
Scott: You can't just be like blank.

69
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,480
Scott: you gotta.

70
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:39,287
Scott: You know you gotta dodge around something.

71
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,814
Rym: you say finally bought blanks for my pistol.

72
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,378
Scott: great now.

73
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:57,853
Rym: I finally bought skis Because you see as I think I talked about this a lot when I went skiing last winter and almost broke my neck because Scott Johnson I can't say it was his fault, but basically we're standing at the top of.

74
00:03:58,094 --> 00:03:59,900
Rym: you know hadn't skied in a long time?

75
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:03,460
Rym: I wasn't that good at skiing when I was a kid, so we do the big bunny hill.

76
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,645
Rym: No, we didn't die all right.

77
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:05,730
Rym: We do the blue square.

78
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,574
Rym: Hey, we didn't die.

79
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:07,860
Rym: that was kind of easy all right.

80
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,104
Rym: Do the black diamond.

81
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:10,288
Rym: hey we didn't die.

82
00:04:10,308 --> 00:04:11,832
Rym: I guess we're invincible.

83
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:17,370
Rym: we did the double black diamond, and I almost died Uh-huh, so uh you know it was time.

84
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,694
Rym: I decided this saw this winter.

85
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:20,680
Rym: I'm gonna go to lessons.

86
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,894
Rym: I'm gonna ski like as many we get lessons.

87
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,840
Rym: Well, I got lessons when I was a kid and a lot of lessons.

88
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,990
Rym: That's how I learned how to ski.

89
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:34,860
Scott: because you see yeah But I mean if you can do every you know our lessons gonna help you go from you know hard to stupid hard.

90
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:38,012
Rym: Well, there are definitely some techniques in my.

91
00:04:38,032 --> 00:04:40,120
Rym: you know you can learn a lot about something in computers.

92
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,759
Rym: But then because you learned it on your own you're missing like one or two fundamental things.

93
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,130
Scott: You're getting by, but you're doing it wrong or like.

94
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,128
Rym: I'm doing most things right, but when I hit a mogul I just fucking die.

95
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,865
Rym: cuz I can't deal with them at all Cuz you're not using the technique.

96
00:04:57,885 --> 00:05:02,440
Scott: you just sort of doing it natural like with intuitions as opposed to doing it by the book.

97
00:05:02,643 --> 00:05:02,745
Scott: I'm

98
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:07,820
Rym: using the technique But you have to use a different technique with moguls like the way you got to turn differently on those things

99
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,542
Scott: Uh-huh, but

100
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:19,540
Rym: anyway the one thing I remember was that I was not that good at skiing like I couldn't do a black diamond The last time I skied and then this winter I was doing black diamonds just fine.

101
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:27,492
Rym: So I finally go to buy skis and you know I walk in and I'm not gonna pretend that I Know a lot about skis because they've changed a lot.

102
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:31,509
Rym: so I walk in to the ski house I find this guy, and I'm like look.

103
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,095
Rym: I haven't skied in like 10 years.

104
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:36,794
Rym: I skied last season I was doing really well for some reason.

105
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:37,860
Rym: and he stops me.

106
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,275
Rym: He says well you were using a shaped ski right and I was like you mean like those.

107
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:47,853
Rym: and I point and he's like yeah Pretty much all skis are like that now, and I said does that matter?

108
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:58,959
Rym: and he said well basically If you were skiing on one that wasn't shaped like that, and then you ski it on one that was shaped like that You're gonna be about ten times better because those skis are just absolutely better, and you're stupid to use an older ski

109
00:05:59,502 --> 00:05:59,784
Scott: Uh-huh,

110
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:06,479
Rym: and it's basically skiing as a sport has been made monumentally easier because of the advances of technology.

111
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:14,379
Scott: So usually like even a sport when the technology advances it like you know allows you to push the limit But it usually doesn't make it easier.

112
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:19,380
Scott: You know it's like fancy ice skates and fancy sticks don't make it any easier to be great at hockey.

113
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:24,700
Scott: But no, but if you're great at hockey they allow you to you know even go give me even greater and greater.

114
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:31,500
Scott: But if you suck at hockey doesn't matter what curve you got on the blade You're not gonna score any goals, but shape skis just make it so much easier.

115
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,680
Rym: He was like yeah in the old days like now if you want to turn you just turn and it just works.

116
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:46,073
Rym: So he pretty much said that was the reason I felt like I was so much better than I used to be and that it Wasn't me losing my bad habits or just innately having skill.

117
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:48,663
Rym: It was just far superior technology Mm-hmm.

118
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:50,069
Rym: so then you know I'm looking in.

119
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:52,921
Rym: the skis range from like 400 bucks to like $2,000.

120
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:54,648
Rym: so of course

121
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,799
Scott: I see the more expensive skis hurt or vastly so

122
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:11,659
Rym: I Look around for a bit, then I say all right What's the difference between this ski and I hold up this like $600 ski and this ski and it's $800 And he's like about 200 bucks and that one's blue.

123
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:14,209
Rym: Yeah, and I was like seriously.

124
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:14,571
Rym: He's like.

125
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:15,818
Rym: There's no difference.

126
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:19,392
Rym: look This one's like a tiny bit narrower, but that's not gonna matter.

127
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:20,335
Rym: They're shaped the same.

128
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:21,720
Rym: They're the same basic length.

129
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:23,604
Scott: Make any money.

130
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:26,916
Scott: He should have told he should have made up some bullshit about how the $200 one was $200 better.

131
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:35,778
Rym: I think part of the reason is that he could tell I don't know if he could tell that I wasn't gonna take any BS Or if he just because he seems like he actually skis a lot.

132
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:44,704
Scott: But see and that's the other thing right is if if you're let's say if there's nobody in the world who that blues ski would Have been better for Then why even stock it?

133
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:45,527
Rym: you want to know why.

134
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:47,573
Rym: one I think I realized what it is.

135
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:50,002
Rym: one if you are an expert skier Like.

136
00:07:50,023 --> 00:08:01,669
Rym: I pointed some other skis And he put he said like well that one has this special binding and it'll it'll prevent the ski from flattening out Completely when you're taking a car Which is kind of the way you turn on hard pack.

137
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:04,420
Rym: and I was like well that affect me at my skill level.

138
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:06,428
Rym: And he said I've been skiing for 20 years.

139
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:08,998
Rym: that doesn't affect me, and I said will it affect anyone?

140
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,379
Rym: he said yes There are people for whom this would be an advantage.

141
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:14,177
Rym: None of those people are in this store right now.

142
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:16,884
Rym: Okay, you know.

143
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:20,095
Rym: and finally I'm like all right what ski should I buy?

144
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:23,774
Rym: he's and he just grabs one And he says this one and I said what length.

145
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:25,605
Rym: and he looks at me And he looks over.

146
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:31,117
Rym: he grabs a one specific length and says this leg 169 All right, and I was like how much is this?

147
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:32,467
Rym: 260 bucks.

148
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:37,225
Rym: What I thought it was 600. now This is last year's key.

149
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:40,679
Rym: this year's keys are all 600. last year's keys are like 200 bucks because no one wants them.

150
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:42,480
Rym: What's the difference about?

151
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:47,009
Rym: So all right, I need ski boots.

152
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:47,812
Rym: I'm not gonna tell this.

153
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:49,600
Rym: so basically he did the same thing with ski boots.

154
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:51,447
Rym: I'm like what ski boots should I buy?

155
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:52,371
Rym: and he just says this one.

156
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:54,560
Rym: It's like why that's the one I use.

157
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:57,219
Rym: It also happens to be the second cheapest one in the store.

158
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:59,226
Rym: Should I buy the cheapest one?

159
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,130
Rym: No, it's terrible.

160
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,732
Rym: Yeah.

161
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:01,918
Scott: What does he even have them?

162
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:02,420
Scott: It's terrible.

163
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,466
Scott: I seem to have it in case people are poor.

164
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,134
Scott: if you're poor why he was going skiing?

165
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:08,920
Rym: you can actually ski for pretty cheap.

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,060
Rym: It's only really that expensive if you Buy your own equipment and don't use it all the time or you go to like fancy places far away to ski.

167
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,904
Scott: Yeah, but if you're poor rent Don't do it that often.

168
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:24,500
Rym: if you already own skis and there's a local little ski place skeins not that expensive.

169
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:28,748
Rym: Anyway, if any of you know skeins real cheap.

170
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:30,853
Scott: it on it on has the cheapest skiing.

171
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:39,338
Rym: if anyone out there wants to ski with Me I'm gonna be skiing a lot in the mid Hudson Valley this winter on my brand-new super cheap skis.

172
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,844
Rym: Oh, man It's all I got really.

173
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:43,631
Rym: so what do you got in the sciency techie news?

174
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:44,233
Scott: I got three.

175
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:45,298
Scott: quick news is here right?

176
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:45,820
Scott: number one?

177
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:53,660
Scott: I'm probably not gonna talk about this because they're not gonna announce anything exciting But tomorrow is Apple laptop announce II day, right?

178
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,510
Scott: The only things you should actually be concerned with.

179
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:04,380
Scott: right people are spreading rumors about this brick Thing where they're gonna make a laptop out of a solid piece of aluminum and sort of carve it out and screw that whatever.

180
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:07,587
Scott: Well, you should be concerned about is number one.

181
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:13,666
Scott: They're they're discussing making an $800 Apple laptop Which is not a bad idea.

182
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:26,800
Scott: And here's the reason that this is very likely is because I think This is what I heard right that somehow it was calculated that because you know Apple likes to sell Laptops at these incredibly huge margins.

183
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:32,725
Scott: So if you look at just the power of the hardware versus what you could get for the same amount in a PC It's like Apple's hardware.

184
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:37,440
Scott: the speeds and the amount of RAM is so weak, you know, cuz they just overcharge for everything.

185
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:40,672
Scott: But what's gonna do if they do an $800 laptop?

186
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,380
Scott: They're gonna do it on a low margin.

187
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,840
Scott: It's actually gonna be pretty comparable to a PC laptop, which is good in this bad economy.

188
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,860
Scott: But someone's like why would they do this after their years and years of you know, having these, you know, ridiculous margins and everything?

189
00:10:53,821 --> 00:11:07,840
Scott: Somebody said that by their calculations if Apple doesn't put out an $800 laptop That the stock would devalue so much that they would actually lose more money than they lose by decreasing the margins on this thing.

190
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:12,674
Rym: I have all my opinions about that, but I'm not allowed to talk about them.

191
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:21,859
Scott: You're right, but basically Apple laptops tomorrow and I was walking on the street to the Apple store together because there's a recall on the.

192
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,953
Scott: you know Power adapty things for the iPhone.

193
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:26,459
Scott: Oh, yeah, so I want to take care of that.

194
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:27,303
Scott: They make.

195
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:27,624
Scott: they make.

196
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:29,833
Scott: you give them like your iPhone serial number.

197
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:31,318
Scott: They don't just trade in for the.

198
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:32,776
Scott: you know The physical thing, huh?

199
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,420
Rym: Well, I got maybe if you had one of the new ones and then you dropped it or soaked in water or something And I don't know how many people break those things.

200
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,017
Scott: No, cuz the new ones have a green dot on them and the plugs are shaped differently a little bit.

201
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:43,459
Scott: Uh-huh.

202
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:53,719
Scott: But anyway, I saw a guy walking down the street away from the Apple store Or the MacBook and it was in one of those, you know, the boxes that looked like he just bought it.

203
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,543
Scott: Yeah, if he uses that as his case then alright, but if if he just bought a MacBook, I'd Does he not?

204
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:03,174
Scott: I mean in the Apple store, they're pretty well.

205
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:04,580
Scott: I didn't even see any MacBooks.

206
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,609
Scott: It was just all new iPods everywhere.

207
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:08,999
Scott: So I don't know what that guy was doing.

208
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:22,691
Scott: I guess maybe he could have had an emergency situation But I have a feeling that guy mistakenly bought a MacBook on the worst possible day, okay Second tiny news ready is real tiny.

209
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:25,720
Scott: There's a study warning of hearing laws from music players.

210
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:28,814
Rym: I was gonna talk about that because it's basically.

211
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:29,899
Rym: it's not BS.

212
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,529
Rym: I mean the news is true, but the answer is just where.

213
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,240
Rym: isolation earbuds and you won't have a problem, right?

214
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:41,180
Scott: We've talked about this a million times before but it needs to be repeated again for the sake of people's hearing which is very important.

215
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:48,650
Scott: Right, I hate how all these studies say you hearing losses from the portable music player It's not from the portable music player.

216
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,640
Scott: The portable music player is not to blame.

217
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:53,840
Scott: What is to blame is that you have these crappy earbuds?

218
00:12:54,021 --> 00:13:06,660
Scott: and if you have earbuds in and there are noises around you like you're walking on a city street or you're sitting at a Place where a lot of people are talking the the noise of the people talking the background noise also gets in your ear.

219
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:22,504
Scott: So you have to crank up the volume on your iPod or whatever in order to make your music or your podcast Louder than the noises around you and thus everyone who uses iPods and as these crappy headphones like the ones that come with the iPod Cranks it way up.

220
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:24,408
Scott: and by cranking the volume way up.

221
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:29,340
Scott: You're having more decibels per unit time constantly and that damages your hearing.

222
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:37,228
Scott: The solution is to a don't turn it up if you don't have you know Isolation earbuds or noise cancelling headphones.

223
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,475
Scott: It does a lot of background noise.

224
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:40,980
Scott: Just turn your iPod off.

225
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,951
Scott: don't listen in that situation because you're gonna hurt yourself and Get either a lot of money, but they're worth it.

226
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:50,700
Scott: get isolation earbuds or noise cancelling headphones.

227
00:13:50,760 --> 00:14:01,608
Scott: You put them in and they either use noise cancelling technology to cancel out noises Or they seal your ear so that other outside noises don't get in at all And all you can hear is the music.

228
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:08,917
Scott: and let me tell you when I was using normal iPod headphones I used to have to turn my iPod mini up to like 80% of the max volume to hear it.

229
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:19,550
Scott: now With my you know, ever since I started using etymotics like a couple years ago I can turn the thing down on my iPhone to like 25% and it's loud.

230
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:22,665
Rym: and you know, honestly while we're at it You really should own.

231
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:25,294
Rym: I say this because it's relevant since ed packs.

232
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:26,739
Rym: I saw that very few people had them.

233
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:38,120
Rym: but Buy a nice pair of earplugs like concert earplugs if you like to go to metal concerts Because if you're at a concert and you're not wearing earplugs, you're pretty much stupid.

234
00:14:38,622 --> 00:14:40,609
Scott: Yeah, I mean there are some situations.

235
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:59,710
Scott: we go to a concert you take your earplugs out for a little bit to rock out Pretty hard, but for you should not do that for an entire concert you will guaranteed Especially like a metal concert or something or any sort of rock pop concert even at like in a dance club If you don't have any earplugs in you are damaging your hearing And it's impossible to repair.

236
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,979
Scott: it will be damaging it permanently.

237
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:02,280
Rym: someday.

238
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:11,170
Scott: We'll have the bionic ears someday while the bionic ears until then if you want to hear and not have hearing aids when you're old Do what we say, okay, but also it's a crime.

239
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,000
Rym: I see people wearing those like foam ones.

240
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,613
Rym: They bought for like five bucks before the concert.

241
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:17,880
Rym: They just make it sound terrible.

242
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:18,303
Rym: They make.

243
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:20,920
Scott: did you make things sound terrible, but they're better than nothing?

244
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:28,592
Rym: Yeah, but it's so little more money to buy like professional Equal decibel reduction plugs.

245
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:30,140
Rym: We got a modic or some other company.

246
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,365
Scott: This is what people don't realize.

247
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:33,392
Scott: is that those foam things that you buy right?

248
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:35,340
Scott: because music is all about frequencies, right?

249
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:42,880
Scott: So if you want to make music quieter, you need to reduce the volume of all the frequencies, you know of audio equally.

250
00:15:43,382 --> 00:15:47,340
Scott: Those foam things reduce some frequencies more than others.

251
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:56,120
Scott: So maybe you won't hear the bass as much or maybe you won't hear the trebles as much, you know If you go and buy I think we what are they called the eddie 15s that we have?

252
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:58,329
Rym: Yeah, because they've reduced it by 15 decibels.

253
00:15:58,429 --> 00:15:59,313
Scott: eddie 15s.

254
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:01,100
Scott: or you know, you can get any other earplugs.

255
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,268
Scott: It's just the ones we buy.

256
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:14,320
Scott: because we're animatic fanboys I guess I don't know but because they're like 10 bucks because they're they're like 10 15 bucks and you put these in and it Reduces every frequency of audio by exactly 15 decibels.

257
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:20,540
Scott: So the music sounds exactly the same just quieter and a live concert was better than that, right?

258
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:24,340
Scott: So you should just carry them with you anywhere, especially if concerts are gonna happen.

259
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:35,379
Scott: Okay and my final tiny news is that open office 3.0 came out today ish and their website is totally ruined and basically all they have is a download page up and everything else is down.

260
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:44,446
Scott: but They added some new features like compatibility with the new, you know, Microsoft office formats and Some other BS like that.

261
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:49,000
Scott: and people are discussing, you know, is this really enough to call it 3.0?

262
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,360
Scott: Is it really that different from the previous one?

263
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,620
Scott: Apparently you can open PDFs in it and possibly edit them and you know open office has long had the feature to export to PDF.

264
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,540
Scott: So that's that's a good enough reason to upgrade right there.

265
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:09,189
Scott: But you know really open office is sort of big and slow and people only really use at least, you know It has like drawing and all these other at.

266
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:09,892
Scott: you know, it's a suite.

267
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:10,635
Scott: It's an office suite.

268
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:11,599
Scott: has all the different parts.

269
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:18,220
Scott: I've never seen anyone use any part except for the word processing the spreadsheet and the you know presentation.

270
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:32,216
Scott: I've never seen anyone else use any of the other parts of open office So I don't even know why they keep making them or anything, but really in my opinion, you know You either got Microsoft office for free or your company paid for it or something.

271
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:33,120
Scott: or you know, that's fine.

272
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:46,316
Scott: but if not just use you know a word processor and a spreadsheet like I use a B word and numeric and For I use Google Docs, you know, what do I need this big clunky office suite for?

273
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,240
Scott: that is a million features?

274
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,123
Scott: I'm never gonna use.

275
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:54,144
Rym: honestly, I have open office installed and part of the reason is that what I often open word doc I have it installed.

276
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:54,486
Scott: Yeah.

277
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:56,454
Rym: Yeah, but I use it for like.

278
00:17:56,474 --> 00:18:01,860
Rym: if I make a Google presentation, I Export it to PowerPoint and then I open it in open office.

279
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:03,024
Scott: Yeah, you know I'll do.

280
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:06,496
Scott: I'll use it for you know, sort of like these off situations.

281
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:13,740
Scott: I won't use it like regularly I won't go to it, but sometimes I'll have it there just in case there's like a you know, like what's it called?

282
00:18:14,263 --> 00:18:17,140
Rym: Well, I'll also use it to one of those outlying situations.

283
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,936
Rym: I'll use it to make presentations because if I'm not on the internet then Google gears is basically useless.

284
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:23,658
Scott: That's true.

285
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:24,079
Scott: It's true.

286
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:34,949
Scott: But yeah, if you're uh, you know If you need an office thing or maybe you're using open office already You need to upgrade it or you know You're interested in trying to open up PDFs and edit them.

287
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,147
Scott: maybe make it a character sheet for a game or something like that You know and you go for it.

288
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,100
Rym: So I got to talk about this.

289
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:57,856
Rym: I'm not going to talk about it at length because Eventually, we'll either have to do a show on it or I'll have to write some sort of angry thesis about it, but well in this case is good news Thomas, which is the kind of Legislative information part of the Library of Congress and yes, it's named after Thomas Jefferson.

290
00:18:58,198 --> 00:19:03,800
Rym: Oh, yeah One of my favorite presidents even though his Navy not such a good idea.

291
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,326
Scott: Well, that's the thing is like every.

292
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:12,315
Scott: it seems like every president throughout history had like greatness But also terribleness and I think that is the mark of a great president.

293
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,043
Scott: greatness and terrible Is he'd both.

294
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,598
Rym: what bad did William Henry Harrison do?

295
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:19,348
Scott: Harrison do so.

296
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:20,153
Rym: we balanced out.

297
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:21,080
Rym: that's better than we can hope.

298
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:27,999
Scott: No, you need to have a greatness and a terribleness at the same time greatness more people remember his name than many other presidents.

299
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:31,729
Scott: No, you have to.

300
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:33,698
Scott: you have to achieve greatness in your life.

301
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:37,128
Rym: Taft achieved great corpulence.

302
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,976
Scott: now is to keep Taft as an example of bad president.

303
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:40,839
Scott: only terribleness.

304
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:44,354
Rym: No greatness I think Grant drank more alcohol than all the rest of them combined.

305
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:45,620
Scott: again only terribleness.

306
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:48,511
Scott: Right Lincoln had greatness and terribleness.

307
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:49,736
Scott: win civil war.

308
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:50,760
Scott: be an asshole.

309
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,793
Scott: You see the greatness and the terribleness.

310
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:57,273
Scott: Andrew Jackson Be have huge huge balls and do what you want.

311
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:57,935
Scott: That's greatness.

312
00:19:58,176 --> 00:20:01,007
Scott: do a bad thing though Because what he wanted was bad terribleness.

313
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:02,914
Scott: James Madison's eyes on the $20.

314
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:03,998
Scott: James Madison's.

315
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:07,313
Rym: my man Even though I'll bet a lot of you listening can't name anything.

316
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:07,714
Rym: He did.

317
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:08,940
Scott: I can't name anything.

318
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:16,860
Rym: Anyway, I'm not gonna belabor the point because it's all quick news here, but Thomas publishes permanent.

319
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,747
Rym: I just wanted to do that alliteration their links.

320
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:25,683
Rym: Basically the news is that there is now an official permanent way to link to Legislation.

321
00:20:25,803 --> 00:20:33,116
Rym: so if you want to reference in for bibliographies, yes It's basically a way to have a permanent link to legislation.

322
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:37,460
Rym: that is itself enshrined in the protocols of the Library of Congress.

323
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,118
Scott: So you could then send one of those links to the Library of Congress and they can send you to law.

324
00:20:42,043 --> 00:20:44,634
Rym: Or well, you can just click on that link and see the law.

325
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:45,698
Scott: That's good, too.

326
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:53,104
Rym: Basically, I'm gonna actually read from the slash shot here with prompting from the Sunlight Foundation's open house project Which is a very good thing.

327
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:59,788
Rym: By the way, the US Library of Congress has announced today that it's online database Thomas will now generate persistent URLs.

328
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:03,700
Rym: They're gonna call these legislative handles for legislative documents.

329
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:07,959
Rym: Quote, it is certainly nice to be able to link to legislation with a persistent link.

330
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:12,300
Scott: Can I link to like different like, you know, maybe I'll link to say the DMCA, right?

331
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,186
Scott: Can I link to like?

332
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,020
Scott: I don't know how the laws are arranged.

333
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,599
Scott: I'm not a lawyer like clause 33 of the DMCA, you know get to the middle of it and such like that.

334
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:25,393
Scott: Honestly, I have no idea because Hey lawyers figure this out for us.

335
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:28,710
Rym: basically though I think it's a step in the right direction because I'll

336
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,212
Scott: definitely

337
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:36,485
Rym: I'm of the mind that one every single law in the United States from the federal to the state to the International to the local

338
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:38,854
Scott: to the to the small podunk ordinance

339
00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:45,514
Rym: needs to be online Not just online and free to everyone online for anyone to link to look at copy whatever.

340
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:57,640
Rym: it should also be available in Every library in your locale at least your local laws and basically needs to be available at zero cost to anyone any citizen Who has no anyone in the world who asks?

341
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:02,020
Scott: Mmm, that is my feeling and that is and needs to be in the public domain.

342
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:07,009
Scott: Yeah, so you could take it and do shit with it and you know include it, you know I thought just so.

343
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,898
Scott: I can link to it But I need to be able to like take it edit it and put up a new document on my site and then etc.

344
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:21,760
Rym: At least luckily all those instances of Copyrighted law in the US are very slowly being overturned by a small number of very vocal activists.

345
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:30,280
Rym: but I feel like in the end the law needs to be codified entirely in digital form and Sadly while a lot I would say that's a great step forward.

346
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:34,680
Rym: That's maybe one tenth of a percent of what I actually want to happen with law.

347
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:47,880
Rym: But this is such a step in the right direction that I encourage all of you to go here follow this link Read about this and get involved in all these initiatives because I don't think very many people in the u.s Let alone do they know the law?

348
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,200
Rym: They don't even have access to the law or don't know they have access to the law.

349
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:52,165
Rym: It's very different.

350
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:54,095
Scott: even if they did have access and they tried to read it.

351
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:54,919
Scott: They wouldn't understand it.

352
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,820
Rym: It's very difficult for non lawyers to understand or even get access to the law.

353
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,820
Rym: I mean, I have browsed the law library in my building at work.

354
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:11,628
Rym: you know my building has a law library for all of us to access and I have may I've made heads and Almost a tale of exactly one thing.

355
00:23:11,748 --> 00:23:13,673
Rym: I read there once it's just.

356
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:16,460
Scott: uh, so I can sometimes understand a clause or two.

357
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:38,025
Scott: But I think if you actually if they had every law online like that then people who were lawyers You know who either were being paid as part of or volunteering or something like that could go through and sort of translate laws You know sort of into Colloquial speak for people to understand and then link to the original and so like a second database of you know Understandable to the layman

358
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:39,672
Rym: law if you want my kind of

359
00:23:39,692 --> 00:23:41,780
Scott: binding obviously in court or anything.

360
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:47,280
Scott: But it would just be for people to look up, you know And to help themselves without having to pay a lawyer for basic things.

361
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,027
Rym: What I really want is that from there.

362
00:23:49,107 --> 00:24:07,039
Rym: I feel like all laws should be hyperlinks Maybe not using the hyperlink transfer protocol, but something where all all kind of hypertext transfer protocol Yes but any term in a law that's a legal term should always have a link to a Kind of legal definition of that term.

363
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:14,279
Scott: Well, usually when I've looked at some laws and what they'll do is the top of a law will define like the the magic terms It's gonna use in itself.

364
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:17,388
Scott: but you know even that is when you're reading law.

365
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:24,920
Scott: anytime the term appears you'd be able to click on it and it'll take you to the Top or pop open that little definition from the top in a window or something, you know, something like that.

366
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,980
Rym: But my long-term like 50-year out ideas that we should have all law should be written in some kind of markup language.

367
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:37,660
Rym: I always say XML, but you need some sort of special markup language for laws such that say on a federal level, right?

368
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,620
Scott: I think raw law sort of is written in a language, but it's a legal language.

369
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:45,273
Rym: Yes, it needs to be a language that is much more understandable to computers.

370
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,280
Scott: So we need law ML basic something like that.

371
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:54,920
Rym: I mean imagine this Ml possession, you know the idea of possession is defined in all different states and all different towns in different ways.

372
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:07,856
Rym: But the basic idea of possession should be defined Universally I think across the entire country and then anytime possession is referenced in a law that state is already defined by this top thing.

373
00:25:08,377 --> 00:25:27,338
Rym: and then you only supersede that kind of like inheritance if you're writing object-oriented code if you need a very specific altered definition For your specific law and most laws shouldn't need that and maybe you define possession of and then there's different possessions depending on what you are defining possession of.

374
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:34,400
Rym: and If we spent 20 or 30 years sorting all this out I think we could solve the majority of the legal problems we have in the u.s.

375
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:34,741
Rym: Today.

376
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,848
Scott: it'll take a lot less time to figure stuff out.

377
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:37,370
Scott: at least.

378
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:40,973
Scott: the problem is how many errors would be in there after people Are typing all this shit in.

379
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:44,435
Rym: yeah Yeah, but this is one of my kind of long-term pipe dreams.

380
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:47,392
Rym: that just probably good We're gonna have to wait until AI is around.

381
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:48,599
Rym: that'll just do it for us.

382
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:54,255
Scott: Yeah They'll be the AI judge of the world and then it'll kill us all as long as it doesn't turn into judge.

383
00:25:54,295 --> 00:26:06,025
Rym: dread rims guilty Things of the day.

384
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:09,979
Rym: so I would say you've all but I know a lot of you were just.

385
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,399
Scott: you know You're gonna say y'all instead.

386
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:23,879
Rym: You know when I lived down south for a short for not a short time But a month or so while I was at space camp and traveling I got real close to saying y'all a couple times All right It went away.

387
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:36,554
Rym: But so all of you are probably either already already already had this experience or someday will the experience of having an RA This video on CollegeHumor a

388
00:26:36,635 --> 00:26:37,520
Scott: resident advisor

389
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:51,700
Rym: Yeah, and then there you know, there's other terms but basically it's that dude in college who is kind of the leader of your floor in your dorm and Your goal is to have as little interaction with this person as possible, but that will often be unavoidable.

390
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:58,615
Scott: But well, it depends, you know and what you're exact, you know The the social nature of your floor is like at how much interaction you'll want to have.

391
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:03,040
Scott: but generally, you know Well, you don't want them to come bothering you unless you're friends with them.

392
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,680
Rym: I skipped every single floor meeting on my because it was pointless and they couldn't do anything to me.

393
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,128
Scott: But they barely had any floor meetings.

394
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:13,879
Rym: as our RA was the best RA in the universe We had floor meetings kind of often because of what went on in Fish B.

395
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,463
Scott: That's right.

396
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:16,849
Scott: You lived in Fish B. Yes.

397
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:24,520
Rym: I lived in the infamous fucking Fish B. Well, I wouldn't say the worst place to live because that would be over in some of those other dorms.

398
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,099
Rym: But I won't name but Fish B was special.

399
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,451
Rym: But RAs are a certain breed of person.

400
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:41,790
Rym: they are either the rare Incredibly awesome RA and those are is are all kind of the same or they're like mine or they're the normal RA the eponymous RA the the RA that you expect.

401
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,159
Rym: and that RA is what you see in this video.

402
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:46,328
Scott: Yeah that in his video.

403
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:48,095
Scott: It's the stereotypical RA.

404
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:59,780
Rym: and let me tell you most RAs I met were exactly like that to the point that if I if like if I if this video had been older I would almost guess that they were affecting the behavior of this video in their RA-ness.

405
00:27:59,863 --> 00:28:01,646
Rym: But no RAs are really like.

406
00:28:01,706 --> 00:28:03,353
Scott: I think it's that type of person who was like.

407
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:06,026
Scott: that is the type of person that sign ups to be Signs up to be an RA.

408
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:12,139
Rym: only two kinds of people sign up to be RAs People who have no money and need free dorms or people who are like this.

409
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:16,260
Rym: Yep, and the people who have no money are the ones who end up being the awesome RAs.

410
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:19,860
Scott: Yep, because they don't they either don't give a shit or they're awesome.

411
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:25,408
Rym: But anyway, well watch this video because next Thursday's show I think we're gonna do a show about college dorms.

412
00:28:25,548 --> 00:28:26,310
Rym: I was inspired.

413
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,800
Scott: Alright, so, you know, there's a lot of rich people out there.

414
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:35,600
Scott: Well, not that many but people always make fun of rich people for spending their money on stupid shit.

415
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,515
Scott: They'd be like, oh you bought your golden toilet seat.

416
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:43,232
Scott: Oh You bought your a hundred Porsches, you know, what the fuck's wrong?

417
00:28:43,312 --> 00:28:43,633
Scott: is this?

418
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:44,998
Rym: a collection of stupid crap?

419
00:28:45,078 --> 00:28:45,720
Rym: rich people bought?

420
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:47,566
Scott: No, not at all.

421
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:49,774
Scott: There's one rich man.

422
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,460
Scott: His name is Jay Walker.

423
00:28:51,881 --> 00:28:54,209
Scott: He's the guy who made a bunch of money from priceline.com.

424
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:54,972
Rym: Johnny Walker.

425
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:55,915
Scott: No, Jay Walker.

426
00:28:55,955 --> 00:28:56,598
Scott: Jay Walker.

427
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,985
Scott: Yes Okay, his name is Jay Walker.

428
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:00,088
Scott: How you like that?

429
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,134
Rym: JAY or J period.

430
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:02,515
Scott: JAY.

431
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:05,483
Scott: All right, but He's rich.

432
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:05,744
Scott: He was.

478
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:49,576
Rym: I can dig this because I feel like I would.

479
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:55,560
Rym: if I were that rich I would probably own a similar if not quite as ludicrous collection of things.

480
00:31:55,801 --> 00:32:03,854
Scott: No, but you really like what I you know, I don't think I've correctly Communicated the amazingness of this but when you see it you go.

481
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:07,380
Scott: Oh That guy has spent his money wisely.

482
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:12,028
Rym: Was the famous Lewis black?

483
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:13,434
Rym: what'd you buy another car?

484
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:14,780
Scott: Yeah something like that.

485
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,860
Scott: Yeah, look at you Bill Gates and Jerry Seinfeld, you know, this this is a lot better than a personal ball washer.

486
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:28,660
Rym: Let me tell you so well, it depends Is it a personal ball washer that washes golf balls or something far more sinister just when you see this library Rym?

487
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,702
Scott: I think you'd be like oh Oh.

488
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,886
Rym: So, uh, what were we talking about?

489
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:45,425
Rym: since we tend to record, you know little-known fact we record the arm Rym And I'm Scott and this is GeekNights After we record the show Didn't we?

490
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:52,313
Scott: I guess he decided to go at the crab people idea of just Talking about really old computers at least old personal computers.

491
00:32:52,394 --> 00:32:54,180
Rym: Yeah, I guess luckily we went kind of long in the front.

492
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,024
Rym: That was intentional.

493
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:56,994
Scott: Yeah, I mean, let's I'll just start.

494
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:58,340
Scott: when I was in kindergarten, right?

495
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,206
Scott: Was the first time I ever actually used a computer.

496
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:12,225
Scott: they had Apple - and in elementary school every classroom had Apple - but there was some Mac 512 and the library eventually got a really fancy Mac that had a CD-ROM but that was.

497
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:13,691
Scott: that was my experience.

498
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:20,578
Scott: most of my experience with old computers was you know, Old Macs in elementary school and you know doing logo on the Apple - and all that business.

499
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:34,853
Scott: Wow Honestly the first computer I owned as I've said before Was a 486 SX - no the first computer I owned was a 486 dx4 But before that I was you know, using lots of computers in school and in summer camp.

500
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:38,861
Rym: the first computer I used was a 386.

501
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:42,535
Scott: Wow, so fifth grade so I was using computers four years before you.

502
00:33:42,635 --> 00:33:47,460
Rym: that explains a lot I don't know because the thing is I had a good computer.

503
00:33:47,500 --> 00:34:01,720
Rym: I got the 486 SX - right when it came out - the x4 100 megahertz With 8 megs of RAM, but then a quad That penny and pro which basically gave me the biggest dong in the world for a long time.

504
00:34:02,221 --> 00:34:03,325
Scott: Yeah for a while, but we're not.

505
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:05,251
Scott: we're talking about computers older than those.

506
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:11,159
Scott: 486 is talking about Mac 512 K's Mac pluses IBM xt's.

507
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:25,170
Rym: Honestly, the first time I ever typed a document on a computer Was in fifth grade When I typed an essay that basically it was funny because you know We wrote a some dumb essay about this book called my side of the mountain.

508
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:26,536
Rym: I read my snow.

509
00:34:26,757 --> 00:34:28,926
Rym: No, it wasn't that I. I take that back.

510
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:30,150
Rym: I like my side of the mountain.

511
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:32,040
Rym: The essay was about bare stone.

512
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:33,206
Scott: I don't know what that is.

513
00:34:33,226 --> 00:34:33,911
Scott: It's about.

514
00:34:34,514 --> 00:34:38,945
Scott: it's about a bare stone anyway Stone that looks like a bear.

515
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:41,960
Scott: basically in fifth grade a bear was at the stone where a bear lives.

516
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:54,199
Rym: They did they decided after we wrote this essay that they took the five smart kids in the class and said You get to go to the computer lab, which is kind of new and type your essay on the computer.

517
00:34:56,721 --> 00:35:02,100
Rym: So I went there and I typed my essay on the computer kind of slowly because I I typed at a mediocre pace.

518
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,620
Scott: I didn't learn how to type until 10th grade.

519
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:10,920
Rym: You know when I learned how to type really when I got ICQ and you know, you know, what's ironic, right?

520
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:14,960
Scott: All those years have been using Apple twos max better max, right?

521
00:35:16,221 --> 00:35:18,379
Scott: Had the 486 even still didn't know how to type.

522
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:22,284
Scott: Tenth grade went to learn how to talk about it And you know what?

523
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:25,900
Scott: I took the keyboard in class at high school with this incredibly old teacher.

524
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:38,564
Scott: She must have been like 80 something and it was like her last year there she retired pretty much right after she taught me how to type and The one lab that she used to teach people how to type the rest of the school had like Pentium 75 Pentium 200s, right

525
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:39,586
Rym: the lab

526
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:42,935
Scott: where you learned how to type had IBM XTs.

527
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:46,467
Rym: Oh man the parochial school I went to had IBM XTs.

528
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:49,179
Rym: I used them a little bit, but I didn't really use them.

529
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:52,799
Scott: I only used them to learn how to type and to play typing games.

530
00:35:53,701 --> 00:36:14,907
Rym: See, it's weird that I use computers a lot like in fifth and sixth grade like as soon as I got access to computers I immediately started like rebooting to DOS and running Q basic and like typing stuff and like writing programs and figuring stuff out, but I really couldn't type honestly Until I got instant messaging Yeah and pretty much as soon as I got ICQ.

531
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:22,780
Rym: and I got ICQ like as soon as ICQ was available and I was using it like betas and I typed to people all the time.

532
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:25,895
Rym: And that was how I learned how to type because I refused like.

533
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:26,819
Rym: it wasn't even like.

534
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:27,663
Rym: well It wasn't like.

535
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:30,212
Rym: I don't want to be like these other people who can't type.

536
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:46,819
Rym: I get online and everyone Typed in complete sentences with periods partly because the mechanism design of ICQ encouraged that sort of typing as opposed to AOL which encouraged OMGBBQBBL AFK MOF or MOS.

537
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:49,106
Scott: Yeah, kind of.

538
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:51,154
Scott: I think it also had to do with the community somewhat.

539
00:36:51,395 --> 00:36:59,500
Rym: Yeah, let's see AOL American punk kids ICQ cool Israeli geeks and geeks from all over the world.

540
00:37:00,022 --> 00:37:13,355
Rym: Yep, yeah English for whom English is not the first language most of the time But at the same time the people anyone who used ICQ back then in that early short period Was generally more geeky than anyone using AOL at the equivalent time.

541
00:37:13,656 --> 00:37:17,200
Scott: Oh, definitely most definitely All right, but then let's talk about the old computers.

542
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:29,900
Scott: So when I was in high school actually, right because around that time, you know The schools are trying to get rid of a lot of the older computers and I sort of got into it And I started to pick up old computers and actually have an Apple to GS in the closet.

543
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,580
Scott: I also have a Mac Plus in the closet with one megabyte of RAM.

544
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,703
Scott: No that first.

545
00:37:33,723 --> 00:37:35,127
Scott: so people understand this right.

546
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:45,452
Scott: the Apple to GS was an Apple to but it came out in 1986 and their GS stands for graphics and sound.

547
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:52,811
Rym: and now I just want to point out for context the 386 was produced from 1986 on right.

548
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:54,000
Scott: So this is the error that they wrote.

549
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,641
Scott: This is an Apple to just like those, you know, when people think of the Apple to they think of the green screen Apple to Right.

550
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,607
Scott: This is that same computer.

551
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:04,376
Scott: It runs the same software as the as the.

552
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:11,696
Scott: you know, the Apple to But there's colors a lot of colors at least compared to an Apple to and a lot of sounds.

553
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:18,644
Scott: you can actually get really good Sound out of this thing and a lot of people today, you know Well, not a lot.

554
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:22,040
Scott: but there are people today who have so much shit hooked up to their Apple to.

555
00:38:22,602 --> 00:38:24,511
Scott: These still use it as a primary computer.

556
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:25,053
Scott: these things.

557
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:26,500
Scott: people have them playing Wolfenstein.

558
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:30,180
Scott: People have them connected to the internet with modems and instant messenger.

559
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,160
Rym: That as cool as this is these people don't know to candle to those Amiga people.

560
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:40,720
Scott: Well, I think the Amiga was somewhat more powerful machine and it's you sort of had to go through less greatly.

561
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,236
Scott: It just shows, you know, the versatility of the Apple to I mean the Apple to is sort of like.

562
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:53,780
Scott: I think if it is Like Wozniak's masterpiece, you know, you open up the Apple to GS and it's just these open slots that are all identical.

563
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:58,140
Scott: It's like perfect for just making it do anything.

564
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:06,186
Scott: it's a it's a beautiful machine and people have overclocked the CPUs install different CPUs in there and It's it.

565
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:08,281
Scott: the Apple to GS is really something beholden I'd.

566
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:12,686
Scott: really there's no reason to get a regular old Apple to except for Historical purposes.

567
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:19,035
Scott: if you can get your hands on a GS and on eBay It's not too hard and I use my GS play some Oregon Trail.

568
00:39:19,115 --> 00:39:20,199
Scott: At least I did a long time ago.

569
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:24,820
Rym: Yeah, except the thing is I I like to own awesome old things.

570
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:33,680
Rym: but I generally don't like to own awesome old computers because I can just emulate the software and The hardware just takes those face and smells vaguely of like old ozone.

571
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:35,574
Scott: I love the way it smells.

572
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:36,460
Scott: it smells so great.

573
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:43,160
Scott: And yeah Plus you never get a flipping the five and a quarter floppies over and then here to go do those noises that the drive makes.

574
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:44,666
Rym: You know, I don't even own.

575
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:48,280
Rym: I used to own this big bundle of five and a quarter floppies.

576
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:52,500
Scott: I don't know where any of them when I have drives, but I'm too many the floppies left.

577
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:56,999
Scott: I need to get some of those because all the images to you know Put on those floppies are online.

578
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,540
Scott: So if I get a five and a quarter drive that could go in my regular computer.

579
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:07,988
Scott: I could then download images of Apple to software put them on those discs In the Apple that someone makes USB ones.

580
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,414
Rym: Oh, maybe I'll definitely bet.

581
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:12,680
Rym: if someone doesn't there's a business opportunity for geeks.

582
00:40:12,922 --> 00:40:14,015
Scott: Yeah, maybe I'll go pick one up.

583
00:40:14,842 --> 00:40:16,729
Scott: Yeah, the Mac Plus people don't realize.

584
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:16,990
Scott: right?

585
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:27,948
Scott: the Mac and the Mac Plus the Mac 512 K Those are the Mac's where it's just one box with a screen and the auto ejecting three and a half inch floppy drive Right under the screen.

586
00:40:28,412 --> 00:40:29,300
Scott: That's what those are.

587
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,587
Scott: I know, you know It's sort of like that's the one we turn it on.

588
00:40:31,627 --> 00:40:34,760
Scott: it goes do and there's a smiley face or more often the brownie.

589
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,927
Scott: Right, that is the first.

590
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,392
Scott: that's the Mac people don't?

591
00:40:38,432 --> 00:40:40,760
Scott: you know, a lot of people don't seem to get this.

592
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:48,959
Scott: You know the difference in their minds very easily, you know, because they weren't you know paying attention back then But the Mac and the Apple to very different very different.

593
00:40:49,562 --> 00:40:58,400
Scott: But the the thing about the Mac is it's kind of crazy that on my IBM PCs You know these four 100 megahertz deals with 16 megs of RAM.

594
00:40:59,383 --> 00:41:02,675
Scott: You were lucky if you had scuzzy and you were super lucky if it worked.

595
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:11,504
Rym: like a hundred times lucky I remember because when I built my first computer, I bought that scuzzy Plex tor 8x burner.

596
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:13,030
Rym: there wasn't even RW.

597
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:13,592
Rym: Yep.

598
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:15,660
Rym: I spent so much money on that stupid thing.

599
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,673
Scott: And I remember when I bought my Pentium 3450, right?

600
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,409
Scott: It was pretty much like IDE drives are normal.

601
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:27,049
Scott: scuzzy drives are way better and way awesome But pretty much your only good if you have a lot of money, so I didn't get those.

602
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,424
Scott: but my Mac 512 K Mac Plus It has scuzzy.

603
00:41:32,444 --> 00:41:33,266
Scott: that's all it has.

604
00:41:33,426 --> 00:41:36,575
Scott: and I have an external 20 megabyte hard drive for it.

605
00:41:36,856 --> 00:41:41,982
Scott: that has Carmen San Diego and a bunch bunch of other things on it and All it is.

606
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:53,260
Scott: you open the box and there's a semi modern ish 20 megabyte Seagate drive in there a Connector a little board a power supply and then a scuzzy connector.

607
00:41:54,382 --> 00:41:57,799
Scott: And it's a 20 megabyte scuzzy drive and it you can boot off it.

608
00:41:58,723 --> 00:42:14,371
Rym: It's just weird to think and I think we've talked about this before but how differently we use computers before they were on the internet and like what computers were foreign computers were pretty much entirely for Typing papers for school and otherwise like tinkering.

609
00:42:14,712 --> 00:42:18,765
Rym: there was nothing to do on a computer to play games Tinker or type something.

610
00:42:19,086 --> 00:42:21,152
Scott: Yep, pretty much or I guess do accounting.

611
00:42:21,754 --> 00:42:26,491
Scott: Yeah, I get you know, if you're doing some sort of business I mean a lot of people there was spreadsheets and that you could do.

612
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:34,638
Scott: a lot of people do print shop things You know like Microsoft publisher stuff like that, you know print out greeting cards If you had a printer, there was a lot of stuff you could do and sort of.

613
00:42:34,658 --> 00:42:37,511
Scott: you know Desktop publishing was really a desktop publishing.

614
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:38,154
Rym: I should add that in.

615
00:42:38,194 --> 00:42:41,827
Rym: but outside of those things There was no reason to use a computer.

616
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:48,820
Rym: and I remember I had a lot of friends who even if their family like I had A computer they didn't use them because they thought they were boring.

617
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,282
Rym: There's nothing.

618
00:42:49,322 --> 00:42:55,058
Scott: the computer is basically a gaming machine that you could also do your homework on And that was it pretty much it.

619
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,320
Rym: No one used it to do anything else except the geeks who would constantly break it and then try to unbreak it.

620
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,499
Scott: Yeah, just constantly fiddling with everything that was on there just to find something to do.

621
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,793
Rym: But I would as a kid spend hours when I found out about MIDI.

622
00:43:07,894 --> 00:43:11,546
Scott: eventually when he had CD roms he had Encyclopedias, but that even those weren't.

623
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:16,420
Rym: so we'd all watch that same 14-second clip of like Martin Luther King saying I have a dream.

624
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:18,445
Scott: Is that in X Microsoft Expedia?

625
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:19,629
Rym: Yes, maybe.

626
00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:23,800
Rym: or that banana spinning in space or I had that Microsoft video.

627
00:43:24,224 --> 00:43:34,976
Rym: It was this uh, oh my god it's a music video called octopus of love and all I remember is that the lyrics were I got a girl who's got eight arms Wraps him around me holds me tight.

628
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:39,960
Rym: It was I was on my computer, I don't know where it came from.

629
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,710
Rym: I don't know if it was from Microsoft or from like one of those multimedia CDs or maybe Media CDs are great.

630
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,120
Rym: Maybe here's from Packard Bell.

631
00:43:47,742 --> 00:43:52,480
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I remember back then it was like all you could get on your computer is what you had a disc for.

632
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:53,959
Scott: So it was all about getting discs.

633
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:56,108
Scott: You know you get as many CDs as you could.

634
00:43:56,148 --> 00:43:59,040
Scott: cuz more CDs meant you could have more stuff cuz you weren't getting anything.

635
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,055
Rym: Other way, I remember buying when we first bought the computer.

636
00:44:02,075 --> 00:44:08,480
Rym: It was called 31 and then in tiny print shareware back to big print games for windows.

637
00:44:10,084 --> 00:44:13,683
Rym: It had Miles bones Solitary.

638
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,031
Scott: I like my house bones.

639
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:17,904
Scott: Oh One other old computer.

640
00:44:17,924 --> 00:44:18,707
Scott: I remember is my.

641
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:21,075
Scott: we had some friends and their dad worked for IBM.

642
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:28,539
Scott: I think he still works for IBM and You know not the same IBM Rym worked for the other one, right, you know in another state.

643
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:30,469
Rym: Well, it was the same IBM.

644
00:44:30,509 --> 00:44:34,877
Scott: Yes, the same big giant company around the world But it was a separate building as he's doing different work.

645
00:44:34,998 --> 00:44:38,627
Scott: Anyway They had an IBM ps1.

646
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:46,700
Scott: now people might notice, you know, oh man on the back of your computer You know most today most mice and keyboards a USB.

647
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,471
Scott: But some people have ps2 mice and keyboards.

648
00:44:49,511 --> 00:44:51,519
Scott: right there the circle things with a bunch of pins in the middle.

649
00:44:52,042 --> 00:45:00,878
Scott: That's called a ps2 port because the IBM ps2 Was the first computer to have those kind of ports and they invented those ports for the mice and keyboards on the IBM ps2.

650
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:07,980
Scott: Before that, you know keyboards use the XT connectors or the AT connectors for the IBM XT or the AT.

651
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:13,152
Scott: The IBM ps1 was what came before the IBM ps2.

652
00:45:13,173 --> 00:45:15,620
Scott: It did not have ps2 ports, but they had this machine.

653
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:23,624
Scott: It was really sort of crazy compared to every other computer out there, you know, if you know There's really nothing else out there.

654
00:45:23,644 --> 00:45:25,790
Scott: That's like an IBM ps1.

655
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:27,956
Scott: I mean we play Monopoly on this thing.

656
00:45:28,438 --> 00:45:29,180
Scott: We play a lot of.

657
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,263
Scott: What's that game?

658
00:45:31,283 --> 00:45:36,320
Scott: like you walk around the school and you like take pictures of the robots and figure out which one's the criminal.

659
00:45:36,782 --> 00:45:40,399
Rym: Oh, yeah, I hated that game, but I remember playing it at school because it's all I could do.

660
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,182
Scott: It was it.

661
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:41,905
Scott: Oh, I love that game.

662
00:45:41,966 --> 00:45:43,933
Scott: It's a great doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

663
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,640
Rym: Oh my god midnight rescue.

664
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:50,860
Scott: Yep, and there was another game just like it where you were an elf on a mountain and these dwarves came up and pestered you.

665
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,018
Scott: But it was this basically the same game and you caught them in a net.

666
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:59,500
Rym: It's a good game was like wizard something or other even though Basically the school had all these games that we were supposed to play.

667
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:12,687
Rym: But I always like every computer in the secret directory for when the either when the real Teacher wasn't around or like you were in the room because you were in the room for some reason or after hours when the cool Teacher who ran the computer club was there.

668
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:15,296
Rym: We had scorched earths tons 40 racing lhx.

669
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:16,340
Rym: That's what I was later.

670
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:20,595
Scott: That was yeah, but that was one thing about this IBM ps1 that I remember so much.

671
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:26,061
Scott: right was that it had prodigy right and Prodigy.

672
00:46:26,442 --> 00:46:28,488
Scott: yeah, but you're what was your prodigy running on.

673
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,153
Rym: I was running it on a 486 486.

674
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:34,895
Scott: prodigy Was nothing like IBM ps1 prodigy.

675
00:46:34,996 --> 00:46:37,305
Scott: I can bet IBM ps1 prodigy.

676
00:46:37,345 --> 00:46:40,715
Scott: first of all a lot of the things that people don't realize this right.

677
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:42,019
Scott: who weren't way around back then?

678
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:44,931
Scott: nowadays When you get an internet connection, it's like aha.

679
00:46:44,951 --> 00:46:45,955
Scott: I'm connected to the internet.

680
00:46:45,995 --> 00:46:48,848
Scott: then you can run any Software that uses internet.

681
00:46:48,868 --> 00:46:53,546
Scott: so you can run Skype you can run aim you can run your web browser Anything that uses the internet connection.

682
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:55,431
Scott: you run and you're always connected.

683
00:46:55,492 --> 00:46:58,200
Scott: right back in the day you would dial up.

684
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,405
Scott: So you weren't always connected.

685
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,854
Scott: you're only connected when you double-clicked on the telephone and you were.

686
00:47:01,895 --> 00:47:03,160
Scott: then you disconnected when you were done.

687
00:47:03,802 --> 00:47:08,301
Scott: Also, the only thing that could really connect was the program We use.

688
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:12,294
Scott: so if you were on prodigy right that that meant that you would double click on prodigy.

689
00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:17,491
Scott: it would connect and you could Do prodigy things and then you close prodigy.

690
00:47:17,511 --> 00:47:18,053
Scott: and that was it.

691
00:47:18,073 --> 00:47:23,249
Scott: you didn't have other internet programs Especially on a non multitasking IBM ps1.

692
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:23,910
Scott: Yep.

693
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:26,758
Rym: I mean, I remember even when I had prodigy it was over 2,400 bought modem.

694
00:47:28,082 --> 00:47:32,675
Rym: I could do more by dialing into local BBS's than I could on prodigy prodigy.

695
00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:39,933
Rym: All I did was well chat and Be the leader of the black guild of our magic the gathering clan.

696
00:47:39,953 --> 00:47:43,564
Scott: Yeah, I remember on the IBM ps1 or that prodigy Mostly what we did.

697
00:47:43,584 --> 00:47:47,240
Scott: it was he played like mad maze because there were a lot of things.

698
00:47:48,203 --> 00:47:49,407
Rym: My modem was too slow.

699
00:47:49,427 --> 00:47:51,312
Scott: No, they had a little faster modem than that.

700
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:53,760
Scott: Plus it was IBM ps1 version of mad maze.

701
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,794
Scott: It was a little different than the later version and you could.

702
00:47:56,814 --> 00:48:00,951
Scott: we would always fill out surveys You know in polls and things give me think about.

703
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:03,120
Scott: a poll now is like a standard feature on the side of a website.

704
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,477
Scott: Imagine if it was like go to the polls and you fill out the polls and see the results.

705
00:48:07,497 --> 00:48:08,120
Scott: It's like oh my gosh.

706
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:10,465
Scott: And that was our.

707
00:48:10,486 --> 00:48:12,639
Scott: that was we'd spend a lot of time doing that because it was fun.

708
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:25,340
Rym: Yeah, I remember I had a pirated copy of Autodesk animator and another pirated copy of a macro media Action, which was that was like free free flash free everything.

709
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:37,800
Rym: it was basically a way to make the what we now call a PowerPoint presentation a Long time ago and let me tell you I would spend hours as a kid because you know with again not online.

710
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:41,322
Rym: There's nothing to do with the computer but fiddle with it Was.

711
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:43,730
Rym: I like figured out the logic of this program cuz I pirated.

712
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:47,542
Rym: I didn't have any instructions or anything and there was no online To tell me what to do.

713
00:48:48,084 --> 00:48:54,942
Rym: making animations by having like fonts and wingdings and pictures move around and embedding video from my multimedia CDs.

714
00:48:55,023 --> 00:48:56,908
Rym: and those were good times.

715
00:48:57,409 --> 00:49:03,600
Rym: I made the credits to a movie that me and my friends never made but kept saying we would Mmm, I made the opening and closing credits.

716
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:08,560
Scott: Yeah, the one thing about prodigies and AOL's and stuff back in those days would it really?

717
00:49:09,365 --> 00:49:20,080
Scott: You know, even though it wasn't it really felt like you know AOL or prodigy were games in themselves and that Basically, you were exploring a lot like and it felt like a lot like how you explore in Metroid or Castlevania.

718
00:49:20,522 --> 00:49:22,412
Rym: Even later the early internet.

719
00:49:22,432 --> 00:49:28,680
Rym: when I first got real internet Like I skipped prodigy I'd prodigy internet and that which was basically prodigy.

720
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:36,184
Rym: But they also let you go in the real internet and even the internet was exploring like I'd go to a website like wow I'm at a website.

721
00:49:36,585 --> 00:49:37,187
Rym: What's here?

722
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:45,660
Rym: And the links from that website weren't just links or citations They were like doors to other parts of the internet and I'd walk around the internet.

723
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,528
Scott: Yeah, nowadays that fascination sort of gone.

724
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:50,213
Scott: It doesn't like that anymore.

725
00:49:50,294 --> 00:49:51,377
Rym: Basically Google killed it.

726
00:49:51,397 --> 00:49:51,758
Rym: Mostly.

727
00:49:51,778 --> 00:49:53,604
Scott: Yeah Google was really the.

728
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:57,056
Rym: Google was the first time I could search for things reliably and it worked.

729
00:49:57,417 --> 00:50:05,200
Rym: I could find when I was looking for like AOL like you could open up the thing and type in a keyword and Sometimes the keyword took you where you want it sometimes took you somewhere scary.

730
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:05,742
Scott: I remember.

731
00:50:05,762 --> 00:50:09,880
Scott: I said they're all these like, you know, they're a secret hidden keywords people talk about.

732
00:50:10,101 --> 00:50:10,502
Rym: I would go to.

733
00:50:10,523 --> 00:50:12,129
Rym: I remember their rumors around my school.

734
00:50:12,169 --> 00:50:15,465
Rym: people are like if you type in this keyword they give this long Keyword.

735
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,960
Rym: it'll show you boobs.

736
00:50:17,821 --> 00:50:28,900
Scott: Yeah, like you click here here and here There's like a bunch of games to download and play and there was like a bunch of crappy games You could download and and I remember we'd sit there on cuz prodigy had a similar to AOL keyword thing.

737
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:35,839
Rym: I remember we'd sit with our friends like late at night and we'd type in random keywords and see what it found us.

738
00:50:37,052 --> 00:50:40,531
Rym: Mm-hmm Demystification is a sad thing.

739
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:41,437
Rym: I don't know.

740
00:50:41,477 --> 00:50:41,860
Rym: It's weird.

741
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:51,530
Rym: I we said this about calculators and I hate to say things like this because it's always the thing that the old man says Kids today using their fancy calculators.

742
00:50:51,830 --> 00:51:05,200
Rym: slide rules made me a better man, but at the same time The fact that the computer was only useful either to do tasks play games or Tweak it and explore it to no end whatsoever.

743
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,758
Rym: I feel like that is what gave me my love of computers more than anything else ever could.

744
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:17,914
Scott: yeah I really think that's why you know people today even like younger people, you know There's always the stereotype that younger people know how to use technology.

745
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:18,718
Scott: the older people don't.

746
00:51:18,798 --> 00:51:24,558
Scott: well They know how to use they know how to do their myspaces and their whatnot, but they don't know used to.

747
00:51:24,578 --> 00:51:33,340
Scott: you know Generation, you know because our generation of people when we were kids some people used computers and some people didn't right.

748
00:51:33,441 --> 00:51:35,721
Scott: It wasn't like every kid was using one like now It was.

749
00:51:35,921 --> 00:51:37,908
Scott: we used them other people didn't use them.

750
00:51:37,948 --> 00:51:52,339
Scott: and the people who did because of the nature of the machines Available at the time to the average person those who did Actually learned, you know, if you were a PC gamer in those days of DOS you learned about.

751
00:51:52,379 --> 00:51:55,813
Scott: you know Memory and low memory and boot disks and batch file.

752
00:51:55,833 --> 00:52:04,320
Rym: that knowledge is obsolete today Like knowing how to move stuff into high memory and the difference between extended and expanded memory is useless today.

753
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,716
Scott: Well, it's if you're guessing if you're writing x86 assembly DOS stuff today.

754
00:52:08,756 --> 00:52:09,780
Rym: Well, then it's useful, right?

755
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,431
Rym: all right, really it's useless.

756
00:52:11,472 --> 00:52:24,900
Rym: but the Process of figuring that out on my own because there was no one to tell me there was no internet to tell there was nothing I would sit there and like I heard rumors that high mem and mem maker gave you more memory

757
00:52:25,501 --> 00:52:25,642
Scott: And so

758
00:52:25,722 --> 00:52:28,189
Rym: I typed them and they broke things.

759
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,776
Rym: but then I learned what they did and turning off smart drive.

760
00:52:31,157 --> 00:52:31,699
Rym: Oh my god.

761
00:52:32,802 --> 00:52:39,280
Scott: But I think that because of that is sort of the reason that you know when we have a problem with computers.

762
00:52:39,401 --> 00:52:41,960
Scott: Well, we generally don't or it's a hardware problem.

763
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:48,569
Scott: We couldn't do anything about just broke and other people are asking us questions That could be answered just by typing the question into Google.

764
00:52:48,950 --> 00:53:02,770
Scott: and I think if you really want to know and learn Computers for real maybe it's worth your time Maybe to go and get like an old computer and sort of you know Play with it and explore it and and sort of figure it out.

765
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:03,613
Rym: You know what here it is.

766
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:04,858
Rym: buy and find a 486 somewhere.

767
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:10,440
Rym: they're not that hard to find and Hardware is better because you'll learn a lot of really weird stuff.

768
00:53:10,865 --> 00:53:13,518
Rym: But I guess a Plex like emulator or something would work.

769
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:21,619
Rym: Get an old DOS game like fantasy empires or something and just try to without looking online Get it installed.

770
00:53:22,447 --> 00:53:29,258
Rym: Mmm, like from the discs Mmm, yeah, you'll learn more from doing that and get the sound to work.

771
00:53:30,464 --> 00:53:31,488
Rym: You might be asking too much.

772
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:34,743
Rym: You realize that I never got the sound to work and have my games I play.

773
00:53:34,783 --> 00:53:36,250
Scott: I got the sound to work in every game.

774
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,801
Scott: cuz I had a Sound Blaster 16.

775
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:40,387
Rym: I had a Forte 16.

776
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:41,029
Scott: That's right.

777
00:53:41,189 --> 00:53:42,714
Rym: That isn't some ad-lib bullshit.

778
00:53:42,835 --> 00:53:47,469
Scott: I had is perfect a Completely average run-of-the-mill Sound Blaster 16.

779
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:50,920
Scott: So in every single game I said I have a Sound Blaster 16.

780
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,302
Scott: That means you're gonna work and it said hells.

781
00:53:52,322 --> 00:53:55,446
Rym: Yes, but I I I came.

782
00:53:55,466 --> 00:54:13,754
Rym: I didn't come before you obviously, but I superseded you because I remember when I Was really getting into music and I had like a keyboard and I remember one day Like I was playing with my Casio CT 655 and you know I was looking at the back of it and I was trying to figure out cuz all these other things.

783
00:54:14,176 --> 00:54:24,909
Rym: and finally I was like what the fuck is that MIDI thing anyway and About a month later as I'd figured all this out went to my dad and I said dad I need an upgrade to the computer.

784
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,220
Rym: I need a sound card.

785
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,795
Rym: He was like it makes sound and I was like, no, it doesn't make real sound.

786
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:31,940
Rym: I can make it make real sound.

787
00:54:32,344 --> 00:54:38,414
Rym: he was real dubious and Eventually, I don't think he understood what I was trying to explain and I didn't really understood.

788
00:54:38,796 --> 00:54:39,960
Rym: but he said how much of this cost?

789
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,683
Rym: I said, I don't know.

790
00:54:40,723 --> 00:54:41,305
Rym: Let's go see.

791
00:54:41,947 --> 00:54:43,533
Rym: and when it was under $100.

792
00:54:43,533 --> 00:54:44,215
Rym: He let me buy it.

793
00:54:45,018 --> 00:54:50,323
Rym: I bought a SoundBlaster advanced wave effects 32.

794
00:54:50,323 --> 00:54:56,288
Scott: that's fine because my next sound card was a Sound Blaster live value Which I still have and still works and it goes on CCI slot.

795
00:54:56,368 --> 00:55:01,705
Rym: the live came so far after the all 32 But that live.

796
00:55:01,805 --> 00:55:07,042
Scott: I was rocking the 4.1 surround with the EAX back in 98 99.

797
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:09,590
Rym: you realized in the Linux box.

798
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:10,472
Rym: I got going here.

799
00:55:10,793 --> 00:55:13,200
Rym: I'm still using my Sound Blaster live.

800
00:55:13,845 --> 00:55:18,391
Rym: I'm using my onboard and video Platinum, but you know what for recording the show.

801
00:55:18,412 --> 00:55:22,668
Rym: I have a $20 External USB sound card.

802
00:55:23,009 --> 00:55:25,639
Rym: that is better than any sound card I ever owned.

803
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,875
Rym: But the point is I got the all 32 and the thing is the all 32 was just.

804
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:34,942
Rym: it was basically two sound cards in One.

805
00:55:35,344 --> 00:55:38,180
Rym: it had a Sound Blaster 16 just in it complete.

806
00:55:38,361 --> 00:55:39,163
Rym: It worked perfectly.

807
00:55:39,183 --> 00:55:43,836
Rym: it also had basically a MIDI card and they had there were.

808
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:51,619
Rym: it had separate DMAs and separate memory addresses and I remember in TIE fighter which hitherto it had no sound.

809
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:55,156
Rym: I Did the configuration after I got this all 32 installed?

810
00:55:55,176 --> 00:56:03,180
Rym: I figured it out And I and I set up the wave sounds and all those things to play from the Sound Blaster.

811
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:05,228
Scott: Also the red book audio from the CD.

812
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,980
Rym: Yes, all that played through the Sound Blaster.

813
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:16,530
Rym: but there I could specify in TIE fighter and a lot of other games a Separate memory location to send the MIDI information to.

814
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:24,648
Rym: so it played the MIDI which was all the music in that game from this separate thing and It was like night and day.

815
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:30,900
Rym: it sounded better than I had ever heard it sound before Because the MIDI just sounded like crap on the old Sound Blaster.

816
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:33,735
Scott: Yeah, the MIDI is like people don't realize this right MIDI.

817
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:34,700
Scott: we could do a show.

818
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,667
Scott: I'll have to do a show on MIDI but some day.

819
00:56:36,707 --> 00:56:40,763
Scott: the MIDI basically instruments that were in the Sound Blaster 16.

820
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:41,610
Scott: They're classic.

821
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:42,700
Scott: I love them, right?

822
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,436
Scott: But if you take those same MIDI files and send them to a modern sound card or even to an all 32.

823
00:56:48,436 --> 00:56:53,020
Rym: Yeah It's completely different because it had sound fonts.

824
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:59,357
Rym: I could load different instruments into my sound card on the low level in its own memory.

825
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:07,106
Rym: Oh my god I would go around like I remember I would invite friends over and we would sit around Listening to MIDI files.

826
00:57:07,306 --> 00:57:13,126
Scott: Yeah, because they're basically MIDI is a set of instructions that tells a machine You know what to play.

827
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:24,340
Scott: so they'd a with the instrument in this memory address Say hit the drum now and then again now and then again now and then now three times, you know It's just instructions on how to play a music.

828
00:57:25,681 --> 00:57:31,640
Scott: So if you have a Sound Blaster 16, you just send a MIDI file to it, you know, how does it play this file?

829
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,779
Scott: Well, it has in digital instruments in it and it plays them.

830
00:57:35,522 --> 00:57:45,393
Scott: If your sound card is different or better digital instruments in it the same file the same set of instructions will sound different Because what's actually generating the noise is different.

831
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:47,120
Scott: it's interpreting those instructions differently.

832
00:57:47,941 --> 00:57:53,400
Scott: It's not like a an actual analog wave recorded like you'll get an mp3 or wave file.

833
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:59,120
Scott: It's you know, just you know, it's like sheet music if I give the same sheet music to different people with two different instruments.

834
00:57:59,582 --> 00:58:03,100
Scott: Right, so different sound cards are different instruments when it comes to MIDI.

835
00:58:03,642 --> 00:58:11,140
Scott: So when I played MIDI files in the Sound Blaster live and they didn't sound like the Sound Blaster 16 I was simultaneously amazed and disappointed.

836
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,493
Scott: Okay, this show didn't have a lot of focus but I don't really care.

837
00:58:16,513 --> 00:58:17,055
Scott: that's fine.

838
00:58:17,255 --> 00:58:18,480
Rym: it's all Dave and Joel style.

839
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:27,015
Scott: I wanted to talk more about like, you know, the old nostalgia of taking an Apple 2 and you know The noises when you turn it on and the smells and the.

840
00:58:27,357 --> 00:58:30,410
Rym: I remember the old nostalgia of holding down f5 to boot into.

841
00:58:30,691 --> 00:58:33,810
Rym: I remember the old nostalgia of breaking into the computer in the over here to go.

842
00:58:37,382 --> 00:58:43,905
Rym: Every time I turned on an old computer it checked to see if there was a floppy to boot You want me to go to.

843
00:58:43,945 --> 00:58:46,377
Scott: I can go plug the computers in and turn them on.

844
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:47,080
Scott: we can hear the noise.

845
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,460
Rym: I have the drive death rattle of a cup when you and you know it.

846
00:58:50,642 --> 00:58:55,917
Rym: I remember as a kid sitting there and you know you'd be in the computer lab like after school and someone's loading up a game.

847
00:58:55,937 --> 00:59:07,920
Rym: or they're like They've got the disc with their project and they're gonna like read it and then you hear And then suddenly everyone looks over because we all know that that disc is fucked.

848
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,570
Scott: Yeah, hi floppies are so bad.

849
00:59:11,152 --> 00:59:12,800
Rym: remember you could make a bomb out of a floppy.

850
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,627
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

851
00:59:14,748 --> 00:59:16,076
Rym: You can't do that with the CD.

852
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:18,663
Scott: No All right.

853
00:59:18,803 --> 00:59:20,048
Scott: I think the show is over.

854
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:20,651
Rym: I don't know.

855
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:21,956
Rym: we talked a lot about other stuff.

856
00:59:21,996 --> 00:59:22,920
Rym: I talked about my skis.

857
00:59:22,981 --> 00:59:23,284
Rym: I'm excited.

858
00:59:23,324 --> 00:59:23,768
Rym: Oh, yeah.

859
00:59:24,071 --> 00:59:26,679
Rym: Oh, yeah The stock market, right?

860
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,480
Rym: So on Friday like went down a whole bunch and it was ready to put this in the wrong part of the show.

861
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:34,992
Rym: I just it's a it's a. it's not a stinger, but it's a follow-up it.

862
00:59:35,473 --> 00:59:48,261
Rym: so I was sitting at work and I'm working on stuff and I'm in this meeting and I'm working on stuff and listening and talking working listening talking and Then I notice that the Dow has just gotten to 9,000.

863
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:52,093
Rym: Oh, so I go to YouTube and I turn my speakers up and I play.
