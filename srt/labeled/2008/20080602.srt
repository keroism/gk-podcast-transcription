1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,828
Scott: It's Monday June 2nd.

2
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:12,751
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:13,694
Rym: I'm Red.

4
00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:15,720
Scott: This is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:17,999
Scott: denial of service attacks.

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:36,480
Rym: So over the weekend, we did something that until now has really never been done in the history of humanity.

8
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:36,701
Rym: It's.

9
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,740
Rym: it was kind of amazing and I can't believe we pulled it off.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,202
Scott: why do I?

11
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:48,080
Scott: I don't a brag but I was the person who suggested it and I'm betting that without my Constant prodding it would not have occurred.

12
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:50,168
Rym: I don't know about constant prodding.

13
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:50,830
Scott: I prodded.

14
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:52,597
Scott: I prodded at least four times.

15
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:54,406
Rym: It was pretty much Hey, let's do it.

16
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:59,187
Rym: And then we all went around getting everybody Your eyes before that moment.

17
00:00:59,328 --> 00:01:02,680
Scott: I had prodded to do it like three times when you just weren't there.

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,928
Scott: I was prodding not you.

19
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:05,719
Scott: I was prodding James and other people's.

20
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,047
Rym: But yeah, we over the weekend.

21
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:09,675
Rym: Well, actually it was a crazy weekend.

22
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:16,180
Rym: first on Friday We stayed in the city and we interviewed Hal Cali, you know with Brian Nishi Tokyo FM all that fun stuff.

23
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:17,757
Scott: Yeah, we'll talk about that a little bit later.

24
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:22,838
Rym: for that We ate once again at that place right next to Grand Central Central Cafe slash Pershing Square.

25
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:24,725
Scott: Yep I really want to get that breakfast.

26
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:26,491
Rym: Well this weekend at the mocha.

27
00:01:26,892 --> 00:01:27,916
Scott: Nah, it's out true.

28
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:36,360
Rym: I think that's gonna happen Yep, but then immediately in the morning, we attempted to drive out to James and Lisa's wedding, huh?

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,477
Rym: Which was somewhat held up by the fact that Scott suddenly decided out of the blue.

30
00:01:41,497 --> 00:01:43,187
Scott: We're like, alright It wasn't out of the blue.

31
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:44,776
Scott: Basically what had happened in the morning?

32
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:49,588
Rym: I'm like, alright, I'm gonna pack and then we'll go and Scott's like, oh, yeah Well, I got I'm out of deodorant.

33
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:51,280
Rym: So we got to go to the grocery store so I can buy some.

34
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:54,314
Rym: Oh, yeah, and I got to get an oil change on the way.

35
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,420
Rym: So I'll stop and do that.

36
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,100
Scott: Well, basically what I tried to get an oil change earlier and I failed.

37
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:06,689
Scott: You know when I had a day off and then I failed and failed and then I realized hey We're gonna pass by one on our way kinda.

38
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,000
Scott: Yeah, and I'm like, hey, you know, we'll just we'll just go and get it.

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,294
Rym: Yeah, so we're gonna pass by and it happens to me next to a grocery store.

40
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:14,118
Scott: So how convenient?

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,840
Rym: yeah Except we're gonna pass by a valvoline on a Saturday late morning Which is pretty much when everyone in the world decides to get oil change.

42
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,855
Scott: Yeah, so I decided not to get an oil change which was a good thing.

43
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:24,740
Scott: as it turns out.

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,030
Rym: Yes, but the problem here is that because we'd gotten off the freeway to get the oil change Scott got on the wrong road.

45
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:47,840
Scott: Well, basically we live on interstate 84. any 84 crosses with 87 and those are like the two ways to get upstate are either take 87 and then 90 or take 84 to 17 to 86. no to 81 81 86 is 70.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,406
Scott: I know 86 slash 17. see the real trick 81 to 690 90.

47
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:50,088
Rym: the real trick is 690.

48
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,312
Scott: that takes you around Syracuse.

49
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,449
Rym: Yep, you don't want to get on 481.

50
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:59,600
Scott: Well you do if you want to go out even to the crazy places.

51
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:03,640
Rym: Well, you see it on 41, I guess if you're going east, but who would be going east?

52
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,282
Scott: Well, you can.

53
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:11,259
Scott: you can also take 86. you can go to 390 instead of 690 Doesn't go all the way there yet.

54
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,874
Rym: So it's like freeway freeway freeway and then like 25 miles of 35 mile an hour one-horse towns.

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:31,101
Scott: Yeah Anyway, the point is is that since I'm just just I knew that we were going to try to take 17 8 86 up instead of taking you know, 87 to 90 which and it is a much faster route to take these 17 slash 86.

56
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:34,920
Rym: Yep, because I go back actually kind of often cuz no Emily's family's out in Rochester.

57
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:36,419
Scott: That's the way we came home.

58
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:48,858
Scott: The only issue was is because just being over in You know the place where we got off for the oil change when I'm over there My natural instinct is just get on 87 north and I did and I'm like, oops

59
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,256
Rym: Yeah, the worst thing is he's going toward 87 north.

60
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:52,418
Rym: I'm like Scott.

61
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:54,186
Rym: Why are you getting on the throughway?

62
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:58,320
Rym: and by then it was way too late for him to get off the throughway and the next?

63
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,939
Rym: Exit was in Poughkeepsie at which point we might as well just stay on the stupid through way and go through all the.

64
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:04,864
Scott: yeah I was like Rym.

65
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:08,180
Scott: if we lived in Poughkeepsie, would you have gone south and then gone?

66
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,908
Scott: You know West 17 or would you go just north?

67
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,543
Rym: Well, if I here's the problem if I lived in Poughkeepsie, I would have gone south Really?

68
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:19,440
Rym: The reason is if you're in Poughkeepsie, you can't just get on the throughway.

69
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:24,780
Rym: You actually have to take 299 way across and that's like the worst road to be on.

70
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,130
Rym: It's true because we were.

71
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:36,260
Rym: you know, we're at the same latitude longitude Latitude latitude as Poughkeepsie, but if you want to go east-west to get to Poughkeepsie, you actually have to drive a ways.

72
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:43,749
Scott: Yeah, anyway, so We just be took a slower way there But we still got there before almost everybody.

73
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,104
Rym: Scott Johnson who actually went to Rochester the day before, you know The old stomping ground.

74
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:53,165
Scott: Yeah, only the people who had to be there earlier or decided to be there earlier We're there before us.

75
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,434
Rym: I think the best party's crew people.

76
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:56,860
Scott: I'm sure family people were there first.

77
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:59,020
Rym: I worried like we're running so late whatever.

78
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,130
Rym: Nah, because we also independently of all that we're.

79
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,360
Rym: I was super slow waking up and I I didn't even packed it here.

80
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,720
Rym: It's Scott and we're just like whatever and we're slow and then we're about to go.

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,663
Rym: We're just gonna grab Emily and get on the road and we see oh There's Alex.

82
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,088
Rym: He hasn't got left yet.

83
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:14,830
Rym: There's his van.

84
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,227
Scott: Yeah, but it was good because you know Despite getting there early.

85
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:21,915
Scott: We had a lot of time.

86
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:42,060
Scott: just sit around and do nothing Which is great considering we haven't had a lot of that lately, you know I was able to sit around and read comics and not worry about anything because I was in a hotel with the broken Wi-Fi and Alright, and that brings us to the next point Which is we're gonna we're gonna change some stuff up here because we have no time

87
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:42,723
Rym: Yes.

88
00:05:43,024 --> 00:05:47,727
Rym: Now if we were just gonna keep doing GeekNights as is forever We'd probably would have kept the old format.

89
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,500
Rym: But basically we've been for a long time.

90
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,840
Rym: We got a lot of side projects and I think that most of them are pretty much as cool as GeekNights.

91
00:05:56,383 --> 00:06:09,679
Rym: But by doing GeekNights four nights a week we really can't do any of those other projects in a reasonable span of time and in addition to that the The quality of GeekNights degrades as we continue to force ourselves to.

92
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,460
Scott: you know Sort of use all our ideas up really quickly.

93
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:21,885
Rym: Well part of it was that I think the catalyst was one that Scott his work schedule changed so he gets home like way late And you get home way early.

94
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:24,012
Rym: So I get home at like five something.

95
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:25,638
Scott: But you're also waking up way early.

96
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:33,340
Scott: Yeah Yeah, so that mismatch there of shifting sort of you know an hour in each direction sort of screwed us up a bit Which would have been fine.

97
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:50,607
Rym: but the other problem was you know we got the camera we ought to make some video and we got all these programming projects and we're doing more and more live stuff and we're we're kind of expanding in every direction and Basically, it's either do all of that or do four nights of GeekNights four nights a week Like we've been doing for the last 500 episodes.

98
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:54,960
Scott: Yes, so we have decided that you know, I mean you can't reasonably expect.

99
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:59,914
Scott: Yeah, anyone who thinks that GeekNights is gonna continue without changing forever.

100
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,780
Scott: You're sadly mistake.

101
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,580
Rym: I wonder if you people realize that we almost completely changed the format and the music and everything at the beginning of season two.

102
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:09,226
Scott: Well, we wanted to.

103
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:10,009
Rym: we almost did.

104
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,237
Rym: I had the music all set up and I always didn't do it.

105
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:13,060
Scott: news didn't do it.

106
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:18,002
Scott: Yeah, we should do it eventually maybe for season for season 100 I don't know.

107
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:23,020
Scott: But anyway, so yeah temporarily what we're gonna do is we're gonna do two episodes a week.

108
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:29,460
Scott: So that's gonna be this week will be a Monday and a Wednesday show and next week We'll make a Tuesday and a Thursday show.

109
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:36,240
Scott: So actually each of the four separate GeekNights shows will come out to once every other week.

110
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,164
Scott: So it'll be Monday.

111
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:38,190
Scott: wait two weeks.

112
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,114
Scott: There'll be another Monday.

113
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:40,280
Scott: Wait two weeks will be another Monday.

114
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,020
Scott: So think of it as four podcasts that are separate and each one is bi-weekly.

115
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:57,360
Rym: That's a little frightening though because pretty much the only other anime podcasts out there, you know anime world order and fast karate I mean fast karate updated kind of a similar rate, but they might put out more shows than us now.

116
00:07:57,642 --> 00:08:01,312
Scott: Well, at least they might put out more animation.

117
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:04,080
Scott: well Yeah, they do two shows a week.

118
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:12,640
Scott: So our animation they'll put up the same number of shows as us But they will be putting out more anime shows because they'll do an anime show every week in a game show every week.

119
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,403
Scott: But we will.

120
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:20,152
Rym: we have the technology and also the Thursday shows coming out, but regardless We don't know how long this will be.

121
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:21,060
Rym: It's a temporary thing.

122
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,940
Rym: Think of it as like a mini sabbatical except for spending our sabbatical working.

123
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:25,201
Rym: But

124
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:39,779
Scott: also now you know how all the time we would say things like we're gonna have merch we're gonna have video We're gonna have this and that and the other thing and with those things never appear Those things are actually going to appear although I was still will not commit to any timeline.

125
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:47,460
Rym: Yes No, I gotta say wait till you guys see our first t-shirt and Wait till you see our second t-shirt, which is now just a concept.

126
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:50,633
Rym: But the concept is so badass that I'm looking forward to it already.

127
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:51,175
Scott: And what do you see?

128
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:52,058
Scott: some of these videos?

129
00:08:52,119 --> 00:09:03,136
Scott: I mean The videos aren't gonna be like, you know, super awesome to begin with not gonna be college humor quality No, but we're working up to it and I think they'll entertain you regardless.

130
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,382
Rym: Yeah Right.

131
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:10,120
Rym: So but anyway also over the weekend, you know, like I said, we were James and Lisa's wedding.

132
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,620
Rym: I don't know if we should even wait and use like a whole Thursday show about the wedding itself.

133
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:16,388
Scott: We could do it next week.

134
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:28,720
Rym: It was kind of an epic confluence something that hasn't happened in a long time where Basically with very few exceptions the entire front row crew was in one place at one time.

135
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:40,731
Scott: Yeah, like even you know, there are even people I haven't seen in like years who we were really close with but we sort of You know got distanced and then it's like oh my god I can't believe you're here and then it was like I'd.

136
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:42,580
Scott: you know, I talked to them yesterday.

137
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:44,447
Rym: I mean God who is missing in that picture?

138
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:47,518
Scott: We're missing like Nuri Nuri Evan and that's it.

139
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:49,331
Rym: I can't think of anyone else.

140
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:50,420
Rym: we're missing from that picture.

141
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,780
Scott: Of course the one person that they think was missing is gonna be like crying that someone's gonna be out there.

142
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:56,958
Rym: You know who you are?

143
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:06,299
Rym: Yeah, but the one thing I can say about the wedding for now is that it was very very geeky But it was also very subtly and classily geeky.

144
00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:08,866
Rym: I mean the vase we brought back.

145
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:13,760
Rym: there are all these little touches like the cufflinks with the with the GBA's and the Gameboys.

146
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:25,140
Scott: Yeah, it wasn't like, you know You go to a bar mitzvah and the theme is like overt like there's just Nintendo characters all over the place like a kid's birthday Party where you have little hats that have Mario on them and plates with Pokemon on them.

147
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,020
Scott: It wasn't like that, but I had a video game themed wedding.

148
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:40,576
Scott: But if you were not a nerd and you did not look closely You would not have known it would have looked like just a generic wedding, you know flowers and colors also, we danced to Numa Numa and the bride got Rick rolled.

149
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:46,960
Scott: that was And that was the Rick rolling was not even a front row crew.

150
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,943
Scott: Responsibleness.

151
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:53,300
Rym: No, it wasn't but that's that's part of it was that the family and the families involved have some geekery going on.

152
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:54,971
Scott: Anyway, that's for sure.

153
00:10:55,233 --> 00:11:04,623
Rym: It was it was epic Yeah, also the front row crew in together like that outside of the context of the geek house and beacon which I guess You know.

154
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:07,402
Rym: Scott always says hey, it doesn't matter where we are We just hang out.

155
00:11:07,422 --> 00:11:09,370
Rym: but context matters a lot.

156
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:24,840
Rym: because the context of the geek house You kind of fall into these mores of these tropes where we watch the YouTube videos and we watch the Horatio We play the D&D and we do this and that and this and that and then we go eat at the cafe Maya But suddenly we're in a different context and everything changed.

157
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:35,425
Scott: I think the also the combination of people also matters, you know It's like when you see someone you haven't seen in a long time You're gonna be talking to them a lot more Every other week.

158
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,714
Rym: I talked to like Steve Pomeroy in any depth.

159
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:39,320
Rym: I was still working at IBM.

160
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,594
Scott: Yeah, I mean the last time I talked to him like in person was years ago But I you know, I am to maybe like less than 20 times since then.

161
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:49,380
Scott: Yeah, so it's kind of crazy.

162
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:58,933
Rym: so there will be some some epic pictures coming up, of course, the other thing that probably added the experience was the Serious amount of alcohol consumption zero by me.

163
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:00,157
Rym: Yeah zero by Scott.

164
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:00,819
Rym: I made up for that.

165
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:07,340
Rym: great All right, so this is the new improved gig night.

166
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,520
Scott: Yeah, and we can talk long like this because we're only doing two a week and we still have the same out.

167
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,889
Scott: It's you know storage space to fill up.

168
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,399
Scott: So yeah, it doesn't matter this episodes go a little weird.

169
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,180
Rym: Who gives a shit the moment we started like we decided?

170
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,100
Rym: All right, we're gonna split this up and we're gonna cut back on the shows.

171
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:29,560
Rym: I pretty much have things to talk about as this kind of opening bit for like the next two weeks of the normal schedule.

172
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:37,180
Scott: That's what I'm thinking is that by doing the fewer shows right it's like I only have to watch one anime every two weeks.

173
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:48,606
Scott: So not only am I saving that sort of one hour of time from not doing the show one week But I'm having to watch less anime in order to keep up you know with having something to talk about.

174
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:56,380
Scott: and that is where the real time savings is gonna come in and that's where that is the Act that the time the time where we actually sit down and record.

175
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:59,751
Scott: Getting that hour back isn't really gonna help me put out a video.

176
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:06,935
Rym: not having to watch two anime series Not having to not watch two anime series exactly.

177
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:10,484
Scott: It's gonna allow me to watch Make a video.

178
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:13,814
Rym: I mean, I'm almost done with princess tutu and I'm working through Kazen.

179
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,878
Rym: Oh, yo Jimbo pretty quick.

180
00:13:14,898 --> 00:13:17,886
Scott: All right Anyway, we're good to come.

181
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:18,830
Rym: Yeah, the only thing though.

182
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:21,740
Rym: Oh, so, you know, we're doing the show the different schedule.

183
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:28,739
Rym: well now like we always said the show quality should go up because Theoretically we have more time to research and put stuff together and it'll be kind of badass.

184
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,248
Rym: but Because this is the first of those shows.

185
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:35,138
Rym: We did not save any time from this show.

186
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:39,996
Scott: Well, I mean We spent the last three four days in the middle of nowhere with no internet.

187
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:40,558
Scott: So there's no.

188
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,280
Scott: How are we gonna prepare for this particular episode?

189
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:59,799
Rym: I think that is why we have to do the separate show about the wedding because that is basically going to be two shows first The wedding and the crew and everything but second the fact that Geneva, New York I don't want to really disparage the town, but does anyone live there?

190
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,481
Scott: I think I've realized how the economy works though They all.

191
00:14:03,502 --> 00:14:05,531
Scott: they just sell wine to other the rest of the world.

192
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,400
Rym: wine and weddings wine and weddings.

193
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:07,842
Rym: It's.

194
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:09,090
Rym: it was a pretty desolate play.

195
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,860
Rym: I mean we thought oh, there's a cute little Main Street.

196
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,444
Rym: Let's go down.

197
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:12,913
Scott: and there was a really good cafe.

198
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:14,140
Scott: other means there was anyway.

199
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:17,332
Scott: So we should get into some technologies before people go crazy.

200
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:18,597
Rym: I have any tech news.

201
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:21,460
Scott: I do indeed Ram have you been in my room lately?

202
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,123
Rym: No, no.

203
00:14:23,425 --> 00:14:25,257
Rym: Anyway, I don't really go into your room.

204
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:31,382
Rym: that often I mean what the studio is in my room and my room is also the room that has enough like we can hang out in It.

205
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:31,747
Rym: it's big.

206
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:32,660
Rym: There's a lot of floor space.

207
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,879
Rym: So why would I go to your room on the other side of the house read some comics?

208
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,514
Rym: Well, I guess yeah, but I haven't read any comics lately.

209
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:45,159
Rym: Yeah, maybe you should know You'll bring the comics out and you'll give them to me and then when I'm done with them you take them back.

210
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:46,986
Scott: I don't always take it back.

211
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:48,411
Scott: Anyway in my room.

212
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:57,912
Scott: There's a computer case and on top of that computer case I believe are no less than six power supplies four of which Definitely work one of which might work and one definitely doesn't.

213
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,643
Scott: one of them is really high-quality One.

214
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:03,954
Scott: a couple of them one is dented, but I think it works, but it's scary.

215
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,084
Scott: one's also works But it's scary and is very.

216
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:15,890
Scott: they range from lots of watts to not so many watts and there's an also another Really good perfectly working one downstairs in under the stairs.

217
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:18,737
Scott: So I get a lot of power supplies.

218
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:22,229
Scott: I Don't nearly have that many computers now.

219
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,947
Rym: beyond that we have multiple motherboards some work Some don't piles of ran all these hard drives.

220
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,010
Rym: They're completely useless.

221
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:29,531
Scott: Yep.

222
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:31,376
Rym: I still have that 12-inch CRT.

223
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:36,259
Rym: That came with the first computer I ever owned.

224
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:40,280
Rym: I used it in college as my aim and win amp monitor.

225
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:44,040
Scott: I built that new computer and the new computer was mostly new parts.

226
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,637
Scott: I didn't port over a lot of parts from old computers, you know, I mostly ported over data from old computers.

227
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:59,299
Scott: So when I tried to take the old computer out of the case and Transplant it and I sort of broke things and you know, I'm a lot of the parts I have just don't work.

228
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:01,200
Rym: I just we used to be a lot more careful.

229
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,680
Rym: I remember when I know I like any computer part would get used and all man.

230
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,910
Scott: Well, I mean when I was in high school, I had a thousand dollars.

231
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,120
Scott: I bought a computer that was like, holy shit.

232
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,576
Scott: But now it's like I bought a computer.

233
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,866
Rym: All right Yeah But the other thing is get work.

234
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,854
Rym: technology is moving fast enough to where we have.

235
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:21,252
Rym: we have more Obsolete computer technology than modern computer technology in this house.

236
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:30,620
Scott: Yeah, so and of all that obsolete computer technology I had to get Alex to give us a motherboard so to be able to make one fully working computer.

237
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:37,673
Scott: That's mostly working and we could have used Shehzar but we didn't because that's not a hundred percent working.

238
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:42,954
Rym: everything works, but one of the USB headers It's still not a hundred percent work in the Northbridge fan.

239
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:44,724
Scott: It's not a hundred percent work It is.

240
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:46,860
Scott: I wanted to make a hundred percent working machine anyway.

241
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:52,960
Scott: So I got all these computer parts some working some not but not enough to actually do anything useful with.

242
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:54,379
Scott: So what do I do with them?

243
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,400
Scott: So I was thinking of finding one of those places where they build computers and then give them to people who don't have computers.

244
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:03,178
Scott: But I couldn't actually find one of those places near here.

245
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,067
Scott: I think they're in California those places.

246
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,292
Scott: so I was like, huh?

247
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:06,855
Scott: What do I do?

248
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,920
Scott: I can't just throw it out.

249
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:14,540
Scott: I mean you can't you know throw out computer parts just like you can't throw out a television, you know, it's big fancy electronics.

250
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,060
Scott: They're not disposable things in the trash.

251
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:22,060
Scott: You have to get rid of them Especially like you have to get rid of car batteries in a special way and get rid of tires.

252
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,615
Rym: I know a lot of you out there probably do just throw these things away, but you really shouldn't be.

253
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,482
Rym: they're not good to be In the garbage.

254
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:29,569
Scott: Yeah, it's not something as power supply.

255
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,639
Scott: especially it's not something you can put in the trash or a CRT.

256
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:42,833
Scott: Yeah, a stick of RAM isn't gonna be so bad but even then you don't want to throw that out in the trash right and plus think about how Complicated piece of machinery that is and you're just gonna throw it out.

257
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:44,680
Scott: Like it's it's such a complicated thing.

258
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,270
Scott: It has value just even if it's not working now.

259
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,997
Rym: We've had trouble in the past.

260
00:17:49,057 --> 00:17:58,365
Rym: I mean we had the 1974 color RCA that sat outside on our back porch for almost a month because we couldn't figure out how to throw it away And no one would take it.

261
00:17:58,405 --> 00:17:59,230
Scott: It still worked.

262
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,880
Rym: Yeah, that was the scariest thing.

263
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:07,912
Rym: We plug that bastard back in outside and we turn it on and it works fine And it gets to get signal after being rained on.

264
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:09,420
Rym: rained on multiple times.

265
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:16,880
Scott: So I've been trying to find a way to get rid of them and I found some electronics recycling places And but then none of them are really of one of them.

266
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,295
Scott: I called it the phone number and no one picked up like it didn't exist anymore.

267
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:20,858
Scott: It's like great.

268
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:23,880
Scott: The post office is gonna have a thing soon.

269
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,560
Scott: I think I talked about this before.

270
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:35,780
Scott: Where you go they have special envelopes and you put like an old cell phone in it or something and you met and you just Put it in the mailbox and for free they will take it someplace to be taken care of and that's cool.

271
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,600
Scott: But it doesn't work for a power supply even though it might work for say a CPU or a cell phone.

272
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:42,977
Scott: So what am I supposed to do with these power supplies?

273
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:46,407
Scott: Well Best buy might come to the rescue.

274
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:48,795
Scott: They've got this plan where right now.

275
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,120
Scott: It's only they're testing it out.

276
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,640
Scott: We're in like a hundred or so stores in specific areas like Baltimore and somewhere else.

277
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:58,126
Scott: I didn't check if we're on the list I don't know we're not yet and what they?

278
00:18:58,307 --> 00:19:02,560
Scott: there's a limit of two items per person per day or something like that.

279
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:21,731
Scott: So you just I get a whole bunch of people to come into the store like three people to get rid of six power supplies And they're gonna test to see if this program of them taking away, you know And recite recycling your old computer bits is a good idea for them because for them the benefit they get is they get you in The store, you know, and I'm sure also

280
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:27,793
Rym: it might work is the last time I went into a Best Buy I ended up buying some anime because that's really the best place to buy anime nowadays.

281
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:29,660
Scott: Yeah, except for Amazon.

282
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:31,386
Rym: Um, I don't know.

283
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:33,899
Rym: cuz Best Buy always has the crazy box set sales.

284
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,604
Scott: Amazon sells the box.

285
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:36,749
Scott: That's pretty much the same price.

286
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,882
Rym: Yeah, but I didn't see Eska flown a for 25.

287
00:19:39,882 --> 00:19:41,521
Scott: I think what it is $28.

288
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:44,172
Scott: I think what it is is that an Amazon you're not really like.

289
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:46,000
Scott: it's hard to think of all the anime.

290
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,060
Scott: So when you see them on the shelf, it's a lot easier to go all this show.

291
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:53,417
Scott: Oh, yeah I remember that but on Amazon you have to actually actively search for it in order to find out.

292
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:56,911
Rym: plus the last Few times I searched for a particular show on Amazon randomly.

293
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:58,216
Rym: They were still really expensive.

294
00:19:58,457 --> 00:19:59,280
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

295
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:03,092
Scott: So yeah, this this might be might be cool.

296
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:04,859
Scott: The thing is I'm questioning, right?

297
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:09,140
Scott: How do I know if I give them a working power supply to recycle?

298
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,780
Scott: Are they just gonna recycle it anyway?

299
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,137
Scott: Or are they gonna say hey this works and try to sell it or as an open box at the same time.

300
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:15,680
Rym: What do you care?

301
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,177
Rym: Well, cuz they're taking the burden onto themselves to deal with this thing.

302
00:20:20,277 --> 00:20:20,760
Scott: That's true.

303
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:29,900
Scott: However, the thing is why doesn't GameStop just say game recycling Give us your games to recycle and we would you know, it's it's you know.

304
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:32,560
Scott: And then they sell them to someone else and make money off.

305
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:38,820
Rym: well I think the the value of a game is much more long-term and useful and and apparent to the average person.

306
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:46,489
Rym: I mean think most of the people going to Best Buy are gonna bring their old broken computer or their broken LCD and then they're gonna buy a new LCD.

307
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:49,360
Rym: Best Buy is hoping that people like us don't come.

308
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,326
Scott: Yeah, that's another good point.

309
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:56,120
Scott: right if I show up with six power supplies, right that counts as six items.

310
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,660
Scott: What if someone shows up with a computer in a case that has a power supply and a motherboard and two hard drives in it?

311
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,539
Scott: That's actually like five items.

312
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,502
Rym: There's the front panel the back panel the side panel I know.

313
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:09,706
Rym: so so you know what you do.

314
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:13,297
Rym: the answer is you bring a case with six power supplies mounted.

315
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,866
Scott: Oh, yeah You got it.

316
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:17,193
Rym: So I'm getting rid of this computer.

317
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:18,479
Rym: I wonder if they'll even open it.

318
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:22,536
Scott: Yeah, I just have like three motherboards and like wow, this computer is really heavy.

319
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:22,917
Scott: Yeah.

320
00:21:22,938 --> 00:21:27,476
Rym: Yeah It's yeah, no, I got you know, SLI video cards.

321
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,560
Rym: I have an SLI motherboard.

322
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:33,480
Scott: Yeah, I mean I could get rid of these things and say Craigslist or eBay, especially the working ones.

323
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:35,059
Rym: Yeah, it's just so much.

324
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:41,220
Scott: It's just so much work to do that that it's not even worth it considering the problem how obsolete most.

325
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,640
Rym: Anytime we try to use Craigslist to not even to sell things but to give away things.

326
00:21:48,085 --> 00:22:00,960
Rym: The people who respond I don't know if they're stupid or what but they'll respond and say they basically either won't under like they don't even understand Apparently what it is you were giving away or they say yeah, I'd like it with no follow-up information.

327
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:02,750
Rym: And then they don't respond when you email them back.

328
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,620
Scott: Yeah, I'm like, alright, so, where do you want to meet?

329
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,401
Scott: I don't know.

330
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:06,264
Scott: Where do you want to meet?

331
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:07,709
Scott: It's up to you.

332
00:22:08,071 --> 00:22:09,696
Scott: You decide I'll be there.

333
00:22:09,716 --> 00:22:13,199
Scott: Oh No, we'll meet at this place at this time.

334
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:15,829
Scott: No reply, are you gonna show up there?

335
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,592
Scott: No reply.

336
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:18,700
Scott: Yeah, it's not worth that effort.

337
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,100
Scott: I'd rather just get rid of it then have to you know spend time dealing with these people now.

338
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,713
Rym: Is there any sort of limit on the size of things you like?

339
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:27,160
Rym: Could I roll a fridge over there?

340
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,864
Scott: I didn't see anything like that.

341
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:31,672
Scott: But Roy, I imagine a fridge might not be accepted.

342
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:32,896
Rym: Could I have taken the 1974 color RCA?

343
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,923
Scott: That's a good question.

344
00:22:35,984 --> 00:22:38,733
Scott: I think it's mostly targeted at like, you know digital cam.

345
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:39,636
Scott: Oh, yeah, like that.

346
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:40,820
Rym: What is their policy?

347
00:22:41,264 --> 00:22:41,769
Scott: I don't know.

348
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,780
Scott: it wasn't put there.

349
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,520
Scott: I'd have to go look into that but it would be interesting to see what the policy is.

350
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,088
Scott: You know, will they even take a power supply?

351
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,134
Rym: Yeah, will they take batteries?

352
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:50,180
Rym: Will they take electronics?

353
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,284
Rym: I ripped out of my car.

354
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,373
Scott: There really needs to be an easier way to get rid of this shit.

355
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:54,177
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

356
00:22:54,438 --> 00:23:04,040
Rym: Well, eventually, I think our society will get to the point where it'll be a lot like other recycling because one of the biggest problems with Recycling was that early on it took effort.

357
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:09,115
Rym: You had to split up the different Glasses and plastics and things and most people wouldn't bother and it was a giant pain.

358
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:10,320
Scott: Now they have a machine that does that.

359
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,185
Rym: Yes, and that alone.

360
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:15,635
Rym: how that machine any other activism got more people to recycle.

361
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:19,026
Rym: if you just I put it in a thing And someone else takes care of it.

362
00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:20,110
Rym: and that's the way it needs to be.

363
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,238
Rym: to get more people to recycle stuff like this.

364
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:30,879
Scott: and how The machine how recycling sorting machines work is way cool Like it's got magnets to pull the metal apart from the glass and then it's gets way cool way cool.

365
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:37,074
Rym: Anyway, so the FCC Probably my favorite government organization.

366
00:23:37,094 --> 00:23:37,917
Scott: Oh, they're fantastic.

367
00:23:37,978 --> 00:23:45,740
Rym: I love them But Despite all their problems they've decided now I'll get to the the rub if you will in this.

368
00:23:46,362 --> 00:24:02,280
Rym: they have decided that one thing they would like to do is take an unused piece of the 25 megahertz wireless spectrum and Auction it off such that whoever wins What must offer free internet access over that spectrum and in return like the rest of the spectrum?

369
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,385
Rym: That's associated with it.

370
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,313
Rym: They can use for whatever commercial business they want.

371
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:06,598
Scott: No, I'm liking that.

372
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,560
Scott: now The the thing is what quality of service they can offer.

373
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:15,017
Scott: Yes, we have giving you free one byte per second internet access.

374
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:15,780
Scott: Congratulations.

375
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:25,919
Rym: Well, the evidence behind this is partly that a lot of people are saying that it'll get broadband More it'll get more penetration in broadband markets, especially in rural areas and that sort of that is definitely needed.

376
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,919
Rym: Definitely have semi broadband out there.

377
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,010
Rym: But once again the rub here is that at the same time?

378
00:24:35,612 --> 00:24:44,729
Rym: Whoever offers this free internet must censor it and allow absolutely no obscene material to be Over those that can't be.

379
00:24:45,803 --> 00:24:48,898
Rym: now Why is the FCC still?

380
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:49,842
Rym: why don't they just give up?

381
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:51,610
Rym: Why do we still even try?

382
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,130
Scott: I mean, what is the law that the FCC uses to base?

383
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,592
Scott: You know the idea that it has the power to actually censor the call It does.

384
00:24:59,612 --> 00:25:00,556
Rym: the FCC is.

385
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:09,590
Rym: their mandate is to regulate the airwaves and it has been Accepted and assumed by the courts forever that that includes monitoring the the obscenity on the airwaves.

386
00:25:12,631 --> 00:25:26,887
Scott: The SEC's job should just be the technology of the airwaves and if they want to monitor any obscenity or perhaps You know people doing you know it to say the say the content of my radio broadcast is criminal Then the FBI should be all over that not the FCC.

387
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:30,390
Rym: Yes I mean, I'm definitely of the mind that the FCC should regulate the airwaves.

388
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:32,650
Rym: Otherwise the airwaves become yeah Cuz.

389
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:39,027
Scott: then I'll broadcast on FM 93.2 and Rimmel broadcast an FM 93.2 and it'll be totally useless.

390
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:48,210
Scott: cuz everyone in the cars were here and they will not be cool, but I Think you think oh we'll have a lot to say about this.

391
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,030
Rym: But what can I say other than that good God one it's impossible.

392
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:58,165
Rym: We already can't censor anything because there's no real definition of obscenity that works.

393
00:25:58,245 --> 00:26:03,129
Rym: and the legal definition of obscenity is Yeah, it's totally subjective.

394
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:08,182
Scott: Yep Plus, you know, how are they gonna any filtering mechanism?

395
00:26:08,222 --> 00:26:08,825
Scott: They come up with.

396
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:10,250
Scott: someone will find a way around it.

397
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:16,474
Rym: Well, the thing is even if they try to filter and even though you can't figure out how to filter and whatever, you know Everyone's different definition.

398
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:21,410
Scott: You're gonna filter out GeekNights because we say fuck sometimes but in a filter at the penny arcade.

399
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:29,093
Rym: Luckily, the interesting part is that all the carriers who are looking into these auctions pretty much said wow We're not gonna bid on that.

400
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:29,475
Rym: That's come.

401
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,726
Rym: Why would we even consider dealing with all that crap?

402
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:37,340
Scott: I see Yes, no one's gonna buy that spectrum if they're forced.

403
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:40,770
Scott: I mean someone might buy it, you know to offer free internet.

404
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:43,923
Scott: No one's gonna be willing to deal with all this censoring bullshit.

405
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:45,530
Rym: Well, who wants to put up with that?

406
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,457
Rym: Actually, this is the part that's kind of said.

407
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:52,357
Rym: now from what I've read the wireless carriers are not Avoiding it because of the censorship.

408
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:55,890
Rym: They're avoiding it because they don't want to have to offer the free part.

409
00:26:56,634 --> 00:26:59,130
Scott: Well, of course, they don't want to offer the free part either.

410
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:07,489
Rym: But I'm sure the winning bidder would also have to provide to build out the system to serve 50% of the US population within four years.

411
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:10,010
Scott: Yeah, that's that's quite an expense.

412
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,600
Scott: 95% within ten years that is.

413
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:24,390
Scott: that's crazy that even without the censorship that they have cost of Building up that kind of network far outweighs the value of pretty much giving someone the entire spectrum.

414
00:27:25,052 --> 00:27:32,618
Rym: Yeah, basically the issue here is that while there's the censorship part and the FCC once again stepping What I think is beyond the reasonable bounds of its power.

415
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:40,070
Rym: It doesn't matter because what they are asking for is technologically unfeasible impossible and unreasonable.

416
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:40,973
Scott: Mm-hmm.

417
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,709
Scott: I think I like how.

418
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:54,276
Scott: The part I like is just what they did with the other spectrum where they put in sort of clauses like you have to keep It open, you know and it's questions as to whether Verizon's actually doing what they're supposed to do But Google's on top of that.

419
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:56,245
Scott: So it's all good and you know where it's.

420
00:27:56,446 --> 00:27:57,190
Scott: you don't have to build.

421
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,710
Scott: They don't force you to build any particular kind of network.

422
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:06,550
Scott: They just said whatever you do You got to make sure that whatever you use that spectrum for you know, other people can get in on that, you know.

423
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:10,090
Scott: So I think we're gonna see some good stuff soon from that area.

424
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:22,339
Scott: So if you haven't noticed our voices have been going down sort of with this show.

425
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:29,124
Rym: Yeah, unlike conventions where we lose we expect to have our voices get hurt a little bit because we'll do you know Connecticut?

426
00:28:29,144 --> 00:28:30,796
Rym: I really want like 10 or 11 panels this year.

427
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:31,400
Rym: It's gonna be crazy.

428
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,196
Rym: And we always do like all these events we wreck ourselves, but it's expected.

429
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:46,440
Rym: but I always forget Whenever the front row crew gets together in any quantity We lose our voices because we spend the whole Weekend pretty much from when we wake up in the morning till we fall asleep talking loud.

430
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,208
Scott: I mean, I'm with a bunch of people.

431
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:57,280
Scott: I want to talk to all of them constantly Non-stop for three days and we happen to spend a lot of that time in a room with a lot of people also talking.

432
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,449
Scott: So you're gonna talk loudly.

433
00:28:58,469 --> 00:28:58,953
Rym: it's one.

434
00:28:58,973 --> 00:28:59,920
Rym: you're gonna lose the voice.

435
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:05,504
Rym: It was actually was really interesting because I remember in the early days of the FRC when we'd all be hanging out in like our colony apartment.

436
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:14,420
Rym: anyone who wasn't already kind of With or savvy to the way we were like they'd walk in and it was this wall of sound.

437
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,920
Rym: There are eight people gaga in a room and all of them are talking at the same time all the time and it never ends.

438
00:29:22,743 --> 00:29:28,385
Rym: It's kind of dwindle lately because we've got the smaller crew that lives in beacon and the smaller crew we play burning wheel with.

439
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:37,120
Rym: so we we see this group of people all the time and There are very few Controversial issues left and we all know everything going on in each other's lives.

440
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,300
Rym: So we don't have the wall of sound anymore, but suddenly new people every old story got told again.

441
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:47,325
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you haven't seen someone in two years Imagine how much you have to say to them.

442
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:51,560
Rym: a lot god, especially considering we have something weird happen to us pretty much every week.

443
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:54,109
Scott: Yep, you hear it all in the show.

444
00:29:54,169 --> 00:30:06,974
Rym: Anyway, right so things of the day I'll be short and sweet cuz we're going long and like I said my throat starting to go but I Like accordions and accordion music and if you have a problem with that you can die in a fire.

445
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:12,231
Rym: accordions are really cool instruments Yeah, and this guy if you don't believe that.

446
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,580
Rym: even if you don't like accordions watch this video.

447
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,319
Rym: It's one of those colleague humor videos, but it's a guy playing flight of the bumblebee.

448
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,942
Scott: Okay That's it.

449
00:30:23,002 --> 00:30:25,049
Rym: Was that your rendition of flight of the bumblebee?

450
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:28,400
Rym: Yes, I mean remember accordions are serious business.

451
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:32,897
Rym: You can play the melody and the chord harmonies Simultaneously and all.

452
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:43,620
Scott: yeah you have to cut and while you're doing that right you're playing what the Harmony with one hand the melody with the other hand and you have to move your arms back and forth the whole time.

453
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:45,152
Rym: Hey, it's easier than the bagpipes.

454
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:46,120
Rym: You gotta just keep blowing.

455
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:48,789
Scott: Well that bagpipes all about lung power.

456
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,680
Scott: the accordion has more coordination required than the bagpipe.

457
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:53,231
Rym: It depends on what you're playing.

458
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,985
Scott: But yeah, yeah I see, you know, you can't really.

459
00:30:56,025 --> 00:31:05,089
Scott: I never heard anyone play a bagpipe like did it, you know, it's usually like D You know Danny boy, whatever.

460
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:07,799
Scott: I don't even know how that song goes.

461
00:31:09,081 --> 00:31:10,145
Rym: I'm not even gonna try to sing.

462
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:11,168
Rym: Anyway, I sound.

463
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:13,475
Rym: I sound like one of those smokers.

464
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:14,418
Rym: It's what?

465
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:15,960
Scott: yeah No, you're not.

466
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:19,600
Rym: Wow, I think I know why smokers talk that way.

467
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,338
Rym: It actually is easier to talk like this than to talk in my normal voice right now.

468
00:31:24,523 --> 00:31:24,906
Scott: Not really.

469
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:25,248
Scott: Okay.

470
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:35,020
Scott: Anyway, so OpenOffice if it it's kind of taking a backseat lately because we have things like, you know, Google Docs and such.

471
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:37,240
Scott: But OpenOffice still has a place in the world.

472
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:47,600
Scott: I mean if you need a full office suite with you know The full office applications the spreadsheet the word processor all that business and you don't want to pay the ludicrous price for Microsoft Office.

473
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,179
Scott: OpenOffice is pretty much the only viable choice, you know.

474
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:56,880
Scott: But it has its problems in terms of performance in terms of sort of crummy user interface, right?

475
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,610
Scott: So I found this thing it's called like red office.

476
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:01,695
Scott: I think I don't remember.

477
00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:03,000
Scott: it's the computers in the other room.

478
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:05,970
Scott: I have a Remembering what a website I looked at.

479
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,960
Scott: Where's your laptop in the other room?

480
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:15,356
Scott: anyway And basically what this is just OpenOffice with a replacement user interface.

481
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:18,025
Scott: That's far superior According to the screenshots.

482
00:32:18,065 --> 00:32:18,566
Scott: I looked at.

483
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:31,950
Scott: so if you like OpenOffice and you want a free office suite To install on your computer, but you hate the OpenOffice user interface because it sucks and it does suck This looks like a good alternative.

484
00:32:32,011 --> 00:32:32,492
Scott: Why not?

485
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:34,520
Scott: So check out this story.

486
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:37,420
Scott: This story gave us the idea of what to talk about today.

487
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,088
Scott: So, you know the the dig guys right.

488
00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:43,900
Scott: they have their revision 3 company which sort of does all their video podcasts?

489
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:49,229
Scott: you know the dig nation the Tekzilla Control all chicken.

490
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:50,540
Scott: I don't know if they still do that one.

491
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,640
Scott: They got a bunch of TV video shows over there, right and they want to deliver those TV shows.

492
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:57,320
Scott: They put some of them on bit torrent.

493
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,993
Scott: So if you want to get dignity with bit torrent you can.

494
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:01,239
Scott: and they have a bit torrent server.

495
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:04,120
Scott: There's a company out there called media defender.

496
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:11,980
Scott: Media defender is a company that is paid for by the evil record companies and I think I'm safe and saying evil now.

497
00:33:12,922 --> 00:33:23,167
Scott: And what media defender does is they go out looking for bit torrent servers that are serving up, you know illegal copyrighted content by the record companies.

498
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:34,460
Scott: and when they find those servers dishing up illegal content they Attack them with like hacks and DD OS's like to bring down the bit torrent servers.

499
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:40,540
Scott: It's basically vigilante justice in a way only so much the justice and a whole lot of the vigilante.

500
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:49,096
Rym: Yeah I mean they'll basically flood bit torrent networks with bad and spurious information to prevent anyone from downloading from them and hopefully to bring down The actual trackers and everything.

501
00:33:49,197 --> 00:33:57,040
Scott: Yep So of course media defenders sent some packets over to the revision 3 bit torrent server to say hey what's going on over here?

502
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:04,969
Scott: you know, we want to see if there's any illegal bit torrents on this bit torrent server and Revision 3 because it's run by smart tech.

503
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:09,641
Scott: people saw these packets coming from this media defender and they're like what the fuck is This shit.

504
00:34:10,043 --> 00:34:11,108
Scott: so they blocked that shit.

505
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:16,226
Scott: So media defender was like, oh Someone is trying to block our shit.

506
00:34:16,446 --> 00:34:17,870
Rym: They must be evil pie.

507
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,094
Scott: They must be evil pirates.

508
00:34:19,534 --> 00:34:27,667
Scott: So basically media defender Launched a You know denial of service attack against revision threes bit torrent server.

509
00:34:27,726 --> 00:34:37,716
Scott: a perfectly legitimate company with a perfectly legitimate bit torrent server was attacked by this other company in the name of evil and vigilante justice.

510
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:39,120
Rym: now this.

511
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:45,120
Rym: The idea of this sort of thing has always been a very controversial issue even among white hats.

512
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,388
Rym: Just the idea that all right, like.

513
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:48,150
Rym: here's an example.

514
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,393
Rym: There's the problem out there.

515
00:34:49,455 --> 00:35:03,720
Rym: This is a little bit of a stretch But where there'll be zombie networks and bad computers spewing out spam and all this sort of thing or a worm that makes people spam Bots, what if a good hacker makes a bot that goes around or a worm that goes around?

516
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,920
Rym: Attacking or getting rid of bad computers and cleaning up the internet?

517
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:10,488
Rym: Yeah, and they're the.

518
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:14,700
Rym: the battle lines are pretty much 50/50 on either side of whether or not that's ethical.

519
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:20,400
Scott: But yeah, it's sort of like if I go around and I force everyone to get tetanus shots.

520
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,153
Scott: You know, I am doing a good thing.

521
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:24,500
Scott: There is no question about that.

522
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,420
Scott: I'm pretty much eliminating tetanus from the human population.

523
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,893
Rym: But at the same time 1% of people are allergic to the vaccine and die.

524
00:35:31,054 --> 00:35:32,720
Scott: Okay, but forget the allergic.

525
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:39,749
Rym: No But it's the same parallel because if you even if you write a good white hat worm One percent of the computers out there gonna get totally hosed by it.

526
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:40,793
Scott: That is true.

527
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:41,615
Scott: That is true.

528
00:35:41,796 --> 00:35:47,560
Scott: And in addition to that You know, you're sort of infringing them on people's freedom to do with their computer what they want.

529
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,849
Scott: You know, why is stealing wrong?

530
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,500
Scott: because you're not respecting someone's right to property.

531
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:57,320
Scott: So someone else doesn't respect a third party's right to property.

532
00:35:57,842 --> 00:36:01,074
Scott: So you fix it by not respecting a right to property.

533
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:02,540
Scott: It's like punching someone who punched you.

534
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:04,707
Scott: You know, you're just you're stupid at their level.

535
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,613
Scott: So should you do it or not?

536
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:08,660
Scott: Who knows we're working on that one.

537
00:36:09,363 --> 00:36:12,678
Scott: But anyway, well this gave us the idea to talk about.

538
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:19,600
Scott: you know The ever-famous denial of service attack which is quite popular and off discussed on the Internet.

539
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,177
Scott: So most people don't really understand what a denial of service attack is.

540
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:32,630
Rym: now if you hold out We're not going to talk about the actual revision 3-3 because there's a lot more news going on about that And we're pretty much you can get that anywhere on the internet.

541
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,520
Rym: We're gonna wait until there's kind of some sort of response.

542
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:42,700
Rym: I mean, I know the FBI is investigating it and we're not sure what's going to happen but Media defender basically broke the law.

543
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,820
Rym: It's just a question of whether or not the law is going to actually apply to them or not.

544
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:58,398
Rym: Yep, but as for a denial of service attack a denial of service Basically all it means it's exactly what it sounds like Of service you deny someone their service.

545
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:05,267
Scott: Yep So if someone's serving something say a web page and they want to serve others They want to serve the web page to other people.

546
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:09,940
Rym: say someone has a service like their private computer that happens to be connected to the internet.

547
00:37:10,302 --> 00:37:13,320
Rym: You would you do something to deny them access to their own computer?

548
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:22,812
Scott: Yep, pretty much any service anything that a computer does you deny that you say, haha It's like it's like going to someone's house and turning off their TV.

549
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:24,740
Scott: You're denying them their television, you know.

550
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,998
Scott: And that's what a denial of service attack is there many many many ways to do it.

551
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:33,173
Scott: The most popular way is usually by flooding them with so much shit.

552
00:37:33,193 --> 00:37:33,855
Scott: They can't handle it.

553
00:37:34,558 --> 00:37:41,436
Scott: For example Let's say I got a little web server, right and it's not so strong it's a little web server.

554
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:42,299
Scott: that could you know.

555
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:52,091
Scott: and I put up a funny picture on that web server and you go to the website and you see the funny picture and you go Hahaha, but someone else sees the funny picture and they go.

556
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:53,175
Scott: Hey, I don't like that picture.

557
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:54,459
Scott: I don't want this picture getting out.

558
00:37:55,103 --> 00:38:02,335
Scott: so what they do is they find by some method they Request that picture like thousands and thousands of times.

559
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:02,978
Scott: They give me the picture.

560
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:07,394
Scott: Give me the picture And because it's only the little web server that could it goes.

561
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:08,097
Scott: here's the picture.

562
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:08,578
Scott: Here's the picture.

563
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:09,020
Scott: is the picture?

564
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:10,260
Scott: Oh my god, stop asking.

565
00:38:10,361 --> 00:38:17,400
Scott: It's like imagine if you're at a counter at McDonald's and you're you know Serving out the burgers and like a thousand people cram into the store and they all want Big Macs.

566
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,233
Scott: It's like ah, ah, I can't give Big Macs to any of you.

567
00:38:20,274 --> 00:38:20,796
Scott: There's too many.

568
00:38:20,856 --> 00:38:21,500
Scott: I can't handle it.

569
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:28,460
Rym: Now the actual the way I mean the the technical details of denial of service attacks would probably warrant an entire separate show.

570
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,964
Rym: I mean they actually.

571
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:44,220
Rym: they range from the very simple just in the olden days of I write a script that pings you a million Times I send a sin flood Which is just a. I send you a million sin packets TCP wise trying to get you to open all those connections.

572
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,103
Rym: you know our sessions.

573
00:38:45,786 --> 00:39:08,052
Rym: and then there are the much more kind of complicated ones like say I send a bunch of fragmentary TCP IP packets with overlapping gigantic payloads and As a result because of the way I craft the data either inject bad code or just hang up your computer use up all your Memory, maybe just lock up all your sockets.

574
00:39:08,072 --> 00:39:09,779
Rym: You can't actually use your internet anymore.

575
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:20,732
Scott: Yeah, there's quite a number of attack vectors when it comes to denial of service But a lot of people actually when it comes to denial of service They always talk about the DD OS.

576
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:26,980
Scott: not just do s but D Do s and that's sort of like a become a colloquial term in a way, but they're not the same thing.

577
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:34,800
Scott: No, a DD OS actually is a distributed denial of service Which is a very which is much more specific than denial of service.

578
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:44,960
Rym: This is also the more common kind of attack nowadays because all these attacks and spam and a lot of things They don't come from like the one evil computer out there and Soviet Russia.

579
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:51,835
Scott: Yeah If I do a sin flood say from my computer to rims computer When it's all cleared up because it will be cleared up eventually.

580
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:52,900
Scott: I can't keep it going forever.

581
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,710
Scott: You know, he's gonna say hey all these sin pack.

582
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,087
Scott: is it coming from Scott, haha, hey Scott Hey Scott, please are on their way.

583
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:00,870
Scott: I see my fist.

584
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:02,175
Scott: You see your face.

585
00:40:02,255 --> 00:40:03,420
Scott: They're like two meeting.

586
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:06,598
Rym: Yes, if I do s you in the house, I think you'll.

587
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:06,920
Rym: course.

588
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:19,029
Rym: I think my do s would be I just unplug your your cable from the switch I would go flick the circuit breaker and then break the switch off so you couldn't flick it back or I would just go administrative Administratively disable your port on the switch.

589
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:21,039
Rym: No, that would take you a while to figure out.

590
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:36,311
Scott: Yeah, at least a couple minutes, yeah anyway a distributed denial of service is when you get a whole bunch of computers all over the place to do a little bit each at The same time so you can't defend against against that as easily.

591
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:38,777
Rym: cuz alright an attack comes in from one computer.

592
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,533
Rym: I just Route that port to a null somewhere.

593
00:40:42,593 --> 00:40:45,879
Rym: I block it and then I'm done I'm safe and I still can use my network.

594
00:40:46,422 --> 00:40:56,080
Rym: But if the attacks are coming from effectively random IP addresses all around the world I can block them by blocking the entire world and thus I have just denied myself my own service.

595
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:12,560
Scott: Yep, what's even worse is that a lot of these distributed denial-of-service attacks, but there were there are ways to defend against them but what ends up happening is because it's so difficult to you know determine the difference between illegitimate requests for service and legitimate requests for service.

596
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,549
Rym: I mean is my web server being attacked?

597
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:16,740
Rym: or did penny arcade just linked to me, right?

598
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:22,955
Scott: I mean if penny arcade links to you You're gonna have people from all over the world Asking for your web page and on the network level.

599
00:41:22,995 --> 00:41:31,584
Scott: if you look at the packets That's what it's gonna look like if someone sets up a zombie network around the world of zombie windows 98 machines And they all ask for your web page.

600
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:37,413
Scott: How can you tell the difference between that and You getting linked to on slashdot or penny arcade.

601
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,780
Scott: There's no way to tell the difference.

602
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:49,191
Scott: So any defense that would solve the DDoS would also defend against getting linked to on penny arcade and being popular Which is not something you want to defend against.

603
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:57,240
Rym: in a well-designed network though or a well-designed server There are ways to defend against most kinds of DDoS attacks in a way that won't deny that sort of thing.

604
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,360
Scott: I mean well because there are defining characteristics of DDoS attacks, but you also just have to be clever.

605
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,120
Rym: I mean most of you out there probably use IP tables and some well.

606
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:10,420
Rym: I guess most of you who are actually technically proficient with Linux know about IP tables or maybe IP chains and all these things.

607
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:16,039
Rym: But if you're clever you can use hash tables and IP tables and you can set up rules such as

608
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:16,824
Scott: If

609
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:30,860
Rym: I receive more than 10,000 packets in a minute that are incoming new connections from this range of IP addresses Then I want to throttle those such connections and log that something bad might be happening.

610
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:31,422
Scott: yep,

611
00:42:31,743 --> 00:42:55,283
Rym: and all sorts of you can write very complicated rules that will effectively protect you or at least Say you're gonna get hit like say, you know Your computer can only handle so many requests you set of rules like that to kind of Throttle it as demand increases to where instead of your server crashing or going down You just not everyone gets in all at once and you kind of at least some people will be able to get in instead of No one can get in

612
00:42:55,724 --> 00:42:58,393
Scott: also depending on the service that you're offering.

613
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:06,740
Scott: like if you're offering a web service, you know This is web pages There are a lot of things you can do on that higher level above the networking level to defend against an attack.

614
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:13,094
Scott: for example if you might see in the The the user strings of you know, all these web requests.

615
00:43:13,114 --> 00:43:15,343
Scott: Hey, these are all Windows 98 machines You can just be like.

616
00:43:15,383 --> 00:43:17,051
Scott: hey, no Windows 98 machines right now.

617
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:19,160
Scott: I can obviously tell there's a virus going down.

618
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,839
Scott: You know, this doesn't look like a normal traffic pattern because I'd be seeing a lot more.

619
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:27,099
Scott: you know Vista and XP machines if this was normal traffic is obviously a virus.

620
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,300
Scott: or You can like have your work here.

621
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:37,644
Scott: If you have a blog that's dynamically generated and because it's dynamically generating the page every time someone visits You're getting bogged down.

622
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:41,016
Scott: so you can have some sort of mechanism that caches the web page.

623
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:42,040
Scott: traffic is high.

624
00:43:42,181 --> 00:43:42,945
Rym: Actually what you do you?

625
00:43:43,025 --> 00:43:43,267
Rym: if you?

626
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:45,198
Rym: I mean usually you should have some sort of caching.

627
00:43:45,298 --> 00:43:49,000
Scott: anyway You should but you can like get rid of images when traffic is high.

628
00:43:49,261 --> 00:43:54,120
Rym: What you do is you use the hash tables and have the hash tables kick off scripts that do this.

629
00:43:54,140 --> 00:44:02,919
Rym: So say your website is dynamic because you have a lot of dynamic content and if requests exceed a certain amount It replaces your page with a static page until it goes down.

630
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:06,153
Rym: But the other the real tricky part is a lot of people.

631
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:07,700
Rym: they they get halfway there.

632
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,199
Rym: They don't think they're clever plan all the way through and they set up rules like that.

633
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:17,797
Rym: The problem is if you set up these rules incorrectly, you'll basically end up do s in yourself.

634
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:27,646
Rym: Let's say I I'm clever and I say alright any to any packet beyond the 10,000th packet in a given amount of time From any given port or whatever.

635
00:44:28,509 --> 00:44:31,559
Rym: I want to not let that pack it in and I want to log it.

636
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:41,180
Rym: That just means if you get do est you're now going to eat up all your system I/o logging all those do s packets when you should just be dropping them.

637
00:44:41,441 --> 00:44:46,900
Scott: Yep, or you might even let's say let's say you don't even do you know logging to the disk, right?

638
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,201
Scott: You do.

639
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:49,480
Scott: we have a separate like syslog ng server.

640
00:44:49,961 --> 00:44:57,148
Scott: Well now you got a problem of network slow down and if that logging server is not at a back land Your networks in a slow down even more.

641
00:44:57,189 --> 00:44:59,540
Scott: you might be dropping packets before they even get to the NIC.

642
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,725
Scott: Could be bad news.

643
00:45:01,026 --> 00:45:03,637
Rym: Yeah, it's actually it's a pretty complicated issue.

644
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:03,918
Rym: I don't know.

645
00:45:04,961 --> 00:45:09,753
Rym: We should probably do separate shows on one how do s attacks actually work?

646
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:12,440
Rym: and then another one probably on like basic computer defense.

647
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:23,473
Scott: Yeah, you know my company we have a problem with this because there was you know, there's some sort of like weird You know, we can't even tell if they're attacks, you know, but it's like hey There's a bunch of traffic coming from China to this one machine.

648
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:23,996
Scott: What the fuck?

649
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:24,840
Scott: You know, I don't know.

650
00:45:25,001 --> 00:45:25,685
Scott: Is it attack?

651
00:45:25,947 --> 00:45:27,094
Scott: Is there anyone we hate in China?

652
00:45:27,114 --> 00:45:33,329
Rym: I don't get it The easiest way with a small company To figure out what's going on.

653
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:39,354
Rym: if you especially with internal servers as opposed to web servers Just turn it off and see who calls.

654
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:40,520
Rym: Yeah, I did.

655
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,513
Rym: Yeah, I don't know how many times I did that at IBM were like the hell.

656
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:44,980
Rym: did this server do where to come from?

657
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,162
Scott: I don't know.

658
00:45:46,182 --> 00:45:47,406
Rym: unplug the network cable immediately.

659
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:51,480
Rym: My phone rings and and I pretty much say are you calling about of something?

660
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,708
Rym: He says yeah, my DNS server went down.

661
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:57,040
Rym: Well, you shouldn't be running your DNS server off of this box.

662
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:05,580
Scott: Yeah, but like our company we have one machine that sort of does this like ping post web service thing.

663
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:13,713
Scott: So basically other companies that you don't have accounts with us are constantly sending and receiving like XML to and from this machine all the time.

664
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:27,740
Scott: a lot of it like constantly and If someone attacks that machine, you know through that service It's really hard because it's like hey, are they just making a lot of legitimate requests or are they destroying us?

665
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:30,052
Rym: All right, so you're getting this XML.

666
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:31,863
Rym: you might think oh Well, maybe you should.

667
00:46:31,883 --> 00:46:43,039
Rym: will write rules and the XML handlers that look at the data and you know Like with web forms you can write things that pretty trivially can tell Like a spam filter if it's legitimate data or not.

668
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:51,660
Rym: Yeah like on a forum like you just look to see if Usernames have more than eight or nine consecutive consonants and things like that or numbers and all that sort of stuff.

669
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,378
Scott: But now since we're checking we're doing this test to every XML thing that comes in.

670
00:46:57,001 --> 00:47:00,820
Scott: It's eating up the CPU because they're doing all these extra tests to see what's valid and what's not.

671
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:06,780
Rym: Yeah, I mean the higher layer you try to do this checking on the more you're setting yourself up to be screwed

672
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:17,100
Scott: Yep, but on the lower layer you have less information with which to determine what's legitimate and what's not legitimate And it's much more difficult to actually do the filtering.

673
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:22,477
Scott: So it's yeah, it's a big problem all around at least for defending for attacking.

674
00:47:22,517 --> 00:47:23,240
Scott: It's quite easy.

675
00:47:23,643 --> 00:47:27,200
Rym: Yes attacking is easy and fun Pretty much.

676
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:34,749
Scott: all you do is get a lot of computers all around the world put a virus on them and have some sort of controlling software and Then just type in someone's IP address and put

677
00:47:34,909 --> 00:47:50,021
Rym: the real problem that so many computers are out there now And so many people are so technologically behind that I think a lot of people Don't realize that their computers are spam bots and that their computer is slow because it's sending spam out 24/7.

678
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:56,064
Scott: Yeah, they just they just saw my computer slow time to get a new one sort of like, you know They think of it like a car.

679
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:58,432
Rym: so so they'll take their computer back to Best Buy.

680
00:47:58,873 --> 00:48:06,115
Rym: Best Buy will take their computer for free Sell it to someone else after you know taking the spyware off and then they'll sell them a new computer.

681
00:48:06,657 --> 00:48:07,580
Scott: That's fantastic.

682
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:13,040
Rym: Ah, I think we'll end on this because frankly we're one while we're doing the new format.

683
00:48:13,381 --> 00:48:19,406
Rym: Like I said, we didn't get kind of the rest period before so this is kind of like a nor The last normal episode of GeekNights.

684
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:21,914
Scott: Yeah, and we're not gonna do a show tomorrow.

685
00:48:22,074 --> 00:48:24,803
Scott: No show tomorrow none Zero.

686
00:48:24,964 --> 00:48:25,245
Scott: Yes.

687
00:48:25,526 --> 00:48:29,358
Rym: Also, I'm really hungry and I really I think one of the upcoming Mondays.

688
00:48:29,398 --> 00:48:29,860
Rym: Let us know.

689
00:48:30,462 --> 00:48:39,432
Rym: do you want to hear about the technical details of DOS and DDoS attacks or Do you want to hear about the practicalities of defending against them?

690
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:42,160
Rym: Mmm, either one I think would be an interesting topic.

691
00:48:42,343 --> 00:48:43,459
Scott: Yeah, I think those are good.

692
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:44,844
Scott: I'm liking sort of like the.

693
00:48:44,884 --> 00:48:53,656
Scott: I think people in general are interested in the hacking and defending from hacking topics because Even if they're not, you know actually interested in them, it's like ooh hacking sort of.

694
00:48:53,677 --> 00:48:56,126
Scott: has this mystique You know, we'd like to hear about.

695
00:48:56,246 --> 00:48:57,209
Rym: actually maybe we should do.

696
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,561
Rym: there's a third Monday option now hacking mystique We get.

697
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:02,426
Rym: well, there's a fourth Monday option now.

698
00:49:02,988 --> 00:49:09,045
Rym: We could talk about what's like cyber warfare on the technical level Like what it really is.

699
00:49:09,065 --> 00:49:09,967
Rym: Hmm.

700
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:10,389
Scott: That's good.

701
00:49:10,669 --> 00:49:14,440
Rym: But I think right now I'm gonna talk about a chimney and maybe some chimichangas.

702
00:49:21,985 --> 00:49:24,167
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

703
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:26,768
Rym: special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

704
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:38,776
Scott: be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes links our awesome forum a link to our frapper math and Links to all the RSS feeds.

705
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:44,914
Rym: we say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different Brands of geekery.

706
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,583
Rym: Mondays are science and technology Tuesdays.

707
00:49:47,623 --> 00:49:49,630
Rym: We have video games board games and RPGs.

708
00:49:50,092 --> 00:49:55,510
Rym: Wednesdays are anime manga comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

709
00:49:55,951 --> 00:50:07,610
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to GeekNights at front row crew comm or you can send audio feedback via Audio, just click the link that says send me an audio on the right side of our website.

710
00:50:07,953 --> 00:50:13,100
Rym: If you like what you hear you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

711
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:16,430
