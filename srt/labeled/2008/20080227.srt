1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,349
Scott: It's Wednesday, February 27th.

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,292
Rym: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,055
Scott: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:15,440
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,940
Scott: Tonight, we begin Katsu-Kan coverage.

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,908
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,430
Rym: Now I know a lot of people are listening to GeekNights right now.

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,010
Rym: You're listening to this episode expecting some Katsu-Kan coverage.

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,089
Rym: And we're going to have that for you.

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,030
Rym: But I know a lot of you are probably new GeekNights listeners.

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,390
Rym: You've never listened to this stuff before.

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,649
Rym: You're just, you were at Katsu-Kan, you saw us, you were waiting for us to do the thing we'd say we do.

13
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:48,950
Rym: Maybe you skipped those other episodes earlier in the week because you really only care about anime.

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,652
Rym: Well, here it is.

15
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:53,890
Rym: This is GeekNights Wednesdays, the night when we talk about anime, manga, and comics.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:03,950
Scott: Seriously, though, if this is like, if you were waiting to listen to GeekNights until this episode came out, like, you discovered it's like, how many episodes do we already have you could have listened to?

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,024
Scott: Why didn't you go and listen to one of those old ones?

18
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:08,190
Scott: What, seriously?

19
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,070
Rym: Yeah, I don't think we need to explain what GeekNights is or how it works.

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,606
Scott: Well, if you're already hearing this, you've already figured it out.

21
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:15,290
Scott: Congratulations.

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,270
Rym: Well, they might not have figured out that we air four nights a week and we cover four different topics.

23
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,521
Scott: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

24
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,470
Scott: They can read that on the website.

25
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:26,166
Rym: But now's the part where normally we start, we talk about our day like, "Hey, Scott, how you

26
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:26,427
Rym: doing?".

27
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:28,426
Rym: "Uh, uh, blah, blah, blah, flat

28
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:28,689
Rym: tire.".

29
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:30,289
Rym: "Hey, well, blah, blah, blah, crazy homeless

30
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:30,370
Rym: guy.".

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,099
Scott: Actually, lately I'm feeling a lot better.

32
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,770
Scott: Like, the sun was coming into the office today and I was, I felt like working and I did work and, uh...

33
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:38,607
Rym: Oh, yeah, well, I got my new laptop, so...

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,810
Scott: The winter's almost over, my gears are connecting again.

35
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:51,870
Rym: I walk outside, it's warm, I take the Express 4 train down to Union Square, go to the bag store, look at bags, go right back to work and order one of the bags I saw online for less money.

36
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,810
Scott: Did you buy that one bag that you said you liked?

37
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,449
Rym: No, actually, I didn't actually purchase yet, but I filled my cart with two bags and I got to pick one of the two.

38
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,810
Scott: I'm not a fan of that bag.

39
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,350
Rym: I like that bag a lot.

40
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,849
Scott: I'll demonstrate to you after the show how the, uh...

41
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,854
Rym: No, I know exactly how it works.

42
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:12,008
Rym: The thing is, with that bag, it really, really goes with my duster, like in a big way.

43
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:16,169
Scott: Oh, do you need a purse to match your shoes?

44
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,690
Rym: No, because I'm getting that bag.

45
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,260
Scott: Oh, tables turned.

46
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:20,230
Scott: Tables turned.

47
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,305
Scott: Oh, Rym was shopping for a purse at the store.

48
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:24,210
Scott: I had to wait for him.

49
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:26,243
Rym: Actually, it will match my shoes.

50
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:27,090
Rym: That was kind of important.

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,717
Scott: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:29,340
Scott: Okay.

53
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:31,390
Scott: I'm glad we cleared this up.

54
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:32,149
Rym: Cleared what up?

55
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,190
Scott: Why you took so long to buy a bag.

56
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:43,050
Rym: Actually, I bought my bag immediately, unlike someone else we know who might be in this studio here, who, uh, when we were trying to get to the beach after being at Wildwood...

57
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,264
Scott: Spent time in the video game store as opposed to the bag, shoe, and such store.

58
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,130
Rym: Went to the mall trying to buy a pair of shoes to match his purse.

59
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,269
Scott: Yeah, Rym buying his cosmetics and his...

60
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,909
Rym: You mean my Cosmo Coie.

61
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,129
Scott: His perfumes.

62
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,328
Rym: Anyway, anyway.

63
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,210
Rym: So, uh, now's the time when we talk about our day, but I gotta skip that because every now and then there's...

64
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,590
Scott: Today was not an exciting day.

65
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:08,469
Rym: No, it was not.

66
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:14,649
Scott: I mean, the most exciting thing I might have to say today is that Rym got some more ramens, but he got them yesterday and they're still in his car.

67
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:25,349
Rym: Yeah, and I got a lot of exciting stories from the last week and a half where we didn't do GeekNights, but those are all big enough to be actual kind of anecdotes as opposed to just, "Yeah, yesterday, blah, crazy homeless

68
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:25,549
Rym: guy.".

69
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,529
Scott: I got some... Oh, actually, no.

70
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:35,050
Scott: When I got off the train when I got home and I walked up the stairs, did you take the stairs out of the train station?

71
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:36,109
Rym: I did take the stairs.

72
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:38,010
Scott: Did you notice anything on those stairs?

73
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:40,430
Rym: I noticed something scary that I avoided.

74
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,019
Scott: You did see it.

75
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,010
Scott: It was there that long.

76
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,010
Rym: I didn't know what it was, and I had a couple of guesses as to what it was.

77
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,821
Scott: A couple of guesses.

78
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,250
Scott: What is your number one guess?

79
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,247
Rym: It's doo-doo!

80
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:54,210
Scott: It was a big doo-doo in a brown paper bag.

81
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,210
Rym: Are you sure it wasn't just like a big chocolate donut that someone dropped?

82
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:00,489
Scott: I am so sure that was poop.

83
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,702
Rym: Because I didn't inspect it.

84
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:03,610
Rym: I decided.

85
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,656
Rym: I walked by it pretty quickly.

86
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:10,250
Scott: I didn't smell it, but I am confident that it was the shit of something.

87
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,288
Rym: You know, sometimes something happens, and you're like, "I gotta go see what that was or it'll haunt me the rest of my

88
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:14,509
Rym: life.".

89
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:16,663
Rym: I saw it as I was walking up.

90
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:17,449
Rym: My brain was saying...

91
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:21,490
Scott: Well, I was walking up, and the person in front of me, for no reason, dodged to the left.

92
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,728
Scott: So I looked down to see what they dodged to the left from, and it was a really giant, giant poop.

93
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:28,550
Scott: That's all I can say.

94
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:29,054
Rym: Sure.

95
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:30,329
Rym: It might have just been a donut.

96
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:33,206
Scott: It could have been a donut, but I'm giving a 90% chance of poop.

97
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,590
Rym: See, my brain was calculating, because you know when you're walking, your brain's always calculating stuff.

98
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,906
Rym: Like, you're in the parking lot, and it's like, "Is that my

99
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,228
Rym: car?".

100
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:41,538
Rym: There's an 80% chance.

101
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:42,163
Rym: that's my car.

102
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:43,050
Rym: Yep, it's my car.

103
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:46,250
Scott: I actually have a new trick for finding my car at night in the parking lot.

104
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,178
Rym: Remembering where you park it?

105
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,410
Rym: Setting off the car alarm?

106
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,130
Scott: No, I push the unlock button on my keys.

107
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,721
Rym: And it goes, "Boop,

108
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:51,926
Rym: boop.".

109
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:56,650
Scott: No, and it turns on the lights, so I can see the lights reflecting off the cement in the dark.

110
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,970
Rym: I just popped my trunk because it sounds like a gun going off.

111
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,929
Scott: Yeah, I don't have a trunk popper because I have a hatch.

112
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,773
Rym: But, uh, my brain started to calculate what that was, and it said to me, "All right, Rym.

113
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:11,090
Rym: I've done some calculations, and if it's okay with you, I'd just like to stop right

114
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,170
Rym: now.".

115
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,662
Scott: Whenever it was, don't step in it.

116
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:13,590
Scott: That's all that matters.

117
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,428
Rym: My brain said, "Let's just keep walking, and hopefully we'll forget about

118
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:16,609
Rym: this.".

119
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:19,262
Rym: And I did forget about it until you brought it up here.

120
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:20,730
Rym: Yeah, that's doo-doo.

121
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:22,630
Scott: That was doo-doo in the train station.

122
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,090
Rym: Anyway, instead of talking about my day and the doo-doo, I got something.

123
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,181
Rym: I got to talk about this because it's rare.

124
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:30,146
Rym: I mean, I read Fark.

125
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:30,830
Rym: I'm a Farker.

126
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:35,490
Rym: I used to post on Fark on an hourly basis back when I was in college.

127
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,205
Rym: Now, I post maybe on a weekly basis.

128
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:39,090
Rym: I don't really post anymore.

129
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,938
Rym: I don't have time for that shit.

130
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:40,928
Rym: I have a real job now.

131
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:46,370
Rym: But every now and then, I come across a headline that makes me laugh.

132
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,570
Rym: And every now and then, one of those headlines that makes me laugh causes me to read the article.

133
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,370
Rym: And every now and then, the article is just one of those articles.

134
00:05:54,752 --> 00:05:56,343
Rym: And this is beyond Thing of the Day.

135
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:57,289
Rym: I got to talk about this.

136
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:03,650
Scott: I think this might be Darwin Award material, depending on if the subject has reproduced.

137
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,510
Rym: When I was young, I often didn't wear a seatbelt, usually because I'm a good driver.

138
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,910
Rym: And I was driving very short distances with no traffic and broadband.

139
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,530
Scott: I wear a seatbelt if I'm driving out of the driveway into the street.

140
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:22,730
Rym: Pretty much, though, now, because I live in places where roads curve, and there's deer and stuff, I wear a seatbelt no matter what, because something can happen.

141
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:26,526
Rym: But there are people who, you know, there's laws in New York.

142
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:27,450
Rym: You have to wear a seatbelt.

143
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,291
Rym: A lot of places in this country, in the world now, have laws where if you don't wear a seatbelt, you can get pulled over.

144
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:40,286
Rym: Well, this gentleman was pulled over not once, not twice, but 32 times since February of 2003 for refusing to wear a seatbelt.

145
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:45,622
Rym: Now, normally, there are two courses of action.

146
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:47,330
Rym: Course of action number one is...

147
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,530
Scott: Didn't they suspend his license after a point, just that you can't drive anymore?

148
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:52,280
Rym: No, because it's not a moving violation.

149
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:53,810
Rym: They probably just kept giving him big tickets.

150
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:56,245
Rym: I think there's nothing wrong with that.

151
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:56,690
Rym: It's alright.

152
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:08,465
Rym: His courses of action were either continue to give the big ol' finger to the police, and pay, well, the finger being keep pulling out his wallet and paying for these tickets, or, I don't know, start wearing his goddamn seatbelt.

153
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:09,250
Rym: There's a pattern here.

154
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,810
Scott: Well, there's an option of don't pay the ticket.

155
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:12,276
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

156
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:14,530
Rym: That option, that's a road you don't want to go down.

157
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:21,010
Rym: So, no, he chose not the corners, not the straightaways, but the third path.

158
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:32,750
Rym: This gentleman made an intricate, fake seatbelt that would lay over his shoulder, so a cop, it would look like he was wearing a seatbelt, but in fact, he was not.

159
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:34,586
Scott: Okay.

160
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,150
Rym: Now, usually the reason people don't wear seatbelts...

161
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,130
Scott: Wouldn't it have been a lot easier just to wear the seatbelt?

162
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,290
Rym: Well, remember, there are two reasons people don't wear seatbelts.

163
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:46,029
Rym: Reason the first is that they're just lazy, and reason the second is that they're fat.

164
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:46,251
Scott: Lazy?

165
00:07:46,493 --> 00:07:48,509
Scott: It's hard for me not to put the seatbelt on.

166
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:58,810
Rym: There was actually an article recently about how there's an inverse relationship between people's weight and their likelihood of wearing seatbelts, because the seatbelts are uncomfortable if you're really fat.

167
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:10,790
Rym: But this guy was not really fat, and if he's lazy, I'm surprised he went through the effort of making a somewhat intricate system of bullying people into thinking that he was wearing a seatbelt.

168
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:14,803
Scott: Your explanation of there are only two reasons why people don't wear seatbelts is wrong.

169
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:16,670
Scott: There must be other reasons people don't wear them.

170
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:25,550
Rym: Well, regardless, the story was on FARC, so obviously a police officer discovered his cunning plan, and you might imagine...

171
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,782
Scott: Well, you gotta think, if we're telling you that he had a fake seatbelt, they must have found out he had a fake seatbelt.

172
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:34,070
Scott: If he got away with it, we wouldn't have a news story about it, would we?

173
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,870
Rym: No one who's ever seen a bun yup live to tell about it, but they look like this.

174
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:40,657
Rym: Oh, well, how do we know they look like that?

175
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:42,323
Rym: How do you know what a cockatrice looks like?

176
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:43,890
Rym: How do you know it just looks like some short dude?

177
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,661
Scott: How do you know what the medusa looks like?

178
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:48,230
Scott: How do you know that it's got snakes for hair?

179
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,670
Rym: Well, you can see the medusa from the back, you just can't look in the eye.

180
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,549
Scott: Yeah, but how do you, you know, you watch, like, Clash of the Titans, and you see...

181
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:57,046
Rym: Or, you know what, if you make your fucking saving throw...

182
00:08:57,772 --> 00:08:59,130
Scott: I guess, but the saving throw...

183
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,010
Rym: Saving throw against gaze attacks, nonetheless.

184
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:02,650
Rym: Or was it petrification?

185
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:05,929
Scott: Perseus couldn't even make the fucking saving throw, he had to use the mirror trick.

186
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:18,950
Rym: Mirror trick sucks, that's like minus eight to hit, but anyway... So, uh, now I imagine the hilarious conversation between this gentleman and the police officer who discovered his fake seatbelt, but actually, no.

187
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,050
Rym: This gentleman, um, I'm just gonna read a sentence from the article.

188
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:30,887
Rym: Quote, "His fatal injuries were caused when he was thrown forward onto the steering wheel in a low-impact

189
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:31,388
Rym: crash.".

190
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:39,290
Scott: Wear your seatbelt, even if you're driving, like, down your street to your friend's house, not even on any major roads.

191
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:54,190
Rym: So, dude gets pulled over thirty times for not wearing a seatbelt, makes an intricate device to fake wearing a seatbelt, and then, not too long after, is killed in an accident, where it is clear, according to the coroner, that he would have survived with no injuries, had he been wearing a seatbelt.

192
00:09:56,054 --> 00:10:01,050
Rym: Uh, I think it's sad, but I'll admit that I laughed out loud when I read this article.

193
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:05,449
Scott: It's sad that someone dies, always, but...

194
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,450
Rym: Um, he was also a meth addict, just to add some, uh...

195
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:15,810
Scott: That explains a lot there, but, yeah, this is like the least sad death, I think, in the history of the world.

196
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,450
Rym: Nah, Hitler.

197
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,707
Scott: Okay, but...

198
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,930
Rym: Secondly, sad death.

199
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,790
Scott: It's, you know, it's one of the least sad deaths.

200
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,285
Rym: Actually, I gotta say, I finally learned the exact story of how Robespierre met his end, and...

201
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:32,229
Scott: Robespierre was a jolly fellow.

202
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,270
Rym: Robespierre was probably one of the most pissed off people in the history of pissed off people.

203
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,090
Rym: Good God, did that guy not die with dignity.

204
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:46,090
Scott: I think if Robespierre was alive today, with his level of pissed offness, he would have been a stand-up comedian, and then killed himself.

205
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,100
Rym: You know, Louis Black, Robespierre.

206
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:49,590
Rym: Yeah, I can kinda see it.

207
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,468
Scott: That's what I'm telling you.

208
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,889
Rym: Except, but anyway... Louis Black didn't kill himself, yet.

209
00:10:55,073 --> 00:11:00,490
Rym: This isn't, you know, regular radio, this is gig night, so I think that's the end of me talking about that stuff.

210
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,129
Rym: So, uh, anime time?

211
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:05,550
Scott: I think it is anime time, 'cause it's definitely not comics time.

212
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:06,768
Rym: Alright, so what's up?

213
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,910
Scott: Alright, so, remember how it was like the end of the world, and in terms of American anime, right?

214
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:16,170
Scott: We're less time on Anime in the USA.

215
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,290
Rym: Anime in the US, going under.

216
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:25,450
Scott: ADV had some problems, legal problems, contractual problems with, what, Sojits, or whatever that company is.

217
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:37,627
Scott: You know, the company that helped them get licenses, and they lost licenses to a bunch of shows, and all kinds of stuff was going on, and people were glooming and dooming, saying, "Ah, the anime industry in the US is dead, no one's buying

218
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:37,908
Scott: DVDs.".

219
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,990
Rym: And that is all kinda true, I mean, we're not gonna say, "Oh, the anime industry is fixed," but, uh, it's starting to come back.

220
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:59,770
Scott: No, but remember how, when that news was also happening, one of the things we said, you know, there seems to be a consensus that, you know, there are many problems and things going on, but two contributing things are, one, looking at that list of ADV things that got canceled, right?

221
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:10,110
Scott: Most of those are things that nobody cared about, and maybe one or two of them were things we cared about, pretty much five centimeters per second, and Project Blue Cheeky SOS, right?

222
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:16,870
Rym: Project Blue Cheeky SOS, much like Baccano, is one of those shows that has the potential to be one of those shows.

223
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,534
Scott: Yep.

224
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:25,374
Scott: And looking at the list, even ones I didn't care about, you know, I could tell that one's gonna be profitable, that one's not gonna be, et cetera, et cetera, right?

225
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:29,705
Scott: Well, some of them have been saved.

226
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:31,610
Scott: ADV managed to save some shows.

227
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:40,370
Rym: Now, because you have not immediately attempted to kill yourself, I'm assuming that there is good news with Project Blue Cheeky SOS.

228
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,842
Scott: Oh, it couldn't be better news.

229
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:42,510
Scott: Look at this, right?

230
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:53,447
Rym: I think it could be better news, because the best news is ADV has already translated it, and they're driving toward our house now with DVDs on gold platters, that they're then going to show to us.

231
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,734
Scott: There could be better news, but this is the news.

232
00:12:56,936 --> 00:13:03,810
Scott: Here are the new ship dates for things that were previously cancelled by ADV but are now not cancelled.

233
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,014
Scott: All right, you ready?

234
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:08,890
Scott: Shipping on March 18th, Moonlight Mile #2.

235
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:17,890
Rym: Ah, you know, Moonlight Mile, despite the sheer amount of sex that was unexpected, was actually a pretty good show.

236
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:27,310
Scott: Yup, shipping on, you know, March 4th, 5 centimeters per second, Canon Volume 3, Amagata 6, Red Garden 4, whatever.

237
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,074
Scott: Shipping on March 11th, Venus vs.

238
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:45,405
Scott: Virus 3, I'm not gonna read the whole list, all that's important is shipping on March 11th, Project Blue Earth SOS 2, and shipping yesterday, Project Blue Earth SOS 1, yesterday, as in the day before.

239
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:51,510
Scott: right now, as in probably two days ago, because most of you are gonna be listening to this on Thursday, not Wednesday when I'm recording it.

240
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,324
Scott: Project Blue Earth SOS is probably in Best Buy right now.

241
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:56,649
Scott: You can go get it.

242
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:06,010
Scott: You can go on Amazon right now and click Add to Cart with one click, and it will probably be at your house early next week, if not Saturday.

243
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:07,994
Scott: I suggest you do so.

244
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:18,520
Scott: Now, the thing is, it's actually, I'm gonna have a tough time, right, because they obviously haven't learned from their mistake of "Why are you releasing all these individual DVDs?

245
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,649
Scott: Just put the box of the whole show out and fuck everything

246
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:20,870
Scott: else.".

247
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,574
Scott: They haven't learned that lesson yet, right?

248
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:28,709
Scott: But, Project Blue Earth SOS is a weird one in that it's really not too many episodes.

249
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,195
Scott: It's not like a 26 episode show.

250
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,870
Rym: I would definitely be willing to buy it one episode per DVD.

251
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:38,630
Scott: It's an OAV, and the first episode is like 45 minutes long, and there aren't too many of them.

252
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,579
Scott: So, should I go out and buy disc one that came out yesterday?

253
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:47,590
Scott: I mean, if disc two is gonna come out March 11th, that's pretty soon.

254
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,516
Scott: That's like a few weeks, less than a month.

255
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:53,410
Scott: So, maybe I should go that route on this particular show.

256
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:59,150
Scott: That might be the way to, you know, because it's such a good show, and I've only seen one episode, and I liked it so much.

257
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:06,150
Scott: And also, if episode two sucks, I can just sort of stop and not continue buying the other episodes if episode two's no good.

258
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,614
Scott: That might be a good idea, I think.

259
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:09,656
Scott: We'll see.

260
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:15,030
Scott: But, everyone should buy the first disc, because that's worth having, even if you don't need to see the rest.

261
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,392
Scott: So, yeah.

262
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,524
Scott: ADV, they managed to save the important show.

263
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,910
Scott: I don't really care about anything else.

264
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:27,890
Rym: So, in equally important anime news, I'm not gonna dwell on these, because we're gonna wait for a lot more information to come out, and then we'll probably just do a show about this business.

265
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:37,230
Rym: But, there are two important anime that are gonna be coming out, eventually, in Japan, and I assume the US, because these are shows that did awesomely in the US.

266
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:45,150
Rym: First off, it looks like, according to the rapper cover of the final volume of the Trigun manga...

267
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,454
Scott: Okay, wait, it's up right there.

268
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:50,008
Scott: First of all, thank God that fucker is over.

269
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:50,670
Scott: God damn.

270
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,014
Rym: Are you still reading that?

271
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:55,230
Rym: Because I like, I mean, the Trigun anime was amazing.

272
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,696
Scott: The Trigun anime is amazing.

273
00:15:56,776 --> 00:16:00,490
Scott: If you don't realize, I say this every time it comes up, but I have to say it every time it comes up.

274
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:01,910
Rym: This is like top five anime ever.

275
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,781
Scott: I have to say this every time it comes up, even though I'm repeating myself.

276
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:08,310
Scott: The Trigun manga is bad.

277
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,112
Rym: Well, no, no, no.

278
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:09,915
Rym: I wouldn't say bad.

279
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,188
Rym: I would say messed up is the proper...

280
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,891
Scott: Terrible.

281
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:20,066
Scott: Okay, well, actually, the first is two volumes, the gold and the silver volumes, Trigun 1 and Trigun 2.

282
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,530
Scott: Those are actually okay.

283
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,857
Scott: They're average manga.

284
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,890
Scott: If you really like Trigun, get those.

285
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:29,150
Scott: Trigun Maximum is just terrible and screwed up and crazy batches.

286
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,095
Rym: I wouldn't say it's terrible.

287
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,810
Rym: The only problem with the Trigun manga...

288
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,714
Scott: It makes no sense.

289
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:36,490
Rym: It's incomprehensible, just random shit.

290
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,492
Rym: You can read a page.

291
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:45,290
Rym: You will turn the page and read the next page, and you will not be able to figure out exactly what happened between these two pages.

292
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:51,608
Rym: Or, in fact, you could probably take every fifth page out and just move some pages around.

293
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:52,330
Rym: I don't think anyone would notice.

294
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,190
Scott: I think they just scramble up the pages is what I think.

295
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,299
Rym: Yashuhiro Naito is a madman.

296
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,264
Scott: Yashuhiro Naito.

297
00:16:57,325 --> 00:16:58,109
Scott: It's not Yashuhiro.

298
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,403
Scott: Yashuhiro is a madman.

299
00:17:00,423 --> 00:17:01,250
Scott: Yes, he is a madman.

300
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,780
Scott: But anyway, I have volume 12 in English, right?

301
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,290
Scott: And I knew there was a 13th volume, right?

302
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,377
Scott: And I'm thinking, well, this has to be pretty much like the end, right?

303
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:13,467
Scott: And then knowing 14 is the end is like, "Ah, good

304
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:13,808
Scott: God.".

305
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,560
Rym: But this movie is one of those straight-up movies.

306
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:20,967
Rym: They don't even really have a title or anything yet.

307
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:22,832
Rym: It's gonna come out in 2009.

308
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:30,830
Rym: But the Tri-Gun movie is going to be a completely original story from Naito and Nishimura, who did the original Tri-Gun anime.

309
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:36,830
Rym: And if this happens, this is gonna be so badass.

310
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,110
Scott: Hey, from what I read, because Tri-Gun movie has been a rumor for a long time, right?

311
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:50,350
Scott: And I've been thinking recently there's been a definite lack of anime movies that aren't Pokemon, Naruto, One Piece movies, you know?

312
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,996
Scott: So this is really good news on that front.

313
00:17:53,116 --> 00:18:04,101
Scott: And in addition, it seems like, from what I've read, this tiny bit of information that all we have to go on is that they have the right idea and we're not gonna base this on the manga or the anime.

314
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:12,430
Scott: We're just gonna take the characters people like and the universe and we're gonna make over an hour of animation that will entertain.

315
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:26,710
Rym: Now, the other thing is that they've got the right people on board here because we've seen the situation where a popular thing Tengi Muyo is taken over by different people who suck and the series just kind of goes downhill in a bad way.

316
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,450
Scott: Wasn't it already at the bottom of the hill?

317
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,990
Rym: Tengi Muyo was a pretty good show when it came out.

318
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:33,009
Scott: All Tengi Muyo sucks, all of it.

319
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:33,848
Rym: You suck.

320
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:34,289
Scott: You suck.

321
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:39,770
Rym: The original Tengi OAV Ryo Oki and the first Tengi movie are absolutely amazing.

322
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,770
Scott: Why is the original OAV named after the cute animal creature that's the sidekick?

323
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,450
Rym: Maybe you should watch it and find out.

324
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,710
Scott: Maybe I shouldn't because it's terrible.

325
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:49,610
Rym: I don't get your problem.

326
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:51,110
Scott: Harem shows.

327
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,761
Rym: Yeah, the first harem show.

328
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:53,709
Rym: The best harem show.

329
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,270
Scott: Okay, that's like saying the least smelly poop in the train station.

330
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,993
Rym: Let me put it this way.

331
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:06,330
Rym: Just like slice of life shows, there's a lot of genres or types of shows that are maligned, but independently there are shows in those genres that can be good.

332
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,029
Rym: I think the early Tengi Muyo was actually pretty good.

333
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,530
Scott: Alright, name a good moe.

334
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:15,870
Rym: I could argue that Lucky Star is pretty good.

335
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:17,504
Scott: I don't think it's a moe show.

336
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:18,230
Scott: I think it's a comedy.

337
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,910
Rym: Yeah, but it's got those elements.

338
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,280
Scott: I think it's in the same genre as Genji Ken.

339
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,990
Scott: It just has a different art style.

340
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:26,990
Rym: Anyway, I'm not going to get into this now.

341
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:28,638
Rym: You're dumb.

342
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:29,650
Rym: Tengi's pretty good.

343
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,486
Rym: But also, they're going to make another Slayer.

344
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,034
Scott: Oh yeah.

345
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:37,230
Scott: I vote Naga the Serpent only.

346
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:38,192
Rym: What?

347
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:41,050
Rym: No, the good Slayers was the original TV show.

348
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,070
Rym: The OAV, you know, most of the OAVs were not actually that good.

349
00:19:45,438 --> 00:19:45,888
Rym: Quiet, you.

350
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,490
Rym: And the manga, not so great.

351
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,190
Scott: Every Slayer's OAV, golden.

352
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,350
Scott: Manga I haven't read.

353
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,289
Rym: Have you seen all of the OAVs?

354
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,350
Scott: The vast majority of them, and every one I have seen, classic.

355
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,970
Rym: I don't think they live up to even the shadow of the original TV series.

356
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,370
Scott: The original TV series is pretty good, but OAVs, that's where it's at.

357
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:07,150
Scott: That's where you get the high comedy, non-stop, hard-hitting action.

358
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,209
Scott: The regular original TV series actually had some seriousness and some fantasy plot going on.

359
00:20:12,651 --> 00:20:15,050
Rym: Yeah, as did the Slayer's motion picture.

360
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:17,870
Scott: As it did as well, yes, which is also awesome.

361
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,869
Rym: Which, yes, but I think that was better than every OAV.

362
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,489
Scott: Maybe, but Naga the Serpent was in it.

363
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,096
Rym: Yes.

364
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,387
Rym: Ah, you see.

365
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,989
Rym: And it had a different tone from every other OAV.

366
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,301
Rym: It was almost completely different.

367
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:30,310
Rym: It was like a third path.

368
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:35,430
Scott: Even so, the Slayers where Naga the Serpent is present are superior to the ones where she is not.

369
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,329
Rym: Again, I couldn't disagree more.

370
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:42,510
Rym: As far as I'm concerned, the original Slayers is such a funny, good show.

371
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:43,610
Scott: I didn't say it wasn't.

372
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,710
Rym: Plus, you haven't even seen the rest of Slayers.

373
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:48,950
Scott: I haven't seen The Next or The Tribe, but I saw The Slayers.

374
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:55,090
Rym: You realize that Next gets less serious, more funny, crazier, and then Try is even crazier still?

375
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,870
Scott: Well, I know about the Claire Bibble action, and I didn't say it's bad.

376
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,730
Rym: You only know about the Claire Bibble, because I talk about it all the time.

377
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:04,150
Rym: I reference the Claire Bibble more often than I master it.

378
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,130
Scott: Claire Bibble's pretty funny.

379
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:05,475
Scott: It is.

380
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:07,769
Rym: You really need to see.

381
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,528
Rym: Anyway, regardless, I'm not going to get into this, but the important parts...

382
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,129
Scott: I'm sabotaging your news.

383
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:23,110
Rym: The important parts here are that, unlike other franchises, it looks like Slayers has got Watanabe on board and the original studio to pretty much just...

384
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,006
Scott: Shichiro Watanabe?

385
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,289
Rym: Takashi Watanabe.

386
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,590
Scott: Okay, I was going to say.

387
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:30,709
Rym: And it looks like they're not going to fuck this up.

388
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,850
Scott: Yeah, I don't see how you really could.

389
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,409
Rym: Oh, you could.

390
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:42,610
Scott: Well, I guess they could, but they haven't made a bad Slayers yet, even, you know, whether you think... You know, I think all Slayers is great, even though I, like, you know...

391
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,810
Rym: Well, I'll say this, a lot of people thought that the second half of Slayers Try really kind of went downhill.

392
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,410
Rym: I kind of agree, but they tried to get too serious and also too crazy.

393
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:59,630
Rym: It was kind of like the gravitation at this problem, too, where, like, the rollercoaster of funny serious funny serious got way too tall.

394
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,143
Scott: Derailed.

395
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:01,990
Rym: No, just way too tall.

396
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:05,270
Rym: Like, wow, that's a scene so sad I'm going to cry.

397
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,870
Rym: Wow, Lina just blew up and in, and then a talking pig, and then something crazy happened.

398
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,270
Scott: Okay, okay, but I guess that may or may not be true.

399
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:22,070
Scott: Regardless, there have been a... Of all the Slayers that has ever been made, a very small percentage of it is not good.

400
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:25,290
Scott: So, making more, good chance of being high quality.

401
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,910
Rym: Now, if you've never seen the original Slayers TV series, your homework is to go out and get it.

402
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:30,242
Scott: That is anime history.

403
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:33,570
Scott: If you need it convincing, we did an episode on it.

404
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,849
Rym: Not only that, I just want, I'll point out one more time.

405
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:42,930
Rym: Slayers, the original Slayers is a show where when the heroes confront the bad villain who is going to do the dark ritual to release the big...

406
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,309
Scott: This is your favorite thing in the world.

407
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:44,886
Scott: The big badness.

408
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:46,729
Rym: All right, what does he do?

409
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:48,118
Rym: He says, "Oh, you're

410
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:48,320
Rym: here.".

411
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,889
Rym: Ah, runs away, locks the door, does the ritual as fast as he can.

412
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,653
Scott: Yep.

413
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:54,609
Scott: And finishes.

414
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:55,330
Scott: Yep.

415
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:57,610
Rym: That is what I'm talking about right there.

416
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:07,330
Scott: I mean, in any other show, it would have been like the good guys come in, they talk to him, they disrupt the ritual, you know, but then he manages to pull the ritual off anyway because the bad guys are dumb.

417
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,050
Rym: But also, this happens pretty early on and there's a lot more stuff.

418
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,690
Rym: Also, I think it was the first show where someone ever took one of those sweat bubbles and tried to kill someone else with it.

419
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:15,489
Scott: Yeah, it was good.

420
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,939
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

421
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,820
Rym: Penny Arcade readers are probably aware of this, as are dig people, but in case you're not or you missed it or you just read the comic but not the rants, I gotta talk about this.

422
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:46,680
Rym: A while ago, we talked about the random Garfield comic strip generator, which just takes three random Garfield panels and prove that randomly assembled Garfields are funnier than anything Jim Davis ever wrote in his sad, sorry life.

423
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,260
Scott: Oh my god, random Garfields are so awesome.

424
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,700
Rym: Well, we have found something, the internet has found something that takes that to the nth degree.

425
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:14,060
Rym: This is Garfield minus Garfield and what I've learned from this is that if you take Garfield comics, god I'm laughing just looking at these again, and just remove Garfield but leave John in, they move from this level of not funny to a level of hilarity that I almost can't help cracking up looking at these.

426
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:24,380
Scott: I liked him, especially that one with the pants, that was the best of the bunch, but I still get more laughs out of the random Garfield.

427
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,480
Scott: The thing is, the random Garfield can be hit or miss, but when it's a hit, it's a much bigger hit than this.

428
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,740
Rym: You know what, I patently disagree.

429
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,612
Rym: The random Garfield generator is okay.

430
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:45,737
Rym: I mean, it's kind of funny, it's usually miss, you really have to go for a while to get a hit, but removing Garfield from Garfield is such comedy gold.

431
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:47,480
Rym: I mean, the second to last one.

432
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,340
Scott: I think it's comedy silver or bronze.

433
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,541
Rym: This is comedy gold.

434
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:58,191
Rym: The second to last one, it's John standing there and he's looking down with his slanty eyed "there's something wrong with my pants".

435
00:24:58,612 --> 00:25:04,580
Rym: and then a panel of him not doing anything and he's still looking down at his pants, you can imply that he's looking at some sort of member.

436
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:09,960
Rym: And then his eyes go wide and that's the end and I cannot express to you how funny this is.

437
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:12,399
Scott: It's a pretty funny one right there, it's the best of them.

438
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,640
Rym: I don't know, I think the implied suicide in the second one is also really good.

439
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,259
Scott: That's okay.

440
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,509
Rym: And the fervor with which he is reading the newspaper in the first one.

441
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,360
Rym: This is comedy gold and Scott has proven his lack of taste.

442
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:24,854
Scott: Anyway.

443
00:25:25,421 --> 00:25:26,180
Rym: Alright, so what do you got for me?

444
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:34,756
Scott: So because I haven't been internetting as much as I used to, I mean, I can't, I haven't gone to Google Reader, it's probably got like a 10,000 video game newses and 10,000 regular newses, I have no idea.

445
00:25:34,756 --> 00:25:37,938
Rym: 10,000 power curry.

446
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:44,020
Scott: Actually, let me go to it right now and I'll tell you just how many video game newses I have not read.

447
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:45,008
Rym: Oh, just be on with it.

448
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:46,620
Rym: People are waiting for us to talk about Katsucon.

449
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,827
Scott: It just says 1,000 plus because it's gone over the edge.

450
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,916
Scott: Anyway, so because of that, I didn't have a news.

451
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:55,300
Scott: So where do I go?

452
00:25:56,941 --> 00:26:00,800
Scott: Japanese television, the source of infinite things of the day, of course.

453
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:03,850
Scott: Basically what we have here is there was a product.

454
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,200
Scott: I can't tell if this is a legitimate product or a joke.

455
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:15,720
Scott: I think it's legitimate and the product amounts to pretty much just a gold pla- a gold painted plastic bucket thing, right?

456
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:24,720
Scott: And in each commercial you have these really excited people show you the bucket and then they give you two uses for the bucket thing.

457
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:31,880
Scott: And like in the first commercial, like someone uses it as a stool and then someone else uses it as like a little tiny bookshelf on their desk.

458
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:37,260
Scott: And the second one, a guy uses an armrest and a lady uses it as a vase.

459
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:46,980
Scott: And it's like they- it's just a video and they keep showing you more and more commercials and in every commercial you got two more uses for this crazy bucket thing.

460
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:52,551
Scott: And actually, you know, wow, this bucket is pretty useful.

461
00:26:52,851 --> 00:26:57,180
Scott: Of course, some of them are- they're pretty- they're stretching it with the uses of the bucket thing.

462
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,930
Scott: But yeah, it's good, funny commercial stuff from Japan.

463
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,140
Scott: You might want to fast forward through it a bit, but it's worth watching, I guess.

464
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,798
Rym: Alright, anyway.

465
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:08,958
Scott: KatsuKan.

466
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,821
Rym: KatsuKan 14.

467
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:14,908
Scott: Actually, KatsuKan 14 is weird because I can sum this up real quick.

468
00:27:14,988 --> 00:27:21,940
Scott: I was sick most of the con, but I could tell from my experience when I was out and about, even though I was sick, that the con was super awesome.

469
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:26,740
Scott: But I don't have much to say because I would spend most of my time in a hotel room in bed.

470
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,550
Rym: And sadly, because Scott was sick, I had to pretty much do double duty.

471
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,280
Rym: because, you know, when we're at cons, kind of like when you do the show, there are things that I do and things that Scott does.

472
00:27:36,681 --> 00:27:37,884
Rym: And we kind of like- the duties are split.

473
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:44,700
Rym: Like, if you look at the credits of Geeknot, just like, "Rym, producer, Scott, web admin," and we- like, everything's split up.

474
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,980
Rym: And at cons, like, we do all this duty, but I pretty much had to do all of the con bullshit.

475
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:50,300
Scott: You had to do my duties.

476
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:51,720
Scott: I had to do the duties.

477
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:53,300
Scott: Was that what you left the train station?

478
00:27:53,582 --> 00:27:53,976
Scott: That's doo-doo!

479
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:07,160
Rym: So, as a result, my view of KatsuCon was more- you know, we've talked about this a lot, actually, in other reviews of cons, how there's kind of a- you know, most people go to cons and they only have one view.

480
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:14,160
Rym: The view of the con goer, like the kid or the mom or the someone who goes to the con to enjoy themselves and go to a con and do all the con stuff.

481
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:21,400
Rym: But there's all these other kind of ways to experience the con or perspectives on the conventions that are completely different.

482
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,540
Rym: I mean, if you're a dealer, your con looks- feels completely different.

483
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:35,080
Rym: If you're a staffer, if you're a gopher, if you're the press, if you're the entertainment, all these things, all these ways to experience the con are kind of interesting.

484
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,300
Rym: I kind of want to do a long-running series on getting people who have each one of these perspectives and just interviewing them about it.

485
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:45,280
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's like you have an event, but there are many different hats that you could wear at this event.

486
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,420
Scott: You could be the con chair, you could be, you know, everything Rym just said.

487
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,500
Scott: And for each of those people, the same event is a different experience.

488
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,248
Scott: It's like you go to a sporting event, right?

489
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,980
Scott: And the majority of the people there are spectators.

490
00:28:58,161 --> 00:28:59,590
Scott: But what's the sporting-?

491
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,340
Scott: what's the Super Bowl like for the camera guy?

492
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,891
Scott: What's the Super Bowl like for the player?

493
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:04,140
Scott: What's the Super Bowl like for the coach?

494
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,339
Scott: What's the Super Bowl like for the owner, you know?

495
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,060
Rym: I mean, think about the simple change in perspective.

496
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:12,340
Rym: A lot of people experience this, you know, in your high school, college, whatever, you got to give a presentation.

497
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:17,520
Rym: You're so used to sitting at your desk or wherever you sit and, like, you've got this view.

498
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:23,420
Rym: And a lot of times you're taking notes, you're playing your Game Boy or whatever, and you feel, you know, like you're safe.

499
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:30,820
Rym: Like, no one's really- but then you actually have to present something or you do something and you get up to the front of the room and you stand where the professor normally stands.

500
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:36,200
Rym: And the room looks totally different and you realize, like, this totally different perspective on everything.

501
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:38,680
Rym: And for conventions, at that time, it's a billion.

502
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:39,844
Scott: Yep.

503
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,700
Scott: All right, let's talk about what happened to Katsu-kun.

504
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,160
Rym: Yep, well, this Katsu-kun, as a result, we only have one perspective.

505
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,780
Rym: Now, actually, probably next week or whenever we get a chance, I'm going to try to get some of our friends who were at this con.

506
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,700
Rym: We'll talk about this a bit because a lot of them got a lot of different perspectives.

507
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,680
Rym: And I think we're going to have to do a separate coverage of Katsu-kun from everyone else's perspective.

508
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,600
Scott: You want to try that?

509
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,698
Rym: Yeah, we definitely have to.

510
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,939
Scott: We could definitely kill some episodes off that way.

511
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,040
Rym: Because we have exactly one perspective of this con, and that is entertainment, staff, and nothing more.

512
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:11,480
Rym: Yes.

513
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,678
Rym: I didn't do jack or shit at Katsu-kun.

514
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:21,440
Rym: I spent the whole time doing GeekNights stuff, preparing GeekNights stuff, announcing stuff in the video game room, running tournaments, fetching things.

515
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,579
Scott: Your orange juice is getting warm.

516
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,140
Rym: Hiding in the con suite.

517
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,580
Scott: Yeah, but basically, you know, at Katsu-kun, the last time we were there, there was mad video game room action.

518
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,719
Scott: And basically, this time...

519
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,580
Rym: Well, because last year, we were invited to kind of be, like, guest staff at Katsu-kun by video Katsu.

520
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,939
Scott: Yeah, we're technically staff.

521
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:40,100
Rym: Yes, now we are, like, full on staff.

522
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,479
Rym: But that time, we were, like, video game staff.

523
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:47,000
Rym: And they didn't really make us do anything, and we only had, like, two panels to do.

524
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:55,540
Scott: Yeah, we have a weird status at Katsu-kun, in which we're staff, but no one's our boss, even though technically, I guess, the video game room is our boss.

525
00:30:55,641 --> 00:30:57,260
Scott: But they don't boss us around.

526
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,880
Scott: We sort of do as we please, and people try to please us, but we're staff.

527
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,750
Rym: That's because we're weird.

528
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:12,960
Rym: It's like at New York Anime Festival, we were guests, and we're kind of straddling that line now, where conventions give us, like, conventions actually give us things that are unexpected.

529
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:13,988
Scott: Yeah.

530
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:14,272
Scott: Anyway...

531
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,880
Rym: But Katsu-kun, like, and I think the funniest thing was that we brought our own personal staff this year.

532
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,200
Rym: Like, we brought the front row crew, our staff, to take care of business for us.

533
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,560
Rym: We had roadies, we had everything.

534
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:30,700
Scott: And... All we really needed was Pete to help us carry the stuff.

535
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:34,298
Rym: Well, we used them in the video game room, because actually, Pete and Katsu...

536
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,311
Scott: Well, we didn't use them in the video game room.

537
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:37,660
Scott: The video game room used him.

538
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,643
Rym: We foisted them off.

539
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:43,339
Rym: We said, "All right, you guys are going to be staff for the video game room to take care of all the stuff that we would have taken care of last

540
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:43,520
Rym: year.".

541
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,400
Rym: You know, running tournaments, all that stuff.

542
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,793
Rym: But they don't really have to do anything.

543
00:31:48,813 --> 00:31:50,240
Rym: They could have gotten away with doing nothing.

544
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:57,360
Rym: But I think they've realized that there's something about being just that one step beyond, like, just past that velvet rope.

545
00:31:57,802 --> 00:32:02,760
Rym: They actually spent the majority of their Katsu-Kan being staff and actually doing work.

546
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,220
Scott: Well, I mean, look at... If I was Pete or Katsu in that position, I would have done the same thing, right?

547
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,431
Scott: You're at this convention, okay?

548
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,400
Scott: You've been to anime conventions before, lots of them.

549
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:13,641
Rym: You've been to, like, 20.

550
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:17,320
Scott: And, you know, the things that go on at the conventions are not too exciting for you.

551
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,780
Scott: There were no real, like, events that were, like, you know, really exciting for them, right?

552
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:24,079
Scott: You go to the dealer's room once or twice, right?

553
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:29,196
Scott: All your friends are either sick in bed, running events, or an artist's alley.

554
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:30,540
Scott: Maybe you can go to your friends' events.

555
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,500
Rym: Yeah, I mean, God, I didn't get to hang out with any of my friends at Katsu-Kan, except, like, I ran away.

556
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,769
Scott: I said basically hi to everyone once.

557
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:40,139
Scott: Like, I said hi to Ananth once, hi to Nuri once.

558
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,717
Scott: You know, it was just like, "Hi, hi, hi, hi, I'm sick, hi, I'm

559
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:42,838
Scott: sick.".

560
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,400
Rym: The only moment of respite I got in the entire con was Saturday night.

561
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:46,879
Scott: Respite.

562
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,799
Rym: It's respite.

563
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:54,540
Rym: After all our business was done was I took Ananth and one of our listeners and Nuri.

564
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,020
Rym: I actually forget the listener's name, but you were totally cool.

565
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,379
Rym: There's a reason I bought you a drink instead of blowing you off.

566
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:04,920
Rym: And we got drinks, and we hid in the bar, and we actually had a conversation.

567
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:06,119
Scott: Oh, my God.

568
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:06,980
Rym: It was crazy.

569
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:09,049
Scott: But, yeah, you're in that position.

570
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,700
Scott: where what are you going to do with this con?

571
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,900
Scott: You know, you have a staff badge, but no one can boss you around.

572
00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:15,219
Rym: Well, they could if they wanted to.

573
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,600
Scott: They could, but they don't, right?

574
00:33:16,882 --> 00:33:19,160
Scott: You're in the video game room, I guess, nominally.

575
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:22,615
Scott: You play a bunch of video games, and then you just go like,

576
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:22,896
Scott: "Huh?".

577
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,399
Scott: And someone comes up to you, and they say, "Hey, do you want to

578
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:27,600
Scott: work?".

579
00:33:28,561 --> 00:33:29,733
Scott: And it's like, "Huh, I

580
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:30,056
Scott: could.".

581
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:32,659
Scott: This is Pete's words I'm taking here, you know.

582
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,900
Scott: So he basically was standing there, and he said, "Huh, I have two choices.

583
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:39,236
Scott: I could watch other people work or

584
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:39,538
Scott: work.".

585
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,299
Scott: And, I mean, he's going to be here for three days.

586
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:46,700
Scott: His choices are stand there and be kind of bored or work.

587
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,860
Scott: So, of course, you're going to work.

588
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,280
Rym: Now, the real moral here is this.

589
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,820
Scott: Working at a con is kind of fun.

590
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:59,257
Rym: If you've ever thought about, like, either you're getting bored with anime conventions or fan conventions in general, or you've thought about volunteering but never done it, I'm going to say this.

591
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,780
Rym: Being staff at an anime convention is a crazy amount of work.

592
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:10,418
Rym: I mean, we trivialize it because we've been doing this sort of stuff for so long that even when we do a lot of work at a con, it doesn't feel like a lot of work.

593
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:16,840
Scott: I've never felt like I've done a lot of work at a con ever because it's so easy or I guess we're really good at it.

594
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,639
Rym: Yeah, because it's really fun.

595
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,219
Rym: That's the thing.

596
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,260
Rym: It is so fun to be staff at a convention.

597
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,995
Rym: I mean, you think, "Ah, I'm going to have to

598
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:23,359
Rym: work.".

599
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:32,800
Rym: You, like, stand in there selling registrations to a con, like Otakon, you get to meet, like, four or five thousand people who are going to the con.

600
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:39,580
Rym: You talk to every one of them for a minute while you give them their badge, and that's kind of cool, and those people actually seem to have a really good time.

601
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:54,780
Rym: And the way to become a staffer at a con is to either be an entertainer or start out as a volunteer or a gopher, and a bunch of our listeners actually were volunteers at KatsuCon this year, and every one of them said they had an awesome time and someday they want to be staff.

602
00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:02,540
Scott: Yeah, being a volunteer/gopher can suck in some ways because you don't get the privileges of staff as much, you know?

603
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,659
Rym: But if you're not going to be an entertainer or, like...

604
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,880
Scott: If you're not awesome in some other way where you can just become real staff, like, ding, then that's the path you must take.

605
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,840
Rym: And I'll point out that there wasn't actually a ding.

606
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:21,026
Rym: I mean, we're staff at all these conventions, and that's because we've been doing panels since 2002.

607
00:35:21,026 --> 00:35:21,238
Scott: Yeah.

608
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,160
Rym: Continuously.

609
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,078
Scott: It's not ding.

610
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,120
Rym: Do you know how many panels we've done at frickin' anime conventions?

611
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:27,745
Scott: Too many.

612
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:29,700
Scott: But anyway, so yeah, KatsuCon.

613
00:35:29,981 --> 00:35:31,960
Scott: Let's do a little chronology, just a quick one, right?

614
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,540
Rym: All right, so Thursday morning, we get on the road.

615
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,200
Scott: I'm going to start Thursday morning, get on the road.

616
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,679
Scott: Well, we load the car, we get on the road.

617
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:38,359
Rym: Yep.

618
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,620
Scott: We got three people, which is good.

619
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,400
Scott: One of those is very strong, which helps, because we have a lot of heavy shit.

620
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,479
Rym: Well, I've been lifting weights.

621
00:35:46,323 --> 00:35:47,439
Scott: No, Pete, not you.

622
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:54,100
Rym: God, we had this heavy-ass bin full of GeekNights stuff, and we got all our audio equipment and everything, and we can't carry this thing.

623
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,539
Rym: Last year it was even heavier, and we could barely carry it.

624
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,674
Rym: And we're like, "Look how heavy it is,

625
00:35:58,695 --> 00:35:58,937
Rym: blah.".

626
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:01,500
Rym: Pete picks a damn thing up, like, over his head.

627
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:09,500
Scott: Of course, even he had... When we actually started carrying it long distances, even he had to, you know, stop and rest, just because of the cumbersome-ness of it, you know, and such.

628
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,019
Rym: We drove to Virginia, took the Metro in.

629
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,520
Rym: If you ever go to Katsucon...

630
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,100
Scott: Maryland or Virginia.

631
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:15,760
Rym: Oh, yeah, we could have driven to Virginia.

632
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,700
Rym: Other people drove to Virginia.

633
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,860
Scott: That's a little far to drive.

634
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,940
Rym: Yeah, but you do not want to drive to Katsucon directly.

635
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,100
Rym: The parking is insane.

636
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,015
Rym: There's no reason to...

637
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,017
Scott: Yeah, driving into Washington, D.C.

638
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:26,340
Scott: sucks.

639
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,757
Scott: Parking in Washington, D.C.

640
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:27,960
Scott: sucks.

641
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,580
Rym: The Metro is cheaper and faster.

642
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:30,115
Rym: Yep.

643
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,919
Rym: In fact, parking is free at Katsucon.

644
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:36,780
Scott: We met some people, or we saw some people at a rest stop that were obviously con-goers.

645
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,500
Scott: I think I recognized them from other cons, just the way they look.

646
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,271
Rym: And they actually...

647
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,560
Scott: We saw them at the hotel check-in, you know, and we were carrying heavy things from the Metro.

648
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,280
Rym: We also had the worst-case scenario.

649
00:36:48,662 --> 00:36:51,080
Rym: We got to the platform as a train left.

650
00:36:51,540 --> 00:37:03,118
Scott: Yeah, so we actually, you know, we took the Metro as slow as it possibly could go, you know, carrying a heavy thing, delaying us a lot, and we basically got to the hotel the same time as some other people who drove in.

651
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:07,579
Rym: Well, actually, we got there quite a bit before them, because they were in line quite a bit behind us.

652
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,480
Rym: Oh, wow, awesome.

653
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:10,620
Rym: And they left the rest stop well before we did.

654
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,200
Scott: And they weren't carrying heavy things like we did.

655
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,640
Rym: Yes, but yeah, take the Metro, good God.

656
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,479
Scott: All right, so we take the Metro in.

657
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:19,780
Scott: It sucked to carry the heavy shit, but we got it done, despite sickness.

658
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:20,298
Rym: Yep.

659
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,120
Scott: We did the same thing on the way back, a little bit better.

660
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:28,260
Scott: It still sucks, and we still should get a better carrying bucket or something.

661
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:29,380
Scott: With wheels, maybe?

662
00:37:29,462 --> 00:37:30,138
Scott: I don't fucking know.

663
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:31,699
Scott: We need to do something about it.

664
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,980
Scott: Anyway, get to the con, check in, video game rooms, looking good.

665
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:37,478
Rym: Of course.

666
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:48,520
Rym: I think this is the most telling thing about why Katsucon is so awesome, because GameKatsu, the people who run the gaming at Katsucon, are effectively a completely separate organization.

667
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,260
Scott: We've said this last Katsucon episode.

668
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:51,840
Rym: Entirely autonomously.

669
00:37:52,361 --> 00:37:53,379
Rym: They all know their shit.

670
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,059
Rym: They're like convention badasses.

671
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,840
Rym: They're even, on their own, putting together their own gaming con.

672
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,440
Rym: We're going to talk about that once it gets closer.

673
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:03,600
Rym: We're probably going to be there doing stuff, because it looks pretty awesome.

674
00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:14,940
Scott: We talked about all this in the last Katsucon episode, but the arcade cabinets from Videotopia made a comeback, and they were as awesome as ever, most notably Virtua Racing.

675
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,199
Scott: Best racing game ever created.

676
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,409
Rym: Yes, if you want to see a bunch of pictures of us wheeling these things in and setting them up, look at my flicker.

677
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,139
Rym: I got a lot of them.

678
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:22,901
Scott: Yeah.

679
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:25,640
Scott: Also, Satan's Hollow made a notable appearance.

680
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,052
Rym: I got real good at Satan's Hollow.

681
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,859
Rym: We'll talk about that.

682
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:32,759
Scott: I also played Satan's Hollow, and I did kind of well, but I sucked on the high score list.

683
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:34,431
Scott: Then, I'm like, "Oh, the

684
00:38:34,491 --> 00:38:34,996
Scott: shield.".

685
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:35,520
Scott: Right.

686
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,659
Rym: We'll talk about Satan's Hollow, because Peter did some awesome things.

687
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:53,057
Rym: But I think what's most telling about how awesome the game Katsu staff are is that there was an email in the staff thing, kind of before Katsucon, like, "All right, guys, so you think the video game room will be opened by, I don't know, noon on

688
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:53,619
Rym: Friday?".

689
00:38:54,861 --> 00:39:00,378
Rym: And the response was, "If it's not ready to go Thursday night, something is seriously

690
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:00,799
Rym: wrong.".

691
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,880
Scott: And it was ready to go, well, pretty much.

692
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,285
Rym: By like 9 p.m.

693
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:11,772
Rym: Thursday night, the game room, other than Nintendo's display, which took a while for them to set up, was done.

694
00:39:12,013 --> 00:39:13,200
Rym: We were playing video games.

695
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,479
Scott: Yeah, Nintendo, at this convention, you gotta understand, they had mad Professor Layton marketing going on.

696
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,860
Rym: They had people on Segways going around.

697
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,600
Scott: They had people on Segways rolling around the dealer's room.

698
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,040
Rym: They had people wearing gigantic DS's, and you could play puzzles from the game on them.

699
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:37,120
Scott: They had this thing that was like projecting onto the floor, and it was a touch interactive floor thing advertising this game in the room that had the arcade cabinets.

700
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:45,016
Rym: Every time I saw a little kid looking at this thing and enjoying himself, I charged over, jumped on it, made everything scatter, and the kids would always clap and scream and go,

701
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:45,939
Rym: "Yay!".

702
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:52,065
Scott: Yup, so basically there was mad Professor Layton going on, and the thing was

703
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:52,125
Rym: is

704
00:39:52,407 --> 00:40:01,616
Scott: I was going to buy Professor Layton even before I got to the con, and then when I got to the con and saw this marketing, I'm like, "You're making me want to not buy it just to punish you for having all this

705
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:02,078
Scott: marketing.".

706
00:40:02,744 --> 00:40:04,340
Scott: But I bought it anyway, and we'll talk about it later.

707
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:09,420
Rym: Yeah, but the video game room was hard fucking core, as always.

708
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,679
Rym: The bag check, which was a difficult issue last year.

709
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,820
Rym: Flawless this year.

710
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,484
Rym: Perfectly.

711
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:17,080
Rym: There were no problems at all.

712
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,359
Scott: There was a little bit of a line at some busy times, but that was it.

713
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:22,700
Scott: It was a managed and reasonable line.

714
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,575
Rym: Yeah, and the rock band was going, the DDR was going, the Smash Bros.

715
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:28,940
Rym: Brawl was going.

716
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,720
Scott: It was going a little bit, a little bit.

717
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:31,539
Rym: It was going a lot.

718
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:32,457
Scott: I avoided it.

719
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:35,920
Rym: I also avoided it, but it was pretty rocking.

720
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,880
Rym: There was a staff and cool people only party at some point where everyone just played Brawl.

721
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:54,939
Scott: Yeah, basically a web comic artist had brought it and provided it, and they treated it specially as it should be treated, because it needs special treatment when you get a pre-release game like that, but they handled it very well.

722
00:40:56,023 --> 00:41:05,064
Scott: The only thing I could say bad about the video game room was that there was a lack of quality selection in the console room, but whatever.

723
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:07,320
Scott: What kind of selection do you want?

724
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:22,000
Rym: Well, the thing is, the people who made that complaint would probably have also complained about Otakon or Ubercon or any other con, because I went around that video game room and there was plenty to play, and every console had a lot of people at all hours.

725
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,693
Rym: I mean, Katsucon, remember, is 24/7 con.

726
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,020
Rym: There were people in that video game room.

727
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:28,032
Scott: At 3 a.m.

728
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:28,720
Scott: on Saturday.

729
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,600
Rym: Enough people to where you had to wait in a line to play rock band.

730
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,514
Scott: Oh, you had to wait in line to play rock band at like 4 a.m.

731
00:41:34,695 --> 00:41:35,540
Scott: on freaking Friday.

732
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,220
Rym: Ah, it was hardcore.

733
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,918
Scott: I didn't play it even once.

734
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,320
Rym: We had a pretty cool setup in the room.

735
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:48,700
Rym: Unlike last year, we actually had a professional setup, so it was really, really easy to play music and generally entertain the room.

736
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:54,880
Scott: Yup, and there wasn't this clash of loud musics competing with each other, making everyone deaf either.

737
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,360
Scott: It was a very much better setup, and we didn't have those giant projectors to the sides of us.

738
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,732
Rym: Yeah, we didn't get as many projectors as we did last year.

739
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,500
Scott: What was that game that they were playing?

740
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:07,280
Scott: Pop and music.

741
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:10,520
Rym: Pop and music is like the stupidest goddamn thing in the world.

742
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,618
Scott: Pop and music is fucking stupid.

743
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,859
Scott: That's all I gotta say.

744
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,240
Scott: Alright, so enough about the video game room.

745
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,720
Scott: Most of what we have to talk about Katsucon is the events that we ran.

746
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,500
Scott: Let's talk about them, and then let's be done with it.

747
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:30,500
Rym: Alright, first, let's talk a bit about what we did in the video game room, because these are the things that were the unscripted things.

748
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:57,158
Rym: Last year, too, and I think we're gonna do this forever, you know, we're in the video game room a lot, not so much this year, because Scott was sick, and I was running around dealing with six panels, but we had the Atari 7800 with us, and we had all these arcade cabinets, and last year, randomly, usually at like 2 or 3 in the morning, we'd just say on the microphone to everyone in the room, "Alright, bitches, Street Fighter I tournament, let's

749
00:42:57,238 --> 00:42:57,460
Rym: go.".

750
00:42:57,621 --> 00:43:16,900
Scott: I played, actually, at one point during the con, I just remembered this, I played Street Fighter I single player, and I sort of figured it out, and I went without losing for a very long time against the computer, and then a guy came up and challenged me, and I beat him, and another guy came up and challenged me, and I beat him.

751
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:17,990
Rym: Were they playing as Ken?

752
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,340
Rym: Because Ken couldn't duck, there was a problem with the controller.

753
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:21,518
Scott: I think I was Ken.

754
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,678
Rym: So you couldn't hadoken?

755
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:24,659
Scott: No, I was hadokening.

756
00:43:25,382 --> 00:43:26,820
Rym: Ah, maybe it wasn't broken at that point.

757
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:38,319
Scott: Maybe, but I was freaking not sucking at every other Street Fighter, and on my first try, one token, I beat a whole lot of people in Street Fighter I.

758
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:51,000
Rym: But, you know, we had the Rampart tournament last year, and this year, we did not disappoint, despite being tired, I ran, and this went so well, like I cannot express to you how well it went, an Outlaw tournament.

759
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,160
Rym: Outlaw being probably the best game to ever come out in the Atari 2600.

760
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,820
Rym: Uh, maybe.

761
00:43:56,102 --> 00:43:58,180
Rym: The best two-player direct versus game.

762
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:58,838
Scott: That's for sure.

763
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,219
Rym: It's just two cowboys fighting, so I announced a...

764
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:04,500
Scott: They really need to make a modding remake of Outlaw.

765
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,195
Rym: I announced a single elimination game.

766
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:09,760
Rym: A lot of people signed up.

767
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,620
Scott: We should make an Outlaw Half-Life mod.

768
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:24,060
Rym: Not only did I run the tournament to completion, not only was it amazing, and not only did we have a large crowd of spectators, because something like that is cool to watch, I did not have to even coach these people to trash talk each other.

769
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:26,500
Rym: The trash talk was excellent.

770
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,539
Rym: I cannot applaud you people more.

771
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,380
Rym: And furthermore, a good half the people in the tournament were already good at Outlaw.

772
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,859
Scott: Well, there were these two guys who were brothers that had played Outlaw in their youth.

773
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,260
Scott: I think these guys were Otakon related also in some way.

774
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,315
Rym: Yes, it came down...

775
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,500
Scott: I forget their names, though, but I've seen them before at conventions.

776
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,960
Rym: But there were some good people.

777
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,239
Scott: They were really good, and they were the final two.

778
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,460
Rym: Yes, the final round came down to brother versus brother.

779
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,999
Rym: We milled the shit out of that.

780
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,719
Scott: Yeah, they beat me.

781
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:59,740
Scott: We came close, but he took me out in the semi-final.

782
00:45:00,442 --> 00:45:08,839
Rym: Now, Peter, he was staffing the video game room for Much of the Con, and he decided to go one step further, because we had the music set up, and he had some metal with him.

783
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,932
Rym: So he ran the, I think it was midnight or 2

784
00:45:11,932 --> 00:45:12,274
Rym: a.m.,

785
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:13,420
Rym: metal hour.

786
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:18,840
Rym: And during that metal hour, he ran a Satan's Hollow tournament.

787
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:19,818
Scott: Oh, man.

788
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:24,799
Rym: He advertised it all day on the Satan's Hollow machine, and a lot of people showed up.

789
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,380
Rym: I am told it was epic.

790
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,172
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't there.

791
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:28,679
Scott: I was in bed.

792
00:45:29,321 --> 00:45:31,683
Rym: Also, Pete being somewhat of a sadist, we had

793
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:32,833
Rym: E.T.,

794
00:45:32,874 --> 00:45:33,540
Rym: the Atari game.

795
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:37,200
Rym: We put it up a lot, because a lot of people were interested.

796
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,480
Scott: Well, it's a curiosity.

797
00:45:38,941 --> 00:45:39,699
Rym: We kept joking.

798
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,113
Rym: Hey, let's run an E.T.

799
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:41,540
Rym: tournament.

800
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:43,072
Scott: I have to say again, you know, E.T.

801
00:45:43,193 --> 00:45:45,613
Scott: is a bad game, but everyone acts like E.T.

802
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:46,520
Scott: is the worst game ever.

803
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:47,930
Scott: It is just a terrible game.

804
00:45:47,951 --> 00:45:49,139
Scott: It is not the worst game ever.

805
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:51,920
Rym: Anyway, so we kept joking.

806
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,074
Rym: Yeah, we're going to run an E.T.

807
00:45:53,135 --> 00:45:53,480
Rym: tournament.

808
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:55,596
Rym: And some people would go,

809
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:55,940
Rym: "Haha.".

810
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,911
Rym: And some people would go, "Really?

811
00:45:56,951 --> 00:45:57,174
Rym: When?".

812
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,489
Rym: And those "Really?

813
00:45:58,509 --> 00:45:58,671
Rym: When?"

814
00:45:58,711 --> 00:45:59,500
Rym: people were a little scary.

815
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,259
Rym: But eventually, Pete just decided, "All right, I'm doing

816
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:03,339
Rym: it.".

817
00:46:03,784 --> 00:46:04,493
Rym: And he ran an E.T.

818
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:05,040
Rym: tournament.

819
00:46:05,586 --> 00:46:06,279
Scott: How did that work?

820
00:46:06,741 --> 00:46:07,872
Rym: He just had them all play.

821
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:08,679
Rym: High score wins.

822
00:46:09,406 --> 00:46:09,799
Scott: All right.

823
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:21,607
Rym: And not only did a lot of people compete, not only was it quite the spectator event, but this little girl who was not even conceived when E.T.

824
00:46:21,668 --> 00:46:25,798
Rym: was shredded and buried in the desert kicked everyone's asses.

825
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:26,865
Scott: Wow.

826
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:27,680
Scott: Did she know how to play?

827
00:46:27,948 --> 00:46:28,077
Scott: No.

828
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,779
Scott: She's just randomly going around.

829
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:37,460
Rym: She figured it out because little kids... It's weird how little kids seem to have much less trouble just figuring out old video games than adults do.

830
00:46:37,681 --> 00:46:38,199
Scott: That's for sure.

831
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:46,320
Rym: I mean, if I hand, like, someone my age, the controller of Atari, they fall in the pool, they get out of the hole, they fall in the hole, get out of the hole, fall in the hole, say, "Fuck this," and walk away.

832
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:53,299
Rym: Little kids, much like when I was a little kid, will sit there until they figure it out, and then they'll become the best little kid ever at it.

833
00:46:55,262 --> 00:46:59,800
Scott: That's why we had the mad skills at those NES games like Bionic Commando and Mega Man 2.

834
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,300
Rym: God, I can beat Bionic Commando in, like, 28 minutes straight through.

835
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:08,280
Scott: I can beat Mega Man 2 pretty much as, I guess, close to as fast as it can be beaten reasonably without some sort of emulator.

836
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:08,771
Rym: On easy.

837
00:47:10,105 --> 00:47:10,780
Scott: No, on normal.

838
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,020
Scott: It's pretty much eat normal and American mode.

839
00:47:14,105 --> 00:47:14,318
Scott: Nah.

840
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:15,780
Rym: All right.

841
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,580
Rym: But anyway, aside from that, we ran a bunch of events.

842
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,999
Rym: I'd say about 68% of them succeeded.

843
00:47:21,443 --> 00:47:22,340
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

844
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,580
Scott: It wasn't total success across the board.

845
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,319
Scott: It was actually kind of weird.

846
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,600
Scott: Let's talk, well, let's, see, the thing is-- Let's do chronological on Friday.

847
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,559
Rym: Chronological, or we could do an order of success, reverse success.

848
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,000
Scott: No, no, let's do chronological.

849
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,360
Rym: All right, so Friday.

850
00:47:35,881 --> 00:47:37,400
Rym: Friday was actually a big night for us.

851
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,820
Scott: All our events were actually, except for one, were late.

852
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,939
Scott: So we had, like, these empty days and then a bunch of events.

853
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,659
Scott: An empty day, bunch of events.

854
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:47,900
Scott: So first-- And then we had no events Sunday.

855
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:50,940
Rym: We had the anime match game, which is a perennial favorite.

856
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,839
Rym: We run it at every con we go to, I think.

857
00:47:53,301 --> 00:47:55,480
Rym: I think we're going to be running it at Otakon.

858
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,780
Rym: There's been some interest from events as opposed to panels.

859
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,411
Scott: Oh, man.

860
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,780
Rym: Because we run this thing pretty solidly at this point.

861
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:04,719
Rym: We had all new questions.

862
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,480
Rym: They were a huge success.

863
00:48:08,782 --> 00:48:11,140
Rym: The guests on the panel were absolutely amazing.

864
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,120
Rym: It was like the best match game we've ever run.

865
00:48:13,382 --> 00:48:17,440
Scott: It wasn't the best attended match game, even though it was very, very well attended.

866
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:19,960
Scott: I think we had more people at New York Anime Festival.

867
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:31,659
Scott: But it was, I guess, game-wise, in terms of the quality of the panel, the quality of the questions, the quality of the answers, the quality of the presentation, the best running of the anime match game we have ever performed.

868
00:48:32,762 --> 00:48:38,200
Scott: The only thing I can say is I wish it would have been two hours and we need a new contestant selection mechanism.

869
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:38,997
Rym: Yes, we do.

870
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,680
Rym: Because I'm sorry contestants.

871
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:42,039
Scott: I thought of a few.

872
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:44,020
Scott: And I think we're going to try them out next time.

873
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,440
Rym: Because I'm sorry contestants who were on the show, if you're listening.

874
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,259
Rym: It was cool and all, but you guys couldn't come up with funny answers at all.

875
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,619
Scott: Yeah, it's like contestants, you were cool people.

876
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:58,079
Scott: So you were actually a little bit more knowledgeable about anime than some former contestants, so you're not too bad.

877
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,220
Scott: Because the guy said Odongos, right?

878
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:01,232
Scott: You knew the-- Yes.

879
00:49:02,002 --> 00:49:04,700
Rym: That was actually too hardcore for some of the guests.

880
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:05,240
Scott: Right.

881
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:07,159
Scott: But-- And the audience.

882
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,900
Rym: So I had to actually explain what a fucking Odongo was, you people.

883
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:14,218
Scott: Yeah, but they were not very good at matching the panel.

884
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:22,219
Scott: They didn't seem to-- It's like if I was-- It was obvious, especially on one particular question, who is the hottest girl in anime?

885
00:49:22,681 --> 00:49:26,160
Scott: It was obvious what answer was going to get you a zillion points.

886
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,139
Scott: Obvious.

887
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:32,799
Scott: Anyone who was actually conscious and understood what was going on and was paying attention would have gotten it.

888
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:41,800
Rym: It's kind of like when we were at New York Anime Festival and we had the original voice of Speed Racer on the panel.

889
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,720
Scott: And we said, "Name an old anime," and the guy did not write Speed Racer.

890
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,050
Scott: It's like, "Hello.

891
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:48,172
Rym: Hello.".

892
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:50,059
Rym: Yes, God, God.

893
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,089
Scott: Yeah, so--.

894
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,220
Rym: But, you know, actually, you're talking about attendance.

895
00:49:53,660 --> 00:50:02,280
Rym: If you count percentage of Total Con attendees, it was probably equally well attended because there were a lot more people at New York Anime Festival, but-- I don't think there were more people at New York.

896
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:04,200
Scott: Oh, I guess, technically.

897
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,440
Rym: There were 6,000 and some people at Katsucon.

898
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:15,600
Scott: Yeah, but that's 6,000 and some people at Katsucon were there from Thursday to Monday, but the people at New York Anime Festival were mostly just there Saturday only and then gone.

899
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,999
Rym: Yes, but that's when we ran our events.

900
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:17,806
Scott: That's true.

901
00:50:17,888 --> 00:50:18,820
Scott: So it's a tough call.

902
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:26,278
Rym: The other tricky thing is that usually we run the match game during the day because we've learned from doing all these cons, and Katsucon has proved it.

903
00:50:28,923 --> 00:50:37,679
Rym: What a panel is about has very little to do with how it is attended as opposed to what room it's in, what time it's at, and what else is scheduled at that time.

904
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,498
Scott: And what it's named.

905
00:50:39,007 --> 00:50:39,077
Scott: Yes.

906
00:50:39,721 --> 00:50:41,720
Scott: What it's named on the handheld schedule.

907
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,020
Scott: The description in the con book means almost nothing.

908
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:55,340
Rym: But the nice thing was, because we ran this match game late at night, we were able to be a lot more risque with the questions, and let me tell you, were the guests a lot more risque with their answers.

909
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,600
Scott: The very first question and the very best answer of the entire match game, Naruto Pregnancy Test.

910
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:02,500
Rym: Oh my god.

911
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,140
Rym: And the fact that that kept coming up for the rest of the night.

912
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,233
Scott: It came up one more time.

913
00:51:06,435 --> 00:51:06,799
Scott: It was good.

914
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,240
Rym: Oh man, that was great.

915
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:14,759
Rym: I'm liking having the daytime events, or the get a whole bunch of people and do a standard panel.

916
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,400
Rym: But I like these late night kind of eerie events.

917
00:51:19,122 --> 00:51:20,620
Scott: I love those late night eerie events.

918
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,960
Scott: I think, next Katsucon, I'm going to actually plan.

919
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,720
Scott: I'm going to come up with some new panels.

920
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:33,676
Scott: This Katsucon, seeing how things went, maybe part because of my delirium, and because the only thing that I was...

921
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:34,462
Rym: Wait a minute.

922
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:38,800
Rym: You planning panels based on your delirium is like Kazuo Koike writing manga.

923
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:51,220
Scott: Well, because the only thing I experienced at the con was thinking while laying in bed, sleeping, eating, and running panels, pretty much, with a little bit of Virtua Racing mixed, and Street Fighter 1 mixed in, right?

924
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:54,240
Scott: I was thinking pretty much just about the panels.

925
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,160
Rym: Also, there was a turnabout, but we'll talk about that Saturday.

926
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,539
Scott: But I think now I have the formula for the awesome panels of the future, and I think it is going to be quite awesome.

927
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:11,100
Rym: But anyway, so right after that, we had The Late Show, which this was a first for us.

928
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,560
Rym: This was probably our most ambitious attempt yet.

929
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:20,080
Rym: But sadly, because it was super late at night, there were a lot of people in the audience, but not nearly as many as we had hoped for.

930
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,380
Scott: Well, I think we were also competing with a concert, and yeah, there were not as many people as we had hoped for, but there were enough people.

931
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:30,679
Rym: 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock is a better time slot for a bigger con.

932
00:52:31,522 --> 00:52:34,200
Rym: Like an Otakon, that would have been one of those packed things.

933
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,499
Rym: But at Katsucon, especially with the dance, which unlike other cons is actually awesome, we had some trouble.

934
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,319
Scott: Well, we were competing with the concert, not the dance.

935
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,379
Rym: Well, there was a dance right after it.

936
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,159
Scott: But remember, we're also competing with the Late Night Video Game Room at Otakon.

937
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:48,880
Scott: And with sleeping.

938
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:56,920
Scott: But anyway, I sort of had a little plan for the start of the event, and I was sick, you know, whatever.

939
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,609
Rym: Well, here's the full deal.

940
00:52:57,649 --> 00:52:59,511
Rym: We were sick and tired, but we were okay.

941
00:52:59,532 --> 00:53:00,159
Rym: We were set to go.

942
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,039
Scott: Sick and tired.

943
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:13,080
Rym: But there were some logistical concerns with the guests we were to have, and as a result, we kind of had to stand up on stage and delay and delay and cover for someone for a little while.

944
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:22,280
Scott: And then the clever intro that I had come up with like an hour previously couldn't be used because the guest wasn't right there at the beginning, and I couldn't rework it, and I was sick.

945
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,826
Rym: But I'll leave it at this.

946
00:53:24,027 --> 00:53:28,240
Rym: We had Stevie B for most of the show, but for the first half, we had Greg Ayers.

947
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:35,680
Rym: And let me tell you, I really want to do a full-on better, more well-attended Late Show with Greg Ayers and Steve Bennett again.

948
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:40,420
Rym: At least because Greg Ayers is a pretty damn cool dude, I have to say.

949
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:46,359
Scott: Yeah, I mean, the guy, you know, I didn't know much about him at all before, you know, doing the show.

950
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,700
Rym: He put off peeing to be on the Late Show.

951
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,420
Scott: Yeah, big thanks to him because, you know, he skipped.

952
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:56,416
Scott: He's friends with Johnny Young Bosch, you know, and he was there at the con, you know, Mr.

953
00:53:56,436 --> 00:53:56,980
Scott: Power Ranger.

954
00:53:57,604 --> 00:54:07,190
Scott: And he basically, he didn't go to his friend's concert, which was happening in the other room, and he put off peeing just to be on our Late Show as, you know, he had promised and as was scheduled.

955
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:08,020
Scott: He didn't have to do that.

956
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:16,680
Scott: He could have been an asshole, but he came to do our not super well-attended but okay-attended Late Show anyway, and he stayed there and kept answering our questions.

957
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:25,839
Rym: Yeah, we didn't actually record it, partly because we were incredibly tired and we just didn't have time to set all that up, and also because there was a lot of visual components to it.

958
00:54:26,422 --> 00:54:30,500
Rym: But it was quite an interesting talk for anyone who attended.

959
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,380
Scott: Yeah, I kept asking him questions and he was answering them in a totally cool, open, honest way, like I would have.

960
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,260
Scott: And I don't agree with some of the opinions I learned he has, but it doesn't matter, he was pretty cool.

961
00:54:41,621 --> 00:54:42,459
Scott: And he said cool stuff.

962
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,632
Rym: Yep, and then he finally went off to pee after drinking much of our "orange

963
00:54:45,652 --> 00:54:45,834
Rym: juice."

964
00:54:46,724 --> 00:54:47,420
Rym: It was orange juice.

965
00:54:47,500 --> 00:55:04,619
Rym: And then the rest of the night was with The Depths of Stevie V. And we've talked, I don't need to sing the phrases of having Stevie V at your event at a convention, but we've talked about him before, he's a pretty interesting dude, and we went well into the night learning about Civil War reenactment and the hat story.

966
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:07,820
Rym: And I think that was a good close for Friday night.

967
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,179
Rym: The people who stuck around to the end seemed to really, really enjoy it, more so than I expected them to.

968
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,140
Scott: Yep, and also Kate, you know, she sang her song.

969
00:55:15,202 --> 00:55:15,598
Rym: Oh yeah.

970
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,559
Scott: It was pretty awesome.

971
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:25,519
Rym: We had our musical act planned, and it was funny because you could see the audience, like Kate's going out, and Kate's a really, like she knows how to entertain, she learned how to do this stuff in school.

972
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,700
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much like we learned computers in school, she learned singing and dancing and all that kind of stuff.

973
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:39,911
Rym: So, we break for the musical act, and Kate comes out, and you see the audience going, "Ah, some girl, this is like some karaoke

974
00:55:39,932 --> 00:55:40,336
Rym: bullshit.".

975
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:45,856
Rym: And then she starts with the first verse of "Gotta Knock a Little Harder," and you could see the entire audience go, "Holy

976
00:55:46,037 --> 00:55:46,259
Rym: shit!".

977
00:55:46,864 --> 00:55:47,509
Scott: They're like, "What?

978
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:48,698
Scott: A real musical act?

979
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:48,900
Rym: What?

980
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:50,453
Scott: I didn't realize this was going on.

981
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:50,695
Scott: What the

982
00:55:50,735 --> 00:55:50,937
Scott: fuck?".

983
00:55:51,300 --> 00:56:00,460
Rym: So, despite being tired and having a lot of logistical issues, we learned a lot, and I think we can pull off this event times a thousand in the future.

984
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,240
Scott: Oh, definitely.

985
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:09,760
Rym: So, stay tuned for late-night GeekNights, or late-night Katsucon, or late-night something new and improved in the future, because we figured this shit out, is what I can say.

986
00:56:09,861 --> 00:56:13,140
Scott: Yeah, one other thing I had to say about that event is we had Uncle Yo there, right?

987
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:18,719
Scott: And we promised that we would let him do his, you know, his anime otaku stand-up comedy for a portion of the show.

988
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,130
Rym: There were a lot of timing concerns.

989
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,300
Rym: We had to cut a lot out of the show.

990
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,620
Scott: Yeah, we had to cut stuff out of the show.

991
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:28,580
Scott: Basically, we made an itinerary for the show, like, you know, this is how long we'll do things, and that totally got blown out of the water.

992
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:35,080
Rym: Yes, well, you realize, I know a lot about doing panels and giving speeches, and I know a lot about doing a radio show.

993
00:56:35,781 --> 00:56:43,459
Rym: I didn't know jack shit about, like, plotting out and staging any sort of stage performance as opposed to talk.

994
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,898
Scott: Yeah, and sit there and talk for the allotted time is pretty much the limit of our abilities.

995
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:59,280
Rym: Yeah, we had Emily down there, like, she was queuing us because she actually took charge of a lot of our back-end problems and fixed a lot of things for us, but she was writing, oh, pardon me, like, "15 minutes left for this.

996
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:00,640
Rym: You got to get him off the stage.

997
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,060
Rym: Stop him from talking so you can have Uncle Yo.

998
00:57:03,361 --> 00:57:07,460
Rym: This is coming up," and writing on the whiteboards from the match game, and that pretty much saved our asses.

999
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:12,520
Scott: Yeah, it's like I saw Uncle Yo, like, sitting on the side, like, with this box of, you know, props, and I felt real bad.

1000
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:17,670
Scott: I'm like, "I promised you time on the show, but Steve Bennett is still talking about his hat, and I can't stop him, and, uh...".

1001
00:57:18,841 --> 00:57:20,300
Scott: But then we got him in at the last minute.

1002
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,186
Rym: And I'll just say this.

1003
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:27,740
Rym: Uncle Yo is kind of like, he's kind of new on the anime circuit, and unlike the Geek Comedy Tour, which, they were actually pretty funny.

1004
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,180
Scott: Yeah, but they weren't so geeky with their comedy.

1005
00:57:30,682 --> 00:57:33,220
Scott: They were geeks doing normal stand-up comedy.

1006
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:35,460
Rym: I don't want to disparage them because they put on a really good show.

1007
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,433
Scott: Yeah, I laughed at them.

1008
00:57:36,473 --> 00:57:36,980
Scott: They were good stuff.

1009
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,180
Rym: I laughed hysterically at a few of those jokes, especially the second Alaska Eye.

1010
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,180
Scott: They were on before our anime match game, I think, right?

1011
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:42,945
Scott: Yes, yes.

1012
00:57:43,288 --> 00:58:01,358
Rym: But what they do, and this is not in any way going to speak about the level of their comedy, because they're good, but obviously they kind of, they're picking the low-hanging fruit of doing shows because doing a normal stand-up act at an anime con is real easy to get a lot of people to really enjoy

1013
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:01,640
Scott: themselves.

1014
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,060
Scott: Yeah, it's like, you know, they weren't, like, professional.

1015
00:58:03,725 --> 00:58:07,120
Scott: I'm talking, you know, like, they weren't George Carlin Lewis Black level, you know?

1016
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,980
Rym: But they were better than a lot of comedy acts I've seen live in clubs before.

1017
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,140
Scott: They were ten times better than Open Mic Night, you know, at the local joint.

1018
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,000
Rym: But Uncle Yo does something really different.

1019
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:22,560
Rym: He actually does topical humor about anime and manga.

1020
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:27,040
Rym: And we saw him before, you know, he performed at the New York Anime Festival, and we talked to him.

1021
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,977
Rym: We promised him this short gig at Katsucon.

1022
00:58:32,185 --> 00:58:34,220
Rym: And, like, you can see him improving.

1023
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:39,100
Rym: Like, his set at Katsucon was noticeably better than his set at New York Anime.

1024
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:46,020
Rym: Like, he's getting better, he's getting good, and we're really trying hard to get him a full-on set at ConnectiCon and Oticon.

1025
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:53,260
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know, other podcasts may have said that, you know, like, they saw him at New York Anime Festival, and they thought he was lame, and they didn't laugh.

1026
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:56,180
Scott: And, you know, I'll be honest, you know, I have nothing against the guy.

1027
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:03,280
Scott: You know, I met him, he's cool, he's sociable, he's a nice person, you know, and he's trying hard and such, but I didn't laugh at him.

1028
00:59:03,701 --> 00:59:06,400
Scott: I didn't think he was funny that much at New York Anime Festival either.

1029
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,100
Scott: Maybe, you know, it's just not my thing, kinda.

1030
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:13,860
Scott: And also, my number, actually, the only gripe I actually have with him is that he pronounces a lot of things incorrectly.

1031
00:59:14,601 --> 00:59:20,459
Scott: But, you know, no matter what you can say about the guy, he got the audience, really likes it.

1032
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:22,159
Rym: The audience was going crazy.

1033
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:26,440
Scott: So, whether, you know, you think he's funny or not, it worked.

1034
00:59:26,681 --> 00:59:31,860
Scott: And even if I didn't think he was funny, and actually, he was kinda funny this time compared to the New York Anime Festival.

1035
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:36,200
Rym: I like to say, I really liked his bit about, like, Shonen manga versus shoujo manga.

1036
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:37,420
Rym: That was a really well-put-together bit.

1037
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,539
Scott: Yeah, that bit I actually laughed at, you know.

1038
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:51,100
Scott: And, you know, regardless of that, even if I thought he was a bastard and I thought all his comedy was lame, which I don't, I would let him on any panel I was doing.

1039
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:54,420
Scott: I'd give him time, because freaking, it makes the audience laugh.

1040
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:56,840
Scott: And if he's associated with me, that makes me look good, too.

1041
00:59:57,401 --> 01:00:00,680
Rym: So, if you're at a con and you see Uncle Yo, it's worth your while to check him out.

1042
01:00:00,985 --> 01:00:01,071
Rym: Yeah.

1043
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,500
Rym: But, moving on to Saturday.

1044
01:00:05,008 --> 01:00:05,840
Rym: Now, this is the panel.

1045
01:00:06,421 --> 01:00:09,460
Rym: I submitted this because, you know, I handle all the PR, producer kind of stuff.

1046
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,640
Rym: So, I get all the panels at cons.

1047
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:13,940
Rym: I do all that business.

1048
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,180
Scott: It was our only morning panel.

1049
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,379
Scott: Well, it was the noon panel, right?

1050
01:00:18,084 --> 01:00:18,740
Rym: Yeah, something like that.

1051
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,500
Scott: So, noon Saturday is apparently a great time for panels.

1052
01:00:21,662 --> 01:00:22,180
Scott: Oh, definitely.

1053
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,860
Rym: But, I put this panel in.

1054
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,800
Rym: I didn't even tell Scott about it until after I put it in.

1055
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:26,235
Rym: And he's like,

1056
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:26,339
Rym: "What?".

1057
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,340
Scott: I thought you didn't put it in.

1058
01:00:27,421 --> 01:00:28,899
Scott: I thought you said the con gave it to you.

1059
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,079
Rym: No, I put it in because I knew.

1060
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:31,020
Scott: Oh, you suck.

1061
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:31,598
Scott: You didn't...

1062
01:00:31,741 --> 01:00:33,900
Rym: And then I had to lie to make sure you do the panel.

1063
01:00:34,323 --> 01:00:36,657
Rym: So, I put in this panel, "Anime You Should

1064
01:00:36,697 --> 01:00:36,878
Rym: See.".

1065
01:00:37,322 --> 01:00:39,140
Scott: So generic and bleh.

1066
01:00:39,481 --> 01:00:42,380
Rym: Well, my thinking was, we're badasses at this.

1067
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,020
Rym: I've been doing panels forever.

1068
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:48,480
Rym: And my panels are almost always super well attended and super awesome.

1069
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,119
Rym: And people always super, super, super like them.

1070
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:54,900
Rym: So, I realized we could do a panel like this trivially with no effort, no preparation.

1071
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,058
Scott: Yeah, because it's so... But, it seemed like, you know, "Anime You Should

1072
01:00:58,098 --> 01:00:58,220
Scott: See.".

1073
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:58,779
Scott: I mean, come on.

1074
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,916
Scott: You go to an anime con and you go to a panel where people say, "This is the anime you should

1075
01:01:02,956 --> 01:01:03,239
Scott: watch.".

1076
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:04,567
Rym: But, you know what?

1077
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:12,420
Rym: The importance of a panel like that is that most people who go to anime cons have not seen a lot of anime yet.

1078
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,059
Rym: They don't have local anime clubs.

1079
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,640
Rym: They have no real way to know what's good, what's not.

1080
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,440
Rym: And they don't watch a lot because, you know, a lot of things are bad.

1081
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,458
Rym: It's hard to get the good stuff.

1082
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,848
Rym: So, much of the panel, I mean, much of the audience had never seen "Cowboy Bebop" or

1083
01:01:26,909 --> 01:01:27,480
Rym: "Escaflowne.".

1084
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:28,059
Scott: Yeah, we asked.

1085
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,395
Scott: Like, who here has seen "Cowboy

1086
01:01:29,415 --> 01:01:29,740
Scott: Bebop?"?

1087
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:34,558
Scott: And about half, maybe a little 49%, something like that, had seen the show and the other half hadn't.

1088
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,553
Scott: And I'm like, "What the

1089
01:01:35,593 --> 01:01:35,756
Scott: hell?".

1090
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:41,678
Scott: You're such an anime fan that you come to an anime convention for an entire weekend and you haven't seen "Cowboy

1091
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:41,800
Scott: Bebop.".

1092
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:47,399
Rym: See, now you can't malign these people because they came to the anime convention because they like anime and they want to learn more about it.

1093
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,899
Rym: So, you can't be a snob and say, "All right, you shouldn't have those generic

1094
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:51,040
Rym: panels.".

1095
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,300
Scott: I can't, but think about that.

1096
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,940
Scott: That's like, that's so crazy.

1097
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,358
Rym: No, because, I mean, think of it.

1098
01:01:55,681 --> 01:01:56,880
Rym: You just got into anime.

1099
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,019
Rym: You saw two good shows.

1100
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,780
Scott: But people didn't just get into anime.

1101
01:02:00,241 --> 01:02:02,780
Scott: If you're going to anime cons, you have to be into anime for a while.

1102
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:08,074
Rym: A lot of people just get into anime and then, like, a year later, they see, "Oh, there's anime

1103
01:02:08,094 --> 01:02:08,360
Rym: cons?".

1104
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:08,810
Rym: You know what?

1105
01:02:08,871 --> 01:02:09,198
Scott: That's it.

1106
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,640
Scott: Next con, we're going to ask how long people have been anime fans for.

1107
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:14,538
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

1108
01:02:14,942 --> 01:02:15,940
Rym: This is what I have to learn.

1109
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:25,199
Rym: I asked that at a lot of panels I run in other conventions and most people at most conventions I talk to, it's their first anime con and they've been watching anime for maybe a year.

1110
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:25,844
Scott: Wow.

1111
01:02:26,596 --> 01:02:26,840
Scott: Anyway.

1112
01:02:27,362 --> 01:02:40,320
Rym: But this panel, we need panels like this because a lot of these people, and a lot of people, like, talk to us afterward, they went out and watched this stuff and they're, you know, they never would have thought to watch Cowboy Bebop, but we told them about it.

1113
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:47,100
Rym: We said it was good and now they're going to go out and see it and they're going to kind of step up their anime fandom and learn more and spread out and branch out.

1114
01:02:48,184 --> 01:02:51,820
Rym: And we basically just talked about all the must-see amazing anime out there.

1115
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,769
Rym: We got the audience up.

1116
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:53,860
Rym: It was real kind of informal.

1117
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,400
Scott: Yeah, all we did was sort of sit around and talk about anime we liked for an hour.

1118
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,512
Rym: Talk about a standing room only.

1119
01:03:01,693 --> 01:03:03,360
Rym: No one wanted us to leave the room.

1120
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:06,440
Rym: We could have stayed in there for three more hours and no one would have left the panel.

1121
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,893
Scott: I couldn't have stayed there for three more hours.

1122
01:03:07,913 --> 01:03:08,620
Scott: It was my disease.

1123
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,025
Rym: But the audience could have.

1124
01:03:10,267 --> 01:03:13,100
Rym: That panel was like, people fucking loved it.

1125
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,840
Scott: And then we took this bit that we had prepared for the Late Show.

1126
01:03:16,082 --> 01:03:18,420
Scott: that we didn't use at the Late Show because we ran out of time.

1127
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:26,840
Rym: I'm not going to say what it was because we're using this bit again at Otakon and then we sort of just hamfisted the bit into this unrelated panel just to kill time.

1128
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,139
Scott: And it totally worked.

1129
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,640
Rym: Yeah, you know, there's something good about when you finish your event.

1130
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,591
Rym: One, the best part is, is Nick, the T-1000 Robocop.

1131
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,506
Scott: Okay, I got to say this now, right?

1132
01:03:38,867 --> 01:03:42,100
Scott: Most of the time we go to conventions, big or small, right?

1133
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:50,799
Scott: You know, ConnectiCon, all they really did for us at ConnectiCon was they gave us an itinerary and they would check in on the panels a little bit, right?

1134
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:54,213
Scott: At Otakon, we have to check in with them.

1135
01:03:54,233 --> 01:03:55,880
Scott: We have to do our own panels.

1136
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,146
Scott: No one comes to help us.

1137
01:03:57,408 --> 01:03:59,520
Scott: The tech people, you can't even find them, really.

1138
01:04:00,623 --> 01:04:01,879
Rym: That'll probably change this year.

1139
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,659
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'm not saying it's the--.

1140
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,040
Rym: Well, no, there's a lot of news about panels at Otakon this year, but we'll talk about that next week.

1141
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:14,009
Scott: But the thing is, is that pretty much, as panelists at many conventions, the conventions don't help you out that much.

1142
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:16,440
Scott: They might not even make sure you run the panel.

1143
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,480
Scott: I've never even had anyone, like, really come and make sure that I was running the panel.

1144
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:29,620
Rym: Well, remember, the first three panels I ran at anime cons were literally the people who were supposed to run the panel weren't there, so I walked up to the front of the room, pretended I was them, and ran the panel.

1145
01:04:30,081 --> 01:04:30,563
Scott: Yup.

1146
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:50,520
Scott: At Kotacon, mostly thanks to Nick Ferris and his crew, you know, in the live events organization there at Kotacon, they were so checking up on us, making sure everything was working, making sure we had everything we needed, you know, coming into the panel room when there were five minutes left and holding up.

1147
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,420
Scott: They had the big number five written on an orange piece of paper on the back of all their binders.

1148
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,100
Rym: I gotta tell you, that dude, Nick Ferris, he would appear out of nowhere.

1149
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:03,839
Rym: Like, if you had a problem, like, you're standing in a room like, "All right, there might be too big a crowd, I need a problem with this,".

1150
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:05,449
Rym: it'd be like, "Zoop!

1151
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:06,556
Rym: Do you need any help,

1152
01:05:06,637 --> 01:05:06,858
Rym: Rin?".

1153
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:07,997
Scott: He just--.

1154
01:05:08,221 --> 01:05:10,340
Rym: This guy was, like, the badass of running con panels.

1155
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:14,140
Scott: Dude was everywhere, making sure everything was working just fine.

1156
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:21,440
Rym: And I just gotta say, the thing about Kotacon, dude actually was recognized for being a badass at the staff party by the senior staff.

1157
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,060
Scott: Oh, yeah, dude, total badass, total amazing.

1158
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:39,700
Scott: I mean, as a panelist, there is nothing that is better for you, that nothing you could appreciate more than the staff who are sort of handling the logistics of panels at the convention, sort of making sure your shit is good and checking up on you.

1159
01:05:39,841 --> 01:05:46,073
Scott: Even if you don't need anything, just them being there is like, "Ah, okay, shit's going right.

1160
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:48,759
Scott: You know you're in the right place, you know it's the right time, you know--".

1161
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:53,260
Scott: Just that reassurance is all you need, and they provided it more than any con ever.

1162
01:05:53,880 --> 01:06:01,740
Scott: But that event went crazily awesomely well, like standing ovation-- Surprisingly well, I wasn't expecting much out of it yet.

1163
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:05,439
Rym: I wouldn't be surprised if every single person in that room listens to GeekNights after that.

1164
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:05,812
Rym: Maybe.

1165
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,640
Scott: Because-- If they connected it to the GeekNights.

1166
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:13,100
Rym: Yeah, but, well, we gotta get a smaller banner, because our banner's a little too big to carry around.

1167
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:13,702
Scott: Yeah, get it.

1168
01:06:13,743 --> 01:06:14,649
Scott: We need a smaller one.

1169
01:06:14,689 --> 01:06:16,360
Scott: that's good for tables at the panels.

1170
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:17,000
Rym: Yes.

1171
01:06:17,342 --> 01:06:20,900
Rym: But then, later that day, we ran Challenger on Fire.

1172
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,380
Rym: This is our third attempt at running Challenger on Fire.

1173
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,180
Scott: I think we're retiring Challenger on Fire.

1174
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,480
Rym: I've got-- I think we can-- I think it can be pulled off.

1175
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:29,819
Scott: I don't think it's worth it.

1176
01:06:30,102 --> 01:06:31,000
Rym: I'm talking to Otakon.

1177
01:06:31,702 --> 01:06:33,420
Scott: I don't want to have it bomb at Otakon.

1178
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:37,560
Rym: No, I think it could, because the thing is, all it needs is one, it needs a very large audience.

1179
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,280
Scott: It does need-- it doesn't work without a large audience, that's true.

1180
01:06:40,943 --> 01:06:45,960
Rym: And with a large audience, pursuant to that, we would need-- I mean, we-- you know, we got, like, two guests from the con.

1181
01:06:46,580 --> 01:07:00,540
Rym: I realize now that what we actually need are, like, 20 guests from the con, and, like, 20 pre-selected con-goers who have taken a test to prove that they have the minimum skills it takes to be on this event.

1182
01:07:00,969 --> 01:07:01,120
Scott: Yep.

1183
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,580
Rym: This has to be, like, a main event's event, or it can't be done.

1184
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,400
Rym: But we've got all the technology together.

1185
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,259
Rym: The only thing we're lacking is a con that is willing to take a risk on giving us the full deal.

1186
01:07:13,123 --> 01:07:14,600
Rym: Because I think we can pull it off.

1187
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,360
Rym: We've learned everything you can learn about running this event.

1188
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:24,260
Scott: I think the biggest problem with this event is that the name, "Challenger on Fire," right, is that-- you know, that's what you have to get people to come to your event.

1189
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,119
Scott: Oh, we're renaming it.

1190
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,070
Scott: Yeah, I don't think people just-- you see "Challenger on Fire," they go, "What the fuck is

1191
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:29,191
Scott: that?"

1192
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:29,780
Scott: and they don't come.

1193
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,700
Scott: And I think-- Well, no, the sad thing is, actually-- Yeah, oh, that's true, that's right.

1194
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,916
Rym: "Challenger on Fire," no one came.

1195
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,012
Rym: We're like, "Ah,

1196
01:07:37,033 --> 01:07:37,237
Rym: shit.".

1197
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,860
Rym: But we ran it an hour early because of a rescheduling.

1198
01:07:42,362 --> 01:07:44,660
Rym: So we ran it to a very, very small audience.

1199
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,300
Rym: It was laid back.

1200
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:45,959
Rym: It was really fun.

1201
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,319
Rym: People enjoyed it, but it was not the event it should be.

1202
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,700
Rym: I consider it a failure.

1203
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,580
Rym: But right at the end-- All our friends showed up.

1204
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,460
Rym: Not just all our friends.

1205
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,500
Scott: And all our listeners.

1206
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:14,080
Rym: But, you know, all the people who had seen all our other panels and realized that the stuff we were doing was good, they all kind of came into the room expecting "Challenger on Fire," and we had to announce to all of you who came in, "Challenger on Fire" is now over because you didn't check the con errata and realize that we were rescheduled.

1207
01:08:14,782 --> 01:08:42,620
Scott: Yeah, I definitely think what we should do at cons, right, if we can somehow control our panel scheduling, right, I want to have early in the con, I want to run panels that'll get lots of people, right, then impress upon them that it's us doing these panels and let them know about the panels they're doing later, and later in the con do awesome panels, and those people, you know, we can sort of get them to attach to us and come to all of our events when they recognize that we're awesome.

1208
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,439
Scott: Because it already worked.

1209
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:49,399
Rym: I mean, the Gekiga panel, just because it was late at night, probably wouldn't have a lot of people, but-- It was super late at night.

1210
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:56,099
Scott: Almost everyone-- I literally was sick in bed, got up out of bed, walked to the Gekiga panel, walked back into bed.

1211
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:03,200
Rym: Almost everyone who went to that panel was someone who came because they had seen another one of our panels.

1212
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:06,000
Scott: And we had told them at that panel that we were doing the Gekiga panel.

1213
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:09,220
Rym: And let me tell you, that panel was amazing.

1214
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:24,211
Scott: Yeah, I don't know if we're going to do the Gekiga panel too many more times, I think it needs a little change-up, we're going to do something different, but that was actually not-- I was sick, I had just gotten out of bed and was going back to bed, I didn't say half the stuff.

1215
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:27,700
Scott: I usually say at the Gekiga panel, it was a pretty, you know, poor showing.

1216
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,500
Scott: Well, the thing is, considering how-- I think it was a success anyway.

1217
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,738
Rym: Oh, it went super well, the audience frickin' loved it.

1218
01:09:33,859 --> 01:09:40,078
Rym: And also, I would think that if we ran it again at Otakon, I think it would go over really well.

1219
01:09:40,984 --> 01:09:46,859
Rym: And I'm going to see about that, because-- I don't want to run it again at-- we already ran it at Otakon, Yes, however, it is very different now.

1220
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,660
Scott: Yeah, I think we should change it to something else at Otakon.

1221
01:09:50,779 --> 01:09:53,618
Scott: Maybe we should make it like a Sanctuary Only panel or something like that.

1222
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:54,867
Rym: Sanctuary?

1223
01:09:55,109 --> 01:09:55,452
Rym: We'll see.

1224
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:01,120
Rym: But suffice to say, we ran the Gekiga panel, and it was super, super awesome.

1225
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:03,220
Scott: Yeah, now I gotta mention this, right?

1226
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,980
Scott: There was a guy-- when we were at the Animation C panel, right?

1227
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,059
Scott: We thought, you know, we didn't know where we were going with that panel, it was kind of freeform, right?

1228
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:20,520
Scott: So we were thinking, "Hey, what we'll do is we'll bring people up, we'll ask them what shows they've seen and what shows they like, and then we'll tell them what shows are good for them to see that they haven't seen.

1229
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,276
Scott: And we'll just do that to a bunch of people, and that'll be what we'll do,

1230
01:10:23,337 --> 01:10:23,518
Scott: right?".

1231
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:27,380
Scott: Well, we brought up one guy, this bearded guy-- Totally randomly.

1232
01:10:28,122 --> 01:10:29,797
Scott: Rym was like, "We need a guinea

1233
01:10:29,817 --> 01:10:30,039
Scott: pig.".

1234
01:10:30,361 --> 01:10:32,560
Scott: A bunch of people raised their hands, Rym picked Bearded Guy.

1235
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,492
Rym: I was like, "Uh,

1236
01:10:33,532 --> 01:10:33,633
Rym: you.".

1237
01:10:34,242 --> 01:10:34,980
Scott: You, Bearded Guy.

1238
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:36,600
Rym: Alright, Bearded Guy, I forget your name.

1239
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,738
Rym: You were pretty damn cool and knew--.

1240
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,592
Scott: Let me tell you how cool Bearded Guy was, sorry.

1241
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,440
Rym: One Bearded Guy had seen all the anime that's worth seeing already.

1242
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:46,528
Scott: Right, right, right.

1243
01:10:46,589 --> 01:10:47,740
Scott: Let me tell you, alright?

1244
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:48,959
Scott: Oh my god.

1245
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,579
Scott: First of all, sorry Bearded Guy, I don't know your name, and you'll have to email it to us.

1246
01:10:53,902 --> 01:10:54,979
Scott: I know you're listening, by the way.

1247
01:10:55,921 --> 01:11:03,380
Scott: Bearded Guy comes up, we talk to him just a little bit, and that sets off the Anime You Should See panel, and we don't need any other guinea pigs because he's so awesome, right?

1248
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,796
Rym: Of course, we're like, "What kind of shows do you

1249
01:11:04,837 --> 01:11:05,039
Rym: watch?"

1250
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,560
Rym: Expecting, you know, some fan to say, "I watch Bleach," or whatever.

1251
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:11,200
Rym: Any names have the shows that we were going to talk about.

1252
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:11,641
Scott: Right.

1253
01:11:12,124 --> 01:11:14,720
Scott: Secondly, the guy comes to the Gekiga panel, right?

1254
01:11:15,101 --> 01:11:18,880
Scott: At the Gekiga panel, I mentioned the Will Eisner, of course, as you must, right?

1255
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:26,520
Rym: Because, you know, we're talking about, like-- We're talking about the god of Japanese comics, and then-- Like, Gekiga was to manga what graphic novel is to comic.

1256
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:27,625
Scott: Sort of, in a way.

1257
01:11:27,968 --> 01:11:32,018
Scott: But, you know, and he asked, like, "Was this sort of like, you know, the R. Crumb

1258
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:32,200
Scott: deal?".

1259
01:11:32,261 --> 01:11:33,597
Scott: And I'm like, "Yes, it's sort of like

1260
01:11:33,637 --> 01:11:33,799
Scott: that.".

1261
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,907
Scott: But he knew the deal.

1262
01:11:35,109 --> 01:11:40,440
Scott: And, when I mentioned Will Eisner, he threw at us a button with a spirit on it.

1263
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,328
Scott: And I'm like, "What the fuck?

1264
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:45,538
Scott: Who in an anime convention has a button with a spirit on it, other than a cool

1265
01:11:45,578 --> 01:11:45,840
Scott: person?".

1266
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,470
Rym: Other than Bearded Guy.

1267
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:49,020
Rym: So, Bearded Guy, my hat is off to you.

1268
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,700
Scott: Bearded Guy had friends, too, right?

1269
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,000
Scott: And they were all pretty cool.

1270
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,720
Scott: Bearded Guy is even more awesome.

1271
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,319
Scott: You ready for how awesome Bearded Guy is?

1272
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,500
Scott: Okay, so Bearded Guy, I'm talking to him after the Gekiga panel.

1273
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,979
Scott: Still, I'm about to go-- I'm basically at the stairs, ready to go back to the room and go to bed.

1274
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:06,860
Scott: And he's telling me how he has a cyber cafe.

1275
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,360
Scott: He owns a cyber cafe in Virginia somewhere.

1276
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:15,300
Scott: And he plays GeekNights on the radio in the cyber cafe every night.

1277
01:12:15,761 --> 01:12:16,565
Scott: How awesome is that?

1278
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:19,140
Scott: So, hello, cyber cafe people in Virginia.

1279
01:12:19,364 --> 01:12:19,598
Scott: Yes.

1280
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:20,297
Scott: What's up?

1281
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:24,970
Scott: I think-- Look at Bearded Guy, who's over probably by the counter making coffee or whatever.

1282
01:12:25,151 --> 01:12:25,917
Scott: That's Bearded Guy.

1283
01:12:25,957 --> 01:12:26,360
Scott: He's cool.

1284
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,480
Rym: Now, Bearded Guy, I think we want to get him on the show.

1285
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,378
Rym: I just want to talk to him.

1286
01:12:30,669 --> 01:12:30,860
Scott: Yeah.

1287
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,220
Rym: Maybe as a guest host, even.

1288
01:12:32,901 --> 01:12:34,279
Scott: Guys, guys, way cool dude.

1289
01:12:35,529 --> 01:12:35,859
Scott: I don't know.

1290
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:36,441
Scott: Knows.

1291
01:12:36,461 --> 01:12:42,180
Scott: Will Eisner goes to KazuKan, comes to our panels, has cyber cafe, plays GeekNights at cyber cafe.

1292
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:45,340
Rym: Has the spirit pin cocked, loaded, and ready to throw.

1293
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,520
Scott: Yeah, it had more of them.

1294
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:47,576
Scott: I was like, "Do you want this

1295
01:12:47,617 --> 01:12:47,780
Scott: back?".

1296
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,549
Scott: And he's like, "No, I got

1297
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:48,995
Scott: more.".

1298
01:12:49,015 --> 01:12:49,400
Scott: All right.

1299
01:12:50,382 --> 01:12:51,578
Scott: Doesn't get much cooler than that.

1300
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,087
Rym: All right, I hate to say this.

1301
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:55,999
Rym: We've gone long a bit, I think.

1302
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,090
Scott: Quite long.

1303
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:03,960
Rym: So, I think what we're going to do is this weekend, we're going to finish our KazuKan coverage and put it up in the Wednesday feed.

1304
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:09,480
Rym: Because Scott's still coughing, we all still have a lingering sickness, and my Swiss steaks are almost done.

1305
01:13:10,183 --> 01:13:11,299
Scott: All right, we haven't eaten dinner yet.

1306
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:14,119
Rym: I have not even talked about half of what I have to say for KazuKan.

1307
01:13:14,481 --> 01:13:17,120
Scott: I don't really have that much more to say, because I was sick in bed most of the time.

1308
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,479
Rym: Well, I went around the con and did stuff.

1309
01:13:18,722 --> 01:13:20,920
Scott: I can talk about the dealer's room and the artist's alley, I guess.

1310
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,100
Rym: So, wow, we pretty much reviewed GeekNights at KazuKan.

1311
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:24,352
Rym: Yep.

1312
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:25,306
Rym: Stay tuned.

1313
01:13:25,589 --> 01:13:30,840
Rym: At some point this week, we will continue with another good hour of KazuKan coverage for KazuKan.

1314
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,380
Scott: All right, but next Wednesday, I think we should return to Anime Manga Comics.

1315
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:34,801
Scott: Yes.

1316
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:37,980
Rym: Also, there's a lot of news about Otakon I really got to talk about.

1317
01:13:38,506 --> 01:13:38,877
Scott: Good news.

1318
01:13:39,021 --> 01:13:40,220
Scott: That is your news next Wednesday.

1319
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,559
Rym: All good news.

1320
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:46,880
Rym: Otakon is moving in a direction that is, ah, I cannot express to you how happy I am with Otakon right now.

1321
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,100
Scott: Well, that'll be your news next Wednesday.

1322
01:13:48,242 --> 01:13:49,400
Rym: But I have one last thing to say.

1323
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,519
Rym: We'll talk about this again later in the week and next week.

1324
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:55,720
Rym: If you went to KazuKan, go to the KazuKan website.

1325
01:13:56,122 --> 01:13:59,060
Rym: On the front of the KazuKan website, there's a KazuKan 14.

1326
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,180
Scott: We should have said this at the beginning of the show.

1327
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,699
Rym: But I'll say it again in the next show.

1328
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,420
Rym: A KazuKan 14 attendee survey.

1329
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:08,040
Rym: Now, every con should have this exact survey.

1330
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,360
Rym: This is like the best convention survey ever.

1331
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,100
Scott: Technologically and survey-wise.

1332
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,380
Rym: They ask the right questions.

1333
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:18,440
Rym: So if you were at KazuKan, fill this survey out.

1334
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:18,956
Scott: Fill it out?

1335
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:19,579
Scott: Honestly.

1336
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,218
Scott: Honestly fill it out.

1337
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,200
Rym: Because they, all this can do is make KazuKan a better con.

1338
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:25,915
Rym: Yep.

1339
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:30,720
Rym: And I'll point out that I asked for Kazu Koike and Ryuichi Ikigami to be guests.

1340
01:14:31,081 --> 01:14:31,374
Scott: Me too.

1341
01:14:38,091 --> 01:14:40,210
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1344
01:14:55,350 --> 01:15:00,950
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1345
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:03,049
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1346

Scott: This means you can do whatever you want with it, as long as you give us credit, don't make money, and share it in kind.

1356
01:15:46,474 --> 01:15:49,950
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1357
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:53,490
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
