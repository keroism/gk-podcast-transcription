4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:34,438
Rym: You know there's really one bad thing about spending the weekend at the beach.

6
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:34,819
Rym: is that I?

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:43,880
Rym: Once I spend a few days not at the beach I once again get to that point in my life where I decide wait a minute Why don't I just go live at the beach?

8
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:48,659
Rym: I could afford it get some crap job and just be a beach bomb the rest of my life.

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,808
Scott: Beach bum is on the list.

10
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:55,560
Scott: It's actually relatively high on the list of you know careers.

11
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:59,360
Scott: I mean Beach bum is a non paying job.

12
00:00:59,502 --> 00:01:02,145
Scott: It pays nothing yet It is above.

13
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:04,592
Scott: and in my list of jobs you know sort of like.

14
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:09,049
Scott: you know like safety jobs like if I fail at this Job, I'll go down to this job.

15
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:09,651
Scott: I fail at that.

16
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:10,134
Scott: I go down.

17
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:10,837
Rym: It's like for us.

18
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:11,440
Rym: It's it.

19
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:18,049
Scott: entertainment underwater welding Underwater welding I was about to mention and then Beach bum.

20
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,400
Scott: and you know Beach bum comes above many paying position.

21
00:01:21,522 --> 00:01:22,340
Rym: He's thinking about that life.

22
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,620
Rym: I live that life for a short time when I would meet after RIT and all that co-op and business.

23
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:32,420
Rym: Me and Scott went to with Scott Johnson down to his beach house, then I lived there for a while.

24
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,020
Rym: You know what I could deal with that life.

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,904
Scott: I could well deal deal with that life when you don't have the House.

26
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:44,226
Rym: the thing is you just live in a shithole near the beach And you sleep in a lot of places.

27
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,672
Rym: those people to sleep on the beach.

28
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:47,660
Scott: the thing is they have a beach patrol.

29
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,960
Rym: Yeah, well I wouldn't live in if I was a beach bum.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,168
Rym: I wouldn't go to Wildwood if I were to be.

31
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:52,991
Scott: should you go to?

32
00:01:53,232 --> 00:01:59,591
Rym: you got to California one of those crap where they have Beach Patrol a lot of places you can be on the beach at night.

33
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:00,695
Scott: Yeah, you know where.

34
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:05,213
Scott: Cuba Cuba You can live on the beach and not just Cuba besides.

35
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:06,940
Rym: There's different levels of Beach bum.

36
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,321
Rym: I mean.

37
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:08,466
Rym: are we talking about?

38
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:15,342
Rym: I have no money and no job and in basically a hobo Beach hobo Only.

39
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:17,789
Scott: the difference is hobos like do things like.

40
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:24,071
Scott: they're hobos that like run pirate radio stations and hobos also Travel bums tend to not travel.

41
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,320
Scott: they work less and they drink more.

42
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:29,304
Scott: Hobos travel more.

43
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:40,240
Scott: they work more, but they don't really make money, but they sort of do things and Hobos are saying you could look at a hobo some hobos.

44
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:49,780
Rym: I read an article a couple years ago about this Emerging class of hobo by choice 20-somethings who just quit college and just kind of bum around.

45
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:53,680
Scott: Yeah, it's like this homeless people that go to libraries and write blogs.

46
00:02:53,861 --> 00:03:01,073
Scott: You know they spend a lot of time in libraries or beaches or other public places And you know it's all kinds of homeless action.

47
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:02,760
Rym: No there's different levels of Beach bum.

48
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:05,540
Rym: I mean the level I'd look at the level that's high on the list.

49
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:09,156
Rym: Beach hobo is very low on my list.

50
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:11,424
Rym: I would be Campus hobo before.

51
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:12,188
Rym: I'd be Beach hobo.

52
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,397
Scott: I'd be Beach hobo before college.

53
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:15,220
Rym: can't think about it.

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,113
Rym: Go to RIT right college campus hobo of course.

55
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:25,600
Rym: They probably cleaned it up now back in the day There were showers bathrooms and all sorts of stuff in those tunnels that no one else no one ever went down there.

56
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,608
Rym: You could pretty much live down there if you wanted to.

57
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:29,636
Scott: so you know actually I was in Florida.

58
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:30,058
Scott: right?

59
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:32,888
Scott: the hospitals They're like you would want.

60
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:35,217
Scott: they had this on the front desk of the hospital.

61
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:37,459
Scott: when you walk in There's like this ball of stickers.

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,705
Scott: They're the guest stickers.

63
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:46,639
Scott: cuz like you go in you they give you a sticker says guest in your name or whatever and then when you leave they take the sticker, and they make a ball out of it as a big ball.

64
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:51,740
Scott: and I walk in like grandma, and she just keeps walking right past the desk doesn't stop.

65
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:54,469
Scott: We didn't get any stickers and no one cared.

66
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:55,473
Scott: no one looked at us.

67
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:58,245
Scott: We walked right into whatever room We wanted to.

68
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:00,400
Scott: no one said anything no one cared.

69
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:05,780
Scott: You could just totally go in the hospital free like just walk right in from the street and do whatever you wanted.

70
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,780
Scott: No one would stop you or talk to you or anything.

71
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:13,297
Scott: You could totally just walk in and find an empty bed and now probably order food.

72
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:14,020
Rym: that wouldn't work.

73
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,040
Rym: You could probably get food But yeah.

74
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,966
Rym: And you could probably find somewhere dank to sleep because most hospitals have a whole bunch of like side Infrastructure tunnels and things.

75
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:26,160
Scott: you go to an empty an empty room, and there's no one in there.

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,580
Rym: Realize that in pretty much every metropolitan area finding an empty bed in a hospital is pretty much impossible.

77
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:37,050
Scott: Okay, but you know in the hospital.

78
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,500
Scott: I was in in Florida like half the beds are empty.

79
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:41,065
Rym: What kind of hospital was it?

80
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:42,530
Scott: It was a normal hospital.

81
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,855
Scott: Just completely normal.

82
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:44,959
Rym: What do you mean completely normal?

83
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,660
Scott: I had an emergency room section, and I had a you know staying overnight.

84
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,871
Rym: I realize asking you what kind of hospital is okay.

85
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:55,135
Rym: It's like a hospital.

86
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,713
Rym: It's like asking a non-computer guy Yeah, do you have a risk kernel or a cis kernel?

87
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:01,120
Scott: There was no specialist.

88
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:10,839
Rym: It was better off going to a college campus because I would have a hard time Differentiating a lot of hobos from a lot of the people I knew at RIT.

89
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:17,000
Rym: I guess that's true especially considering that half the people we hung out with at RIT We're not students.

90
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:21,355
Rym: We're well over 25 and just happen to live in the area again.

91
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:24,202
Scott: if you get one of those hospital gowns You're you're.

92
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:28,157
Scott: if you can just get the gown on then they'll be like where did this patient come from?

93
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:31,808
Scott: and they won't be able Identify you and they'll freak out and something will happen.

94
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,192
Rym: I know what'll happen.

95
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:40,075
Scott: it involves police, but hey hey I wonder what the sentence is for faking hospital stay.

96
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:41,220
Rym: I don't know.

97
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,357
Rym: I think if you're faking the hospital stay you've got more things to worry about.

98
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:50,932
Scott: wait well They send you perhaps to the psych ward of the hospital Which is where you're trying to get in the psych ward of the hospital.

99
00:05:51,013 --> 00:05:51,475
Scott: Why not?

100
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:52,017
Scott: I've been.

101
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:53,987
Scott: no I just come in.

102
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:54,891
Scott: they'd be like are you insane?

103
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:55,816
Scott: I'd be like yes.

104
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:58,147
Scott: I want to bed And I'll be crazy.

105
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,060
Scott: I'll pretend I'm crazy and I'll just get to stay in the bed.

106
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:01,750
Rym: I've been in those psych wards.

107
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,560
Rym: you do not want to be in those place.

108
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,971
Scott: Yeah, everyone else is crazy, but I'm in my own room.

109
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:06,775
Rym: No you're not.

110
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:07,779
Rym: you don't get a private room.

111
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:10,194
Rym: Why not you share with other crazy people?

112
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,060
Scott: That's not fair.

113
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,422
Scott: What then?

114
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:13,593
Scott: how do they expect crazy people to get uncrazy?

115
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:14,840
Scott: they put him with crazy don't?

116
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:19,160
Scott: Why they got to separate the crazies or else they're gonna be more crazy.

117
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,480
Rym: It's a complicated issue, but all I will say is the four Crazy more crazy.

118
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:28,880
Rym: No, it's like when you multiply two even numbers and two odd.

119
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:32,795
Scott: Yes, you got to put each crazy person on the road or else.

120
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:34,060
Scott: They will not be un-crazy.

121
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:46,020
Rym: But the one time that way I can pretend to be crazy and get a bed I got you know I had I had the gigantic I am NOT crazy armband that is not removable from me so that I could get out of this place.

122
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:50,188
Rym: I get in there and I find the network closet And you know I don't really see anyone around.

123
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:51,212
Rym: so I open the network closet.

124
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:53,100
Scott: I go in and I'm this crazy guy in there.

125
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:57,834
Rym: God you know I found some scary shit in network closets sometimes.

126
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:01,382
Scott: I'm glad I'm sorry cough a guy Baz.

127
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:05,034
Rym: really I did open one once and find some guy asleep in it.

128
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:06,700
Scott: was he a technician?

129
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:08,526
Rym: No, I don't know who he was.

130
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:13,100
Rym: all I remember is I quietly went in did my business and just shut the door behind me.

131
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,113
Scott: He didn't say anything now.

132
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:17,084
Scott: You should have poked him with a stick I didn't want to deal with.

133
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:19,173
Scott: that should have thrown the bas really bad.

134
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:20,117
Rym: I really didn't care.

135
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:25,746
Rym: But no, so I'm working on this switch And I feel a little airy sure wasn't a mummy?

136
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:31,750
Rym: I turn around and there is a semicircle of like 11 of these people Just staring at me outside the door.

137
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,240
Rym: I'm completely trapped and surrounded.

138
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,494
Scott: Why did they let the crazed people walk around?

139
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:37,520
Rym: they just wander the halls?

140
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,459
Rym: Why it depends on what kind of psych ward it is yeah?

141
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,906
Rym: So they're all kind of standing around.

142
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:44,710
Scott: I know you were there.

143
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,840
Scott: They should have put them in their not hallway.

144
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:48,625
Rym: They didn't don't care?

145
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:58,766
Rym: the people who run the psych ward like hey have fun, and then they locked me in great I had to go to the airlock to get back up, but anyway When I when I say beach bum I mean

146
00:07:59,067 --> 00:07:59,708
Scott: go live

147
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,957
Rym: cheaply right near a pretty much a year-round beach.

148
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:03,840
Scott: the problem is beach.

149
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:06,154
Scott: Closed property is stupidly expensive.

150
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:11,754
Rym: not always What you can live near beaches in really dumpy crappy places.

151
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:15,317
Rym: often you'll be living semi illegally Semi illegally is okay.

152
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:23,000
Rym: Yeah Like you live you work it like say a bar near the beach And then you agree to pay some pittance to be able to sleep in the bar when it's closed at night.

153
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:27,846
Scott: Or you can just you know sleep in The hospital or you could.

154
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:30,916
Scott: what's that guy who would get drunk ever and arrested every night?

155
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:30,977
Scott: Oh?

156
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,823
Rym: What's his name?

157
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:34,188
Rym: the hero of FARC?

158
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,672
Scott: Yes?

159
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:35,817
Rym: I forgot his name.

160
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:49,100
Scott: Ah Just get every night Just get stupidly drunk and from the money you begged or danced or sang for and then get arrested I would leave another Sleep in the local jail, and then they let you in the morning.

161
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,382
Rym: That's a level below the kind of beach bum I want to be.

162
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:52,025
Rym: that I'm.

163
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:54,996
Rym: what I would do is live cheaply like in a bar.

164
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:59,028
Scott: What's cheaper than Free bed at the local jail.

165
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:05,340
Rym: I would rather have my freedom and just sleep in the bar You only lose your freedom at night.

166
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,885
Rym: No, that's not how that works.

167
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,891
Scott: you go into the police station.

168
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,436
Scott: It's not like the big jail.

169
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:12,906
Scott: Yeah, it's it's you know It's like all right.

170
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:13,530
Scott: We like you up.

171
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,113
Scott: Okay.

172
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:14,877
Rym: It's crazy.

173
00:09:14,897 --> 00:09:15,380
Rym: It wouldn't work.

174
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,831
Scott: The old TV show what's it called with Barney Fife?

175
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:22,597
Rym: Oh the Andy Griffith show.

176
00:09:22,637 --> 00:09:23,359
Scott: yeah, just like that.

177
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:26,637
Scott: That's what it'd be like.

178
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:30,020
Scott: they'd like you up, and there's the drug It would get.

179
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:31,009
Scott: he got locked up.

180
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:34,385
Scott: It would be exactly like that all right fine.

181
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:35,109
Rym: Here's the deal.

182
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:39,230
Rym: Next week we'll both go out to Southern, California.

183
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,610
Rym: Somewhere you get arrested every night.

184
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:46,508
Rym: I will find a job at a bar and see if I can crash there after they close.

185
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:50,430
Scott: well You'll get the job at the bars that you can provide me with the alcohol to get arrested.

186
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:55,690
Rym: I will provide you with as much alcohol as you want yeah, and I'll just give it to like some kid.

187
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,150
Scott: I'll get her go to jail for one night, and then I'll be let out.

188
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:00,797
Rym: We'll see how that works.

189
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:01,582
Scott: I'm not gonna drink it.

190
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:02,790
Scott: You know, but you could drink it.

191
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:13,317
Scott: Oh Actually that would actually if you got the job at the bar and just drank the alcohol that would get you in jail for the Night, no it wouldn't why not They're not?

192
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,329
Rym: they really won't jail you unless you're driving drunk.

193
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,037
Scott: Oh, I just want to be.

194
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,568
Scott: not just being really drunk in public doesn't do it.

195
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:21,418
Rym: I depends on the place.

196
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,550
Scott: vomiting in the I go to the playground.

197
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:25,299
Scott: That's a good place.

198
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,979
Rym: I Try not gonna work besides.

199
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,889
Rym: I would rather just have a job.

200
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:31,794
Rym: That's the whole point.

201
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:31,994
Scott: then.

202
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:32,978
Scott: you're not a bum.

203
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:34,403
Rym: yes, I'm a beach bum.

204
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,370
Rym: beach bum is a very specific thing.

205
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,799
Scott: That is nothing to do with bombs.

206
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,101
Scott: No.

207
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,470
Scott: It's very a lot to do with bum.

208
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,544
Rym: No, because there are beach bums, which are actually above Beach Hobo.

209
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:43,449
Rym: I'm talking about dude.

210
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,875
Scott: That's just a surfer, dude.

211
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:50,190
Rym: No you can be a dude beach bum - the only difference is you don't have a future.

212
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:51,466
Scott: You need a surfboard.

213
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:52,855
Rym: They're cheap.

214
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:53,819
Scott: No really.

215
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,804
Rym: I'll learn to have their cheese.

216
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:55,125
Scott: There's new.

217
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:55,387
Scott: the new.

218
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,090
Scott: there were good ones.

219
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:57,989
Scott: Have a good one.

220
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,579
Rym: Okay, I wouldn't surf in once I fell over.

221
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,109
Scott: it was the end of that because you see that crappy surfboard.

222
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,110
Rym: No, I didn't know how to surf, and I didn't get a lesson.

223
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,423
Rym: I rented a surfboard in Florida my all.

224
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:15,630
Rym: I well rented surfboards And I went out and I didn't know what I was doing and I stood up on it twice.

225
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:19,410
Scott: I'll just get the you know the ski do and cut your surfboard in half and go.

226
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,861
Rym: Beach bums can't afford see dudes.

227
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,250
Scott: I didn't say I'd be a beach bum.

228
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:32,880
Rym: I just I feel like I want to be a beach bum because I'll see you go Wake up right every other day.

229
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,699
Rym: Go to the beach fall asleep wake up again Go swimming come back to the beach.

230
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:41,630
Scott: You know what I see in the future life of the beach bum.

231
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:43,162
Scott: Skin cancer.

232
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,121
Rym: you know what I see Sunscreens not that expensive.

233
00:11:46,282 --> 00:11:47,469
Scott: also winter.

234
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,704
Rym: Let's go to Southern California where it's always 76 degrees.

235
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:55,643
Scott: Anyway, I think we've run the course of this discussion.

236
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:57,210
Rym: this discussion didn't really go anyway.

237
00:11:57,937 --> 00:11:58,865
Rym: I can't say one thing though.

238
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:03,187
Rym: at the beach I for various reasons bought the SPF 15 instead of the SPF 30. why?

239
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,264
Rym: Because I kind of wanted to tan as opposed to just not burning.

240
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:11,069
Scott: Yeah, I don't really care about tan I care about not skin cancer.

241
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:16,672
Rym: You know what it worked real well and actually using that sunscreen as opposed to all the other ones I've used.

242
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:20,149
Rym: this is the first time I've ever gone to Wildwood and come back without a sunburn.

243
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:21,542
Rym: Uh-huh first time ever.

244
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:31,670
Scott: Yeah, usually only get sunburn You know from not applying often enough or not applying to every spot or that sort of or they always the last day.

245
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,079
Rym: Let's go to the beach real quick before we get on the road.

246
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:35,545
Rym: Yeah, we don't need sunscreen.

247
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:36,348
Rym: I'm not gonna burn.

248
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:37,817
Rym: ah shit We're all burn now.

249
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,490
Scott: It really has nothing to do with the SPF's.

250
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:44,712
Rym: Well the one thing I noticed though is I put it on a lot more because it was the SPF 15.

251
00:12:44,712 --> 00:12:46,233
Rym: So I kept putting it on That.

252
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:47,360
Scott: that's definitely what it is.

253
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,050
Rym: then you got at the same time.

254
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:54,212
Scott: I tended to put it on once a day and then late in the day would be worn off because it only lasts a few Hours.

255
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,610
Rym: it always avoid put lazy to keep putting it back on because I actually wanted to tan a little bit.

256
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,452
Rym: So I'd be really hard to not just burn but now with the 15 or the 4 or the whatever I'll.

257
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,430
Rym: I'll just kind of slowly tan the whole weekend.

258
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:14,215
Scott: Yeah, anyway, I definitely I got a shop around because there was that study that said you know don't stop using sunscreen But you know different.

259
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,644
Scott: well, you know, they're not as effective as you thought they were.

260
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:19,716
Scott: and then they're like there's this chemical That's in the sunscreen.

261
00:13:19,776 --> 00:13:21,141
Scott: It's not sold in the United States.

262
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:22,465
Scott: That supposedly is amazing.

263
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:23,690
Scott: Well, we haven't verified that.

264
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:35,041
Scott: I haven't verified that I'm saying supposedly supposedly Because I read something like last year that said some chemical is used in all the sunscreens and all the world Except in the United States because it's not FDA approved.

265
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:39,620
Scott: Yeah, and it's super amazing and awesome And we just don't use it here because we're stupid or something like.

266
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,051
Rym: there's also the the scam of SPF 90.

267
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:49,597
Scott: Yeah, it's just stupid also, so I'm gonna do a lot of research and figure out the best Suntan lotion sunscreen, whatever.

268
00:13:49,737 --> 00:14:00,230
Scott: Well sunscreen and suntan lotion and sunblock are three different things I know but I'm gonna buy pretty much the best one of those that my research Tells me to and then I'll buy a big one and then use that.

269
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:10,576
Rym: You know, it's such a shame because on one hand one quarter of my family has a history of skin cancer But on the other hand, I really like laying in the Sun Like it might.

270
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:20,150
Rym: maybe you know, there might be some sort of genetic correlation because Maybe my desire to lay in the Sun is what caused relatives of the past my ancestors to all die of skin cancer.

271
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:25,860
Scott: Yeah, I think I'm also next time I go to a doctor I'm gonna have them check out all of my mole freckle things.

272
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,863
Scott: just you know, why not?

273
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:28,569
Rym: Yeah, you're more moly than me.

274
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:29,681
Scott: Yeah, I got like.

275
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:34,725
Scott: I got one on my neck I got one on the back and I got the one on my upper left chest.

276
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:36,190
Scott: that's been there for like a thousand years.

277
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:41,052
Rym: See one thing I've always been happy about I've got very few moles and the ones I do are very very small and but Not like.

278
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,608
Rym: the biggest one I've got is like half the size of an eraser.

279
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,050
Scott: Yeah, that's you know, I got eraser.

280
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:49,789
Scott: Yeah, the one on my neck is about that big.

281
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:50,759
Rym: Yeah.

282
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:54,884
Rym: Anyway, well that was talking about nothing.

283
00:14:54,905 --> 00:15:00,346
Rym: That's what you get for Thursdays Especially when we're tired and Scott's whining because I turned off my air conditioner.

284
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,230
Scott: It's a little hot in here.

285
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,126
Scott: Do you want to talk about the all the conventions and stuff for you still do that?

286
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:04,669
Rym: I guess we could.

287
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:12,585
Rym: you know it's Thursday, so it's kind of the night which is kind of weird because a Lot of people listen to like Tuesday and Wednesday like together.

288
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,970
Rym: a lot of people listen to the whole show But a lot of people listen to just Thursday.

289
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:19,929
Rym: So you guys miss out on a lot of the kind of other things we talked about.

290
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:26,664
Rym: So news wise I just kind of want to point out that for the month of August We're going to be doing live shows all over the place.

291
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:37,124
Rym: So if you wanted to meet us August and then one weekend in September are pretty much your best bets Yeah, so in the month of August in the very first weekend of August which weekend is that?

292
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:38,688
Scott: was that the third?

293
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:44,815
Scott: I think the first weekend in August I'll get the calendar for you in a later show is Connecticut.

294
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:52,350
Scott: Friday Saturday Sunday in the first Connecticut in the Hartford Convention Center, it's it's the only could be convention center.

295
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:55,748
Rym: We are going to be there all weekend doing.

296
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,936
Rym: god I can't I don't even.

297
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:04,970
Rym: actually we haven't got the finalists yet But we're going to be doing a ton of live shows on Saturday and on Sunday, we're gonna be running games.

298
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,849
Rym: We're gonna be running some burning wheel.

299
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:15,583
Rym: We're gonna be running some like teach and then play sessions with some of the more hardcore board games Where we'll act as a wicked awesome gaming room at ConnectiCon.

300
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:22,130
Scott: and even when we're not in there We have some front row crew associates who will be in there rocking games from pretty much the entire con.

301
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:26,823
Rym: So if you like anime or video games or web comics any of those three

302
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:37,870
Scott: or even video games or you know I mean, there's a miniatures gaming room in there and I swear There's like the same old guys every year go in there and play like a miniatures war for like the whole weekend.

303
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:40,681
Rym: I really like ConnectiCon because it's not really an anime con.

304
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:43,648
Rym: It's just a geek con straight up and it doesn't really pretend to be Anything else?

305
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:54,250
Scott: Yeah it's got a little bit of anime styling like on the face of it and I guess the majority of the crowd is sort of like the anime con ish fan crowd, but it's not really a big con.

306
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,190
Scott: It's sort of like just the right size.

307
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:01,210
Scott: You can be comfortable and most of the merchandise in the dealer's room is anime con type merchandise.

308
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:02,596
Scott: But you know, it's.

309
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:05,470
Scott: it's got some comic book action going on.

310
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:08,564
Scott: It's got gaming heart really awesome game room was.

311
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:09,890
Rym: ConnectiCon is really cool in that.

312
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,222
Rym: That's the con where they really pretty much they.

313
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,869
Rym: let us test new events there.

314
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:18,126
Rym: So when we're gonna do a new live show like we come up with hey What do we do a panel about Semprene?

315
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:27,950
Rym: All right Well, let's put it together and then we do it always for a test audience at ConnectiCon And that's kind of the place where they really let us play around with like formats of things and it's worked really well for us.

316
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:32,330
Scott: Yeah, it's it's you know, cuz it's so small and such It's really easy to you know.

317
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,083
Scott: sort of have our run of the place and then like kind of.

318
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:43,841
Rym: the example I would give is if you see it like One of our live shows that Otakon or Penny Arcade Expo or any of those like Baker katsu con They're kind of chair facing forward.

319
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:44,845
Rym: We give a talk.

320
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:46,852
Rym: We teach you something We do something.

321
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:48,397
Rym: ConnectiCon is the.

322
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:52,170
Rym: we're sitting backwards in the chairs kind of just chilling and talking with our crowd.

323
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:54,439
Rym: Yep, like hey, so we're talking about this.

324
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:55,524
Rym: What do you guys think about this?

325
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:56,970
Rym: What would make this bla bla bla bla?

326
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,535
Rym: Hey great to hear from you.

327
00:17:58,735 --> 00:17:59,719
Rym: Hmm.

328
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:05,299
Scott: So the weekend after ConnectiCon the second weekend in August is the Otakon.

329
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:06,148
Scott: Otakon.

330
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:10,307
Rym: Otakon is pretty much the best anime convention in America.

331
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:13,919
Scott: Yep Been to it for the past six or seven years.

332
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:16,088
Rym: Yeah, I've paid for one Otakon.

333
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:17,616
Rym: good god We've been doing panels there.

334
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:20,070
Scott: I think I've paid for two or three, but that's about it.

335
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,788
Rym: Yeah, cuz you didn't jump in on that anime club summit action as quickly as I did not really my bag.

336
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,870
Rym: But yeah, well that was my first foray into doing panels with those club summits back in the day.

337
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:38,730
Rym: But Otakon we're actually doing two panels this year Which is kind of cool because they denied a lot of people panels and yet they gave us two because we're awesome.

338
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,089
Rym: Yeah, well being panelists for every figure but we're talking about.

339
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:44,779
Scott: Well, should we reveal what we're talking about?

340
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,502
Rym: Yeah, why not?

341
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:46,025
Rym: All right.

342
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:47,130
Rym: What are our panels?

343
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:48,827
Scott: one of the panels.

344
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,970
Scott: One of the panels is the panel I've wanted to do for a long time.

345
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:04,030
Rym: but look we're doing know your creator exactly where we talk about like people who create anime and manga and Studios and directors and composers and all these things.

346
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,730
Scott: We're not really gonna go in-depth in any particular creators.

347
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,267
Scott: The idea is that a lot of you know people out there who are anime fans.

348
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:12,110
Scott: manga fans.

349
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:16,110
Scott: They don't pay attention to who makes their anime to who makes their manga.

350
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,840
Scott: They couldn't tell you, you know, they could name maybe three anime directors.

351
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:33,929
Scott: They could name maybe you know, three manga artists Whereas, you know, they could tell you if they'd also like movies or you know American live-action movies or books or they could tell you directs all of them or they could tell you all the actors are.

352
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:34,953
Scott: they could Everything.

353
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:37,181
Scott: so how come not with the anime and the manga?

354
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,570
Scott: so is to encourage people to pay attention to that.

355
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,349
Scott: We're gonna do a panel sort of telling them who all the big names are.

356
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:48,290
Rym: I mean think of this when we like, you know, we're big in the anime convention stuff and anime podcasting.

357
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:57,970
Rym: But when I first met Daryl Surratt over an anime world order when I was slightly drunk at Katsu Yeah, they're sort of to blame for this thing because you know I was one of those people who didn't pay attention at all.

358
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,817
Rym: I didn't pay attention who made anything.

359
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:02,186
Rym: and then Daryl Surratt comes up to me and he's got.

360
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:03,390
Rym: he puts a recorder in my face.

361
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:04,769
Rym: He's like, can you name?

362
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,480
Rym: Anyone who directs anime?

363
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:18,100
Rym: I think other than Miyazaki and I was like, uh Ikuhara Tezuka that That's all I would have been able to say back then.

364
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,633
Scott: is those and I might have been able to say oh gee I don't think I had.

365
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,360
Scott: I didn't even know Satoshi khan at that point.

366
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:24,907
Rym: Yeah, but now we've met him.

367
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:25,429
Rym: I've touched him.

368
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,854
Rym: Yeah, I was.

369
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:29,182
Rym: that was it was a good experience touching Satoshi khan.

370
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,667
Rym: I hope to do it again someday.

371
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:31,610
Scott: was he smooth?

372
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,710
Rym: He was so smooth and deadly.

373
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:52,904
Rym: And the other panel where anime you should see yeah, which is sort of this generic kind of black panel of hey The thing is Scott, you know in the internal GeekNights Scott is pissy and down on pretty much every panel we ever do.

374
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:54,330
Scott: Why what are you talking about?

375
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,806
Rym: He always complains that we shouldn't do that panel and we shouldn't do that panel more than once.

376
00:20:57,826 --> 00:20:58,489
Rym: that panels lame.

377
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,318
Scott: We're talking about the point all.

378
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:06,390
Scott: the only thing I was a about is you know enemy you should see is an okay panel.

379
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,040
Rym: It's an incredibly important panel.

380
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,120
Rym: the

381
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:20,201
Scott: principle behind it is sort of generic and I was also kind of a because You the wanted us to do the gecky a panel again at the New York anime festival Even though he already did the gecky a panel at the New York anime festival,

382
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:22,290
Rym: even though we're running it basically completely differently.

383
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,515
Scott: It's not completely different.

384
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:23,857
Rym: Also.

385
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:26,730
Scott: Yes, it's mostly it's it's only a little bit differently.

386
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,990
Scott: Anyway, the point is is that It's not every pan.

387
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:37,750
Scott: All the other panels are awesome and anime you should see is still an okay panel because we're awesome and we can make any panel.

388
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:38,232
Scott: Awesome.

389
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:39,898
Rym: I just don't get like panels like that.

390
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,625
Rym: What why is generic a bad thing?

391
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:44,176
Scott: I didn't say it was a bad thing I just said it was generic.

392
00:21:44,457 --> 00:21:48,653
Rym: and a and a it's not at all It is.

393
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:52,950
Rym: how is it a to talk to people speak any medium any genre of thing?

394
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,730
Rym: Like are into board gaming and you just take give a talk where all right all you nubs you're new into this.

395
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:01,626
Rym: Here's all the like the important games that no one will ever tell you about it.

396
00:22:01,646 --> 00:22:02,510
Rym: You won't find out about it.

397
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,044
Scott: So I guess it's just not a very glamorous panel to be running.

398
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:07,610
Rym: Oh, so glamour is what you're after.

399
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:08,614
Scott: Yeah, perhaps.

400
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:11,064
Rym: besides I point out that majesty.

401
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:18,748
Rym: perhaps also if you're going for glamour Those are actually the panels that get the most traction are like the game shows and the generically titled panel.

402
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:19,530
Scott: Those are glamorous.

403
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:23,050
Rym: The game shows how are they more glamorous than this in terms?

404
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,490
Rym: I mean the crowds the same get a gigantic yelling crowd special guests making the game show glamorous.

405
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,316
Rym: Yeah, getting like Peter Fernandez.

406
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:33,310
Scott: Yes, if they had a special guest that enemy you should see instant majesty.

407
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:39,698
Scott: All right, two weeks after Otakon so Otakon Then the weekend after that.

425
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,650
Scott: I've never been farther west then, you know, no by Michigan.

426
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:49,030
Rym: Yeah, but we're actually doing an event at the penny arcade Expo called beyond dungeons and dragons.

427
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:56,207
Scott: We're gonna be talking all about You know all the indie RPGs and the RPGs that are not like D&D and other D&D like our.

428
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:56,347
Scott: and

429
00:23:56,388 --> 00:24:11,667
Rym: I'm gonna say one thing Now this if this sounds cool to you because I think this sounds really cool but we're going to begin like the kind of the brief bit that we're gonna introduce this panel with is and I title it affectionately a Brief history of Dungeons & Dragons as told through its character sheet.

430
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:16,160

00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:26,082
Rym: that little presentation Yep, that little five-minute bit.

434
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:27,210
Scott: That's a good way to start it off.

435
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:35,499
Scott: But basically that the thesis of this panel is you guys out there, you know, you might like comic books But you know this indie comic books that are way cool, right?

436
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,584

455
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:45,464
Rym: Yeah, so if you want to see us go to one of those events and you will be practically guaranteed to meet us We're we're incredibly hard to miss at a convention.

456
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:53,670
Scott: There are some other events We may or may not attend and we are may or may not run an event of a small event of some kind.

457
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:54,912
Scott: It's in the works.

458
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,495
Scott: But for now, that's it.

459
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:57,116
Scott: That's all I got.

460
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,830
Rym: Well, that was kind of random.

461
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,727
Rym: I guess we'll just do some things in the day and then get on with it.

462
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:09,006
Scott: Yeah Get on with it.

463
00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:12,558
Scott: So, uh, it's all this.

464
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:17,844
Rym: then this is this is one of my reserve things of the day But it's something I've known about forever.

465
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:18,750
Rym: I always saw links to it.

466
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:25,107
Rym: I never really went to and I finally went there the other day and I ended up wasting about two hours on this site.

467
00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:36,150
Rym: It's Passive-aggressive and the idea is you know, sometimes someone's so passive-aggressive that they won't Do something about something like I don't know your roommate eats all your food.

468
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:38,879
Rym: You don't say hey roommate get the fuck out.

469
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:39,823
Rym: or hey roommate.

470
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:41,890
Rym: Stop eating my fucking Cheerios you ass.

471
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:50,348
Rym: Instead you write a little note saying please stop eating my stuff and you stick it where you know They'll see it, you know avoiding confrontation that sort of thing.

472
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:53,910
Rym: Nothing is funnier to me than reading those sorts of notes.

473
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:02,640
Rym: this website is a place where if you see a note like that take a picture of it and put it online for Everyone to enjoy most of those bright fake though.

474
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,550
Rym: No, actually a lot of them are very clearly not fake.

475
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,373
Scott: How could you tell?

476
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:13,097
Rym: because I've the kinds of notes that are on this site are the notes that I've seen Many many a time in the real world.

477
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:13,720
Scott: Alrighty.

478
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,482
Scott: What can I give you?

479
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:15,446
Scott: some example notes?

480
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:16,610
Rym: I don't have any up here.

481
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,030
Rym: What do you offer me an example note?

482
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,750
Rym: A lot of them are notes that like a company you'll put up like someone stole someone's lunch.

483
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:25,506
Rym: So someone writes a note like to the person stealing the lunches.

484
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:26,210
Rym: blah blah blah.

485
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:29,019
Scott: Okay, I see you're talking about yeah, okay.

486
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:31,789
Rym: I could see that or a lot of times a lot most of it.

487
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:38,630
Rym: It's like half People in businesses writing notes because they're afraid of confronting other people at their business.

488
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:43,150
Rym: Yeah, the other half is college kids who just never learned how to confront people.

489
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:53,010
Rym: Yeah, and then I guess the other 1% you know rounding that's not accounted for are the ultra hilarious Just like crazy ones that have all these follow-ups.

490
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:54,939
Scott: I mean there have to be fake ones on there.

491
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,290
Rym: right people do a good job of verifying them.

492
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:02,550
Rym: It looks like because a lot of times they'll be follow-up threads and people will like here's what happened the next day.

493
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:03,766
Rym: Here's the response.

494
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:04,030
Rym: note.

495
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,949
Scott: Just be really good at telling a story.

496
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:09,563
Rym: Okay, it fine.

497
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:10,450
Rym: Maybe one's fake.

498
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,647
Scott: Great, maybe one Is fake.

499
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:17,214
Rym: Seriously go read this side.

500
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:18,941
Rym: I get the impression that these are almost all.

501
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:22,419
Rym: I would guess that 90% of these are legitimate rather Legitimate or not.

502
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:25,745
Scott: they're fun, but at the point I'm trying to get at is whether they're fake or not.

503
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:27,553
Scott: if they're funny What what does it matter?

504
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:29,681
Rym: case in point the classic?

505
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,310
Scott: Hey crackhead hey crack, and that's great.

506
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,550
Scott: And was that was the thing of the day was doesn't early thing?

507
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:36,870
Rym: I'm sure that was the thing of the day.

508
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:40,673
Scott: I don't know if I use this as a thing of day or not and if it's a repeat I don't give a shit.

509
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:44,185
Scott: This is you've probably seen this if you're on the Internet's at all.

510
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:45,649
Scott: It's basically office war.

511
00:28:45,710 --> 00:29:05,490
Scott: now when it comes to things like water balloons or nerf or you know other sorts of non-lethal toy weaponry Everyone from when they're a child to even when you're growing up a little bit you imagine having really elaborate Well adjudicated battles with these things.

512
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,674
Scott: You know I mean like when your kids you always have a water balloon fight But you never have like a real.

513
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:20,061
Scott: you always really want to have like a serious water balloon fight with like shit tons of water balloons and like you have like Bandoliers of water balloons and the whole thing going on.

514
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:25,601
Scott: you actually want people to say you know like have some sort of Rules of winning and losing and there's some appeal to that.

515
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:30,748
Scott: I don't understand what it is, but it's it's a desire I know I've had and I know a lot of other people have also had.

516
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:32,857
Scott: so Vision a vision.

517
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:40,970
Rym: I have a vision of everyone in the front row crew Agreeing to an arsenal all buying a standard loadout of nerf equipment and then going nuts.

518
00:29:41,452 --> 00:29:50,467
Scott: I think tribes do is much better idea, but anyway, you know what we have a better pulling off the former Perhaps I say perhaps a lot today.

519
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,699
Scott: so nerf You know that nerf for a while right?

520
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,164
Scott: I don't know if everyone was.

521
00:29:57,205 --> 00:30:01,310
Scott: I'm sure everyone listening knows about nerf But nerf basically makes foam toys

522
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:03,621
Rym: I don't think you need to explain most

523
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:13,335
Scott: of that and they're famous for their foam Weapons in addition to their foam footballs mostly the foam weapons and for many years their foam weapons have been Sort of subpar.

524
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:21,843
Scott: because if you know over protection of kids and all that sort of bullshit You know the nerf weapons you could buy in the store were not what they were when we were kids.

525
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:25,969
Scott: the selection is decreased the power And accuracy is decreased.

526
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:29,660
Scott: The quality of the weapons overall is decreasing me.

527
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,347
Scott: there's no nerf bow and arrow anymore.

528
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:32,130
Scott: what happened to it?

529
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,290
Scott: You know, meanwhile the original nerf bow and arrow kicked ass like one of the best toys ever made.

530
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:40,524
Rym: I remember they were so hard to get that over Christmas.

531
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:41,930
Rym: My brother got one.

532
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,922
Scott: It's like nerf bow and arrow is like on the Super Soaker level of toy, but I didn't.

533
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:50,795
Rym: I got a knockoff Robin Hood bow and arrow Useless.

534
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,610
Rym: my parents knew it's just what are they gonna do that?

535
00:30:52,911 --> 00:31:01,589
Rym: One of the kids was gonna be disappointed just by don't buy anything and then wait And deny us a nerf bow and arrow.

536
00:31:02,474 --> 00:31:03,901
Scott: Well, no is you buy give one.

537
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,590
Scott: you say I'll get another one as soon as I can.

538
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,169
Rym: Yes, and you know long it took for those to be back in stock.

539
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,368
Scott: That's you know, that's what it takes.

540
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:16,570
Scott: Anyway, so nerf, I guess they're attempting to make a comeback which is fine by me.

541
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:21,490
Scott: And what they've done is they've done something that's actually pretty extraordinary.

542
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:34,742
Scott: Number one someone in nerf must realize what makes nerf awesome because They they realize that people want to have these organized, you know People have this fantasy of organized serious total all-out nerf war.

543
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:44,693
Scott: they realize this fantasy exists and they made a video That sort of works towards fulfilling that fantasy or stoking the fires of that fantasy To.

544
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:51,730
Scott: they have re-upped their equipment it seems because in this video There are many many awesome nerf things.

545
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:59,230
Scott: For example, the nerf sniper rifle something which used to be only made in the homebrew arena is now an official product.

546
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:05,450
Scott: They've got the nerf like electronic minigun with the chain of suction cup arrow.

547
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,377
Rym: I had the old hand crank minigun.

548
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:12,710
Rym: It was the last nerf item I ever got and while it was awesome the Belt feed was prone to jam.

549
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:18,548
Scott: This is basically like a Maxim machine gun of nerf right and when they pull the thing out, it's like oh man.

550
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:29,424
Rym: and I remember that my the biggest fantasy I had early on as a kid was when I started getting all these nerf guns was I wanted a pistol that I cocked and then fired instead of a kind of bow action.

551
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:31,270
Rym: and they made that back in the day.

552
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:32,815
Scott: Yeah, almost right away.

553
00:32:32,855 --> 00:32:37,612
Scott: Well, we I had the ones that hold three arrows and you wouldn't conk and fire You.

554
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:39,241
Scott: just you know, it's sort of like those.

555
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:40,890
Rym: watch out those little black arrow.

556
00:32:40,935 --> 00:32:43,559
Scott: Yeah you know the water guns that work by suction like that.

557
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:46,914
Scott: you'd sort of fill them up and then you pull the two ends close to Each other.

558
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,126
Scott: that's like a shotgun.

559
00:32:48,187 --> 00:32:49,654
Scott: almost That's how this worked.

560
00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:49,714
Scott: is?

561
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:57,264
Scott: you would pull the front of the gun forward and then pull it back and it would just your own The force of your arm would push the air to shoot the air.

562
00:32:57,304 --> 00:32:57,706
Rym: I had that.

563
00:32:57,746 --> 00:32:58,570
Rym: it was my sidearm.

564
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,039
Rym: What I also did was I learned is those little black arrows.

565
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,990
Rym: if you threw them like a knife they flew perfectly.

566
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:07,208
Scott: They're really the most aerodynamic arrows, I love those arrows.

567
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:11,460
Scott: anyway You know They've also got like velcro things going on and the whole bit now.

568
00:33:11,882 --> 00:33:19,669
Scott: the other thing to nerf has managed to do here with this Video is not only advertise their products stoke the fires of you know, a fantasy that many people have etc.

569
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:27,523
Scott: This is perhaps the first example I've seen of someone Intentionally attempting to make a you know viral video.

570
00:33:27,543 --> 00:33:39,007
Scott: That's also an obvious advertisement Because I mean it has to be an advertisement because they're unreleased nerf equipment's in here and the video production quality is very very high and the quantity of equipment could not be had.

571
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:44,879
Scott: and let's nerve for provided it Is that they actually made a good thing.

572
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,730
Scott: it's like this is a good video and they made it on purpose.

573
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:48,916
Rym: Yep, it's any time.

574
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:51,510
Rym: when have you seen there's one other time in my life?

575
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,941
Rym: It was also recently when we were at James and Lisa's wedding.

576
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:57,330
Rym: There was also Stanley Cup playoff action.

577
00:33:58,111 --> 00:34:09,150
Rym: So, you know, we're of course we're watching hockey in the hotel room instead of hanging out because that's what you do Actually, we had a bunch of everyone came to our hotel room We all hung out and then the hotel guy was like you can't all sleep in this room.

578
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,179
Rym: They were like, we're not gonna go away.

579
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:11,944
Scott: I was watching hockey.

580
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:12,748
Rym: your hotel sucks.

581
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:14,356
Scott: He sure did.

582
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:16,107
Scott: We should have stayed at the motel.

583
00:34:16,127 --> 00:34:16,530
Scott: Whatever right?

584
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,552
Rym: I sure did.

585
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:21,446
Rym: All right, and this ad came on and this it's one of the.

586
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:22,710
Rym: this ad was so funny.

587
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:24,315
Scott: I was a good ad I was.

588
00:34:24,577 --> 00:34:29,500
Rym: not only did I watch it and like it and seek it out on the internet to watch Again, but I find it.

589
00:34:29,782 --> 00:34:30,244
Rym: I found it.

590
00:34:30,264 --> 00:34:31,190
Rym: I don't know if it's still on YouTube.

591
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:41,370
Rym: I'll find it again and post a link but it's basically this guy and It's like in the maternity ward and there's all the babies behind the glass and all the parents are there and you know the nursery.

592
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,092
Scott: Yeah Yeah everyone's looking.

593
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:47,889
Rym: and then suddenly he starts banging on the glass and screaming and yelling and just.

594
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:51,498
Rym: And then he starts pointing at all the other babies.

595
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,945
Rym: he's like you suck you suck you suck.

596
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:57,490
Rym: best baby ever right there best Baby ever you suck you suck.

597
00:34:57,731 --> 00:35:10,476
Scott: It was such hockey right there banging on the glass Pointed at everyone in the other team saying you suck you suck you suck as baby and then pointed at the guy in your team And saying oh, yeah, awesome It's funny out.

598
00:35:10,537 --> 00:35:18,650
Rym: sports commercials in general seem to do this like sports commercials Understand the fans of their respective sports better than almost any other advertising I ever see.

599
00:35:18,871 --> 00:35:29,770
Scott: Yep, and this is a this is this nerf Viral intentional commercial meme thing actually works and really understands the feeling that us kind of people have for nerve.

600
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:36,967
Rym: so Scott tomorrow What are you gonna be doing in the morning waking up too goddamn early?

601
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,374
Rym: Yeah Why is that?

602
00:35:38,796 --> 00:35:43,172
Scott: because I get one of the stupid iPhones if I don't get one tomorrow And

603
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:53,585
Rym: we need one for our company because we got to test it because pretty much we all want to switch to it And we got to make sure we can do all of all the same things we do with our blackberries with the iPhone the exchange integration and all that.

604
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:58,230
Rym: so We had to draw lots to see who's gonna stand in line and get an iPhone tomorrow.

605
00:35:58,611 --> 00:36:08,227
Scott: I mean if that's what you want to test you could have just gotten a first-generation iPhone and upgraded the Software on it, and you'd be the same exact thing.

606
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:14,270
Rym: yeah Basically because they announced all the exchange stuff after the first one came out and we want the newest one anyway.

607
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:17,990
Scott: So I mean of course you want the newest one, but yeah, you know to test exchange.

608
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,539
Rym: There were a few ways around this however.

609
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,900
Scott: This is the most fun way yes, so anyway I'm gonna go wait in line.

610
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,675
Scott: now the question is which line Do I waited?

611
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:30,786
Rym: I would go to an AT&T store because there are AT&T stores.

612
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:31,790
Scott: there are Apple stores.

613
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,140
Scott: There's multiple of each in Manhattan.

614
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,218
Scott: does even AT&T stores up here in Beacon area Store in Danbury, Connecticut?

615
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:41,840
Scott: I could go to.

616
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,025
Rym: it's obvious if I were you.

617
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:53,189
Rym: what I would have done is long ago taking the day off work and just camped out the Apple the AT&T store up near here because Far fewer people are gonna try to camp that thing out.

618
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:56,319
Scott: Ah, but the steeply supply will also be lower.

619
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:03,910
Scott: for example if I go to the Apple store in the city sure I might wait Two hours, but they probably have a few thousand iPhones in there.

620
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,558
Scott: So yeah, I'm gonna get Scott the Apple store.

621
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:10,048
Rym: How many people do you think are already lined up probably right now?

622
00:37:10,248 --> 00:37:10,730
Scott: right now?

623
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,577
Scott: I'm it's actually quite surprising.

624
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:21,894
Scott: I just probably less than less than 200 there right now I don't know I. I went to an AT&T store and asked her place and I said How many iPhones you gonna get?

625
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:25,925
Scott: and of course they said we don't know okay, then I said one no no.

626
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:32,710
Scott: then I said um Last time when the first iPhone came out how many people were there in line outside?

627
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:37,770
Scott: And she said oh about 250, and I said how many of those people got iPhones?

628
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,600
Scott: And she said all of them.

629
00:37:40,063 --> 00:37:46,130
Scott: so that makes me go Aha, ha ha you see you just have to learn to ask the tricky questions.

630
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,125
Scott: This is why I have a tiny bit of journalism skills.

631
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:49,950
Scott: course not much.

632
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:56,563
Rym: We felt a tiny bit when we were trying to get Sensitive information out of the people for that World of Warcraft miniatures game.

633
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,550
Rym: We were like so how's the game work?

634
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,098
Rym: We can't talk about gameplay so suppose.

635
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:14,190
Scott: I'm playing can't talk about game, but I think they were just much Better at not answering questions, so they actually use judgment whereas this person Just only you know didn't answer the one question.

636
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,260
Scott: They weren't allowed to answer and answered every other question.

637
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:17,708
Rym: also probably didn't care.

638
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,856
Scott: also Did still knowing people.

639
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:21,059
Rym: most people actually don't.

640
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,290
Rym: most people probably don't even realize they can go to an AT&T store.

641
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:29,190
Scott: The other thing is that at the AT&T store the people there were actually friendly and knowledgeable.

642
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:29,592
Scott: It was.

643
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:32,810
Rym: it was quite unlike the Apple store where they beat you as you walk in.

644
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:39,255
Scott: No, but I'm saying it's like I'm compared to say what you would expect from an average wireless You know store.

645
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:39,999
Rym: can you say this?

646
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:42,110
Scott: I went to the wireless companies is evil and stupid.

647
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,738
Rym: I went to the Verizon store.

648
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:47,814
Scott: the other I mean like remember how it was in the Sprint store for you Don't?

649
00:38:47,854 --> 00:38:50,529
Rym: I could do a whole Monday on Sprint right and so.

650
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:56,694
Scott: So because I'm gonna be waiting in this line tomorrow possibly with my boss also Cuz his trio.

651
00:38:56,735 --> 00:39:08,564
Scott: he went swimming with his trio by accident, so now he's thinking about iPhones even though He always complained that didn't have a real keyboard, but once a long time ago He's asking me like text messaging when I get in line.

652
00:39:08,624 --> 00:39:14,370
Rym: when I was very drunk I ended up showering with my phone in my pocket, but it didn't hurt it right anyway.

653
00:39:16,532 --> 00:39:19,288
Scott: So yeah because of this waiting in line that's gonna happen.

654
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:20,996
Scott: tomorrow We'll talk about the iPhone itself.

655
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:24,670
Scott: you know two Mondays from now when actually I've had a lot of time with it and such.

656
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:28,683
Scott: But I figured we could do it Thursday on waiting in line.

657
00:39:28,763 --> 00:39:33,220
Scott: cuz we've waited in on quite a many line We have the biggest thing you have to know.

658
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:38,460
Rym: we've learned this lesson very very powerfully But we had a chance to meet someone very eminent one.

659
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:46,490
Scott: see I think actually in the episode where we talked about this We discussed waiting in line Which is why I feel like we've done a waiting in line episode before.

660
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:55,484
Scott: But if we haven't done a waiting in line episode if we have done a waiting in line episode before oh well Sorry, but we I gotta wake up early.

661
00:39:55,786 --> 00:39:58,590
Rym: We've decided Oh, let's camp out And then this will be awesome.

662
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,537
Rym: And then we kind of both bailed because neither one of us Really wanted to camp out.

663
00:40:02,577 --> 00:40:05,894
Rym: and why don't we just wait till morning and we'll take an early ish Training.

664
00:40:06,256 --> 00:40:08,068
Rym: don't have to take the first train in.

665
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:13,967
Rym: yeah I realize we'll get in the way of this awesome thing and we ended up totally failing as a result.

666
00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:16,537
Scott: the thing is we were Pretty close to succeeding.

667
00:40:16,577 --> 00:40:18,865
Rym: there was yes, but we didn't want it enough.

668
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,010
Scott: No we didn't want it.

669
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,470
Scott: And that's really when you're waiting in line.

670
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:27,163
Scott: There's a decision-making process that happens and you have to weigh three things right.

671
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,310
Scott: how badly do you want?

672
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:29,470
Scott: well?

673
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,930
Scott: What are you gonna get for waiting in line right?

674
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:36,569
Scott: How badly do you want that thing that you're waiting in line for?

675
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:42,169
Scott: Right and then how long do you have to wait in line to get what you want?

676
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:47,196
Scott: Because you know some lines you just wait in them And you're eventually gonna get what you want.

677
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:54,002
Scott: like say if you go to cedar point if you wait in a line to ride a Rollercoaster oh no no no you're going to ride it.

678
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:55,970
Rym: Oh, that's not always true.

679
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,095
Rym: Yeah, at all didn't?

680
00:40:57,115 --> 00:40:59,103
Scott: they close the park, and then they cut off the line.

681
00:40:59,465 --> 00:41:06,884
Rym: now because you see Oftentimes a particular ride for various reasons some routes are more prone to this than others will break down.

682
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:08,628
Rym: ah and what happens?

683
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:08,989
Rym: is this?

684
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:10,575
Rym: Incredible calculus.

685
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:23,390
Rym: where I'm in line and I see that the line is not moved in a while And I look up and I see some people Abandoning the line as root word spreads that the rides down and people are trying to guess when it is why when you're in a?

686
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,729
Scott: Long line for a ride you spread a rumor that the ride is broken down when it has not here.

687
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:29,298
Rym: see There's the reason that doesn't work.

688
00:41:29,338 --> 00:41:31,490
Rym: is that canny people who go to amusement parks?

689
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:39,841
Rym: You don't pay attention to a rumor that comes from the back of the line And no one in the front of the line has any incentive.

690
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,589
Scott: that's true granted.

691
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:47,127
Rym: ah The real trick is just to cut Because I'll admit this I'm just horrible.

692
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:53,227
Rym: But the majority of people are too passive too passive to actually do anything about it.

693
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:56,057
Scott: if you cut in front of them Yeah, well here's the thing about cutting.

694
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,324
Scott: It's like you know you cut in front of.

695
00:41:58,364 --> 00:41:59,990
Scott: let's say you cut in front of an asshole.

696
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:04,468
Scott: Right he'll be all like gravel gravel gravel gravel, so you say all right man.

697
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,596
Scott: Just chill Then you just cut.

698
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:09,070
Scott: you know a little bit in front of that.

699
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,004
Scott: You're not cutting directly in front of the asshole somehow.

700
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:13,815
Scott: He has no problem with it He can't you know?

701
00:42:13,855 --> 00:42:17,756
Scott: even though the effect on him is the same He's still one spot further back in line.

702
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:18,980
Rym: see the thing is secret.

703
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,789
Rym: point actually did something really good when whenever you if they caught Someone cutting in line they did have people who were semi undercover watching for it.

704
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:29,270
Rym: They literally dragged you out of the park with no refund immediately.

705
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:30,434
Scott: Yeah, that's a game.

706
00:42:30,454 --> 00:42:33,184
Rym: I I watch it happen a lot of course.

707
00:42:33,244 --> 00:42:34,328
Rym: I also cut in line, but I was.

708
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:34,529
Rym: well.

709
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,074
Scott: Here's the thing right all right.

710
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:37,198
Scott: well cutting in line.

711
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:44,485
Scott: obviously you want to try to pull off cutting in line if you can But you don't want to cut in line to the point where you have to suffer the consequences.

712
00:42:44,546 --> 00:42:47,650
Rym: That's Are we gonna explain how to cut in line?

713
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,273
Rym: It's a very specific process.

714
00:42:49,293 --> 00:42:55,030
Scott: I will tell you the best line cutter in the entire universe is my grandmother.

715
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,658
Rym: ah See she has an advantage being old.

716
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:58,060
Rym: well.

717
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,210
Scott: No no no even when she was not old she would write.

718
00:43:00,473 --> 00:43:02,150
Scott: So we're in law she demonstrate.

719
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:13,689
Scott: I know she's used this skill many times in movie theaters and other places, but it was only demonstrated to me and only one Currents that I can actually remember even though I have stories of other times when I wasn't there.

720
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:18,330
Scott: We were at I believe Madame Tussauds wax museum in New York City.

721
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:22,853
Scott: This is like many years ago perhaps even a decade ago I don't know.

722
00:43:22,874 --> 00:43:28,831
Scott: um and as a line and my grandma we weren't in the line right, but the line is sort of going down the Street.

723
00:43:29,613 --> 00:43:36,899
Scott: we just sort of standing on the sidewalk and my grandma just strikes up a conversation with this complete stranger in line And I like I don't.

724
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:44,118
Scott: yeah at that time in my life I was not the type to converse with a stranger, but my grandma has no problem Just talking to anybody.

725
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:46,490
Rym: that is in fact the best way to cut it alive.

726
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:56,138
Scott: She just starts talking to the stranger and walking with them and talking and walking to talk and look that we're inside And we didn't have to wait in the line, and I'm like alrighty.

727
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:05,450
Rym: The way I often did it was partly because One of the pastimes in my high school was to skip school and go to cedar point whenever it was warm out.

728
00:44:05,932 --> 00:44:14,609
Rym: So a lot of times I'd end up at cedar point like I just kind of cut out of high school and drive down to Cedar point and there'd be a lot of people from my high school there independently of me.

729
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,970
Rym: So this one time the Millennium Force the new when it was the tallest roller coaster in the world they built it.

730
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,355
Rym: It's like this epic thing and I'd been.

731
00:44:22,937 --> 00:44:28,181
Rym: I've been looking forward to this since they announced like Intamin was like rollercoasters and all this business.

732
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:33,955
Rym: so we show up and We get into the park like a little bit late And there's a huge line.

733
00:44:33,975 --> 00:44:38,630
Rym: huge line not even in the turnstiles yet because the rides don't start right away when the park opens.

734
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:45,030
Rym: So people are lined up, and I see that in the very front of this line is my good friend Adam.

735
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:51,790
Rym: Yeah So uh we I walked by and I've got a huge group of people with me because we all cut class at the same day.

736
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,298
Rym: Kind of random wasn't senior skip day.

737
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,270
Rym: It was just we just all skipped.

738
00:44:56,078 --> 00:45:03,510
Rym: So we're all walking in this big group And if I had tried to just do it by myself because other people were so pumped about it We totally would have gotten busted.

739
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:24,027
Rym: but this giant group with me in it kind of stops next to the line and we all talk and then the line starts walking in and You saw this moment of decision and like three or four smart people including me in this mob that was standing next to the line Took quick action and slipped in in the chaos and everyone else kind of stood there going.

740
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:24,930
Rym: hey, what's going on?

741
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:26,475
Rym: Hey, where'd you guys go?

742
00:45:26,495 --> 00:45:27,740
Rym: But then it was too late.

743
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,064
Scott: Yeah, that's how's done.

744
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:30,670
Scott: so the thing here right?

745
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,289
Scott: We've discussed how to cut in a line.

746
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:37,930
Scott: How do you what do you do when people are cutting in front of you because you say get the fuck out of line?

747
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:43,270
Scott: Yep, and if you see people cutting way ahead of you you say hey, hey, hey, are you get the hell out?

748
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,394
Rym: You cut exactly like that.

749
00:45:44,435 --> 00:45:45,600
Rym: That's how you have to go.

750
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:45,841
Rym: Hey.

751
00:45:45,941 --> 00:45:46,122
Rym: Hey.

752
00:45:46,262 --> 00:45:46,463
Rym: Hey.

753
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:50,202
Rym: Yep, at least in New York There might be a different way of doing if you West.

754
00:45:50,483 --> 00:45:50,705
Scott: you know.

755
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:51,650
Scott: if you do so.

756
00:45:52,232 --> 00:45:54,240
Scott: We've said people are very not.

757
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,725
Scott: most people don't want to have.

758
00:45:55,745 --> 00:45:56,990
Scott: you know a confrontation, right?

759
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,750
Scott: So if you you know cut in line, they won't confront you about it.

760
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:09,989
Scott: But at the same time if you confront someone who is trying to cut who is non-confrontational They would rather give up on their cut then confront you.

761
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:17,710
Rym: Also, you can usually call down the threat of something because there's always the external force like in the Nintendo store line.

762
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,790
Rym: If you raised a ruckus about someone cutting Nintendo would have come out and dragged him away.

763
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:26,563
Scott: It really what it really comes down to is how well the line is enforced.

764
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:31,249
Scott: a very poorly enforced line is pretty much bad news.

765
00:46:32,196 --> 00:46:35,578
Scott: that's really what it is a Poorly enforced line.

766
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:44,710
Scott: a line without you know management Is very is pro cutter and a line with lots of management is pro anti cutter.

767
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:54,717
Scott: So if you know a line is gonna have guards or you know official people making sure that everything is legit Then you don't you want to get there early.

768
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:01,986
Scott: if you know a line is gonna be just sort of willy-nilly then Don't worry about when you get there cuz you just cut.

769
00:47:02,801 --> 00:47:03,028
Rym: Yep.

770
00:47:03,471 --> 00:47:14,070
Rym: Now bonus points if you cut in line and then within a short span of time Prevent someone else from cutting in line by raising a ruckus and no one confronts you about the hypocrisy.

771
00:47:14,471 --> 00:47:16,577
Scott: That is a classy move.

772
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:18,162
Rym: That is a goal in life.

773
00:47:18,483 --> 00:47:20,569
Scott: That is that is something you should definitely do.

774
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:24,370
Rym: Uh, of course, one of my favorite things to do in line is to bother other people.

775
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,070
Scott: Well, that's another thing about lines.

776
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:27,452
Scott: It's not.

777
00:47:27,532 --> 00:47:27,633
Scott: it's.

778
00:47:27,753 --> 00:47:31,290
Scott: the line is not just about achieving what you are there for.

779
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:38,310
Rym: For a lot of people it even though that is the number one thing for a lot of people it is and that's the problem A lot of people if you have to wait in a line somewhere.

780
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,940
Rym: I mean this could be applied generally to any time you're forced to wait for something.

781
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:48,190
Rym: but lines in particular a lot of people one Don't bring any means of entertaining themselves.

782
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,981
Scott: It's definitely something you got to do and thus did.

783
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:57,278
Rym: all the time spent in the line is wasted Yep and to a lot of people Will only see the prize at the end.

784
00:47:57,298 --> 00:48:00,530
Rym: the goal of I'm going to get a thing and this line is my means to it.

785
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:08,479
Rym: But especially with geeky stuff like iPhones or like the Nintendo Store thing or an anime con The line is a self-selected people.

786
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,469
Rym: stop a self-selected set of people.

787
00:48:11,952 --> 00:48:14,344
Scott: Yes, you can form you have similar interests.

788
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,510
Scott: Yeah, you have a line.

789
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:20,250
Scott: There's almost as line culture this line community that builds and then is dispersed.

790
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,790
Scott: It's like a temporary family and it's it's really something special.

791
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:33,310
Scott: And if you're not gonna take any part in that really of no place waiting in line At least not for a long amount of time, of course watch out because it's very tricky.

792
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:34,819
Rym: So, I mean we were in the line of the Nintendo.

793
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:36,650
Scott: it really depends in who you're in line.

794
00:48:37,192 --> 00:48:40,064
Rym: It was pretty much us and the area we like.

795
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:46,840
Rym: there were other cool people our age but all the people in line right near us were Punk kids and they were.

796
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,189
Rym: they were like punk kids that were barely sentience.

797
00:48:49,591 --> 00:48:53,807
Rym: Yep, and the conversations that we had with these kids were not shall we say and lightning.

798
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:59,130
Rym: now And I remember we tried to play advance wars with them and that just did not happen.

799
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:05,170
Scott: No, I didn't and there were some cool people near us, but they were mostly quiet and their DS's ran out of batteries.

800
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:08,813
Rym: Yeah, the one guy who was like, oh man, I love advance wars I'm undefeated.

801
00:49:08,874 --> 00:49:12,650
Rym: my group of friends and we were about to play in his battery died immediately.

802
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,534
Scott: Huge taboo.

803
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:18,010
Scott: having any of your devices run out of battery power in a line.

804
00:49:18,171 --> 00:49:23,761
Rym: I'll give you the hint if your laptops about to run out of battery Don't be like I shit my battery or don't let it just run out.

805
00:49:24,143 --> 00:49:26,050
Rym: just be like I'm done with his laptop.

806
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:29,370
Rym: I'm gonna relax and kind of shut it down gracefully like nothing's wrong.

807
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:34,070
Scott: Yes, you don't want to let anyone know your batteries ran out because that is taboo.

808
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,579
Scott: That's like like one of the worst things you could do.

809
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,469
Scott: I guess other than stabbing I guess that was awesome.

810
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:47,110
Rym: Of course there's also the danger of it's like anime cons has happened to us where you're in line and The person in front of you may be cool.

811
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:56,579
Rym: You're trying to talk to them But the person in line behind you is one of those people one of those fanboys keeps bothering you and isn't I like Naruto?

812
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:57,729
Rym: do you like Naruto?

813
00:50:00,035 --> 00:50:01,268
Rym: Was talking about the Naruto?

814
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:12,009
Scott: If you encounter those kinds of fanboys out and about it's easy to just run away from them or say see ya What's your I am in order something in order to avoid them?

815
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:18,087
Scott: You would have to like lose your spot in line or find some way to kick them out of line Which good luck with that?

816
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:28,743
Scott: So it really puts you in a predicament and when you get in a line, you really have to decide, you know do you stand there and wait for there to be cool people and then you get in line?

817
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:34,219
Scott: that way your line community is gonna be good or Do you just you know is it?

818
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,070
Scott: you can't wait for the line to get any longer?

819
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,249
Scott: You need to get in now or else you're gonna miss out on whatever it is.

820
00:50:39,672 --> 00:50:41,850
Rym: There's also the issue of do you engage or not?

821
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:52,910
Rym: because if you're in line people will generally leave you alone unless you engage or put yourself in a Kind of body language position where people will look at you and think he wants to be engaged.

822
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:57,970
Scott: Yeah, like, you know people by default in a line will just not talk not interact.

823
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:04,029
Scott: But as soon as you know someone, you know, try something, you know, then some interacting might happen.

824
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:09,030
Scott: It's like no one will try to interact starts talking right away like whoa, we're in a line.

825
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,120
Scott: Hey guys, what's going on dadada?

826
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,069
Rym: cuz everyone will start paying attention to you.

827
00:51:13,472 --> 00:51:15,610
Rym: You'll get this little kind of crowd around you.

828
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:23,858
Rym: But at the same time if anyone undesirable joins that crowd there is no Safe socially acceptable way to reject them.

829
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:29,390
Scott: and also, you know, if someone doesn't want to interact They're not going to and no one will try to enter.

830
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:36,439
Scott: No one will force them into interacting, you know, like if you just stand there quietly and just mind your own business No one will bother you in a line.

831
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:37,203
Scott: They'll just ignore you.

832
00:51:37,404 --> 00:51:54,310
Rym: So basically Here's the quickie if someone you don't want to talk to keeps engaging you in a line and you're trying to engage other people Don't you know like be like, oh you suck don't yell at him or anything or don't do anything Active or aggressive because you know what we said, yeah passive-aggressive doesn't really work.

833
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:59,069
Rym: You don't really want to hurt the feelings the person in line behind you because they are only going to bother you.

834
00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:13,190
Scott: the rest Yes, and if you do something to get rid of this annoying person in line, you might succeed but you will also Guaranteed make everyone cool in line near you uncomfortable, which is not good Yeah.

835
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:25,460
Rym: so what you do is if they're talking to you you like face them and listen to what they're saying and then Rotate your body about 15 degrees off-axis from them probably to the right.

836
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:42,788
Rym: like if you're facing them kind of have your body your shoulders being 15 degrees away to the right from facing them and still look at them, but don't make direct eye contact and Limit your responses to answers and kind of acknowledgments, but don't like uh-huh.

837
00:52:42,908 --> 00:52:43,069
Scott: Yeah

838
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:49,608
Rym: Oh But yeah Gage further and that is pretty much

839
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:49,809
Scott: the

840
00:52:50,450 --> 00:53:02,569
Rym: Safest least harmful way to disengage from one of those people and then after you've been doing that for a while as soon as they Engage anyone else for a moment engage the person you wanted to engage and everything will be nice and neat.

841
00:53:02,589 --> 00:53:02,850
Rym: you're done.

842
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:09,543
Scott: Yeah, you can sort of you know when they as you sort of you know Pay less and less attention to them and interact with them less and less.

843
00:53:09,844 --> 00:53:15,727
Scott: they might eventually Lash on to someone else and bother them and then you can interact with someone else.

844
00:53:15,808 --> 00:53:18,721
Rym: if you're evil You can force them off on someone.

845
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:19,948
Scott: Yeah, you can make a split.

846
00:53:20,008 --> 00:53:21,881
Scott: basically It's like you have a group of four people.

847
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:22,989
Scott: one of them is bad.

848
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:28,410
Scott: Well, you foist the bad one off on to say the fourth one and then you keep the second one and you're all good.

849
00:53:28,892 --> 00:53:39,388
Rym: I gotta say though the DS is revolutionized line waiting for nature at least in geeky situations because You're gonna find people to play DS games and there's so many multiplayer DS games.

850
00:53:39,729 --> 00:53:43,710
Scott: Yep The iPhone is also gonna be wicked awesome for the line waiting.

851
00:53:43,811 --> 00:53:44,622
Scott: I can tell already.

852
00:53:44,642 --> 00:53:49,450
Scott: of course It sucks to wait in line for the iPhone which would really helped out while you're in line for itself.

853
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,835
Rym: I just bring your DS.

854
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,570
Scott: I'm bringing the DS laptop, you know, I will go to work right afterwards.

855
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,018
Scott: It's mean the line is right next to my office.

856
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,846
Scott: So, how can I yeah, I gotta I gotta pretty much wait in line Go to work?

857
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:11,323
Rym: Yeah the only reason I'm holding out on the iPhone is because I got to make sure I'm not gonna get it unless I can get My work blackberry and use it as my only like wireless device.

858
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:13,008
Scott: I don't have work blackberry to worry about.

859
00:54:13,048 --> 00:54:13,570
Scott: So here I go.

860
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:16,710
Rym: Yeah, plus I mean I got a curve from work and the curves pretty nice.

861
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:22,085
Scott: Also the App Store which I. well they're good talk about this in a week for Monday Yeah, but anyway, what else about line waiting?

862
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,436
Rym: Can we say well I have a bunch of stories about that time.

863
00:54:24,456 --> 00:54:34,750
Rym: me and a bunch of my friends drove this woman insane in line to Cedar Point Like we made her actually like completely freak out and then they actually escorted her out of the line and it wasn't even intentional.

864
00:54:36,394 --> 00:54:36,937
Rym: We were dying.

865
00:54:36,997 --> 00:54:42,963
Rym: we were being very annoying but It was not like I'm doing this to drive you insane.

866
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:44,690
Rym: I'm just being annoying because I'm bored.

867
00:54:45,232 --> 00:54:47,319
Scott: Well, here here's some general line tips.

868
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:52,520
Scott: All right, if there are multiple lines Right get in the shorter one.

869
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,770
Scott: now that might seem like an obvious thing, right?

870
00:54:55,151 --> 00:54:56,283
Scott: But it usually isn't.

871
00:54:56,343 --> 00:55:03,078
Scott: for example You might go to an amusement park Right, and there is a water slide.

872
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:10,250
Scott: and like there might be a tower and there might be multiple water slides in the tower But one of the water slides is a much shorter line than the others.

873
00:55:10,752 --> 00:55:15,130
Scott: It's probably because that water slide is scarier than the others and people don't want to get on that.

874
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:19,703
Scott: Oh, it's usually because it's weaker not that from my experience the scarier ones off.

875
00:55:19,743 --> 00:55:26,390
Rym: now from my experience the higher up and faster and Crazier was the longer the line was rarely because now is the Six Flags New England is a tower.

876
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:37,350
Scott: There's two blue slides and then one green slide And if you wanted to go on the green slide You basically just walked up right past everyone and said green slide green slide green slide and went down the green slide.

877
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:41,650
Rym: So I think a better set of tips are the how to make the line interesting.

878
00:55:42,494 --> 00:55:45,220
Rym: Those are good too Because the way we drove this woman insane was.

879
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:50,449
Rym: we're in line to see your point and one Get in line with a group of friends and you cannot go wrong.

880
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:52,957
Scott: Oh, yeah You bring your own crew.

881
00:55:53,118 --> 00:56:03,330
Rym: you can't lose because I get when I was a little kid and we get it like I'd be in Family or something for a roller coaster at Cedar Point and the line was always hot and boring and oh my god I just want to ride the ride.

882
00:56:03,772 --> 00:56:07,530
Rym: But once I had a car and I started driving down on my own it was me and all my friends.

883
00:56:08,257 --> 00:56:15,190
Rym: It was like alright The line is not time wasted because the whole time you're in line your whole group of friends is together.

884
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:16,355
Rym: Just hang it out.

885
00:56:16,817 --> 00:56:19,930
Rym: And then suddenly you're hanging out as interrupted by a roller coaster.

886
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:22,418
Rym: Mmm, so there's all.

887
00:56:22,438 --> 00:56:24,410
Scott: well, there's the line for the front of the roller coaster.

888
00:56:24,732 --> 00:56:28,919
Rym: Yes, which is almost always worth it Unless you're a roller coaster freak.

889
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:34,010
Rym: in which case I recommend unless it's a hanging roller coaster You want to sit in the front of the last car?

890
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,261
Rym: That is pretty much the best seat and any non hanging roller coaster.

891
00:56:37,302 --> 00:56:39,650
Scott: Yeah sitting in the back of any car is not so great.

892
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:43,050
Rym: Well, if you like a rough ride the back the back of the car is fine.

893
00:56:43,231 --> 00:56:49,967
Rym: I'm not a fan of the back because the front of the car is kind of Ballasted or balanced by the connection to the car in front of it.

894
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:55,110
Rym: But anyway All we did was I'm standing in line, you know, all these people in high school.

895
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:58,190
Rym: We're in line for this roller coaster and there's the metal turnstiles.

896
00:56:58,971 --> 00:57:05,490
Rym: I just start idly chinking a quarter against it like think think think think think think think think think think think think think think think thing.

897
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:06,153
Rym: And I keep doing it.

898
00:57:06,796 --> 00:57:17,124
Rym: and then one of my friends starts doing it think to think to think to think to think to think to Think to think and then all of us kind of start doing it And then this woman's like could you guys stop that?

899
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:17,890
Rym: that's really annoying.

900
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:23,129
Rym: We're like, all right, and we you know, we kind of stop But then someone further down the line starts doing it.

901
00:57:23,511 --> 00:57:31,981
Rym: Oh, and and then someone else starts doing it and then the whole lines doing it and they won't stop and it just keeps going And keeps going and keeps going.

902
00:57:32,001 --> 00:57:32,929
Scott: Did you start doing it again?

903
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:34,608
Rym: Yeah, of course.

904
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:36,627
Rym: Okay at that point All right.

905
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:39,179
Rym: After we laugh because we realized what we had wrought.

906
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:49,016
Rym: and then this goes on for a good five minutes and then this unrelated woman who's there with her family, it looks like, just starts screaming at everyone to stop it.

907
00:57:49,117 --> 00:57:50,383
Rym: And that just makes it get louder.

908
00:57:50,644 --> 00:57:52,412
Rym: And then it goes crazy and they took her away.

909
00:57:52,432 --> 00:57:53,135
Rym: Oh, yeah.

910
00:57:53,677 --> 00:57:56,306
Rym: I felt bad about it, but I totally.

911
00:57:56,587 --> 00:57:58,172
Rym: we stopped when someone asked us to.

912
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:04,756
Rym: And it's sad, but it's also hilarious that some other guy was like, oh, man, and started doing it right away.

913
00:58:04,897 --> 00:58:06,526
Scott: Well, that's really that's a very.

914
00:58:06,546 --> 00:58:07,912
Scott: it's sort of like doing the wave.

915
00:58:07,972 --> 00:58:12,485
Scott: You know, it's a very basic concept of group psychology.

916
00:58:12,505 --> 00:58:19,632
Scott: is that the more complex thing you want to get a group to do it, the more people you want to do it, the harder it is.

917
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:25,758
Scott: But if you want to get more people to do something, your best bet is to have many people do a simple thing.

918
00:58:25,778 --> 00:58:28,451
Scott: And then it is easier to get a large number of people do it.

919
00:58:28,491 --> 00:58:30,380
Scott: For example, you're at a baseball stadium.

920
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,952
Scott: You want to get everyone to do the wave pretty easy.

921
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:36,444
Scott: You want everyone to chant, you know, let's go team.

922
00:58:36,745 --> 00:58:37,387
Scott: Pretty easy.

923
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:40,240
Rym: You want everyone to see the X, the X, the I see can't go.

924
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,908
Rym: So that's not going to happen.

925
00:58:41,948 --> 00:58:43,094
Scott: That's not going to happen with it.

926
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:47,114
Scott: You know, as the number of people increases, the harder it is to get them to do something complex.

927
00:58:47,134 --> 00:58:52,657
Scott: So if you're looking for, you know, deep, complex conversation, the people next to you are it.

928
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:53,119
Scott: That's it.

929
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,366
Scott: It's as far as you're going to get.

930
00:58:54,587 --> 00:59:05,198
Scott: So if you want to get, say, you know, a little little chant going on, like, ah, phone, ah, you could probably do that with the whole line.

931
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,364
Rym: And it's a lot of fun.

932
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:17,144
Scott: Either one, either one of those activities, either good conversation, the people next to you or your line chance are equally valid and entertaining will become a mini temporary society.

933
00:59:17,706 --> 00:59:22,085
Scott: And if you're the longer it exists, the more indenture that society will become.

934
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:22,306
Scott: Yes.

935
00:59:22,407 --> 00:59:31,635
Rym: And especially like in roller coaster lines, like the cool thing was Cedar Point, like there's pretty much at night when the line was like two hours long because, you know, everyone got in line for like one last ride.

936
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:32,580
Rym: And then it's all night long.

937
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:39,557
Rym: They'd have deejays and music and the line was like, you'd get to know a lot of these people in line because the turnstiles keep passing the same people all the time.

938
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,325
Rym: So one, we play a game.

939
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:42,892
Rym: I forget what we used to call it.

940
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,379
Rym: I think we called it pulling the Jesus.

941
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:50,604
Rym: I don't remember why, but basically make sure that you're talking about something really weird.

942
00:59:50,885 --> 00:59:52,832
Rym: every time you pass this like one person.

943
00:59:54,297 --> 00:59:56,183
Scott: And they'll eventually back and forth line.

944
00:59:56,203 --> 00:59:56,464
Rym: Yes.

945
00:59:56,745 --> 00:59:59,172
Rym: So it's like, turned out Jesus was gay.

946
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:02,782
Rym: And then, yeah, I met him the other night.

947
01:00:02,822 --> 01:00:06,312
Rym: He was a pirate and then the nukes fell.

948
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,656
Rym: Oh my God.

949
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:08,900
Rym: And just go nuts with it.

950
01:00:10,324 --> 01:00:10,464
Rym: Yeah.

951
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:14,802
Rym: The other off is to just completely like bother people, but that's not my bag.

952
01:00:14,983 --> 01:00:15,345
Scott: You know what?

953
01:00:15,385 --> 01:00:17,133
Scott: You know, it really gets me about lines.

954
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:26,238
Scott: It's really like to know more about is how when you finally sort of achieve what you're in the line for, you know, you go in, you buy your iPhone or whatever, you ride the roller coaster and then you get

955
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,062
Rym: out of the line,

956
01:00:27,585 --> 01:00:34,408
Scott: even though you're still next to the people that were just like your closest line friends, like the whole line.

957
01:00:34,428 --> 01:00:35,854
Scott: culture is destroyed.

958
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:37,422
Scott: It's like completely eliminated.

959
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:42,748
Rym: It's like at the end of Lord of the Flies, when you suddenly wake up, you're like, oh, it's just a bunch of kids, right?

960
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:47,996
Scott: It's like if I got like, as soon as I get that, let's say tomorrow, I make really good friends with the person in front of me, right?

961
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,649
Scott: I go in, I buy the iPhone right next to them.

962
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:52,820
Scott: They they're checking out of the checkout next to me.

963
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:53,906
Scott: I buy an iPhone.

964
01:00:53,947 --> 01:00:54,510
Scott: They buy an iPhone.

965
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:55,836
Scott: We both go out on the street.

966
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:57,966
Scott: It's like we're complete strangers again.

967
01:00:58,127 --> 01:00:59,273
Scott: Maybe we'll get a nod.

968
01:00:59,413 --> 01:01:00,096
Scott: That's about it.

969
01:01:00,177 --> 01:01:00,819
Scott: And then we're done.

970
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:02,306
Scott: Yeah, that's how it is.

971
01:01:02,386 --> 01:01:05,922
Rym: And but within the line, like you can become the king of the line while you're in it.

972
01:01:06,907 --> 01:01:08,395
Rym: But then that's gone when you leave the line.

973
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:16,069
Rym: The way to become the king is to be the person that starts the first chain or the first game or the person who instigates a long running game of penis.

974
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:18,798
Scott: Penis, penis, penis.

975
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,646
Rym: We're not going to play this on the air.

976
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:23,216
Scott: Some cool kids are playing penis on the train a week or two ago.

977
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:24,622
Scott: It was good.

978
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:27,835
Rym: I didn't join in because I feel like I'm a bit beyond that.

979
01:01:27,895 --> 01:01:32,675
Scott: But at the same time, I was I had an urge to join in, but also an urge not to join in.

980
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:37,136
Rym: Yes, because it's like on one hand, I ride this train as a businessman and that would be really annoying.

981
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:41,498
Scott: I wanted I wanted some way to show my respect for their game of penis without having to play.

982
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:44,614
Rym: Also, I did not want to engage them because, again, they were also drunk.

983
01:01:44,775 --> 01:01:48,350
Rym: And, you know, once you engage someone, it's difficult to disengage.

984
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:48,952
Scott: That's true.

985
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:54,454
Scott: But I wanted to find I wish there was somebody to show my like not of approval for their game.

986
01:01:54,494 --> 01:01:59,333
Scott: Like I approve of this penis playing on the train without actually involving myself with that.

987
01:01:59,373 --> 01:02:01,162
Rym: Maybe geeks need a symbol, a symbol.

988
01:02:01,202 --> 01:02:07,210
Rym: We use some sort of like a gang hand sign that I do not wish to engage with you, but I approve of what you have done.

989
01:02:07,651 --> 01:02:07,952
Scott: Yes.

990
01:02:08,032 --> 01:02:11,586
Rym: Like you're the awesome or maybe something like you for the win.

991
01:02:11,606 --> 01:02:12,409
Rym: Let's go like that.

992
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:14,092
Scott: The shocker.

993
01:02:14,112 --> 01:02:15,717
Rym: That's not a shocker.

994
01:02:16,379 --> 01:02:18,406
Scott: Why are you putting up the shocker shocker?

995
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:20,352
Rym: That is a shocker.

996
01:02:20,652 --> 01:02:20,913
Scott: Why?

997
01:02:20,973 --> 01:02:22,036
Scott: Why are you giving the shocker?

998
01:02:24,101 --> 01:02:28,473
Rym: You know, as horrible as a shocker is, I like it was a horrible thing.

999
01:02:28,514 --> 01:02:39,233
Rym: But the fact that I don't know how it became such a funny thing and not just in our RIT hockey culture, but geek culture, like people make shocker jokes all the time.

1000
01:02:39,313 --> 01:02:39,856
Rym: And I don't know.

1001
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:43,069
Scott: I don't know why shocker is not just a geek thing.

1002
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:43,612
Scott: It's a. it's a.

1003
01:02:43,813 --> 01:02:47,110
Rym: it's a joke in general, but it's like a lot of geeks have latched on to it.

1004
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:50,118
Rym: Shocker jokes hit FARC like crazy to this day.

1005
01:02:50,138 --> 01:02:51,742
Scott: Yeah, it's the shocker.

1006
01:02:53,908 --> 01:02:54,991
Scott: Who got anything else to say?

1007
01:02:55,011 --> 01:02:57,941
Scott: I'm waiting in line.

1008
01:02:58,383 --> 01:03:01,515
Scott: If you want something real bad and the only way to get it is waiting in line.

1009
01:03:02,258 --> 01:03:05,475
Scott: If you want it badly enough, you're going to get in line early enough to get it.

1010
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:08,273
Scott: If you don't want it badly enough, you're not going to get in line early enough to get it.

1011
01:03:08,293 --> 01:03:09,902
Scott: You might as well not get in line.

1012
01:03:09,982 --> 01:03:11,370
Rym: Bring friends or entertainment.

1013
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:12,353
Rym: Enjoy the line.

1014
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:14,403
Rym: Look at the line as an experience to have fun.

1015
01:03:14,443 --> 01:03:17,904
Rym: If you're not having fun, you're not in the right kind of line or you're not aligned.

1016
01:03:17,944 --> 01:03:18,287
Scott: If you don't.

1017
01:03:18,347 --> 01:03:22,448
Scott: Yeah, if you're not a line person, just don't wait in any lines and just, you know, get your iPhone.

1018
01:03:22,468 --> 01:03:29,699
Rym: If you have to lose your grandeur from now, attempt to become the king of the line, knowing that you have effectively engaged everyone in the line.

1019
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,386
Scott: The best trick, right?

1020
01:03:31,747 --> 01:03:38,633
Scott: Better than becoming the king of the line is becoming the shadow king of the line in which you are in control of the line.

1021
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:42,150
Scott: You have started the chance and such, but no one actually recognizes you.

1022
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,581
Scott: You don't stand out as the king of the line.

1023
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:46,007
Rym: That's kind of like playing solitaire.

1024
01:03:46,027 --> 01:03:47,252
Rym: I took over the line.

1025
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:50,827
Scott: You're in control of the line, but you don't stand out.

1026
01:03:50,887 --> 01:03:52,073
Scott: You're just one of the crowd.

1027
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:53,401
Scott: No one notices you or anything.

1028
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:56,334
Rym: If you have a friend who's in the line somewhere else, there's a good game you can play.

1029
01:03:56,815 --> 01:04:00,326
Rym: Both of you vie to become kings of the line.

1030
01:04:00,346 --> 01:04:02,512
Rym: That's a real good one.

1031
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:10,827
Scott: I stand like a hundred people in, you stand 200 people in, and then I re prearrange like, this is the chance I'm going to try to get started.

1032
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,436
Scott: And this is the chain you were trying to go get started.

1033
01:04:12,758 --> 01:04:14,507
Scott: And we see who gets which chance started.

1034
01:04:14,527 --> 01:04:20,587
Scott: And then maybe they'd like the line will have some sort of a, um, what's it called?

1035
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:27,990
Scott: It might get a little partisan partisan to be like two kings of two different kingdoms in a war.

1036
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,336
Rym: I keep saying king of the line.

1037
01:04:29,356 --> 01:04:30,962
Rym: I guess I should, cause this happens.

1038
01:04:30,983 --> 01:04:34,537
Rym: Like king of the line is something very specific.

1039
01:04:34,577 --> 01:04:36,303
Rym: Quite you that happens.

1040
01:04:36,926 --> 01:04:42,623
Rym: Hey, if I can be anything like Freddie Mercury, but anyway, I'm not going to wear those vests.

1041
01:04:43,887 --> 01:04:44,208
Scott: Why not?

1042
01:04:44,669 --> 01:04:44,930
Rym: I don't know.

1043
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:45,614
Rym: I don't like that.

1044
01:04:45,634 --> 01:04:46,780
Rym: That's not a good style on me.

1045
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,283
Rym: I don't think.

1046
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:54,145
Scott: I think I could wear that yellow vesty thing, but I just have to wear a shirt.

1047
01:04:54,446 --> 01:04:56,895
Rym: King of the line is this very specific phenomenon.

1048
01:04:56,916 --> 01:05:00,997
Rym: And you'll know when someone has achieved it because they'll have done something in the whole crowd.

1049
01:05:01,017 --> 01:05:04,979
Rym: Like maybe they yelled something out funny and then the whole crowd, like looked at them and laughed.

1050
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:10,167
Rym: And you see this in sporting events too, like the king of the section where the one guy yells the clever thing.

1051
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:24,550
Rym: And then everyone, like whenever there's a situation for the rest of the line, for everyone who remembers or the rest of the game where someone should yell something out, you'll notice that half the line will look to whoever was the king of the line, expecting them to say something.

1052
01:05:25,032 --> 01:05:27,824
Scott: I got one more thing to say about an automatic audience.

1053
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:30,173
Scott: Here's one more thing to say about lines, right?

1054
01:05:30,776 --> 01:05:38,484
Scott: Not only should you bring something to entertain yourself with, if you're looking for action in the line itself, bring social currency with you.

1055
01:05:38,644 --> 01:05:39,006
Rym: Yes.

1056
01:05:39,086 --> 01:05:41,415
Scott: Costumes are the best social currency in a line.

1057
01:05:41,435 --> 01:05:48,549
Scott: For example, if I show up tomorrow, dressed like Steve Jobs with a little turtleneck and jeans, totally going to rock the house with that.

1058
01:05:48,589 --> 01:05:49,192
Scott: Someone should do it.

1059
01:05:49,573 --> 01:05:50,537
Scott: Another good idea.

1060
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:52,887
Scott: Show up to a lot, any line.

1061
01:05:52,927 --> 01:05:54,432
Scott: It doesn't matter what the line is for.

1062
01:05:54,754 --> 01:05:55,837
Scott: dressed up like a Jedi.

1063
01:05:55,897 --> 01:05:56,680
Scott: It doesn't matter.

1064
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,810
Scott: Dress up like a Jedi in any line.

1065
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:00,372
Scott: It will work.

1066
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:06,475
Scott: And if it's a Star Wars line, dress up like Star Trek with Spock and some Spock ears will always work.

1067
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:08,361
Scott: Wookiees work in any line.

1068
01:06:08,461 --> 01:06:12,975
Scott: Also Mario and Luigi, they work in most lines.

1069
01:06:13,597 --> 01:06:16,608
Rym: or just, you know, have the, the clever t-shirt of course.

1070
01:06:16,628 --> 01:06:16,829
Rym: Yeah.

1071
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:18,056
Scott: Clever t-shirt is good.

1072
01:06:18,096 --> 01:06:21,153
Scott: If you, if you're not going for the big costume, I tend to go with the clever t-shirt.

1073
01:06:22,338 --> 01:06:25,292
Scott: Typically you want to go with a rare t-shirt, something people haven't seen before.

1074
01:06:25,332 --> 01:06:38,034
Scott: You know, if you have the same funny t-shirt as everyone else from, you know, think geek, it's not going to work, but if you get like, you know, a rare shirt, that's sort of from some weird internet site, like a web comic, that's not too popular, then you're going to hit it off pretty well.

1075
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:48,339
Scott: But yeah, get some social currency, bring something with you, usually clothing or a costume or something that will get you some attention or be a good conversation starter.

1076
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,586
Scott: Cause that's the best way to get stuff going on.

1077
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:52,072
Rym: Also bring a drink.

1078
01:06:52,454 --> 01:06:52,634
Scott: Yeah.

1079
01:06:52,695 --> 01:06:53,297
Scott: Drinks are good.

1080
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:59,179
Scott: Another good example of social currency, especially like a video game line, have a DS from Japan.

1081
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:00,162
Scott: That's a different color.

1082
01:07:00,443 --> 01:07:09,492
Scott: or bring an imported DS game with you or, you know, something along those lines and you'll get some conversations out of that.

1083
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:14,372
Rym: So, for the eye of the line tomorrow, of course you're going to bring that Apple G2.

1084
01:07:15,175 --> 01:07:16,158
Rym: Just carry it on your back.

1085
01:07:16,238 --> 01:07:18,847
Scott: I bring my G2 with me to get my iPhone.

1086
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:19,730
Scott: No, I'm not.

1087
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,660
Scott: I'm just going to bring my usual shit to work.

1088
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,897
Scott: I have a funny t-shirt and my normal stuff, a digital camera, you know, whatever.

1089
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,868
Rym: If anyone out there listening brings an Apple G2.

1090
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:33,052
Scott: Of course I'm going to be ripping out my super Linux-y laptop right in the middle of all the Mac books.

1091
01:07:34,157 --> 01:07:35,282
Scott: That's what I got going on.

1092
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:37,169
Rym: Alright, this episode went nowhere.

1093
01:07:37,189 --> 01:07:37,650
Rym: We're done.

1094
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:38,651
Scott: We're done.

1095
01:07:45,397 --> 01:07:47,599
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1096
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:50,163
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1097
01:07:50,845 --> 01:08:02,185

1098
01:08:02,626 --> 01:08:08,328
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1099
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:10,477
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1100
01:08:10,517 --> 01:08:13,147
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1101
01:08:13,509 --> 01:08:18,991
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1102
01:08:19,372 --> 01:08:27,537
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1103
01:08:27,798 --> 01:08:31,095
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

1104
01:08:31,377 --> 01:08:36,479

1108

Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1109
01:08:57,698 --> 01:09:00,819
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
