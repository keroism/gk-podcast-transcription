8
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:47,290
Rym: Right now at this moment while you were listening to GeekNights We actually recorded a little bit ahead something we don't do often something we say we'll do all the time.

10
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:55,369
Rym: We're like, alright, let's watch like a ton of crappy anime Do like four anime shows and then nothing happens.

11
00:00:56,032 --> 00:01:02,196
Rym: Once we were a whole week ahead on the show and that lasted about one week and then we blew all those extra episodes like Right away.

Rym: Yeah, we went off the road and decided we'll never have to go up the road again.

33
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:55,510
Scott: Maybe bought some paper.

34
00:01:55,934 --> 00:02:00,943
Rym: Yeah, I have discovered that there's now Nothing in the world left that will cause me to go to a mall.

00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:02,309
Scott: Yeah, what do I need?

00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:03,516
Scott: I don't need to go to anywhere.

00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,630
Rym: I forgot all about that.

46
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:35,070
Rym: They'll find out.

Scott: I mean, I Only they'll listen no matter what.

53
00:02:57,358 --> 00:02:59,325
Scott: and if we tell them see is the thing right.

54
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:01,955
Scott: if we tell them who it is And they're excited about it.

55
00:03:02,276 --> 00:03:02,999
Scott: They will listen.

56
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:18,790
Scott: if I tell them who it is and they're not excited about it They might skip that one All right, but if we tell them we're interviewing someone awesome or someone we think is awesome, then they're gonna listen Even if you know we tell them who it is, you know, we'll get more listeners if we're vague about it.

57
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,413
Scott: That's what I'm thinking.

58
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:20,961
Rym: Well, I gave some hints last week.

59
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:21,825
Rym: I'm sure they all forgot.

60
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:22,910
Rym: I'll give one more hint tonight.

61
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:28,290
Scott: No, no hints are necessary because then a hint is basically either doesn't help them figure out at all.

62
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:31,318
Rym: No, it might tantalize what.

63
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:34,870
Scott: what hint could tantalize without giving it away or being too mysterious.

64
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,288
Rym: doors perhaps?

65
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,379
Rym: Okay, they're their doors involved.

66
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,562
Rym: Whatever there are yeah You know, I don't think you understand how excited I am about doors.

67
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:48,510
Scott: I think you're too excited about doors.

68
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,975
Rym: It's the best part is having doors.

69
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:52,163
Rym: Okay, nothing's better than having a door.

70
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:53,930
Scott: You want to do a news, right?

71
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,802
Rym: So this is on slash John.

72
00:03:55,822 --> 00:04:10,570
Rym: a lot of people are talking about it But there was an interesting correlation in the Iowa caucuses by the way if you weren't paying attention my man Barack Obama won and I give him a 51% chance of getting the Democratic nomination for the race for the president in the u.s

73
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,492
Scott: Sounds about right

74
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:16,245
Rym: and I think after Monday that chance is either gonna go up to a good 80% or go way down

75
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:18,974
Scott: New Hampshire's tomorrow.

76
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:19,697
Rym: I think so.

77
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:20,118
Rym: Uh-huh.

78
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,490
Rym: Everything's super weird and early this year because it's all messed up.

79
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:27,830
Scott: I know I cut the news almost completely ignored that fact like all that weird stuff that happened.

80
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:28,474
Rym: No, they didn't.

81
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:29,723
Rym: the news talked about it constantly.

82
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:31,233
Rym: You just don't watch the news I don't like.

83
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:32,198
Scott: Google News didn't say anything.

84
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:32,842
Rym: Yes, they did.

85
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:34,330
Rym: It was in all the newspapers.

86
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:38,549
Rym: I didn't see any mostly last year because this has been fomenting for quite some time.

87
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:41,458
Scott: Well, it seems to have gone off without any actual problems.

88
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:44,687
Rym: Michigan effectively removed itself from the primary process.

89
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:46,092
Rym: way to go I try.

90
00:04:46,173 --> 00:04:49,186
Rym: they tried to become more important and as a result now they don't matter at all.

91
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:50,029
Scott: Good job.

92
00:04:50,351 --> 00:05:00,329
Rym: Luckily, I vote in New York where it kind of matters Kind of the primary it definitely does Because one person has a distinct advantage and the other person is the one I'm voting for.

93
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:03,150
Scott: Aha, I guess that might make a small difference.

94
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,470
Scott: I think my vote counts considering how few people vote in primaries and it maybe maybe it does.

95
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,874
Rym: Yeah, that I'd better count.

96
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,550
Rym: I've high registered for the stupid Democratic Party just so I could vote in their stupid primary.

97
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:18,092
Scott: I stuck with my undeclared Declaration.

98
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:20,441
Rym: I'm going back to Golisano's party right after this business.

99
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:22,368
Scott: Oh, you're actually gonna register for the Independence Party.

100
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:22,789
Rym: I think so.

101
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:30,955
Rym: Oh, no before I was the libertarian but as much as I like the ideals of libertarianism Libertarianism not so great.

102
00:05:31,316 --> 00:05:38,758
Scott: I think they call themselves the Independence Party just so people would accidentally register with them Trying to declare being independent.

103
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,930
Rym: a friend of mine Aaron Arty was in a band Tell this story in our high school.

104
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:51,070
Rym: I know one special and and the band was called nobody's special because you know Our clubs work for crap little bands is when you walk in you pay the cover charge.

105
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:56,227
Rym: They ask you who you're here to see and if you say whatever name of a band that's playing then they get.

106
00:05:56,267 --> 00:06:00,290
Rym: that increases their Percentage of whatever amount of money they get paid for bringing people to the car.

107
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,776
Scott: At least it helps that band out.

108
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:05,230
Scott: it increases the likelihood that they'll bring that band back to the club again.

109
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,127
Rym: But this particular club they paid out based on how many people said they came to see you.

110
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:09,489
Rym: Mm-hmm.

111
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:13,801
Rym: So, of course they named their van nobody's special to try and game that.

112
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:15,426
Rym: so I remember.

113
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:19,982
Rym: I showed up and I was gonna see Their van for the first time and they said who you're here to see.

114
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:21,990
Rym: and I said nobody in particular.

115
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:23,748
Rym: Yeah, just to be a jerk.

116
00:06:25,872 --> 00:06:30,030
Rym: Of course that was the same night where I was mistaken by two individual people for a drug dealer.

117
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:41,910
Rym: Nice, if two people came up to me and they're like, hey and they tried to buy drugs from me and the first one I'm like, uh, I think you have me mistaken for someone else and the second time I was like, ha ha ha.

118
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,799
Rym: Yes, I'll sell you drugs.

119
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,744
Rym: Ha ha ha.

120
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:45,909
Rym: then like no, I don't have any drugs.

121
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:50,418
Rym: I Was like, yeah, I only got cocaine.

122
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:51,883
Scott: What exactly they say to you.

123
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:56,005
Rym: They were the first one was like, hey I heard you had some merbs.

124
00:06:57,391 --> 00:06:58,988
Scott: Yeah, I got some parsley out back.

125
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:05,095
Scott: Oh Maybe some pencil shavings Shavings in a bag.

126
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:10,769
Rym: I think the problem was I was dressed in all black and a trench coat and I wasn't up for That wasn't my kind of club scene.

127
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:16,144
Rym: So I was kind of standing in the back of the room not dancing just watching the band.

128
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:17,448
Rym: Yeah myself.

129
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:21,686
Scott: Yeah Yeah way to do a drug dealer impersonation exit.

130
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:22,570
Scott: Okay news time.

131
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,981
Rym: So in the Iowa caucuses someone noticed that.

132
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,225
Scott: are you doing this news on Tuesday?

133
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:28,550
Rym: This is kind of relevant here.

134
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:35,116
Rym: okay, so in the caucus if someone noticed that there is a strong correlation between Candidates stances on video games.

135
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:39,349
Rym: Aha the Tuesday ness and how well they did in the caucus.

136
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,097
Rym: now I'm not gonna explain how a caucus works other than that.

137
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:43,542
Rym: It is different from a primary.

138
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,067
Rym: Scott didn't know any.

139
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:46,030
Scott: I knew enough.

140
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,255
Scott: No, you didn't I did.

141
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:48,902
Scott: You just thought I didn't know.

142
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,147
Rym: you didn't know Jack.

143
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:50,649
Scott: I know enough.

144
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:56,270
Rym: Anyway, so I want to point out I want to talk about this very much that you know.

145
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,977
Rym: People are making kind of a big deal about this.

146
00:07:58,057 --> 00:08:00,990
Rym: No, maybe video games matter now, and that's totally not true.

147
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:15,094
Rym: What happened here is very simple Politicians who don't care about video games Obviously are smart enough to realize more so than other people what positions matter and what positions don't or For whatever reasons.

148
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:19,190
Rym: like they recognize that video games is not something that should be even talked about by politicians.

149
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,712
Rym: It shouldn't.

150
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,617
Rym: it shouldn't come up ever.

151
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:21,541
Rym: There's no reason.

152
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:23,269
Scott: Yeah, how do you feel about?

153
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,453
Scott: Television?

154
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:25,898
Scott: how do you feel about movies?

155
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,082
Scott: How do you feel about radio?

156
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:29,210
Scott: Yeah, that's not a big deal.

157
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:38,124
Scott: You know for the president of the United States he has to worry about war war But video games real war.

158
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,370
Scott: which one's more important?

159
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:53,843
Rym: I don't know one obviously video games young people people our age and younger voted in well, I guess voted doesn't really work but showed up in record numbers for this caucus and Young people if there's a caucus in your area, it's fun.

160
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:55,530
Scott: You should go even if you don't care cuz it's fun.

161
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,589
Rym: I think I was the only state that has caucuses.

162
00:08:58,032 --> 00:08:58,956
Scott: I think so, but it's still.

163
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:02,209
Scott: they could be a caucus for something else besides, you know, choose, you know.

164
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:10,930
Rym: They're only fun if you care a lot about politics It's four hours of people trying to convince you to stand in one corner of the room or the other corner.

165
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,735
Rym: But it's catered.

166
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,406
Rym: not always now.

167
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:13,688
Scott: Fuck it.

168
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:22,986
Rym: Sometimes I've seen I've heard tell of caucuses from old political professors professors at RIT back in the day that were Shall we say full of?

169
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,460
Rym: Beverages that may not have been conducive to the democratic process.

170
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,350
Scott: There's a most excellent variety of caucus.

171
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:37,316
Rym: But what happened here was that I think there is no correlation between Video games the correlation.

172
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:38,861
Rym: Well, there's no causation.

173
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:45,823
Scott: exact a video game stands and being voted Going to a particular the corner of the room based upon video games.

174
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:50,270
Scott: unless someone had like a DS in one corner of the Room, then they might have gotten someone over there.

175
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:57,933
Rym: But if I had a caucus there would be the awesome snacks and a Wii and a button a ps3 and an Xbox in the one Corner, they're not.

176
00:09:58,053 --> 00:10:05,576
Rym: Yeah, I just some rickety chairs and an angry dog in the other corner With the DS is in the Rym corner.

177
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:07,120
Scott: Is that sort of cheating?

178
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:07,662
Scott: Yes.

179
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:09,707
Rym: Okay, you can do whatever you want.

180
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:10,570
Rym: Caucuses are crazy.

181
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:12,045
Scott: Can you really do whatever you want?

182
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:12,530
Rym: pretty much?

183
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,110
Scott: Can I just like give a dollar to everyone who agrees to stand in my corner?

184
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,320
Rym: You could probably get away with it.

185
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:23,639
Rym: really, you know Theoretically a lot of people who aren't legally able to vote deal in the caucuses because there's no way to know your 14 year old Son could be there.

186
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,057
Rym: Yeah Legally, they're not allowed to talk they can only observe.

187
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,140
Rym: but yeah that happens.

188
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,781
Scott: Awesome.

189
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:32,050
Rym: Anyway, there is no real causation here.

190
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,950
Rym: What happened was in my opinion, though?

191
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,048
Rym: I think this is pretty solid.

192
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:45,126
Rym: Candidates who don't care about video games are probably also more in line with the kind of more not so much radical But just what the younger crowd cares about.

193
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:51,050
Rym: the more hip Politicians the ones who don't care about the old man fuddy-duddy business and young people voted a lot.

194
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:58,310
Rym: So there's probably strong correlation between people who appeal to young voters and people who independently of that don't care about video games.

195
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:00,459
Scott: I mean do care no don't care.

196
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:07,830
Rym: You know, no one says yeah video games Politicians either don't say cuz they don't give a shit or they act like video games of the devil.

197
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:13,159
Rym: No, okay If you don't care about video games You're probably a better more hip politician and you probably.

198
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:16,190
Rym: your stance is probably aligned more with the younger generations.

199
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:21,510
Rym: Okay, as a result B-rock is doing mighty fine among video game fans.

200
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:24,644
Rym: I like how one of the tags on slashed out for the story is stupid.

201
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,246
Rym: post-hoc.

202
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:27,015
Scott: Yeah Great.

203
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,127
Rym: So what do you got for me?

204
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:33,370
Scott: Okay, now Rym gave a little Thursday news that he turned into a Tuesday news.

205
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:37,064
Scott: I'm gonna give you a little Monday news like a turn into Tuesday news right for this.

206
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:41,137
Scott: Okay, so we know Software patents, they're stupid.

207
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,182
Scott: They shouldn't be there.

208
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:44,526
Scott: It's like that parrot.

209
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:45,528
Scott: It shouldn't be.

210
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:49,082
Rym: yeah The best thing is we we have a friend now who works.

211
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:49,805
Rym: probably shouldn't be.

212
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:57,250
Rym: we've had this friend for a long time But this person works it with patents and we have heard straight from the horse's mouth that software patents are bullshit.

213
00:11:57,753 --> 00:12:04,464
Rym: Yes from someone who knows something from my patent examiner Maybe maybe possibly possible who may or may not know more about patents than us.

214
00:12:04,564 --> 00:12:05,768
Scott: Maybe maybe someone?

215
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:15,033
Scott: okay Basically, there was a news story in 2004. my a guy named Sheldon Goldberg sounds like a Jew, but I'm Jewish It's not.

216
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:16,060
Scott: I'm not saying that racist Lee.

217
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:17,249
Scott: I'm saying it actually sounds like a Jew.

218
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:23,674
Scott: and There's a. there's a place called as a website called the troll tracker Which is a which is a tracker.

219
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:31,217
Scott: the tracks patent trolls and well this guy way back when he had like some patents or Solitaire like computer solitaire.

220
00:12:31,237 --> 00:12:35,630
Scott: This guy was yelling in 2004 that his patents covered solitaire.

221
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:37,759
Rym: Yeah, and we might have even talked about this.

222
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:39,305
Scott: I don't know me my I don't know.

223
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,575
Scott: We didn't make a show in 2004 I didn't say on the show.

224
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:42,822
Rym: I said we might have talked about it.

225
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:44,510
Rym: Okay, I'm sure we talked about.

226
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:51,622
Scott: he also has some patents for a network gaming system and Another patent for a method for playing games on a network.

227
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:51,802
Rym: Yeah.

228
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:53,268
Rym: Well, I've got a patent for your mom.

229
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:57,099
Scott: Yeah So this guy is a lot of crapo patents, right?

230
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,170
Scott: Well this guy finally bust it out.

231
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:08,933
Scott: He's suing among others doing everyone dig Google AOL Yahoo Maybe Microsoft.

232
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:09,315
Scott: I don't know.

233
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,950
Scott: I didn't see Microsoft on the list, but they might be there and he's suing.

234
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,614
Scott: I know.

235
00:13:13,674 --> 00:13:14,821
Scott: I don't know why you sue and dig.

236
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:15,686
Scott: that's sort of out of nowhere.

237
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:16,450
Scott: But you know what?

238
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,309
Rym: I think he's a lot like remember in Futurama the one about Lila and her past and all that.

239
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:32,190
Rym: and There were the story of the mole people who because they were blind and they couldn't see well They couldn't see very well and they were at war with someone and they just basically fired missiles in every direction.

240
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,730
Scott: He's suing New York Times Washington Post CNET tribune interactive and e-bombs world.

241
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:44,810
Scott: You know e-bombs world deserves it, but everyone else he's suing all these people with these lame lame patents.

242
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:49,144
Scott: So if you're some video gaming person right the software patents affect you to.

243
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,615
Scott: video games are Software people are gonna be.

244
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:58,141
Scott: if these software patent things that you probably don't care about only caring about games Happen and go through and this bullshit happens.

245
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:00,470
Scott: People are gonna start patenting video games.

246
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,530
Scott: I mean, it's already bad enough that like EA is the only person only company allowed to make a football game.

247
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:12,250
Scott: Imagine if you know, uh, I don't know Activision was the only company allowed to make an RTS because they patented that shit.

248
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:13,529
Scott: It's bad news.

249
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:20,270
Scott: Imagine if this guy wins and suddenly he's the only one in the world allowed to make networked games or networked gaming systems.

250
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:22,065
Scott: It's bad news.

251
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:29,167
Rym: luckily Also what we've learned from our friends that may or may not exist at the patent examination office.

252
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,010
Rym: Is that perhaps?

253
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,685
Rym: Everyone there is smart and knows the deal and are doing their best to fix every.

254
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:41,963
Scott: well some of the people there The thing is none of them have really enough power because there's their view into this.

255
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:44,270
Scott: myth is thousands of thousands of patent examiners.

256
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,164
Scott: Yeah, well, I maybe not a thousand but there's a lot of them.

257
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:56,049
Scott: There's a whole bunch It's like seven now and each one of them, you know views patents from such a small Topic area and there are so many patents.

258
00:14:56,656 --> 00:15:03,230
Scott: So it's like if you're a patent examiner You might be looking at something so ludicrously specific like some topic that is just so small.

259
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:06,489
Scott: That's the only thing you really have the power over, you know.

260
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:13,495
Scott: So yeah Yeah, if you're some gamer and you're not caring about the tech issues Look the tech issues affect you.

261
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:14,437
Scott: your games run.

262
00:15:14,558 --> 00:15:16,904
Scott: video games run on technology.

263
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:19,050
Scott: things that affect technology affect your games.

264
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:20,449
Scott: You need to pay attention.

265
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:27,201
Scott: Intellectual property patents all this bullshit affects you too And if you don't watch out for it soon games can be fucked up.

266
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:30,789
Rym: Like if this guy wins bad news luckily He's not gonna win.

267
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,549
Scott: There's no way this guy is gonna win.

268
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:40,700
Scott: The Google alone has enough money to just put him out of his misery and a straight legal battle without any You know doesn't matter what his lawyers say.

269
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,070
Rym: I'm pretty sure they'll just money them out of business.

270
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,140
Rym: I'm pretty sure I could win in a patent battle against this dude.

271
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:55,621
Scott: probably probably but yeah patent trolls are out there and They're starting to spread into other areas besides just you know Hindering the open source type peoples.

272
00:15:56,024 --> 00:16:01,250
Rym: So I got one more news I want to talk about briefly might do a show or something in the future about this, but I think it's kind of cool.

273
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:03,032
Rym: Straight from slash shot.

274
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:13,047
Rym: a New Zealand physicist has written a paper recently saying that scientists should seriously explore the possibility of The of the universe being a giant virtual reality simulation.

275
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:16,147
Scott: in other words He wants to make sure where it's not the matrix or that it is.

276
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:16,550
Scott: now

277
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:39,169
Rym: The thing is this is really interesting because if you look at quantum theory and what happens at low levels There's kind of this idea that things don't seem to exist until we observe them and it's kind of scary How that happens when you look at hot like quantum particle interactions and things aren't there but then they're there or they interact with things that aren't there anymore and all this weird stuff.

278
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:59,910
Rym: and one way that this could be explained is that the universe is being generated by some sort of system that is Quantizing an unquantized thing kind of like when you have the RAM deck, you know, I'm recording my voice It's all digital for you But when I record it, it's analog and hits a box that basically breaks it up into a bunch of discrete bits.

279
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:06,690
Rym: And of course not all the information of my voice could possibly be done because there's an infinite amount of data there theoretically.

280
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:12,088
Rym: But at the same time I can get pretty damn close and it's possible that the universe is the same way.

281
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:18,790
Rym: now It's not necessarily that an intelligent thing is simulating the universe or that it's a game or anything like that.

282
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:21,150
Rym: It could be a natural phenomenon or something.

283
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:24,439
Rym: It's an idea that he's saying we should look into.

284
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,329
Scott: I say we should look into every idea all the time.

285
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,916
Scott: That's what you know, you have hypothesis.

286
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:30,619
Scott: test them all.

287
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,844
Scott: they haven't been tested yet.

288
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:32,627
Scott: Why not?

289
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:37,495
Scott: Sure It makes as much sense as any other crazy string theory things, you know I guess.

290
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,111
Scott: the other interesting thing is you look it's you know Like.

291
00:17:40,433 --> 00:18:03,597
Scott: it makes a lot of sense when you start to think about how we make software like if I make a video game right like say Mario right well in the game of Mario I need to have all the data for what all the maps look like and all the bad guys are right and But only a small part of that is actually on the screen at a given time, you know The part you're looking at right now.

292
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:14,450
Scott: So to make the game go faster I mean I could have you know The game process the entire world map all the time kind of like how what dwarf fortress does that?

293
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,041
Scott: Yeah, look at you play half-life.

294
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:20,570
Scott: right in half-life You can have the whole game map in the memory all the time.

295
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:31,410
Scott: But instead of doing that Every once in a while it says loading and it unloads the map behind you and loads the map in front of you Because it would be too slow even I think a more apt example like in quake 2 back in the day.

296
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:46,410
Rym: There was a whole system setup where it would only render or bother rendering things that it knew you could see and it Everything else in the map didn't exist Except as abstract data until you viewed it and then suddenly it got rendered.

297
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:54,614
Scott: Yep cuz I mean why if it's you could have the computer render things that you are not currently on screen and it would just Slow the game down.

298
00:18:54,674 --> 00:19:04,850
Scott: so it might be that the universe works in this way where things are only Things only come into existence and matter when they're being observed or doing something.

299
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,382
Rym: plus I mean look at a game like half-life.

300
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:07,390
Rym: It has a physics engine.

301
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:14,917
Rym: The engine is not infinitely granular it only gets down to a certain point and it suffices real well And it's pretty damn realistic.

302
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:24,549
Rym: and we can simulate all sorts of things on the macro level Because things that events on the micro level are so insignificant that they're effectively meaningless for most of what we would do.

303
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:27,066
Rym: And theoretically the real world could be the same way.

304
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:31,210
Rym: now I find it interesting that he even has an idea of how to test this hypothesis.

305
00:19:31,675 --> 00:19:33,150
Scott: How does he think we're gonna test this hypothesis?

306
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:37,729
Scott: This is like a hypothetical hypothesis, but theoretically you mean like every hypothesis.

307
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:55,863
Rym: well Theoretically if we wanted to test this if we could ever find a task that information processing Itself like the idea of information processing cannot handle and yet we can do it in the real world Then as far as our knowledge of information processing is gone.

308
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:56,304
Rym: I've gone.

309
00:19:56,505 --> 00:19:57,248
Rym: we have disproven it.

310
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,928
Rym: That's as good as he seems to be able to come up with right now.

311
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:02,577
Scott: It's a little weak.

312
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,606
Rym: see the thing is I always found it fast.

313
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:17,066
Rym: there is that theory I think I've talked about this before that theoretically if we could perfectly model the physics of our world like we could make a computer simulation that Perfectly modeled to the point that it was exactly as the real world any so all our physics.

314
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:17,748
Rym: then.

315
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:23,669
Rym: theoretically the odds are that we exist inside of a simulation because of all the infinite possibilities and all that.

316
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:31,257
Rym: and That can only be disproven by the also possible idea that information processing Requires energy.

317
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:39,810
Rym: and it's possible that sure you can simulate physics But to simulate the entirety of physics requires the energy output of the entirety of physics.

318
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:56,450
Rym: Yep, we'll find out eventually Hopefully things of the day, so I'm sure you all remember and love the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

319
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:58,769
Scott: Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

320
00:21:00,754 --> 00:21:07,390
Rym: We're the Mario bro, okay, it's enough of that but Everyone remembers that most kids, you know, we watched the Mario show we tolerated.

321
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:10,080
Scott: Oh, you're gonna use this horrible thing for your thing today.

322
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:22,824
Rym: Oh God what we cared about was the the Legend of Zelda cartoon that only played on Friday and That show when I was a kid was great.

323
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:26,350
Scott: when I was a kid It was great and I look forward to it cuz it was hot.

324
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,430
Scott: It was like this thing that was on so rarely.

325
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:39,804
Scott: it seemed like because you know, the only way you could watch something was if it was on TV and TV dictated and what you could and couldn't watch and VHS tapes, you know You might have had a VCR but you didn't own too many tapes.

326
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:40,770
Scott: You couldn't own a whole lot.

327
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,490
Scott: So when something wasn't on TV often it was like a special treat.

328
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,515
Scott: That was like Saturday morning.

329
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:49,047
Scott: cartoons are so great cuz like x-men cartoon.

330
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:52,490
Scott: when that was on The only way to see it was Saturday morning.

331
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,032
Scott: That was it.

332
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:53,715
Scott: once a week.

333
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:54,438
Rym: was all you got?

334
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,470
Rym: unless you just were smart and programmed your VCR.

335
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:00,865
Scott: You needed blank tapes then, you know how many blank tapes we had.

336
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,030
Scott: we didn't have so many.

337
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:03,606
Rym: Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.

338
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:11,878
Scott: We recorded and usually my parents would use them to record something like a movie or something that was on long and then They would never record over it again.

339
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:12,721
Rym: See we did.

340
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:14,970
Rym: and also we made the the day killers.

341
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:19,050
Rym: We recorded every episode of every show we watched and then without commercials.

342
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:21,295
Rym: Yeah, remember those things.

343
00:22:21,356 --> 00:22:25,110
Rym: any time we wanted to kill an entire day at RIT just put in a tape.

344
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:29,905
Rym: That's like 30 episodes of The Simpsons with no commercial breaks openers or closers.

345
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:31,490
Rym: It's just one long string of Simpsons.

346
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:36,270
Scott: You put that thing in and nobody will move or they'll just be a gibbering mess.

347
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,577
Rym: Now one thing about this show.

348
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:43,269
Rym: is that it these shows actually did one thing really well that I'm surprised.

349
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:52,560
Rym: more Kids shows that are about video games that sort of thing do is that most shows about video games don't actually have anything to do With the video game at all and the kids watching.

350
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,162
Rym: I remember as a kid.

351
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:55,636
Rym: I'd see shows like Captain N. I'd go wait a minute.

352
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:56,705
Rym: That's not how it was in the game.

353
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:57,350
Rym: This is bullshit.

354
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,193
Scott: That's what I said.

355
00:22:58,213 --> 00:23:04,537
Rym:  but this show and the Super Mario Show and that one Sonic show that I liked I like the other Sonic show.

356
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:05,120
Rym: you suck.

357
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,910
Rym: I like Sonic Underground - you can go to hell.

358
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,455
Rym: He's a Sonic Underground is awesome.

359
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:10,402
Scott: You never even watched a single episode of Sonic.

360
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:12,930
Rym: You know what the idea of it is so awesome?

361
00:23:13,051 --> 00:23:13,615
Scott: No, it's not.

362
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:13,695
Rym: Yes.

363
00:23:13,736 --> 00:23:14,098
Scott: It is.

364
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,689
Scott: It's Sonic the Hedgehog Sonic.

365
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:18,996
Scott: That's the good one.

366
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:20,647
Rym: I'm all about Sonic Lura bell.

367
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:32,872
Rym: no so the show as I know being older is not that good because the one thing is if the 90s were like the early 90s mid 90s were epitomized by the Zack Morris cool kid and the Zack Morris Ideology.

368
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:38,630
Rym: the 80s were defined by the link from the Legend of Zelda ideology.

369
00:23:39,471 --> 00:23:42,565
Rym: 90s kids were cool and caused trouble but not real harmful trouble.

370
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:43,810
Rym: They didn't kill anyone or anything.

371
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,308
Rym: They just you know, there were those troublemakers that showed up late to class and were snarky like Bueller.

372
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:50,762
Rym: Bueller Even though he was 80s, but he was ahead of his time.

373
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:51,224
Scott: He was ahead of us.

374
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:52,090
Scott: That was why he's so great.

375
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:55,762
Rym: Yeah, but uh, he said that he said the model 80s things.

376
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:59,896
Rym: everyone was a brat bastard not most of them.

377
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:03,529
Rym: most like characters and shows were just self-entitled whiny little bitches.

378
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:20,250
Rym: and while the Super Mario Show and the Zelda show were so close to the games and just to the point that that was actually a Detriment in the long run, but like all the items were the same the sound effects were the same And I think that's the reason most kids like these shows and have such nostalgia for them is that it was the game.

379
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,156
Rym: I played the game.

380
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:23,450
Scott: Let's see the Mario live-action movie.

381
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,370
Scott: The reason it was so bad is because it wasn't anything like the video game.

382
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:32,090
Scott: I like the video game and they just took the words from the video game and plastered them on something else.

383
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:39,201
Rym: In fact, if the Super Mario movie with John Leguizamo had been Not a Mario movie, but it just been that movie without Mario.

384
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:44,378
Rym: I think I would have liked it a lot more more Complete hate.

385
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:48,870
Rym: Yes, it had a Funny moments and it it did do one thing, right?

386
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:54,370
Rym: That is one of the few pieces of media ever that has treated the Bob-omb with the proper level of respect.

387
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:55,113
Scott: That is true.

388
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:59,209
Rym: But other than that, no nothing the movies almost worth watching for that one scene.

389
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:02,247
Scott: Just watch the one scene on YouTube if you can find it.

390
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:06,090
Rym: Oh, yeah I'm sure you can find it and I don't know what the deal was with Big Bertha in that movie.

391
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:11,003
Scott: Yeah, but these are the only cartoons that actually respected the source material and were truthful to it.

392
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:20,710
Rym: However, um, you might remember that Everyone was a bratty little bitch and link was often found to say, you know, his catchphrase happened like in every episode.

393
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,755
Rym: Well, excuse me Princess.

394
00:25:23,996 --> 00:25:26,810
Scott: Yeah watching this show now Rym seems to still like this show.

395
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:31,003
Rym: I like it only to watch in a group of people because it's hilarious watching it.

396
00:25:31,023 --> 00:25:32,227
Rym: It's not hilarious.

397
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:33,130
Scott: It's just painful.

398
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,354
Scott: It's like watching he-man.

399
00:25:34,414 --> 00:25:34,976
Scott: It's bad.

400
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:36,622
Rym: watching it in a group is really fun.

401
00:25:36,642 --> 00:25:39,030
Rym: No, I don't know why Scott's so humdrum about it.

402
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:49,324
Rym: Every time I've had a bunch of friends over and we have watched the Zelda show Scott goes The whole time and everyone else is laughing their goddamn asses off.

403
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:50,388
Scott: It's terrible.

404
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:55,540
Rym: So this is a video of Every single time.

405
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:02,390
Rym: the link says well Excuse me princess in the show and I want to point out one thing frightening.

406
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:07,330
Rym: There were only 13 episodes of this show and this is kind of a long video.

407
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:13,250
Rym: He averages and excuse me princess about every six and a half minutes sound like that.

408
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:14,533
Scott: He says it a lot.

409
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:15,336
Rym: Good God.

410
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:16,058
Rym: Yeah.

411
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:18,485
Scott: Also, I always remember the early 90s in the 80s.

412
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,070
Scott: They're all about catchphrases.

413
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:21,617
Scott: I mean don't have a cow man.

414
00:26:21,637 --> 00:26:22,219
Rym: You buy.

415
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,430
Scott: sure I caramba eat my shorts.

416
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:27,206
Scott: Those are all from the same show, but that doesn't matter.

417
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:27,910
Rym: No, it's chocolate.

418
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:36,889
Rym: The only thing I remember watching the show again is it link sword was really kind of stubby.

419
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:42,614
Rym: I guess I didn't notice that as a kid, but now as an adult is true to the video game It's kind of an act in.

420
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:44,580
Rym: uh, it's kind of disappointing.

421
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:47,730
Rym: I think Lionel's sword is much more impressive Lionel.

422
00:26:47,891 --> 00:26:49,877
Scott: Yeah, Lionel is a train.

423
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:53,047
Rym: now if you took a sword and put it on a train sword train.

424
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:57,259
Rym: It's our train Right next to the soul train right next to the night train.

425
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:57,801
Rym: Okay.

426
00:26:58,022 --> 00:26:58,363
Rym: All right.

427
00:26:58,745 --> 00:27:01,716
Scott: I got another Monday thing I'm gonna turn into a Tuesday thing.

428
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:03,362
Scott: Here is the video.

429
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:04,426
Scott: in this video.

430
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:09,441
Scott: You will see an IBM model 5150 PC.

431
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:15,030
Scott: This is the first PC the first like personal computer could have your house like an 8080 processor.

432
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,890
Scott: It's an 8086 like you know how you know.

433
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:33,352
Scott: We talked about the 386 the 286 the 386 and the 486 right and then the 586 And then every chip that you're using today is a 686. pretty much all these Intel chips in the max all these AMD chips They're all.

434
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:38,049
Scott: 686 is unless you have one of those power PC max in which case it's a power PC.

435
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:39,858
Rym: Well in which case you went down there.

436
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,410
Rym: if you bought a newer one, you kind of went down the wrong path.

437
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:45,985
Scott: But yeah, anyway, it's a 686 in your computer.

438
00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:46,246
Scott: Now.

439
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:49,717
Scott: This is an 8080. that's a 080 after the 8080.

440
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:55,257
Scott: I don't know I don't remember if it was 80 81 80 82, but it was 80 86. then there was 186 286 386 46 and etc.

441
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,714
Scott: This is the first one.

442
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:04,141
Scott: This is the oldest PC the oldest one.

443
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:06,729
Scott: Anyway, it's really slow and shitty.

444
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:24,450
Scott: It's got 640k of RAM a 10 megabyte hard drive that's less than 10 floppy disks worth to five and a quarter inch floppy drives 4.7 so less than 5 megahertz and CGA graphics, right.

445
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:36,284
Scott: Some guy wrote a program for this computer and he got this computer to play 30 frames per second of CGA Full-color motion video.

446
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:39,810
Rym: I am sure there's some pot pallet swapping going on in here.

447
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:45,490
Scott: There's all sorts of clever programming techniques going on, you know on the lowest levels of the machines.

448
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:51,950
Scott: You know depths of scary assembly languageness to get it to do this, but there's this huge scene.

449
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:57,986
Scott: I don't know if the scene is shrunk in recent years But it's called the demo scene and the demo scene or all these people.

450
00:28:58,026 --> 00:29:00,446
Scott: they make demos But not demos in the sense of.

451
00:29:00,487 --> 00:29:04,909
Scott: you know I'm gonna make the first level of the video game free and the rest of the video game you have to pay for.

452
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:12,130
Scott: We're talking demos as in a program that demonstrates the full capabilities of a piece of hardware, right?

453
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:26,568
Scott: They get a computer and they writes they optimize and optimize and optimize some assembly language program that pushes The CPU and the GPU and whatever other chips are in the computer to do the most they can possibly do.

454
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:32,009
Scott: and well This is a lot easier to do for older computers, which are have much simpler chips in them.

455
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:37,910
Scott: But when they do it you you'd be amazed at the things that really simple computers can do.

456
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,165
Scott: I mean go look at some like Apple to demos or some like 286 demos.

457
00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:46,690
Scott: Those computers can do some crazy-ass shit when the programs are actually optimized.

458
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:53,274
Scott: So this video shows you you know, it's a pretty good demo of a Ludicrously slow processor.

459
00:29:53,655 --> 00:29:57,807
Scott: five megahertz is playing a video of a dude breakdancing.

460
00:29:57,827 --> 00:29:59,010
Scott: It's pretty fantastic.

461
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:09,290
Scott: So imagine if someone you know the games you're playing now you play Bioshock or whatever, you know Supreme Commander you look at those system requirements, right and they're ludicrous.

462
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:13,469
Scott: It's like you need ludicrous stuff to play even get this game to play Barely at all.

463
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:13,829
Scott: right.

464
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:28,250
Scott: If that game was actually Optimized and some people actually took a year to the reason they can't optimize it because the game is so complex that to optimize it Yeah, you realize that I don't think Object orientation is gonna be happening so much.

465
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:29,213
Scott: We have.

466
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:40,910
Scott: the way people program things now is we make it a lot easier for the programmers to program them And that is what allows us to actually create complex programs without having to think really hard.

467
00:30:42,094 --> 00:30:52,730
Rym: It gets to the point where the amount of time it would take or the effort or they just what you would have to Do to make low-level things do these high-level things is almost and probably is now beyond what humans can do.

468
00:30:52,790 --> 00:31:06,937
Scott: Yeah, but I mean if you spent like a few years we're talking years and years of actually trying to make say Half-life right and optimize it fully, you know on the for pro that for the programmers It'd be the hardest work probably you can imagine.

469
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:15,024
Scott: but the result you could probably get like something is good As counter-strike to work at like a hundred FPS on a 386.

470
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:16,690
Scott: It's probably possible.

471
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:20,410
Scott: It's just ludicrously difficult to optimize that program to that level.

472
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:25,669
Scott: but here's a demonstration to show you that that sort of thing is indeed possible.

473
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:35,680
Scott: and basically, you have to spend a whole lot of money on lots of crazy hardware in your computer because Programmers are lazy and not as smart and not that smart.

474
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,854
Scott: And in fact, no one is that smart not a single person No one can do it.

475
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:41,885
Scott: It's that hard, but it could be done.

476
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:48,316
Rym: So a long time ago in the in the year of 1979 a great year for the world.

477
00:31:48,938 --> 00:31:50,041
Scott: I was not alive yet.

478
00:31:50,703 --> 00:32:08,590
Rym: Neither was I. I was z- negative 3 but in that door There was a company named Avalon Hill and this company put forth a game a game called Dune based on the science fiction books by Frank Herbert.

479
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:13,330
Scott: Yes, Frank Herbert's Dune the books that I tried to read once and did not like but that was a long time ago.

480
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,837
Rym: You only tried to read the first one.

481
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:16,727
Scott: I tried to read the first one in like middle school.

482
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:17,350
Scott: They didn't like it.

483
00:32:17,753 --> 00:32:19,043
Scott: I don't remember anything of it.

484
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:19,970
Scott: That's all I'm gonna say.

485
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:36,189
Rym: Well, I remember way back when we were Scott and I were living up here before, you know more people moved into the geek houses sphere of influence and we were so bored and crazy and just wanted to play games that we went to this local gaming club a. As a result, we met two really cool people from a local college who?

486
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:40,000
Rym: Like they took us over and they played board games with us.

487
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,482
Rym: We played.

488
00:32:40,702 --> 00:32:41,465
Rym: uh, what do we play?

489
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:42,930
Rym: played Starfarers of Catan?

490
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:46,582
Scott: No, I like the mechanic of Starfarers and Catan with the question thing.

491
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:48,670
Rym: Yeah, the problem is once you know the answers.

492
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:54,630
Rym: Yeah, if anyone to memorize the answers has an advantage, but I think anyone who doesn't memorize the answers is stupid.

493
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,789
Rym: Yep, and we played other games with them.

494
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,950
Rym: But I remember one time we were at one of their apartments and we're gonna play a game.

495
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:15,510
Rym: We're gonna play that King Arthur game and then suddenly we start talking about this Dune game and he brings down He shows it to us and he's like, yeah, this game is super old and super out of print But it's super awesome and he explains it to us.

496
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:19,150
Scott: And basically the way he explains us the game is he doesn't actually tell us how the game works.

497
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:25,889
Scott: He's just goes through the six different races that you're allowed to be and he tells us what their superpowers are.

498
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:28,264
Scott: now You know you play a game like Starcraft.

499
00:33:28,305 --> 00:33:29,090
Scott: It's like the Zerg.

500
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:37,870
Scott: They can make a lot of guys in rush Oh, man, the protoss they can make a few guys that are really powerful but expensive like oh man, right?

501
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,630
Scott: Well in Dune, do you want to go through the list right now?

502
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,070
Scott: We can do it that you can give people the same experience that we got.

503
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:48,974
Rym: I think we should because I remember we were talking about asymmetric games that are good and how rare they are And he was like.

504
00:33:49,015 --> 00:33:51,090
Rym: Dune is probably the best asymmetric game ever.

505
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,036
Scott: What do we mean by an asymmetric game?

506
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:57,010
Scott: right is a symmetric game is a game where every player is the same a monopoly.

507
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:00,443
Scott: Everyone gets the same everyone has the same starting money.

508
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:02,170
Scott: Everyone starts in the same position.

509
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:05,309
Scott: It's pretty much everyone is equal in the game.

510
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:06,839
Rym: It's more like an asymmetric game.

511
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,539
Rym: would be like say you play chess But one side gets four Knights and the other side gets four bishops.

512
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:17,900
Scott: Yep, that not everyone is the same, you know be like Starcraft protoss for a Zerg you don't?

513
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,206
Scott: you're not doing the exact same.

514
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:26,779
Rym: or like a Fortress America where there's three players with one common goal and then one player plays a completely different Players America.

515
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,290
Scott: and but that's more of a versus game.

516
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:32,606
Scott: But it's still a symmetric one person's America and plays by these rules as opposed to a non versus game.

517
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:36,556
Scott: Yep, such as Co-op game like Arkham horror.

518
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:38,262
Rym: I think most games are versus games.

519
00:34:38,382 --> 00:34:39,928
Scott: I know I'm just saying saying what.

520
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:44,303
Rym: okay So the way he described this game is you basically just told us the powers of all the factions.

521
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:50,550
Rym: So the Harkonnen See in this game the one the best thing about it is that you look at the board.

522
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:53,868
Rym: It's so epitomizes the world of Frank Herbert's dude.

523
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:54,150
Rym: Yeah

524
00:34:54,271 --> 00:35:11,476
Scott: I don't really know anything about Frank Herbert's dune But I can tell from look playing this game and looking at this game from what other people's reactions to this game That all the rules of this game Mirror the world of dune so flawlessly Like if you like dune.

525
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:17,830
Scott: this game is dune in the same way that the Mario Super Show Actually mirrors the Mario game.

526
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:27,690
Rym: I mean the first time we played it With a full group of people The way the factions kind of ended up allied with each other was very much like what happens in the books.

527
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:32,930
Rym: Yeah, but anyway, so the Harkonnen they oh, yeah, I forgot what I was gonna say here.

528
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,694
Rym: I gotta get back to that.

529
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:34,799
Rym: You look at the board.

530
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:40,279
Rym: There's two piles of cards spice and Treachery and that's pretty much it.

531
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:42,067
Rym: That's the whole game spice and treachery.

532
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:54,959
Rym: Yep so the Harkonnen start with two treachery cards instead of one and Every time they buy one they get another one free and they can hold twice as many in their hand as any other player.

533
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:56,829
Rym: and There's traders.

534
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:11,720
Rym: you see everyone has these like generals these leaders that whenever you're in a battle you have to send one of them to lead the battle and before you play the game everyone shuffles up all their leaders and everyone picks for and draws them and you look at them and you pick one of your enemy leaders and decide that they are in your pay.

535
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:21,082
Rym: and Any time you're in a battle involving them you can if you wish but you don't have to Call out treachery and automatically win the battle and kill their other.

536
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:23,810
Rym: all this business happens and you win and it's super fun and awesome.

537
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:24,267
Rym: It's good.

538
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:31,030
Rym: So, uh the Harkonnen they get as traders every single person that they see in that stage of the game.

539
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,218
Scott: So everyone else has at most one trader.

540
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,550
Scott: the Harkonnen could have as many as four people under their pay.

541
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:38,174
Rym: Everybody was gaga.

542
00:36:38,455 --> 00:36:40,280
Scott: So think about that power, right?

543
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:44,010
Scott: That's an insanely strong power almost cheating.

544
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:56,585
Scott: You don't even know how the game works, but you can tell twice as many treachery cards as everyone else Being able to hold more of them and get free ones Having four times as many traders in your pay as anyone else.

545
00:36:56,986 --> 00:37:07,120
Scott: That's ludicrous and that is why this game is amazing is because everyone plays by as different powers that let them break the rules and Everyone's power is ludicrous.

546
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,290
Scott: Every single player's power is ludicrous.

547
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:19,110
Rym: So the guild right now in this game when you want to ship troops from your reserves onto the board You have to pay to ship them there and it costs more or less depending on where you ship them.

548
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:21,237
Rym: You don't pay the bank.

549
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:23,625
Rym: You don't pay some sort of abstract bullshit.

550
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:24,769
Scott: Well, you do usually.

551
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:29,245
Rym: no Well, if you're shipping troops you pay the guild.

552
00:37:29,526 --> 00:37:30,410
Rym: the guild is a player.

553
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:34,690
Rym: So if Scott's the guild and I want to ship people onto the board I pay Scott.

554
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,770
Rym: Yep, everyone pays Scott.

555
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:43,835
Scott: keep in mind that most players start with the mass majority of their people not on the board and they have to pay to Ship them on.

556
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:48,945
Rym: and also when people die and go to the tanks You have to buy them back and then you have to ship them back again.

557
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:53,600
Rym: Oh Yeah, the guild also unfair that is also.

558
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:57,390
Rym: they can take their turn at any point during the turn if they want.

559
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:58,457
Scott: I thought that was an optional.

560
00:37:58,538 --> 00:38:00,230
Rym: it is but most people play with all those rules.

561
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:06,087
Rym: Okay, and if no one wins the game at the F after 15 turns they win by default.

562
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,490
Scott: Oh My god, think about how crazy that is, but the Harkonnen was equally crazy.

563
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:12,740
Rym: So the Fremen?

564
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,953
Rym: now this is with the optional rules But everyone plays with those.

565
00:38:15,555 --> 00:38:19,046
Rym: in addition to their normal troops three of their troops are elite.

566
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:29,855
Rym: They move faster They're not destroyed by other business on the board and they're mostly immune to the storm and they can predict where the storms going And that sort of thing

567
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:30,597
Scott: great

568
00:38:30,718 --> 00:38:35,454
Rym: if no one's won at the end of the game and certain conditions But you're not that hard to make.

569
00:38:35,494 --> 00:38:36,699
Rym: come to pass come to pass.

570
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,509
Scott: They just win and if they don't win then the guild wins.

571
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:46,624
Rym: and They like if the worm comes up they can ride the worm somewhere and they don't have to pay to ship their guys onto the board.

572
00:38:48,751 --> 00:38:49,978
Scott: Ultimate enemies of the guild.

573
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:59,597
Rym: so the Emperor has five of these elite units that he can deal with and you know those treachery cards you bid on him every round and Oftentimes you pay a lot for those treachery cards.

574
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,088
Rym: You don't pay the bank you pay the Emperor.

575
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:06,838
Scott: Ah People are buying treachery cards all the time.

576
00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:10,310
Rym: Yeah, you pretty much have infinite money throughout the entire game if you're the Emperor.

577
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:17,490
Rym: So the old ladies the Bene Gesserit they can see anytime two factions are on a space on the board.

578
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:19,017
Rym: They have to fight to the death.

579
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,305
Rym: the Bene Gesserit can if they choose Coexist with other people's units and not cause a fight.

580
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:32,190
Rym: also Whenever they're fighting they can tell you what card they want you or do not want you to play during the combat.

581
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,712
Rym: You know what?

582
00:39:33,213 --> 00:39:34,517
Rym: You have to do what they say.

583
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,764
Scott: Yeah, you're fighting me right now.

584
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:38,510
Scott: Yeah, don't use any weapons in this fight?

585
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,335
Scott: No, seriously, you can't use any weapons.

586
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:49,470
Rym: because I said so cuz I'm an old lady and if anyone ships anyone to the board They get to take one unit and put it in the middle of the board for free every time.

587
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:55,297
Scott: So like if you know It doesn't matter who ships if if I put five guys on the board the old ladies put one guy in the middle.

588
00:39:55,578 --> 00:40:02,579
Scott: if Rym puts three guys on the board the old ladies put one guy in the middle and After all the factions are picked and before the game starts the Bene?

589
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,187
Rym: Gesserit secretly determine one player and one turn.

590
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:11,261
Rym: if that Player or an alliance including that player wins on that turn.

591
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,106
Rym: They don't win the Bene?

592
00:40:13,146 --> 00:40:14,310
Rym: Gesserit win instead.

593
00:40:15,172 --> 00:40:23,001
Scott: Ah, so if let's say the the old ladies say they secretly they write down Scott's gonna win On turn three and Scott wins on turn three.

594
00:40:23,443 --> 00:40:24,850
Scott: Scott doesn't really win on turn three.

595
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,094
Scott: The old ladies win on turn three.

596
00:40:26,114 --> 00:40:31,390
Scott: So a viable strategy for the old ladies is help someone else win on the turn that you predict.

597
00:40:31,993 --> 00:40:33,802
Rym: Yeah, there are a lot of fun ways to do that too.

598
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:34,384
Rym: Now.

599
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,389
Rym: How's the tradies?

600
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:42,269
Rym: They when you know when you bid on treachery cards, you don't get to see what they are You bring it's not like a treatise and then you bid on them.

601
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:47,029
Rym: So, uh, they get to look at every card before it gets bid on.

602
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:52,805
Rym: Now now now there's another fun rule in this game that makes this power so much more interesting.

603
00:40:52,865 --> 00:41:01,226
Rym: you see and this is what really Sold me on the game, you know most games like Shogun or risk or whatever You can make deals with people but there's no kind of in-game mechanic for it.

604
00:41:01,286 --> 00:41:04,590
Rym: It's just alright I'll ally with you, but there's nothing to enforce it.

605
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:12,030
Rym: You can just break them all the time and the alliances really never play a big part in the game because you can't trust anyone As Pete learned so famously the first two times we played Shogun

606
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:12,772
Scott: Yep,

607
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:21,323
Rym: but there's other games like settlers where you can trade very specific things in the game with very specific set of rules And it's very much like guided by the game.

608
00:41:21,343 --> 00:41:22,570
Rym: Mm-hmm in Dune.

609
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:32,718
Rym: You can trade without as long as you do not violate the rules of the game and do not trade leaders or treachery cards Or powers those the only things you can't trade.

610
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,510
Rym: you can make any deal you want with anyone.

611
00:41:36,892 --> 00:41:40,890
Rym: And the thing is you can make deals secretly, but then they're not part of this rule.

612
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,961
Rym: They're just part of a normal game.

613
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:42,850
Rym: You can do it or not do it.

614
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:43,694
Rym: No one has to follow through.

615
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:47,379
Rym: if you decide to make a real deal like say Scott and I agree All

616
00:41:47,401 --> 00:41:54,399
Scott: right When you're bargaining like when you're bargaining like I can bargain with Rym off to the side Quietly, I can just beg whisper whisper whisper whispers, right

617
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:57,510
Rym: and we could even make a deal quietly, but it's not bound by these rules

618
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:02,530
Scott: Right, so we make a deal quietly then I if I break that deal, whatever it doesn't matter.

619
00:42:02,611 --> 00:42:05,069
Scott: It was we were just talking quietly that it doesn't mean anything.

620
00:42:05,552 --> 00:42:26,589
Rym: But if we decide alright, let's do this we can come back out and say alright If Scott attacks Scott Johnson next round with 17 men blah and blah and blah and then we and we ally on And we agree not to break our alliance up on the next Nexus then I will give him 25 spice right now.

621
00:42:27,271 --> 00:42:28,956
Rym: Mmm now I give him the 25 spice.

622
00:42:29,398 --> 00:42:31,725
Rym: It's not like there's a penalty if he doesn't follow through.

623
00:42:31,745 --> 00:42:32,488
Rym: he must.

624
00:42:33,892 --> 00:42:34,595
Scott: It's the rule.

625
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:41,617
Scott: if you make a deal out in the open and you shake on it and it's it's a it's a locked in Deal, it is now the rules of the game.

626
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:43,302
Scott: You must do it.

627
00:42:43,903 --> 00:42:46,350
Rym: You must so with the house.

628
00:42:46,871 --> 00:42:48,075
Rym: I can see all the cards.

629
00:42:48,456 --> 00:43:00,590
Rym: I could say sell people the privilege of knowing what the card is before the bidding or say I'm fighting it real hard with the Harkonnen next to me and The Harkonnen just bought a bunch of cards.

630
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:08,635
Rym: I could be like I'll pay you five spice if you tell me and no one else what cards he just got Or anything like that.

631
00:43:08,675 --> 00:43:09,738
Rym: you can do all sorts of stuff.

632
00:43:10,098 --> 00:43:14,109
Rym: you also get to see ahead of time where the spice is going to be.

633
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:16,315
Rym: Now think about that.

634
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:23,184
Rym: every faction in this game has a crazy fucking power And if you look at any one you think well, they're gonna win no matter what but everyone.

635
00:43:23,765 --> 00:43:27,598
Rym: you say that about everyone And I think that is what makes this game great.

636
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:29,544
Scott: Yes, like hey, there are six races.

637
00:43:29,705 --> 00:43:30,086
Scott: Okay.

638
00:43:30,488 --> 00:43:31,250
Scott: Each one is different.

639
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,759
Scott: Okay, this one can basically cheat.

640
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:35,124
Scott: how do they lose?

641
00:43:35,345 --> 00:43:36,670
Scott: well that one can cheat too.

642
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:43,002
Scott: In fact, they can all cheat just in a different way And I think that's one of the things that makes this game really fun.

643
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:45,714
Scott: is you know whenever you play any sort of game Right.

644
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:48,870
Scott: The game is all about restrictions and if you learn anything from counter-strike.

645
00:43:49,291 --> 00:44:02,748
Scott: Sometimes breaking the rules in a game can be fun because if you play a game and you have to obey all the rules and The rules are really, you know Constrictive and and restrictive and they don't let you do everything you want to do then it can be unfun.

646
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:10,668
Scott: and occasionally You know if someone gives you the ability to break those rules even once it's like yes Yes, I can break those rules god damn it.

647
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:15,990
Scott: Yes I'm gonna kick ass now and everyone gets to kick ass in a different way all the time.

648
00:44:16,092 --> 00:44:21,750
Scott: So it's like yes I'm kicking ass and everyone's kicking ass all the time and everyone kicks each other's asses all the time.

649
00:44:22,297 --> 00:44:32,847
Rym: now the other thing I Didn't mention yet because I think I said something about oh well Alliance this game handles alliances in perhaps the most awesome way any game ever has.

650
00:44:32,867 --> 00:44:45,990
Rym: you see whenever a worm comes up from the spice deck a nexus occurs and basically the game stops until All the alliances are settled and any number of players can form an alliance and you can only be in one Alliance.

651
00:44:46,071 --> 00:44:52,950
Rym: You don't have to be an alliance You can break them whatever you want But until the Nexus ends everyone can form alliances as they please with whatever conditions they want.

652
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:59,463
Rym: yep, and if I see to win the game there are what five strongholds on do on Arrakis.

653
00:45:00,145 --> 00:45:13,777
Rym: if any one player or any alliance of players has at least one token on Three or more of these fortresses at the end of a turn at the end of any turn The game is immediately over and they win.

654
00:45:14,198 --> 00:45:14,359
Rym: Yep.

655
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,510
Rym: So let's say I have two fortresses and Scott has two fortresses.

656
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:18,695
Rym: Everyone else has buckets.

657
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:20,542
Rym: Maybe the Fremen have like one fortune.

658
00:45:20,563 --> 00:45:22,330
Rym: the worm shows up the worm shows up.

659
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,105
Scott: We just decide that we're gonna win and we do so.

660
00:45:25,185 --> 00:45:27,274
Rym: Scott and I say all right We ally great.

661
00:45:27,716 --> 00:45:31,388
Rym: if we still have at least three fortresses at the end of that turn we win.

662
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:35,942
Scott: Yep, unless the old ladies predicted that one of us would win on that turn.

663
00:45:36,183 --> 00:45:36,524
Rym: Yes.

664
00:45:37,105 --> 00:45:46,477
Rym: Now this rule I Mean, I wondered how it would work out But the first time we played it with a full group of people the worm came up like right away And I was the Harkonnen.

665
00:45:46,517 --> 00:45:52,283
Rym: so I had a fortress already and I had a bunch of guys already on the board and I look around look at Alex.

666
00:45:52,303 --> 00:46:05,249
Rym: It's like alright we both have a ton of money and a ton of guys and two fortresses between us want to just fucking win and We look around and yeah, we allied then we won and there's pretty much nothing anyone could have done about it.

667
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:08,479
Rym: Nope, and the thing is theoretical.

668
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:13,698
Rym: you could make an alliance of five players and just fuck Whoever was the sixth player and win.

669
00:46:13,718 --> 00:46:16,130
Rym: Yeah, and that seems really out of the spirit of the game.

670
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,389
Scott: But at the same time I have no problem with it.

671
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:24,048
Rym: I have no problem because I don't feel like that'll happen a lot because think about this This is the game is much like it.

672
00:46:24,371 --> 00:46:26,620
Rym: It seduces you much like the power of spice.

673
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,910
Rym: and why dune was the way it was in the story.

674
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:40,069
Rym: Alright, I could just be nice and share my victory with all of you But what if I act like I'm gonna be all nice and then when the next Nexus comes up before the game's over I fuck everybody and win on my own?

675
00:46:40,451 --> 00:46:43,684
Rym: that's so much more awesome than sharing my victory with these posers.

676
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,009
Rym: or what if?

677
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:50,810
Rym: Why should I ally with four of you when I can just ally with Scott and then our victory is so much more meaningful?

678
00:46:51,095 --> 00:46:51,686
Rym: You suckers.

679
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:53,614
Scott: Yeah, you want it.

680
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:57,908
Scott: basically, you know, if you are actually someone who cares about winning which you should be.

681
00:46:57,928 --> 00:47:05,370
Scott: if you're playing a game Otherwise you're playing it wrong then you're gonna sort of naturally want to win with as few people as possible.

682
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,942
Scott: Why would you you know, I mean you could technically always win like worm.

683
00:47:09,142 --> 00:47:11,109
Scott: everyone allies game over, but that's lame.

684
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:17,990
Scott: You want to do something awesome and the motivation you have and playing the game is gonna cause the game to always be awesome.

685
00:47:18,513 --> 00:47:33,810
Rym: And I remember when the first Nexus came up It's like pretty much everyone formed these gigantic alliances right away And then everyone kind of sat there for a minute and then pretty much all the alliances Collapsed as everyone started arguing and fighting and for like 20 minutes we argued about it and it was great.

686
00:47:34,174 --> 00:47:45,030
Rym: Yep, people like well I'll agree to do this and I'll smash this and I don't know that and that that alone made this game worth the price of Purchase that that moment when that first worm came up was so great.

687
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:55,089
Scott: I think this game is most similar to diplomacy and that you know There's some rules of stuff that goes on in the board and you sort of have to master and understand those things or else you're Gonna be a really weak position.

688
00:47:55,592 --> 00:47:59,465
Scott: But as soon as you master those things, right and it's not too hard to master them.

689
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:00,650
Scott: Just play the game a few times.

690
00:48:01,071 --> 00:48:18,770
Scott: Eventually the game becomes all the wheeling and dealing is the stuff that really matters and all the other stuff is sort of a given because it's unlike a lot of other games like you play a game like I don't know Vinci right and Who wins and who loses pretty much comes down to the final turn, you know, it's like it's a close race.

691
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,077
Scott: It's a close race to close races.

692
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:20,821
Scott: the final turn.

693
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:22,650
Scott: who got the most points of the final turn?

694
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:23,554
Scott: It was Scott.

695
00:48:23,594 --> 00:48:25,201
Scott: Yeah in this game.

696
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:29,318
Scott: There are five spaces on the board You need three to win.

697
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,109
Rym: a lot of people start with one already.

698
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,800
Scott: Yeah, so it's not too hard to get three.

699
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:39,350
Scott: pretty much every turn is like the last turn.

700
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,734
Scott: someone can win at any moment.

701
00:48:42,154 --> 00:48:52,410
Scott: so every turn you play it like it's the last turn and You're pretty much on the edge of your seat fighting for the game every single turn and that is crazy.

702
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:52,993
Scott: Awesome.

703
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:55,062
Scott: that like every single turn could be the last turn.

704
00:48:55,444 --> 00:49:07,358
Rym: now a guy Whose name is a gnarly thotep Aha, you know gnarly GN Adam Prince, okay on board game key Posted a review.

705
00:49:07,419 --> 00:49:18,250
Scott: that I think sums up everything I want to say about yeah I know I saw this review there when I was doing the pre show Research like five minutes ago ten minutes ago and um, this guy doesn't target for a half hour.

706
00:49:18,391 --> 00:49:18,934
Rym: It was well.

707
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,270
Scott: his review is so much better than our review.

708
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:24,107
Scott: I feel like our show is worthless in the in the face of his review.

709
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:30,459
Rym: now Basically, I'm going to read the first few paragraphs of his review brief And I think this will tell you more so than anything.

710
00:49:30,479 --> 00:49:32,405
Rym: we have said what makes doing great.

711
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:46,052
Rym: and if you ever played diplomacy You'll know this feeling because Dune if nothing else is the kind of game Where if you're not close friends with someone or you have trouble not taking things personally you will lose Friendships.

712
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:50,746
Rym: if you play this game much like if you play diplomacy, maybe all right.

713
00:49:51,207 --> 00:49:52,270
Rym: There are a few reviews out there.

714
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,114
Rym: I'll skip that paragraph.

715
00:49:53,555 --> 00:50:01,709
Rym: Dune gives you and the other players the absolute Unrestricted and utterly unbeatable chance to be a jerk.

716
00:50:02,258 --> 00:50:02,727
Rym: That's right.

717
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:06,422
Rym: Dune allows you to be a huge jerk and all in the name of fun.

718
00:50:06,843 --> 00:50:08,710
Rym: and really what's more fun than being a jerk?

719
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:14,795
Rym: Nothing being a jerk to plenty of people at once jackpot This game.

720
00:50:15,337 --> 00:50:23,110
Rym: let me tell you right away like in the first game I was like I went over to Scott Johnson kind on the slime like alright We're next to each other and we both have ornithopters.

721
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:26,945
Rym: Let's just agree to Ally and then win as soon as we can.

722
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:28,010
Rym: and that didn't happen.

723
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:36,006
Rym: I totally stabbed him in the back immediately, but at the same time So many of the things I did in this game were such asshole moves.

724
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:42,690
Rym: like alright It doesn't really cost me much to send some guys over there to attack so-and-so, but you know what I got spice to kill.

725
00:50:43,353 --> 00:50:46,650
Rym: I'm just gonna ruin their chances of winning this round just because it doesn't cost me much.

726
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:50,352
Scott: Yeah, I would basically like I when I was the Emperor I didn't have.

727
00:50:50,493 --> 00:50:56,009
Scott: it's hard for the Emperor to actually fight because his guys all start off the board So he takes him a while to get all those guys on the board.

728
00:50:56,552 --> 00:51:01,130
Scott: So just I would basically send guys out to their deaths in stupid battles.

729
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:06,464
Scott: They couldn't win just to make sure the game didn't end and I just basically suicide people.

730
00:51:06,805 --> 00:51:08,550
Rym: Oh also the way combat works.

731
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,978
Rym: I'll basically I'm gonna roll this down real.

732
00:51:11,018 --> 00:51:18,190
Rym: simply the mechanic you need to care about is that you both have a battle wheel with Numbers from 0 to 20 and you can only have 20 guys in space.

733
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:26,310
Rym: So that works out when you guys yeah, so when you fight with someone basically you play cards whatever behind your shield and a leader.

734
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:32,710
Rym: But most importantly you each dial a number from 0 up to the number of guys you have there.

735
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:37,367
Scott: So if I have 10 guys in the space fighting I can put the wheel on any number from 0 to 10.

736
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:44,910
Rym: now Then you compare numbers, which is basically the number you dialed plus the battle value of your leader plus any other effects.

737
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:45,552
Rym: But there aren't many.

738
00:51:45,993 --> 00:51:47,897
Rym: whoever has the highest number wins now.

739
00:51:48,158 --> 00:51:53,050
Rym: whoever had whoever lost all their guys die and they lose the space.

740
00:51:53,732 --> 00:51:59,110
Rym: But the person who wins loses no matter what a number of guys equal to what they dial.

741
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:03,648
Scott: So if I have 10 guys and I dial the number 5 if I win I lose 5 guys.

742
00:52:04,795 --> 00:52:06,370
Scott: If I lose I lose all 10 guys.

743
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:11,950
Scott: So I can dial 10 which should give me a much better chance of winning because I have a such a big number.

744
00:52:12,391 --> 00:52:17,630
Scott: But if I win I lose all the guys and it basically it's a kamikaze attack, it's so great.

745
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,382
Scott: It's great, but continue reading that review there.

746
00:52:20,482 --> 00:52:25,840
Rym: All right pros of the dune game Allows you to act like a complete jerk for an entire session.

747
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,307
Rym: All right Khan opponents tend to be jerks.

748
00:52:28,587 --> 00:52:33,310
Rym: Yeah Bro, a flavorful atmospheric game with enjoyable tense gameplay.

749
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:34,694
Rym: I think tense is right on.

750
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,864
Rym: Khan may take a bit too long to play.

751
00:52:37,884 --> 00:52:38,566
Rym: for some people.

752
00:52:38,988 --> 00:52:41,716
Scott: doesn't take that long Actually is surprisingly not long.

753
00:52:41,736 --> 00:52:43,822
Rym: Well, no the first game we played didn't take long.

754
00:52:43,883 --> 00:52:46,290
Rym: the second game we played went on forever.

755
00:52:47,296 --> 00:52:48,972
Rym: Okay Pro.

756
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,830
Rym: it's based on a well-loved book series Khan.

757
00:52:52,231 --> 00:52:57,670
Rym: Extremely hard to locate and purchase without spending enough money to put someone's kid through a four-year college program.

758
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,997
Scott: Yeah, this game was made in 1979.

759
00:52:59,997 --> 00:53:01,482
Scott: It is out of print.

760
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:01,884
Scott: There's.

761
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:03,850
Scott: there was a new copy on eBay.

762
00:53:04,011 --> 00:53:05,040
Scott: I bid 80 bucks on.

763
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,229
Scott: it went for a hundred something.

764
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:14,330
Scott: Eventually, there was a used copy on eBay and with good timing I was able to get it for $40 and it's luckily an almost perfect condition.

765
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:15,694
Scott: So that was lucky.

766
00:53:15,795 --> 00:53:18,182
Scott: but this is a very hard game to get.

767
00:53:18,243 --> 00:53:24,729
Rym: Yeah, and don't get me started on the expansions You're not gonna find those no, but this game is almost impossible to buy isn't it?

768
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:28,870
Scott: Great that we're reviewing it so glowingly making you want to play a game that you can't get.

769
00:53:29,151 --> 00:53:33,150
Rym: Yeah, luckily the rules are well known and on the internet and there's a con here.

770
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,810
Rym: This is probably the most important con of the game.

771
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:44,457
Rym: This may lead you to the urge to carve lacquer paint acid sketch inscribed program virtually tattoo or otherwise overdue Your own personal copy of the game.

772
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:48,850
Scott: a lot of people out there have made their own copies of Dune.

773
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:56,260
Scott: They get the rule book and they look at pictures on the internet and whatnot and they they make Their own copy of the game because you can't buy a copy of the game.

774
00:53:56,882 --> 00:54:05,207
Rym: now luckily there is a computer Simulation version of this game that from what I gather is all like 99% perfect.

775
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,221
Rym: That's good, and I'm gonna link to it.

776
00:54:09,722 --> 00:54:11,830
Rym: I highly recommend you get some friends together.

777
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:13,430
Rym: Don't play this over the internet with idiots.

778
00:54:14,077 --> 00:54:15,270
Rym: Get a bunch of computers hot.

779
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,801
Rym: However, you need to do it and play it with all of you in the same room.

780
00:54:19,262 --> 00:54:26,624
Rym: This game is so fun If you are willing to deal with the fact that this game is incredibly hardcore.

781
00:54:26,985 --> 00:54:28,550
Scott: Yeah, it's a super hardcore game.

782
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:32,584
Scott: This is a nerd game from 1979 before there were internets.

783
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,270
Scott: before there are really nerds and geeks.

784
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:39,103
Scott: So this is when you had to program a computer with like basic if that right.

785
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:41,510
Scott: so everything was hard for geeks back then.

786
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:43,441
Scott: So this game is included in.

787
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:44,970
Scott: that is a hard game.

788
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:48,830
Scott: It is not easy, but it is a good game, and it is awesome.

789
00:54:49,332 --> 00:54:52,749
Rym: And if you're ever at a con, I think I want to run this game at a convention.

790
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:55,087
Rym: whoa I think we should run into ConnectiCon.

791
00:54:55,107 --> 00:55:02,330
Rym: Oh Unless they say no and I doubt they will because ConnectiCon is like my favorite little con We'll have to have people sign up for it though.

792
00:55:02,611 --> 00:55:10,802
Rym: Oh, yes, but low quality like walk-ins play the rare out of print game Yeah, but I'm so about this game being run at cons by me mmm.

793
00:55:11,423 --> 00:55:21,316
Rym: Good God all right, but anyway seriously If you if you have money Buy this game you can get it on eBay for a hundred something dollars or less Maybe.

794
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:22,910
Scott: yeah, you got to try really hard.

795
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:23,934
Scott: I got it for 40.

796
00:55:23,934 --> 00:55:27,410
Rym: so try it on the with that program first to make sure you like it.

797
00:55:27,511 --> 00:55:28,298
Rym: I think you'll like it.

798
00:55:28,884 --> 00:55:33,066
Rym: or just you know Hang out with a bunch of friends for a weekend in college and make your own set.

799
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:33,870
Rym: It's not that hard.

800
00:55:34,191 --> 00:55:37,349
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's a map which is a circle with some lines on it.

801
00:55:38,012 --> 00:55:40,606
Scott: It's a. you can even just print out a picture on the web.

802
00:55:40,988 --> 00:55:44,605
Scott: you need 20 token 20 colored tokens of six colors.

803
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:45,530
Scott: you can buy those at the craft.

804
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:46,493
Rym: This is my favorite one.

805
00:55:46,514 --> 00:55:48,260
Rym: someone made like this wood lacquered one.

806
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,408
Rym: It looks so hot is it?

807
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:51,973
Scott: yes They won't sell it to you.

808
00:55:52,595 --> 00:55:55,044
Rym: We could make this yeah, but by make it.

809
00:55:55,124 --> 00:55:56,810
Rym: I mean pay someone to make it.

810
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:05,270
Rym: Actually, this is we should do another show on this because the only board game anyone should ever make for themselves is crocodile Tigers and Euphrates.

811
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:09,070
Rym: Maybe see the thing is looking at these pictures is inspiring me again.

812
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:12,384
Rym: So I've had this idea for a long time that I play board games a lot like.

813
00:56:12,424 --> 00:56:16,500
Rym: board games are a huge part of my life and I feel like nothing would be like.

814
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:26,402
Rym: you know you when you go to like a ping-pong competition right or A pool like you go to a pool hall and there's always that one guy Who brings his own pool cue or brings his own ping-pong paddle.

815
00:56:26,663 --> 00:56:27,505
Rym: go to the bowling alley.

816
00:56:27,525 --> 00:56:28,830
Rym: the guy with his own bowling ball as?

817
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,418
Rym: Opposed to you or rented an alley ball for a dollar.

818
00:56:31,499 --> 00:56:33,907
Rym: your alley shoes alley shoes alley ball.

819
00:56:34,168 --> 00:56:34,850
Scott: go play golf.

820
00:56:34,951 --> 00:56:36,109
Scott: He's got his own clubs.

821
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,053
Scott: He didn't rent any.

822
00:56:37,234 --> 00:56:41,570
Rym: you know his own golf cart when I was a kid when I was actually going golf ball mini golf.

823
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:43,702
Rym: I would bring my own Potter to the mini golf.

824
00:56:43,963 --> 00:56:45,210
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

825
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,823
Rym: I'm not good at mini golf anymore cuz I don't play it that much granted.

826
00:56:47,944 --> 00:56:49,190
Scott: Who's the best at mini golf Scott?

827
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,413
Scott: That's right, though.

828
00:56:50,434 --> 00:56:53,526
Rym: I gotta say it's got kind of close at the last Wildwood.

829
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:54,690
Rym: It got real close.

830
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:56,158
Scott: I think I lost to somebody.

831
00:56:56,178 --> 00:56:57,344
Rym: you did you lost to me.

832
00:56:57,364 --> 00:56:58,430
Rym: I want someone else.

833
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:01,030
Scott: I win most of the time he does but I never do poorly.

834
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:05,570
Rym: Well, you didn't do poorly but to a couple of people did better than you last time.

835
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,201
Scott: Yeah, by like a few strokes, but it no it came down.

836
00:57:08,281 --> 00:57:10,470
Rym: I remember cuz last time we played mini golf.

837
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:12,016
Rym: Oh, we got a do show mini golf.

838
00:57:12,578 --> 00:57:15,470
Rym: I was down by a lot like the first the first nine.

839
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:18,202
Rym: I was sucking I sixed out like three times.

840
00:57:18,343 --> 00:57:21,898
Rym: Uh-huh, but then in the second half It was nothing but twos and I caught up.

841
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:27,160
Rym: Yeah, but this game that we're not talking about mini golf Even though Arrakis is kind of a sand trap.

842
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:36,810
Rym: Yeah sand trap for your soul Okay, but uh, yeah, I had this idea that perhaps I should make my own set of gaming accoutrement.

843
00:57:37,213 --> 00:57:38,159
Scott: Well, I mean RPG.

844
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:38,924
Scott: people already have this.

845
00:57:38,944 --> 00:57:43,210
Scott: they have their own dice They have their own pencils and their own clipboards for their own character.

846
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:50,835
Rym: I'm thinking like if I had a set of four tokens like silver edge like cheap silver like sterling silver With felt on the bottom.

847
00:57:50,855 --> 00:57:58,785
Rym: like these are my leaders for T&E and like I make stuff for all the games that I care about A lot I make stuff for those games my own set.

848
00:57:58,966 --> 00:58:07,891
Rym: These are my pawns That I will use when I play chess Yep, and for like every other game just make a set of generic tokens and pawns and things that are all kind of themed to Me.

849
00:58:08,072 --> 00:58:09,096
Scott: yeah, these are my stones.

850
00:58:09,116 --> 00:58:20,757
Scott: So when I play go and I think though, you know because board games It's sort of like unlike other games, you know individual sports like, you know golf or bowling where each you know Each person has their own individual equipment.

851
00:58:21,118 --> 00:58:25,314
Scott: a board game is sort of like the shared piece of equipment where everyone Manipulates the same thing.

852
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:41,670
Scott: So I think it's really much better to just make a custom set of the game that's what most people do rather than have your own stuff and you put your fancy silver tokens on the plain T&E board or You just make a fancy T&E set with like, you know, the fancy board and the fancy pieces and the fancy tip.

853
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:43,395
Rym: yeah, but the thing is I always look forward.

854
00:58:43,435 --> 00:58:52,290
Rym: cuz Scott and I we play games at conventions a lot and we pretty much always Win partly because we're obsessive about games and we play like playing T&E at a convention.

855
00:58:52,773 --> 00:59:01,576
Rym: I've played T&E so many times in my life Yep, but imagine going to a gaming con like you're like, oh man I'm gonna play Settlers of Catan.

856
00:59:01,857 --> 00:59:08,922
Rym: and then some dude sits down and pulls out his custom set of cities that are Intricately carved silver cities with gemstones in them.

857
00:59:08,942 --> 00:59:11,712
Rym: and he's like, all right kid Let's play.

858
00:59:12,334 --> 00:59:14,260
Scott: you have your own cities for this game.

859
00:59:14,601 --> 00:59:16,326
Scott: Yeah, and your own dice.

860
00:59:16,446 --> 00:59:17,590
Rym: Yeah and your own robber.

861
00:59:19,292 --> 00:59:21,889
Scott: Yes, when I roll seven you'll be twice robbed.

862
00:59:23,551 --> 00:59:28,590
Rym: But the one thing is you could make very generic pieces and I think it'd be a cool thing at least playing with friends.

863
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,210
Scott: Yeah, you could make generic pieces that are applicable to many games.

864
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:38,050
Scott: I mean like ten colored tokens that are you know You could play with those and almost the thing is if like a bunch of us have a set like that.

865
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:43,052
Rym: That's the kind of thing where say we're thinking about an idea for a board game or an expansion for a board game We own.
