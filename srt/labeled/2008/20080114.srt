1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,017
Rym: It's Monday January 14th.

2
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:13,000
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,908
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:17,729
Rym: We talked a bit about virtualization.

5
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:24,487
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:29,420
Rym: Well, I survived a skiing.

7
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:32,329
Scott: Yeah, you and a whole bunch of other people.

8
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:37,025
Scott: Yeah barely, but not everybody Everybody indeed.

9
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:42,597
Scott: I'm sure there were some skiing accidents in the recent times However, not so many where we were.

10
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:46,825
Rym: but It was kind of funny because you know I haven't skied in over a decade.

11
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:54,609
Rym: and Scott the other Scott the more adventurous Scott who I went who with whom I went skiing Was uh, also had he hadn't skied a long time.

12
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:55,753
Rym: It was like eight years for him.

13
00:00:55,853 --> 00:01:00,235
Rym: So the whole time I usually you think I'm the one who's kind of rash.

14
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:01,763
Rym: I'm there was like screw it Let's just go.

15
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:06,828
Rym: but this time I was like, you know, maybe we should Go a little easy on this.

16
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:07,450
Rym: Maybe we should.

17
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,524
Rym: I don't know if I can still ski and he's like nah It's like riding a bike.

18
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:11,650
Rym: You never forget this deal.

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,192
Rym: No how to ski.

20
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:13,217
Rym: You'll start going down the mountain.

21
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:13,860
Rym: You'll be fine.

22
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:15,623
Rym: So we get there.

23
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:23,273
Rym: but I rent my little skis and the first thing I notice is that skis don't look Like they look the last time I skied anymore.

24
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:24,680
Rym: They look a lot different.

25
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:26,579
Scott: Are they just flat sticks?

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,639
Scott: Well, the thing is, you know pointy bit that's curved at the end and then straight in the back.

27
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:32,911
Rym: I rented skis and you know, I got.

28
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:34,700
Scott: why do they have a curved pointy bit in the front?

29
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:36,406
Rym: Well, actually they didn't.

30
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:37,911
Rym: now they don't anymore.

31
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:56,920
Rym: now they have a wide kind of like bloop at the front uh-huh, but anyway that I used to have slightly longer skis with a sharp point at the end and now they gave me shorter skis and There was a blue blobby bit at the end Which apparently makes it like ten times easier to turn and control the thing and it doesn't impact your speed at all.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,805
Rym: So it's just like technology got better.

33
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:00,510
Scott: So why didn't they make it that way originally?

34
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,851
Rym: I don't know.

35
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,665
Rym: I'm standing in my skis.

36
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:07,613
Rym: I'm like, alright and I move myself around.

37
00:02:07,653 --> 00:02:09,560
Rym: I'm like, alright, I think I remember how this goes.

38
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,257
Rym: I'm like, oh, yeah, I can do the snow plow and I can do the parallel whatever and let's go.

39
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:18,578
Rym: so He's like black diamond and I'm like bunny hill.

40
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:26,286
Rym: So we go to the bunny hill, you know, the little green go down it and we look at each other like wow That was a lot easier than I thought.

41
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:29,679
Rym: Yeah, I could turn holy crap and we didn't fall over.

42
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:35,445
Rym: Let's go to the normal hills and we did a few of the normal hills and every time we did fine I could turn.

43
00:02:35,465 --> 00:02:37,220
Rym: I got going a little fast.

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,619
Rym: I'm like, maybe I should slow down and then I slowed down and I didn't fall over.

45
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:46,579
Rym: So we're standing there at the bottom of like our third intermediate hill and Scott Johnson says to me, you know what?

46
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:59,389
Rym: Either we're really overconfident and we're missing something or we got a lot better at skiing than we were eight to ten years ago Or maybe that Particular skiing place was like easy.

47
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,594
Rym: Well, the thing is and

48
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:02,120
Scott: it was like the woods mountain in general

49
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:24,700
Rym: there is definitely some truth to the fact that with a lot of things that are physical skills if you do them along like you do them a lot and then you Stop doing them for a while and then you do them again a lot of times you almost get better After you have that interval because you kind of forget all the bad habits But you still have the muscle memory for some of the good habits and it's like you get to start all over.

50
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,817
Rym: You're born again and skiing and sometimes and that seemed to be the case.

51
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:34,547
Rym: So we're like, all right let's go over to the East Mountain hit those black diamonds and Get up.

52
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:36,244
Rym: we go down and hey This isn't so bad.

53
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:39,000
Rym: and then I stop and he's behind me and he's like, why'd you stop?

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,338
Rym: We get up there and basically a cliff and there's no way except to go down this cliff.

55
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:46,733
Rym: now We're looking at it and we're like, well, what do we do?

56
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:47,457
Rym: and I say fuck it.

57
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:47,999
Rym: I just go down.

58
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:49,630
Scott: Well, you know much of a choice.

59
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,899
Scott: I mean you can't go back up, right?

60
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:55,135
Rym: Well, what what the protocol is if you suck and you go somewhere you're not.

61
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:56,300
Rym: you're like you can't make it down.

62
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:59,779
Rym: You're supposed to just sidestep your way down the stupid mountain for like an hour.

63
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:01,871
Scott: Okay, but what if you can't even do that?

64
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:03,180
Scott: What if you're stuck on the mountain?

65
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,149
Rym: Well, then you take your skis off and you walk down.

66
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:06,315
Scott: Oh, is it so?

67
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:08,064
Scott: I thought but if it's a cliff You can't really walk.

68
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:11,340
Rym: Well, if you walk laterally eventually, you'll find a place you can walk down.

69
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:16,140
Rym: Okay, or with those you can usually walk back up or you just wait for ski patrol to find you.

70
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:18,858
Scott: Okay, let's say the ski patrol finds you then what do they do.

71
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,146
Rym: They'll probably put you on a stretcher and then pull you up the mountain or down the mountain or snowmobile or something laterally Or there's a lot of things they can do.

72
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,195
Rym: Hey, but anyway, I'm just.

73
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:31,810
Scott: I guess the mountain I'm imagining is like there's nowhere to go.

74
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:46,900
Rym: So I'm going down and I'm thinking all right this is the the moment of truth because there's a turn coming up and I wasn't sure up until this point if all the fat I'd been turning a lot and slowing down is feeding up and I couldn't Really proved myself if that was accidental.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,444
Rym: I couldn't really figure out if I was going where I expected to be going or if you're just kind of luck that I wasn't running into anything.

76
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:59,510
Rym: and now there's basically a 90-degree turn at the end of this cliff and My body just turned and everything worked.

77
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,000
Rym: So I think I can ski again.

78
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:14,962
Rym: So a lot of people can ski so fast forward about I don't know 15 minutes And we've done every black diamond except one and the one we haven't done has a big warning on it warning ungroomed Moguls.

79
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,172
Rym: now mogul is just a stupid skiing word.

80
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,679
Rym: That means a big bump.

81
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,109
Scott: Yeah, I think people know what they are.

82
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,579
Rym: I think a lot of people don't know.

83
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:23,866
Scott: How could you not know?

84
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:27,450
Rym: you live in the south and you never been skiing never seen snow And they don't need to know.

85
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:28,398
Rym: well now you do.

86
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:33,706
Rym: That's why I if I say mogul and someone's never heard of that term They're gonna think what what the fuck mogul?

87
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:37,380
Scott: if they if someone lives somewhere where there's no snow then they already stopped listening.

88
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:42,265
Rym: Probably not because skiing is interesting, especially when you see people Epically fail at it.

89
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:44,973
Scott: go on YouTube search for skiing accident.

90
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,157
Scott: Well funny stuffs.

91
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:50,200
Rym: the funniest thing I think we watched this one video where this guy he survived so it wasn't bad.

92
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:58,506
Rym: But he's doing this like basically it's this gigantic cliff and the camera zoom so far out that it's like wow I can't believe he's doing it.

93
00:05:58,546 --> 00:05:59,109
Rym: then we're watching.

94
00:05:59,129 --> 00:05:59,933
Rym: I'm like, wait a minute.

95
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:01,400
Rym: There's no way to know.

96
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,568
Rym: He's skiing for all we know.

97
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:04,420
Rym: He's just rolling down this hill.

98
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,665
Rym: He's already dead or something.

99
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,455
Rym: and then as he gets closer and zoomed in sure enough.

100
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:11,680
Rym: He hasn't been skiing for some time He's just going head over heels down this mountain.

101
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:13,305
Scott: Yeah, it was kind of.

102
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:15,276
Scott: I was afraid it was a snuff film, but it wasn't.

103
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:17,144
Rym: but then at the end He just gets up.

104
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:20,759
Rym: Yes, you see him going like ah shit, but he's fine.

105
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:22,469
Scott: Well, he wasn't fine.

106
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,716
Scott: Well, he's conscious.

107
00:06:23,877 --> 00:06:24,239
Scott: He lived.

108
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,480
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

109
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:43,805
Rym: So to make a long story short Scott Johnson and I are standing there at the top of this basically 90 foot or so cliff covered in moguls and He's basically trying to egg me into going down it and I keep saying well All right, you go first and because you're the more experienced skier and he's like, yeah All right, but he wouldn't move.

110
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:45,892
Rym: and then he's like, yeah, you'll be fine.

111
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:49,824
Rym: You'll make it and eventually I'm like, yeah I will make it I will.

112
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:50,867
Rym: let's do this.

113
00:06:51,469 --> 00:07:04,939
Rym: and I jump down and I barely come to a stop on this first mogul and I'm Maybe 10 feet down from the point of no return and I'm facing left and I'm on this mogul and I'm thinking all right There's a mogul about 10 feet down from me.

114
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:10,320
Rym: As long as I'm facing in the opposite direction by the time I get to that mogul I can do the rest of this.

115
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,263
Rym: I'm gonna be okay.

116
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:15,960
Rym: So I try to jump do a little pivot turn and I only made it about half way.

117
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,263
Rym: It's not.

118
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:17,859
Rym: I'm facing directly at the mogul.

119
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:25,680
Rym: Then I hit the mogul let him in the air Then I land on the next mogul some distance down on my stomach which bounces me back up into the air.

120
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:30,860
Rym: Then I land on my head and flip head over heels like three times and then I kind of roll to a stop.

121
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:33,828
Scott: So, why were these ungroomed when they groom them?

122
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:42,340
Rym: because that's where the awesome skiers go to have awesome times Or where people like me go to hurt myself because I mean on the Olympics they have the moguls, but they're all groomed.

123
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,328
Scott: It's like these nice even bumps like their eat.

124
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:47,120
Scott: They're all that that and the people go boing boing boing boing boing boing.

125
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,633
Rym: I mean, I saw people doing that with these moguls.

126
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:50,959
Rym: I just am not that good at skiing.

127
00:07:53,025 --> 00:08:00,129
Rym: But And the funniest thing was before we went down there was a crowd of like 10 other people Standing there like all along with us.

128
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,556
Rym: Everyone's like you're gonna do it man.

129
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:01,999
Rym: I don't know.

130
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,520
Scott: I saw someone wait a second you if you went up to the top of this thing, right?

131
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,265
Scott: Wasn't there any?

132
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:07,840
Scott: there was no option but to do it.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,603
Rym: Oh, no, there was.

134
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:13,420
Rym: I could go laterally and then there's another great completely smooth slope that I already done twice.

135
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:15,951
Scott: Okay, but what if you didn't want to do either one of those?

136
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,900
Rym: Well, then I was fucked and I was stupid.

137
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:18,486
Rym: Okay.

138
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:19,740
Scott: Yes, that sounds I was checking.

139
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:21,579
Scott: It's like when you go in the water slide, right?

140
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,369
Scott: It's like you can go up the stairs.

141
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,120
Scott: they go halfway up for the stairs to go all the way up.

142
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,640
Scott: But if you go the all the way up the stairs, you know You can't go down the stairs and there's only like maybe three slides up there.

143
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,154
Scott: It's like well, you can't go down one of the slides this half way.

144
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:36,705
Scott: Yes, you have to take Slides, you don't have a choice.

145
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:37,789
Rym: see that's the way.

146
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:44,880
Rym: skiing has this rating system and the rating system is basically How good do you have to be to guarantee that you will not hurt yourself severely?

147
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,031
Rym: And it's like the bunny hill, you know the green circle.

148
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,300
Rym: then it's the blue square, which is pretty much everything.

149
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:54,000
Rym: It's like if you are able to ski you will not hurt yourself on a blue square.

150
00:08:54,642 --> 00:09:02,345
Rym: And then there's black diamond, which is unless you are confident in your abilities and a proficient skier Then black diamond.

151
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:07,522
Rym: There's a good chance that you will break something something you don't want to break Alrighty, so.

152
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:13,599
Rym: and then there's double black diamond, which is basically I regard a short thrill more so than my own life.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,592
Rym: Okay, I don't think I'll ever ski down a black diamond.

154
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:19,360
Rym: I have no interest in that whatsoever.

155
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:21,929
Rym: I think those moguls were the worst I'll ever do.

156
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:29,512
Rym: but the funniest thing was not only was this crowd of people kind of egging Each other on and Scott Johnson included egging me on Why they egg each other on.

157
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:30,700
Scott: people want each other to get hurt.

158
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:39,280
Rym: Well, the funniest thing was ski patrol is standing there and I note that They did not stop me or anyone else from hurting themselves here.

159
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:43,279
Rym: And in fact, they were standing there smiling and I'm sure they were just waiting for us to go down.

160
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:45,186
Scott: Do they want to see someone get hurt?

161
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:48,317
Scott: I guess it makes their day interesting and she skis over.

162
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:48,779
Rym: She's like you.

163
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,879
Rym: okay I'm like, yeah, can you go get my skis?

164
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,006
Scott: Wait, how did he ski over?

165
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,015
Scott: or were they just at the top with everyone else?

166
00:09:56,035 --> 00:09:57,120
Rym: Yeah, they're just awesome skiers.

167
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,306
Rym: They just skied right down to me.

168
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,255
Scott: Oh, but they can't go back up though.

169
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,060
Scott: Once they start going down They got to go all the way down.

170
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,186
Rym: Well, they get went halfway down.

171
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:05,539
Rym: they grabbed my skis and then they went the rest of the way down.

172
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:07,867
Scott: No, and then you sort of rolled down.

173
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:12,643
Rym: then I. well actually I was still on the moguls like on the cliff when they gave Me my stuff bag.

174
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:13,568
Rym: So I spent a while.

175
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:23,385
Rym: It was really hard to put that ski back on without falling And then I get it on and I'm thinking how to fuck it and I just jump and I do the same thing I did Before but this time it worked

176
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:24,429
Scott: and I made

177
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:27,140
Rym: it down and I didn't see what happened to Scott Johnson.

178
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,860
Rym: But from what he tells me his ski fell off while he was turning and he had a similar fate.

179
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:36,384
Rym: All right, but he didn't hurt his neck like I did Get a new neck.

180
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,774
Rym: I don't think I broke my neck.

181
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:39,578
Rym: So I think I'm okay.

182
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:40,180
Scott: Your neck's no good.

183
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,647
Rym: Anyway, my neck's fine.

184
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:42,832
Scott: No, it's a crap neck.

185
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:43,656
Rym: I got a good neck.

186
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:44,620
Rym: I got a nice long neck.

187
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:48,724
Scott: now you get a. you get a better neck out of a Turkey at the supermarket.

188
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:51,835
Rym: Why you could have at least said like giraffe or something?

189
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:54,892
Rym: No, no draft They got the Kings of next right there.

190
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:56,863
Scott: your half necks are no good You do.

191
00:10:56,903 --> 00:11:01,660
Scott: you actually have a slow reaction time because it takes so long for the signal from your brain to get to your body.

192
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,199
Rym: Well, I could just have two brains.

193
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:05,691
Scott: You have two brains.

194
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:08,045
Scott: You need a third brain All right.

195
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:13,060
Scott: So, uh So last night I got like the worst sleep I got in forever.

196
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:23,300
Scott: Cuz sorry about that Should've locked your door Around like, you know, I went to bed like 10 11 ish something like that, right?

197
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:36,616
Scott: I went to bed at like 9 after taking a whole bunch of aspirin because I my neck still hurts and then Frickin, you know all of a sudden I wake up and every day And I'm like what the fuck.

198
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:42,080
Rym: and I Love that feeling where you your brain hasn't woken up enough yet to figure out what the hell's going on.

199
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:49,119
Scott: Not only was I startled and awoken right and such right, but I realized that it was the UPS's stupid UPS's.

200
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,440
Rym: now I find it funny that both UPS's in your room went off, but the one in my room was just fine.

201
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:55,400
Scott: I don't know what the fuck is going on with them.

202
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,360
Scott: I have to look it up and see what exactly that particular beat means.

203
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,810
Rym: But anyway, you know what that that's the chief UPS.

204
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,597
Rym: that beat means something happened.

205
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:06,789
Rym: Ah shit That's it UPS beefs no matter what.

206
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,816
Scott: so I just turned him off.

207
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:11,240
Scott: I didn't care I just pushed the buttons on him or shut him up as quickly as possible.

208
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:13,852
Rym: You know, that's what I did the last time that happened to me.

209
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:15,740
Scott: Yeah, do you cares that the computer just turns off?

210
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,320
Scott: I don't give a shit.

211
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,803
Scott: The thing is.

212
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:24,077
Rym: the last time that happened to me when the power actually went out I remember laying there and I hit my alarm clock until I thought I broke it and the sound didn't stop.

213
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,483
Rym: then I grabbed my Cellphone.

214
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:28,140
Rym: I'm just like squeezing it trying to hit buttons on it and nothing.

215
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:31,595
Rym: So I've got my blackberry and I'm like throwing it around like why won't it stop?

216
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:34,692
Rym: like oh wait I go over to the UPS and there that was it.

217
00:12:34,732 --> 00:12:38,187
Scott: Yeah, but yeah the Base I turn them both off.

218
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,958
Scott: then my clock was off and I'm just like fuck.

219
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,172
Scott: So I go and I take my cell phone.

220
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:47,678
Scott: I'm like, I'll set the cell phone alarm, right That's why I always use the cell phone alarm.

221
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:50,550
Scott: So I guess at the cell phone alarm to 6 a.m.

222
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,879
Scott: But the cell phone only said 1 a.m I was like fuck.

223
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:57,413
Scott: I Imagine it would be like 4 it's 3 or something or in the morning.

224
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,112
Scott: But

225
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:09,992
Rym: yeah I actually had one of those really like, you know those nights where you sleep and you feel like you slept forever And then you wake up and you only been asleep for like an hour and then you go back to sleep and the same thing Just keeps happening over and over again.

226
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:10,960
Rym: I'd like the best night's sleep.

227
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,266
Scott: I that ever lie the worst.

228
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:18,166
Scott: but then like it was not only was I just awoken rudely It wasn't just a rude awakening It was also like I was.

229
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:21,740
Scott: I was awoken while my body was like digesting something.

230
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:29,215
Scott: So my stomach was like all uncomfortable Like I felt like complete shit, but I I went back to bed right.

231
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:33,099
Scott: but then a few hours later Like I never got fully awoken again.

232
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:39,943
Scott: But I never actually got fully to sleep for an extended period of time because all sorts of plows and other things outside Kept in.

233
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,573
Rym: Oh, yeah, because of that blizzard.

234
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,717
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't a blizzard It was supposed to be a blizzard.

235
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:51,120
Scott: Yeah It was just being a bit of snow like not even an inch and it was just kind of it melted in the mornings.

236
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,783
Scott: It's just wet.

237
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:52,827
Scott: It was just mush.

238
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:55,980
Rym: But well when I got up there was actually still snow everywhere.

239
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,160
Scott: Yeah, all these plows and things kept fucking intermittently waking me up partially.

240
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:01,560
Scott: He's terrible.

241
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:04,203
Rym: So, huh.

242
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:09,260
Scott: and then in the morning right I wanted to like, you know, I had to update my iPod whatever.

243
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:11,675
Scott: So I wanted to like VNC to the downstairs whatever.

244
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:12,340
Scott: so get my laptop.

245
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,372
Scott: I turn it on but I can't get DHCP because the server's off.

246
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,360
Rym: Oh pie cuz he turned the UPS off.

247
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:19,835
Scott: so I was trying to like turn back on the.

248
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:26,240
Scott: You know the DHCP on the server on the on the router, so I'd had to turn the server back on.

249
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:34,111
Rym: You know, you could set up an alternate network profile where if you don't have a lease and whatever It'll just take an IP address.

250
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:35,979
Rym: just reserve once then no one else gets it with DHCP.

251
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,567
Scott: I know I know and then set it up with.

252
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:40,633
Rym: you know, it's like 129 21 21 1 my favorite DNS server in the world.

253
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,380
Rym: No, I still use that thing, but then I was gonna.

254
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:47,770
Scott: Basically, what I did is I just took the server.

255
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,775
Scott: I turned the UPS.

256
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:49,720
Scott: I unplugged the server.

257
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:50,771
Scott: I turned the UPS on.

258
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:51,316
Scott: it didn't beep.

259
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,640
Scott: I plugged the server into the non battery-powered port and then I turned the laptop on and I went.

260
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:59,825
Scott: Yeah, it was it was not good.

261
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:04,760
Scott: Hopefully tonight will be better and I gotta do some UPS research to solve this fucking problem.

262
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,673
Scott: I never want to be awoken rudely by my computer not turning off.

263
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:10,760
Scott: I mean it should only beep of this trouble.

264
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:13,088
Rym: Well, the thing is we bought the cheapest you.

265
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:15,536
Rym: they don't have any sort of intelligent communication at all.

266
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:24,644
Scott: They have two modes working and I Just wish they wouldn't go Just fucking.

267
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:28,479
Scott: if you're not working just fucking, you know, drain your battery and then shut up.

268
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,910
Rym: Well, you could just buy a better UPS.

269
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,656
Scott: I think that's what's gonna happen.

270
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:34,620
Scott: It's what's gotta happen.

271
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:40,934
Rym: so speaking of UPS is According to slash dot Ford claims ownership of your pictures.

272
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:41,878
Scott: There's nothing to do.

273
00:15:42,038 --> 00:15:46,416
Rym: UPS UPS that's my classic non sequitur sequitur.

274
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,444
Scott: It's not good You don't like it.

275
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:49,106
Scott: No fine.

276
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:50,831
Rym: You try to say I don't like it.

277
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:53,640
Rym: You're trying to segue from UPS's into Ford.

278
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,666
Scott: How about here?

279
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:56,194
Scott: I have some news that's unrelated.

280
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,039
Scott: Let me read it to you.

281
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,220
Rym: It's barely even tech news, but it's copyright and I feel like that seems to fall under Monday.

282
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:08,132
Scott: Well, I think it's intellectual property and technology Really are two separate topics law and technology.

283
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:28,699
Scott: But the thing is is that Geeks are really only interested in law unless they're law geeks When it relates to technology and it seems to relate to technology quite a bit in fact it seems to relate to all geekeries and specifically the intellectual property law seems to relate to all geekeries because all geekeries are all about creating and using intellectual property in some way.

284
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:31,840
Rym: There might have been a momentary interruption there.

285
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,699
Rym: I'm not even gonna try to cover it over because I don't really care.

286
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:38,560
Rym: but Speaking of we were talking about UPS's and power going out.

287
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:52,160
Rym: I was fiddling with my computer for various reasons and I'd rebooted and I changed my grub and everything and I forgot to disable APIC and LAPIC which on my motherboard with the current Linux kernels is a trouble.

288
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:54,548
Scott: I thought you uh, are you like gut seeing?

289
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:55,773
Scott: shouldn't that fix that problem?

290
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,680
Rym: No, he doesn't fix that for shit.

291
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:58,588
Scott: No, they shouldn't.

292
00:16:58,628 --> 00:16:59,879
Scott: that's gets kind of screwed up.

293
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:02,087
Rym: Yeah, it is but I look on the internet.

294
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,198
Rym: everyone has this problem with his motherboard and with similar motherboards.

295
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,186
Scott: So That's that's the kind of shit needs fixing.

296
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:11,159
Rym: thing is APIC has always been finicky with Linux.

297
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:14,780
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what the hell that problem is because I never had a problem with it on my computer.

298
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:17,258
Rym: I think it depends on just what chipsets and whatever.

299
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:21,231
Rym: but Anyway, so my computer crashed but luckily.

300
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,619
Rym: luckily because we're all cool here.

301
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:32,755
Rym: I mean, I got my UPS and everything, but I also have the Marantz plugged into the UPS Recording to flash all the time with the fancy mixer.

302
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:33,800
Rym: that lets me do this trivially.

303
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,227
Rym: So I got a backup no matter what.

304
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:37,351
Scott: Oh backups.

305
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:39,638
Scott: So before this part of the show, it was all backup.

306
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,271
Rym: Yep So also I'll find out now if I've set that up right to sound good But it should sound the same as the normal show.

307
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,863
Rym: So let me know if it sounded different All right.

308
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:59,100
Rym: Anyway, anyway, the gist of this story is that Someone some group of like auto enthusiasts own some Ford cars that they fancify up and cuz they're a little club.

309
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:07,079
Rym: They wanted to make a poster or a cat like a calendar Yep, and every month has pictures of the cars they own with all the fancy things they've done to them.

310
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:17,800
Rym: They were gonna sell it among themselves as a little fundraiser and cafe press or whatever and then a Ford Motor Company stepped in and said ah, we own the trademark to Ford cars.

311
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:19,906
Rym: Fuck you, if you do that will sue you.

312
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:22,654
Scott: well, that's not exactly.

313
00:18:22,674 --> 00:18:25,862
Rym: what they exactly did was trademark Infringement.

314
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:33,874
Scott: that cannot be done through cafe press whatever exactly, you know cafe press was like and then Ford was like cafe press.

315
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:34,379
Scott: don't do that.

316
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:46,808
Rym: Yeah, effectively what Ford has said is that if you take even if you own a Ford car You cannot in any way use other than you know Non-trademark infringing ways though.

317
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:50,640
Rym: I'm dubious as to how much of a trademark infringement this is, but I'll get to that.

318
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:55,780
Scott: Yeah, I mean what if I take a picture of my car and put it on Flickr with a Creative Commons license?

319
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,663
Scott: How am I doing?

320
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:57,386
Scott: Is that wrong?

321
00:18:57,406 --> 00:18:58,429
Rym: Yeah, or what if?

322
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,360
Rym: what if I want to make a t-shirt for myself of my car?

323
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:05,480
Rym: What if I want to make a t-shirt to sell to my friends of my car that I added a spin is to?

324
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,573
Rym: Yeah, see now what really bothers me.

325
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:09,979
Rym: is that in my mind?

326
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,660
Rym: Trademarks exist for two reasons because remember copyright and trademark and all these things didn't just always exist.

327
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:27,053
Rym: They were created in the in the legal structure of the United States for specific purposes and with trademark I'm of the mind that it serves two purposes or at least should serve two purposes.

328
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:34,408
Rym: that one it protects Corporations that have a that have a good standing in the marketplace because of their name.

329
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,378
Rym: say I'm Joey Jojo Shabbadoo shoes.

330
00:19:39,181 --> 00:20:02,358
Rym: Well trademark prevents someone else from making Joey Jojo Shabbadoo shoes because you see I'm Joey Jojo And I run Joey Jojo Shabbadoo shoes now if someone else wanted to make Joey Jojo Shabbadoo computers There's nothing wrong with that because there's no way in the world an intelligent person would mistake Joey Jojo Shabbadoo computers for Joey Jojo Shabbadoo shoes mm-hmm.

331
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,043
Rym: now These there's.

332
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:17,368
Rym: there have been complications these ideas in the past like the fact that the only reason Apple computers was able to exist under That name despite the fact that there was also the Apple music label was because Apple computers agreed that it would only be computers and stuff and never music.

333
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:24,201
Rym: and then uh iTunes on all that came and the iPod and there was trickiness and that all worked out luckily But

334
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:25,145
Scott: well kinda

335
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:34,078
Rym: it worked out as best as it could have as far as we care yeah, but And the only other purpose I see the trademark has is that it protects consumers.

336
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:34,680
Scott: who?

337
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:43,566
Rym: Can use the names of companies to have a kind of to know how good or bad a company is to see the company's track record To be discerning consumers?

338
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:50,440
Rym: if I know that Joey Jojo Shabbadoo pizza tastes like ass Then I know not to buy Joey Jojo Shabbadoo.

339
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:52,467
Scott: Imagine if you know people.

340
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:56,300
Scott: I mean we look at brands right and brands for marketing people are awesome.

341
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,620
Scott: They love brands because they you know they can just market the brand itself.

342
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:06,460
Scott: They can get you to love the brand And then it doesn't matter what the actual thing is because you love the brand and that's a marketing people love to do.

343
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:11,251
Scott: But on the same token if we got rid of brands all together You'd be fucked.

344
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:12,199
Scott: you go to the store.

345
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:21,218
Rym: There'd be all these things with all these different labels on them or maybe no labels on the eight different Domino sugars and you know which one's the real domino sugar that you trust and which one is.

346
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,020
Rym: Joey Jojo Shabbadoo's found it in a truck that crashed somewhere.

347
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,384
Scott: Exactly so.

348
00:21:26,424 --> 00:21:27,470
Rym: first you get the sugar.

349
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:28,235
Scott: You know it's like.

350
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:29,020
Scott: how would you you?

351
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:38,638
Scott: While brands are used to market to you and to get you to do things they also Protect you in a way because you you can you know you can trust something like.

352
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:41,980
Scott: you know What if there are all these iPods at the store and one of them was the real?

353
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:47,933
Scott: Apple iPod made by Apple you know And the other ones who knows God knows what Apple iPods.

354
00:21:47,993 --> 00:22:08,480
Rym: I think a good reference here is the V. Yeah, the V but I'm of the mind that no intelligent person would mistake a Small auto enthusiast club that fancify up their Ford cars for the Ford Motor Company That makes cars especially since it's not like this cut.

355
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:13,540
Rym: It's not like this little Motor Club is selling their Ford cars as Ford cars.

356
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:16,632
Scott: Yeah There's that they took pictures of cars

357
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:18,400
Rym: that they own and they modify

358
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:27,525
Scott: Right and they made a calendar out of pictures that they took and the pictures they own the legal right to those pictures They took them right and they want to make a calendar out of pictures They took.

359
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:29,660
Scott: they're not competing with the Ford Motor Company.

360
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:35,500
Scott: The what they're doing does it doesn't harm the trademark of the Ford Motor Company in any way.

361
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:36,445
Scott: It's not.

362
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:37,410
Scott: you know damaging.

363
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:39,060
Scott: it won't give people you know.

364
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:46,324
Scott: If this calendar will not change people's minds to make them think the Ford Motor Company is bad in any way It's really just bullshit.

365
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,049
Scott: I don't think trademark should apply at all.

366
00:22:48,630 --> 00:23:00,080
Rym: So yeah, I don't know what the actual legal full result of this will be but I Feel that the moral imperative is on the side of the small auto enthusiast club and not the Ford Motor Company.

367
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,775
Rym: I'd say I'll boycott Ford but I've never owned a Ford.

368
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,946
Scott: if I never will I Guess my Mazda is a Ford.

369
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:10,520
Rym: Yeah, but if you want to get into the semantics about who actually makes cars.

370
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:12,479
Rym: That's a whole other show.

371
00:23:16,164 --> 00:23:21,330
Rym: All right granted I've driven nothing but like Pontiac so Well, it's the same as a Chevy.

372
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:22,840
Scott: Yep, and whatever.

373
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:28,137
Scott: Anyway, so a lot of things happen to the CES and we could talk about a whole bunch of them.

374
00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:31,872
Scott: probably over the next few Weeks, we'll probably whittle through them as Oh next week.

375
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,700
Rym: I'm gonna talk about nothing but laptops.

376
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,657
Scott: okay, but anyway and You know the Mac world the big Steve Jobs is tomorrow.

377
00:23:40,777 --> 00:23:45,716
Rym: Oh, man I might watch it live just because if they announce don't watch it live, that's stupid.

378
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:46,860
Scott: Just go to engage it, right?

379
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,244
Scott: No, no does the live blog?

380
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:53,572
Rym: cuz I didn't lay when I was at IBM the way I quote-unquote watch it live was I went to IRC.

381
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,805
Scott: No Just go to engage it.

382
00:23:56,825 --> 00:24:07,086
Scott: and there's a live blog and they're doing the live blog this time where the newest parts are at the Really yes, cuz they was a vote today on and gadget because they usually put the newest stuff at the bottom Which is not what I wanted.

383
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:09,400
Scott: It's a reload scroll reload scroll.

384
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:20,680
Scott: But the reason they do it that way is that when all is said and done someone who comes to the site after the event is over can read it straight through and What they're gonna do is while the event is going on they're gonna do it with the newest stuff at the top.

385
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:22,024
Rym: All right That's my solution now.

386
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:26,485
Scott: and then you just reload the page as it goes on and as soon as it's over They're gonna flip the whole thing up.

387
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:32,814
Rym: because if Apple announces a laptop that is cool enough for me I am but it's pretty much if they announce a cool laptop.

388
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:33,919
Rym: I'm buying it.

389
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,844
Scott: Well, I don't know.

390
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:36,070
Scott: you got to come down to the store.

391
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:36,774
Scott: Check it out.

392
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:37,699
Scott: You can't be too sure about.

393
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:44,742
Rym: well No as in when I say I'm buying it I mean unless something unless a factor appears to dissuade me I will buy it.

394
00:24:45,103 --> 00:24:51,404
Rym: now a factor might appear like it's eight thousand dollars or I go to the store and everyone I try breaks And smells like cheese.

395
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:55,740
Scott: I think I think they definitely depends on great many factors whether it be worth buying.

396
00:24:56,221 --> 00:25:00,776
Rym: But at the same time if I'm dissuaded then I already know what laptop I'm gonna buy.

397
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:05,904
Rym: and if I'm dissuaded from that I've got like nine other choices because it's laptop season, baby It sure is.

398
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:06,206
Scott: All right.

399
00:25:06,226 --> 00:25:08,539
Scott: But anyway, a lot of things happen there.

400
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:14,505
Scott: Some of them were more interesting than others there, but it wasn't like super huge It wasn't super great.

401
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:18,660
Scott: But regardless the one thing that I thought was particularly interesting, right?

402
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,875
Scott: Let me tell you this story in the world of people who care about gadgets and whatnot.

403
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:25,260
Scott: They're basically two blogs.

404
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:27,349
Scott: There's gizmodo and in gadget.

405
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:29,679
Rym: right now one of these two might be better.

406
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:32,808
Scott: Well, okay what happened originally?

407
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:34,214
Scott: there was just gizmodo.

408
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:34,756
Scott: It was the only.

409
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:35,780
Scott: it was the one right?

410
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,913
Scott: I guess there are other gadget blogs, but gizmodo was the big one started by mr.

411
00:25:39,576 --> 00:25:41,422
Scott: Peter Rojas Rojas.

412
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:43,627
Scott: anyway, he's cool guy rock jaw.

413
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:45,010
Scott: No Peter Rojas.

414
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:50,003
Scott: Oh no, so he started gizmodo and It was.

415
00:25:50,305 --> 00:25:54,025
Scott: I don't know if it was part of Gawker media from the beginning It doesn't matter but it was part.

416
00:25:54,065 --> 00:25:59,503
Scott: It's part of Gawker media now, and that's a company that owns Kotaku and Joystick.

417
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:02,199
Scott: I think now not joystick and gadget and joystick are together.

418
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:11,640
Scott: No, they own Kotaku and Jalopnik, that's the one and all button Gawker and anyway, and they own a bunch of blogs.

419
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,805
Scott: They're all together right.

420
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:16,360
Scott: and then there's in gadget, which is part of weblogs Inc, right?

421
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,315
Scott: Basically Peter Rojas left gizmodo because weblogs Inc.

422
00:26:21,335 --> 00:26:24,785
Scott: hired him and which is a Well, which is Time Warner, which is right.

423
00:26:25,206 --> 00:26:30,280
Scott: So in gadget is is owned by AOL and so is joystick and whatever.

424
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:39,414
Scott: So Peter Rojas now works for the in gadget and even though he started the gizmodo and the gizmodo is still owned by Gawker Which is the same people's Kotaku and it's separate.

425
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:44,015
Scott: This is not what you care about No, and for a while, they've been sort of the competing gadget blogs.

426
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,080
Rym: Yes competing.

427
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:49,440
Rym: I have many analogies as to what kind of competition it is or who might be winning.

428
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:53,520
Scott: Well for a while it was pretty much they were almost exactly the same site.

429
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,460
Scott: You can see the same stories on both sides with slightly different writing similar pictures.

430
00:26:57,922 --> 00:27:01,114
Scott: It wasn't really one wasn't better than the other it was just huh?

431
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:02,780
Scott: There's two sites and he read both of them.

432
00:27:02,861 --> 00:27:04,440
Scott: You can't possibly miss any gadget news.

433
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,544
Scott: It won't happen right.

434
00:27:06,106 --> 00:27:10,900
Scott: and gadget has some spin-offs like in gadget HD or in gadget mobile, but those don't matter anyway.

435
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:15,080
Scott: It all started to go downhill for gizmodo quite recently.

436
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:20,150
Scott: Basically there was an incident where Kotaku remember owned by the same people as gizmodo.

437
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,801
Scott: gizmodo basically I don't know.

438
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:29,562
Scott: they must have had access to Kotaku somehow because they're both the same company and they put the horrible tub girl picture on Kotaku.

439
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:40,668
Rym: now had they put a pirate flag or a fake story or a Picture of the laughing man or just change the logo to their logo.

440
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:41,830
Rym: That would have been awesome.

441
00:27:42,873 --> 00:27:48,309
Rym: Tub girl like you know There's a line like having a bucket of water over a door is a good prank.

442
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:53,604
Rym: Having a bucket of tire irons that really kind of goes beyond prank and into criminal assault.

443
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:54,306
Scott: pretty much.

444
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:56,774
Scott: and this is the same company Here, you know.

445
00:27:56,874 --> 00:28:02,896
Scott: and it's like what the hell they doing in Kotaku, you know Kotaku's owned by the same company But the editors and writers over there.

446
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:03,960
Scott: They're they're professionals.

447
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:04,262
Scott: They're not.

448
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,527
Scott: they're like what the fuck gizmodo.

449
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:08,121
Scott: That was fucking stupid You know, what's the fuck is wrong with you?

450
00:28:08,182 --> 00:28:14,950
Scott: It's like it's like this Misbehaving child and they had to give it a spanking, you know, it's like it's like if your sibling is all misbehaving.

451
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,733
Scott: You're like what the fuck?

452
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:16,214
Scott: Yeah.

453
00:28:16,716 --> 00:28:20,850
Scott: So anyway, that was that was the start of gizmodo's downhill and that was around around that point.

454
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,721
Scott: I just thought I cut them out of my you know, blah.

455
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:24,886
Scott: All right, Google Reader there.

456
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:25,870
Scott: He's now goodbye.

457
00:28:26,214 --> 00:28:32,125
Rym: I I would wager that gizmodo Really really wants to kind of have this image of.

458
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:33,270
Rym: where are the edgy ones?

459
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,539
Rym: We're the people who who do the bad things.

460
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:38,229
Rym: We're the bad boys of gadget news.

461
00:28:38,892 --> 00:28:41,323
Rym: Because that because they pulled this shit again, I don't know.

462
00:28:41,363 --> 00:28:42,950
Scott: Yeah, basically at CES, right?

463
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:51,070
Scott: They got a TV be gone and a TV be gone If you don't know is this little thing and it's you know, you push a button on it and it has in it programmed.

464
00:28:51,475 --> 00:29:02,090
Rym: You know the power button infrared codes for basically every television and it's kind of cycles through them in order of like which ones are most popular out there to try to Turn off every TV in the vicinity, right?

465
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:08,859
Scott: So you just point it at some TVs push the button and wait and it eventually like a minute or two Will probably turn those TVs off.

466
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:11,370
Scott: if you know, they're infrared receivers aren't blocked.

467
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:17,745
Scott: So they went around CES and turn TVs off while people are giving presentations on those TVs.

468
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:21,158
Scott: now, I Mean for an attendee of CES.

469
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:25,760
Scott: this could be like a funny joke if you're just some punk kids But I mean you're depressed.

470
00:29:26,142 --> 00:29:27,410
Scott: they had pressed badges.

471
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,609
Scott: They're professionals going around turning off TVs of people's presentations like he.

472
00:29:32,652 --> 00:29:39,109
Rym: Now the thing is if they had done it just once to a Rival or something and then they came up straight forward like yeah, that was us.

473
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:43,906
Scott: No, they posted it on their site and then later they were like shit guys.

474
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:44,930
Scott: Maybe that wasn't so funny.

475
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:50,188
Scott: Yeah, maybe we better write something But yeah, they put it on their site to get traffic to it.

476
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:52,570
Scott: now I heard a thing on twit this morning.

477
00:29:52,690 --> 00:30:01,730
Scott: Apparently the way the writers at gizmo at Gawker media are paid is they get paid a base salary But then they get paid based on the traffic they drive.

478
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,990
Scott: So if more people read your articles that you write for Gawker media, then you get more money.

479
00:30:06,512 --> 00:30:09,630
Scott: So it's definitely a traffic, you know move they want it.

480
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:13,806
Scott: You know, they put that video of them turning TVs off on gizmodo and then people will come to see it.

481
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:18,117
Scott: now Just to show you how on you go.

482
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:19,723
Scott: listen our episode of being professional.

483
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:29,004
Scott: if you have any questions about this Why gizmodo is totally lame even though you know The first geek instinct might be to think that they're cool thing is there's.

484
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:30,470
Rym: I use this example a lot.

485
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,610
Rym: I think it's a good example, but there are a lot of other examples.

486
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:42,134
Rym: There's professionalism and then there is unprofessionalism and in between the two there is a magic land called Professionally unprofessional.

487
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:52,869
Rym: I think Dave and Joel's fast karate are good example of that where it feels really like unprofessional by the seat of the Pants, but at the same time it's really well done and put together and they're probably like what the fuck is I'm talking about.

488
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:58,790
Rym: But I've said this before because they have that they feel a lot less professional than they really are.

489
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:00,629
Rym: But they don't feel that in a bad way.

490
00:31:01,332 --> 00:31:04,603
Rym: But gizmodo definitely doesn't has not achieved that balance.

491
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:05,466
Scott: No, they haven't.

492
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:06,690
Scott: they're definitely just unprofessional.

493
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:13,635
Scott: I mean and this isn't just you like some gizmodo writer we're talking about here if I was CES I probably would have banned them.

494
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:17,387
Scott: Oh, they banned the guy who did it for life from CES.

495
00:31:17,447 --> 00:31:18,230
Rym: Oh, I would have banned.

496
00:31:19,452 --> 00:31:21,240
Scott: Yes, I would have also banned all of gizmo.

497
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,569
Rym: I was out event all of gizmodo for one year.

498
00:31:23,971 --> 00:31:25,920
Scott: I would have been all of Gawker media forever.

499
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:28,190
Rym: Whoo, cuz then Gawker would have come down.

500
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:29,376
Scott: Well, you know, there's no one.

501
00:31:29,396 --> 00:31:33,545
Scott: there's no other people at Gawker who want to go to CES anyway, but no I mean they would have come down on.

502
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:40,306
Scott: But this is the gizmodo editor Brian lamb is it wasn't you know some writer.

503
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:41,550
Scott: this was the editor of gizmodo.

504
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,850
Scott: So there's definitely this culture of unprofessional sort of loserish is going on at gizmodo.

505
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,472
Scott: That's not good.

506
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,941
Scott: and to show you just how unprofessional this is.

507
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:52,390
Scott: Let me read the comments from dig.

508
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:53,519
Scott: I'm gonna read the day.

509
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:54,809
Rym: What are you going to dig for?

510
00:31:55,211 --> 00:32:02,639
Scott: Listen, this will show you how bad it is how much how terrible it is If the dig comments are saying this, you know, it's bad.

511
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:03,020
Scott: You're ready.

512
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:03,823
Scott: I'm ready.

513
00:32:04,104 --> 00:32:05,550
Scott: top cam comment on dig.

514
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:08,529
Scott: That's what happens in you act like a fucking douche.

515
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:13,330
Scott: Some of that video is funny but screwing over the guy who was trying to give a presentation was just plain fucked.

516
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,058
Scott: Wow and then the next one.

517
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,326
Scott: good that's exactly what should have happened.

518
00:32:19,386 --> 00:32:22,416
Scott: CES is a place for journalists Not dim-witted pranksters screwing up.

519
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:25,126
Scott: Everyone's presentations extremely low-class.

520
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:28,215
Rym: on gizmodo's part Yeah coming out of dig.

521
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:30,904
Rym: It's kind of frightening to get something like dig.

522
00:32:31,044 --> 00:32:36,783
Scott: comments are calling you unprofessional And they're saying that what you did was a dick move in low-class.

523
00:32:37,144 --> 00:32:41,970
Scott: You got to feel pretty bad if as It's like a fortune was calling you low-class.

524
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:43,522
Scott: That's bad.

525
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:53,905
Scott: But yeah, the basically the thing that everyone's talking about now is like, oh is this gonna make you know Bloggers look bad and look unprofessional in general?

526
00:32:53,946 --> 00:33:09,438
Scott: and I'm like, no I don't think so because I think in gadget showed the bloggers are very professional and high quality just makes gizmodo Look like a bunch of losers, which they are things of the day.

527
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:12,120
Rym: So this video is pretty cool.

528
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:12,966
Rym: I'd recommend you watch.

529
00:33:13,006 --> 00:33:13,953
Rym: it's one of those art.

530
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:20,220
Rym: films is definitely Designed to be poignant and to make you think or feel something and be a little piece of art.

531
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:29,688
Rym: But what I've linked to here is just a video of 100 people aged 1 to 100 in order Striking a drum one time each.

532
00:33:29,728 --> 00:33:31,153
Scott: well not exactly well.

533
00:33:31,173 --> 00:33:36,374
Rym: that one guy misses a bunch of times That other guy hits it a whole bunch and that one guy actually knew how to drum.

534
00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:39,439
Scott: Yeah, but This is the same drum.

535
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:50,202
Rym: this is a really interesting video because you basically see the progression of human aging among a whole bunch of different people and what I found the most fascinating was that pretty

536
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:50,483
Scott: much

537
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:56,015
Rym: people are in general pretty together with it up until about the 40s 50s and

538
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,281
Scott: Then

539
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:01,673
Rym: it seems like half the people are really sad and really bad.

540
00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:12,027
Rym: and after people are super energetic And once you get past like 70, the only people left are pretty awesome Generally energetic people surprisingly.

541
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:18,119
Rym: It's like if you're if you're well enough to make it past a certain point You're probably gonna make it a whole lot longer than that.

542
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:27,840
Scott: another thing I noticed is that you know in the middle in you know, Pretty much the the health and the the vitality of people is pretty is a nice curve, you know as you would expect.

543
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:38,820
Scott: But when you get to the deep end where people are really old Like there were some 90 year olds who were looking better than some 70 year olds in there, you know It's really like hey kind of mixes up Yeah.

544
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,831
Rym: and the sad thing is once you hit 90 or so it really drops off.

545
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:47,429
Rym: and I'll admit that the way it ends is actually Kind of touching and sad.

546
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:56,540
Rym: and it is kind of sad how I guess The older people got after a certain point the more confused they were as to what what they're doing and what's going on in the room.

547
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,367
Scott: Yeah, some of them seemed happy though.

548
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:03,596
Rym: Oh, yeah, there's there's one old guy for it was like 80 or something 81 I think but I don't remember which number.

549
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:10,400
Rym: but There's this one old guy with white hair and I think he was the most distinguished looking gentleman I have ever seen.

550
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,728
Scott: Oh, yeah, that guy is a good guy.

551
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:13,196
Rym: Yeah, you'll know the guy when you see him.

552
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:16,775
Rym: You'll think wow That's James Bond if he were real and he were 80.

553
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:17,740
Scott: Yeah, that was a good guy.

554
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,161
Scott: I liked him.

555
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,333
Rym: that guy was probably some Duke or Lord or something.

556
00:35:21,373 --> 00:35:21,915
Scott: Who knows?

557
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:26,591
Scott: anyway, a lot of them were In the UK the Albion's Albion.

558
00:35:26,671 --> 00:35:28,016
Scott: I sounded like it at least.

559
00:35:28,177 --> 00:35:30,863
Rym: they were definitely Albion Australian.

560
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:31,485
Scott: we're all stupid.

561
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:32,248
Rym: I can't tell.

562
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:32,871
Rym: I'm sorry.

563
00:35:33,071 --> 00:35:33,553
Scott: Whatever.

564
00:35:33,573 --> 00:35:42,040
Rym: I can tell the difference between a fake Albionic accent I almost had accident and I'm sure there's a joke there and a fake Australian accent.

565
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,120
Scott: Well a fake Albionic accent does sound like a accident bloody hell.

566
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:47,977
Scott: Anyway.

567
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,417
Scott: So on this show in the past I have talked about the fake medicines and how they pissed me off.

568
00:35:57,538 --> 00:35:58,100
Scott: homie apathy.

569
00:35:58,301 --> 00:35:58,984
Rym: It's not real.

570
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:01,740
Scott: It's not real and there's a lot of fake medicines that pissed me off.

571
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,000
Scott: And if you know think about it whether you not even considering any specific fake medicine.

572
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,640
Scott: Imagine if there was a fake medicine and someone was selling it as if it was real.

573
00:36:11,242 --> 00:36:12,889
Scott: Isn't that like the worst thing ever?

574
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:23,099
Scott: now people who are sick and maybe Possibly could be cured and helped by real medicine are now instead using fake medicine and dying because someone fooled them into doing so.

575
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:28,320
Scott: It's it's pretty close to murder on the on the list of evil things selling fake medicine.

576
00:36:28,842 --> 00:36:34,099
Scott: So fake medicine is bad whether you particularly think any particular medicine is fake or not.

577
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:36,827
Scott: now Hey, you know it.

578
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:45,276
Scott: usually you hear people like me or James or Andy or some other non science people talking about fake medicine.

579
00:36:45,356 --> 00:36:48,122
Scott: science people People right.

580
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:49,025
Scott: so.

581
00:36:49,326 --> 00:36:52,415
Scott: and you also hear fake medicine people talking about their own fake medicine.

582
00:36:52,455 --> 00:37:05,640
Scott: and you hear well-meaning but you know deluded people who believe in fake medicine talking about how the fake medicine is so great and It's it's pretty hard to actually get doctors or anyone who's you know?

583
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,760
Scott: Sort of a someone you can trust a little bit more to talk about the fake medicine because they're too busy just doing medicine.

584
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:16,950
Scott: It's the same reason it's hard to get like a lot of Biologists to start, you know talking about evolution.

585
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,978
Rym: It's like when those quaint crazy nut jobs come.

586
00:37:18,998 --> 00:37:23,578
Rym: they're like, yeah I have a quantum perpetual motion machine blah blah blah and quantum.

587
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,849
Rym: and they say yeah And the quantum physicists won't take me seriously.

588
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:27,912
Rym: They they're afraid of me.

589
00:37:27,932 --> 00:37:29,577
Scott: The quantum says is just ignoring.

590
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:30,420
Scott: you could be so dumb.

591
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,672
Rym: He's doing quantum physics.

592
00:37:31,692 --> 00:37:32,480
Rym: He doesn't care about you.

593
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,013
Rym: He already knows you're wrong and stupid.

594
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:36,527
Rym: and he just assumed Yeah, people are smart enough to realize that.

595
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:54,000
Scott: and the problem is that us smart people who are not quite if you're a physicist You're smart enough to spend your time doing quantum physics and ignoring people who say that perpetual motion machine And it creates a predicament for people like us who are smart like to know the perpetual motion machines are fake But don't have the credentials to sort of convince people more easily.

596
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,200
Rym: I like how you the way you phrase that and that kind of the pacing and the diction you use.

597
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:04,860
Rym: I guess diction isn't the right word, but you get my point was very much set up to equate us smart people with quantum physicists.

598
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:05,707
Scott: Yes.

599
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:06,473
Scott: Yes.

600
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:07,360
Scott: Anyway anyway.

601
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:11,455
Scott: So anyway, there's a blog that started semi recently.

602
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:17,978
Scott: it started on January 1st 2008. it's a very new blog and it's very very awesome.

603
00:38:17,998 --> 00:38:25,840
Scott: this blog You know who blogs on this blog bloggers for doctors doctors in what real doctors?

604
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,593
Rym: Because I have a doctorate from a couple of fake internet schools.

605
00:38:29,814 --> 00:38:32,280
Scott: Okay, let me tell you the knit before I will give you the credential.

606
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,000
Scott: I was gonna let you read the credentials of the four doctors on the site yourself, but I will read them to you.

607
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:42,220
Scott: Okay, first doctor Steven Novella academic clinical neurologist at Yale.

608
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:53,919
Scott: So he probably knows about the kiki booba, maybe doctor number two Wallace Sampson graduate of UC Berkeley with MD from UCSF a recovering hematologist oncologist.

609
00:38:55,348 --> 00:39:04,932
Scott: He's old Harriet Hall MD known as the skep doc is a retired family physician who writes about pseudoscience As a BA and MD from University of Washington.

610
00:39:05,153 --> 00:39:09,790
Rym: and the fourth one guys intention Internship in the Air Force.

611
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,559
Scott: Yes, the fourth MD guys.

612
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:18,480
Scott: The fourth one is David H Gorski MD PhD.

613
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,729
Scott: He is a surgical oncologist specializing in the breast cancer.

614
00:39:21,749 --> 00:39:24,999
Scott: And actually I read his recent thing talking about breast cancer Randy.

615
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:30,180
Scott: But anyway Let me tell you some of the titles of some of the articles that are on this science blog.

616
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:33,380
Scott: The first one is announcing the science-based medicine blog.

617
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,497
Scott: Oh, by the way, the URL of this site is science-based medicine org all lowercase.

618
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:39,098
Scott: No spaces.

619
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:39,560
Scott: No hyphens.

620
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,318
Scott: No, nothing just science-based medicine org and will link to it.

621
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:48,180
Scott: Of course All right, the plant versus pharmaceutical false dichotomy.

622
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,980
Scott: Scrolling up homeopathy and evidence-based medicine back to the future part one.

623
00:39:54,603 --> 00:40:01,444
Rym: It really bothers me that even that in this day and age You actually have to say the words Evidence-based.

624
00:40:01,644 --> 00:40:05,235
Rym: Yeah, because there's some people there are people who think there's an alternative.

625
00:40:05,255 --> 00:40:05,997
Scott: Well, it's actually.

626
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:06,880
Scott: it's really new.

627
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,933
Scott: I mean, how long really have we had Western science-based medicine?

628
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,578
Scott: Oh, yes, not even not even 200 years.

629
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,504
Scott: No, I've been my point.

630
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:16,469
Rym: However, is that we've got it.

631
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:17,512
Rym: We shouldn't?

632
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:20,040
Rym: it's like we've already transcended making stuff up.

633
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,026
Rym: We've already transcended just giving people stuff.

634
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:31,480
Scott: and now that we think about how long did it take, you know, we had evolution You know, not even as long and it still it takes time for the ideas to get around.

635
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:32,545
Rym: It is kind of scary.

636
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:35,219
Scott: How long did it take for us to get rid of you know?

637
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:37,932
Scott: Earth is the center of the solar system.

638
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:41,085
Rym: Well, there are people but You know, all right.

639
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:41,868
Scott: So who am I?

640
00:40:41,948 --> 00:40:42,651
Scott: is another title?

641
00:40:42,711 --> 00:40:43,092
Scott: Who am I?

642
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:43,695
Scott: Why am I here?

643
00:40:44,437 --> 00:40:50,252
Scott: That's great Mercury in vaccines as a cause of autism and autism spectrum disorders.

644
00:40:50,332 --> 00:40:51,496
Scott: a failed hypothesis.

645
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:55,011
Rym: Ah That's that's one of my biggest pet peeve issues.

646
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:56,780
Scott: and magnets heal question mark.

647
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,107
Scott: Do you hear there's actually a really sad story recently?

648
00:40:59,508 --> 00:41:02,217
Rym: Let me guess someone had a disease and they use.

649
00:41:02,277 --> 00:41:04,705
Scott: no no This is that you ready.

650
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:05,969
Scott: You want to hear the sad story.

651
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,535
Rym: someone ate some neodymium magnets.

652
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:11,491
Scott: No, it's related to the Autism, you know and vaccine.

653
00:41:11,592 --> 00:41:12,938
Rym: someone didn't get a vaccine.

654
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,184
Scott: No It's even worse.

655
00:41:15,324 --> 00:41:15,907
Scott: you ready for this.

656
00:41:16,228 --> 00:41:17,493
Rym: I don't know if I want to hear this.

657
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:19,909
Scott: Well say if you want to or not Yeah, let's hear it.

658
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,000
Scott: Okay, so there's a lady.

659
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:23,200
Scott: She had a daughter who was autistic.

660
00:41:23,783 --> 00:41:26,560
Scott: Right, or I think it was a daughter a child who was autistic.

661
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:29,619
Scott: I don't remember all the details, but I remember enough the important part.

662
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:33,472
Scott: She killed her own child.

663
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,740
Scott: Whoa, because she couldn't deal with the autism.

664
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:38,720
Scott: She said she loved her kid, but she hated the autism, right?

665
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:40,376
Scott: Why did she do it?

666
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:49,419
Scott: She blamed the autism on herself for getting the kid vaccinated and she was because she'd been convinced the vaccines is what caused it.

667
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:50,784
Rym: Wow

668
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,321
Scott: Yeah,

669
00:41:53,025 --> 00:42:12,120
Rym: you know, I think I use this as news a while ago But I can't let everyone forget that the origin of the whole autism caused by vaccines bullshit was basically from a group of lawyers and doctors who colluded to make this happen in order to Generate lawsuits to make a whole bunch of money.

670
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,595
Scott: Yeah, it does sound like the conspiracy theory when we heard the way room said it just now.

671
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:17,624
Scott: but at the same time don't take Grim's word for it.

672
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:20,739
Scott: take the doctor's word for it at science-based medicine org.

673
00:42:21,342 --> 00:42:23,475
Scott: Subscribe to this feed and read it.

674
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:29,055
Scott: every article they write the newest one is on the nature of alternative medicine cancer cure testimonials.

675
00:42:29,456 --> 00:42:39,448
Scott: and it's really good because Towards the e first he talks about all that, you know, why people why there are these, you know, positive Testimonials for these fake cancer cures.

676
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:42,739
Scott: and he talks about people who have you know had you know?

677
00:42:43,543 --> 00:42:46,980
Scott: And it's really interesting it's tough it's it's pretty crazy.

678
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:50,417
Scott: And then he like this one paragraph because this guy he's the.

679
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:55,335
Scott: you know He's the guy who's the breast cancer surgical oncologist who is the specialist in breast cancer.

680
00:42:55,736 --> 00:42:56,840
Scott: and his one paragraph?

681
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,600
Scott: He just goes full-on with the science and it's just like whoa, but there's no arguing against that.

682
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,897
Scott: I mean hold on with the side not by me anyway, I just pull on with the science.

683
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:10,942
Scott: Whoa I Can really.

684
00:43:10,982 --> 00:43:16,940
Scott: I could try to find that paragraph and read it but it is way sciency like god damn is it sciency?

685
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,929
Rym: So, uh, it is a Monday night.

686
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,337
Rym: What Scott are we gonna talk about?

687
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:22,383
Scott: Can it?

688
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:22,975
Scott: Oh, okay.

689
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:25,003
Scott: Well All right.

690
00:43:25,043 --> 00:43:27,393
Scott: Well, you know the Mac world is tomorrow, right?

691
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:31,025
Scott: I do right and The Mac world is tomorrow.

692
00:43:31,406 --> 00:43:45,453
Scott: and but last week at CES Mac announced an upgrade to the Mac Pro and the Mac Pro if you Know is sort of the Mac Tower, you know They make the iMac is the desktop These the MacBook Pro and the MacBook which are the laptops and does the Mac

693
00:43:45,553 --> 00:43:45,914
Rym: Pro?

694
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:51,750
Rym: the Mac Pro is the I do 3d Editing design right house and up until last week.

695
00:43:52,372 --> 00:43:55,500
Scott: I had always you know, just the Mac Pro was not on my radar.

696
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:57,680
Scott: I mean, I knew it existed, but I didn't care about it.

697
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:07,556
Scott: I assumed maybe if I was a 3d person a graphic designer something like that The Mac Pro would be great for me Scott Rubin Mac Pro pretty useless.

698
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:08,458
Scott: I can ignore that.

699
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:18,547
Scott: right however, they announced that Mac Pro last week, so I saw the news about it and I took a look at it and Suddenly my mind started to shift.

700
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:26,680
Scott: I don't know and he I wrote a whole big thing in my blog about why I've been talking about why on You know Friday night party line and a whole bunch of other places.

701
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:51,592
Scott: I'm not gonna go into it But the one key factor in The reason that the Mac Pro was suddenly a consideration and not just a complete ignoring was that VMware Fusion existed and supposedly VMware Fusion would have allowed me to run and I guess it does allow me to run Windows and Linux and all that business alongside OS X without rebooting.

702
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:59,179
Scott: so in my mind Theoretically if the VMware Fusion worked as advertised which it doesn't is you can't play portal on it, right?

703
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:15,840
Scott: But If it works as advertised which it may one day it may one day do I could play my steam games run my Linux to do my real work and run Mac OS and Sync my iPod to iTunes and use adium and use Firefox.

704
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:20,340
Rym: Oh, man, adium that that alone is like the main reason I want to get a Mac laptop.

705
00:45:20,561 --> 00:45:22,873
Scott: Yeah, adium is like a thousand times better than any.

706
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:23,838
Scott: I am client for anything.

707
00:45:23,878 --> 00:45:37,700
Scott: But anyway Yes, so I could have done all that on one machine without having to reboot ever and I could have still had the option of rebooting in case the VMware Fusion didn't work to Windows, you know to play a game or something.

708
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:44,479
Scott: So the Mac Pro because of the VMware Fusion was possibly able to do those things and it was really appealing to me.

709
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:48,060
Scott: now You might be like hey, how does the VMware Fusion do that?

710
00:45:48,883 --> 00:45:54,071
Scott: And that is the topic of tonight's show and not just VMware but virtualization in general.

711
00:45:54,092 --> 00:46:05,261
Rym: now you a lot of people probably don't fully understand what things like VMware or virtualization do and a lot of what I want to talk about tonight is not so much how it works because you probably don't Care

712
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:06,004
Scott: but the difference

713
00:46:06,425 --> 00:46:10,580
Rym: but the difference and then mostly why this is a big deal and why this is important?

714
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,944
Scott: Why what you use it for.

715
00:46:12,264 --> 00:46:18,100
Rym: not just you but corporations and large entities have a very very big piece of this pie.

716
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:30,775
Scott: Yep, as I'll get to and there are a lot of ancillary issues related to virtualization such as virtualization and security and virtualization and you know We and efficiency and performance and we're not going to talk about those.

717
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:32,020
Scott: But yeah, let me start out.

718
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:38,088
Scott: I want to talk about the difference between a Virtual machine an emulator and wine because wine is neither.

719
00:46:38,169 --> 00:46:41,597
Scott: wine is not an emulator nor is it a virtual machine.

720
00:46:41,797 --> 00:46:42,700
Rym: wine is an API.

721
00:46:43,362 --> 00:46:46,900
Scott: Anyway, yes, so let's talk about wine is first just quickly, right?

722
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,602
Rym: What wine is is is something that will never work on any program you want it to work on but it works Just fine.

723
00:46:52,622 --> 00:46:54,430
Scott: anything you don't care actually works really well.

724
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:56,057
Scott: now met better than it ever has.

725
00:46:56,077 --> 00:46:56,720
Rym: Yeah, it does.

726
00:46:57,821 --> 00:47:03,802
Rym: I'll say this before we get going if you have used wine before you gave up because it sucked it did suck and you're not Don't.

727
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:04,986
Rym: you did suck don't forget.

728
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:06,412
Rym: I'm not gonna pretend it didn't suck.

729
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:09,445
Rym: It sucks so much less I think a lot of you.

730
00:47:09,706 --> 00:47:11,375
Scott: just on a side note God tangents.

731
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:12,199
Scott: Ahoy, right?

732
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:25,749
Scott: Is that a lot of people, you know, they use Linux at some point or they use Linux application at some point and it's a bad experience and I can see why in many cases and then they know they assume that Experience hasn't changed that experience of Linux.

733
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:26,892
Scott: things changes daily.

734
00:47:26,952 --> 00:47:27,694
Scott: It's open source.

735
00:47:27,714 --> 00:47:29,900
Scott: There's people developing it constantly, you know.

736
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,820
Scott: So there's new versions of wine every week it then there's drastic improvements every week.

737
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,323
Scott: So you can't.

738
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:43,138
Scott: that's that's part of the thing that makes Linux great in general and open source Great, is that even if you had a bad experience with it, you had to come back and try it again.

739
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:43,660
Scott: It's better.

740
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:49,104
Scott: It keeps getting better constantly anyway, so Wine, what is wine?

741
00:47:49,184 --> 00:47:52,836
Scott: wine is if you want to run you have a Windows application.

742
00:47:52,856 --> 00:47:54,040
Scott: you want to run it in Linux, right?

743
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:56,105
Scott: So, how do you get it to run?

744
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:57,068
Scott: not easily?

745
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,816
Scott: You need to you know, basically now.

746
00:47:59,856 --> 00:48:00,980
Rym: Well, why doesn't it work?

747
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,849
Rym: I mean, it's a. it's a x86.

748
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:03,935
Rym: We've talked about that before.

749
00:48:03,975 --> 00:48:04,960
Rym: it's the same hardware.

750
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:10,540
Scott: Yep, the all the x86 instructions know how to talk to your Pentium chip or whatever your Intel chip.

751
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:17,220
Rym: Very likely you wrote a program that Uses some of the shit that Windows does for you.

752
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:18,026
Scott: So yeah, like it.

753
00:48:18,046 --> 00:48:20,361
Scott: maybe it may be in the program They wrote.

754
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:30,720
Scott: they use the the code that makes the windows printing dialog show up or the windows file open dialog Or I just want to pop up a window and then I want to use like the windows graphic thing.

755
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,791
Rym: Well, you access those via an API and you know what.

756
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:36,239
Rym: Windows and Linux do not have the same API.

757
00:48:36,862 --> 00:48:40,620
Scott: It's using all sorts of libraries which are basically a bunch of tools.

758
00:48:40,941 --> 00:48:44,760
Scott: So you don't have to like I don't have to when I write a program that what makes a bunch of windows open up.

759
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:48,620
Scott: I don't have to write code to describe how windows work anymore.

760
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,799
Scott: I just say new window and windows already has the code to make windows show up.

761
00:48:53,241 --> 00:48:58,300
Scott: But Linux has code to make windows show up, but it's a different code for making Linux windows.

762
00:48:58,842 --> 00:49:03,617
Scott: So what they do is wine is a bunch is they basically from scratch?

763
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:12,200
Scott: wrote Libraries that are basically Functionally equivalent to the windows libraries, but they work in Linux and other operating systems.

764
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:18,139
Scott: So a Windows program when it would normally say hey windows open up a window wine says, huh?

765
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:19,480
Scott: He wants to open up a window.

766
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:24,800
Scott: Well, I have a library that knows how to do that and it basically is just replacing all those libraries, right?

767
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,044
Scott: It's not an emulator.

768
00:49:26,124 --> 00:49:27,108
Scott: It's not a virtual machine.

769
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:27,770
Rym: It works.

770
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,720
Rym: Okay, there's performance hits whatever but we're not talking about that any further.

771
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:38,120
Scott: It's just a different set of libraries that were made from scratch that you're trying to copy the windows libraries that windows applications work.

772
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:39,026
Scott: Okay, so an emulator.

773
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:41,200
Scott: What is an emulator?

774
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,529
Scott: Well an emulator Very simply if room gets us, right?

775
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,480
Rym: All it does is like say I've got there's the good example.

776
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,403
Rym: You can all understand.

777
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:52,169
Rym: I got ROMs, right?

778
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:52,651
Scott: Yep.

779
00:49:52,952 --> 00:50:04,999
Rym: So let's say I used to have a Nintendo Entertainment System which is a piece of hardware and I used to play games on that which were also little pieces of hardware little chips and I don't have my Nintendo anymore, but I still want to play these games.

780
00:50:05,433 --> 00:50:26,919
Rym: well I download an emulator like nesticle which basically recreates the Stuff that the hardware did and then I download a ROM which is basically an image of the hardware in the cartridge And I combine the two and it pretends to be a Nintendo Pretending to run that cartridge and I get to play the same game that I played on my NES back in the day.

781
00:50:27,642 --> 00:50:31,473
Scott: Yep, basically what it does is it's it's sort of like a trend.

782
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:33,680
Scott: most emulators at least are translators.

783
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:37,300
Scott: You know you you want to run this Nintendo ROM, right?

784
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:43,340
Scott: So you need something to translate from Nintendo ROM language into personal computer language, right?

785
00:50:43,801 --> 00:50:45,879
Scott: And the emulator will just sort of do that.

786
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,341
Scott: you know.

787
00:50:46,481 --> 00:50:48,808
Scott: it looks at what the Nintendo cartridge wants to do.

788
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:57,412
Scott: it translates that into computer speak and it does it and then you're Computer understands it and then he goes back and it tells the NES ROM.

789
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:00,360
Scott: so it's basically translating between two different languages.

790
00:51:00,462 --> 00:51:06,920
Scott: That's why it allows you to run Software say for a way different kind of computer on a way other different kind of computer.

791
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,850
Scott: It's you know, that's why you were able to run like, you know PlayStation 1 games on the Dreamcast with bleem You know stuff like that.

792
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:13,760
Scott: It's a translator.

793
00:51:15,023 --> 00:51:16,378
Scott: Now virtual machine.

794
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:19,698
Scott: Virtual machine is what we're talking about today.

795
00:51:20,482 --> 00:51:22,488
Scott: Virtual machine is exactly what it sounds like.

796
00:51:22,989 --> 00:51:24,453
Scott: It's a fake machine.

797
00:51:25,075 --> 00:51:26,600
Scott: I mean your computer is a machine, right?

798
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,182
Rym: Oh, yeah It's just.

799
00:51:28,202 --> 00:51:33,279
Rym: you know binary bits running around in a processor being added to each other a whole bunch of times.

800
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,212
Scott: now What if I wanted to make a fake machine?

801
00:51:36,252 --> 00:51:38,080
Scott: How do I do that with cardboard styrofoam?

802
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,870
Rym: Yes, that is exactly what virtual machines are.

803
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,380
Rym: They're little pieces of cardboard that you stick in your CD-ROM drive.

804
00:51:43,461 --> 00:51:44,199
Scott: Oh, then why are they useful?

805
00:51:46,025 --> 00:52:03,292
Scott: Now a virtual machine is basically instead of just making a translator from you know One kind of computer to another or redoing some libraries what they do is they write a bunch of code They make a program and the program itself Does the same thing the machine would do.

806
00:52:03,312 --> 00:52:06,000
Scott: so you look at a penny an Intel chip, right?

807
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:09,337
Scott: And that it that x86 processor does certain things.

808
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:13,874
Scott: it takes x86 assembly instructions and it processes that.

809
00:52:13,914 --> 00:52:19,572
Scott: you know, it takes those instructions It does those instructions are supposed to do and it outputs right?

810
00:52:20,515 --> 00:52:23,284
Scott: I could write a piece of software Not a chip.

811
00:52:23,364 --> 00:52:36,178
Scott: I could write a piece of software in code that can take x86 assembly instructions Figure out what they do, you know calculate what the output would be based on that input and then output that output.

812
00:52:36,499 --> 00:52:38,479
Scott: you can Recreate a machine.

813
00:52:39,062 --> 00:52:42,854
Scott: They say you can make in software a program that does the same thing.

814
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:45,340
Scott: the actual chip does You know?

815
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:53,085
Scott: I write a program in C and that program is exactly the same thing that a 486. does I Effectively have a 486?

816
00:52:53,085 --> 00:52:57,663
Scott: if I go and get a program that will run on a 486 I can just run.

817
00:52:57,703 --> 00:53:01,112
Scott: I can just give that program to the piece of software.

818
00:53:01,173 --> 00:53:02,316
Scott: I wrote that is a 486 and it'll run.

819
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:10,100
Scott: so VMware and All these other virtual machine things VMware just being a very popular one.

820
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:14,594
Scott: There's also parallels and I guess bots and a whole bunch of other ones.

821
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:16,662
Rym: Well, you can use Plex 86.

822
00:53:16,662 --> 00:53:17,629
Scott: No, yeah, there's another one.

823
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:19,219
Scott: There's a whole bunch of these things, right?

824
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:29,827
Scott: and what they do is I have a big computer and I run a virtual machine and that virtual machine basically makes a computer.

825
00:53:29,847 --> 00:53:36,862
Scott: on That computer it runs a program and that program itself is effectively a Computer.

826
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:40,521
Rym: All right, let's cut to the chase now because I'm sure people are getting real bored real quick They are.

827
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:47,924
Rym: all that means is I can have a bunch of windows on my computer that each one of them is running a Whole operating system.

828
00:53:48,245 --> 00:54:05,377
Rym: Yep, and I actually do this at work a lot at my in my office at work on my computer I have VMware workstation and in that VMware workstation I have like four different Ubuntu servers each one running different stuff and Whenever I want to do development or play with stuff or test anything I do it there.

829
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:11,927
Rym: that way I have this whole server environment that I can test on do whatever I want if I screw it up I just reload it from the default.

830
00:54:12,409 --> 00:54:19,239
Rym: if I want to like say I want to make a cluster I make one then I clone it four times open all four change the names connect them all to each other.

831
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:27,846
Scott: Yep, you basically with only one physical computer can have as many computers that are effectively more.

832
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:35,431
Scott: it's it's like having a whole bunch of computers except you only have one and you can have as Many as you can get until you run out of memory or CPU.

833
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:47,960
Scott: and if that's why the Mac Pro is so appealing Because it had it would have eight cores and I'd probably get four gigs of RAM Thus allowing me to have plenty of Linux and Windows virtual machines and thus the fact that it was Mac OS X wouldn't bog me down.

834
00:54:50,064 --> 00:54:52,439
Scott: So what are virtual machines useful for?

835
00:54:53,162 --> 00:55:06,340
Rym: Well for the industry side of it one big thing that we were using them for a lot and I I've done this at other Jobs is basically say you got a whole bunch of old servers or old old old software that only runs on like OS 2 or something.

836
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:12,240
Scott: Keep an old shitty computer around that's running OS 2 that could break at any minute because it's an old shitty computer.

837
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,387
Rym: You can't install OS 2 on a new computer.

838
00:55:14,427 --> 00:55:15,792
Scott: No, that's not gonna work.

839
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:18,200
Rym: So what if I build one?

840
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:25,560
Rym: Really really powerful server running Linux and on that Linux I run a hundred virtual machines.

841
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:31,900
Rym: Each one of them is an old OS 2 and each one of them is running one of those old applications from back in the day.

842
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:39,240
Scott: Yep I don't need to keep around my old shitty computers that could break down at any minute and probably use too much electricity And have parts that can't be fixed or replaced.

843
00:55:39,523 --> 00:55:50,408
Scott: I can have a fancy new computer but all my old shitty software can run on these fake OS twos and the software doesn't know any better because as far as Disconcerned it's this just a program.

844
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:54,543
Scott: That is the same thing as the machine that old shitty machine We threw out.

845
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:57,315
Scott: but that program is new and fancy and updated.

846
00:55:57,376 --> 00:55:58,903
Scott: So it's okay Yep.

847
00:55:59,003 --> 00:56:04,524
Rym: Now beyond that for system administration if you're virtualizing things Downtime isn't an issue.

848
00:56:04,564 --> 00:56:05,647
Rym: You want to test something.

849
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:10,080
Rym: you want to test to change you just clone your virtual machine in the current state.

850
00:56:10,865 --> 00:56:18,300
Rym: Run it in a net like just run it Make your change see if it works and if it works just do the same thing to your working server.

851
00:56:18,746 --> 00:56:30,660
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you know Not only because not only do you have something that effectively works the exact same way as a real machine But it's not a real machine, but it has all the advantages of being a piece of software.

852
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,524
Scott: You can copy it.

853
00:56:31,744 --> 00:56:33,652
Scott: You can pass it around you can buck with it.

854
00:56:33,853 --> 00:56:34,536
Scott: You can pause it.

855
00:56:34,717 --> 00:56:42,800
Rym: You can start it I can rewind it you can fast-forward it I can make a machine to test something and then send it to Scott so he can test the thing I made.

856
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:48,540
Scott: Yeah, and it'd be exactly the same thing because we're using the same fake machine even though our real machines are different.

857
00:56:49,562 --> 00:56:51,732
Scott: Another thing like our hosting is a good example.

858
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:53,220
Scott: our hosting is Linux, right?

859
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,926
Scott: But it runs on user mode Linux.

860
00:56:55,006 --> 00:56:58,660
Scott: user mode Linux is a little different from virtual machine, but it's pretty close.

861
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:01,309
Scott: it's effectively the same as far as few people are concerned.

862
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:11,340
Scott: and what it is user mode Linux is where you have a Linux kernel running on a computer and then you load a bunch of other Linux kernels.

863
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:15,474
Scott: So it splits up one big computer into a bunch of little computers.

864
00:57:15,514 --> 00:57:24,660
Scott: so as far as I'm concerned right sitting in my house our compute our hosting our web hosting is On a dedicated Linux server.

865
00:57:25,102 --> 00:57:36,647
Scott: It's as if I could not tell the difference if I didn't between what we have and if I had my very own Linux computer with a real its own CPU and its own RAM and its Own everything, but I don't.

866
00:57:36,928 --> 00:57:39,500
Scott: there's one big server with a bunch of Linux is on it.

867
00:57:39,921 --> 00:57:48,000
Scott: But I just log in to some machine as you know me and I log into it normally and I have full control over this Machine, it's just not a real machine.

868
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:53,494
Scott: It's a part of a bigger machine just running another copy of Linux within a copy of Linux.

869
00:57:53,915 --> 00:58:01,299
Rym: now the ramifications for you Small time developer hobbyist whatever is say you want to play around with a bunch of different Linux's.

870
00:58:01,821 --> 00:58:04,295
Rym: Well, just make virtual machines and play all you want.

871
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,220
Rym: You don't even have to reboot.

872
00:58:05,665 --> 00:58:15,479
Rym: Yeah, and if you mess something up Oh, well If you would need to look up documentation because your gen 2 stage 1 isn't working so well Your gen 2 stage 1 is in a window and you've got a Firefox open next to it.

873
00:58:15,902 --> 00:58:17,352
Scott: Yep, I mean you can.

874
00:58:17,392 --> 00:58:21,116
Scott: you don't have to go rebooting You don't have to mess with your partitions or anything if you want to.

875
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:21,619
Scott: you know.

876
00:58:22,004 --> 00:58:23,360
Scott: You say you want to make a Linux, right?

877
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,707
Scott: So you make a 10 gigabyte file.

878
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,340
Scott: you install the Linux onto that 10 gigabyte file, right?

879
00:58:29,521 --> 00:58:33,042
Scott: If you don't like it, you can delete the file and you're all good It'll.

880
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:37,949
Scott: actually the file won't even grow to be 10 gigs unless you fill the 10 gigs, you know And you can have you.

881
00:58:38,354 --> 00:58:49,344
Scott: you know If you need to use like a Windows application and you're running OS X the VMware Fusion It'll just you have Windows running inside of a window You literally.

882
00:58:49,364 --> 00:58:55,147
Scott: you'll have your Apple Doc and then there'll be a window and in that window will be Microsoft Windows.

883
00:58:55,489 --> 00:59:00,314
Scott: and as far as that Windows is concerned It's running on a real computer all on its own.

884
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:03,487
Scott: It has no idea now it doesn't know that Mac OS X is out there.

885
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:26,453
Rym: the holy grail of all this that we have not achieved yet is to the point where I can run whatever operating system I want or even maybe a base generic operating system that doesn't do anything by itself and only hosts virtual machines and Then I run whatever operating systems I want for whatever applications I want and thus it doesn't matter What kind of computer I have doesn't matter what operating system I have.

886
00:59:26,473 --> 00:59:27,920
Rym: I can do whatever I want without rebooting.

887
00:59:28,103 --> 00:59:29,179
Scott: Yeah, we're pretty close to that.

888
00:59:29,401 --> 00:59:33,820
Rym: The problem is Steam really doesn't work in a virtual machine worth a damn.

889
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:37,860
Scott: Yeah, because here's here's the problem right when you make a virtual machine, right?

890
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:55,740
Scott: Basically, what you're doing is you're not just doing the CPU you're doing the sound card and the video card and you're basically they're writing a piece of software and When the windows that runs in the virtual machine says draw a polygon on the screen They write not just you know, the windows uses its own driver, right?

891
00:59:56,141 --> 01:00:01,220
Scott: But that driver isn't, you know sending its instructions to your actual video card.

892
01:00:01,521 --> 01:00:05,260
Scott: It's sending instructions to this program that's pretending to be a video card.

893
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:15,076
Scott: So unless that program pretending to be a video card is as good as an Nvidia video card It's gonna be really hard to play a game on it.

894
01:00:15,539 --> 01:00:18,380
Scott: So Until you know, it's getting better.

895
01:00:18,545 --> 01:00:34,109
Scott: I mean They're at the point where some 3d stuff is kind of working and such but not really and it's gonna take a while for The program that is pretending to be a video card to be as good as an actual video card and it when you get to That point then 3d stuff will really start to kick ass.

896
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:37,900
Rym: now probably the biggest thing but we've already gone on a long time.

897
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,662
Rym: So I think we'll talk about this in a separate show because there's a whole World.

898
01:00:41,703 --> 01:00:50,360
Rym: I can talk about what this is and why it's important whatever but for now I would recommend that anyone out there who doesn't know about this already go download VMware player because it's free

899
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:50,841
Scott: Yep,

900
01:00:50,921 --> 01:00:57,399
Rym: really free and then just search on the VMware site for virtual appliances and look at what they are.

901
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:00,559
Rym: Download any that look interesting run them and play with them.

902
01:01:00,852 --> 01:01:08,073
Scott: Yeah They're also how-to guides as to like how to you know Make your own virtual appliances with a text editor and QEM.

903
01:01:08,094 --> 01:01:14,320
Scott: you and you know Linux CD And you don't even need to burn the CDs just need to download ISO's of Linux distributions.

904
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:20,100
Scott: You could play with every Linux distribution in the universe without ever actually having to format your hard drive or anything.

905
01:01:20,922 --> 01:01:23,860
Scott: You can just fool around with all of them and see what they do and see what they're like.

906
01:01:24,203 --> 01:01:30,920
Rym: And if you're interested someday in the future We could probably talk about virtual appliances themselves and the many myriad of uses that they have.

907
01:01:31,024 --> 01:01:31,131
Rym: Yep

908
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:44,080
Scott: Now the one more thing one thing I do want to say one very good use of virtual machine is if you're a web developer Right, you're making web pages and you want to make sure those web pages look good No matter what browser no matter what operating system, right?

909
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,920
Scott: Well, it's kind of hard to install ie6 and seven on the same machine, even though it's kind of possible.

910
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:49,644
Scott: it's it's kind of.

911
01:01:49,684 --> 01:01:52,239
Scott: it's not easy right and it's not perfect.

912
01:01:52,259 --> 01:01:59,534
Scott: and You can you know, what if you need to test Safari on Mac and then they have Safari for Windows now and they have opera on Windows Mac and Linux?

913
01:01:59,575 --> 01:02:05,300
Scott: and you know, You have Conqueror and KDE you have different Firefox versions and you you don't want to get them all confused.

914
01:02:05,386 --> 01:02:17,651
Scott: well just make a bunch of virtual machines for it with a. Each one has a different set of browsers that don't conflict with each other and then you can test your website and all these different Browsers, but you're really only sitting at one computer.

915
01:02:17,671 --> 01:02:19,620
Scott: You have to have a bunch of computers or anything like that.

916
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:24,580
Scott: You just one computer and you can test all these browsers and all these different operating systems to see how stuff works.

917
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:37,399
Scott: Also, if you're just programming a program Let's say I want to write a word processor program and I want that word processor program to work on every operating system And I know I've coded it right for every operating system, but I got to test it.

918
01:02:38,123 --> 01:02:44,616
Scott: Well instead of having a computer, you know five computers I can just use one and that is the amazingness.

919
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:45,580
Scott: That is the virtual machine.

920
01:02:52,132 --> 01:02:54,739
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

921
01:02:54,759 --> 01:02:56,924
