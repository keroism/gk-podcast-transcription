1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,102
Rym: It's Monday February 25th 2008.

2
00:00:13,102 --> 00:00:15,810
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,770
Rym: We are back from a bone itis induced hiatus and we're here to talk about computer literacy.

4
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:25,817
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,952
Rym: well There comes GeekNights for the first time in a while.

6
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:34,637
Scott: We should just quit the show.

7
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:35,860
Rym: You know, it's weird.

8
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:42,980
Rym: I thought man if I don't do the show for a week And this is already a crazy preposition what not doing the show for a week and you're not going anywhere?

9
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:46,190
Rym: I thought all right not doing the show for a week.

10
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:51,980
Rym: I'm going to accomplish pretty much every non GeekNights goal I've had in my life combined accomplished nothing.

11
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:54,411
Rym: I think part of that was that we're not.

12
00:00:54,612 --> 00:01:03,450
Rym: you might hear some coughing Throughout this show because you see the reason there were no shows last night had nothing to do With us being tired from Katsu.

13
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,420
Scott: Come know it had to do with our bone itis.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,538
Rym: In fact, we were actually prepared and planning to do a special on Monday and then continue on Tuesday.

15
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:12,300
Rym: business as usual.

16
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:15,131
Rym: But we're not gonna tell the whole story now.

17
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:15,492
Rym: this might.

18
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:19,889
Rym: this story might be a Thursday fodder But suffice to say I'm gonna say that a lot.

19
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,275
Rym: I haven't said it in a long time.

20
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:29,753
Scott: Stop saying it Suffice to say, you know, you say suffice to say a lot, you know, you know, yeah some preenie.

21
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:33,927
Rym: so, uh Thursday at the con everything's going great.

22
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,794
Rym: Friday Scott's feeling a little crappy.

23
00:01:35,814 --> 00:01:41,117
Rym: I was feel a little crappy Thursday yeah, but you were like, oh you're still kind of okay Friday for a while.

24
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:45,411
Rym: and then Scott got sick with what I can only assume was bone itis.

25
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:51,849
Rym: It was definitely bone itis and I'm thinking all right all I got to do is not make out with him or anything not too hard.

26
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,880
Scott: and Yeah, you know bone itis, you know how it transfers.

27
00:01:56,322 --> 00:02:02,009
Rym: Yeah, despite the fact that you know, we're doing a bunch of events together in a dry ass hotel Tired.

28
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:05,003
Scott: it was so dry All weekend.

29
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:06,127
Scott: Oh so dry.

30
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:08,856
Rym: Yeah, that was some of the driest drive ever had to drive.

31
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,039
Scott: There was no water.

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,400
Scott: I mean, usually I'm not one to complain about like humidity, but goddamn was it fucking dry.

33
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,271
Rym: It was dry enough to where even when I wasn't sick.

34
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:25,628
Rym: I woke up with a nosebleed like ah But it's alright Friday Saturday, I'm doing okay.

35
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,913
Rym: Scott's super sick.

36
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,820
Rym: I lost my voice because then Scott was sick.

37
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,331
Scott: I barely like even did anything at the con.

38
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,195
Scott: I was so sick.

39
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:33,260
Scott: I'm looking back.

40
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:37,794
Scott: All I remember really is like the hotel room the events we ran.

41
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:42,349
Scott: I went to the dealers room once I was in the video game room for a little bit.

42
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:43,573
Scott: That was it.

43
00:02:44,235 --> 00:02:45,660
Rym: Yeah, it was a sad sight.

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:58,976
Rym: I'd like go off to do like take care of all the business that Scott couldn't take care of and I'd come back to video Game room and I'd see our Atari and behind it at the table I'd see Scott kind of huddled over like holding his arms close to his chest.

45
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:00,060
Rym: He looked half dead.

46
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:01,706
Scott: I was mostly dead.

47
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:02,770
Rym: Our listeners would come over.

48
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,553
Rym: They're like Scott.

49
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:04,396
Rym: Are you okay?

50
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:05,621
Scott: You know bone itis It's.

51
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:07,205
Scott: it's a dangerous disease.

52
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:10,476
Scott: So, uh bone itis awareness, you know, we gotta march for bone itis.

53
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:11,138
Rym: I think we do.

54
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:15,439
Rym: Yeah My only regret is having not cured my bone itis.

55
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:18,767
Rym: so, uh Sunday rolls around.

56
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:27,402
Rym: I wake up feeling a little bad I mean, but thing is I actually lost my voice because I had to kind of make up for the slack of Scott not yelling At people.

57
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:28,646
Rym: so I had to yell twice as much.

58
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:37,134
Rym: but it got worse and it got worse and drinks in the bar Certainly didn't make me feel better like they usually do a convention on Sunday.

59
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:47,438
Rym: So, uh, oh So we go to the staff party at the Hard Rock Cafe and I remember precisely 25 minutes and change into the party.

60
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:57,280
Rym: I realized I have to be here for two and a half more hours and I just realized that I feel perhaps the the third or fourth worst I've ever felt in my life.

61
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:01,391
Scott: Yeah That party was way too long for people that really didn't.

62
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:11,940
Rym: I wanted to be there because we missed it last year But I was so sick I passed out at the table and we couldn't leave because either wait for the shuttle bus to take us back.

63
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,130
Rym: Plus the worst thing is I feel like shit.

64
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:17,959
Rym: so and Pete and Scott are not feeling too great either.

65
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:24,328
Rym: I'll point out that everyone in the front row crew Except Emily have gotten sick with this.

66
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,593
Scott: I check this out though.

67
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:27,379
Scott: the doctor me ninja guy, right?

68
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,489
Scott: Well, I did not see him at the con.

69
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:30,052
Scott: He was there.

70
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:31,400
Scott: I did not see him at all.

71
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,608
Scott: I didn't even I barely even remember that he was there.

72
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:36,720
Scott: I did not see him or speak to him or anything.

73
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,270
Scott: He said he got sick on his website at the con.

74
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,751
Rym: there would the.

75
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:43,140
Rym: the thing is there might have been multiple.

76
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,879
Rym: Bonita's is going through cops.

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,944
Rym: There's no way to know

78
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,930
Scott: just how much Bonita's is going around

79
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:59,579
Rym: because I think I think the the real factor here is not so much The Scott was sick and gave it to all the front row crew But it was that it was so dry because you know Bonita's spreads in dryness more so than in any other ness

80
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:02,868
Scott: Mmm, and I don't more so than Loch Ness.

81
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:03,630
Scott: I don't know.

82
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:11,150
Rym: I don't think you understand how motherfucking dry it was Not just in this convention, but in Washington DC from Thursday through Monday.

83
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:14,453
Scott: The humidity must have been like negative a billion.

84
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:21,467
Rym: Yeah, God felt like I was in Arrakis, but Yeah, everyone at the con got sick.

85
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:25,400
Rym: pretty much everyone the staff in all got sick from what I hear.

86
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:31,953
Scott: But it seemed like most people were sick towards the end or after the con and not during Except Scott who was sick during most of the con.

87
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:34,008
Rym: I felt really bad Emily.

88
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:38,485
Rym: I felt I felt pretty bad And brought him some soup and she came down.

89
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:45,269
Rym: She's like, I think Scott's not gonna make it He's mumbling to himself about something.

90
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,603
Scott: I bought a room service chicken soup, right Scott Wait, wait, wait.

91
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:50,307
Rym: now think about this.

92
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:52,519
Rym: Scott bought a room service.

93
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:56,820
Rym: now It was like $15 about a $15 chicken soup and an orange juice.

94
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,084
Scott: The orange juice is like 60 now.

95
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:02,560
Rym: wasn't the like dollar 50 microwave Campbell's soup that Emily bought you better?

96
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:03,909
Scott: It was far as a barrier.

97
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:05,360
Rym: Yeah, don't ever get room sir.

98
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,940
Scott: Luckily, I was staffed so I could have access to the microwave in the con suite.

99
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:12,776
Scott: Yeah, while I was in there some staffer like poured hot coffee all over his hand.

100
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:13,559
Scott: That was those.

101
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:15,703
Scott: That's like.

102
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:16,789
Scott: I felt really bad for him.

103
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:22,839
Scott: I didn't say anything cuz I was really sick Yeah, and I'm like, oh, well, it's he's still better off than me.

104
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:24,524
Rym: What a con.

105
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:27,818
Rym: so, uh, yeah, we were brought low by this disease.

106
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:31,580
Rym: as a result We missed a whole week of GeekNights, you know art because of our bones.

107
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:35,620
Rym: Yeah, the worst thing is there was a lot of fucking news last week.

108
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,433
Rym: I had so much stuff for every day, but I couldn't talk.

109
00:06:39,473 --> 00:06:40,316
Rym: I couldn't even get out of bed.

110
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:41,340
Rym: I missed two days of work.

111
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,816
Scott: Yeah, I didn't go to work Monday, of course because I was off for katsu come.

112
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:45,740
Scott: I didn't go to work Tuesday.

113
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:47,509
Rym: I didn't go to work Tuesday or Wednesday.

114
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:49,278
Scott: I didn't do anything at work Wednesday, right?

115
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:57,500
Rym: I staggered back into work on Thursday and I went home at the end of the day and realized that I had accomplished basically nothing.

116
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:04,400
Rym: I sat in my desk and stared at my screen and I thought like oh man, how hardcore am I?

117
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:06,633
Rym: I'm working then at the end of the day.

118
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:10,493
Rym: I Didn't have a single goddamn thing to my name done.

119
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:12,060
Rym: I basically just sat there.

120
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,802
Scott: I'm still.

121
00:07:13,204 --> 00:07:15,753
Scott: I feel fine now, but I'm still coughing up phlegm.

122
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,660
Scott: It's been like ten days.

123
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:22,592
Scott: Yeah, no, it's a seven eight nine to eleven days.

124
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:23,956
Rym: This is the sucks.

125
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:28,789
Rym: Yeah, but Suffice to say yeah, you gotta cut that.

126
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:31,919
Rym: we're here doing GeekNights and I got some news.

127
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:33,709
Scott: It's like a GeekNights ever.

128
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:35,820
Rym: Yeah as before we die of bonitis.

129
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:47,000
Rym: I would like to say one thing for all of you who are at Katsucon and made out with Scott What you've got is probably viral bronchitis, but that aside Welcome all you new listeners.

130
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:54,440
Rym: I saw a lot of you hitting the feed after Katsucon probably going thought those guys had like four nights a week.

131
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,303
Rym: Where's the show?

132
00:07:57,086 --> 00:07:59,092
Scott: Oh, they musta Katsucon was their last hurrah.

133
00:07:59,112 --> 00:07:59,513
Scott: Yeah.

134
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:01,540
Scott: Why were they advertising there?

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,453
Rym: But yeah, I'll tell you all this and if you're looking for Katsucon coverage It is going to come to you in an epic way on Wednesday.

136
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:10,040
Rym: I got a lot to say about Katsucon.

137
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:10,744
Scott: Oh, yeah, I got.

138

Scott: I got some coverage.

139
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,520
Scott: the inside of the hotel room was real nice.

140
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,131
Rym: I can say this aside the bed was not so sick.

141
00:08:16,151 --> 00:08:18,160
Rym: That was like the best freaking Katsucon.

142
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,951
Rym: Like I. it was a great time.

143
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:24,540
Scott: Anyway, so it's Monday So my technology day is not the anime convention day.

144
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,979
Rym: So I got to talk about this because this is a company that is very near and dear to me.

145
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:34,193
Rym: I've had a long and complicated relationship with the sharper image.

146
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:42,616
Rym: now in the days before the internet Sharper image was basically a top magazine a store where you could mail order.

147
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:51,468
Rym: now book cheap crappy Shotski gimmicky bullshit, but Her image is like I didn't.

148
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,200
Scott: there weren't really any and I didn't get the catalog.

149
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,900
Scott: So I was like I was way late to the game on the sharper image.

150
00:08:57,101 --> 00:09:06,447
Rym: I was looking to these sharper image catalogs as a kid and much like when I looked at sword Catalogs or went to Brookstone all I could think was wow Everything in this man.

151
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:07,112
Scott: We definitely had.

152
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:12,352
Rym: Brookstones is Concentrated awesome because they sell crap.

153
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:22,120
Rym: It was unmitigatedly garbage But it is high-class crap if you want to spend like a thousand dollars on a little gadget that goes meat and rubs your back.

154
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,918
Rym: The sharper image was for you.

155
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:25,361
Scott: Yeah It is.

156
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:27,247
Scott: it's the same as Brookstones.

157
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:36,474
Scott: only the difference was the Brookstones and all the stuff that they sell is like wooden But all the stuff that sharper image sells is like shiny chrome.

158
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:38,260
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty much the only difference.

159
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,490
Rym: Oh also sharper image killed old people.

160
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,495
Rym: I don't think Brookstone did.

161
00:09:41,776 --> 00:09:44,690
Scott: no, that's true You know, they're still selling those old people killers.

162
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:46,660
Rym: Ah, you know, we should pick up a few.

163
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:50,314
Rym: Keep them around just in case they're not good.

164
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:51,740
Scott: They're not useful for anything.

165
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:56,055
Rym: Well, what you do is, you know, we've got someone an undesirable has come to the geek house.

166
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:57,500
Rym: All right, dude, you stay here.

167
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,579
Rym: We're all gonna go get Chinese food and bring it back.

168
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:05,432
Rym: Don't mind me turning on all these ionizing air fresheners and closing all the windows.

169
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,139
Rym: don't go anywhere for the next four days.

170
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:13,520
Rym: Yeah, yeah, they sold these ionizing air fresheners and basically air filters.

171
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:18,278
Rym: All they did was make ozone and ozone is mildly toxic.

172
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,460
Rym: Yep Yeah, that was a real great marketing idea.

173
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,585
Scott: They still sell these things.

174
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,780
Scott: if you want an air filter that's an air filter is an okay product.

175
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:28,599
Scott: It can be useful but don't buy an ionizing air fill.

176
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,847
Rym: Well, the thing is ionizing.

177
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:37,880
Rym: air filters can be not bad However, crappy ones and cheap ones and ones that claim to freshen the air usually just make ozone.

178
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:40,514
Scott: Yeah, it's just an ozone making machine and nothing else.

179
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:41,480
Scott: Anyway Sharper image.

180
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:48,018
Rym: So the Sharper image sold crap and you know I never really thought about this but in retrospect the hindsight comes in.

181
00:10:48,641 --> 00:11:02,846
Rym: The Sharper image was one of those companies that pretty much the moment you could buy crap online their days were numbered because the only servers they offered was selling things that people didn't think they could get from anywhere else at Exorbitantly marked up prices.

182
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:06,360
Rym: I mean, yeah pretty much you if you're there Soviet like night vision.

183
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,393
Rym: That was really crappy and you had 500 bucks to kill.

184
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,920
Rym: Sharper image was where you went.

185
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:21,973
Scott: You would go there in the olden days You know like in the 90s and you would see things that you didn't even know existed or things you knew existed But seemed you like futuristic soviet night vision.

186
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:23,740
Scott: You couldn't buy them at Best Buy.

187
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:32,103
Rym: Do you know how much I wanted night vision as a kid from the age of seven until I stopped making Christmas lists night vision Was number one.

188
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:40,206
Scott: it was like fancy gadgets that were not available through any other venue that you knew of, you know, but now They don't even sell fancy gadgets.

189
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:42,453
Scott: They sell completely run-of-the-mill stuff.

190
00:11:42,473 --> 00:11:44,700
Scott: that just well he has to be a fancy guy.

191
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,307
Rym: They don't sell jack anymore.

192
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:47,231
Rym: They went bankrupt.

193
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:47,934
Scott: That's true.

194
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:48,396
Rym: They did.

195
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:49,260
Rym: That's the news.

196
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,030
Rym: The Sharper image is filed for bankruptcy protection.

197
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,619
Rym: They're probably gonna go out of business.

198
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:56,848
Scott: Well, how does Brookstone stay in business?

199
00:11:56,908 --> 00:12:00,160
Rym: and Sharper image doesn't I think because Brookstone had a lot more stores.

200
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,740
Rym: Brookstone stuff was a lot cheaper and a lot of a sharper image sold.

201
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:13,494
Rym: Like didn't appeal to the kind of like the old man old woman Grandma looking for a gift for their son who has some money to burn in the mall.

202
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:18,879
Rym: Hey a back scratcher Golf tee that also barks like a dog.

203
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:23,519
Rym: Sharper image sold things that were complicated that the old people didn't understand.

204
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,732
Rym: Brookstone sells very uncomplicated things that massage you that's true.

205
00:12:28,193 --> 00:12:30,660
Rym: So, uh, yeah, they're pretty much done.

206
00:12:31,122 --> 00:12:32,166
Rym: They're gonna sell get.

207
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:35,600
Rym: they're gonna keep some of their stores open to try to sell enough stuff to pay off all their debts.

208
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,712
Rym: They owe UPS like six million dollars.

209
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:39,200
Rym: Yeah, not that UPS cares.

210
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:56,459
Scott: well, I mean if you want fancy gadgets that are futuristic and do crazy things just go to in gadget read it every day and Occasionally, they'll be like hey check out this fancy gadget, you know stuff like, you know The optimus maximus keyboard or whatever and you know you go and you buy it from wherever who makes it.

211
00:12:57,345 --> 00:12:58,920
Scott: That's that's how things go nowadays.

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,841
Scott: You don't need some sharper image to display to you the fancy future Don't?

213
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,387
Rym: I think really killed him in the end.

214
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:05,713
Rym: and why Brookstone still around?

215
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:16,054
Rym: Mm-hmm Brookstone and sharper image I think capitalized most of all on the market of people who go to Malls because they'd be there and when you went to the mall you'd walk by it and there's.

216
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:17,800
Rym: there's nothing interesting in the mall.

217
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:28,750
Rym: You're just you're there in this time warp with your family or something and geeky people would go to like natural wonder or Brookstone or sharper image because there were things to poke at.

218
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,788
Rym: that went meep and you could entertain yourself for like 10 minutes before You got on your way.

219
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,980
Rym: Yep now Geeks don't go to malls.

220
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:38,473
Rym: Geeks shop on Amazon.

221
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:39,660
Rym: They hate malls.

222
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:45,698
Rym: They don't go to malls unless they're gonna play DDR in the arcade because malls the only places that have arcades anymore.

223
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,488
Rym: Yeah So, uh, geeks don't go to malls.

224
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:54,400
Rym: sharper image markets expensive crap to semi geeky people.

225
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:59,854
Rym: Oh, well, I find this hilarious and I hope they're out in hell.

226
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:01,440
Scott: All right, so check this out, right?

227
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:06,420
Scott: So hard drive encryption is something people have been doing for a while now.

228
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:10,053
Scott: The idea of hard drive encryption right is we?

229
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:19,189
Scott: you know, if you encrypt your hard drive, obviously You know your computer needs to like read and use the data that's on your hard drive, you know to work You know like your operating system whatever.

230
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:28,458
Scott: so, you know it's encrypting the hard drive isn't like gonna prevent you from all sorts of security like worms and viruses and whatever.

231
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:32,614
Scott: because if you get a Worm or a virus is you'll just be on your hard drive encrypted.

232
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:34,180
Scott: It'll it'll still be all evil.

233
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,069
Scott: You know what hard drive encryption protects you from?

234
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:40,420
Scott: is it protects you from someone coming into your house?

235
00:14:40,941 --> 00:14:44,032
Scott: Taking your hard drive and then reading the data off.

236
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,440
Rym: So yes now not we're not talking about file encryption.

237
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:53,324
Rym: I mean I can have an encrypted directory where all my whatever it is that I'm trying to hide is in there And that's a totally different thing.

238
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,452
Scott: Yeah, we're talking about encrypting the entire hard drive.

239
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:56,636
Scott: Not just some files.

240
00:14:56,716 --> 00:14:57,820
Scott: the whole thing, right?

241
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:07,779
Scott: So the operating system everything that way they don't even know what files you have let alone, you know It's not like with file encryption to be like, oh I see a file here, but I can't read what's in it.

242
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:10,349
Scott: With hard drive encryption, it's.

243
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,380
Scott: I have no idea what's on this hard drive.

244
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:16,397
Scott: It may as well be blank, but you type in a password and you have the.

245
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:21,840
Scott: you know The decrypting software in your BIOS or whatever and now you can use the encrypted drive.

246
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:26,166
Scott: But so if someone stole your computer They wouldn't get any of your data.

247
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:30,480
Scott: if your drive is encrypted or if the police came to arrest you you turn your computer off.

248
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:32,600
Scott: Now they can't get your data, right?

249
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:43,311
Rym: Of course if you're worried if you're one of those people where oh snap the police are gonna come and take my computer one day And you're not a teenager anymore because every teenage geek thinks that often.

250
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:46,560
Rym: but it's never gonna happen unless you're doing something actually bad.

251
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:52,652
Rym: but a Better way to go about that is to use nothing but live CDs.

252
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:54,620
Rym: keep everything resident in RAM at all times.

253
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,570
Scott: Well, that's what I'm gonna talk about in a second.

254
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:56,751
Scott: See.

255
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:57,655
Rym: Oh, yeah.

256
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:13,012
Scott: Yeah Um When you encrypt your hard drive like that Right these you still need a piece of software to be running at all times that you know is constantly Decrypting and encrypting all your reads and writes to and from the drive

257
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,720
Rym: unless you get an encrypted like hardware hard drive.

258
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:18,489
Rym: I guess there are things that do that there.

259
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,131
Scott: I guess there are.

260
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:46,653
Scott: but the point is is that most of these solutions the way They work is you turn the computer on and at some point it asks you for the passphrase to unlock the keys Right, and then it loads the keys into RAM and then the software, you know reads the key in RAM and you know Reason writes to the drive, you know with within and decrypts and encrypts everything with the key That's in RAM, which is fine because if someone steals your hard drive or you turn the computer off You know that it doesn't stay in RAM.

261
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,519
Scott: They can't get your key.

262
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:58,215
Scott: They basically need your computer and your password Your passphrase to get the key loaded into RAM to get the software working and it succeeds at the Job, it's supposed to do.

263
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,095
Scott: however Some guys have discovered and this is sort of obvious if you think about it, right?

264
00:17:04,617 --> 00:17:05,440
Scott: So you got some RAM.

265
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,405
Scott: You know how RAM works?

266
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,859
Scott: Well the RAM can work in many different ways.

267
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,561
Scott: It's just memory.

268
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:14,680
Scott: that's you know random access but specifically the DRAM that's in your computer works this way.

269
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,790
Scott: It's basically a bunch of capacitors, right?

270
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:18,854
Scott: You know what a capacitor is.

271
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,220
Scott: if you don't I can't help you.

272
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,700
Rym: Yeah, I don't even know if we talked about that.

273
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,648
Rym: No, we didn't but we did a show on basic computer stuff But I think that was a little more basic than we went.

274
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,980
Scott: Yeah, RAM is a bunch of capacitors.

275
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:39,232
Scott: So if you have each capacitors one capacitor for each bit literally, so if the capacitor is charged It's a one and if it's discharged it's a zero.

276
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,240
Scott: so RAM is basically well.

277
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,306
Rym: Sometimes it's the opposite.

278
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:43,754
Rym: but don't worry about it doesn't matter.

279
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,904
Rym: specifics don't matter Don't don't don't focus.

280
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:51,420
Scott: basically your RAM is constantly charging and discharging a like a zillion capacitors.

281
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,647
Scott: You have 128 megabytes of RAM.

282
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:57,600
Rym: That's like a hundred and twenty-eight mega times eight.

283
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:12,814
Scott: That's a thousand twenty four million capacitors in a very small amount of space and they're either getting charged and discharged constantly, right okay, so You have this key in your RAM somewhere.

284
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:17,530
Scott: that is your encryption key and It's in these capacitors that are either on or off.

285
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:20,220
Scott: Okay, so you turn your computer off.

286
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:23,560
Scott: What if I spray your RAM with Freon?

287
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,007
Scott: Right or some other sort of compressed air coolant?

288
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:29,173
Scott: take the RAM out of your computer.

289
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:31,540
Scott: put it into a RAM reading thing.

290
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:34,893
Scott: Read the data out of the RAM and people had.

291
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:35,696
Scott: they just did this.

292
00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:36,680
Scott: they proved that it works.

293
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:39,180
Scott: You can get someone's encryption key.

294
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:51,600
Scott: So if I show up at your house and I'm prepared and I know your drive is encrypted and I'm you know I'm taking your computer I can with a can of compressed air and You know a machine to read the data out of your RAM.

295
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:57,800
Scott: I can get pretty much all the data out of your RAM very reliably and decrypt your drive.

296
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:03,174
Scott: so Make your RAM warm, I guess when you turn it off.

297
00:19:03,254 --> 00:19:04,560
Scott: We should have a little RAM heaters.

298
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,805
Scott: You turn your computer off.

299
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:08,859
Rym: How long after you turn your computer off is the data still there?

300
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,754
Scott: You pretty much you know, you spray it's.

301
00:19:11,955 --> 00:19:16,353
Scott: it's not that long but it's it's long enough to where it can be a threat if someone is prepared.

302
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:20,707
Rym: so basically if Mission impossible happens in your house.

303
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:23,195
Scott: It's not it's more than mission impossible.

304
00:19:23,215 --> 00:19:24,680
Scott: It's mission sort of likely.

305
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,891
Rym: How I mean I really how long did they say?

306
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:29,539
Scott: that didn't say but they did it.

307
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:32,430
Rym: I really don't believe that it's more than a few seconds.

308
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:34,378
Scott: I it might be a minute.

309
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:34,799
Scott: I don't know.

310
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,148
Scott: I didn't even that.

311
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,760
Rym: a minute is not that much of a concern.

312
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,202
Scott: It's not.

313
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:41,715
Rym: it's not very long because that means that you were still getting mission impossible.

314
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,000
Rym: Someone is coming into your house.

315
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:50,778
Scott: They're gonna go ready ready RAM free on read hard drive rod Yeah, but I mean it's not even free like they did it with a can of.

316
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:56,014
Scott: you know Air like it's kind of air you used to clean your computer You turn it upside down and now you have a our frostbite gun.

317
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,060
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

318
00:19:57,802 --> 00:20:03,737
Scott: by the way, the point is is that You know, we need to even though it's it's sort of mission impossible.

319
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:07,440
Scott: ish Well, you know what not, you know, it's not enough to satisfy security.

320
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:12,524
Rym: It illustrates a much more important point of much broader point that and and there's.

321
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:22,820
Rym: this is somewhat tangentially related, but I'm gonna Talk very briefly about the idea of the side channel that you have information that you were trying to protect or access or whatever.

322
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:37,909
Rym: There's information in a place but there is kind of this ancillary External or meta information about that or dependent upon that and a lot of times you can get information in Unanticipated ways like there was a story a long time ago about.

323
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,880
Rym: you can't do this with Ethernet but with slower old networking protocols.

324
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:44,979
Rym: You know There's that little LED that lights up whenever you're sending data.

325
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:54,038
Rym: The way those really worked back in the day was that it literally just whenever there was current going over the line It lit up and whenever there wasn't current it wasn't lit up.

326
00:20:54,761 --> 00:21:04,173
Rym: So if you filmed those light bulbs in a data center those LEDs with a high-speed camera You could recreate from that film all the data that was being sent over the line.

327
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,980
Rym: This was done experimentally several times.

328
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:14,520
Rym: Yep, that that is like a side band side channel doesn't work anymore Doesn't work on Ethernet or gigabit or anything like that, but it worked on old stuff a long time ago.

329
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,056
Scott: Yeah, that's stuff that was slow.

330
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:18,118
Scott: now The lights don't actually blink, you know.

331
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:23,215
Rym: But there's all sorts of info ways to get information that you might not anticipate.

332
00:21:23,235 --> 00:21:33,429
Rym: there are all these other channels Carrying the information that you create that if you actually are worried about security You have to pay attention to these and at least decide.

333
00:21:33,449 --> 00:21:36,940
Rym: All right, how much effort would it take to exploit the side channel?

334
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,400
Rym: How much is it worth to me to defend against such an attack?

335
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:55,039
Scott: I think what people are just gonna start doing is when their computer shuts down the shutdown sequence You know in the operating system, it's just gonna write all zero, you know, just blank out the the RAM and then turn off.

336
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:57,297
Scott: It's kind of simple.

337
00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:59,085
Rym: Well, this is more.

338
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:09,464
Rym: I think this is more the case of if someone breaks into a house or a place where there's a live Computer Yeah, and they rip the RAM out do this to it get the key and then take the hard drive I guess.

339
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:11,479
Scott: but if you rip the RAM out like that you might break it.

340
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,967
Scott: So it's it's sort of risky.

341
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:15,540
Scott: You didn't really have to shut down the computer nicely, you know.

342
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,573
Rym: So you could get the RAM out there.

343
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:18,459
Rym: It wouldn't be that hard.

344
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:21,599
Scott: No, I mean you could do a shut down and then pull the RAM out.

345
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,525
Rym: But why don't you just got?

346
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:25,000
Rym: why don't you just pull the power plug pull the RAM out do your thing?

347
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,822
Scott: You could do that.

348
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:26,484
Scott: There you go.

349
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:26,886
Scott: Yeah.

350
00:22:27,287 --> 00:22:31,180
Rym: Yeah, anyway, you could build a tiny UPS into the computer.

351
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:40,886
Rym: All right it's time for things of the day.

352
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:41,146
Rym: now.

353
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:49,779
Rym: this popped up on the internet again suddenly and it pops up perennially and it pops up a Lot in kind of like people will quote it reference it.

354
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:57,120
Rym: Maybe not even realize they're referencing it But there's a film that I think a lot of the internet generation have not actually seen and I'd highly recommend that you do.

355
00:22:57,301 --> 00:22:58,931
Scott: I never heard of it before just now.

356
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:00,380
Rym: This is a fantastic film.

357
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,540
Rym: The film is called network and it was put out in 1976 and I'm not really gonna get into what it's about other than that.

358
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:12,139
Rym: It's a lot like the film Bullworth, which is also a fantastic film that I think you should all see.

359
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:17,792
Rym: This is it said that of all the great speeches of that.

360
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:25,398
Rym: I that I speeches that I think are great In the top 100. many of them are fictional speeches and this is one of them.

361
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:40,620
Rym: This is just a clip from the movie and he basically the main character Gives a sort of speech to the people watching the network news the people people watching TV at home And it is commonly referred to as the I'm mad as hell speech.

362
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:49,273
Rym: This is my thing of the day because I really think that everyone should see this speech think about it and then go and see this movie and think about what that movie is saying.

363
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:55,059
Rym: and then go see the movie Bullworth and Think about what that movie is saying and think about if they're saying the same thing or not.

364
00:23:56,001 --> 00:24:00,620
Scott: Yeah, I mean I've heard people say, you know, I'm mad as hell not gonna take it anymore plenty of times.

365
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,999
Scott: I just never in my life realized it was a reference to this movie that you know.

366
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:11,447
Rym: And even though there was a thing to be referenced and if nothing else as a thing of the day This is a really good video.

367
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:14,040
Rym: It's one of those work you up kind of oh, man.

368
00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:21,069
Rym: Oh, man, if only someone did this in the real world It's a little bit of sanctuary ishness, but not much.

369
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:21,531
Rym: Yeah.

370
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:22,093
Rym: Well that that's.

371
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:24,540
Rym: it's more of a like kind of realistic sanctuariness.

372
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:26,546
Rym: Yeah, it gets.

373
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:28,760
Scott: it gets a little silly to be at the end there.

374
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,427
Rym: Well, it kind of may.

375
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,639
Rym: if you see the rest of the movie It makes a lot more sense.

376
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:42,100
Rym: But the only silly part is that when all the people start yelling outside, there's one woman She has the most annoying voice and I don't know who they got to do those yells.

377
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:50,130
Rym: But the two got the two people who were standing better ADR in the 70s that that was some some some spectacularly bad voice acting Right there.

378
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:51,963
Scott: Yeah Is that it?

379
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:54,734
Rym: I'm mad as hell and I think that's it.

380
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:58,205
Scott: Okay, so Over the years.

381
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:00,918
Scott: There's been a lot of little programs that sort of.

382
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:11,318
Scott: you know Basically do fun physics things, you know, like they'll give you a ramp and some wheels and a. you know a ball maybe and a rope or something like that and they'll they'll let you arrange them in various ways.

383
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:13,967
Scott: and then you know You can apply forces or set friction.

384
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:15,451
Scott: and you know, watch what happens.

385
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:18,200
Scott: just a little 2d physics engine kind of programs.

386
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:19,498
Scott: There's been plenty of these right?

387
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,605
Scott: But there's one dude.

388
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,729
Scott: I don't have his name.

389
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:24,094
Scott: I turn my laptop off.

390
00:25:24,214 --> 00:25:25,338
Scott: Oh, well, you'll go to the website.

391
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:25,660
Scott: You'll see.

392
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,752
Rym: Oh, yeah, by the way, I bought a new lifeboat p80 10.

393
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:29,636
Rym: It's gonna come any day.

394
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:36,093
Scott: Oh, man's great he For his master's thesis project, whatever it was in college.

395
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:42,814
Scott: He made one of these physics engine things but different from all the other physics engine II things that I've ever seen before.

396
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:48,175
Scott: this one is First of all, it's it's got a superior user interface.

397
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,360
Scott: He's got mouse gestures.

398
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:52,293
Scott: He's got you know, a really good menu system.

399
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:53,980
Scott: It looks pretty slick.

400
00:25:54,081 --> 00:26:03,500
Rym: It's not like some crappy flash or Java thing Like most of the ones I've seen before I can just imagine in the hands of a competent physics teacher This being one of the most excellent.

401
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:09,180
Rym: This is the perfect example of how technology can be used to make the educational environments in this country better.

402
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,947
Rym: Well, that's this country anywhere in the world.

403
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:14,020
Rym: This is this is how technology should be used in the classroom.

404
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:18,246
Scott: Anyway, so the program is called fun p-h-u-n.

405
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:19,330
Scott: it's free.

406
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:39,947
Scott: You just download it and use it I guess and You can do all sorts of crazy stuff with the fluids with friction you can make you know, you can make machines you can do all sorts of stuff and it's got a really good user interface and it's can be fun and educational and awesome and cool.

407
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:48,316
Scott: and it's just about everything and Everyone should probably have this and it could be useful and I don't know what else to say.

408
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,460
Scott: I'm still a little bit sick.

409
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:53,293
Rym: Well, I guess we can get right into the main bit and then go to bed.

410
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:54,880
Scott: Yeah, let's let's hurry this up.

411
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,560
Rym: Well, we've talked about this a lot.

412
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:08,039
Rym: We've said multiple times we'll do an episode on this specifically because we've been asked by many of you To do an episode on this and to clarify a very important position that we brought up a lot.

413
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,334
Rym: Yeah, and the position or the idea here is computer literacy.

414
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:28,927
Rym: We did a show a while back on how Maybe not yet, but in the very near future within our lifetimes Being computer literate and technology literate is going to be tantamount to what literacy as in knowing the Language of English or the language reading

415
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:29,449
Scott: and writing

416
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:29,970
Rym: you live in.

417
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:33,380
Scott: reading and writing it will being able to read and write.

418
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:34,061
Scott: Yes we have.

419
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:48,200
Scott: we have said many times in the show before that we believe that in the near future or even in the present not Knowing how to use a computer or not having computer literacy Will be just as bad as not knowing how to read or write.

420
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:57,618
Rym: just as bad specifically we mean Just as crippling and debilitating just as preventative of living a normal life and ever having a big about.

421
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:06,330
Scott: think about how Hard it is for someone to live within our system our Western US society not knowing how to read or write the common language.

422
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:14,200
Scott: That'll be that hard to live within our society not knowing how to use a computer in this in the near future.

423
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:22,215
Rym: Now in that when we talked about that we had a very long episode But we didn't really talk a lot about exactly what computer literacy means.

424
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:24,566
Scott: a lot of people are like well You know they were like.

425
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,600
Scott: how much do you have to know to be computer literate?

426
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,124
Scott: How much are you know coming?

427
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:28,726
Scott: I mean cuz like.

428
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:29,348
Scott: look at it right.

429
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:38,499
Scott: a good example is Japan where you can know the language You can know how to speak and read and write, but they have like how many kanji's right like a zillion.

430
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,432
Scott: and You know people are sort of not everyone knows all of them.

431
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:44,180
Scott: in fact almost nobody knows all of them.

432
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:54,714
Scott: But different people know different amounts and knowing one amount you can get by pretty well, but knowing an even greater amount That's like a special skill, so you know it's like you know.

433
00:28:54,754 --> 00:29:00,417
Scott: how much computer literacy Do you need to have before you'll be you know literate like how good do you have to be?

434
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:01,060
Rym: and also?

435
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:08,205
Rym: It's it's a very complicated thing - I mean we have enough trouble in this country and in the world trying to determine Literacy rates.

436
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:09,230
Rym: it just in general.

437
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,657
Rym: because what exactly is the line?

438
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:11,280
Rym: What is the line?

439
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,590
Rym: Yeah, I mean literate person and a non literate.

440
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,860
Scott: per I mean there are people who can read c-spot run.

441
00:29:16,161 --> 00:29:25,630
Scott: They can read a sports page or a magazine, but not a book not a book That was well played.

442
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:32,920
Rym: yeah, but The the short answer is that there is no short answer to that and also the answer is going to change.

443
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:35,957
Rym: That'll probably what we impressive on you the most.

444
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:41,133
Rym: as well as that I want to get into specifics though because that's the interesting part But I guess we really need to get it.

445
00:29:41,194 --> 00:29:54,620
Rym: make it clear that The bar of computer literacy is going to be ever-changing forever Mm-hmm unlike literacy where language reached a point where I think and language changes pretty even language does change though.

446
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:55,979
Scott: I mean you know there are new words.

447
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,083
Scott: You know you can.

448
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:04,105
Scott: if someone who's sort of old-fashioned tries to talk to someone who is sort of new and hip they have a hard Time understanding.

449
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:05,672
Rym: excuse me my good sir.

450
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:07,260
Rym: Could you direct me to the nearest pugilarium?

451
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:15,840
Scott: Yeah, and at the same time people who are very you know modern with their love have a hard time understanding the old people's.

452
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,409
Rym: I'd be mad shavin.

453
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:21,916
Rym: Yeah, shivin whatever ship shab shab shab shab shab.

454
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:27,272
Scott: so Computer literacy is gonna is a lot like that where you know someone who is.

455
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:30,280
Scott: you know someone who was awesome with the Apple - right?

456
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,346
Scott: Rocking it hard is not.

457
00:30:32,447 --> 00:30:34,133
Scott: may not be computer literate now.

458
00:30:34,193 --> 00:30:37,668
Scott: They may you know that you have to really Keep up-to-date.

459
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:40,140
Scott: you know a lot or else you're in trouble.

460
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:43,373
Rym: But at the same time not everyone needs to be a computer expert.

461
00:30:43,454 --> 00:30:49,889
Scott: not everyone needs to know Everything about like you need to know how to drive But you don't necessarily have to be Michael Schumacher.

462
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:52,840
Scott: only Michael Schumacher has to be Michael Schumacher or even you know.

463
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:54,465
Rym: most people know how to drive.

464
00:30:54,605 --> 00:31:06,280
Rym: in America very relatively few people know know more than the Absolute basics of how their car functions and even fewer than that know how to do anything about a problem with a car.

465
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:07,280
Rym: They take it to a mechanic.

466
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:19,940
Rym: Yep the problem with computers is that you can do a lot more with them and there's a lot more they can go wrong and I Guess the the total depth that could be achieved is already I think beyond what any one person could do.

467
00:31:20,001 --> 00:31:24,273
Rym: There is no person who could be 100% computer literate.

468
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:29,620
Rym: no absolutely I think computers are already beyond what humans could ever fully fully fully understand.

469
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,531
Scott: Well, you know, I mean you get to understand the micro electronic engineer.

470
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:36,078
Rym: I have a working ready knowledge of.

471
00:31:36,098 --> 00:31:40,975
Scott: yeah I mean you'd have to understand the micro electronic engineering the computer engineering.

472
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:46,320
Scott: you'd have to know programming from the assembly language level all the way up to like.

473
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:48,929
Scott: You know the the JavaScript levels.

474
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,040
Scott: you'd have to know how all applications work.

475
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:58,580
Scott: You'd have to understand how the like the monitor works and all the devices work and and all the different electronic components.

476
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:07,145
Scott: It's I mean, I understand all that stuff but not to the tiniest detail and experts at those things often Don't know a lot about other thing.

477
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:13,367
Scott: I mean, yeah, I mean micro electronic engineers usually aren't like, you know Amazing application program or like.

478
00:32:13,969 --> 00:32:15,635
Rym: I'm a I'm an enterprise IT guy.

479
00:32:15,715 --> 00:32:16,920
Rym: I know a lot about IT.

480
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:21,437
Rym: I'm an awful programmer and I barely get by in Python.

481
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:24,560
Rym: Scott Is an awesome programmer knows a lot about programming.

482
00:32:25,102 --> 00:32:28,034
Rym: Scott couldn't deal too well with being put in front of a Cisco router.

483
00:32:28,054 --> 00:32:29,640
Rym: I could do or should I could do?

484
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,044
Scott: Okay with it, but not what.

485
00:32:31,345 --> 00:32:33,594
Rym: what do you type to make it?

486
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:35,260
Rym: let you do anything?

487
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,953
Scott: turn on bitch.

488
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:43,576
Rym: There we go, all right tell that router but I want to get right into it.

489
00:32:43,616 --> 00:32:53,767
Rym: let's talk about Right now as in today Monday, February 25th 2008 in the United States of America in an urban place.

490
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:55,289
Rym: What is what what?

491
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,230
Rym: what do we believe is?

492
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:57,544
Rym: The line?

493
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:58,980
Rym: what is computer literacy?

494
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,038
Rym: Okay What are the things you must know or be able to do in order for Rym and Scott to say you serve our?

495
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,302
Rym: Computer literate?

496
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:13,289
Scott: the first two things are things that not many people realize but it's the first thing that you know Old people have trouble with trying to use the computer.

497
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:14,193
Rym: I know what you're gonna say.

498
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:25,146
Rym: You must have mastery Absolute mastery of the mouse and the keyboard or if you are unable to use either due to a physical problem an Equivalent input device.

499
00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:25,587
Scott: Yes.

500
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:29,720
Scott: There are many things you can do to get by if you cannot use the mouse to the keyboard.

501
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:34,280
Scott: For example, if you have no arms, you can use a thing called Dasher coconut monkey.

502
00:33:34,602 --> 00:33:37,639
Rym: How is it that despite having neither arms nor legs you continue to beat me?

503
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:54,297
Scott: Yes, or if you have boxing gloves on your hands you can type anyway Right, so if you need to be able to type without looking at the keyboard and whatever language it is Your keyboard is in you need to you know Be able to use the keyboard quickly and efficiently and know where all the keys are know what keys do what

504
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:54,980
Rym: you need.

505
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:59,329
Rym: You need to be able to use the mouse now not When I say be able to you move the mouse.

506
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:00,856
Rym: you should be able to now.

507
00:34:00,896 --> 00:34:03,734
Rym: this might sound dumb But you know, we're talking about computer literacy.

508
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:11,179
Rym: if we were talking about literacy It's like be able to use phonics to figure out a rough pronunciation of a word with which you are unfamiliar.

509
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,480
Rym: You know, that's the level we're talking at here.

510
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:20,659
Rym: You need to be able to move the mouse pointer relatively quickly from one arbitrary point to another arbitrary point.

511
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:23,480
Scott: You need to basically have it in your muscle memory.

512
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:34,676
Scott: If it's not in your if using the mouse is not in your muscle memory and you have to use your conscious brain if you're moving Your whole arm if you're looking at the most to move your whole arm, but well, it depends.

513
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:35,760
Rym: Yeah different schools of thought.

514
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,090
Scott: There are different schools of thought.

515
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:46,699
Rym: when I say moving your whole arm I think you get the image of the old lady who's like gripping the mouse for dear life and like Scooting it across at an awkward angle while staring it.

516
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:55,920
Scott: You need to be able to click you be able to double click you need to be able to drag and drop and you need To be able to do those things without really thinking it needs to be in your muscle memory.

517
00:34:56,331 --> 00:34:58,565
Rym: Yes now you also along those lines.

518
00:34:58,585 --> 00:35:05,725
Rym: when it comes to mice and keyboards you need to understand the the jargon the language the The vernacular of computing.

519
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:12,566
Rym: you need to know what a right click and a left click and a context menu and a middle click are A double click a triple click.

520
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:17,399
Rym: you need to be able to execute these maneuvers and if directed to know what they are.

521
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:21,260
Rym: Yep, it the fact that there that I run into people.

522
00:35:21,603 --> 00:35:34,793
Rym: Well, I'm not anymore now that I work at an awesome company But when I worked at the other the hospital I ran into people on a daily basis who had worked with computers for much of their lives who I Believe could not effectively type or use a mouse.

523
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:35,495
Rym: Mm-hmm.

524
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:38,626
Scott: It's true We go to be able right-click.

525
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:41,416
Scott: They'd be like what the other mouse button the one you don't usually use.

526
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:51,396
Rym: Okay, and Right along those lines you need to be able to identify the most basic of connectivity problems related to input devices.

527
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:56,819
Rym: if you're typing and Nothing happens you look and see if the keyboard is plugged in.

528
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:00,679
Rym: You know what num lock does you hit it to see if the light is lighting up or not?

529
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:01,464
Scott: Mm-hmm.

530
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:04,320
Scott: You need to know where these things plug in.

531
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,151
Scott: I mean, you don't need to know that this one's a USB or that.

532
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:09,260
Scott: well, you should know that but you don't necessarily.

533
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:12,420
Scott: You know that but you need to know this plug goes in that hole.

534
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:17,160
Scott: You know You need to know which things go where in when you're plugging them into the box.

535
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:24,100
Rym: Everyone who is computer literate should be able to if given a new mouse and keyboard replace their old mouse and keyboard without direction.

536
00:36:24,513 --> 00:36:31,075
Rym: Yep Now there might be Drivers or crap within like if you get a fancy mouse or like a special tablet.

537
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:32,880
Rym: and that's beyond this I'm talking about physically.

538
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:39,080
Scott: Yeah, like it in you don't need to know about the inside of your computer so much But you need to know about every hole on the outside.

539
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:45,174
Scott: You need to know the power button the reset button the CD-ROM Anything that is on the outside of the box.

540
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:46,100
Scott: that is your computer.

541
00:36:46,482 --> 00:36:49,159
Scott: You need to know how that works and what it means and what it does.

542
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:59,030
Rym: we need to know the difference between the reset button and the power button and and You need to know that holding the power button down is different from pressing it and both are important.

543
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:03,325
Scott: Yeah, you need to know pretty much how everything on the outside of the computer works entirely.

544
00:37:03,646 --> 00:37:04,650
Scott: which hole you know?

545
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,541
Scott: This is the hole where the monitor plugs in.

546
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:08,069
Scott: This is the hole where the network plugs in.

547
00:37:08,452 --> 00:37:11,129
Scott: This is the hole where you know the modem plugs in.

548
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:13,890
Rym: now You don't need to understand them on a deeper level than that.

549
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,489
Rym: You just need to know what plugs into what or at least know that that is not where you plug this in.

550
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:24,530
Rym: Yep, if there's not identified hole as long as you're not using that hole and it never comes up.

551
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:30,030
Rym: I mean if someone can't identify a firewire hole and they're not using firewire devices, that's not bad.

552
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:37,216
Scott: But if you're trying to jam a USB stick in there You need to be able to go to the store and buy any external thing and then get it to work.

553
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:38,360
Rym: and along those lines.

554
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:52,349
Rym: you need to be able to know when you go to a store and You're buying an external component whether or not you have a USB or a USB 2.0 or not Yep, or at least be able to identify the fact that you do not know

555
00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:53,173
Scott: Mm-hmm

556
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,150
Rym: and be able to ask the right question.

557
00:37:56,611 --> 00:38:01,870
Rym: Do I have this to someone who can then look and tell you if you can't go to the store and buy things?

558
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,729
Scott: They got to go with your computer and know if you're buying the right thing, then you have a serious problem.

559
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,512
Rym: now We're all again.

560
00:38:07,673 --> 00:38:09,600
Rym: We're only talking about simple peripherals.

561
00:38:09,861 --> 00:38:12,190
Rym: I'm not talking about hard drives RAM all that.

562
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,636
Rym: Yeah, you should be able to buy a monitor.

563
00:38:13,656 --> 00:38:26,169
Scott: You should be able to buy a mouse or a keyboard or USB stick or You know an external hard drive or a joystick or any any of these sorts of everyday things You should be able to buy and get them working without help.

564
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:28,961
Rym: All right people now regards to monitors.

565
00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:42,068
Rym: to be computer literate You need to know at least on a basic level what screen resolution is how to change it in your operating system of choice What resolution your display is?

566
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:49,270
Rym: Optimally what the benefits and drawbacks are of using or not using the optimal resolution.

567
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:52,283
Scott: Yep, you need to sort of understand.

568
00:38:52,323 --> 00:38:55,217
Scott: in terms of monitors You seem you need to understand.

569
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:58,089
Scott: first of all, the monitor and the computer are two different things.

570
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:03,110
Scott: Yes, a lot of people don't realize the monitor is just a TV and the computer is the computer.

571
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:08,808
Scott: You know a lot of people like we'll call the monitor the computer and they'll call the computer the CPU or they'll call it the hard drive.

572
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,392
Scott: Yeah All those the basic terms.

573
00:39:10,412 --> 00:39:25,613
Rym: you need to know what the following terms mean hard drive disk CD rewritable media monitor LCD CRT.

574
00:39:27,112 --> 00:39:28,316
Scott: Yeah, pretty much all that, you know.

575
00:39:28,477 --> 00:39:29,521
Scott: video card.

576
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:34,299
Rym: Yes the basic basic stuff you need to know what a video mouse keyboard?

577
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:40,920
Rym: all you need to know is what a video card is and Fundamentally that it makes the pixels appear on your screen.

578
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,107
Rym: You do need to know by the way what a pixel is CD-ROM.

579
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,490
Scott: You need to know the basic words of the parts of the computer.

580
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:55,898
Scott: I mean like you open your car, you may not know what a transmission does but you need to know transmission engine Alternator battery.

581
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,719
Rym: Yes now Word screen resolution.

582
00:39:58,739 --> 00:39:59,343
Rym: You might think what.

583
00:39:59,383 --> 00:40:00,550
Rym: why screen resolution?

584
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:09,150
Rym: That's like the number two Problem I ran into working with non-technical people is they'd complain that the screens too big the screens too small.

585
00:40:09,411 --> 00:40:11,558
Rym: They can't see everything's too big.

586
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:13,766
Rym: something disappeared off the side of the screen.

587
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:14,910
Rym: How do I change the size?

588
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,390
Scott: I don't want to get off on a tangent but a lot of people especially people have a hard time seeing.

589
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:26,190
Scott: We'll have giant monitors with very high native resolutions and they will turn the resolution way down to make everything larger.

590
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:27,930
Scott: That is the wrong way.

591
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:38,110
Scott: What you should do is you should set the optimal resolution To the incredibly high resolution of the giant monitor and you should increase the size of your fonts and icons to be incredibly huge.

592
00:40:38,491 --> 00:40:39,757
Scott: That is the correct way.

593
00:40:39,777 --> 00:40:42,569
Scott: I don't want to say any more about it because that's a rant I have?

594
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:45,960
Scott: Yes, but nobody does it that way even though it's the way you should do it.

595
00:40:46,582 --> 00:40:49,030
Rym: now onto the computer and operating system itself.

596
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:56,170
Rym: You need to be able to navigate to and use every basic function of your operating system of choice.

597
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,410
Scott: You need to know how to change any settings.

598
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:04,210
Rym: You may want to change any at least any superficial GUI setting or basic internal setting.

599
00:41:04,351 --> 00:41:10,942
Scott: You need to know how to be able to add and remove Applications and use applications and know which applications do what.

600
00:41:11,043 --> 00:41:13,068
Scott: generally you need to know how to read.

601
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,649
Scott: pretty much You know what?

602
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:19,006
Scott: It comes down to is a lot of people do not read the things that it says on the screen.

603
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:30,766
Scott: and even if they do Read them like they read the words, but they don't process the words in their brain like it'll say warning Mouse not detected and someone will call and say I got this error.

604
00:41:30,806 --> 00:41:31,710
Rym: I don't know what it means.

605
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:32,974
Rym: Yeah, what's it say?

606
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:34,641
Scott: warning mouse not detected?

607
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:37,030
Scott: Well, maybe the mouse hasn't been detected.

608
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,969
Scott: Did you check the mouse to make sure it's plugged in?

609
00:41:39,431 --> 00:41:40,753
Scott: I don't know they don't.

610
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:49,936
Scott: you have to be able to read what it says on the screen and think about it in your brain and Understand what it says.

611
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:55,413
Scott: that includes what menus say what dialog boxes say whatever Harsh.

612
00:41:55,453 --> 00:41:58,710
Rym: but if you cannot or will not do that you are not and will never be computer literate.

613
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,808
Scott: You're not even regular literate.

614
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:05,127
Scott: But that's the number one problem people have trying to use a computer is they don't read what it says.

615
00:42:05,207 --> 00:42:10,630
Scott: or if they do Read what it says they only translate the words into sounds.

616
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:14,450
Scott: They don't actually translate the words into the ideas that they represent.

617
00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:21,169
Scott: You know and if a word if anywhere on your computer screen There is a word you need to know what that word means.

618
00:42:21,732 --> 00:42:31,058
Scott: Unless you know, maybe you're reading some scientific paper on a website or something but any word that is part of an application interface that is part of the user interface of the Applications you were using.

619
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,910
Scott: you need to know all of those words.

620
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:35,277
Scott: They need to be part of your vocabulary every single one of them.

621
00:42:35,398 --> 00:42:36,742
Rym: now in terms of files.

622
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:45,510
Rym: You need to know where any file you put or cause to be put on your computer is.

623
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:48,710
Rym: You need to know where it went and why it went there.

624
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:52,422
Scott: Not only that you need to understand the idea of a file system.

625
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:59,970
Rym: a lot of people don't get file systems buried You know, you don't need to know that, you know, like I know There's in riser FS and XFS.

626
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:08,952
Scott: but you need to understand the concept of a hierarchical set of files and directories and folders and how they work and file extensions.

627
00:43:09,012 --> 00:43:13,002
Scott: and you need to sort of understand that files are arranged in this way.

628
00:43:13,062 --> 00:43:16,010
Scott: and you know different files go in different places.

629
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:20,958
Scott: and how to organize files copying the simple test studies running.

630
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:27,561
Rym: you need to know how to navigate to Any file that you have caused to be placed on the computer.

631
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:36,019
Rym: if files get on your computer by actions You have taken and you do not know where they are and you do not know how to find where they are You're not computer literate.

632
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:41,721
Scott: You need to know renaming Copying cutting pasting files moving editing creating.

633
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:49,644
Rym: Yes, and at least have a basic understanding of Some way to organize your files so that you will be able to find them in the future.

634
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:54,358
Rym: that might involve something like Google Desktop But you need to understand a lot of people.

635
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:55,180
Rym: ideally

636
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:10,392
Scott: you would understand the connection between you know The sort of abstraction of a file system user interface and the actual hardware, you know Understand that C colon is a hard drive and D colon is a CD ROM and a colon is a floppy drive But

637
00:44:10,693 --> 00:44:11,678
Rym: that's a little bit beyond.

638
00:44:11,698 --> 00:44:13,929
Rym: you just need to know where the files you got are.

639
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:19,673
Rym: Yep, and the number of people who don't that those people are not computer literate new Not at all.

640
00:44:20,255 --> 00:44:25,490
Scott: Now the other thing I think is the hardest thing and I don't know if it's an absolute requirement.

641
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:35,900
Scott: I think it is going to be pretty much if it isn't already is that you should be able to pick up and install any Application any application whatsoever for your operating system.

642
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:48,289
Scott: get it installed know how to can can fit be able to figure out By reading and looking at it Intuitively how to configure it and how to use its most basic features and get it to do its basic task.

643
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:49,875
Scott: now No matter what the application.

644
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,462
Rym: now, there are obvious exceptions to this.

645
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:54,714
Scott: like you shouldn't be able to pick up Photoshop It'd be a Photoshop master.

646
00:44:54,935 --> 00:45:04,196
Rym: Well, there are very clear exceptions to this programs that have poorly written installers programs that are meant for technical users.

647
00:45:04,638 --> 00:45:11,330
Rym: my two examples are pretty much any craftily written program and Web sphere.

648
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:17,185
Rym: If you cannot install web sphere you that does not make you not computer literate.

649
00:45:17,205 --> 00:45:19,050
Rym: that makes you a happy person.

650
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:23,205
Rym: Yeah Because if you are a person who can knows how to intuitively install web sphere.

651
00:45:23,526 --> 00:45:27,678
Rym: you have led a sad Life and I feel sorry for you because good God, but

652
00:45:27,698 --> 00:45:46,054
Scott: if we're talking about web browsers instant messengers word processors spreadsheets Everyday applications anything that you can buy the shelf in staples anything you can download from like download calm any Normal everyday application that is meant for you to be used by you You know as targeting

653
00:45:46,254 --> 00:45:46,776
Rym: or you

654
00:45:47,057 --> 00:46:02,297
Scott: any application that is for you targeted as you being the user You should be able to figure out how to use it without you know Reading the help and spending, you know You need to basically in you have these skill to intuit The default use of any application

655
00:46:02,378 --> 00:46:14,994
Rym: or in the very least in the very very least to be able to articulate Your question if you are unable to install something to someone who will be able to help you in a way That will allow them to help you.

656
00:46:15,014 --> 00:46:15,977
Rym: Mm-hmm.

657
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:20,290
Rym: If you can do that that excuses almost any misunderstanding.

658
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:33,134
Scott: Yeah, if you can, you know If you call someone for help and you can actually communicate to them your problem Then and they can actually help you just based on what you say then you're a computer literate All right.

659
00:46:33,395 --> 00:46:35,370
Rym: Let's talk a little bit about the Internet.

660
00:46:35,731 --> 00:46:43,649
Rym: Of course, you need to understand the difference between the Internet your web browser Email web pages all these basic.

661
00:46:44,713 --> 00:46:49,270
Rym: You need to know what bookmarks are how to manage them and access them in your browser of choice.

662
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:50,716
Rym: You should know this.

663
00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:51,480
Rym: this was actually.

664
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,810
Rym: I think this is a straight-up requirement.

665
00:46:53,931 --> 00:46:57,530
Rym: I think anyone who cannot do this is by no means even close to computer literacy.

666
00:46:58,931 --> 00:47:05,736
Rym: You should not at least I'm gonna give a really low threshold here 95% of the time.

667
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:11,160
Rym: if Confronted with a shady or phishing website.

668
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:15,130
Rym: You should be able to know immediately that is a shady or phishing website.

669
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:16,588
Scott: Oh, yeah cannot do that.

670
00:47:17,412 --> 00:47:20,621
Rym: You have not gotten to the point where you really understand the internet.

671
00:47:20,842 --> 00:47:33,305
Scott: you if you can't tell a spam email from a legitimate Email just by looking at say the subject line then and the in the from I say 90% 95% of the time because occasionally, there's the masterpiece.

672
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:40,286
Rym: but Seriously, the vast majority of the time if you cannot immediately look at a website and say this is trustworthy.

673
00:47:40,306 --> 00:47:44,221
Rym: This isn't trustworthy or This is a phishing site.

674
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:45,430
Rym: This is my banking site.

675
00:47:45,691 --> 00:47:48,809
Rym: You should not be on the internet because that is very dangerous for you to be there.

676
00:47:49,071 --> 00:47:51,302
Scott: Yeah, that's like if you can't if you're going to.

677
00:47:52,629 --> 00:47:57,909
Scott: you know Some dangerous neighborhood and you can't tell you know, who's a cop and who's a mugger?

678
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:00,470
Scott: You probably shouldn't be in a dangerous neighborhood.

679
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:04,503
Rym: Now also in terms of the internet again, you know files.

680
00:48:04,523 --> 00:48:06,210
Rym: if you download files, you should know where they go.

681
00:48:06,932 --> 00:48:11,250
Scott: You should be able to understand the concept of downloading files and uploading.

682
00:48:12,314 --> 00:48:19,209
Rym: You should understand what plugins are Basic plugins be able to install them and use them in your operating system of choice.

683
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:23,685
Scott: You should know like, you know, what's up like a web browser plug-in and what's another.

684
00:48:23,785 --> 00:48:25,130
Scott: you know, you should understand.

685
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:26,696
Scott: You know what you're doing when you're doing.

686
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:32,229
Scott: if you ever do anything on your computer and you don't fully understand You don't have to understand it down to the lowest level.

687
00:48:32,691 --> 00:48:46,590
Scott: But if you're installing say a Firefox extension, you shouldn't have that confused with say, you know a widget for your dashboard or you know a Plug in for your Photoshop, you know, you shouldn't have these things confused.

688
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:50,544
Scott: You should know what you're installing when you're installing it what you're doing when you're doing it.

689
00:48:50,585 --> 00:48:54,303
Scott: if you ever do something You don't know exactly what you're doing.

690
00:48:54,344 --> 00:48:57,374
Scott: You just know it works or You know something like that.

691
00:48:57,495 --> 00:48:58,538
Scott: Then you have a problem.

692
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,488
Rym: Yeah, but the bare bare minimum there too.

693
00:49:02,832 --> 00:49:20,324
Rym: When it comes to online website, well god online websites, but like websites or computers or anything that has authentication You need to be able to come up with and remember Login names and passwords or at least have a way of retrieving said login names and pass and know

694
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:23,841
Scott: which ones you should be able to get to Separate the idea of which ones go where.

695
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:27,215
Scott: if to understand this is a wet This is a password for this website.

696
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:32,950
Rym: You need to understand my computer what a login and a password are and what they entail.

697
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:38,133
Scott: Yep, and like a lot of people just you know, there's like oh I have a username and password They don't understand.

698
00:49:38,534 --> 00:49:41,023
Scott: this one is for this and this one is for that.

699
00:49:41,084 --> 00:49:42,830
Scott: you need to you know understand.

700
00:49:43,172 --> 00:49:47,110
Scott: You know the difference in a website and application your operating system your computer.

701
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:52,950
Scott: You know the separation between which things are what you know where the boundaries are between different items.

702
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:56,464
Scott: Really you need to understand that now on your computer.

703
00:49:57,147 --> 00:50:07,789
Rym: along these lines You need to understand what an account is that you have one and how to do basic account functions like changing your username changing your password.

704
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:13,610
Scott: Yeah, if you don't understand the idea of user accounts and multi-user systems then you got a problem now.

705
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:19,610
Rym: You don't need to understand how to elevate something administrative whatever, you know I mean we're talking about the lowest level here.

706
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:26,910
Rym: You need to understand that accounts exist that you have one that you log into it Maybe you've set it up to log in automatically that there can be more than one account.

707
00:50:27,454 --> 00:50:28,987
Rym: But you have to know that you have done this.

708
00:50:29,852 --> 00:50:40,040
Rym: Yep, and I think I think that covers pretty much 99% of what constitutes basic minimal Absolutely minimal computer literacy.

709
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,790
Scott: I mean, I think we could probably go on more.

710
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:51,090
Scott: I mean that's for right now, you know in the future It's only gonna be more and more that you're gonna need to know, you know Things are gonna get more complicated or you know, there's gonna be new things.

711
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,748
Scott: You're gonna have to understand these new things.

712
00:50:53,332 --> 00:51:11,148
Rym: But I really believe at this juncture in time as of today at 8 10 p.m On Monday February 25th 2008 if you can do all of the things that we have said I believe that you are at least minimally computer literate and if you cannot do these things You should really be working on being able to do these things quickly because the world is going to leave

713
00:51:11,188 --> 00:51:11,770
Scott: you behind.

714
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:12,715
Scott: Yeah, I mean I could.

715
00:51:12,997 --> 00:51:15,350
Scott: we could probably sit her out and think of a few more things to say.

716
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:16,216
Scott: But you know, I don't know.

717
00:51:16,236 --> 00:51:18,230
Rym: I want to keep it pretty simple because that's enough.

718
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:24,630
Rym: I mean we're talking about the lowest level like what you need to even be considered competent enough to touch a computer.

719
00:51:31,111 --> 00:51:33,701
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

720
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:35,850
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

721
00:51:36,576 --> 00:51:47,916
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes links our awesome forum a link to our frapper map and Links to all the RSS feeds.

722
00:51:48,337 --> 00:51:54,054
