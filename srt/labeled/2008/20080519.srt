00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,127
Rym: It's Monday, May 19th.

2
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:11,869
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,580
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:20,820
Rym: We don't mince any words and we talk about tech issues the way we talk about tech issues in our real lives.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,918
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:34,165
Rym: So I'm driving to work this morning, and I'm driving to work.

7
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:35,230
Scott: Why are you driving to work?

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,016
Rym: Well, I'm driving to the train station.

9
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:40,668
Scott: Okay where and then oh oh you told me this already.

10
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:41,130
Rym: I did.

11
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:42,939
Scott: How could this not be the opening bit?

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,950
Rym: so I'm driving to the train station.

13
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:51,550
Rym: I'm running a little late Which doesn't really say much because I'm always running about two minutes late whenever I go for the train.

14
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:57,397
Rym: So I always make it, but I think I've been late to work Once for missing a train ever and that's cuz.

15
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:59,565
Rym: this really slow van got in my way.

16
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:04,483
Rym: There's nothing I could do about it Mm-hmm, but as I'm driving you know I don't really pay attention.

17
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:08,461
Rym: It's like it's 4 455 o'clock in the morning.

18
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,849
Rym: I'm barely awake In the morning.

19
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:14,898
Rym: I'm driving so I'm in my car.

20
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:20,126
Rym: I noticed that all the transmission fluid I'd added to my car yesterday leaked out, so I got a deal with that.

21
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,556
Scott: awesome Not all of it.

22
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,006
Scott: where didn't you add the Sealy stuff?

23
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,550
Rym: No?

24
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,690
Rym: I just added transmission fluid way to go.

25
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:27,639
Scott: Why did you just pour it right on the ground?

26
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,286
Rym: because I wanted to see how fast the leak was.

27
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:30,029
Rym: now that I know that?

28
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:37,110
Rym: It leaks quickly I'm gonna use the leak sealer and that's gonna keep it long enough until I buy a new goddamn car.

29
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,289
Scott: Hey, I think you need to start looking at cars now.

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,961
Scott: Of course what you should do if I were you is You could start biking to the train station about now right?

31
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:45,322
Scott: no.

32
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:46,407
Rym: You know freaking cold.

33
00:01:46,447 --> 00:01:47,130
Scott: It is in the morning.

34
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:49,390
Scott: I don't know how cold it is that early in the morning.

35
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,370
Scott: How cold it I when I walked out of the door it was nice.

36
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,595
Rym: Yes, you walk out.

37
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,584
Rym: You know what when you walked out the door.

38
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,850
Rym: I was already at work.

39
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:58,557
Rym: I'd been at work for a while.

40
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:03,654
Scott: if I were you I would sell the car while it goes Soon.

41
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:05,709
Scott: it's not gonna go and the price will drop in half.

42
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:14,309
Rym: No because the the real trick there is you trade it in because Trading in is good too, but trade it in while it still goes.

43
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:20,489
Rym: The thing is I know it's gonna keep going for a while because the one thing I know is the transmission is bad.

44
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:24,325
Rym: Yeah, but it's not so bad that it's gonna explode on me anytime soon.

45
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:25,670
Rym: I know how much time I got left with this.

46
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,454
Scott: Yeah, I've never.

47
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:26,634
Scott: I've.

48
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:27,780
Scott: actually I got a sir.

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,970
Scott: I think it's time to service the transmission in my car.

50
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,096
Scott: I've never done that I should take.

51
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:33,470
Scott: I'm gonna take it to the dealer though because I don't trust the other places.

52
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,226
Rym: Transmission service isn't that hard to do yeah, but you know who knows my car.

53
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:45,628
Rym: Yeah, yeah If I if I own a new car I'd probably Go to a lot more reputable mechanics than I tend to go to.

54
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:50,296
Scott: yeah Yeah, if I had a piece of shit car I would go to the most unreputable mechanics that I could find.

55
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:58,590
Scott: cuz I when I had to get my car fixed before I drove around some shady looking because like When your car is brand new you're like make this like it was you know a month ago when it was really brand new.

56
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:03,409
Scott: You're like put duct tape on it your life's make it keep going another month.

57
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:07,409
Rym: Yes, so it's like how many more days will a hundred bucks get me?

58
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:13,190
Rym: but Anyway, so I'm driving to work, and I'm just totally zoned out.

59
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:13,575
Rym: I'm just.

60
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:16,617
Rym: I'm pretty much thinking Get on the train and then I can sleep.

61
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,223
Rym: get on the train and then I can sleep.

62
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,729
Rym: get on this is that a butt?

63
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:20,912
Rym: What?

64
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:28,495
Rym: so I'm driving and on the right in front of it's not a school anymore But it was a school now.

65
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,745
Rym: It's like I don't know exactly it's for sale still.

66
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:39,681
Rym: well currently people are leasing it And I found that out because I read the school budget and they make $150,000 a year from leasing that building to someone.

67
00:03:40,283 --> 00:03:42,570
Rym: uh-huh, but and there's a community garden in front of it.

68
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,564
Rym: But I look up and I see yeah, how does a community garden work?

69
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:47,709
Scott: Can we just take stuff out of it?

70
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,694
Rym: Probably not.

71
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:51,521
Scott: oh can we put things into it?

72
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:54,879
Rym: possibly we should ask I wonder how it works Over there.

73
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:56,030
Scott: well, I mean this herbs there.

74
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:07,726
Scott: So it's like can I put some herbs in and take some herbs out like stuff in taking stuff I'll go I'll go drop off like a little cup of tomatoes if I can get some Red Oaks Mill where we were mountain biking that one time.

75
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:08,590
Rym: you went mountain biking.

76
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:17,981
Rym: There's a farm collective there And you can get pretty much for free as long as you ask and you actually do stuff a little like Five foot by five foot plot in a nice farm.

77
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,945
Rym: You can grow whatever you want.

78
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:20,130
Rym: They don't slow far away.

79
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,204
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but I don't need a plot.

80
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:39,290
Rym: I have a bucket Anyway, but there was a but we held him in suspense on the bus stared at it And as I'm driving, I only saw it for about 25 seconds, and I probably would have stopped Because maybe this person was in distress.

81
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:49,623
Rym: But they were obviously moving and if they had somehow died or passed out in that position I don't know if I was equipped to help them wait.

82
00:04:49,643 --> 00:04:50,586
Scott: They were on the ground.

83
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:51,490
Rym: Oh, they were standing.

84
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,130
Rym: Okay, but they were kind of leaning.

85
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:55,374
Scott: That's what you do when you're mooning.

86
00:04:55,816 --> 00:05:03,374
Rym: Yes, but they were wiggling it around and their hands were back there spreading it And it was a little.

87
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:08,510
Rym: I hate to be crude so I'm hoping that the humor of the situation will outweigh the crudeness.

88
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:13,956
Scott: But it was a poopy, but uh Maybe they were just asked for someone to help him wipe.

89
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:28,333
Rym: all I could think as I'm driving by is all right, dude You might be in trouble right now, but there's very little I am equipped with to help you and I'm cute.

90
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,961
Rym: I'm not I don't have time to deal with it.

91
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:31,007
Scott: You know wipes in the car.

92
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:31,650
Rym: No, I don't.

93
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:33,256
Rym: No, I don't.

94
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:36,636
Rym: I Think what was happening.

95
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:41,190
Rym: my 25-second assessment because remember I was the only person on the road.

96
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:44,569
Rym: This is like a half hour before the morning rush hour starts.

97
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:47,799
Rym: I think I was pretty animated too.

98
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:51,691
Rym: I think it was crazy bum poopy, but Drunken.

99
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,738
Scott: crazy bum poopy, but I don't know.

100
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:56,749
Rym: drunken but definitely crazy bum poopy, but alrighty.

101
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:04,970
Rym: But the scary thing is in the 25 seconds I had to stare at that thing it took me a half that time to figure out that it was a butt.

102
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:06,296
Scott: Why what do you think?

103
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:06,980
Scott: it was cuz?

104
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,950
Rym: you know when you wake up and you're not quite awake.

105
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:15,826
Rym: So, you know your alarms going off or your phones ringing But you think it's the other thing and you're banging on your alarm clock.

106
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:16,790
Rym: Why won't it stop?

107
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,566
Rym: I like that when I'm driving I am cuz it's four o'clock in the morning.

108
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:26,730
Rym: All right Boobie, but okay crazy bum poopy, but that was my morning.

109
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,029
Scott: Okay, you want to do this news?

110
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,310
Scott: We have to not need to avoid talking about this news for hours have to avoid talking all the ancillary issues to it.

111
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:37,815
Scott: Yes, you ready for this.

112
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:38,418
Scott: I'm right.

113
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:39,703
Scott: You really you don't know what this is yet.

114
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:40,968
Rym: Do you know I'd cuz?

115
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:43,839
Rym: I didn't Actually, I worked on stuff all day.

116
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:44,883
Rym: I didn't even take a lunch.

117
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,370
Rym: So I didn't get to read the internet.

118
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:56,389
Scott: so today Google launched a new Google thing called Google Health and It's not a competitor with WebMD or any of those type of sites.

119
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:58,528
Scott: what Google Health is?

120
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:18,565
Scott: as you get an account right and then any of the Medical institutions doctors pharmacies hospitals that are partnered up with Google Health You can Digitally request your medical records and Google Health will aggregate them for you now.

121
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:24,426
Rym: I Am so ambivalent on this issue.

122
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:30,808
Rym: on one hand One that puts the company I used to work for out of fucking business.

123
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:35,962
Scott: good Well, I mean is the other problems right is all right.

124
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:37,929
Scott: Let's just go through the list of problems here.

125
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:40,213
Scott: ready Privacy issues.

126
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:41,557
Scott: Google has your health record.

127
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:50,448
Rym: Yes, but at the same time from the Rym perspective looking at myself My metal my personal medical records mean nothing to anyone with me.

128
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:57,935
Scott: And yeah, I really don't care if you know when I got a tetanus shot, but at the same time I understand Why many out like.

129
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:04,530
Rym: I understand the concerns people have about medical records and I can see many situations Where I might not want my medical records to be out there.

130
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:15,969
Rym: Google knows I have of the AIDS another one hire me, but at the same time my personal medical records, frankly I wouldn't care if even the listeners had him because you don't have any weird medical issues that my medical records say.

131
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:17,574
Rym: great Wow, he's in good health.

132
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:19,621
Rym: His cholesterol is practically zero.

133
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:23,535
Rym: is my blood pressure is 120 over 60 Exactly.

134
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:28,753
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you had some problems that you know were Delicate issue.

135
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:29,495
Rym: Well, I have one.

136
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:32,465
Rym: his his member is just so so gigantic.

137
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:33,909
Scott: I know staggers the mind.

138
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:44,027
Rym: Journal articles have been written about it Right Anyway, so anyway it I'm sorta isn't that right Simba?

139
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,191
Scott: Yeah, I Don't know.

140
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:48,037
Scott: I'm having some some problems.

141
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:49,341
Rym: Well, here's here's the thing.

142
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,070
Rym: I can sum all the issues up very simply.

143
00:08:52,673 --> 00:09:00,086
Rym: Google a hitherto up until now Google has been expanding and kind of everything Google is added.

144
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:11,390
Rym: It's like alright, I Trust Google with X and in return I get Y. first I trusted them with my searching and the searches I do and in return I get the best search results in the world.

145
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:19,989
Rym: And then I trusted them with the ability to read every email I ever send or receive and in return I don't have to deal with stupid squirrel mail anymore.

146
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:26,830
Rym: And then I trusted them with every document I write and in return I can access my documents anywhere.

147
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:35,058
Rym: But now I have to trust them with my medical records and I think this is the line where if Google was going to be Evil, this is it.

148
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,767
Rym: This is where it's gonna be.

149
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:37,350
Scott: I don't know.

150
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,572
Scott: I think they're gonna go one step further credit card Google credit.

151
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:48,590
Scott: once they get the Google like accounting software where they have all your financial information About everything you buy and all the money in your bank account and everything.

152
00:09:49,793 --> 00:10:00,275
Scott: When they get that information then they own you and it's only After they get everything that they're gonna fuck you over because then you'll have no recourse whatsoever because you won't have money for the Lawyer, you won't have.

153
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:04,030
Rym: I don't know exactly how to kill you on June 1st 2011.

154
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,779
Rym: I don't know everything that gained awareness.

155
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:11,558
Scott: They'll know everything you think and say so that they can control you What they know already.

156
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:13,770
Rym: think about the aggregate information they have on Rym.

157
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:21,591
Rym: They know everything I've searched for for the past several years and every email I've sent and received and all the documents I've written.

158
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:22,413
Rym: and you know what.

159
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:28,490
Rym: if you look at the Google ads in my gmail, they're pretty spot-on in terms of my interests.

160
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,338
Scott: Yeah, I don't look at the ads in the gmail.

161
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:34,790
Rym: Well, the other thing is they they know exactly where I live.

162
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:35,828
Rym: They know where I work.

163
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:40,390
Rym: They know where I go because I type all the addresses I go to into Google Maps all the time.

164
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,163
Scott: Yeah, get an Android phone now.

165
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:43,150
Scott: They know where you are.

166
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:45,210
Rym: Blackberry has the GPS.

167
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,469
Rym: Google Maps always knows where I am.

168
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:50,401
Rym: In fact, I tell it to know where I am because I always ask it.

169
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:51,926
Rym: Where's the nearest Starbucks?

170
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:52,770
Rym: Where's the nearest bank?

171
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:54,069
Rym: Where's the nearest whatever?

172
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,757
Scott: So yeah, it's a. do we trust Google?

173
00:10:57,797 --> 00:11:04,414
Scott: the other thing that bothers me about this is they used some words I don't like such as Holistic or

174
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:05,460
Rym: poopy, but well

175
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:15,265
Scott: holistic literally means, you know Like you know, if I say we can get a holistic look at your medical situation That means I can look at all your medical records and look at the whole thing.

176
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:16,269
Scott: No, that is good.

177
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,483
Rym: However, the word holistic has been co-opted by Randy bullshit.

178
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:26,785
Scott: exactly when someone says oh We'll get a holistic will give you a holistic treatment.

179
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:32,959
Scott: That means Instead of giving you medicine for your problem We're gonna give you a whole bunch of Randy bullshit.

180
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:40,770
Scott: that way you're getting the whole treatment as in Missing treatment and the Randy, you know fake medicine fills in that hole.

181
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,950
Rym: You're definitely getting the whole treatment as in that's what they'll bear you in after it stops working.

182
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,449
Scott: Poopy asshole treatment.

183
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:52,022
Rym: No, no, no, no No poopy, but is funny saying poopy asshole is not funny?

184
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:54,350
Rym: that that evokes a whole new set of imagery.

185
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:56,156
Scott: I know here's something else right?

186
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:58,845
Rym: Okay, go to Google Health, right?

187
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,529
Scott: Let's say you have I don't know Allergies, right?

188
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:07,666
Scott: Do you want allergy medicine ads on your Google Health?

189
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:08,709
Rym: I don't care about that.

190
00:12:09,414 --> 00:12:10,966
Scott: But then you're getting into issues there.

191
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:16,142
Scott: now You're talking like Pharmaceutical companies paying big money to Google.

192
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:18,453
Scott: so that cuz you know, that's what Google's thinking It's got.

193
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:18,916
Rym: they do that.

194
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:28,179
Rym: Anyway with the doctors directly Yeah, yeah, but when I would go to the allergist as a kid and it'd be like well I need a new allergy medicine because of whatever.

195
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,304
Rym: Yeah allergist.

196
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:29,565
Rym: Luckily.

197
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:30,529
Rym: She was smart about it.

198
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:35,105
Rym: She would be like you want to take whatever like back when lorata Dean was kind of new.

199
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:38,589
Rym: and they're like here you can take Lorata Dean and I was like, what's that?

200
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,850
Rym: And she's like, well here is enough free samples to make it for the next three months.

201
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:47,927
Rym: And it was like three different brands of drugs, but it didn't matter because they're all the same thing.

202
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:50,622
Scott: Yeah So here's is what they have to say.

203
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:58,870
Scott: They say there are no Current blueprints to open the site to advertising and right now we will never sell user data.

204
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,554
Rym: All right I can translate that.

205
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:11,619
Rym: we have built in all the capability we need to sell Advertising and we plan to shortly Just not right away cuz that you won't sign up.

206
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,907
Scott: we get you to sign up when there's no ads.

207
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:15,849
Rym: then we put the ads I might sign up anyway.

208
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:19,382
Rym: Because here's there's one saving grace to all.

209
00:13:19,402 --> 00:13:25,655
Scott: I think the only problem with it is, you know They don't have you have to get your records in from all the medical places You've been.

210
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:31,126
Scott: that's tough because I that's tough Especially if they haven't if there's a place that hasn't signed in with the with the probe.

211
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:32,090
Rym: Well, no, it's tougher for me.

212
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:36,887
Rym: I haven't had a primary care practitioner since I was in high school.

213
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:38,680
Scott: I Didn't?

214
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:38,844
Scott: I?

215
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:43,492
Scott: you know I haven't had one since I was in high school and I didn't know which one to pick cuz it's like you moved to a New place.

216
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:44,456
Scott: you don't know the doctors.

217
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:47,650
Scott: So I just sort of picked the doctor down the street, right?

218
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,706
Scott: You know and I went to see him once and he was a little.

219
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:50,230
Scott: he was okay.

220
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:53,070
Rym: See, I've just I'm pretty much in good health.

221
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,200
Rym: So I actually didn't get physicals or anything at RIT.

222
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,117
Rym: just cuz I was kind of poor and while I had health insurance I didn't have like it was.

223
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,579
Rym: it was down to the point of well if I drive to a doctor That's like three dollars worth of gas.

224
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,887
Rym: I could buy a lunch with that.

225
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:14,309
Rym: Yep But you know, I finally when I worked at the hospital They're like you got to get tested for tuberculosis.

226
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,910
Rym: Cuz they were you know, the hospital in the inner city and then they gave me a full physical.

227
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:19,705
Rym: That was the first physical I'd had in forever.

228
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:22,981
Rym: Yep But I just I don't go to the doctor like ever.

229
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:25,794
Rym: the last time I went to a doctor is when I cut my finger Halfway off.

230
00:14:26,135 --> 00:14:26,638
Scott: All right.

231
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:31,340
Rym: Yeah, actually go right you went to the doctor after yeah I went to a doctor and then I gave up and went home.

232
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:40,247
Rym: and then the next day I went to a doctor and He's like good God Here's some iodine Soap that Seriously, did you go to the emergency room?

233
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,962
Rym: Iodine so soap - he was like, why didn't you go to the emergency room?

234
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:44,805
Rym: I was like I did.

235
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:45,950
Rym: then I left.

236
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,230
Rym: He was like, ah, well, that is a really bad hospital.

237
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:51,761
Rym: Of course when I asked well, what hospital should I go to?

238
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,390
Rym: he said and this area?

239
00:14:53,390 --> 00:15:01,409
Scott: Yeah Great Google Health can make the Google Hospital.

240
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:06,330
Rym: Alright, I think we can't talk any more about this.

241
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,157
Scott: I think now we can.

242
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:07,803
Scott: we got to stop.

243
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:08,590
Rym: next Monday.

244
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:10,880
Rym: Our show will be is Google evil?

245
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,270
Scott: yet now you want to do a whole Google evil show.

246
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,013
Rym: I think we need to.

247
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,101
Scott: I think you should a general more privacy show.

248
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:17,547
Rym: I don't know privacy is even.

249
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:21,103
Rym: oh god I have a. I have so many things in my delicious about privacy.

250
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:22,831
Rym: I've been saving for a privacy show News.

251
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:24,536
Rym: All right listeners.

252
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,566
Rym: Do you want privacy or Google next week?

253
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:28,870
Rym: Well, I'll make it.

254
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,352
Rym: I'll even make.

255
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:31,138
Rym: we'll make a stupid up there similar.

256
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:39,250
Rym: You can just vote privacy Google or you don't care Alright, so in other news this this this has been making the rounds.

257
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:39,753
Rym: It's very.

258
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:47,326
Rym: this is one of those things where a lot of people will look at it And I guess not understanding the issues make a much bigger deal out of it than it probably is.

259
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,718
Rym: but at the same time It's one of those.

260
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,770
Rym: it's both very Unsurprising and very surprising at the same time.

261
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:05,489
Rym: Apparently a full 20% of US citizens have never used email in their entire lives and a majority of them don't plan to ever.

262
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:09,290
Scott: Well, there's a probably, you know about 20% of people are old people.

263
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,376
Scott: That's that makes sense.

264
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:13,896
Scott: or you know people who live in the middle of nowhere like, you know What.

265
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,789
Scott: so what are the people who live in those arcs?

266
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:20,265
Rym: Yeah, but it's just that the article actually doesn't say a lot.

267
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:21,510
Rym: it links to a bunch of other articles.

268
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:27,377
Rym: But the the gist of this is that there are two Demographics of people who are not connected.

269
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:31,730
Rym: The first one obviously is old people and people who live in the middle of nowhere.

270
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:37,150
Rym: Well, no, no old people in general just don't use new technology, even though it might be better for them in many ways.

271
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,170
Rym: There's a lot of reasons and you can't say oh, well, they're bad or anything.

272
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:47,941
Rym: It's just that's the way it is, but there's a much more Interesting a quote age and education are factors in the divide.

273
00:16:48,483 --> 00:17:08,270
Rym: one half of those who have never used email or over 65 but 56% of the people who don't use email have never had any schooling beyond high school if they even graduated high school uh-huh, and The scary part of these findings is now I'm super generalizing these results like times a billion.

274
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:11,470
Rym: So take this with a big ol grain of salt.

275
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:20,939
Rym: But it seems like half the people who don't use email or who are generally disconnected from the modern Technological society are old people and that's to be expected.

276
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:23,346
Rym: The other half are not old.

277
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:24,710
Rym: In fact, many of them are young.

278
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:33,690
Rym: They're just so Disconnected from society either due to poverty or due to geography or due to language barriers.

279
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:36,404
Rym: I mean illegal immigrants definitely play a big part of that.

280
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:40,180
Scott: I think well the counting Immigrants here the only counting US citizens.

281
00:17:40,381 --> 00:17:42,130
Rym: See I'm not a hundred percent sure.

282
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:43,174
Scott: This is the problem.

283
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:52,251
Scott: See this would be a lot more useful if they correlated the data with some other data For example, but yeah, how many people I worked for the census in 2000?

284
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,838
Rym: I worked for the US federal census.

285
00:17:53,898 --> 00:18:08,041
Rym: My first job I ever had was for the federal government and The problem we had was that the people we sense to very poor areas like to the ghettos and to the slums met pretty much the people who need to be counted the most.

286
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:12,924
Rym: the people who need the most help and the government needs to know About so we can figure out where to put the money in.

287
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:19,728
Rym: the social programs are the ones who hide from the census because they're afraid of being deported or they don't understand what the census is.

288
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:27,370
Rym: or even if They are legal citizens They don't understand the census and they're afraid when someone with a federal badge shows up that they're knocking.

289
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:29,424
Rym: They don't even know the US has a census.

290
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:37,909
Rym: Yeah, and It's very difficult to get useful statistics from the people in America who need the most help as a result.

291
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:39,281
Scott: No, you know at that.

292
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,832
Scott: see if you don't have an education It's very.

293
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:47,890
Scott: you need the most help and you make it as hard as possible for anyone to help you and you only hurt yourself.

294
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:57,610
Rym: But at the same time because there's such a hostile I mean look at illegal immigrants in particular Because the environment in the US in the places where they tend to live are so hostile toward them.

295
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,315
Rym: Anyway, and the political climate.

296
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:15,050
Rym: there is a lot of pressure on them to the point that they won't go to the doctor even when they need treatment because they're afraid of being deported when I Don't think anyone could make the argument that we got citizen or no if you need medical treatment You should get medical treatment.

297
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:27,894
Rym: We might we might get a deal with the problem of why you're in illegal or why you have like why you're in this situation In the first place, but getting someone the medical treatment is probably better for society than not giving it to them Regardless of who pays the

298
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:29,118
Scott: emergency room.

299
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:39,288
Scott: Well, if they're actually not gonna just make you wait all night You know if they're actually going to fix you, you know If you're having a heart attack, they save you first to then ask questions later.

300
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:43,370
Scott: Trust me They're not looking for your ID until you know, you're sure you're not dead.

301
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:53,450
Rym: But this is this is another complicated issue that probably deserves and I'll show entirely but Ponder the fact that one out of five Americans has never used an email ever.

302
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:55,838
Scott: Yeah, I still I'm.

303
00:19:55,979 --> 00:20:02,224
Scott: I think that the people who aren't the old people I think a lot of those people also you would find that they have no TV.

304
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:03,810
Scott: No telephone, you know, they're very well.

305
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,670
Scott: There is an interesting quote, you know people like Amish people.

306
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:08,549
Scott: You know that sort of thing.

307
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:14,199
Rym: Well, yeah I don't know if they got the Amish people because the way they surveyed I don't know if Amish people would have been gotten.

308
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,688
Scott: well pause who knows.

309
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:26,794
Rym: but Many people just don't see a reason to use computers and do not associate Technology with the needs and demands of their daily lives and I think this really because again old people You know the half of these people.

310
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:31,469
Rym: that kind of makes sense, but on the other spectrum, I think there's a lot of people who?

311
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:39,065
Rym: Because their lives are so disconnected from the modern technological world they don't need computers in their daily lives.

312
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:42,950
Rym: and I Feel I don't think this situation is going to get better.

313
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,516
Rym: I think it's going.

314
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,829
Rym: I feel like this Divide is just going to get worse over time, but I don't know what to do.

315
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:56,496
Scott: I'd I think will be a month There'll be a much bigger gap But I think most people are gonna be on this side of the gap and not on the other side At first I don't know.

316
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:57,219
Rym: in the long run.

317
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,830
Rym: I mean worldwide it's much more difficult issue.

318
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:04,250
Rym: But even in the US there are a lot of people who are completely off the radar.

319
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:07,783
Scott: Yeah, yeah a lot of them put themselves there.

320
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:08,607
Scott: it's it's tough call.

321
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:16,449
Scott: yeah I'll be more interesting and say 20 years when you know old people, you know, the old people will be people who like us.

322
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,149
Rym: Anyway things of the day.

323
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,858
Rym: So if you want to go first check this shit out, right?

324
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:28,500
Rym: I'm checking.

325
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:38,040
Scott: so a guy took a Whole bunch of programs and he stuck them together right to check out these programs that he stuck together.

326
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:44,150
Scott: He took the MySQL and he took the integrated taxonomic information system.

327
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,654
Scott: combine those two, right?

328
00:21:46,216 --> 00:21:47,800
Scott: He took some PHP and some pearl.

329
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:54,680
Scott: He took the HMM toolkit from Cambridge, which is a mathematical engine that generates acoustic models.

330
00:21:55,484 --> 00:22:06,608
Scott: He took Julius a voice recognition engine audacity or a quarter an audio recorder, right a Lexicon guide for phenom structure.

331
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:17,410
Scott: I think he used the British English example pronunciations Vox forge utilities, right which allowed it to build the acoustic model that the the mathematical engine would you know go at.

332
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:22,819
Scott: and Then festival which is a thing that you know takes text and then you know Reads it out.

333
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,860
Scott: Like if you I've used festive festivals the only one festival in my sequel the audacity fun fungus festival, right?

334
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:41,320
Scott: Festival audacity in my sequel, I guess PHP are the only ones of these I've used before and Festival is sort of like a text-to-speech program for it's open source and it works really well.

335
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,549
Scott: Like you could type in like hi, how are you doing?

336
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,203
Scott: And then I think like this British dude will say hi How are you doing?

337
00:22:48,223 --> 00:22:52,020
Rym: I guess that now is the worst British accent I've ever heard.

338
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,564
Scott: I didn't say I did I didn't use a British accent in the voice I Britain.

339
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:00,297
Rym: sorry, sorry Albion, but I believe what you meant is.

340
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:08,085
Scott: Oh So It's pretty amazing.

341
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:19,436
Scott: so he combined all these things and what he did is He basically made a thing where you can talk To my sequel and then the results will be read back to you.

342
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:22,940
Rym: So wait select star fraud.

343
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:25,038
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

344
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:32,240
Scott: Huh pretty crazy stuff here and it's it's people wanted you know us to do a show that was technologically complex.

345
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:43,160
Scott: Well, I didn't explain this particular thing in a technologically complex way But if you go to this page and read it, you will need technological knowledges to understand what is being said on this page.

346
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,629
Rym: So it's been a while since we've used a TED talk as a thing of the day But this one bears mention this one.

347
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,458
Rym: This is very interesting because it's a confluence of many things.

348
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:56,170
Rym: I like particularly crows.

349
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,612
Rym: I Really really like.

350
00:23:58,753 --> 00:23:59,740
Rym: I mean I like birds in general.

351
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,470
Rym: I grew up and I had a from when I was very young my parents.

352
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:19,117
Rym: we had an african-grade parrot dusty who is smarter now than a lot of people I knew in high school, but I crows for people who aren't familiar with crows or haven't dealt with them in their daily lives are Super super intelligent like they are.

353
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:24,358
Rym: People think like oh parrots are really smart, but crows are equally smart in many ways.

354
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:29,416
Scott: Yeah, I mean Crows are you know, they're not like human smart, but you know.

355
00:24:29,496 --> 00:24:30,481
Scott: or dolphin smart I mean

356
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:36,862
Rym: if you if you doubted look at all the videos of crows spontaneously making tools and using those tools to do things Yeah,

357
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:46,267
Scott: but crows are no slouches and I you know There is you know, maybe it's crows can't talk only because they don't have the the bits to talk, you know Who knows

358
00:24:46,732 --> 00:24:47,540
Rym: but anyway?

359
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:59,380
Rym: Joshua Klein did a TED presentation and I'm gonna summarize a lot because really you gotta watch this video and the video says it All and the video is again like every TED video eloquent and perfect and amazing.

360
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,193
Scott: We're gonna start watching some more TED videos again.

361
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:08,539
Rym: I haven't watched him a while But the idea here though that the shallow idea is that he made a crow vending machine and crows used it.

362
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:15,156
Scott: Yeah, he said when Rym told me this story, but first I thought it was bending machine and I was like crow bending like crow bar.

363
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:21,433
Scott: Well crow vending machine as in you know, put money in.

364
00:25:21,494 --> 00:25:28,940
Rym: chips come out but potato chips I mean well peanuts actually in this yummy, but the way and he explains how the whole thing worked.

365
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:35,260
Rym: But the idea is much deeper than that that the crow vending machine for peanuts was just the proof of concept.

366
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:37,347
Rym: It was the simplest most basic.

367
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:41,040
Rym: like look this idea is possible.

368
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:43,910
Rym: Here's the simplest proof I could do in a hurry.

369
00:25:44,372 --> 00:25:45,195
Rym: We should look into this.

370
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:46,520
Scott: crows actually vend.

371
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:48,233
Scott: Yes, where they get quarters from.

372
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:49,059
Rym: they found them.

373
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:52,931
Scott: It was actually a money collection machine for him.

374
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:55,980
Scott: He's basically selling peanuts for a quarter ripping off the crows.

375
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,452
Scott: Well, it is a bad deal.

376
00:25:57,714 --> 00:25:58,380
Scott: How smart are they?

377
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,647
Scott: They don't know the words of a quarter.

378
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:03,178
Rym: to get it to go and make sure they did it He spread quarters around the area.

379
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:09,925
Rym: but anyway, the idea here that the gist of it is that Just a lot.

380
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:20,479
Rym: today there are a lot of species in the world that aren't Adapting so well to the fact that humans exist or the world is changing and climate and all that and we spend a lot of time Trying to protect these species.

381
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:34,236
Rym: But at the same time the species that have adapted really well or the ones that are living Kind of side by side with humans and are just they're dealing with it We we tend to look at them as pests and try to destroy them and get away.

382
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:35,019
Rym: We don't care about you.

383
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,261
Rym: Everyone hates The ones.

384
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:37,528
Scott: yeah pigeons crows and rats.

385
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,066
Scott: I think part of the reason that we tend to get rid of them is because they're ugly and people like the cutest crows aren't Ugly and rats are really cute.

386
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,672
Rym: Even city rats are pretty cute.

387
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:48,776
Scott: No, not really.

388
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:49,379
Scott: Yeah, they are.

389
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,076
Scott: They're all like ratata.

390
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:57,896
Rym: They're like But or where even worse radicated all right, okay does not a good Pokemon?

391
00:26:57,936 --> 00:27:03,220
Rym: no, it's not it's ugly Vg cats the rat morning star anyway.

392
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:07,503
Rym: So but his idea is that Crow.

393
00:27:07,523 --> 00:27:08,750
Rym: look at crows in particular.

394
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:14,916
Rym: crows have adapted to dealing with humans to a degree that is almost frightening.

395
00:27:15,337 --> 00:27:27,398
Rym: they and Despite the fact that we keep trying to eliminate them and keep them away they don't go away and almost all the crows in the world live within five miles of a human settlement and all this sort of stuff and They're doing pretty well because they're super smart.

396
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:48,420
Rym: So his idea is Instead of trying to destroy the species that have actually despite us trying to get rid of them Coexisted and not gone away as opposed to the species that we're trying to protect that are going away anyway What if we use this or train them or come up with a way to have an actual mutually beneficial?

397
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,904
Rym: Arrangement and his ideas are far-fetched.

398
00:27:50,924 --> 00:27:54,010
Rym: like we can train crows to bring us money in exchange for food.

399
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:57,559
Scott: Well, I can get mad rich if I had some train crow.

400
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,109
Scott: remember coin bad angry fuck.

401
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,709
Rym: I promise to protect children.

402
00:28:05,014 --> 00:28:06,327
Scott: You can make that you think of the day.

403
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:06,630
Scott: god.

404
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:07,736
Rym: No That's like the.

405
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:08,341
Rym: that's one of the.

406
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:14,845
Rym: that was like After all your base that tried to be the next all your base and it failed to a degree.

407
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:15,587
Rym: That is epic.

408
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:18,943
Scott: Yeah It was the thing of the day.

409
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:21,429
Scott: once it was yours I did lobster magnet on the same day.

410
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:25,886
Rym: Because if you've got a lobster and you've got a magnet did it it it it it it.

411
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:28,249
Rym: it lobster has antenna But don't you grab it?

412
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:36,685
Rym: Okay so You could train crows and basically pay them to do things and they're smart enough.

413
00:28:36,986 --> 00:28:42,210
Rym: So and their work for peanuts Ha but seriously like his ideas and he just threw him out there.

414
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:48,410
Rym: Like what if after like you train crows in the city to after a parade or in a stadium after a game?

415
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:52,207
Scott: To pick up all the garbage, I don't think they like ticker tape.

416
00:28:52,227 --> 00:28:52,890
Scott: It doesn't taste good.

417
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:57,567
Rym: No, no, you train them to bring the garbage to a place in exchange for food.

418
00:28:57,587 --> 00:29:05,002
Scott: I could just I'm just getting visions of like, you know Movie where the evil guy has like the army of crows.

419
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:10,885
Rym: I'm getting visions of hey, they're following the School getting attacked by murders of crows for their change.

420
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:11,729
Scott: Oh, man.

421
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:15,530
Scott: But seriously at the bigger crow army, it'll be really Pokemon.

422
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:16,092
Scott: Everyone.

423
00:29:16,132 --> 00:29:17,095
Scott: I'd like these crow armies.

424
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:21,330
Rym: my crows are power powerful or just like that Simpsons where Homer has the flock of crows.

425
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:22,900
Rym: No, you go.

426
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,087
Scott: Oh my flag of seagulls.

427
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:24,369
Scott: I win.

428
00:29:25,532 --> 00:29:29,870
Rym: But Martin, he's like no honey a flock of crows is called a murder.

429
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:37,777
Rym: But this videos because it's a cool idea that It's possible to have an you can.

430
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:42,870
Rym: we can have a relationship with smart animals where we pay them for goods and services directly.

431
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,090
Rym: I mean we kind of have it with like horses.

432
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,724
Rym: They pull us around in return oat bag.

433
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:57,284
Rym: I get my oat bag Salt Lake, but the video is fascinating and very well done.

434
00:29:57,424 --> 00:29:58,890
Rym: and that's all I have to say about that.

435
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:10,650
Scott: Yeah, the only thing I have to say about that that I didn't say already is that I'll agree I'll go with him on the on the mammals and bird type, you know creatures that have you know lived with the humans.

436
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:13,945
Rym: Hey, we could see cucumbers and need some more love.

437
00:30:14,006 --> 00:30:22,689
Scott: I'm talking about You know There are other creatures that have lived very close to humans and done very well that we do not want to have working for us.

438
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:25,318
Scott: May I point out the mosquito?

439
00:30:25,338 --> 00:30:28,569
Rym: Ah, but the mosquito we've dealt with where we live.

440
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:33,030
Scott: you are You train the mosquitoes and I will spray you with mosquitoes, right?

441
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:37,156
Rym: Well mosquitoes aren't so smart.

442
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:40,130
Scott: no, not really well, they're really smart.

443
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,830
Scott: They're smarter than vampires.

444
00:30:44,952 --> 00:30:47,430
Rym: No, I think vampires have the edge anyway.

445
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:55,083
Scott: So today we've gotten mad Requests to do like high-tech talk.

446
00:30:55,123 --> 00:30:59,499
Scott: that was not dumbed down in any way And I don't know how well this is gonna go.

447
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:06,978
Scott: I can already hear people turning off their iPods up there goes But some of our listeners want it and we've never really done it.

448
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:18,970
Scott: We've always hesitated to do it and For me I have like a natural tendency to always like explain things if I don't think someone is understanding what I'm saying

449
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:24,928
Rym: Especially because like we're at the point now where Scott is very specialized in what he does I'm very specialized in what I do.

450
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:35,210
Rym: So my depth of knowledge in IT is well beyond Scott's but Scott's depth of knowledge in programming is well beyond mine So we even have to like I have to pull back a little bit and he has to pull back.

451
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:40,889
Scott: Yeah, like I the only person I explained what I'm gonna explain today too was Alex because I didn't think Rym would get it.

452
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,414
Scott: So Yeah, we both decided.

453
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:46,719
Scott: Well, what are we gonna talk about?

454
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,630
Scott: That's really really in-depth technology.

455
00:31:49,710 --> 00:32:00,563
Scott: That's not dumbed down in any way and I you know, all I could think of that was recent was this Ubuntu bug I submitted and Rym was gonna talk about the NTP problems.

456
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:01,890
Scott: He was having with VMware at work.

457
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,660
Rym: Yeah, I'm basically we both just picked something we can talk about.

458
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,413
Rym: This is not really a throwaway episode but more of a Word.

459
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:09,822
Rym: we're not gonna mince words.

460
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:10,969
Rym: We're not gonna hold back.

461
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,540
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like let's just talk about some technology issue.

462
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:39,850
Scott: that's cool, you know fresh on our minds and Personal to us so that we can you know, because then we know all the details of it, you know it's not something we read about something we did and Explain it and you know not dumbed down terms in any way whatsoever just on someone, you know Explain it to someone who has the same technical knowledge, you know that on our level and see what the listener reaction to that is

463
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:47,263
Rym: Well, the tricky thing is though if I was talking to another enterprise IT expert I would say the VMware timekeeping problem and they would go.

464
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:47,845
Rym: Oh, yeah.

465
00:32:48,226 --> 00:32:49,210
Rym: Yeah, and that's the end of it.

466
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:57,846
Scott: I know that that is the problem, but I figure I'll try to explain it to Rym Basically, and I'll try to explain my thing to Scott and I already know about your thing.

467
00:32:58,147 --> 00:32:58,669
Rym: Oh, do you?

468
00:33:00,954 --> 00:33:11,449
Rym: But because basically the idea here is If this works or anyone out there if you feel that this is the proper level we can do Actual shows just at this level.

469
00:33:12,553 --> 00:33:25,042
Scott: Yeah, it all that We're is mostly even if you don't like this episode just listen to it to help us out to you know Tell us if you understood it or not or if you enjoyed it whether regardless of whether you understood it completely it'll

470
00:33:25,062 --> 00:33:31,183
Rym: also give you a tiny idea of if you're if you're Into computers you want to go into IT or CS because you'll hear

471
00:33:31,223 --> 00:33:34,556
Scott: about some - mine isn't really a program No, it's a Linux issue.

472
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:37,508
Rym: Well, if you want to if you want to grow a neck beard, right?

473
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:42,817
Scott: Yeah, this is mine is serious neck beard action, let me tell you All right.

474
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:43,829
Scott: So do you want me to go first?

475
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,589
Scott: Go right because you keep pausing like you want me to go first.

476
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:47,213
Rym: That's cuz.

477
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:52,981
Rym: I really got a burp and I was waiting for you to get going so I can burp burp away Alright, so check out this problem.

478
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:53,787
Scott: I'm having it work.

479
00:33:53,827 --> 00:33:59,450
Scott: See Why don't my development development server connect to it via SSH, right?

480
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:05,490
Scott: But to make things easier, I'd rather use G VIM on the local machine then use VIM in the terminal.

481
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:10,010
Scott: You know when I'm SSH to the remote machine because then G VIM has a much better interface.

482
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,969
Scott: I can make the window bigger better fonts, right?

483
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:17,270
Rym: Well, I even have the problem where I work on a lot of different servers and some of them aren't set up.

484
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:26,922
Scott: So well, yeah Now the dev server is a BSD is a free BSD and there's no X on it because it doesn't need X. You know installed on there right not installed at all.

485
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:33,074
Rym: No, there's no X is no X lives It's not like are super important like trading like whatever servers We don't like.

486
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:36,130
Rym: no one runs an X terminal but X is installed.

487
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:42,899
Rym: So if I'm SSH 10 and I got to do something like I can run an X program even though I just have a shell Yeah, so I got no X forwarding right.

488
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:45,070
Scott: so I have to use the G VIM on my local box.

489
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,697
Scott: I can't you know X forward G VIM from the server.

490
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,167
Scott: So my only option is I can.

491
00:34:51,467 --> 00:35:02,410
Scott: I can either Check out the code repositories to my local machine work there and then push the files back to the dev server Where I would you know could look at them in a web browser or whatever.

492
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:04,839
Scott: That's a huge pain in the ass right.

493
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:07,590
Scott: copying all these files back and forth screw that shit, right?

494
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,630
Scott: So how am I supposed to get G VIM to open up the remote files in the dev server?

495
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,247
Scott: The answer is I have to use some sort of intermediary.

496
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:18,690
Scott: the intermediary But I was using was Nautilus in gnome.

497
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:29,672
Scott: You know the file manager because it using it used to use this gnome VFS system to basically turn the SSH SFTP connection into a virtual file system Right.

498
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:35,590
Scott: so I could open up Nautilus and be browsing the files on the remote machine and I could right-click on the files.

499
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,570
Rym: I feel like I would have set up a Samba share, but then again Samba Samba.

500
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:44,356
Scott: Even if I did a Samba share, I would have to do the same thing with gnome VFS I right through Nautilus.

501
00:35:44,617 --> 00:35:48,529
Scott: so I go through there right click on the file and I would say open in.

502
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,810
Scott: you know Like G edit which is the gnome text editor.

503
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:57,649
Scott: And then what it actually does using gnome VFS is it just launches G edit and passes on.

504
00:35:57,669 --> 00:35:59,969
Scott: you know the command-line argument of.

505
00:36:00,412 --> 00:36:12,070
Scott: You know the the whole as cuz G edit knows how to take SSH Command line arguments so we could open something over the connection on its own Right, but G VIM doesn't know what the hell to do with that, right?

506
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:20,490
Scott: So I actually in the old version of Ubuntu prior to Hardy Heron I had a script that I was a special open with G VIM script.

507
00:36:20,952 --> 00:36:24,989
Scott: the thing is that was very annoying because saving and loading were extremely slow.

508
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:30,245
Scott: in The new Ubuntu they replaced gnome VFS with G VFS.

509
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:38,371
Scott: that combines with fuse Right and the thing about fuse because Linux only a root user can mount a file system and run mount a file system Right.

510
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:44,810
Scott: So how are you supposed to get a real mount of a remote file of any kind of file system?

511
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,330
Scott: If you're not root and you don't want to become root and you don't want to share it with anyone?

512
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,429
Scott: So they've got this fuse system now, that's really hot.

513
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:55,423
Scott: So what you can do now because they're using G VFS and fuse instead of gnome VFS.

514
00:36:55,704 --> 00:37:06,310
Scott: when you mount something in Nautilus with the with the virtual file system It actually does a what is a saying effectively a real mount in your dot G VFS folder in your home directory.

515
00:37:06,872 --> 00:37:17,210
Scott: Thus when I go into Nautilus and I right-click on the file and I say open in G VIM It actually opens up as far as it's concerned a local file and the fuse and G VFS take care of all the SSH stuff.

516
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:23,848
Scott: So I can actually work on remote files on the local machine in G VIM without exporting and without bullshit.

517
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:26,636
Scott: now What is the bug here?

518
00:37:26,817 --> 00:37:31,170
Scott: And why did I submit this bug to the Ubuntu bug reporting?

519
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:42,070
Scott: So if I go to the other machine right on it in the terminal and I check the permissions on one of the code files I'm working on right the permissions are 644, which is what they should be, right?

520
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:53,590
Scott: If I open the file up right through the Nautilus G VFS fuse with G edit which is the gnome text editor and I save them the permissions don't change whatsoever.

521
00:37:54,435 --> 00:38:09,859
Scott: Now if I do an LSL on the remote server They're 644, but if I do the permission if I check the permissions in the local, you know, virtual file system every directory is 700 and Every single file is 600.

522
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:10,983
Scott: There is no changing that.

523
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:11,906
Scott: you can't change it.

524
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:13,010
Scott: You can't do anything about it.

525
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:18,443
Scott: That's the way it is Which makes sense because you don't want other people on the same machine as you.

526
00:38:18,904 --> 00:38:25,670
Scott: looking at the files that you virtually mounted Right, you know you only want the person who actually mounted it and root to be able to get in there.

527
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:33,645
Scott: Otherwise like I would SSH into a server Mount it with fuse and then you know you SSH into my computer and then boot.

528
00:38:33,665 --> 00:38:35,370
Scott: you're in my SSH on this other computer.

529
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:37,218
Scott: You don't have the credentials for that, but you're in.

530
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:38,223
Scott: that's no good.

531
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:39,830
Scott: So it's actually correct.

532
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:47,030
Scott: The problem is is that vim and also g vim when they save they modify the permissions.

533
00:38:47,815 --> 00:38:52,862
Scott: Now for some reason if you try to own One of the files in the virtual file system.

534
00:38:52,902 --> 00:38:54,590
Scott: It just says hey Jones not supported.

535
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:59,684
Scott: But if you chmod what actually happens is it schmods the file.

536
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:03,336
Scott: not in the virtual file system Which I already said it goes unchanged.

537
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:07,070
Scott: it schmods the file in the real file system on the remote machine.

538
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:12,130
Scott: So when I save a file in vim in g vim that I'm going through this.

539
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,935
Scott: You know g VFS fuse system.

540
00:39:14,476 --> 00:39:30,429
Scott: on the remote machine the permissions get changed to 600 because as far as g vim is concerned the permissions Are 600 so it saves them and schmods to 600. so now it's no longer 644. in the real file system It's 600 and the web server can't read it because it doesn't have permission to read it.

541
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:34,904
Scott: And I have to go and SSH on the command line anyway to change permissions back.

542
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:41,829
Scott: and now it's more of a pain in the ass To edit with g vim than to just SSH in the terminal and edit normally score one Yes.

543
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:48,550
Scott: So it's a huge huge pain in the ass and I submitted the bug to Ubuntu because who knows where this bug is, right?

544
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,514
Scott: How do you fix this bug?

545
00:39:49,835 --> 00:39:53,830
Scott: Do you change fuse and g VFS that the permissions are different locally?

546
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:55,615
Scott: I don't think that's a good idea.

547
00:39:55,655 --> 00:39:57,220
Scott: that raises all sorts security issues.

548
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,150
Scott: Like I just talked about do you change g vim?

549
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,840
Scott: Or vim so that they don't schmod when you save?

550
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:07,992
Scott: well, that's not a bad idea because I mean no other text editor I know of does that.

551
00:40:08,353 --> 00:40:20,370
Scott: but the problem is maybe someone out there has some other application that expects g vim and vim to change Permissions on save and thus that will cause a bug somewhere else and you fix this bug.

552
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,049
Scott: It could be an expected permission somewhere else and I had to submit that bug to g vim not to Ubuntu.

553
00:40:26,434 --> 00:40:27,880
Scott: Or maybe it's a Nautilus problem.

554
00:40:28,141 --> 00:40:30,490
Scott: but good but I did actually try it without going through Nautilus.

555
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:35,310
Scott: I just you know changed directory to dot g VFS and went direct and the things still happen.

556
00:40:37,373 --> 00:40:39,764
Scott: So I have no idea what the appropriate fix for this bug is.

557
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:41,029
Scott: I could think of a few.

558
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:47,370
Scott: Some guys started to help me out and then he sort of realized what the problem was and he's just like oh, yeah.

559
00:40:47,772 --> 00:40:50,423
Scott: And then some other guy is like for what it's worth.

560
00:40:50,443 --> 00:40:52,250
Scott: I am also experiencing this behavior.

561
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,730
Scott: This has already caused a few problems for deploying fixes to clients.

562
00:40:56,151 --> 00:41:02,473
Scott: So he must have clients where he SSH is into their servers and fixes things for them and he's going through the same system I'm going through.

563
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:08,148
Scott: and but when he saves now all of a sudden he breaks his clients web pages because he changed the permissions on all the files.

564
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,516
Scott: so Yeah, did anyone understand that?

565
00:41:11,897 --> 00:41:12,399
Rym: Oh, I don't know.

566
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:14,487
Rym: At least you get the comfort of nothing is more.

567
00:41:14,507 --> 00:41:15,410
Scott: Did you understand that Rym?

568
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,209
Rym: Yeah All right.

569
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:17,430
Rym: Nothing is scarier though.

570
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:25,582
Rym: Then when you run into a problem like that and you go online and there's no reference to that problem anywhere else in the world Yeah, I've had that happen a couple times.

571
00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:26,850
Scott: That's when you make the bug reports.

572
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:32,913
Scott: It's funny though, because if I do like if I do gedit like, you know Cuz g edit.

573
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:36,710
Scott: g vim now actually supports like, you know, like SFTP.

574
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:50,767
Scott: So if I on the command line if I do g vim SFTP Scott at remote machine slash home slash code slash file dot text Alright, if I do it that way g vim itself is going.

575
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:58,430
Scott: g vim All right is handling the SSH and SFTP and it doesn't fuck up the permissions because it's direct to the remote file system.

576
00:41:58,892 --> 00:42:09,092
Scott: But if I do g vim space dot g VFS slash, you know You know server slash code whatever then it screws everything up because you know It.

577
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:11,230
Scott: it says what are the permissions on this file?

578
00:42:11,511 --> 00:42:20,191
Scott: The answer is 600. it's chamad 600 and then the fuse passes it on to the real file system and changes the 644 to 600.

579
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:22,540
Scott: Very annoying very very annoying.

580
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:33,890
Rym: Well what I've been dealing with lately and so far I've gotten no answer from VMware has pretty much gotten dark on me and I've talked to some high-up engineers Even though I kind of already know the answer.

581
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,959
Rym: I'm just waiting for someone official to just admit it.

582
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:45,650
Rym: but a lot of you use VMware and People don't really seem to realize that Time in VMS is pretty much completely screwed up.

583
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,214
Scott: Well, the reason for that is you have the.

584
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:55,098
Scott: the only place you can get real-time on a computer is the operating system That is running directly on the CPU.

585
00:42:55,218 --> 00:42:58,530
Scott: every other pro every other piece of software on the computer, right?

586
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:10,163
Scott: Basically begs the operating system for CPU cycles and it's up to the operating system itself to decide which CPU cycles to give to which other applications and when.

587
00:43:10,364 --> 00:43:18,569
Rym: but when you're running in a virtualized environment especially if you're using like a VM server where you've got this server that has I don't know 10 or 20 virtual machines running on it.

588
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:25,210
Rym: Because then you have the problem where everything is ticking along but say for the machines are using a ton of CPU.

589
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:33,719
Rym: So other machines that aren't so heavily loaded right now get d scheduled temporarily so they're not getting CPU cycles at all.

590
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:41,600
Rym: and The problem here is that those machines effectively kind of slow down or stop like there's no amount.

591
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,125
Rym: The time is not accounted for.

592
00:43:43,145 --> 00:43:43,807
Rym: that was missing.

593
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:47,700
Rym: So when they schedule up again now their clock is falling behind.

594
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:57,300
Scott: Yeah See it's not a problem for the software running on those machines because obviously the software doesn't need any cycles But the clock on the machine the time the time will get slow.

595
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,083
Scott: That's not good.

596
00:43:58,183 --> 00:44:08,160
Rym: And that's really not good for any system where time matters I mean logging and that it's an awful awful situation and luckily the worst thing that can ever happen.

597
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:23,836
Rym: It's okay Theoretically if time gets ahead because you'll never have a log entry appear After an entry where it shouldn't have appeared or should have appeared before it because that can screw things up royally Like that can bark your file systems in some cases.

598
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:24,580
Rym: that can just ruin.

599
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,860
Scott: Yeah, you don't want to go open up your log file and it says yes something it happened five o'clock.

600
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:31,087
Scott: Then something else happened at five oh one.

601
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:32,753
Scott: then something else happened at 459.

602
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,516
Scott: Whoa, that's bad.

603
00:44:35,141 --> 00:44:48,360
Rym: But so but before that I mean before virtual machines what I set up a fairly sophisticated NTP which you know network time protocol Environment to get because we need super super accurate time and I looked into those radio receivers.

604
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:49,387
Rym: They actually give you pretty.

605
00:44:49,971 --> 00:44:51,200
Rym: they're not that good overall.

606
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,251
Rym: You're better off just using NTP and syncing to miss.

607
00:44:53,412 --> 00:44:54,839
Scott: NTP is pretty is pretty good.

608
00:44:55,161 --> 00:44:59,960
Rym: NTP is amazing despite the fact that the dude who wrote it is kind of crazy.

609
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,873
Scott: Well, he's just an easy crazy old Linux and Unix Santa Claus guy.

610
00:45:03,974 --> 00:45:07,366
Rym: Yeah, like he predates the neckbeard He has the Unix Santa beard.

611
00:45:07,848 --> 00:45:08,832
Scott: Yeah, I mean that's that.

612
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,640
Scott: that's why Linux guys have the neckbeard.

613
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,001
Scott: They're true.

614
00:45:11,021 --> 00:45:12,286
Scott: They're working their way up to.

615
00:45:12,306 --> 00:45:14,675
Scott: you know, Unix was the full-on Santa Claus.

616
00:45:14,996 --> 00:45:16,180
Scott: Linux is the neckbeard.

617
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:18,567
Scott: So I guess whatever comes next, you know, it's good.

618
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:22,379
Scott: Well Apple is like little goatee, you know and Microsoft is clean-shaven.

619
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:25,489
Rym: And then but don't forget there's the suspenders.

620
00:45:25,729 --> 00:45:30,843
Rym: you're not allowed to wear suspenders unless you're over the age of 60 or Use Unix.

621
00:45:30,883 --> 00:45:33,693
Scott: No, this is the suspenders are not the Unix Santa Claus.

622
00:45:33,713 --> 00:45:35,580
Scott: Is there like the mainframe Santa Clauses?

623
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:43,366
Rym: Ah, I guess some of the old old Unix guys who used to be mainframe guys, maybe Bafa You can't wear suspended.

624
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,692
Rym: Bafa can wear suspenders.

625
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,740
Rym: All right, of course, you only use them to kill someone.

626
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:55,586
Rym: Yeah but Actually setting up that environment because it was the first time I'd worked somewhere where they cared about time and when I said I know NTP there.

627
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:56,469
Rym: They were all excited.

628
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,823
Rym: So I set up this super sophisticated environment and Basically, we need.

629
00:46:01,446 --> 00:46:02,991
Rym: it's not just that I need accurate time.

630
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:05,420
Rym: I need really accurate time.

631
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,126
Scott: I mean with that stock market closes the computers have to say done right now it's not even just that.

632
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:18,200
Rym: but there's regulatory things where like Did not get into the specifics of this because economic knowledge is is somewhat separate from technical knowledge.

633
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:26,595
Rym: But if a true like a trade happens like a stock trade It has to be reported to the relevant agencies within a set amount of time.

634
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:30,237
Rym: or you're basically just fucked like you've got a report when things happen.

635
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:34,391
Rym: and I think right now the rule is you have 90 seconds.

636
00:46:34,431 --> 00:46:37,100
Rym: now we report within like a tenth of a second.

637
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:38,960
Rym: But you have 90 seconds.

638
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,478
Scott: But there's a good chance that's gonna be a computer messes up and saw and like the reporting computer goes.

639
00:46:44,578 --> 00:46:48,095
Scott: Uh-oh Well, you see like let's say the reporting computer goes.

640
00:46:48,376 --> 00:46:49,200
Scott: Oh for like two minutes.

641
00:46:49,361 --> 00:46:56,647
Rym: Well, that's why we have a very sophisticated system with lots of redundancies where that never happened I know but that's that's a big worry right there.

642
00:46:56,708 --> 00:47:00,140
Rym: That's why I'm paid what I am because I remember I'm a production support engineer.

643
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,300
Rym: I work for the revenue generating side of my company.

644
00:47:03,882 --> 00:47:09,920
Rym: My primary mission objective is that there are a set of servers that generate money for the company.

645
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:24,419
Rym: those servers must never Stop working ever and if they do I have to bring them back up and then I have to explain to people who might not Be so technical why they went down and whose fault it was Mm-hmm, and it might be my fault.

646
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:36,480
Rym: So, I mean I got to admit some of the scariest things I do are they say there's a minor problem on the production server or even a little thing Like I gotta do like do something with the firewall on the production server.

647
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,164
Rym: I need to look at the firewall or something.

648
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:45,325
Rym: Anytime I type su - and type in that password that password That.

649
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:46,411
Rym: that's some scary times.

650
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:48,360
Rym: cuz like suddenly I actually have a separate window.

651
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,760
Rym: I have this whole environment of like 10 different X windows with different background colors.

652
00:47:53,424 --> 00:48:00,999
Rym: One of them is red and if I'm in the production server I'm in there and I types I'm like type type a type type type type.

653
00:48:01,521 --> 00:48:04,880
Rym: Sometimes I get like hey, I'm about to type this on the production server.

654
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,348
Rym: I want you to note that I'm typing this right now.

655
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:11,100
Rym: or do you do you have any problems with the update statement?

656
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,320
Rym: I'm typing right now in the SQL database.

657
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:16,088
Scott: Yeah, it's a good one of course.

658
00:48:16,148 --> 00:48:19,557
Rym: actually usually if I typed an update statement between the hours of 9 a.m.

659
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:23,850
Rym: And 4 p.m I'd probably fired on the spot probably but that's that's an aside.

660
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:32,420
Rym: So I actually to get a good time environment I actually had to get three separate NTP servers and I made all of them peer to each other.

661
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:44,140
Rym: So they kind of as a group will decide what the best source of time is and then each one of them I actually made a matrix where it there's a pool of five NTP servers from NIST that they all share.

662
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:49,480
Rym: But then each one of them has four additional NIST sources that are all geographically dispersed.

663
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:54,640
Rym: And actually these three servers tour in New York and one's often like Virginia and I have like this crazy.

664
00:48:55,062 --> 00:48:57,113
Rym: So it's a pretty sophisticated environment.

665
00:48:57,676 --> 00:49:08,539
Rym: and on top of that I had to set up Reporting because I have to verify to the back office and to all the auditors that we have accurate time Not just on these servers, but on all the important servers that connect to them.

666
00:49:09,142 --> 00:49:18,279
Rym: So that was a project in and of itself because I had to actually set up a way to monitor Externally whether or not these servers are synchronized and then how good their sync is.

667
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:23,240
Scott: She's got like what you got your turn on your computer is a list of all the servers and then little clocks next to all.

668
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:25,250
Rym: Actually, no, I'm on.

669
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:26,901
Rym: basically I'm on it I can't.

670
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:31,280
Rym: there's a bunch of ways to do it and I could just grab traps from the NTP services.

671
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,347
Rym: But that's not super reliable.

672
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:35,735
Rym: because what if the NTP server goes down exactly?

673
00:49:35,795 --> 00:49:37,060
Rym: It's not gonna send me a trap.

674
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:42,135
Rym: And also I don't want to trust that at all because track SNMP traps are not.

675
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:48,920
Rym: you can't verify At least with SNMP version 1 which is what the majority people still use that a trap got there.

676
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,604
Rym: There's no like.

677
00:49:49,644 --> 00:49:49,825
Rym: yes.

678
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,817
Rym: I got your trap or huh?

679
00:49:51,897 --> 00:49:53,805
Rym: He didn't Respond to my trap.

680
00:49:53,845 --> 00:49:54,929
Rym: Maybe I should send it again.

681
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:57,940
Rym: And again, what if your server crashes then or hangs?

682
00:49:58,222 --> 00:49:59,079
Rym: You're not gonna get a trap.

683
00:49:59,742 --> 00:50:00,243
Rym: so I've.

684
00:50:00,383 --> 00:50:09,829
Rym: I monitored the root dispersion which is not the amount that the time is off by but the Theoretical maximum possible error that I could have.

685
00:50:10,331 --> 00:50:27,639
Rym: so if I take the root dispersion and add the Differential or the time difference the like the absolute difference I get mathematically the absolute Maximum error that I could have in my time from the quote unquote true time Even though nothing ever actually converges to true time.

686
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,066
Rym: But that's all well and good.

687
00:50:30,086 --> 00:50:34,524
Rym: and I set this crazy thing up and I'm not even get into how I set up the monitoring Cuz I had.

688
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:42,520
Rym: I had to extend the NTP stat and the NTP queue commands Through SNMP in order to be able to pull it for like MRTG and all these things.

689
00:50:43,062 --> 00:50:44,990
Rym: But alright, that's all well and good.

690
00:50:45,693 --> 00:50:47,420
Rym: now we want to run virtual machines.

691
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:55,000
Rym: But virtual machines you can't just run NTP because NTP if it runs into trouble will just crash.

692
00:50:55,582 --> 00:50:56,886
Rym: Like it'll synchronize the clock.

693
00:50:56,967 --> 00:51:00,720
Rym: It'll say whoa, that was off by way too much and it'll silently fail.

694
00:51:01,102 --> 00:51:02,027
Rym: Yep, and that's it.

695
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:02,711
Rym: You're done.

696
00:51:02,731 --> 00:51:04,140
Rym: NTP is not running anymore.

697
00:51:04,963 --> 00:51:07,352
Rym: So I go into all these virtual machines.

698
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:13,089
Rym: I go into one and it is literally Gaining about one to three seconds per second.

699
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,678
Rym: It was like four years into the future when I logged into it.

700
00:51:16,778 --> 00:51:18,244
Scott: Whoa That's great.

701
00:51:18,304 --> 00:51:20,979
Scott: I mean I have VMware's at work, you know, I use them just.

702
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:22,951
Scott: you know It's like look at things in different web browsers.

703
00:51:22,991 --> 00:51:28,680
Scott: This is on an ESX server I know and but they they only get off, you know, they're there they get off a little bit.

704
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:33,040
Scott: But I mean if I suspend one and then bring it back the time will be way way.

705
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:35,790
Rym: Well, you realize are you running VMware workstation or what?

706
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,114
Scott: I'm where you see VMware play ever.

707
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:41,387
Rym: Ah, oh god Your screen can't even run like VMware tools or anything.

708
00:51:41,407 --> 00:51:43,854
Scott: Well, actually it can run VMware tools.

709
00:51:43,895 --> 00:51:45,800
Scott: You just can't install VMware tools.

710
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:52,508
Scott: So if you get an image that has the tools in it, they work, but if you don't have the tool Wait, wait, wait, so how do you know they work?

711
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,300
Scott: because I've downloaded images that have the tools in them.

712
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,153
Rym: Oh, yeah, but how do you know they're doing what?

713
00:51:57,173 --> 00:51:57,898
Rym: because you know what they do?

714
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,041
Scott: Well, it can.

715
00:51:59,262 --> 00:52:01,689
Scott: it can sort of do a shitty time synchronization.

716
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:03,816
Rym: Actually see here's the problem.

717
00:52:04,377 --> 00:52:08,529
Rym: I had to know Exactly how that worked and the documentation didn't say crap.

718
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:14,592
Scott: as from what I can tell it seems that basically all it does is When you turn the virtual machine back on and synchronize the time.

719
00:52:14,773 --> 00:52:19,283
Rym: actually if you edit the config file Especially with like an ESX server We have a lot more options.

720
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:25,922
Rym: You can specify a lot of options and each of these options has varying levels of documentation Related to them.

721
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:35,680
Rym: So what I tried to do is like alright, so I look and I said oh, there's a list of Things I can set to true and on those things those events.

722
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:43,666
Rym: It'll hard sync the clock to whatever the time is which is actually pretty bad because the way NTFE works.

723
00:52:43,686 --> 00:53:05,299
Rym: the important thing is that it's lose the time like if the times off it'll slowly converge on the real time unless it's way off and then it'll jump it once and then slowly converge because you'd rather have a very off but very consistent clock than a Generally very on but very erratic on a low level like a clock That's always accurate to a minute.

724
00:53:05,701 --> 00:53:12,845
Rym: But within that minute the second edge is jumping around left and right which is actually what happens in virtual machines a lot Like if you run.

725
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:17,618
Rym: if you run a clock that has a second hand in a VMware You'll see it jumping around a lot of the time.

726
00:53:18,901 --> 00:53:21,388
Rym: so I Set these options and I told it.

727
00:53:21,468 --> 00:53:30,660
Rym: All right, I want you to synchronize the clock Every five seconds, so I know it'll never be off by more than five seconds in the worst case scenario.

728
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:37,956
Rym: And I want you to sync it anytime the the disk or defrag in the virtual machine or anytime suspended or resumed and all that stuff.

729
00:53:37,976 --> 00:53:42,464
Rym: and It totally didn't do jack Didn't do anything.

730
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:43,026
Rym: Uh-huh.

731
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:46,520
Rym: So I do more reading and it turns out that and this is the tricky part.

732
00:53:47,428 --> 00:54:11,110
Rym: so there are different ways in the kernel to specify how you deal with time and you set the kernel clock and Modern kernels actually are very clever where if the kernel misses a clock tick and I'm not even gonna get into how the clocks work but what it'll do is it'll intelligently figure out how many ticks had missed and Compensate by adding ticks downstream so that the clock will always be kind of accurate.

733
00:54:11,936 --> 00:54:16,530
Rym: But in a virtual machine Those ticks were supposed to be lost.

734
00:54:16,991 --> 00:54:23,550
Rym: So as a result, it synchronizes the clock forward, but then the clock itself knew that it missed some ticks.

735
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:29,770
Rym: So it adds ticks downstream the VMware soft sync thing, which I couldn't find documentation forever.

736
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:33,173
Rym: I got the VMware engineers to send me Documentation.

737
00:54:33,775 --> 00:54:36,403
Rym: it says hey lost ticks blah blah blah.

738
00:54:36,684 --> 00:54:39,399
Rym: I'm gonna make the time speed up a little bit so it catches up.

739
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:46,550
Rym: but then The lost ticks happen again and the clock which is getting faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster.

740
00:54:47,152 --> 00:54:48,335
Rym: So I asked the VMware people.

741
00:54:48,355 --> 00:54:49,097
Rym: Hey, what's the deal?

742
00:54:49,137 --> 00:54:57,662
Rym: And they said oh, it doesn't sink the clock backwards only forwards To which I say alright wise guys.

743
00:54:57,843 --> 00:54:59,309
Rym: So how should I synchronize the time?

744
00:54:59,329 --> 00:54:59,650
Rym: They said.

745
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:07,699
Rym: So what I ended up doing is I set the clock to pit in the kernel Which basically is the dumbest clock you can set.

746
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,947
Rym: Yeah, it ignores if it misses takes.

747
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:10,690
Rym: it doesn't care.

748
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:12,235
Rym: It never tries to catch up.

749
00:55:12,637 --> 00:55:14,483
Rym: It just assumes that the clock takes.

750
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:25,000
Rym: it's getting from the pit timer are perfect Mmm, and then I ran the NTP demon, but I used the tinker settings Which never ever ever mess with.

751
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,090
Scott: the tinker said that's the one the Unix guy hates.

752
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:32,390
Rym: No one wants you to use those settings and you can do some crazy stuff with NTP.

753
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:40,869
Rym: I I had never set those settings before because they're interesting But I was of the mind that there is nothing I could ever do in there that would have a good effect.

754
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:47,819
Rym: But I said this the tinker panic setting to zero Which the end result of that?

755
00:55:47,879 --> 00:55:56,256
Rym: it does a lot of things, but basically it turns off all error checking and all Sanity checking in NTP.

756
00:55:56,837 --> 00:55:59,465
Rym: so NTP will not crash now when the time is bad.

757
00:56:00,047 --> 00:56:02,060
Rym: It'll just keep plugging It'll just set the clock.

758
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:02,948
Rym: It doesn't care.

759
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:11,639
Scott: It's so bad that Unix and if he finds you just slit your throat at night, but at the same time The VMware seemed accurate.

760
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,683
Rym: now, they're not getting ahead.

761
00:56:12,723 --> 00:56:14,790
Rym: They're not getting behind because I got the clocks at the pit.

762
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:21,190
Rym: I turned off the VMware tools bullshit time saying and I'm running NTP with this tinker panic to my good.

763
00:56:21,332 --> 00:56:28,073
Rym: I know the time is good But now I have this very difficult problem and I'm being asked by people who want to.

764
00:56:28,173 --> 00:56:32,667
Rym: they want to be able to say to non-technical like auditors that the time is accurate to verify it.

765
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,309
Rym: and The time is pretty accurate.

766
00:56:35,911 --> 00:56:37,776
Rym: But how do I verify?

767
00:56:37,836 --> 00:56:43,089
Rym: because what can I compare the time on an unreliable time server to?

768
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,508
Rym: Within it's the context of itself.

769
00:56:46,632 --> 00:56:54,690
Rym: So now I wrote this script that is basically Sorting through VAR log messages for NTP DS.

770
00:56:55,152 --> 00:57:12,918
Rym: I change the clock statements and then I'm using MRTG to graph the jumps in time to try to figure out when these big jumps are because the NTV loop stats were worthless because NTV is basically acting as though it's just on a server that has an unreliable hardware clock Which the real solution to that is.

771
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:19,067
Rym: well get a different server because their hardware clock is broken Yeah, but the VMware hardware clock is broken.

772
00:57:19,288 --> 00:57:25,478
Rym: Yes So I'm having this problem where now I have accurate time But I do not have precise time.

773
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:26,160
Rym: because that?

774
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,926
Rym: because while the time will be accurate.

775
00:57:28,046 --> 00:57:36,130
Rym: anytime you look at it I can't guarantee that while the clock ticks are going along that the clock remains accurate all the time.

776
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:39,401
Scott: Yeah, it's not ticking at one second per second.

777
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:41,990
Scott: But anytime you look at the time it'll it'll look right.

778
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:47,411
Rym: so I'm running the NTP loop stats and Those didn't tell me shit Those are.

779
00:57:47,892 --> 00:57:57,770
Rym: those were not very helpful, especially because with the tinker panic off NTP never realizes when it's having a problem Because it doesn't realize having a problem.

780
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:58,513
Scott: I can't tell you.

781
00:57:58,693 --> 00:58:04,313
Rym: what it'll do is it'll assume that the problem is the hardware clock and it'll just kind of put the time Back to where it was.

782
00:58:04,654 --> 00:58:06,882
Rym: So now I'm just I'm looking for any time.

783
00:58:06,922 --> 00:58:09,210
Rym: the clock moved by more than a second within a second.

784
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:19,550
Rym: But even then I've got all this data now and I'm trying to figure out a way to mine through the data to get something Useful, so I started running it on a Linux box.

785
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:24,348
Rym: I've got a physical Linux box to try to see if I get because you know, I get this data.

786
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:24,930
Rym: It's like alright.

787
00:58:25,493 --> 00:58:26,600
Rym: What does this data mean?

788
00:58:26,902 --> 00:58:34,022
Rym: I'm trying to compare it to the data I'm getting from a physical hardware box But I can't find any trends that are useful.

789
00:58:34,463 --> 00:58:42,527
Rym: and I'm getting to the point where I might just have to say Yeah, the time is accurate and kind of base my professional reputation on it because I can't prove the time is accurate.

790
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:49,050
Rym: I think There there are two good ideas that I've you know, what one idea is we're thinking about using Zen for all the servers.

791
00:58:49,091 --> 00:58:49,810
Rym: We're time matters.

792
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:57,710
Scott: Well, here's the thing I'd like to see what you get if you use Zen or User user mode Linux just sort of worse than Zen across the board.

793
00:58:58,091 --> 00:58:59,235
Rym: But well, it seems like Zen.

794
00:58:59,656 --> 00:59:04,689
Rym: from what I gather Zen is doing the same thing as user mode Linux in terms of hardware clock Yeah.

795
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:13,859
Scott: And I'm also wondering how it'll perform on say like bots or any of those like x86 like, you know machine emulator type.

796
00:59:13,899 --> 00:59:22,558
Rym: well, I Found another way to make this work to guarantee that I will have accurate time Mmm, but it I had like.

797
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,870
Rym: I was at a meeting where this was explained to me by a VMware engineer.

798
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:39,270
Rym: It made sense, but it's really kind of complicated to deal with and then I remember having to explain What I had just heard back to the VMware engineer to make sure that it because it was kind of ambiguous.

799
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:45,530
Rym: But basically let's say I have four core or let's have eight cores in my VMware cluster.

800
00:59:46,896 --> 01:00:05,189
Rym: if I want Accurate time and I want to guarantee that the virtual machine that I want to have accurate time on never gets descheduled I have to set a reservation a CPU reservation that is exactly equal to the frequency of the fastest core in the cluster.

801
01:00:07,212 --> 01:00:12,790
Rym: And that made sense but not like it makes sense on a top like a superficial perspective.

802
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,368
Rym: but I was thinking but why specifically is that what I must do?

803
01:00:16,388 --> 01:00:23,969
Rym: and Then I learned a whole bunch about how VMware allocates cycles between cores and how all that business.

804
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:36,728
Scott: well Yeah, because if using the ESX server, right the underlying operating system Linux or Windows or whatever Allocating cycles to the ESX server and then the ESX server allocates cycles to all the machines within it.

805
01:00:37,169 --> 01:00:43,038
Rym: Well It's basically the way it handles Reservations and the way it handles cores.

806
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,950
Rym: if I set it in this specific way and there's a little bit more to it.

807
01:00:47,030 --> 01:01:01,410
Rym: But and if I do all these things then I will never get Descheduled because it will never try to allocate those cycles to anyone else because the reservation Forces it to be on one of those big cores and forces it to always have that much core available.

808
01:01:02,073 --> 01:01:07,332
Rym: but so it's basically all the solutions I've gotten are these kind of Half-assed.

809
01:01:07,613 --> 01:01:20,030
Rym: Yeah, they pretty much work, but I can't verify that they work other than by trusting what the VMware engineers say or Looking at my loop stats that are of dubious quality.

810
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:35,930
Scott: See, I think that one solution and I know why VMware doesn't do this because they could do it easily and they'd actually Make a lot of money doing this is Right now VMware even the most expensive VMware runs on top of Linux or Windows or Mac or some sort of underlying operating system.

811
01:01:36,431 --> 01:01:42,330
Scott: They should just make the ESX server an operating system that runs directly on the hardware.

812
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:48,809
Rym: It actually is that like we run the ESX server, but it's actually a very specialized Linux and it is it is.

813
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:54,270
Scott: But I'm talking like if they remove that one layer This is the VMware kernel ran on your hardware.

814
01:01:54,651 --> 01:02:05,202
Scott: Then they could develop a protocol where that would know the time and have a special way of time To tell them how much time since it last gave them a cycle.

815
01:02:05,302 --> 01:02:11,945
Rym: because I've been a thorn in the VMware people's side for so Long they sent me the experimental solution.

816
01:02:12,447 --> 01:02:35,990
Rym: Oh, it's this Descheduling process that's part of this new VMware tools And if you run it supposedly whenever your VM gets descheduled when it comes back online, like when it gets his cycles back This process will basically allocate all the missed cycle Like all the time and cycles that were missed to this process as though that process had just used the whole processor for all that time.

817
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:41,749
Scott: and in Theory won't that make the clock just like jump up a whole bunch real quick?

818
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:50,414
Rym: No, because basically the in terms of the clock slewing in the way the clock is handled because when the VMware is Descheduled it can't do anything.

819
01:02:50,495 --> 01:02:52,219
Rym: Anyway, so it would be the same.

820
01:02:52,460 --> 01:03:01,724
Rym: it would in theory behave the same way as if When I had our physical server and a process temporarily used up 100% of the CPU.

821
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:01,884
Rym: Mm-hmm.

822
01:03:04,874 --> 01:03:16,343
Rym: The problem is I just can't get it to work Experimental and I can't get any support from VMware cuz even all this Has a watermark that says experimental no support.

823
01:03:16,604 --> 01:03:19,681
Rym: So I called VMware and I was like, hey I can't get this to work and they're like what.

824
01:03:20,245 --> 01:03:20,890
Scott: no support.

825
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:25,545
Scott: Yeah, did you not read what it said, but support the guy that gave it to me.

826
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,210
Rym: He didn't even give me any documentation.

827
01:03:27,412 --> 01:03:35,639
Rym: I'm trying to run this thing on my own and I got to do this kernel update but the kernel update just crash and didn't work and He's probably just sent you like a virus.

828
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,327
Scott: yeah said this is yeah, this is an update.

829
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:37,769
Scott: I'll do it.

830
01:03:38,411 --> 01:03:45,140
Rym: That's the issue I'm dealing with right now because all the other issues I'm dealing with are more business process Enterprise stuff than technical stuff.

831
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,567
Scott: Yeah, I could talk about.

832
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,398
Scott: you know People probably wanted me to talk about something complicated.

833
01:03:49,418 --> 01:03:50,381
Scott: that was programming.

834
01:03:50,441 --> 01:03:56,425
Scott: but to be honest with you the programming I do at work is is not is not interesting or complicated.

835
01:03:56,525 --> 01:03:57,690
Scott: So it's kind of lame.

836
01:03:57,851 --> 01:04:04,930
Rym: yeah, like if you wanted a more like Practical or IT thing like I guess something I really could have talked about is I had to guide this application.

837
01:04:05,452 --> 01:04:09,510
Rym: I don't want to get into it, but I had to run this thing on a server as a service.

838
01:04:09,871 --> 01:04:13,184
Rym: But it's an X only application that needs that going to be open.

839
01:04:13,344 --> 01:04:14,047
Scott: I hate that shit.

840
01:04:14,388 --> 01:04:33,450
Rym: Ah The bullshit I had to go through to make this thing work and I eventually came up with the way to run it in this fully headless mode, but it's not interactive and I Servicified it like I made a Python wrapper to where like, you know You start it like a service and it'll check just like it'll check a PID file to make sure it isn't already running.

841
01:04:33,531 --> 01:04:43,956
Rym: but that was extra complicated because someone could run it independently of this headless mode as a GUI with a separate PID and If you run it as a GUI, it's not.

842
01:04:44,117 --> 01:04:46,284
Rym: actually it doesn't run the process itself.

843
01:04:46,484 --> 01:04:51,359
Rym: It spawned some Java process so I gotta figure out what PID is like.

844
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,428
Rym: all the possible page that could be it and they all have different names.

845
01:04:54,689 --> 01:04:57,846
Rym: kill them All gracefully and then run it and then generate it.

846
01:04:57,886 --> 01:05:00,930
Rym: is all this bullshit I had to go through and I finally got it working.

847
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:06,849
Rym: I made a cron job to start it and stop it and everything was good and Then it still just stopped working one day.

848
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:08,532
Scott: That's bullshit.

849
01:05:09,014 --> 01:05:10,479
Rym: This program is like the worst thing ever.

850
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,746
Rym: Yeah, and there's no competitor.

851
01:05:12,766 --> 01:05:20,910
Rym: Ah Hate that I feel like with all the time I spent doing that I probably could have written something that did what it does in Python.

852
01:05:22,992 --> 01:05:24,624
Scott: Yeah, it depends what I have what it I mean.

853
01:05:24,644 --> 01:05:28,021
Scott: if there's no competitor There's a good thing to make because then you'd be the competitor.

854
01:05:28,162 --> 01:05:29,990
Scott: just step to do one step up and you win.

855
01:05:30,252 --> 01:05:31,222
Rym: I don't want to though.

856
01:05:31,243 --> 01:05:35,770
Rym: I The more I learn about the fixed protocol the less I want to deal with it.

857
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:38,696
Rym: But this program.

858
01:05:38,716 --> 01:05:40,825
Rym: but yeah that I mean I could talk about that in detail.

859
01:05:40,866 --> 01:05:46,410
Rym: That's a much more Practical thing like what do you do when you have a program that isn't a demon or isn't a service?

860
01:05:46,511 --> 01:05:49,830
Rym: But you want to treat it like it's a demon or like it's a service?

861
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:54,330
Scott: I give it its own computer So nothing else fucks with it and I just I make a custom machine.

862
01:05:54,711 --> 01:05:57,925
Scott: So it works and then I try to find a way to get rid of it.

863
01:05:58,166 --> 01:05:58,990
Rym: All right, let's do that.

864
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:03,107
Rym: We'll run into VMware, but then we had the time issue which totally screwed up.

865
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:03,810
Scott: No, no, no, I'd run it on it.

866
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,839
Scott: So I'll get a box and put it on the box.

867
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:13,730
Scott: Yeah, we think if I had an old DOS program I needed to run I would just go out get a DOS box put it on there and that box would do that one thing.

868
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:19,770
Scott: That way I can make the software on that computer custom-configured for that one thing.

869
01:06:19,951 --> 01:06:22,487
Scott: It would work perfectly and nothing else would fuck with it.

870
01:06:23,293 --> 01:06:25,669
Scott: That's pretty much the only thing you can do in a situation like that.

871
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:25,924
Scott: well

872
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:39,870
Rym: the worst thing was when we first started running this like I would basically X-forward the stupid GUI because I had to keep the GUI open because once you started running if you need to change anything if The GUI isn't running you have to just kill it and then start the GUI.

873
01:06:40,311 --> 01:06:49,790
Rym: Yep, so I'm for exporting the GUI and then alright, but now now that is running I Can't like save the configuration then run it headless.

874
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:50,770
Rym: I have to leave it running.

875
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:56,568
Rym: So if I log out of the X session or I turn off my computer it crashes.

876
01:06:56,648 --> 01:06:57,110
Rym: It's done.

877
01:06:57,451 --> 01:07:00,264
Scott: Well, yeah, cuz you're doing exporting you shouldn't do X forwarding for that.

878
01:07:00,324 --> 01:07:01,409
Rym: Yes, but what am I gonna do?

879
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:03,239
Rym: I don't have physical access to the machine.

880
01:07:03,259 --> 01:07:05,130
Scott: You could use a remote desktop situation.

881
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:09,684
Rym: No, cuz the one we're not gonna run VNC on these servers.

882
01:07:09,905 --> 01:07:11,470
Rym: no for various reasons.

883
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:16,990
Rym: So basically what I did is we have this rack card, which is like this, but you can use in an XDM CP.

884
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:25,924
Rym: Well, actually what we did is we had an IP console like a rack card where I can get Console access to the physical box via like a sideband are using the serial cable.

885
01:07:26,526 --> 01:07:27,329
Rym: No, no, no, no.

886
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:33,084
Rym: that That sideband interaction has come a long way since the last time you used it.

887
01:07:33,165 --> 01:07:34,249
Scott: serial cables the way to go.

888
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,578
Scott: man You want the security little no modem action?

889
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,750
Scott: No, why not now nowadays?

890
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:48,650
Rym: What you do is you have a separate subnet or a separate vlan actually and you connect all these rack cards to it or They're called different things but side the sideband is the way to go.

891
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:56,878
Rym: it's a card in the box that gives you console physical access or and even actually we have them where they give you a Web access to the console itself.

892
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:10,474
Rym: The security is pretty good actually like it's hard to break into it, but So I write basically I logged in there Ran X then I ran the program there and if anyone else needed to mess with it It was running there.

893
01:08:10,815 --> 01:08:23,207
Rym: and that was the safest way to do it except for the fact that the console because of Another unrelated issue the mouse cursor was always one inch to the left and one inch up Where it really was.

894
01:08:24,231 --> 01:08:31,889
Rym: And we have an open issue with the IP console people and they were like, well, yeah, we're not gonna fix that ever Assholes not fixing shit like that.

895
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:35,607
Rym: Yeah, those are the issues I deal with.

896
