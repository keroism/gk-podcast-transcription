00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,230
Rym: It's Wednesday May 28th I'm Rym.

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,778
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:15,600
Rym: We change it up a bit.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,899
Rym: We talk about whiteout the comic and animals that suck the anime.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,927
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:32,014
Scott: So you know that watchman movie.

7
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:34,736
Scott: They're making uh-huh yeah, yeah, I'm not.

8
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:46,186
Scott: I haven't been like I don't know interested to see any movie especially not in the theater in forever but this movie They have done some things.

9
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:56,946
Scott: two things that have actually raised my interest of seeing in the theater from negative a billion to negative 999 million all right.

10
00:00:57,407 --> 00:01:04,569
Scott: two things that that have given me confidence that this movie well actually three things But that have given me confidence.

11
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:14,659
Scott: three three things that have given me confidence The Pope right That this movie might not be to suck and will.

12
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:25,813
Scott: Number one Every picture from the movie that I see every photograph online Pretty much looks like the comic brought to life.

13
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,407
Scott: I mean the latest picture I saw was a pit.

14
00:01:28,427 --> 00:01:29,211
Scott: you know how.

15
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:31,240
Scott: I don't want to try to spoil anything.

16
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:32,243
Scott: You know the.

17
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,431
Scott: in between like chapters one and two there's like that sort of.

18
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:45,592
Scott: I guess it's an illustration of a photograph of Like the original old superhero team with like the guy in the hood, and I know all the old old guys The whatever they were.

19
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:55,239
Scott: yes There was a photograph released of like you know pretty much people in costumes You know you have making and it was looked exactly like the thing from the comic.

20
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,212
Scott: only It was you know a picture of real people huh in costumes.

21
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:58,996
Scott: I'll show it to you.

22
00:01:59,036 --> 00:01:59,458
Scott: It's pretty cool.

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,592
Scott: - right I have received a. well.

24
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:12,540
Scott: I have found I didn't receive it a Reliable word that this movie will be almost three hours long.

25
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,245
Rym: Whoo that you know.

26
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,048
Rym: it's weird you think.

27
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:17,995
Rym: ah that just means if it's bad.

28
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:19,200
Rym: It'll never end.

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,947
Rym: That's true, but

30
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:20,553
Scott: I know what it

31
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:35,398
Rym: means to me Is that they're letting the people making it do what they think is right because it's very rare For the producers whoever is involved in the making of a movie to let someone say yeah I'm gonna make this movie longer than you know the short average movies everyone sees.

32
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,044
Rym: hmm That's a big risk.

33
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:48,310
Scott: Yeah, it because that tells me you know in order to make this movie done Right you can't be leaving too much shit out, so if they're making it almost three hours We're reaching like the limit of what Hollywood's willing to deal with.

34
00:02:48,791 --> 00:03:02,969
Scott: that tells me that they're leaving all the important shit in now If you know if you've read Watchmen you know that there's some particular things that might be left out of the movie perhaps a Story about a black freighter, so

35
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,280
Rym: I imagine you've discovered that they have incorporated it a hundred percent.

36
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,388
Scott: No, not at all all right.

37
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,999
Scott: It's in fact perhaps better than that.

38
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,853
Scott: There's also You know the the pros parts in between the actual chapters of comic.

39
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:19,257
Scott: right all right?

40
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:20,299
Rym: How could it be better than that?

41
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:29,631
Scott: Hi, all right, so There's three hours of movie and there are two obvious Parts of the graphic novel that would be cut out of any movie.

42
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,654
Rym: are there intermissions?

43
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:32,500
Scott: no that would be awesome.

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,444
Scott: No, that would be wicked.

45
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:44,153
Scott: They're just an intermission for every single chapter like a little tiny one anyway I know what they're gonna Do is they have filmed right the black freighter and they have.

46
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,100
Scott: they have somehow filmed the the pros parts?

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:59,091
Scott: right those parts are going to be released on a DVD that you'll watch and Then go to the movie or go to the movie and then watch the DVD.

48
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:06,694
Scott: really yeah, so there's three hours of movie But that stuff is also there, but that's not part of those three hours man.

49
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:17,959
Rym: We you know luckily living in New York I'm sure there's gonna be a theater where we can see the black freighter, and then the Watchmen Maybe maybe maybe but if not granted honestly easily get the DVD.

50
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:22,780
Rym: I almost feel like if I were you'd probably better off seeing the freighter after the Watchmen.

51
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:24,569
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't really I mean for us.

52
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:25,112
Scott: It doesn't matter.

53
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:26,519
Scott: What order cuz you've read the book?

54
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,612
Rym: Yeah, but I'm thinking in general after seems better than before.

55
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:35,311
Scott: yeah the thing that still you know I'm gonna keep pushing people to read the Watchmen before this movie comes out.

56
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:38,140
Scott: read it before the movie cut read it again.

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,766
Rym: Yes, even though it's not in the book club.

58
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:40,208
Rym: Yes.

59
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,220
Scott: It will be read it and then you know.

60
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:51,300
Scott: I'm still worried though that if I own the comic book store or even a bookstore I would team up with the local movie theater to fucking sell the book.

61
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,360
Scott: I don't think there's gonna be enough book selling going on.

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,455
Scott: I mean when V for Vendetta came out they were selling the book.

63
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:58,500
Scott: you know more than usual.

64
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,500
Scott: You know what I would but not nearly enough.

65
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:01,645
Rym: You know what I would do.

66
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:13,343
Rym: I would set up a promotion where if I were a movie theater I'd make a deal with a local bookseller even just do it myself with Amazon where I would sell the book at a slight Discount.

67
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:19,151
Rym: if you brought a theos ticket like a stub to my place And I'd even sell the books in the theaters.

68
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:21,220
Scott: people need they do need to sell the book in the theater.

69
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,943
Scott: That's definite.

70
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:30,485
Scott: I think they should do is if you buy the book Right you get like a pass that will like you know one of the big Maybe not.

71
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:35,089
Scott: you know the local movie theater on the local level But like on the big level maybe like I don't know.

72
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:36,213
Scott: pick a movie theater chain.

73
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:38,020
Scott: crown crown is a movie theater chain.

74
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:39,697
Rym: Right I don't even know anymore.

75
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:40,482
Rym: AMC I guess.

76
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:41,427
Scott: so AMC.

77
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:42,934
Scott: AMC is definitely a theater chain.

78
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:44,120
Scott: Lowe's Lowe's is a good one too.

79
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:53,720
Scott: One of those big movie theater chain companies makes a deal with DC Comics and cuz you know they're gonna read Reprinting this as we speak right to put more on the shelves, right?

80
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:58,240
Scott: It's never been out of print because as soon as it goes out of print Alan Moore gets the rights back.

81
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,633
Scott: So and then DC's in deep shit, so it's definitely still in print.

82
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:06,167
Scott: so what they should start doing is the next batch You know the next run.

83
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:12,019
Scott: they should slip a coupon in there Maybe for free tickets or half off tickets at a specific theater chain.

84
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,495
Scott: You know do a little D. You know big-time partnership action going on.

85
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:16,258
Scott: I don't know.

86
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:23,222
Scott: They definitely need to do something to get people to buy the book buy the book read it Amazon Jeep Right.

87
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:25,700
Rym: so I don't really have a news cuz we're gonna get right into this.

88
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:35,359
Rym: We're doing a dual review tonight partly because we want to get through this stuff and partly cuz a lot more you are anime fans Than comic fans, so we're very pointedly putting the comic review first.

89
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:36,826
Rym: Uh-huh plus.

90
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:39,900
Rym: uh I think a lot of people who are into anime will probably like this comic.

91
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,740
Rym: Maybe well at least if you're into good manga.

92
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:57,520
Rym: But before we continue I just want to point out to everyone I know I mentioned it last week, but Friday this week as in Well, this is a Wednesday episode so Two days from now, but you're probably listening to this Thursday.

93
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:09,454
Rym: So that means tomorrow May 30th at 6 p.m.. In 2008 in the Kinokuniya bookstore near Bryant Park in New York City We will be there with Tokyo FM and Brian Nishi to interview Hal Cali.

94
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,219
Rym: They are they perform today, Sen They're pretty awesome.

95
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:17,708
Rym: You might notice that you might know them from my thing of the day if you're a time traveler.

96
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:25,889
Scott: Yeah, and If you want to learn about them you can learn about them the same way I learned about them and watch all their music videos on the YouTube.

97
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:32,274
Rym: or just come to the Kinokuniya this Friday May 30th Despite the fact that anime news network knows nothing about it.

98
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:33,640
Scott: They will soon.

99
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:45,220
Rym: Seriously though it'll if you're a fan of these two You'll be able to get pretty close to him because the Kinokuni is not that big and TMR pretty much filled the upstairs.

100
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:49,795
Scott: You'll also get to see us if you want to see us, and you haven't seen us.

101
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:53,037
Scott: so yeah I guess some people might want to see us.

102
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,972
Scott: Okay, so we went to the New York Comic Con and at the Oni table.

103
00:07:57,232 --> 00:07:59,479
Scott: There are some pretty awesome books going down.

104
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,048
Scott: Rym bought a little.

105
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:04,084
Scott: uh you buy the Scott Pilgrim poster there I might have.

106
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:10,364
Scott: yeah, but the thing is I was gonna buy some of those awesome books But I had ordered them pre-ordered them online.

107
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,446
Scott: so about a week later.

108
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:11,947
Scott: They showed up.

109
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:22,100
Scott: one of those awesome books is Whiteout by Gregor written by Greg Rucka art by Steve Lieber alright, and it's actually two volumes of it.

110
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,720
Scott: But Rym only read the first volume, so I'm also gonna talk about the first volume now Greg Rucka.

111
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:29,446
Scott: This guy is lately.

112
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:33,960
Scott: He's like my favorite new writing of comics guy favorite new comic star.

113
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:46,151
Scott: He's not new, but he's like my new favorite comics writer as and I discovered him somewhat recently He wrote that Gotham Central, which is all about the police in Gotham City and not so much Batman But mostly the police who there.

114
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:57,835
Scott: he wrote Queen and country which is a many multi-volume series of awesome British secret agent international CIA kind of action.

115
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,037
Scott: and He wrote whiteout which is what we're gonna talk about here now before we go any further.

116
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:07,996
Rym: if you just want the Soundbite review it's a comic that I liked.

117
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:18,687
Rym: oh no I mean It's really always the best recommendation you can get about something Oftentimes is from someone who hates that thing.

118
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:28,120
Rym: of course that doesn't always work because if someone really hates superhero comics And then they read a superhero comic that they like odds are it's not like superhero comics.

119
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,518
Rym: So if you like normal superhero comics you probably won't like the things that they like mmm.

120
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:35,624
Scott: Anyway whiteout To sum it up.

121
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:39,800
Scott: It's basically a whodunit murder mystery kind of deal, right?

122
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,343
Scott: So there's not.

123
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,172
Scott: you know the the if you look at it.

124
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:46,048
Scott: You know from such a zoomed out perspective It's not really exciting.

125
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,599
Scott: what is exciting about it?

126
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:51,954
Scott: And I think the the best part of this book is the fact that it's in Antarctica.

127
00:09:52,195 --> 00:10:03,205
Scott: now the setting of Antarctica You know and I guess it's a cool setting that's not used too often especially not for murder mysteries Like many people are there You know.

128
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:23,098
Scott: but what gets me about this book and actually makes me really interested in, Antarctica And I kind of want to go there now is that since the setting of Antarctica It's such a dangerous barren place with no people the setting almost becomes a character in this book Basically a character that's out to fuck everyone all of the time.

129
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:23,861
Scott: You

130
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:46,079
Rym: know actually it's very interesting because I might have said it with somewhat more eloquence than that But much like if you read the terror that the book I think I talked about it a while ago It's about a bunch of Arctic explorers who eventually get trapped in the ice And I don't think it's a spoiler to say that they pretty much all died because it's based on a true story and in the true Story everyone pretty much all died.

131
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:58,153
Scott: Well, I mean, but there's a lot of similar stories that I've you know well stories that use the same mechanism like you read a submarine story and there's always that constant dread of the Dangers of what it's like on a submarine.

132
00:10:58,193 --> 00:11:00,744
Scott: or you read a like tank police.

133
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:03,312
Scott: you read tank police and it's like the constant dangers of.

134
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:08,789
Scott: you know the cloud of bacterial gas outside or So you know people are in space.

135
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,833
Scott: Apollo 13 is a perfect example where you know space and and the shuttle are a character in themselves.

136
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:18,866
Scott: you know providing all of the Conflict for the characters.

137
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:20,212
Scott: you know taking the role of.

138
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:21,960
Scott: you know the villain in what you will.

139
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:27,500
Scott: But this book actually has you know a villain and that is you know the murderer and whatnot.

140
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:31,880
Scott: But it also has the the sort of side villain of Antarctica itself.

141
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:35,959
Scott: It's not so much a villain because it fucks the bad guys just as much as fucks the good guys.

142
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:45,131
Scott: Anyway, so white out the story centers around this character the main character And she's sort of like this secret.

143
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:46,217
Scott: She's not a secret agent.

144
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:48,663
Scott: She's like It's hard to say.

145
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:56,169
Scott: she's like a marshal from the US and she's sort of like the police of Antarctica where No guns are allowed now.

146
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,800
Rym: There's an interesting story about why she's working in Antarctica.

147
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,629
Rym: That's I guess that deal throughout the course of the plot.

148
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:01,990
Scott: That's her.

149
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:09,439
Scott: You know her her personal backstory deal, but It's kind of it's it the fact that no guns are allowed.

150
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,246
Scott: yet She has to police Antarctica.

151
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:14,660
Scott: at least you know police Antarctica as far as US interests are concerned.

152
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:25,650
Scott: It's so funny because they you know they keep pointing out you know all the things that you know the treaties surrounding Antarctica say you have to do and then everyone breaks all the rules all the time.

153
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:32,179
Scott: well not everyone not everyone pretty much just Just bad guys and some good guys.

154
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,182
Rym: But it's interesting because you know there's a police officer And they don't say.

155
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:39,920
Rym: I mean if you don't know about Antarctica you wouldn't think like yeah, duh no guns.

156
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,567
Rym: But they don't really say it outright.

157
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:46,852
Rym: so right away at least you're reading you think cop whatever And then suddenly it's like but you think all right.

158
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:47,395
Rym: She's a cop.

159
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:48,260
Rym: Here's the situation.

160
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:49,508
Rym: She'll just pull a gun and everything.

161
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:50,273
Rym: Oh wait a minute.

162
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:53,668
Rym: Oh No guns right.

163
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,591
Scott: Yeah, that sort of still ties into the the Antarctica as a character.

164
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:16,877
Scott: because not just you know the the weather and Physicalness of the continent are dangerous to the characters, but you know the laws and treaties Surrounding you know this international land see also in Almost a cop-out to say the setting is a character when really it's just a setting.

165
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,455
Scott: it is But it's a very strong setting that plays heavily.

166
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:22,504
Rym: you know it is But I guess it would what.

167
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:27,077
Rym: it's a comic and it's mostly dialogue and poses and such and it's drawn black and white.

168
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:28,344
Rym: so I Don't know that.

169
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:35,158
Rym: while the setting is very strong I don't know if it has quite as much characterization or any of those things that I'd see and say the terror.

170
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:38,257
Scott: no No, maybe not, but it's still pretty there.

171
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:51,460
Scott: Another thing that I really really like I think I like more about this comic than anything else is Greg Raka obviously did a shit ton of research about Antarctica like holy crap.

172
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,950
Scott: Just did he learn like everything there is to know like about.

173
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,620
Scott: you know the weather where all the bases are you know how?

174
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,620
Scott: people transport around You know what countries have you know positions where?

175
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,700
Rym: At the same Token a lot of that you could get just from reading Wikipedia.

176
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:12,653
Scott: Yeah, but I mean he actually bothered to do the research.

177
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:17,318
Scott: you know when he puts all this information And especially interesting tidbits of the information in the book.

178
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:27,320
Rym: well That's one thing that's very good about it in that a lot of the Information is just part of the story And it just makes sense and it's presented in a kind of sensical sequitur way in the story.

179
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:30,130
Rym: It's not just like well blah blah blah.

180
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,655
Rym: Here's a map blah blah blah.

181
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:32,277
Rym: It's just well.

182
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,040
Rym: They're going to this base.

183
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,045
Rym: How are they going to this base?

184
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,859
Rym: and the distances and what's going on makes sense in that context yep?

185
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,740
Scott: But I mean he's telling you a fictional story about fictional characters.

186
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:48,919
Scott: but the information he gives you about the setting that they're in is Information that is true about the same setting in the real world.

187
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:55,080
Scott: So you can be entertained by a fictional story and learn about Antarctica at the same time.

188
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:59,560
Scott: And whenever you learn about something get interested in it, and now I'm interested about Antarctica.

189
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:02,350
Rym: I don't think you actually want to go to Antarctica.

190
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,639
Scott: I do on the one hand but on the other hand.

191
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:06,184
Scott: I don't Know.

192
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:15,849
Rym: I mean I think part of the reason I like this was that it was a self-contained story start to finish and while there's kind of background information all this it all kind Of plays in and comes full circle.

193
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,980
Rym: There's no loose ends nothing's left hanging.

194
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:22,815
Rym: It's just a solid police a little bit procedural kind of adventuring story.

195
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:23,979
Rym: That's really all there is to it.

196
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:26,429
Rym: Stylistically, I mean it's really simple.

197
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,720
Rym: It's well it appears very simple.

198
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,072
Rym: I mean just black and white and different textures and all that.

199
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:35,239
Rym: but when you read the back and he explains you know how he drew it and put it together.

200
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:45,097
Rym: a lot of work actually went into the composition in the drawing and he'd like put ink and different things and then scratch it away and Do different kinds of art and all the different scenes.

201
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:50,338
Scott: well I mean think about it right Antarctica is like the perfect setting for a black and white comic book.

202
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,674
Scott: because Instead of you know and say a color comic you know you might need to draw the snow or some such.

203
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,841
Scott: here the pages are White.

204
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:01,452
Scott: so drawing snow means not drawing.

205
00:16:01,632 --> 00:16:02,515
Rym: yes, cuz then those.

206
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:05,589
Rym: usually when I print colored comics I print them on black paper.

207
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,897
Scott: I know sometimes they do.

208
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:11,055
Scott: actually You know you'll read like a comic and like all the pages like black around the edge.

209
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:13,585
Rym: That's ink on paper I know.

210
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:16,235
Scott: I mean sometimes you know the pages aren't perfectly white either.

211
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:18,439
Scott: They're sort of yellowish anyway.

212
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,745
Rym: There's no black paper.

213
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:23,191
Rym: There's construction paper.

214
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:24,536
Scott: construction paper is cool.

215
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:25,620
Scott: I like construction paper.

216
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:29,731
Scott: But Anyway, yeah, I like the art a lot.

217
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:30,877
Scott: actually you know it might.

218
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:31,420
Scott: It's not.

219
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:33,646
Scott: It's not very cartoony.

220
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:39,527
Rym: It's very sort of you know realistic, and I think one thing I noticed I was reading it about halfway through.

221
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:41,394
Rym: I said wait a minute, so I went over.

222
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:48,365
Rym: I pulled out sanctuary and I flipped over into a few pages, and I flipped through this and the way a lot of.

223
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:57,800
Rym: I mean it definitely does not have the gecky gah face or The gecky gah pose or any of that, but or especially there's no gecky gah hero.

224
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:18,487
Rym: No but one thing that it does have is if you look at the way characters stand and The way like all the different frames are kind of put together There they look very similar in terms of it's very Cinematic and very kind of dramatic eyes the way characters stand and the way they move Mm-hmm to where I guess the only.

225
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:25,633
Rym: if you just took the faces of characters from sanctuary and put them on these characters It would work pretty well a day.

226
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:28,525
Scott: I definitely think that We're pretty well.

227
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:28,866
Scott: Also.

228
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,371
Scott: I noticed a lot of the paneling.

229
00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:32,980
Scott: You know it's he definitely mixes it up.

230
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,529
Scott: It's like somewhere between it.

231
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:42,624
Scott: You know it's not quite the Typical like you know Marvel Comics kind of boring paneling you know But it's all.

232
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:45,680
Scott: it's not quite the out-of-control manga paddling.

233
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,020
Scott: It's like this nice in-between where some pages will just have like you know like an a box of nine.

234
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,160
Scott: You know rectangles.

235
00:17:52,661 --> 00:18:00,145
Scott: But other pages will do sort of more of a like a Will Eisner sort of open panel on the bottom with like three Overlaying it.

236
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,732
Scott: and you know he mixes it up.

237
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:02,576
Scott: It's it's pretty cool.

238
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:03,319
Scott: I like that action.

239
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:11,200
Rym: I think the best part about it was that the story escalates Really quickly and it it's kind of it goes faster than you'd expect.

240
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,592
Rym: I mean it starts, and you know you read a typical story, and it's all right here.

241
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:15,174
Rym: We go.

242
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:19,740
Rym: There's gonna be this up now There's gonna be the build-up to that and then there's gonna be the action later.

243
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:27,230
Rym: But it steps it up right away, and then it steps it up again right away And you get right into the thick of it, and then it's done.

244
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,300
Scott: Yeah, I mean I sort of figured out.

245
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:32,349
Scott: It's one of those ones where you can figure out.

246
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:42,480
Rym: you know the who done it sort of like three corners obvious right away What's going on at least everything, but the the the twist how are they gonna get away with it at the end?

247
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:52,197
Scott: Yeah, I mean it's sort of like I figured most of it out about three-quarters of the way through But then like a couple pages before you know the real ending.

248
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:53,060
Scott: I figured that out.

249
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,798
Scott: So it was like ah there's a. there was a second thing that sort of you know catches you.

250
00:18:57,281 --> 00:19:00,560
Rym: There's really only one problem with this comic what?

251
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,939
Rym: it's a very central plot element and It's not as bad as the newest.

252
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,465
Rym: well not the newest, but the second newest Batman movie where Microwaves kill everybody in the city or wait.

253
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,449
Rym: No they just make steam.

254
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:24,035
Rym: but in this comic the McGuffin as it were is Ludicrously just dumb like it's the dumbest thing.

255
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,457
Scott: yeah, it's.

256
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:32,011
Scott: I'm glad though that it doesn't play Like the McGuffin itself like even though it's there the McGuffin You know.

257
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:35,450
Scott: it doesn't play that much of a role like you know It's.

258
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:40,450
Scott: it's only discussed very a little bit and then a little bit at the end and mostly they could have made a better McGuffin.

259
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,780
Scott: I they definitely could have made a better McGuffin, but it was.

260
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:51,369
Scott: it was mostly about you know the characters And you know who was you know killed all these people in such as opposed to you know?

261
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,080
Scott: Why the why was sort of just there?

262
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,690
Scott: because they needed a reason for the killings to happen?

263
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:02,010
Rym: But let's talk about the characters a little bit because there's really three kind of main primary characters.

264
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,250
Rym: There's the domain character the cop and I like her because she's very non-stereotypical.

265
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:10,116
Scott: Yeah, her name's Carrie right.

266
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:14,730
Rym: She's a US marshal okay, and then there's the other girl who she works with.

267
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,148
Scott: She's like the secret agent from the UK.

268
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:20,890
Rym: What you I believe you mean Albion right right?

269
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,580
Rym: And then there's the doctor who is one of those like.

270
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:26,814
Rym: he's the salty sea dog of the South Arctic And he's just.

271
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:31,515
Rym: he's like the best friend in the Arctic of the main character And he's just like this cool doctor guy.

272
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:34,626
Rym: and the three of them are pretty much the characters.

273
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:37,962
Rym: everyone else is either Villain or side character.

274
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,310
Scott: yep pretty much, okay?

275
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:48,708
Scott: So there is a second volume of whiteout and sort of what it is is Greg Rucka and Steve Lieber said hey We actually have an opportunity to work together again.

276
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:50,576
Scott: Whiteout was awesome.

277
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:51,821
Scott: Can we do it again?

278
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:52,845
Scott: Oh my god.

279
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:59,474
Scott: We can do it again and Basically what they do is they don't tell you know a Murder mystery story.

280
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:06,712
Scott: they tell a different kind of story much in the same fashion, but also in Antarctica.

281
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:07,796
Rym: I know that you're not saying.

282
00:21:07,836 --> 00:21:09,763
Rym: what kind of story is that kind of a spoiler?

283
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:15,008
Rym: is it something where you really have to Read it to see Cuz I forget.

284
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,941
Scott: But yeah, and I'm not that good at remembering.

285
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:22,570
Scott: You know things like that especially in two seconds.

286
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,936
Rym: But didn't you just read it?

287
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,643
Rym: How do you read a comic?

288
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:27,390
Rym: and then I remember that's like saying yeah?

289
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,276
Rym: I read this comic called Superman.

290
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:30,119
Rym: What's it about?

291
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,870
Scott: fuck if I know I read it like a couple weeks ago My brain started not doing so well.

292
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,337
Scott: but anyway, it's It's basically it's just if you like to whiteout.

293
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:49,460
Scott: you'll probably like whiteout - but it for some like when I read it It just felt like slightly less Enjoyable than whiteout one, but I don't really.

294
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,143
Scott: you know.

295
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:52,571
Scott: I could really put my finger on exactly Why.

296
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:55,622
Scott: maybe it's because I already you know knew the characters and sort of.

297
00:21:55,903 --> 00:21:57,930
Scott: you know I was comfortable in the setting more so.

298
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:02,710
Scott: So it was less exciting and new and fresh and maybe it seems like I mean the first comic.

299
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:15,165
Rym: whiteout was really good and I think part of the reason it was good is that it Ended and it was a solid story from start to finish and there was a lot there And especially with kind of the last few panels and the little like little subtle things.

300
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:20,930
Rym: I really like the last two pages But it's it's felt like it's one of those things where it's a setup.

301
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:35,189
Rym: It could keep going But I feel like it really would be better off if it just didn't keep going if it just was this one story because otherwise they'd either run out of stuff or They'd have to go in a completely different direction with it right away, or get old mm-hmm.

302
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,270
Scott: Yeah, basically what they do is they just tell another self-contained story in an arc.

303
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,370
Scott: And now you could actually probably read the second volume before you read the first one.

304
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:48,524
Scott: But it sort of makes some assumptions that you know about the characters a little bit.

305
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:50,390
Rym: it assumes that you know it's cold.

306
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:52,644
Scott: Yeah, well they all assume.

307
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:53,470
Scott: You know it's cold.

308
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,330
Scott: So yeah whiteout is definitely a high-quality comic.

309
00:22:57,731 --> 00:23:03,029
Scott: I'm definitely putting Greg Rucka on my automatic buying list for anything that has his name on it.

310
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:04,775
Scott: It's from Oni.

311
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,966
Scott: those are the people who published the Scott Pilgrim and this bill.

312
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:12,713
Scott: this volume is $14, but I can't imagine it's gonna be $14 in Amazon.

313
00:23:12,753 --> 00:23:13,894
Scott: It's got to be less than that right.

314
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:21,720
Rym: so things of the day.

315
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:25,896
Rym: What I have here is you know it's it's one thing to say all right.

316
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:26,940
Rym: here's something crazy.

317
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,020
Rym: Here's something just wacky and out there because it's the days of the internet and YouTube or if you want to see something weird.

318
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:41,018
Rym: There is enough weird stuff out there to keep you say - but every now and then Something kind of goes beyond just a little bit now.

319
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:51,259
Rym: We're here We're talking to Hal Cali on Friday, but of all their music videos You should probably see this one because you think oh, it's just gonna be weird and zany.

320
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,007
Rym: right It's really weird.

321
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,534
Scott: is this a twinkle star one.

322
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:57,007
Rym: Yes twinkle star Yeah.

323
00:23:57,322 --> 00:24:06,406
Scott: I watched a bunch of their music videos But this song of all their songs that I want that to listen to is like stuck in my head like doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

324
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:08,440
Rym: I don't know I really like all gaku no sushi.

325
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,164
Scott: Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

326
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:10,090
Scott: I don't think I watch.

327
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,834
Scott: I listen to that one.

328
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:18,919
Scott: I like that one a lot Yeah, but the twinkle star song is totally in my head and the music video is totally wacky And Doesn't quite do it.

329
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:23,340
Rym: I think the moment I lost is when that cow comes in the cow just the slow.

330
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,899
Scott: So the fighting the Fox turning into a cat and the gorilla with the boombox.

331
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:37,120
Rym: I just the fact that despite all the craziness you get honey get used to it And then there's the cow slow pan and it's one thing to just put a cow in a music video.

332
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:40,939
Rym: It's another thing to put a slow pan of a cow in a music video.

333
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,549
Scott: Yeah, it is.

334
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:48,960
Scott: You should watch at least this and then Thank You Japan, maybe you'll decide if you like these people or not.

335
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:52,860
Rym: I'll probably link to the other music video too because I actually like that one in a non-ironic way.

336
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:56,653
Scott: Yeah, I like that like I actually do like the song with the.

337
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:57,276
Rym: I like the song.

338
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,460
Scott: the music videos is wacky.

339
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:01,351
Rym: Of course, all the music videos are a little wacky at least.

340
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:03,460
Scott: Yeah, I gotta ask them why their music videos?

341
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:04,745
Rym: I think that's the first question.

342
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:05,488
Rym: I'm gonna ask him.

343
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:06,251
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

344
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:10,480
Scott: All right, so I Had a hard time finding a thing of the day, but check this out.

345
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:22,154
Scott: I found this webcomic right and it seems like he's about to do like a whole bunch of strips that are related Right, and this is like the strip that's starting off this little storyline and the story is right.

346
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:45,540
Scott: all of the public domain Characters that Disney is used over time such as Snow White the hunchback little mermaid etc, etc, right are all hanging out in like public domain forest or whatever and They're going to the Mickey's castle to get Mickey to join them because he his copyright is up.

347
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:45,942
Scott: But it's.

348
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:48,653
Scott: but it's not because you know the law extended it.

349
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:50,822
Scott: It's pretty funny Uh-huh.

350
00:25:51,404 --> 00:26:01,540
Scott: I want to see where he goes with this and I think I think it's gonna be good stuff because he's got the nice Copyright commentary, but he's also got the nice, you know jokes about all these characters.

351
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:02,867
Scott: It's good stuff.

352
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:04,939
Scott: All right, nice simple thing of the day.

353
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:09,833
Rym: So it's rare that we find an anime that is new or not new.

354
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:12,340
Rym: ish at least that we both immediately like.

355
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,700
Scott: Well, it helps that you know, it's nice.

356
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:18,000
Scott: It's one of those shows where all the episodes are like five minutes long.

357
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:19,809
Scott: So our attention spans.

358
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,754
Scott: we can actually watch it.

359
00:26:20,794 --> 00:26:21,879
Scott: how almost all of it.

360
00:26:22,301 --> 00:26:25,994
Rym: So basically our anime tastes are getting to the point to where we're basically children.

361
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:27,540
Scott: Well, I mean, there's a whole genre.

362
00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:31,780
Scott: I don't know if the US doesn't really have an equivalent for this, but there's a whole genre of anime.

363
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:39,308
Scott: I don't even know if it's a genre but a whole set of anime shows where the episodes are really short like Risky safety.

364
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:40,640
Scott: All the episodes are really short.

365
00:26:42,422 --> 00:26:43,751
Scott: He pots and he moves to me.

366
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:45,000
Scott: all the episodes are like.

367
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:47,779
Rym: I think we've talked about that show.

368
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,162
Rym: Yeah,

369
00:26:48,463 --> 00:27:04,596
Scott: but you know, I don't know when these things air in Japan But I imagine they must have some like television spot that like these things can go in You know whereas in America if you want to see like a short cartoon thing like that You'll find it maybe is like part of a Sesame Street or something like that.

370
00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:09,400
Scott: or you know I get think like what itchy and scratchy would be if it was, you know real, you know.

371
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,710
Scott: Or if there was actually like a bows of the cloud.

372
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,324
Scott: and he showed you like one Tom and Jerry cartoon But I bring up bows of the clown.

373
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:22,499
Scott: He was a frightening human being it was but even like one Tom and Jerry cartoon is almost Longer than one of these, you know.

374
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:24,344
Rym: Case in point.

375
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:30,446
Rym: I remember a day back in the anime club at RIT where we chose to Marathon risky safety.

376
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:44,080
Rym: and the thing is there was always this debate and if you've ever been in an anime club You always have these debates, you know, sob or dub Robots or shoujo, you know all the different but one of them was always do you show the opener and closer to an anime?

377
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,604
Rym: Every episode.

378
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:52,144
Scott: Yeah, if you're gonna watch if you're gonna show the anime club right four episodes of Try gun, right?

379
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:54,212
Scott: You get the opener and close.

380
00:27:54,232 --> 00:27:55,015
Scott: They're pretty cool.

381
00:27:55,055 --> 00:28:00,979
Scott: They're good openers and closes I'm not gonna deny and you should definitely show the opener at least once in the closer at least once.

382
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:04,820
Scott: But should you skip them in between the episodes now?

383
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:07,100
Rym: It's you might think this is just a simple argument.

384
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,950
Scott: Or should you watch the order four times in the closer four times?

385
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:11,596
Rym: fan subbers would cater to this.

386
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:11,817
Rym: to where?

387
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:18,262
Rym: if you're watching fan Subs like any good fan sub the first time you watch the opener you get the translation Subtitles.

388
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:21,991
Rym: the second episode has the romaji subtitles.

389
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:29,793
Rym: the third episode will have oftentimes either no subtitles No, the clean opener or they'll have just the Japanese subtitles.

390
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:31,840
Rym: And then if they do that the fourth will have the clean opener.

391
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:38,006
Scott: Yeah, a lot of them will like alternate or you know between the two or three different You know kinds of subtitles.

392
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:41,040
Scott: some of them will put like one at the top one at the bottom and karaoke it.

393
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:49,480
Scott: But you know, it's this big debate and you know What we tended to do is for watching a four episodes of a new show We would you know show all the openers and closers

394
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:56,840
Rym: Actually works really well because they gave you a three minute kind of Intermission between each episode where people would talk or run out and get a drink or go to the bath

395
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:58,959
Scott: And also some shows, you know mixed it up.

396
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,051
Scott: It actually had slight differences during the openers and closers.

397
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:04,720
Scott: the opener and closer wouldn't be the same for every episode.

398
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,280
Rym: That's always except for the try gun release in the US where they must have missed that when they were bringing it over.

399
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,079
Rym: Yeah, they took the opener from the first episode and just used it on all the DVDs.

400
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:18,457
Scott: But the actual try gun opener does change every episode in the Japanese release, but not in the US.

401
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:22,708
Rym: Yeah lonely a little bit It's not a big deal Rocky one.

402
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:27,732
Rym: You got to watch every opening Except they change like two seconds of.

403
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,319
Scott: I know they're such assholes.

404
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:35,255
Scott: Anyway, when you're watching a show where the actual show itself is like less than five minutes long.

405
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:36,960
Scott: How do you justify?

406
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:45,242
Scott: Watching like three minutes of opener and closer for each episode that there's more opener and closer than there is episode Now?

407
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,920
Rym: that was the anime club policy to show the openers and closers.

408
00:29:48,940 --> 00:30:00,325
Rym: So we swear show in risky safety and after you know Five or so episodes people are getting a little antsy because there's almost more open or closer than there is show Especially with the previews.

409
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:05,080
Scott: Yeah, you're watching the preview for the next time on the five minutes of risky safety.

410
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,783
Scott: You're gonna watch.

411
00:30:05,963 --> 00:30:08,934
Rym: but the thing is we asked the club like should we skip it?

412
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,427
Rym: and some people yelled hell Yes, good God.

413
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:15,307
Rym: and other people were like no No, we want to see it.

414
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:19,080
Rym: and it turned into this thing where people started yelling stuff out during the opener.

415
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:22,495
Rym: Okay, it was like this mini cult meme for one night and then it died.

416
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:23,680
Rym: and that was the end of that.

417
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,071
Scott: Yeah, by the way the show we're talking about today.

418
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,783
Rym: I'm echo dobutsu Dameko.

419
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:30,488
Scott: dobutsu is a Trent.

420
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:31,631
Scott: Emily taught me what it means.

421
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:34,239
Scott: Dameko is like, you know, Dom a it's like.

422
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:37,556
Scott: It's basically means useless like no no good.

423
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:40,347
Scott: and then Dovitsu is animals.

424
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,398
Scott: So the show is the useless animals.

425
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:42,700
Scott: I like.

426
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:46,699
Scott: I like to call it the animals that suck because this show.

427
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:52,380
Rym: maybe I should read the Description that I've got in front of me here because it serves it best.

428
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,280
Rym: All right, each of these animals does not live up to the expectations and standards of his or her species.

429
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:01,339
Scott: Yeah, pretty much have a wolf that is not ferocious.

430
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:05,492
Scott: You have a unicorn that drinks sake and is womanizing.

431
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:08,240
Rym: you have a cheetah who can't run and trips over.

432
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,720
Scott: You got a near-sighted eagle.

433
00:31:12,242 --> 00:31:13,185
Rym: Who's an asshole?

434
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:15,636
Rym: I love the rabbit cuz he's like the rabbit.

435
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:16,640
Rym: don't you make fun of me?

436
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,639
Rym: I have all the traits common to my species solitary and untrusted.

437
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:25,170
Scott: Yeah, that rabbit really reminds me of that.

438
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,374
Scott: that Cromartie High School.

439
00:31:26,394 --> 00:31:38,203
Scott: That's another short show Cromartie That Cromartie High School thing where it's like mmm if a rabbit is in a lion's den and it's not dead That's some fucking rabbit You know.

440
00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:41,900
Scott: and that this rabbit is totally that because it kicks all the other animals asses.

441
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:45,269
Rym: But this is a show that was it's based on.

442
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:55,534
Rym: there was a comic series from manga life back in like 2001 written by Noriko kawara and it's Basically just five minutes of these animals failing at life.

443
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:57,400
Rym: now what makes it interesting?

444
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,247
Rym: I mean, this is a kid a kid show.

445
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:01,074
Rym: It's on kids station.

446
00:32:01,596 --> 00:32:02,299
Rym: It's a kids show.

447
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:05,227
Rym: But the animals they're not just animals.

448
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:08,976
Rym: it's not like a cute anime animal rabbit who fights with the wolf or whatever.

449
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:15,517
Rym: they're basically adults in Like animal suits living in the woods.

450
00:32:15,658 --> 00:32:23,420
Rym: Yeah There's 21 year old guy in a wolf suit and the rabbit is this 26 year old dude wearing a rabbit suit.

451
00:32:23,661 --> 00:32:27,030
Scott: Yeah, it's not it's it's sort of furry in that way.

452
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:30,620
Scott: But really if you watch the show you'll realize it's not a furry.

453
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,111
Scott: It's a cute comedy that just happens to have furry visuals.

454
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:34,834
Rym: I don't know.

455
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:36,600
Rym: you seem to like what's-her-name the panther girl.

456
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,185
Scott: Oh panther girls hot yo.

457
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:39,328
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

458
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:42,157
Rym: I like her a lot, but I also like the.

459
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:43,240
Rym: oh, you know what?

460
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,293
Rym: I think all the members of the female feline club win.

461
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:50,286
Scott: Well, yeah, they're all they're all good But the panther girls the best.

462
00:32:50,506 --> 00:33:05,436
Rym: but the show opens with the panther girl reminds me a lot of the the nuts the the serious teacher from Azumanga dive Ah But I don't know is a wolf who sucks and he's traveling with a bindle and he's hungry.

463
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:07,263
Rym: and he sees a rabbit and thinks Huh?

464
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:08,830
Rym: Pray good God.

465
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,020
Rym: and he goes to try to eat the rabbit and the rabbit kick his ass.

466
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,969
Rym: Rabbit's name was Sahara rabbits a jerk.

467
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:20,420
Rym: and then from there we meet the rest of these people And they just I don't think I can express to you how much they suck.

468
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:23,570
Scott: They pretty much suck at everything and it's basically every.

469
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:25,817
Scott: the wolf was looking for a new home.

470
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,720
Scott: You know, he's got a bindle.

471
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:27,467
Scott: he's on the road.

472
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:35,286
Scott: he doesn't have a place to live and he wasn't gonna live in this forest with the shitty rabbit that he hated and then that the Cheetah girl came along.

473
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,794
Scott: he go or leopard.

474
00:33:36,835 --> 00:33:37,257
Scott: Yeah cheetah.

475
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:39,953
Scott: She's a cheater Yeah, she's.

476
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:45,714
Scott: Then he falls in love with the clumsy cheetah at first sight.

477
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,180
Scott: so he decides to live in this forest.

478
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,780
Scott: But every animal in the forest is no good at what they're supposed to be good at.

479
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,727
Scott: You got a whale who can't swim.

480
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:54,011
Rym: the whale has floaties.

481
00:33:54,352 --> 00:33:56,580
Scott: the whale has a floaty and it can't swim.

482
00:33:57,284 --> 00:34:06,760
Rym: I think my bet the favorite name of all these people those Pegonoscale yeah The shy Pegasus shy emo super depressed Pegasus.

483
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:11,268
Rym: Good God He's so great.

484
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,239
Scott: I figured the unicorn would be your guy though.

485
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,000
Rym: See, I'd really like the unicorn too because he there's really nothing wrong with him except that he's just an asshole.

486
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,550
Rym: He lives in the woods, but like kind of by himself.

487
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,860
Scott: I think the unicorn is the character closest to Rym.

488
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:26,699
Rym: Well, he is a woman.

489
00:34:29,223 --> 00:34:29,705
Scott: Is the woman?

490
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:33,540
Scott: I think long-haired be shown in unicorns who drink sake all the time.

491
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:44,906
Rym: But is he's mad lazy I think I mean what works is that you uni Hiko the unicorn and usa Hara the rabbit are both jerks But they're jerks in different ways.

492
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:48,340
Rym: the rabbit beats people up and the unicorn just messes with people.

493
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,812
Rym: Yeah And the two of them usually well like.

494
00:34:51,831 --> 00:35:00,060
Rym: there's one good episode where the two of them are kind of Hanging out watching the wolf just suck and they're basically just getting drunk and talking about how much he sucks while he's sucking.

495
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:04,720
Scott: Yeah, my favorite part with the unicorn and the rabbit is the rabbit.

496
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:09,922
Scott: You know the unicorn goes up to the wolf and he's like, you know, he's like, okay the unicorn just met the wolf Right.

497
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:10,506
Scott: It was a horror.

498
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:12,498
Scott: and he says, you know, tell me I will.

499
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:13,964
Scott: he's like I will listen to your wish.

500
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:17,900
Scott: and the wolf is like, oh man the you the magically unicorns gonna grant me my wish.

501
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:22,720
Scott: So he's like, you know, I wish you know as he wishes for like Chico right or something like that.

502
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:24,310
Rym: I forget what he wishes for.

503
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,740
Rym: I don't want to be a coward.

504
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:27,873
Scott: Yeah, he wants courage because that's what he sucks at.

505
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:28,014
Scott: He's.

506
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:29,831
Scott: he's not a courageous wolf he's a cowardly wolf.

507
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:35,176
Scott: and The unicorn is like well try hard someday and you'll you'll get there.

508
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:39,819
Scott: and the wolf is like Oh, you really were just listening and not granting you ass.

509
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:45,556
Scott: So then he's done the unicorn as the rabbit what his wishes and the rabbits like her.

510
00:35:45,837 --> 00:35:46,880
Scott: and he's like I want your horn.

511
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:48,787
Scott: He's like what do you want my horn for?

512
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:49,530
Scott: and the rabbits like.

513
00:35:49,811 --> 00:35:51,256
Scott: my mom is sick in your horn.

514
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,786
Scott: if I grind it up I can make medicine for my mom.

515
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:55,434
Rym: now then the best part.

516
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,920
Rym: He pulls out this other horn.

517
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,322
Rym: He's like.

518
00:35:57,482 --> 00:35:59,932
Scott: he pulls out this horn and he tries to give it to the rabbit.

519
00:35:59,972 --> 00:36:02,020
Scott: He's like, oh here I have something for you.

520
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,484
Scott: He's like really.

521
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:04,066
Scott: he's like.

522
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:08,740
Rym: this is the horn of my former lover who died blah blah blah tragedy.

523
00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:13,537
Rym: You can have it, but it's still a little cursed if you're okay with that.

524
00:36:14,863 --> 00:36:20,591
Scott: And the rabbits like no, I don't like a cursed horn, but then he's like, I thought this is a spare horn It's just my spare horn.

525
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,700
Rym: the first one fell off asshole.

526
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,120
Scott: But yeah, it shows funny like that.

527
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,487
Rym: I think Scott's favorite character still Takaoka the eagle.

528
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:33,620
Scott: the eagle who can't who has you know bad vision is the best is my.

529
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:40,508
Scott: You know, I guess I don't like him in the way that I like the the panther girl But he provides me the most humor.

530
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:41,852
Scott: cuz like, you know, he's.

531
00:36:41,872 --> 00:36:46,620
Scott: he's not stupid and he's just sort of normal But the only thing he sucks at is near-sightedness.

532
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,299
Scott: Otherwise, he's just sort of hanging out being cool being an eagle, you know.

533
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:58,378
Scott: but like he'll dive into the water like he's gonna get a fish and he'll be good at diving and He'll go into the water to come up with a straw man.

534
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:02,839
Rym: We got to make an animated gif of that straw man for the forum.

535
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,549
Scott: We do have to use that for the book.

536
00:37:04,629 --> 00:37:06,600
Rym: Let's don't forget the bear of sub siblings.

537
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:08,849
Scott: Well, but they're from another town so they don't suck.

538
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:12,664
Rym: I know but it's great cuz I come on a I love her.

539
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:16,240
Rym: when she shows up cuz her and the rabbit bond through muscles and fighting.

540
00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:23,152
Scott: Yeah, but the eagle like whenever something's going on It's like he knows like a smart thing to do like he.

541
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:26,709
Scott: so he's sort of like hey, you know wolf Let's team up on that rabbit and we can get him.

542
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:29,040
Scott: Oh, yeah, you know, that's sort of like the smart good idea.

543
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,568
Scott: It's just you know, he's near-sighted.

544
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:31,653
Scott: So it does doesn't work.

545
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:34,123
Rym: I Mean, I don't know what else we can say.

546
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:42,230
Rym: if you like a light-hearted cute fairly clever really short show I've you got 26 episodes of five minutes each.

547
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,743
Scott: you could watch this whole thing in a couple hours and you'll be done with it Forever.

548
00:37:45,884 --> 00:37:49,968
Scott: Well unless you want to watch it again because it's cute now You probably will be because we end up.

549
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,640
Rym: I keep watching the episodes again and again as we show them to people.

550
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:55,160
Scott: Yeah, the thing is on the crunchyroll so you can watch it there.

551
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,109
Scott: There's also a torrent.

552
00:37:56,391 --> 00:38:00,675
Scott: if you can help me out with that I think it's still going on my computer and a lot of it's on the YouTube.

553
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:08,800
Rym: so you can just get it there though Watch out because after a few episodes, the only thing left on YouTube are Russian subtitles or Spanish subtitles.

554
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,693
Scott: Yeah Crunchyroll has the the, you know, fully English subtitles.

555
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:18,880
Rym: as much as I dislike everything The crunchyroll is stands for and ever will be they do have the episodes available for watching.

556
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:23,486
Rym: So yeah, but I mean I guess if you like Ozumaga Daioh You'd probably like this show.

557
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:25,575
Scott: if you like risky safety apply like the show.

558
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,684
Rym: if you're human I mean, it's.

559
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:28,608
Rym: it's not like.

560
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:29,472
Rym: I'm not gonna pretend.

561
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:31,139
Rym: I mean we might be talking like this is not?

562
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,067
Scott: Yeah, this is not like high art.

563
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:36,120
Scott: This is not like a Kira Miyazaki level anime.

564
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:42,200
Scott: This is not the best anime in the world, but it's a cute funny show with good characters.

565
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,348
Rym: It is really cute.

566
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,039
Rym: And I think it's really funny.

567
00:38:45,642 --> 00:38:54,720
Scott: I think of another thing that really makes it funny and cute is in most shows Characters are drawn like seriously and then when something silly happens the characters will.

568
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:55,720
Rym: That's the best thing.

569
00:38:56,362 --> 00:39:00,880
Scott: The characters will super deform, you know, it's like, you know, you're watching slayers and everyone looks normal.

570
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,120
Scott: And then you know Leon inverse gets hit over the head.

571
00:39:04,502 --> 00:39:05,907
Rym: Yeah, that's the best scene in all the slaves.

572
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,154
Scott: yeah, then she's all super deformed with the koala action.

573
00:39:08,857 --> 00:39:15,199
Scott: but in this show Everyone is super deformed or at least relatively super deformed all the time because it's cute animal show.

574
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:19,616
Scott: But then what'll happen is they'll un-super deformed.

575
00:39:19,676 --> 00:39:20,660
Rym: They'll like be shownify.

576
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:28,400
Scott: Yeah They're like they'll get all serious and be shown in or like all pretty and girly Suddenly like they'll zoom in and their faces won't just be circles.

577
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:39,160
Scott: their faces will actually be like sort of serious anime faces and they'd be like, oh It's just it's a good change of pace is what I would say.

578
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,327
Rym: I'd recommend anyone who's an anime fan.

579
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:42,812
Rym: You have nothing to lose.

580
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:45,300
Rym: It's five minutes long.

581
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:56,360
Scott: Yeah, if I was an anime club what I would do is I would sort of show these maybe like, you know One or two per you know, anime club meeting like maybe one at the beginning and then maybe one like oh

582
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,666
Rym: I know what exactly what I do

583
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:00,400
Scott: in the middle of the showing - it sort of cleanses the anime pallet

584
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:07,800
Rym: Music videos, I'd probably show one episode of this every, you know every week or every whatever the anime club meets.

585
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:08,750
Scott: Yeah, it's a good one.

586
00:40:08,972 --> 00:40:09,962
Rym: Just one episode It's.

587
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:16,015
Scott: it's a good way to cleanse the anime pallet especially if you just watch something bad like say his eyes and Jotaro or something.

588
00:40:16,055 --> 00:40:18,626
Scott: then you can watch one of these and be like, ah, of course, we.

589
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:27,350
Rym: we did that or we attempted to do something like that way back when Aruda came out and We showed everyone the first episode of that.

590
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:29,600
Rym: they thought it was the hottest shit probably just cuz it was different.

591
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:32,679
Rym: Whoa, did that go downhill?

592
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:42,265
Rym: There have been shows that went downhill before but that show just not that it started very high to begin with but it went Like.

593
00:40:42,285 --> 00:40:43,660
Rym: you wouldn't think it could get worse.

594
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:50,194
Scott: But I mean you did have crazy rocket launcher action But that wasn't enough to make up for the CG worse than a PlayStation video game.

595
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:56,153
Rym: I Mean at least initial D had PlayStation 1 graphics early on.

596
00:40:56,273 --> 00:41:00,335
Scott: I know and think about that initial D had better Animation and graphics than urda.
