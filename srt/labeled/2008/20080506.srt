1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,245
Rym: It's Tuesday, May 6th.

2
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:12,027
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,674
Rym: I'm Scott and this is a geeky knives tonight.

4
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,720
Rym: Do we talk about to the Mario counter for the Wii?

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,931
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:35,880
Rym: I feel bad saying it again, but I'm really liking River City Ransom again.

7
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:38,389
Scott: Hey, when did you stop liking it?

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,935
Rym: I never stopped liking it.

9
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:41,200
Scott: How did you like it again?

10
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:46,226
Rym: It's more that it's a game that I know Possibly more so than most other games.

11
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:47,409
Rym: I've ever played a game that I've.

12
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:51,080
Rym: I've probably put more hours into that than many other games.

13
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:55,376
Scott: I actually I like River City Ransom a lot, but I haven't put that many hours into it.

14
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,179
Rym: Well, did you own it?

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,844
Rym: No, no, there you go.

16
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:09,980
Scott: I emulated it pretty much until now what I'm I guess Legally emulating it But I played it at a friend's house and I actually bought it like we got it when it came out.

17
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:13,539
Rym: It was expensive and that game was like the best game ever.

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:14,762
Scott: Yeah.

19
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:22,131
Scott: Yeah, that was the kind of game that was sorta, you know under the radar in my neck of the woods In my childhood days, which is pretty sad.

20
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:24,080
Rym: cuz what the hell games were you playing?

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,111
Scott: I probably would have played the hell out of it if I had it.

22
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:27,500
Rym: What were you playing?

23
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,904
Rym: Like what was your hot game then?

24
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:35,230
Scott: probably like Kung Fu Heroes wide series, which is good But it's not River City Ransom.

25
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,080
Scott: It's not so great, but it has the good music.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,153
Rym: Doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

27
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:45,180
Scott: compared to River City Ransom's music It's a little worse than that, but it's not bad.

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,234
Scott: I mean just because your music isn't as good as every city ran.

29
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:50,280
Scott: So doesn't mean your music's bad.

30
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:51,465
Rym: I don't know.

31
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:52,028
Rym: I might have to.

32
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:54,680
Scott: that's like just because you're not worth as much as gold.

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,996
Rym: You're poor pretty much at this point now.

34
00:01:58,237 --> 00:02:00,688
Rym: Yeah But tell us over the weekend.

35
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,120
Rym: We had the visigoths over played some Burning Wheel.

36
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:06,314
Scott: well anyway except for Scott I didn't play burning.

37
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,924
Scott: well I worked on shit for you people and for me.

38
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:13,641
Scott: so yeah you make a video yet um I'm getting I'm getting to it.

39
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:14,807
Rym: yeah we'll see.

40
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:18,145
Scott: hopefully this weekend this weekend for sure if it doesn't like rain or something.

41
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:21,866
Rym: but it was kind of like we had this sudden explosion of dungeon mastering or I guess.

42
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,040
Rym: I guess we've outgrown the term dungeon master.

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,074
Rym: I think we really have to say GM now because we play games.

44
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:33,358
Rym: in fact we still say yeah it's D&D weekend even though we're not playing D&D.

45
00:02:33,398 --> 00:02:43,195
Rym: we'll probably never play D&D again except to try out kind of maybe fourth edition so I can make the inevitable review if I don't have to buy the books.

46
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:48,959
Scott: you know I could do like D&D one-shot kind of deals if you know the time is right.

47
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:53,676
Scott: of course I'd rather do inspectors lacuna paranoia something else.

48
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:57,835
Rym: well it's funny because suddenly Scott's all about running a primetime adventure.

49
00:02:57,855 --> 00:03:00,188
Scott: well I realized well cuz I finally got all the books.

50
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:06,318
Scott: I just went out and I bought all the books for all those indie RPGs like and you know dogs in the vineyard.

51
00:03:06,338 --> 00:03:07,664
Scott: I'm a little tired night tonight.

52
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:12,767
Scott: dogs in the vineyard puppies for Satan kill puppies for Satan which is you know famous.

53
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:19,195
Rym: well kill puppies for Satan is one of those games like Hall where you don't actually want to play.

54
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:20,219
Scott: playing that at least once.

55
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,116
Rym: oh everyone says they'll play Hall at least once too and then they realize that there isn't really a game in there playing at least once.

56
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:31,462
Scott: if we played kobolds eat my babies once in a half times we're gonna play this getting something.

57
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:36,958
Rym: kobolds ate my babies had a rudimentary game system within.

58
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:40,793
Rym: this is a relatively short system yes but it's much longer.

59
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:47,047
Rym: of course it's not nearly as long as Hall no but anyway and if any of you want something fun to read you're into tabletop gaming.

60
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,305
Rym: I'd recommend picking up if you can find at the old source book for Hall.

61
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:52,695
Rym: it stands for human occupied landfill.

62
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:57,057
Rym: anyway you get one of those cameras on your head that blows up if it sees anything obscene.

63
00:03:57,398 --> 00:03:58,101
Rym: good luck peeing.

64
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:00,107
Scott: I'm gonna search for that on eBay right now.

65
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:09,056
Rym: but we realize that primetime adventures is pretty much the best way to run a besom game.

66
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:10,100
Rym: ever forget besom.

67
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:26,350
Scott: yeah I mean basically besom is an old role-playing game called it's B. it's called besom because it's B e SM big eyes small mouth and it's sort of it's the anime role-playing game like there's a try gun supplement and slayers supplement and a tenchi supplement.

68
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:38,972
Scott: right and the idea was that you buy this and you be able to roleplay as your favorite anime characters or in your favorite anime universes or in a generic anime universe like there are rules for giant robots and rules for magical girl.

69
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:39,736
Rym: now used to be.

70
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:43,117
Rym: I mean you know there's all the different kinds of I guess classes of role-playing systems.

71
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:53,884
Rym: it was the tristad system which wasn't that bad kind of simple but simple in the kind of AD&D way where there's a simple core mechanic and then a billion piles of shit all around it.

72
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:59,527
Rym: but I actually played a new tenant online role-playing game that used the same system and it worked okay.

73
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:04,488
Rym: but it was kind of like why I guess I didn't realize it way back then.

74
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:11,647
Rym: but yeah if you want to play an anime game you got to use besom and if you want to play a dungeon II game you got to use D&D and then now wait a minute.

75
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:19,094
Rym: why don't we just use primetime adventures to play an anime game present besom socks and d20 besoms?

76
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:19,657
Rym: even worse.

77
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:27,852
Scott: yeah primetime adventures is designed to be a role-playing game where you create a serial television show of either five or nine episodes.

78
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,739
Rym: huh television show.

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,307
Scott: why can't we just do an anime?

80
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:33,438
Scott: well the answer is there's no reason.

81
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:34,829
Scott: you can't absolutely can.

82
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:35,999
Scott: in fact that will be awesome.

83
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,605
Rym: besom didn't really create.

84
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:39,652
Rym: like an anime like game.

85
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:51,808
Scott: besom created an anime show but like stereotypes to 11 besom created basically a D&D game where you happen to be anime characters.

86
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,755
Rym: no you've ever played besom.

87
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:54,718
Scott: I read the book.

88
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:55,641
Rym: which book?

89
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:56,204
Rym: d20?

90
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:58,393
Scott: I don't know I don't remember.

91
00:05:58,735 --> 00:05:59,739
Scott: it was a book I said besom on.

92
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,482
Scott: it was in the bathroom.

93
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:11,027
Rym: well besom you realize that people a lot of people play d20 besom which is just the same old crappy D&D three-point whatever edition but they skin it with anime cliches.

94
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:14,724
Scott: the original besom system at least the Star Wars d20 changed some shit up.

95
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:21,533
Scott: not much no but it added some shit on like the force and the ships and the such but it was all just for combat.

96
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:22,578
Scott: I know of course.

97
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:26,558
Scott: yeah well it's d20 but they don't have any other non rules for non combat.

98
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:26,960
Scott: what man?

99
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:35,553
Rym: at least back in the a D&D days they didn't pretend I mean what you had proficiencies and then you had non weapon proficiencies.

100
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:39,105
Rym: yeah but the original besom was just.

101
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:43,504
Rym: it played up the anime stereotypes but it did it in kind of a crappy way.

102
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:48,084
Rym: so why not just use a system that plays up stereotypes in general and run with it?

103
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:54,767
Scott: yeah yeah apparently hall came out in 94 but there was a reprint a newer edition in o2.

104
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:58,925
Scott: oh we we yeah and I had no idea me and this looking pretty.

105
00:06:58,965 --> 00:06:59,650
Scott: maybe we should get it.

106
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:00,134
Scott: it's weird.

107
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:08,463
Rym: it's like me and Scott Johnson were the only people in the crew who remembered hall because I forget which one of us but one day I was like one of us said blah blah blah blah blah haha.

108
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:11,420
Rym: that's just like hall and the other one went haha and everyone else went.

109
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,344
Scott: what all right eBay.

110
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:14,627
Scott: old version $2 not bad.

111
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,230
Rym: new version $9.

112
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,193
Scott: by now $13.

113
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:21,723
Rym: I think I prefer the old version.

114
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:29,668
Scott: crazy Igor is selling one for 23 21. great anyway all right you want to go to the news action?

115
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,412
Rym: I don't know.

116
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,664
Rym: my story was just that we had this explosion.

117
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,218
Rym: cuz Scott wants to run that game and I was.

118
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:41,327
Rym: I've been planning in building this gigantic Horatio horn blower style Napoleonic Wars burning wheel game.

119
00:07:41,388 --> 00:07:51,896
Rym: but I've been running into the fact that because I'm not using medieval setting I'm kind of having to write a lot of game mechanics and make you know an entire working balanced system of life pads.

120
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,767
Rym: I got about a third of the way through that and said fuck this and I'm just gonna run a standard burning wheel game.

121
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:58,519
Scott: yeah you could do blossoms are falling.

122
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:08,163
Rym: I'm telling you no because one most of the people in our group have just barely barely gotten to the point where they're not completely just blindsided by burning wheel.

123
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:11,981
Rym: I'm not gonna introduce a completely different system on top of that.

124
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:13,429
Scott: yeah it's not completely different.

125
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:19,962
Rym: it's burning wheel plus plus a bunch of stuff that people aren't quite fully together with the whole doula witch thing.

126
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:25,406
Rym: so I'm not gonna introduce language mechanics all right but suffice to say I totally copped out.

127
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:32,635
Rym: and yeah my setting is yeah if you read the prince of nothing yeah holy war we're marching on shimmy go nuts.

128
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:34,621
Rym: great three to five life paths.

129
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,485
Rym: let's see what happens.

130
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:39,035
Scott: okay so news time I guess.

131
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,821
Rym: oh you're really dragging.

132
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,675
Scott: yeah wake up I saw the sleep on the choo-choo.

133
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,120
Rym: how could you be so tired?

134
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,907
Rym: you wake up hours after me.

135
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,276
Rym: you go to sleep early.

136
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:51,400
Scott: I gotta sleep way after you.

137
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,183
Rym: how about you?

138
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:53,829
Rym: how much sleep did you get last night?

139
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,037
Scott: less than six hours.

140
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,908
Rym: I get less than six hours almost every night.

141
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,156
Rym: anyway I'm on my mind.

142
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:03,023
Rym: my a penis is bigger than yours.

143
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,551
Rym: my stay up late college penis.

144
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:05,978
Rym: look how big it is.

145
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,223
Scott: that's not a good thing.

146
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:10,334
Scott: it's like a hideous hideous.

147
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:11,619
Rym: you know it's funny.

148
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:17,796
Rym: it's like that thread in the forum where people are talking about yeah I pulled an all-nighter and I thought back to yeah I used to pull all-nighters.

149
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:24,683
Scott: I used to pull all-nighters for when like something gets like you know when like your skin is swollen it's small it's hideous swollen mess.

150
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:43,611
Scott: but yeah all-nighters are not so much the funny to talk about but for real not funny.

151
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:53,675
Rym: anyway I remember we used to pull all-nighters for the hell of it in college like hey you want to watch cowboy bebop until we're done hells.

152
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:55,926
Scott: yeah well it was just like hey let's watch some cowboy bebop.

153
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:57,796
Scott: oh shit we watch it all fuck yeah.

154
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:03,624
Rym: but sometimes we say hey let's just stay up all night for no good reason and very rarely did good come of that.

155
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:05,274
Rym: no usually you know what came of that.

156
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,589
Rym: I missed the next three days of classes and I felt like shit for another week.

157
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:12,264
Scott: alright so news time what do you got?

158
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,483
Scott: oh boy there was the news a long time ago like Steven Spielberg's making a game.

159
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:21,004
Rym: I'd completely ignored it because why is Steven Spielberg's name on a game?

160
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:26,314
Scott: to sell it up of course because even if the game is terrible people might buy it based on the name and they could charge more for it.

161
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,645
Scott: oh you moved.

162
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:36,113
Scott: and then the news is like oh Steven Spielberg making an EA game like okay whatever it seems we're making an EA Wii game.

163
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,966
Scott: I'm like oh whatever it'll be interesting to see what it is.

164
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,173
Scott: well it's out.

165
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:41,480
Scott: now you can buy it in the store.

166
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:44,133
Scott: it's called boom blocks but the arcade was about.

167
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:51,444
Rym: yeah this game had completely fallen off my radar until I read penny arcade I was like oh yeah the game showed up.

168
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:53,211
Scott: I like two weeks ago or so.

169
00:10:53,231 --> 00:11:00,925
Scott: I first realized that it existed and I was and I saw a video of it and I was like you know that actually looks like a really fun game.

170
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:02,352
Scott: and then I went an Amazon.

171
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:03,477
Scott: I said I'll buy that game.

172
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,875
Scott: it's at $50 and I'm like okay it's fun doesn't look $50?

173
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,625
Scott: fun you know and it'll be just as fun later as it is now.

174
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:22,793
Scott: so when Mario Kart is sort of worn out when Okami is worn out when Smash Brothers is worn out and there's a game trout I'll probably try to pick up bloom box for hopefully less than $30.

175
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:24,581
Rym: it's definitely one of those.

176
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:30,353
Rym: you got a bunch of people over I'd say a party and half the people will kind of crowd around the Wii and play that game.

177
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,280
Rym: will the other half the people?

178
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:33,773
Rym: I don't know go do whatever other people at parties do?

179
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:43,778
Scott: you aren't me sitting in front of the Wii but if you're if you're looking for a Wii party game this one looks like a high quality that will hold you over for quite a while.

180
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,526
Rym: one could almost say pry epic.

181
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:48,820
Scott: yeah after the Mario Kart and the Smash Brothers are worn out.

182
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,604
Scott: this is where to go.

183
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:53,365
Rym: I don't know if Mario Kart is gonna get worn out any time.

184
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:54,209
Scott: I didn't say soon.

185
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:56,299
Scott: I said when it could be next year like four years.

186
00:11:56,319 --> 00:12:00,423
Scott: I mean it's gonna take a long time for the price of this game to go down from 50 to $30.

187
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:00,905
Scott: right?

188
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:05,165
Scott: so you know that's you know in Mario Kart and Smash Brothers are gonna last a lot longer than that.

189
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:08,943
Rym: so anyway oh well so there wasn't much gaming news I really cared about.

190
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:14,606
Rym: but now I realized something by going to Kotaku because I needed some news and there was nothing.

191
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:20,290
Rym: Wolfenstein the original FPS and someone's gonna mean Wolfenstein 3d.

192
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:24,490
Rym: well someone is immediately going to nitpick and say I wasn't the first F yet.

193
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:25,757
Rym: no it was the first FPS.

194
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:28,287
Rym: as far as anyone who cares is concerned that's right.

195
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:32,141
Scott: it's also the best FPS ever but it wasn't.

196
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:35,959
Rym: it was barely an FPS was awful shut up even when it came out.

197
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:37,544
Rym: I remember playing it as a kid.

198
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:39,831
Rym: it's beyond and thinking bad.

199
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:42,882
Rym: Wow this is almost a good game.

200
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,300
Rym: good and if only someone would take this idea and make a game with it.

201
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:54,011
Scott: go to see it's a great game.

202
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:59,463
Rym: play it well I'm gonna go play Wolfenstein right after the show.

203
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:00,307
Rym: no you're not.

204
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,237
Rym: yeah how you gonna change the controls?

205
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:05,029
Scott: I'm gonna use my little gamepad or use the mouse and keyboard.

206
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,937
Rym: I will see anyway box.

207
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,971
Rym: so Wolfenstein whatever it was the first FPS.

208
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:10,373
Rym: I can.

209
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:14,208
Rym: I contend that doom was the first I guess modern FPS.

210
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,479
Scott: I think quake 1 was the first modern FPS.

211
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:21,377
Rym: I don't know because the thing is doom was almost ahead of its time and that it was.

212
00:13:21,397 --> 00:13:24,714
Rym: they couldn't really have the technology to make a fully 3d game yet.

213
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:33,429
Rym: so they made basically a three-dimensional game where it was actually two-dimensional and then the third dimension was just an integer.

214
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,317
Rym: and then they use clever tricks to use that integer to determine height and it it works really well.

215
00:13:39,337 --> 00:13:41,105
Scott: you didn't have to game up and down.

216
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,314
Scott: it was not a modern FPS.

217
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:45,503
Rym: all right all right it was the precursor to them.

218
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:48,598
Rym: it was the first good FPS Wolfenstein 3d.

219
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:51,068
Scott: well the thing is Wolfenstein 3d was just a maze game.

220
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:53,840
Scott: it's amazing game fighting an FPS really.

221
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,635
Scott: I mean I had an FP and s-ing but it was mostly a maze.

222
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,723
Scott: find the secrets collect the treasure game.

223
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:04,160
Rym: yes go up to every picture of Hitler in its spacebar.

224
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,820
Scott: they go every slide along every single wall there possibly was and push the spacebar.

225
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,181
Rym: they do made the much better mechanic of jousting by wall running along the walls.

226
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:19,443
Rym: deathmatch yeah see it's the first real FPS because it was the first game that had deathmatch.

227
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:22,292
Scott: no no no you know.

228
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:27,049
Rym: actually I realize now that there are really make death matches anymore.

229
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:29,801
Scott: I played the half-life 2 deathmatch this week.

230
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,517
Rym: plays it though I try looked and there's like hardly any server.

231
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:33,222
Scott: I played in there.

232
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:34,693
Scott: plenty of servers we talking about.

233
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:35,700
Scott: there's plenty of people playing.

234
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,671
Rym: oh yeah but not as many as you'd expect.

235
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,621
Scott: no that not a whole bunch but there's plenty.

236
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:41,510
Rym: and you know what really saddens me though.

237
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:42,977
Rym: I turned on ricochet.

238
00:14:43,378 --> 00:14:47,209
Rym: there was exactly one server that a ping of like 800.

239
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:52,365
Rym: I went there there was one bot and the bot was broken.

240
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,758
Rym: it was like the saddest experience of my life.

241
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,212
Scott: sad we should play some ricochet with the foreign peoples.

242
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:00,243
Rym: yeah ricochet is a damn good game.

243
00:15:00,263 --> 00:15:02,813
Scott: you have half-life 1 you have ricochet.

244
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:03,877
Scott: it's in steam.

245
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,086
Scott: it shouldn't be cost any money I don't think.

246
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:10,383
Rym: but yeah today is the 16th anniversary of wolfin Stein 3d.

247
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,972
Scott: I'm 10 years older than Wolfenstein.

248
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,864
Rym: Wow I'm also 10 years older than Wolfenstein.

249
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:19,374
Scott: I guess Wolfenstein came out in 1992 something like that.

250
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:29,360
Rym: yeah wow it's amazing how quickly these things advance like that was then and it wasn't that long after the doom came out and then doom - well think about this.

251
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,803
Scott: Wolfenstein was 1992 right.

252
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:31,885
Scott: the end 64 I think was 1994.

253
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:52,109
Rym: by then 1996 I think by then pretty much from 1994 and a half was when I basically became a full-on PC gamer and I gave up on consoles and I continued to be given up on consoles right up until the end of the GameCube era.

254
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:52,792
Scott: yeah the end 64 was 96.

255
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:59,157
Rym: no you don't know I didn't really get back into console gaming until the DS came out.

256
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,168
Rym: when the DS came out I bought it.

257
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:07,267
Rym: it was the first console I owned since the SNES and the PlayStation was 94.

258
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:20,089
Scott: the end 64 is 96. so think about that in relation to Wolfenstein 3d in 92. whoa things in the 90s gaming basically within the span of 10 years went from - holy shit.

259
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,901
Scott: and it was really fast like it really felt like the.

260
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:25,674
Scott: you know the each system like lasted forever.

261
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:29,012
Rym: you know the only thing that didn't last forever was quake 1.

262
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:34,033
Rym: I remember playing quake 1 and then someone was like here's quake 2 the first good real.

263
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,399
Rym: finally it's here.

264
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,106
Rym: this is what an FPS should be.

265
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:42,931
Scott: yeah but yeah that's the in the night and like the 90s or remember it changed so fast.

266
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:49,094
Rym: that's dire battle between all that and Duke Nukem 3d which was actually when he damn good game.

267
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:56,885
Scott: when quake 1 and Duke Nukem 3d came out there was actually every game magazine was like Duke Nukem 3d or quake 1 which one is.

268
00:16:56,926 --> 00:17:04,497
Scott: Duke Nukem 3d was infinitely better and technology wise it wasn't really but the deathmatch was game wise it was.

269
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:07,592
Rym: the only problem with the deathmatch was no one else owned that game.

270
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:11,413
Rym: so despite my cable modem I was pretty much forced to play against bots.

271
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:18,258
Rym: and I can tell you one thing in that game bots were basically insta kills if they saw you.

272
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:19,522
Rym: it was not fun yeah.

273
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:21,635
Scott: and then unreal sort of came along.

274
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:31,328
Rym: it was like this you know the second runner for a long time like my brother and I would start up a Wolfenstein 3d game and it'd be us and a bunch of bots and it would degenerate immediately into the game.

275
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:32,332
Rym: yeah Duke Nukem 3d?

276
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:32,473
Rym: yeah.

277
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:38,033
Rym: it'd be him and me like hiding in the bathroom praying to God that the boss didn't find us.

278
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,449
Rym: yeah but that's you hear him walking around.

279
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:43,804
Scott: that's why Duke Nukem Forever gets all this hype.

280
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:46,883
Scott: you know it's because that game didn't come out when it was supposed to.

281
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:50,239
Scott: it was probably the only reason that quake succeeded so much.

282
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:56,370
Scott: if that if Duke Nukem Forever would have come out on schedule quake 2 would have met with actual serious competition.

283
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,983
Rym: what if team forgers 2 and come out when they said it would have?

284
00:17:59,184 --> 00:18:00,833
Rym: holy shit that would have.

285
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:09,168
Rym: I think gaming would have gone a different way FPS wise because that game was a lot more like the weapons factory mega TF kind of game than what we got instead.

286
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,722
Rym: yeah alright anyway that's all I got.

287
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:15,357
Rym: I don't know Scott's tired and there wasn't so much gaming news.

288
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:24,033
Rym: the matters are not really so.

289
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:24,795
Rym: what else to do?

290
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,517
Rym: but things of the day.

291
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,582
Rym: it's not really a cop out here.

292
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:34,766
Rym: but quest for glory - oh if you like those old man it's just old dogs day with you isn't it?

293
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:39,770
Rym: if you like those old kind of point-and-click or type what your character does games.

294
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:47,281
Rym: I think that quest for glory - really perfect as an Asterix quest or quest for asterisk yeah those kinds of game any game.

295
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:50,553
Scott: with the word quest in the title I mean King's Quest.

296
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:52,279
Rym: I'll admit this.

297
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,733
Rym: I thought King's Quest one was pretty pretty poop.

298
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:59,053
Scott: King's Quest one is pretty poop and this quest is not poop police quest.

299
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:02,106
Scott: however King's Quest 4 was actually pretty good.

300
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:02,769
Rym: it was okay.

301
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,215
Scott: space quest is okay please.

302
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:06,564
Rym: quest games had the the one flaw of.

303
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:18,636
Rym: I had to drive my car everywhere in real time and it was really hard because that was I think that game at the worst interface between a human being and a vehicle that any game has ever had.

304
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:22,948
Scott: the only thing I love about police because he had that elevator in the police station that would only go to certain places.

305
00:19:22,968 --> 00:19:29,005
Scott: it could go to other places I know but like you knew that when you could get to those other floors that would be the business you'd go up there.

306
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:31,659
Rym: the doors locked you knock they're like no one answers.

307
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,872
Rym: you try every item you have and everything in the room.

308
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:40,368
Rym: finally the game is like listen dude you're supposed to come back here when the plot advances now go out and arrest that drug dealer who if?

309
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:47,062
Rym: or that the drunk driver who if you'd handcuff him in front instead of behind he kills you and drives away in the police car.

310
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:55,191
Rym: that game was procedural but anyway quest for glory - in terms of the games of type what your character does.

311
00:19:55,272 --> 00:20:00,191
Rym: maybe not the kind of better click interface they had later but like drink the blah.

312
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,656
Rym: ask about the blah.

313
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:04,347
Rym: I think this was the best one from that era.

314
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,994
Rym: it's super fun.

315
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,783
Scott: it's the best one maybe with graphics.

316
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:09,152
Scott: there are a lot that didn't have graphics.

317
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,786
Rym: oh no text adventures are a different genre altogether.

318
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,593
Scott: this is the same game.

319
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,040
Scott: it is a text adventure.

320
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,691
Scott: the only difference is that this has pictures.

321
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:19,620
Rym: there's a lot more than that.

322
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,609
Rym: you actually also controlled your guy.

323
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,249
Rym: wait like on the screen graphically in combat was actually super fun uh-huh.

324
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:37,975
Rym: and real-time okay now like quest for glory 3 where they play text adventures the real-time combat yeah but this was better believe me believe me plus I remember moon missed.

325
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:46,094
Rym: all I do is type kill so-and-so I killed a butler and it would say but you don't have the aerosol device to which I think wait a minute aerosol device.

326
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:48,323
Rym: of course I don't have the aerosol device.

327
00:20:48,685 --> 00:20:50,432
Rym: where can I get me an aerosol device?

328
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:54,748
Rym: yeah use aerosol device on Butler but you don't have the aerosol device.

329
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,977
Rym: damn it all right.

330
00:20:57,358 --> 00:21:00,972
Rym: but quest for glory 2 is is the best of these games.

331
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:08,119
Rym: and if you don't want to go through the trouble of playing this game because you can it works perfectly in DOS box.

332
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,286
Scott: I took Rym's old floppy disk and I ran them in DOS box and it worked perfectly and the game is really fun.

333
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:15,038
Rym: like if you like that sort of thing this game is great.

334
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:27,296
Rym: but if not I submit to you a video that includes the somewhat famous or infamous dance scene and the panel kinda gamers that I remember.

335
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:28,700
Rym: people met on the bbs's.

336
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,511
Rym: people made a big deal about that dancing but then also it's just all the cup scenes and kind of the coolness from the game.

337
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:37,883
Rym: but really this game is actually good.

338
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:45,096
Rym: so I recommend playing it if you really want to get a feel for like what games were like back then and I'll leave it at that also.

339
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:46,622
Rym: I really like that music.

340
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:55,210
Scott: ok so last week I did a thing of the day about a webcomic that I never read and you know I read it and it was ok.

341
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:55,994
Scott: it was.

342
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,379
Scott: it's a good it's good comic.

343
00:21:57,862 --> 00:21:58,545
Scott: you are so little.

344
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:05,136
Scott: the colors in the art are really great the arts a little off but it's still really pretty awesome and I'm glad I made it a thing of the day.

345
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:11,388
Scott: so because that worked out so well I have no problem doing yet another thing of the day of something that I have never read.

346
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:13,417
Rym: how this is gonna be great.

347
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:23,068
Scott: so someone who I trust their opinion one of our listeners on the indie RPG scene right told me about this RPG called fate.

348
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,245
Scott: right and I think fate stands for something I forget.

349
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:40,074
Rym: yeah way to go fantastic adventures in tabletop entertainment alright alright I'll go with that.

350
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:44,874
Scott: and the third version of the fate system is available completely for free.

351
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:50,493
Scott: just go to the website you get it a whole RPG a whole indie RPG an award-winning indie RPG.

352
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:52,941
Rym: what awards did win?

353
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:56,474
Rym: because there are awards like most unplayable game out there.

354
00:22:56,956 --> 00:23:03,119
Scott: well ok the second edition of fate right one third place for indie RPG of the year.

355
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:05,007
Scott: for first place for best support.

356
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,037
Scott: Andy's choice what year?

357
00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:08,666
Scott: and it was the best free game of the year in.

358
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:10,720
Scott: oh three this is version two that we're talking about.

359
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,934
Scott: huh and this is version three and version three is free.

360
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:23,208
Scott: it's based on the open gaming license version of fudge I guess fudge with some other RPG and it is a free indie RPG.

361
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:34,320
Scott: so like if you don't have monies to buy like all these little indie $20 RPG books or if you're not sure like if you want to really get into the indie RPG scene with the burning wheels and that sort of thing.

362
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,312
Scott: right this is totally free it costs nothing.

363
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:44,639
Scott: and I'm pretty confident even though I've never read it that this is a better RPG than Dungeons & Dragons.

364
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:54,158
Scott: so if Dungeons & Dragons is all you know of tabletop role-playing game or if you nothing of tabletop role-playing game go download this and read this one and it.

365
00:23:55,101 --> 00:24:03,059
Scott: I'm sure it has some of the redeeming qualities of quality RPGs and you will you will learn something from it without having to spend any money whatsoever.

366
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:10,808
Scott: and there's actually a couple of actual games you know built on the system like they had this spirit of the century game.

367
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,779
Scott: that's like a pulp action thingy.

368
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:21,252
Scott: it's like sort of Indiana Jonesy like on the cover there's a. it's a spirit of the century a pulp pickup role-playing game.

369
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,727
Scott: there's like a guy hanging on to a biplane that's being flown by a gorilla.

370
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:29,163
Scott: I feel like a flaming zeppelin and a guy with a jetpack.

371
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:30,509
Rym: I feel like two things.

372
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,920
Rym: one you know what I'll save all that for.

373
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:43,230
Rym: when we talk about some of these indie RPGs on another show mm-hmm partly because I want to despite everything we talked about prior let's talk about a video game that was released in the last decade.

374
00:24:43,572 --> 00:24:46,266
Scott: yeah I know but yes that's my thing of day all right.

375
00:24:46,306 --> 00:24:47,211
Scott: so hate RPG.

376
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:53,135
Rym: speaking of a video game that was released in the past decade give or take Mario Kart.

377
00:24:53,176 --> 00:24:55,104
Scott: you want to talk about just the new Mario Kart.

378
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:56,430
Scott: you want to talk about Mario karts.

379
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,122
Rym: uh I think we can talk about him real quick.

380
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:07,124
Rym: more than a decade ago in fact in 1992 Mario Kart appear Mario Kart.

381
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:10,940
Rym: there was never a Mario Kart whatever on the SNES and you know what.

382
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:14,492
Rym: it was a pretty mediocre game.

383
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:17,987
Scott: see the thing is right nowadays you try to play that game and it's pretty painful.

384
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:20,742
Scott: I mean they had the picking up coins on the track.

385
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:21,405
Scott: business dude.

386
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:24,159
Rym: I rented that game like right after it came out.

387
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,445
Scott: it was actually they had the.

388
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:31,636
Scott: you know the power slide but it was really hard to do and you know it wasn't really easy to control or that useful.

389
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:36,143
Scott: you're a lot better off actually letting go the accelerator and turning a lot of times and we

390
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:45,454
Rym: did with my brother and I played the battle like three times tried to raise decided the game was pretty poop and just it actually sat there unplayed until my parents took it back to blockbuster.

391
00:25:45,475 --> 00:25:46,541
Scott: I played it at a friend's house.

392
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,291
Rym: all right I'm sorry mammoth video.

393
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:48,875
Scott: yeah I went.

394
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:50,082
Scott: I played it at a friend's house.

395
00:25:50,102 --> 00:25:52,799
Scott: he had it and at first like I was just falling all over the place.

396
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:56,622
Scott: but he had figured it out and then eventually I figured it out and then it was good times.

397
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,867
Scott: but you know it wasn't.

398
00:25:58,088 --> 00:25:58,810
Scott: it wasn't easy.

399
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,300
Scott: the controls were very unrefined.

400
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:07,402
Scott: but for what it was you know an actual racing game that nominally worked with the items.

401
00:26:07,804 --> 00:26:09,190
Scott: it was pretty hot in those days.

402
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,527
Rym: thing is nowadays pretty unplayable while lacking the items.

403
00:26:12,668 --> 00:26:14,981
Rym: even then I would have rather played stunts 40 racing.

404
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:16,245
Rym: anyway that game was great.

405
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:20,918
Scott: so then the GBA one was the next one.

406
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:26,017
Rym: oh no Mario Kart 64 came out in 96 if I was a freshman in high school.

407
00:26:26,438 --> 00:26:28,687
Scott: so when did the GBA one come out?

408
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,232
Rym: 2001 while we were all in school.

409
00:26:30,413 --> 00:26:31,356
Rym: oh wow yeah.

410
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,270
Rym: so anyway yeah Mario Kart cuz I remember you all got it.

411
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,758
Rym: I didn't have a Gameboy Advance yet.

412
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:43,006
Scott: yeah Mario Kart 64. actually it had a lot of interesting maps and it actually had you know decent driving mechanics.

413
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:49,674
Scott: but actually I think it's actually actually I think it's the worst Mario Kart I don't know.

414
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:53,070
Scott: yeah probably because first of all the AI just cheated like.

415
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:56,087
Scott: it's not like now where they get you with the blue shell and then catch up.

416
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:57,233
Scott: they just cheated.

417
00:26:57,253 --> 00:27:00,568
Scott: they were just faster than you to make it hard because they sucked all right.

418
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:16,784
Scott: and not only that but like the actual power sliding mechanic I mean in the DS it was pretty bad with the snaking but the n64 was really really bad and there were a lot of broken maps like you could jump over the wall and it was like it's not like it was supposed to be a shortcut.

419
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:21,002
Scott: it was like just bullshit and just broken and it was kind of hackneyed.

420
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,288
Rym: yeah and I never.

421
00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:24,015
Rym: I've never played that Mario Kart.

422
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:30,043
Rym: cuz remember by 96 I'd given up on consoles I had my rockin game in PC and I was just playing nothing.

423
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:34,948
Rym: but like I don't know whatever game I was playing it made for a good multiplayer party.

424
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:39,467
Scott: but in all honesty if you want a multiplayer party on the n64 you want Goldeneye.

425
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:46,369
Scott: no Diddy car in racing Diddy Kong racing as far as superior far superior you can race in Goldeneye.

426
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:58,607
Scott: I guess I guess I guess the GBA one came out and I played that GBA Mario Kart like a fiend like I don't think you people understand how good.

427
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:05,756
Rym: I have no idea this way this game Scott is to this game more so than I am to Advance Wars like like.

428
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:12,931
Rym: I picked it up one day I borrowed his card and I've went to raise one of his ghosts and I was like all right go his ghost was gone.

429
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:24,013
Scott: I never saw it again and then it let me yep I think like I played that GBA Mario Kart on my GBA so much I think I honestly think I might be the world champion of that game.

430
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:28,055
Scott: like it had all the SNES maps and it had a whole bunch of new GBA maps.

431
00:28:28,095 --> 00:28:29,543
Scott: so there's like a ton of maps right.

432
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:30,668
Scott: it was wicked awesome.

433
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,830
Scott: and the other thing about that game is that I don't know why they changed.

434
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,838
Scott: they had the formula perfect right.

435
00:28:37,858 --> 00:28:43,403
Scott: the game had the blue shell right but the blue shell didn't fly through the sky and then land on your head.

436
00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:56,214
Scott: the blue shell just followed you and if you didn't mess up like if you kept driving and didn't like slow down by driving in some like dirt or if you stayed on the track it would never.

437
00:28:56,254 --> 00:29:05,372
Scott: it would always stay right behind you but it wouldn't actually hit you and if you were able to keep driving perfectly long enough it would go away.

438
00:29:05,673 --> 00:29:25,096
Scott: the same thing with the red shells and this resulted in a completely skill-based Mario Kart that still managed to have all the fun of having crazy items without having them ruin the skill based gameplay because people could use items on you all they wanted but if you were awesome you could dodge pretty much all of them.

439
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:28,674
Scott: I mean sometimes there'd be something like a blue shells coming your dot.

440
00:29:28,694 --> 00:29:32,134
Scott: you're staying out of its way you're staying out of its way and then lightning.

441
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:35,678
Scott: you got small and now it hits you but you already got lightning so it's like our whatever.

442
00:29:35,698 --> 00:29:36,482
Rym: yeah but it was.

443
00:29:36,743 --> 00:29:38,893
Rym: it was a solid game all around it was.

444
00:29:39,315 --> 00:29:42,170
Scott: it was pretty much the perfect Mario Kart as far as I'm concerned.

445
00:29:42,211 --> 00:30:00,650
Scott: a shit ton of tracks excellent character selection perfect controls almost entirely skill based in determining the winning and losing and I played it so much that I can pretty much get like amazing times and all the tracks especially scary especially like there's some like Bowser castle tracks.

446
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:05,431
Scott: I'm just like like going around like and that's also the first one that had the blue sparks.

447
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,643
Scott: I mean the n64 had like the power slide.

448
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:17,645
Scott: this one had it where you would do sort of a normal slide around the corner and if you took the corner like on the line that the game wanted you to take it on.

449
00:30:17,906 --> 00:30:19,775
Scott: it would just like blue sparks out of nowhere.

450
00:30:20,037 --> 00:30:26,990
Scott: it's like you do a turn you go to the straightaway and then boom blue sparks just poop and I liked it that way because it wasn't like.

451
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,947
Scott: you know try to hold the power slide as long as you want it wasn't?

452
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:31,710
Scott: you know?

453
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,525
Scott: you know try to rock back and forth to build anything up.

454
00:30:35,685 --> 00:30:42,396
Scott: it was take the turns as best as you can and if you take the turn in the best possible way then you'll just get a boost.

455
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,473
Scott: and it was only on the turns and I don't see how it could be better than that.

456
00:30:47,076 --> 00:30:49,063
Rym: so then double - which I'll admit.

457
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:56,420
Rym: I'm glad Nintendo tried an experiment like this but I didn't enjoy double - at least not the kind of two people in one cart mechanic.

458
00:30:56,922 --> 00:31:05,463
Rym: basically whenever we played it was either Scott's driving or I'm driving and whoever's not driving will never drive because the other person is never gonna switch.

459
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:07,011
Rym: there's no reason to ever switch.

460
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:09,042
Scott: pretty much all that going in the back.

461
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:11,756
Scott: I mean they did give the person in the back of the car.

462
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:15,676
Rym: yes they gave me the power to knock you off the track whenever I got bored.

463
00:31:15,696 --> 00:31:22,924
Scott: pretty much that person is in charge of the drift controls and the items which is good but it's not enough.

464
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:27,906
Scott: it's sort of like the person driving is the real play and the other person sort of bored.

465
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:29,593
Rym: it was really the.

466
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:33,553
Rym: the one thing I can really say about that game though is that they polished a lot of other things.

467
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:40,184
Rym: it was nominally fun if you're playing by yourself but it does have the benefit of if you have a group of like.

468
00:31:40,547 --> 00:31:52,214
Rym: like say you got two couples because you could do the land mode on that too like a gamer guy and a gamer girl and then they're two not so gamer girlfriend and let's just say both girlfriends now sexist.

469
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:56,810
Scott: how so saying the girlfriends are like not able to play the quality game.

470
00:31:57,171 --> 00:32:05,142
Rym: I said a gamer girl and a gamer guy and then both of their respective girlfriends who are not gamers.

471
00:32:05,242 --> 00:32:06,125
Scott: I was I'm tired.

472
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:10,461
Rym: I very pointedly did not go into the realm of girls suck games.

473
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:13,686
Rym: I went into the realm of lesbians but anyway.

474
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:23,984
Rym: so the non gamers could at least you know you could.

475
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:28,205
Rym: you could put the non gamer in the backseat and they could enjoy themselves.

476
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:35,664
Rym: of course they might screw you up though yeah but both people at an equal handicap and it was kind of this that is a good game to get people into gaming.

477
00:32:35,684 --> 00:32:37,251
Rym: you aren't so hard car.

478
00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:38,678
Scott: the thing is you could play.

479
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:44,250
Scott: if I'm not mistaken you could play Double Dash where each person drives and does the items and the drift out.

480
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,300
Scott: they control the whole vehicle.

481
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:47,512
Rym: oh yeah but I just I had other things to do.

482
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:52,037
Rym: that was when we were in college and we had much more important games to be playing like Counter Strike.

483
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:55,879
Scott: I get a lot of GameCube games pretty much most of the big ones but I don't have that one.

484
00:32:56,201 --> 00:33:02,389
Rym: so yeah well with Counter Strike and tribes to and other things to do that that was much earlier than Double Dash.

485
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:05,183
Rym: yeah but I'm saying like that level of game yeah.

486
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:08,475
Scott: and yes yep that was around Double Dash times.

487
00:33:08,636 --> 00:33:12,531
Rym: so we don't need to say much about the DS show on the DS one.

488
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:13,173
Rym: I think we did.

489
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:17,195
Rym: it was great except for the fact that one day I was playing against Scott.

490
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:21,827
Rym: you know he beat me all the time and then I was like wait a minute I beat him all the time because I was playing it the same way.

491
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:29,202
Rym: I played the GBA one and I was trying to take his lines and then I was like huh wait a minute I could boost twice around that corner.

492
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:31,333
Rym: oh I wonder if I can boost three times.

493
00:33:31,353 --> 00:33:33,262
Rym: I wonder if I can boost down the straightaway.

494
00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:42,017
Rym: and I learned independently of other people how to snake and then I realized online that oh people are talking about snaking.

495
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:45,072
Rym: they had a name for it and people wrote an uproar about it.

496
00:33:45,514 --> 00:33:51,942
Rym: and then I realized that the way to get the best times was to hurt my thumb and kind of shake my DS and then I stop playing it.

497
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:52,887
Scott: yeah cuz pretty much.

498
00:33:52,947 --> 00:34:11,891
Scott: the problem with that game is they wanted to continue the the thing for the GBA version of you know rewarding you by taking the turns really well and by power sliding around the turns right and taking a good corner and drifting by giving you a boost right and that's all well and good with the blue sparks.

499
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:12,678
Scott: that's how it should be.

500
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:14,346
Scott: that's what makes Mario Kart Mario Kart.

501
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:16,918
Scott: the problem was is the way they programmed.

502
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:23,320
Scott: it was you got the sparks by sort of rocking the stick back and forth while drifting.

503
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,246
Scott: it's on a turn.

504
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:26,752
Scott: it didn't matter what.

505
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:30,185
Scott: so you would just do that wherever there was enough room on the track.

506
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:42,206
Rym: I was just I'd go drift rock rock rock and I got into this rhythm and I remember I finally raced against Scott doing this and we were on think Luigi's Mansion and it was like go and I just disappeared and I laughed.

507
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:43,190
Rym: it was just crazy.

508
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,717
Scott: and you know that's that's you know?

509
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:45,744
Scott: I guess that's okay.

510
00:34:45,804 --> 00:34:51,931
Scott: the problem was that this technique pretty much meant if you want to win this game you have to hurt your hands like going.

511
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:56,293
Rym: it's kind of like the old fishing game in the original Mario Party.

512
00:34:56,333 --> 00:35:01,441
Scott: who wants to play a game where it's pretty much win by shaking your hand back and forth and hurting your thumb?

513
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:04,212
Scott: that doesn't really make for a good game.

514
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,863
Scott: I mean and you can say no snaking.

515
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:07,870
Scott: but then it's like what the fuck?

516
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:08,614
Scott: so what how many?

517
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:09,319
Scott: what's the line?

518
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,934
Scott: how many boosts do I do before it's snaking you know?

519
00:35:11,974 --> 00:35:15,410
Rym: yeah I mean if it's a long corner am I only allowed to slide once?

520
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:16,937
Rym: what if I slide twice?

521
00:35:16,977 --> 00:35:18,103
Rym: what if I get hit with something?

522
00:35:18,143 --> 00:35:19,108
Rym: I got a slide again.

523
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:27,427
Scott: so I mean the thing is the DS version in all other respects is really awesome except for that one thing just sort of ruined it and it was really sad.

524
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:28,652
Rym: so Mario Kart Wii.

525
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,782
Rym: so far I have almost nothing bad to say about it.

526
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,689
Scott: yeah Mario Kart Wii right.

527
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,556
Scott: well people talk right.

528
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:38,217
Scott: first of all there's a few bad things that they got the battle mode in there.

529
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:39,163
Scott: the battle mode is stupid.

530
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:39,928
Scott: you should never play.

531
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:41,015
Rym: I haven't even played it yet.

532
00:35:41,317 --> 00:35:41,981
Scott: it's battle mode.

533
00:35:42,021 --> 00:35:42,484
Scott: it's lame.

534
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:43,771
Scott: it's by definition lame.

535
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:44,675
Scott: the game is about the racing.

536
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:48,236
Scott: also in the battle mode I've heard you can only do team play in it.

537
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:49,422
Scott: you can't do every man for himself.

538
00:35:50,224 --> 00:36:08,367
Scott: but yeah the actual single-player mode right is sort of annoying because you have to unlock all this shit to beat all these courses and everything to unlock all the carts and the characters and the extra courses and all the different cc's and all the bikes and all that stuff and that's just sort of annoying and time-consuming.

539
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:16,689
Scott: but it serves the purpose of allowing you to build your skills and by beating that single-player you have the skills to compete in the multiplayer which is like I guess okay.

540
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:22,536
Scott: in the single-player there's also this rubber band AI of you know and it is there.

541
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:23,059
Scott: it's like all.

542
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:29,293
Scott: there'll be blue shells and bullet bills and all sorts of other things that pretty much make you lose even when you're winning.

543
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:34,603
Scott: so it's like why should I even stay in first place if I fall behind I can easily catch up because I'll get an awesome item.

544
00:36:34,904 --> 00:36:39,164
Scott: if I pull too far ahead I'll be pulled back by other people getting awesome items.

545
00:36:39,345 --> 00:36:40,952
Rym: but who cares about the single-player?

546
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:41,514
Rym: right?

547
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:43,543
Scott: so the multiplayer.

548
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:45,873
Scott: you can turn off the bullshit items.

549
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:48,364
Rym: you can choose what set of items you want.

550
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,172
Scott: choose exact?

551
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:56,663
Rym: well no but they have the settings you can say like strategic and it pretty much only gives you mushrooms and green shells and occasionally a

552
00:36:56,843 --> 00:36:58,067
Scott: banana

553
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:06,602
Rym: peel a block a triple mushroom I think a red shell but not that frequently and it it's a lot more skill based and a lot more fun at least for us.

554
00:37:06,782 --> 00:37:12,644
Rym: yeah you can also which is equally fun in the right setting turn on crazy items.

555
00:37:12,704 --> 00:37:14,913
Rym: yeah everyone's getting bullet bills.

556
00:37:15,073 --> 00:37:23,095
Scott: in the normal mode right if you're in like last place you'll get more powerful items to get you catch up and if you're in first place you get weaker items to sort of.

557
00:37:23,418 --> 00:37:24,724
Scott: you know you can't really do much.

558
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:26,612
Scott: you'll just have to keep racing until you know.

559
00:37:27,717 --> 00:37:33,182
Scott: but in the aggressive items mode everyone gets the crazy items as if they were falling way behind.

560
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:35,815
Scott: so even if you're in the front you get blue shelled.

561
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:37,825
Scott: you probably have like a bullet bill.

562
00:37:38,227 --> 00:37:39,917
Scott: so it's like oh no you blue shelled me.

563
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,744
Scott: now I'm in second place bullet bill.

564
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,650
Scott: oh shit take that bitches.

565
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:47,423
Scott: yeah and they got a lot of tracks in there.

566
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:49,796
Scott: they don't have as many tracks as I would like.

567
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:53,294
Scott: I mean I think the GBA one sled more tracks but there's plenty.

568
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:54,902
Scott: there's enough to keep you interested.

569
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:56,369
Scott: they got the bikes.

570
00:37:56,731 --> 00:38:05,808
Scott: so the fact that the bikes are in there it's sort of like every track is actually two tracks because driving the bike is completely different from driving the cart.

571
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:15,743
Scott: so doing one track with the bike and one track with the car it's almost like there's two tracks going on and the fact that you can compete cart against bike is actually really sort of interesting.

572
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:21,494
Scott: but it also comes down to sort of I know that the bike is faster on this track and I know the carts faster on that track.

573
00:38:22,077 --> 00:38:26,923
Rym: of course there are ways around that by agreeing to do certain tracks or like bikes only carts only.

574
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:28,310
Rym: there's a lot of ways to handle that.

575
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:32,911
Rym: yeah but I mean overall playing actually playing the game is super fun.

576
00:38:33,253 --> 00:38:33,815
Scott: oh super fun.

577
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:36,026
Scott: and the thing the we've got to talk about the wheel all right.

578
00:38:36,408 --> 00:38:39,931
Scott: so it comes to the wheel and the wheel is just a piece of plastic you put on the Wiimote.

579
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:43,977
Scott: you can just drive with the Wiimote you know turning it back and forth like you didn't excite.

580
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:46,672
Rym: you can also use a GameCube controller you can use up.

581
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:48,059
Rym: you can use any controller.

582
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,855
Rym: pretty much you can use any available except the Wii Zapper.

583
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:57,849
Scott: you can't use the Wii Zapper now but you can use any available Wii control except the Wii Zapper and it's it works with all of them.

584
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:00,962
Scott: it's like every single driving mode works and works well.

585
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:14,000
Scott: the thing is with the Wii wheel with the you know the tilting it back and forth mode you're at a disadvantage because if there's like especially on the higher cc's you just cannot turn back and forth that quickly.

586
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:34,328
Scott: so if it's like right turn left turn you're not going to be able to like actually get good power slides on both the quick turns at high speeds with the Wii wheel because the response just isn't quick enough and you're not going to be able to take the turns super tight you know and you're not going to be able to like sneak in between two really close banana peels like you can with the nunchuck or a GameCube controller.

587
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:44,156
Rym: now I'm glad they included the wheel and I'm glad that they also let you use a normal control scheme because it feels real nice to use the wheel and for casual play it's really nice.

588
00:39:44,236 --> 00:39:45,724
Scott: but the wheels really fun.

589
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:51,533
Rym: but if you are if you're got one of those people who wants to be like super good at the game don't even bother with it.

590
00:39:51,574 --> 00:39:53,806
Rym: just go straight to the analog stick and ever look back.

591
00:39:53,846 --> 00:39:55,053
Scott: is the advantage of the wheel?

592
00:39:55,556 --> 00:40:00,057
Scott: when you use the wheel it puts a wheel logo next to your guy on the screen.

593
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:08,215
Scott: so everyone knows you're using the wheel and if you do really well with the wheel it becomes a golden wheel and that's sort of like a big insult.

594
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:10,746
Scott: it's like if you're using the wheel and you lose.

595
00:40:10,947 --> 00:40:12,675
Scott: you say I was using the wheel.

596
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:14,263
Scott: of course I was at a disadvantage.

597
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:15,369
Scott: it's why I lost like it's.

598
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:20,155
Scott: you know it doesn't feel so bad if you win with the wheel and other people aren't also using the wheel.

599
00:40:20,216 --> 00:40:21,966
Scott: it's like I beat you with the wheel.

600
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,345
Scott: that's like beating you in a race but I was wearing a ball and chain on my leg.

601
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:28,838
Rym: so using the wheel it's a common strategy.

602
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:31,476
Rym: I do this often because no one will ever play against me in advance.

603
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:45,292
Rym: for us I'll be like alright I'll give everyone else double money or something and we'll play and if I lose it's that anytime you want the kind of trash talk all like of the gods like it's like the carte blanche of trash talk.

604
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:48,305
Rym: put yourself at a disadvantage willingly.

605
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:53,526
Rym: you cannot be faulted for losing and everyone else is so screwed if you win.

606
00:40:53,546 --> 00:40:55,372
Scott: yeah so it.

607
00:40:55,513 --> 00:40:56,777
Scott: basically you know.

608
00:40:56,837 --> 00:41:00,232
Scott: the fact that the Wii wheel puts you at a disadvantage for actually winning.

609
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:09,114
Scott: they make up for it in that because they're losing doesn't feel bad if using the Wii wheel because you feel you're at a disadvantage anyway and winning is double awesome.

610
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:17,001
Scott: so you know I really don't mind using the Wii wheel even though I know if I use it I'm probably not gonna win if the other people are actually good at playing the game.

611
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:30,337
Rym: now I think I mean there's not much else to say but I think we should at least mention the fact that this game unlike many other game unlike every other game on the Wii didn't completely fuck up the multiplayer online.

612
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:35,110
Scott: well the online is bad but it's satisfactory.

613
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:36,213
Rym: it's playable.

614
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:37,797
Rym: it mainly is once.

615
00:41:38,118 --> 00:41:46,605
Rym: unlike Smash Brothers which really really was a mistake two people can play online from the same way together.

616
00:41:46,866 --> 00:41:55,722
Scott: yes so me and Rym can go online together on the same way and race against people on the Internet's and but we're both using the same way.

617
00:41:55,763 --> 00:42:02,834
Scott: whereas with Smash Brothers to do that we would have needed to wheeze in the same room to the way to go online.

618
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:11,251
Rym: so you go online and just book track voting and all that same kind of stuff but it'll find a game that's already going and kind of put you into it for the next race.

619
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:20,395
Rym: yep and then every time a race ends it depending how many people drop out during or after that race it takes other people who are looking for games and puts them in.

620
00:42:20,436 --> 00:42:25,901
Rym: so once you play one or two or three games you've got a group of people that you've been playing with.

621
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:33,459
Rym: you see their names they're there and eventually distills into only the people who actually want to play and aren't just gonna quit when they lose.

622
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,676
Scott: yeah and the thing is unlike the Mario Kart DS or people quit.

623
00:42:36,696 --> 00:42:39,188
Scott: I mean you have to quit and start a new one right?

624
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,736
Scott: this would you just kind of?

625
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:44,090
Scott: even if everyone quits just keep playing and the game.

626
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:47,485
Scott: the service will just put new people into your existing game.

627
00:42:47,846 --> 00:42:55,787
Scott: just keep playing and every race is gonna have people in it and even if they drop out you just finish the race and then there'll be more people who just do just joined.

628
00:42:56,148 --> 00:43:03,839
Scott: so this it sort of solves the problem of people leaving the race doesn't fuck everything up and it's actually fun.

629
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,549
Rym: I could see myself doing it periodically.

630
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:09,509
Rym: I could definitely see myself doing this with friend codes and formites.

631
00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:11,598
Scott: yeah they give you this we channel.

632
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:13,527
Scott: actually that I didn't Mario Kart channel.

633
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:26,412
Scott: I didn't install it yet but basically it puts the Mario Kart thing on the front of your you know we menu or ever and you can sort of get right into the multiplayer from there and you can see what's going on and and all sorts of good stuff.

634
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:30,317
Rym: we'll probably kind of geek bite that after we use it enough to figure out if it's good or not.

635
00:43:30,338 --> 00:43:32,937
Scott: yeah I didn't install yet just because the Wii menu is kind of full.

636
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:36,176
Scott: I gotta like uninstall some games and do some other stuff on there.

637
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:41,747
Rym: now they definitely cleaning cut down on the frame rate and some other things when you play online but that's good to be expected.

638
00:43:41,808 --> 00:43:42,331
Scott: well it's like they.

639
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:47,834
Scott: they cut the frame rate right so it's not as smooth but there's no lag as a result.

640
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:49,300
Scott: it's like we made the game.

641
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:57,887
Scott: it's like the cards go just as fast but the frame rate is slower so it feels jaggy but it's jagged Lee.

642
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:01,943
Scott: the jaggedness is even across the whole race so you're never getting those more.

643
00:44:01,964 --> 00:44:03,872
Scott: it's not like we is smooth.

644
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:05,580
Scott: oh it's completely stopped.

645
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:07,147
Scott: it's smooth it stopped.

646
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:12,132
Scott: it's just slightly jaggy the whole time but still playable and I guess that's if.

647
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,660
Scott: that's what they had to do technologically.

648
00:44:14,062 --> 00:44:20,331
Rym: that's what you got to do and I think in the end the easiest thing to say is simply that Mario Kart Wii is one of those.

649
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:23,367
Rym: if you own a Wii you'd better damn well own Mario Kart.

650
00:44:23,387 --> 00:44:26,985
Scott: you had better damn well be owning this game if you got the Wii action going on.

651
00:44:27,086 --> 00:44:35,705
Scott: I mean well this is it's this and Smash Brothers are pretty much the the Wii awesomeness that you if you those are there's two games you're gonna have for the Wii.

652
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:36,569
Scott: that's it.

653
00:44:36,951 --> 00:44:41,479
Scott: I mean even more so than like the Zelda game because you can get that any old time and it'll be the same forever.

654
00:44:41,499 --> 00:44:44,886
Scott: but this game right now it's hot you gotta strike while the iron top people.

655
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:53,490
Rym: this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
