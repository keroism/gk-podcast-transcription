00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:15,096
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:20,039
Rym: We answer the question somewhat what is information technology?

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,926
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:33,390
Rym: What a day I get on my train.

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,940
Rym: I had lost my hour, so it's dark again.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,637
Rym: But that's fine because now it's light out sun is out.

9
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:39,200
Scott: It's amazing.

10
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:46,244
Scott: Yeah I don't know if we should use all the things that happen today as the opening bit because let's never want to have opening bits For the rest of the day.

11
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:52,548
Rym: Let's just rush right through him cuz tomorrow is gonna be the all smash brothers Alright, so let's see I wake up.

12
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:53,492
Scott: I missed the train.

13
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:55,180
Rym: Wow I've owned by one minute.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,353
Scott: I pulled into the train station as the train was pulling out.

15
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:00,744
Scott: if I hadn't brought back the trash cans I would have made it.

16
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:01,830
Rym: You know I've now.

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,679
Rym: I've only once missed a train.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,900
Scott: Yeah, at least for work, so I just hung out at the train station listen to my iPod whatever.

19
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:12,732
Rym: Yeah, see I got on my train and on my laptop, and I was laying there.

20
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:16,528
Rym: There's this big fat guy Behind the seat.

21
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:18,280
Rym: I was gonna sit in like he was big enough.

22
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:23,860
Rym: I'm curious how he got in the door because he took up two whole seats like fully.

23
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:28,677
Rym: He might have taken the double doors he might have and uh alright bad guy.

24
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:36,098
Rym: No big deal There's a seat in front of him, so I'll just sit there and and then about 20 minutes in the train ride I hear a choking sound followed by.

25
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:42,688
Scott: That's just wonderful.

26
00:01:44,073 --> 00:01:45,022
Scott: All right, you can stop that.

27
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:49,926
Scott: now You're wasting time in the back got worse and worse and any like fun.

28
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:50,930
Scott: She's moved to another car.

29
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,454
Rym: Oh, I left.

30
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:52,158
Rym: I left the car.

31
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,608
Rym: okay, so did a bunch of other people.

32
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:59,725
Rym: yeah But I tell you what if I were a conductor I would have woken that guy up every time I walked by him on the way home.

33
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:00,750
Scott: the guy sitting next to me.

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,530
Scott: He wasn't a bad guy, but he smelled like fast-food grease something fierce.

35
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:10,110
Scott: I couldn't tell if he worked in a fast food, or if he just had just eaten it and gotten all over himself.

36
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,609
Rym: I could not tell the economy is definitely not bad enough to where McDonald's workers are commuting in.

37
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:15,994
Scott: no But I smelled man.

38
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,825
Scott: the economy could never be good enough.

39
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:26,507
Scott: then McDonald's commute in but Yeah, he smelled like fast food all the whole way, and it was kind of sickening.

40
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,929
Rym: well I think the economy either has to be really really good or really really bad for the fast-food workers to commute in.

41
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:32,956
Rym: there's no middle ground there.

42
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:42,269
Scott: I Guess yeah Cuz if it was really bad their meager Fast-food incomes would be enough to pay for a commute because the commute price would be so low and money be so valuable.

43
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:54,174
Rym: yeah At the same time if real estate is still so bad in the city which even when the city turns to shit real estate still Crazy there, or if the economy was so great then fast-food workers are making a bajillion dollars And they could afford to commute.

44
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:57,006
Rym: or we have Monaco or Monica could have.

45
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:58,110
Scott: Monica could have Monica.

46
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,417
Rym: I'll tell you what if we have Monaco.

47
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:00,563
Rym: if I'm not in New York.

48
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:01,106
Rym: I'm out of here.

49
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:01,769
Scott: That's true.

50
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:05,623
Scott: Anyway, oh, so what other crazy should have?

51
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,250
Scott: Smash Brothers came in the mail today.

52
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:16,986
Rym: Yeah, just kidding as much as we want to play We're gonna hold out at least until we finish.

53
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:20,290
Scott: yeah Yeah, you probably thought you were clever fooling everyone like that.

54
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:20,631
Scott: But they're.

55
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:24,370
Scott: they can all look at their iPods and see this podcast is plenty of time left.

56
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,716
Rym: You know most people don't.

57
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:28,570
Rym: I know how people listen to their iPods, and I know I listen to my iPod.

58
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:33,855
Rym: I just hit play on a playlist, and I'm just sitting there, and I'm just listening And I don't look.

59
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:34,959
Rym: I don't see my iPod.

60
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,269
Rym: my iPod is away and possibly locked.

61
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:44,669
Scott: See I actually when it is away and locked But if I hear the end of a podcast I get my iPod out and to switch it up.

62
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:48,014
Scott: and Usually a lot of podcast the ending shit I don't want to listen to.

63
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:49,059
Scott: so I'll get ready.

64
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,667
Rym: so but what about the stinger?

65
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:58,531
Scott: no But if a podcast ended like started sounded like it was ending prematurely I would take a look to see if it was a broken mp3 where they fuck yeah, but you

66
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:04,974
Rym: forget that there's that that moment that split second where they hear that music and they go ah Those bastards.

67
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:13,790
Scott: and then they hear me say just kidding before they could look and they go ah right also today at work Like my co-workers weren't there, so it was like there's only four tech workers.

68
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:17,447
Scott: So it was me and the boss and that was it and we're just kind of sitting there like yep.

69
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:23,695
Rym: A few people didn't handle the DST transition so well no Lot of.

70
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:40,089
Rym: I called a lot of customers and people to say hey You're gonna connect an hour from now I'm guessing like oh, yeah Oops yeah, also a lot of people just didn't seem to have enough sleep today and TP And it doesn't cut solve that.

71
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,335
Rym: NTP just sets the clock.

72
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:45,846
Rym: your computer had better handle the time zone.

73
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:47,150
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

74
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,403
Scott: You got to set Etsy local time.

75
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,055
Rym: Yeah Symbolic link yes you do.

76
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:56,490
Rym: and also what if you have some demons or systems that think in GMT which a lot of people do?

77
00:04:57,771 --> 00:05:00,166
Scott: You gotta have Etsy local time set to the right thing.

78
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:00,649
Scott: so it's a no.

79
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,610
Rym: No, what if everything is in GMT straight up where there is no daylight savings time?

80
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:09,830
Rym: You need to be aware of that and right around that in your software, which a lot of people don't anyway.

81
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:12,678
Rym: Everything should be in GMT.

82
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:15,129
Rym: computers shouldn't have to care what time it is, but I digress.

83
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:15,894
Scott: well That's the way.

84
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,889
Scott: every that all my computers are is that?

85
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,390
Scott: well I guess except for my desktop because it has to reboot to Windows and Windows is stupid as shit.

86
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,536
Scott: But all my Linux only computers.

87
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:34,778
Scott: the hardware clock is in GMT and the operating system knows what time zone I'm in and it interpolates for any clock Like logs and everything.

88
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,050
Rym: I like to have everything as possible in GMT.

89
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:39,736
Scott: Oh, yeah, definitely But no for any time.

90
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:51,821
Scott: the only time it should translate to a time zone is when someone has to look at the time in Say, you know the clock applet in the yeah only when a human needs to see the exactly Yeah, oh and the governor is in trouble.

91
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:58,200
Rym: Oh, yeah our man Spitzer You know It amazes me.

92
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:03,219
Rym: Just how Many people can be so corrupt in our government.

93
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:11,570
Scott: I mean, I mean the governor I lived in Connecticut governor corrupt Governor Roland was corrupt and he got went to jail, right?

94
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:15,483
Scott: Let's see in New Jersey He was gay.

95
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,410
Scott: So he resigned.

96
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:19,923
Scott: But it's it's still the governor got in trouble.

97
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:23,112
Scott: New York governor Prostitution.

98
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,877
Scott: and we should do a Thursday on prostitution.

99
00:06:24,938 --> 00:06:32,065
Scott: We should do a Thursday on governors that too, but governor in trouble I don't think a lot of you know, are you connecting states governor's in trouble?

100
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:33,110
Rym: I'm gonna put forth a statement.

101
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:36,910
Rym: I don't think a lot of our listeners in the US actually know what the governor's duties are.

102
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:38,476
Scott: I don't think they know either.

103
00:06:38,517 --> 00:06:40,606
Scott: and you know what I'm thinking about this.

104
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:41,108
Rym: I'm curious.

105
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:41,610
Rym: I'm curious.

106
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:43,114
Rym: Answer this in the forum.

107
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:47,070
Rym: How many of you who live in the United States without looking it up know who your governor is?

108
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,015
Rym: That's all I want to ask.

109
00:06:48,195 --> 00:06:48,356
Scott: Yeah.

110
00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:49,040
Scott: Here's the thing.

111
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,050
Scott: I really want to know as I was trying to think right?

112
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,838
Scott: We have listeners that are international right and international listeners probably know about the president of the United States and whatever They may even know about the Congress.

113
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:09,810
Scott: They might know states have governors But like, you know, like Germany has states right and there must be local, you know Governance for the the states of Germany or the states of France.

114
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:17,494
Rym: If you're asking the providences of Canada, if you're asking people to tell us about their local or federalized government structure There's something called Wikipedia.

115
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:18,015
Scott: No, no, no.

116
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,280
Scott: No, I'm wondering right.

117
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,942
Scott: It's like I have.

118
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:23,632
Scott: I could not name a single like Like.

119
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,103
Scott: who's the the person in charge of Alberta?

120
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:27,510
Scott: I couldn't I have no clue.

121
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:29,320
Scott: The person in charge of Ontario.

122
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,915
Rym: No, I think it's obvious Scott You really don't know the person in charge of Alberta You're?

123
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,891
Rym: you honestly don't What?

124
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:41,124
Scott: there's someone who's like the who's the guess the equivalent of governor of?

125
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:42,829
Rym: obviously it's Prince Albert.

126
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,901
Scott: No It's not funny.

127
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:45,750
Scott: This is stupid.

128
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:46,636
Rym: No, it's not.

129
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:49,773
Scott: but you know They probably don't.

130
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:59,210
Scott: Albert and people in other countries probably have no fucking clue unless they're really smart or they pay really close attention About like the you know, the lower levels of the state and town.

131
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,217
Scott: Honest no, but I think it's really interesting.

132
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:10,266
Scott: and now I kind of want to know how local and state governments who work in other countries Yeah, and I want them to know about ours Wikipedia.

133
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:13,354
Scott: Yeah Won't be that complete.

134
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:14,799
Scott: Wikipedia is u.s.

135
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,050
Rym: Central more so go read the Wikipedia on Germany.

136
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,903
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but to get the to get the really detailed information.

137
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,990
Scott: I'd have to read the Wikipedia that's written in German.

138
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,824
Scott: Really there'd be a lot more information in that one than there would be.

139
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:38,090
Rym: I suggest you go because most Wikipedia is for countries that people care enough about to write an article about Tend to have an entirely separate page dedicated solely to the minutiae of their governmental structures.

140
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,150
Rym: Yeah, I'm just saying I think all the information is there.

141
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:44,230
Scott: I think that in that level of information will be there.

142
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:50,130
Scott: But if I were to say look up Information about like a specific state in a specific town and like what's the situation is there right now?

143
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:53,010
Rym: I think that would be worse now because that shouldn't even be in Wikipedia.

144
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:55,410
Scott: Well, a lot of this stuff's in there for the US and Wikipedia.

145
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,624
Scott: They're like not really pages for like every town in the United States and who's the mayor?

146
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:04,943
Rym: and you realize there's pages for most of The places in France and Britain to to go.

147
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:05,485
Scott: take a look then.

148
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:06,167
Scott: that'd be interesting.

149
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:14,590
Rym: Anyway But yeah, there's there's a bunch of news and I'll talk about this real briefly because I so little needs to be said.

150
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:33,637
Rym: but apparently a Lawmaker Tim couch in a state somewhere some state that doesn't matter at all has Decided that the best way to fix the problems that he is facing In the world today and the people are facing is to ban Anonymity on the internet.

151
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,229
Rym: and all I want to say is good luck, sir with that.

152
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:39,588
Rym: Good luck to you, sir.

153
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:56,678
Rym: Yeah, I don't know where to begin on that one like I it's very rare that statement by a person Will is able to so succinctly and so clearly convey unto me the fact that they have no Concept of what the internet is.

154
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:59,190
Scott: you should probably ban steering wheels on cars.

155
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:00,720
Scott: No steering wheels on the car.

156
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,410
Rym: never use the computer in their lives.

157
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:06,363
Scott: We should we should ban we should ban wings on airplanes.

158
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,250
Scott: The wings are causing all the trouble there.

159
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:14,170
Rym: Of course, he says enforcing this bill if it becomes law would be a challenge.

160
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:18,886
Scott: Well, okay, so he's not a hundred percent moron he's just 99.9 percent moron.

161
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:22,254
Rym: This is just like.

162
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:23,098
Rym: this is crazy.

163
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:25,750
Rym: quote if the bill becomes law the website operator.

164
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,970
Rym: So I guess this only affects website operators in Kentucky.

165
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:34,190
Rym: Okay Would have to pay if someone was allowed to post information anonymously on their site.

166
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:39,590
Rym: The fine would be five hundred dollars for a first offense and one thousand dollars for each offense after that.

167
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,753
Scott: So basically all that.

168
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:41,455
Scott: why doesn't he?

169
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:46,810
Scott: that's the same thing as writing a law saying we don't want anyone to host websites in Kentucky.

170
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:48,575
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

171
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:51,250
Rym: but it's also illegal to post anything online.

172
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,887
Rym: So if you live in Kentucky and you post on slash dot you're breaking the law.

173
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:56,530
Scott: Wait a minute.

174
00:10:57,373 --> 00:11:01,070
Scott: But if you're anonymous and you're in Kentucky, how the fuck will they know?

175
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,530
Rym: Well, they'll probably try to subpoena slashed out for IP addresses.

176
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,358
Scott: So wait, they're gonna subpoena slash time.

177
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:11,690
Scott: say give us the IP addresses of every anonymous poster And we're gonna look and see if any of them are in Kentucky.

178
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:14,142
Scott: Well, no, that's not gonna fly.

179
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:15,330
Rym: what they'd be tricky.

180
00:11:15,611 --> 00:11:25,627
Rym: What they probably do is just ban any sort of business interactions with slash dot Which is fine because I don't think there's any company in Kentucky that would bother advertising on slash dot.

181
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:26,330
Scott: man.

182
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,310
Scott: I hope they do this because it'd be so cool to drive through Kentucky in the future.

183
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:34,441
Scott: It'd be like Jetson's house Jetson's house caveman log cabin.

184
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:35,685
Scott: caveman log cabin.

185
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:36,326
Scott: Jetson's house.

186
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,670
Scott: when you come back out on the other side.

187
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,980
Rym: This is so ludicrous that it's not even worth discussing.

188
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:45,369
Rym: Banning anonymity on the internet is like banning spitting in a dark room.

189
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,976
Rym: Okay, anyway, so what do you got?

190
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:52,626
Scott: so, you know, I hate the fake medicines a lot.

191
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:53,790
Scott: you hate the fake medicines.

192
00:11:54,332 --> 00:12:09,322
Rym: Yeah, the only difference between the two of us is that Scott will not shop at the local Hippie market because while the local hippie market is the only store in the area that has a lot of really good stuff It also sells made-up fake dangerous medicine pretty much.

193
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,024
Scott: Well, it's not.

194
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,348
Scott: it's the opposite of dangerous.

195
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,352
Scott: It does nothing That's.

196
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:14,606
Rym: that's a problem from other perspectives.

197
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:15,129
Scott: Yeah, it is.

198
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:23,470
Rym: But the only difference is that I will go there But I will get into arguments with people and generally be a cock while I'm there and I'll feel dirty the whole time.

199
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,990
Rym: But it's the only place I can buy my guava juice.

200
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:28,943
Scott: You can buy guava juice across the river at the other place.

201
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:30,530
Rym: Yes across the river.

202
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,343
Scott: Can you buy guava juice in the city and then carry it home?

203
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,046
Scott: Yeah, why not?

204
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:36,250
Scott: I carry stuff to the city.

205
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,175
Scott: I might as well carry it home.

206
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:38,522
Rym: That's not worth it.

207
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:42,077
Rym: Anyway, so You know how I get away with it.

208
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,292
Rym: I buy small amounts with my credit card Something I hate.

209
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:46,633
Scott: worse.

210
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:47,576
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

211
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:55,685
Scott: hate equally to fake medicine is when people are putting down real medicine Like those people who say don't take vaccines, they'll give you autism.

212
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:56,710
Scott: All right complete bullshit.

213
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:59,084
Rym: I think we can sum this up real quick in case anyone.

214
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:06,762
Rym: we have a lot of new listeners So in case you're not up to speed One the Marisol isn't even used in fucking vaccines anymore in the u.s.

215
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:09,790
Rym: So it doesn't even matter - it doesn't cause autism.

216
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:14,119
Rym: three Vaccines in general do not cause autism period.

217
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:21,555
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you don't notice right, I mean I had a biology teacher once in 11th grade and he was like Oh, you don't need vaccines.

218
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:22,238
Scott: It'd be alright.

219
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,770
Rym: Right and wow that guy shouldn't be a biology teacher.

220
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:33,610
Scott: Yeah, and at the time it kind of made a little bit of sense, you know Cuz from what I learned in biology class, you know, like, you know, if a virus comes in your body will make antibodies.

221
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,575
Scott: You know, whatever right?

222
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:46,610
Scott: He was like, oh you don't need to take a flu vaccine Just take some you know Nearly dead flu and just kind of swab them on the back of your throat and then your body will build up vaccine exactly What.

223
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,840
Scott: So and it was only you know a couple years later that I realized huh?

224
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:52,362
Scott: Okay.

225
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:56,093
Scott: Anyway, so yeah if you don't notice Right.

226
00:13:56,113 --> 00:14:05,910
Scott: Oh and also the other argument that biology teacher used to make was you know Oh back in my day when the polio vaccine was coming out kids would get the vaccine and then they would still get polio.

227
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:13,589
Rym: but So anyway, I have a hyphenated word to respond to that that is herd immunity, right.

228
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:26,995
Scott: so If you don't realize right, um way back before the polio vaccine There was a lot of polio and now after the polio vaccine Where's the polio?

229
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:27,577
Scott: I don't know.

230
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:31,910
Scott: maybe we should look for it, you know before MMR kids used to get measles.

231
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:32,452
Scott: You know what.

232
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:33,756
Scott: and mumps and rubella.

233
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:37,810
Rym: I'll tell you this measles sucks mumps sucks rubella not cool.

234
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:38,813
Scott: But you know what?

235
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:39,235
Scott: now?

236
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:40,719
Scott: who gets measles?

237
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:41,943
Scott: who gets mumps?

238
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:42,927
Scott: who gets rubella?

239
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:47,822
Scott: at least the United States Almost nobody, you know what you would get it like.

240
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:50,030
Scott: you would get the flu or the cold all the fucking time.

241
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,715
Scott: But now no, it's gone.

242
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:52,739
Rym: tetanus shots.

243
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:53,802
Rym: What about diptheria?

244
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:56,330
Rym: diptheria is actually really dangerous to a lot of kids.

245
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,667
Rym: But now you don't get to theory because you get your tetanus diptheria shot.

246
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:00,772
Scott: That's right But you know what?

247
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:05,830
Scott: now for anyone who doesn't believe in fucking vaccines and their awesomeness, right?

248
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,534
Rym: I'm sure we don't need.

249
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:08,305
Rym: I mean, I guess we're preaching to the choir now.

250
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:13,123
Scott: Yes Because anyone who disagrees right stop listening cuz they're more.

251
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,790
Rym: I don't want those people listening to my show.

252
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:19,670
Scott: Yeah, if you don't believe something like that that's in the past that you know, maybe it was something else.

253
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,941
Scott: You don't know cuz you're a moron.

254
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:23,519
Scott: Here's an Inarguable proof.

255
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,008
Scott: the vaccines are the real deal.

256
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:31,447
Scott: Uganda right people were kids were getting meningitis left and right.

257
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:36,063
Scott: like 5,000 kids a year would die from this horrible meningitis.

258
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,790
Scott: and if you don't know about meningitis Meningitis is like the worst thing ever.

259
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,050
Rym: There are two forms of meningitis effectively in terms of how they like what they can do to you.

260
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,138
Rym: There's viral meningitis.

261
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,790
Scott: I really quick and die even quicker.

262
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:52,547
Rym: Well, actually the viral meningitis and bacterial meningitis and actually my stepdad had viral meningitis.

263
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:56,830
Rym: Uh, it's not At that bad, it's pretty bad.

264
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,499
Rym: Most forms of bacterial cuz remember it's an infection of the meninges.

265
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:04,736
Rym: if you don't know what meninges are I suggest get the learn To John Wikipedia.

266
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:07,866
Rym: if you if there's bacteria growing in your meninges.

267
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,400
Scott: you're serious shit You're going to die.

268
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,690
Scott: You need those meninges.

269
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:20,830
Scott: but anyway, I Think the things that are in anyway or anyway, so there was mad mad meningitis going down in Uganda, right?

270
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,857
Scott: So they got this vaccine.

271
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:24,424
Scott: this vaccine has existed since 1991, right?

272
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:29,188
Scott: But it cost seven dollars at the price.

273
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:35,106
Scott: to you know The poor country price was seven dollars which is seven times as much as some other vaccines that they could get.

274
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:39,682
Scott: so they You know through their magic works the kind of works that Bill Clinton are doing.

275
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:40,846
Scott: people like Bill Clinton are doing.

276
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:49,098
Scott: they got the price down to one dollar and they helped prevent 2.3 million deaths since the year 2000.

277
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:53,390
Rym: That's uh, that's closing in on Norman Norman Borlaug right there.

278
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,836
Scott: I know what Uganda.

279
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:57,765
Scott: people dying of meningitis insert vaccine.

280
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,819
Scott: No more Meningitis, huh?

281
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,626
Scott: No, does it maybe work?

282
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:04,670
Rym: now to the crazy?

283
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,493
Rym: Who argue that?

284
00:17:06,554 --> 00:17:10,890
Rym: Yeah, it protects you from those diseases, but it also causes autism.

285
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:16,506
Rym: I would wager that autism rates in Uganda are not gonna change.

286
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:16,887
Scott: No.

287
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:30,689
Rym: No, I don't think so except perhaps that maybe a percentage of children who might have died of meningitis before they had the chance to even Manifest their autism will now manifest their autism, but that's not.

288
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:32,815
Scott: Anyway, so here's the thing, right?

289
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:34,620
Scott: I'm sure that in Uganda.

290
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:38,895
Scott: They had plenty of witch doctoring maybe homeopathies maybe Acupuncture's.

291
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:40,987
Scott: who knows they probably had some bullshit medicine.

292
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:41,469
Scott: You know what?

293
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:43,034
Scott: They had that.

294
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:45,688
Scott: they've had that because that's the argument people always make right.

295
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:48,802
Scott: this Acupuncture has been around for millions of years.

296
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:49,264
Scott: Therefore.

297
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,470
Scott: It's so old and ancient.

298
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,270
Scott: It must be right because anything old is right something new is wrong.

299
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:59,781
Rym: speaking of which acupuncture reflex ology and Chiropractic are bullshit and homeopathy.

300
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:01,469
Rym: Yes, but I'm assuming you know that.

301
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:01,670
Rym: yeah.

302
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:12,490
Scott: Anyway in Uganda, they've had some sort of fake medicine probably for a very long time And you know what the meningitis didn't stop until the real medicine came.

303
00:18:14,332 --> 00:18:18,026
Scott: Real medicine is real fake medicine is fake.

304
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:18,930
Scott: shut the fuck.

305
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:26,270
Rym: The Problem is I don't think anyone who needs to hear that message is listening to GeekNights let alone on the internet.

306
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:27,815
Scott: No, I don't think so.

307
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,568
Scott: But even if one person has learned it'll be enough.

308
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,606
Rym: so Right along with that since my news was such a cop-out.

309
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:38,869
Rym: I just I couldn't Ignore this to get to the Facebook news or what?

310
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,956
Rym: I got a news here that it's kind of interesting.

311
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:44,447
Rym: actually now the article to which this links includes a video.

312
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:47,204
Rym: do not Okay, watch this video.

313
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:49,653
Rym: the video is absolutely Stupid.

314
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:50,698
Scott: I didn't watch the video.

315
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:52,770
Scott: I just read the article which is disappointingly short.

316
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,884
Rym: Yes, the articles dumb the videos dumb, but it's one of those.

317
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:57,310
Rym: the article doesn't matter.

318
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,579
Rym: What matters is the discussion that is generated?

319
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,989
Scott: I think you'll make a good Thursday episode and we should hang on to it.

320
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:03,879
Rym: Oh, maybe we will but I'll introduce it.

321
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,066
Rym: then I'll do two half news's.

322
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:05,750
Rym: I think that works.

323
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:11,210
Rym: So the question raised is should scientists date people who believe in astrology?

324
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,805
Scott: The short answer right?

325
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,650
Scott: No Here's my short answer, right?

326
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,781
Scott: Every individual human being can date whoever the fuck they want.

327
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:22,627
Scott: And here's my other answer.

328
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:23,610
Scott: I wouldn't.

329
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:32,001
Rym: Well, you see it's actually I don't know how complicated of an issue it is because the way I look at it I mean you I mean there's arguments for I'll read the rest of this here.

330
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:36,850
Rym: wired science asks should Scientists date people who believe in astrology?

331
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,508
Rym: Apparently the argument is quite complex.

332
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:44,282
Rym: Astrology is a complex flawed mental shortcut for understanding the world.

333
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:45,345
Rym: That's an understatement.

334
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:46,428
Scott: It's quite an understatement.

335
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:50,280
Rym: So is Disregarding someone because of their spiritual beliefs.

336
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:51,864
Rym: That's that does not follow.

337
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:55,457
Rym: That's not quite a anyway false premise.

338
00:19:55,477 --> 00:20:09,170
Rym: possibly anyway, women are inundated with astrological nonsense from fashion magazines So so it is normative for them to believe it even if they otherwise are highly logical.

339
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:09,793
Rym: That's excellent.

340
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:13,030
Rym: that that's that takes sexism to a new level that I don't know.

341
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,350
Scott: I think that's about on the same level.

342
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,353
Scott: I've seen it everywhere else.

343
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:18,842
Rym: and the last thing smart people can convince themselves of silly things.

344
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:49,790
Rym: now, there is an interesting phenomenon whereby Certain sometimes people who are very smart will defend a wrong idea long after they would have in a vacuum already been convinced that the idea was wrong because of misplaced pride and because a lot of times smart people are able to find evidence and Put forth their arguments eloquently in order to kind of hold out longer like you might be wrong But you might be smart enough to convince people who are dumber than you that you're right anyway longer until someone smart such a right.

345
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:56,173
Scott: There's also the problem of this is where we're gonna start doing the whole episode on it and that there are people who are very Intelligent.

346
00:20:56,193 --> 00:21:22,894
Scott: they're very knowledgeable about the world and they're very good at you know Math and or other things right or writing or whatever and they're very intelligent smart people, but they don't have the the skeptical Scientific evidence is required or I will believe nothing viewpoint of the world Which is the only correct sort of viewpoint to have to be completely rational and thus they can convince themselves Of irrational things.

347
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:27,689
Rym: now, I mean that I take issue with almost every sentence in this little summary here.

348
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:32,379
Rym: I mean Astrology is a flawed mental shortcut for understanding the world.

349
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:36,050
Rym: astrology saying it's a flawed mental shortcut goes a step.

350
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,818
Rym: Yeah, it's just outright sham.

351
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,500
Rym: It's nothing.

352
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,423
Rym: It was anything.

353
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:42,569
Rym: It's just astrology is fantasy.

354
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:42,849
Scott: That's it.

355
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,658
Scott: It's that's just all there is to it.

356
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:45,905
Scott: It's completely made up nothing.

357
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:46,910
Rym: and the whole women thing.

358
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,588
Rym: I don't even want to touch that because that's just.

359
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:54,027
Scott: Yeah, I hope I clicked on the link because the link was just like should scientists date an astrologer?

360
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:55,680
Scott: and I was like Oh, that's not a bad.

361
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:56,530
Scott: I you know article.

362
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,868
Scott: I'll read that but the article is so bad and disappointing.

363
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:04,229
Rym: in short I was like, ah, but the whole but so is disregarding someone because of their spiritual beliefs.

364
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:17,550
Rym: now there's a real issue here with conflating ideas and spirituality and philosophy and religion are three very different things and people

365
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:25,729
Scott: You know have different definitions of them and such and you sort of have to before you discuss them with someone Decide what the definitions are going to do something.

366
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:32,887
Rym: There are a lot of people who are very spiritual but at the same time do not hold any irrational beliefs at all.

367
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:46,289
Rym: and there are a lot of people who when confronted with an atheist or someone who believes in science will Make an argument along the lines of oh you say there's no and nothing out there There can't be anything out there.

368
00:22:46,611 --> 00:22:51,529
Rym: But this on earth for what we've seen that nothing could possibly exist because that it added up.

369
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:54,217
Rym: But that's just because they're conflating the terms.

370
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,770
Rym: just because I haven't observed something doesn't mean it's not out there or something like that.

371
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:05,399
Rym: It just means I haven't observed it there and no one I've ever met or ever read of or ever Experienced has ever observed it.

372
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,587
Rym: There's no record of observing it.

373
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:13,630
Rym: Logically, I cannot believe that it exists and I can logically assume that it probably does not exist.

374
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,830
Rym: But that does not discount outright that it does not exist.

375
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:21,090
Rym: But a rational person will assume that it does not exist unless presented with other evidence.

376
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:23,144
Scott: Yes, this is why we should do a whole episode on this.

377
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:29,305
Rym: I think we should you know Yeah, just kind of the idea that denouncing religion in and of itself is not denouncing philosophy.

378
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,990
Rym: I think it is spirituality.

379
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:42,580
Scott: I think basically it goes back to our old point of you know While discriminating against anyone seems wrong and in many cases is wrong But it depends on why you discriminate against the person.

380
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,789
Scott: if I discriminate against someone because they're a psycho killer That's okay.

381
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:51,890
Scott: If I discriminated against someone because they believe the tooth fairy is real that's okay.

382
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:56,264
Rym: If I discriminate against someone because they're black whoa now that trouble.

383
00:23:56,525 --> 00:24:00,701
Rym: Yeah, that's not okay You know, but I mean it's kind of like.

384
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:08,629
Scott: I mean if I discriminate against someone Who's a Jew because they were born of Jewish parents and they have a Jewish culture That's not okay.

385
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:16,262
Scott: If I discriminated against someone because they believe in a magical Skyman and they treat their wife poorly that is okay.

386
00:24:16,543 --> 00:24:21,210
Scott: those, you know, the thing is they both, you know You could put you on both of those things, but they're two different.

387
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:23,698
Scott: This is where you run into trouble.

388
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:26,670
Rym: you say we need a word for secular Jew as opposed to religious.

389
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:34,642
Scott: We need we need a word in general for secular kinds of thing, you know Yeah, like a Muslim religious Muslim cultural Muslim big difference.

390
00:24:34,903 --> 00:24:41,646
Scott: Yeah, I mean, yeah, there are people who are just Irish You know, they just love Ireland and they like to drink and they like leprechauns.

391
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:49,594
Scott: Wow way to go Yeah, I know right and I'm throwing to my little funniness there, but they're not like super Catholics like You know could be off.

392
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:53,930
Scott: most Irish type peoples are because it's also the Protestant Irish and that is why they have wars and things.

393
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,642
Scott: But not getting into that because I don't know enough about it.

394
00:24:56,682 --> 00:24:58,610
Rym: to say more I could speak volumes.

395
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:01,996
Scott: I just get into trouble for For many reasons.

396
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:05,267
Rym: It was actually a hot issue in Detroit and I'm well versed in the.

397
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:07,777
Scott: the Irish trouble I'm only slightly versed.

398
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:10,610
Scott: So let us pass that on and continue to things of the day.

399
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,124
Rym: Well, I'll end on this because this is this is the important thing.

400
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:14,130
Rym: I want to get out of this here.

401
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:26,405
Rym: When it comes to disregard it people seem to try to make spiritual or religious beliefs somehow different from other kinds of beliefs or other kinds of assertions and I can't go there.

402
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:59,910
Rym: I'm of the mind that Any idea once an idea is put forth into the world into the marketplace of ideas If someone states an idea that idea is now no matter who said it no matter what backing it has subject to the scrutiny of the world and subject to all the verbal or written criticism that any human being can muster and If someone is not willing to deal with that sort of criticism or that sort of critique Then they really shouldn't be putting forth the idea and then getting in a huff when people Possibly disrespect or shoot down or otherwise criticize the idea.

403
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,917
Scott: Yep, all ideas are created equal.

404
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:05,370
Scott: if your idea can't stand up on its own then it can't stand up.

405
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:07,117
Scott: Idea is sacred.

406
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:09,486
Rym: but to get to the I'm done now, this is it.

407
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,470
Rym: This is the easy way.

408
00:26:10,932 --> 00:26:12,499
Rym: It's real easy to get into the whole.

409
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,207
Rym: Well, what about philosophical?

410
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:14,890
Rym: What about blah?

411
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:20,025
Rym: It's very very very simple to answer this question.

412
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:27,910
Rym: if you get into these specific Questions instead of the general questions would I ever date or even associate with someone who actually believed in astrology?

413
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,880
Rym: No, hell no, I wouldn't even respect you exactly.

414
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:33,806
Rym: astrology is BS if you believe in it.

415
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:34,769
Rym: I hate you.

416
00:26:36,873 --> 00:26:46,472
Scott: We're gonna get nasty lettuce and astrology listeners anyway.

417
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,455
Rym: things of the day This.

418
00:26:49,937 --> 00:26:51,906
Rym: I'd really like to talk about this as a whole show.

419
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:54,736
Scott: It's almost I love The whole shows isn't it?

420
00:26:54,997 --> 00:27:02,122
Rym: But I'll just briefly in case anyone missed this on slashdot I want to direct your attention to the Cuban memory stick underground.

421
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:03,988
Rym: very simply the idea here.

422
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:06,641
Rym: Is that Cuba kind of repressed?

423
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:25,430
Rym: difficult to get information Censorship abroad, you know, a lot of people try to make Cuba out to be this socialist paradise and Regardless of the reasons for Cuba being the way it is because they're largely the United States fault It remains that Cuba is not a very nice place to live and Cuba has serious problems.

424
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:29,503
Scott: Then the only the nicest thing about Cuba is the weather pretty much.

425
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:34,507
Rym: Yeah, and the health system is okay But don't pretend it's this wonderful like.

426
00:27:34,628 --> 00:27:39,510
Scott: anyway He was actually a lot nicer for tourists than it is for people living there.

427
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,832
Scott: And the problem is tourists come there and it's kind of nice But they don't realize.

428
00:27:42,852 --> 00:27:53,970
Rym: a lot of the things tourists get are like, you know, not allowed for normal citizens Yep, but anyway, so the Cuban memory stick underground refers to the fact that there is now a trade.

429
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:55,114
Rym: This is like sneaker.

430
00:27:55,134 --> 00:28:02,900
Rym: net times a million in USB sticks filled with websites Information and pretty much anything they can get from the outside world.

431
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:04,846
Rym: people smuggle them in and ship them in.

432
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:10,642
Rym: they copy them and pass them around and This is utterly utterly fascinating to me.

433
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:11,646
Rym: That's so awesome.

434
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:18,548
Scott: They can't get the internet So someone copies a bunch of websites on to like flash memories takes and then they share them all.

435
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:19,190
Scott: that's so cool.

436
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:20,294
Rym: It gives me an idea.

437
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:21,438
Scott: what computers are they using?

438
00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:23,365
Scott: because no one's sending them computers, right?

439
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:24,610
Rym: You can get a hold of computers.

440
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:26,588
Scott: Yeah, they got like computers with USB.

441
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,318
Scott: I mean, yeah, how long is it?

442
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,645
Scott: but the embargoes been going on?

443
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:30,510
Scott: how long how you know?

444
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,857
Scott: What kind of things get smuggled in?

445
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:33,990
Rym: and there are nations that are not embargo in Cuba?

446
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:35,003
Scott: No, I guess.

447
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:40,070
Rym: but yeah The thing is it's easier to get crappy old computers than it is to get internet access.

448
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:41,550
Rym: I want to is to get around the sensor.

449
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:43,661
Scott: I want to know what the gaming scene is.

450
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,270
Scott: the video gaming scene is liking cute.

451
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,741
Rym: I'll bet there's a lot of old.

452
00:28:46,782 --> 00:28:47,830
Rym: Sega Genesis is down.

453
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:54,858
Scott: I bet there's something going on there and I want in on that action because it's probably people who are like Rockin a Street Fighter 2 machine somewhere in Cuba.

454
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:55,922
Rym: It's gives me an idea.

455
00:28:55,982 --> 00:29:08,657
Rym: I'd kind of like to set up some sort of charitable gray market charity organization where we basically put information on memory sticks and Airdrop them in places like Afghanistan and China.

456
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:10,321
Scott: Oh, we do better with hard drives.

457
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:21,934
Scott: I think make no yes hard drives coming from the sky A little tight, you know those little parachutes at the army man, you'd buy them in like the 25 cent, you know machine They come a little bubble.

458
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:25,470
Scott: Yes, we could just tie the USB stick to that with a little parachute.

459
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,020
Rym: I used to put those on model rockets.

460
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:28,349
Rym: I never saw those army men again.

461
00:29:28,913 --> 00:29:33,881
Scott: I used to just throw them off like out of my window or whatever and anyway I think they would be stuck in a bush and I'd get them out.

462
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:35,188
Scott: and they don't be one-time use.

463
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,896
Rym: now You got to wrap that thing.

464
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:38,242
Scott: Anyway, yeah, it's a pain.

465
00:29:38,282 --> 00:29:38,744
Rym: What do you got?

466
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:40,975
Scott: Oh Right things a day.

467
00:29:41,377 --> 00:29:43,587
Scott: So when I was a kid, I played Legos.

468
00:29:43,627 --> 00:29:44,190
Scott: you play Legos.

469
00:29:45,411 --> 00:29:46,810
Rym: Legos were like the best thing ever.

470
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,130
Rym: In fact, the only reason I'm still doing gig nights is because my mom has never shipped me all my Legos.

471
00:29:52,431 --> 00:30:01,684
Scott: Anyway, so when I was a kid, I thought I was so cool in the days before the internet You know I wrote a letter to Lego because I was mostly playing with my castle Legos.

472
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:04,014
Scott: cuz I like the castles which is still the best Legos, right?

473
00:30:04,155 --> 00:30:06,509
Scott: I had my Robin Hood's and I had the black Knights and they go haha.

474
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:13,690
Scott: Anyway, I went I was playing my Legos and I said, you know, what would be cool if they had like race car Legos?

475
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,169
Scott: And of course they didn't have race car Legos.

476
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:24,526
Scott: But I was stupid and I was a little punk kid like elementary school and I said, you know, let's be cool They'd army man Legos, which they did not have and they still do not have army man Legos.

477
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:25,630
Rym: that kind of makes sense.

478
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:31,770
Rym: Yeah, because they don't like the violence and such right unless the violence is directed at pirates or spacemen.

479
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:32,142
Rym: Yeah.

480
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,690
Scott: So I wrote a letter to Lego and I was like you should make race car Legos and army man Legos.

481
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:42,841
Scott: And they just sent me back and they were like, thanks for your ideas But we can't use your ideas blah.

482
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:43,646
Scott: and that was like.

483
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:49,626
Scott: as a punk kid I was like, yeah, fuck you and There still are no army man Legos and there always were race car Legos.

484
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,458
Scott: like one of the first Lego I was dumb plus.

485
00:30:51,498 --> 00:30:58,949
Rym: I mean no violence in Legos I'm sure all of you out there whenever you needed to deal with dissidents you made the gallows out of that whip.

486
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:00,434
Scott: Yeah, I know right.

487
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:02,702
Scott: Anyway, this is a website.

488
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:08,218
Scott: brick arms calm and you know what they sell Illegal arms for Lego man.

489
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,750
Scott: pretty much it is like the black market of Lego pieces.

490
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:14,489
Scott: They got like you can make terrorists.

491
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:18,421
Scott: They got like every all different kinds of guns like.

492
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:20,246
Scott: they got mp5s.

493
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,569
Scott: They got TMPs.

494
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,636
Scott: They got p90s.

495
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:24,660
Scott: They got FAMAS.

496
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,847
Scott: They got you know sniper rifles.

497
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:27,590
Scott: They got grenades.

498
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:32,050
Scott: They got like bunches of grenades that you can like bunch up on the front of a Lego guy.

499
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:35,905
Scott: They got like scary German Nazi soldiers with dogs.

500
00:31:35,945 --> 00:31:37,030
Rym: Do they have bandoliers?

501
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,030
Scott: I don't know if they have bit those guys with band.

502
00:31:40,171 --> 00:31:40,614
Scott: Yeah, they have.

503
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:42,990
Scott: the guys have bandoliers like painted on their body.

504
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:47,469
Rym: I want like a bandolier much like that arrow sheet that I can put on a Lego man.

505
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:53,990
Scott: But if you're looking for like some military Lego action brick arms calm as like the full loadout.

506
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,124
Scott: Let me let me read some of these to you brick arms bandit.

507
00:31:57,405 --> 00:31:59,954
Scott: He looks like a terrorist Colonel marine.

508
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:03,022
Scott: Oh, it's some girl who's like a marine spy bio.

509
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:03,744
Scott: James Bond.

510
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:04,887
Scott: World War two.

511
00:32:04,947 --> 00:32:05,689
Scott: German SS.

512
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:07,234
Scott: major World War two.

513
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:08,158
Scott: German colonel.

514
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,403
Scott: World War two.

515
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:11,150
Scott: German soldier panzer green.

516
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:18,708
Scott: There's a lot of Legos going on here and if you like the militaries This is a. this is where your Legos are at and you could buy it up.

517
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:22,570
Scott: And I think they have a deal like where every time you buy something you get a free gun.

518
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:38,695
Scott: It would hurt RPGs not bad Do they shoot know that of course just plastic RPGs that a Lego guy can hold in his hand and they come in dark blue gray medium gray silver metallic and I see some gold in there but Metallic not bad.

519
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:41,948
Scott: Yeah, but there's also I think that might be some miss painted ones that look gold.

520
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:42,470
Scott: Who knows?

521
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:50,150
Rym: So anyway, this won't be super long because a lot of the topics I have to bring up in this series are very very detailed.

522
00:32:50,613 --> 00:32:53,510
Rym: For Scott to relax I kind of just want to give a basic overview.

523
00:32:53,590 --> 00:33:09,784
Rym: But as we said last week Scott and I are going to for a while now alternate between talking about our respective majors computer science and information technology and Scott spent much of last week Describing well last Monday at least talking about what computer science and programming and all those things really were.

524
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:16,290
Rym: so to dispel the myths The legends and everything that you thought you knew about information technology.

525
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:23,269
Rym: Here we go because you see IT is Actually a super new degree a super new program.

526
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:27,905
Rym: IT did not exist as it does today in this world until very recently.

527
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:41,489
Rym: in fact the first Information technology program at a real university with a bachelor's that was accredited was formed in 1991 by of all places the Rochester Institute of Technology my alma mater.

528
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:50,930
Rym: It turns out you know I think I've mentioned this before that I actually studied IT at the first and foremost IT school in the world.

529
00:33:51,652 --> 00:33:54,441
Scott: I studied CS at the first and foremost IT school in the world.

530
00:33:54,641 --> 00:34:04,869
Rym: ha but actually up there that for computer science RIT was in the first I think five Universities to have a computer science bachelor's something like that back in the 70s something like that.

531
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:09,690
Rym: So yeah, RIT is I mean, it's not super known outside of its circles.

532
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:16,183
Rym: But if you're a young punk kid and you're thinking about information technology And you got a lot of money you pretty much or you can get a scholarship.

533
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:18,958
Rym: if you're a national marriage scholar you realize They'll give you a full ride.

534
00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:19,503
Rym: Mm-hmm.

535
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:23,056
Rym: But anyway RIT is the IT school.

536
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:26,103
Rym: IT began there and IT is on the bleeding edge there.

537
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:29,754
Rym: So what is Information technology?

538
00:34:29,815 --> 00:34:37,650
Rym: because it's actually kind of complicated and since it's a new degree How we've had computers and we've had IT relatively new for a long time.

539
00:34:38,051 --> 00:34:39,918
Rym: So how come there were no what?

540
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:42,125
Rym: where were people getting these jobs?

541
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:43,429
Rym: How are people doing these jobs?

542
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:46,109
Scott: If there were no idea learning on the job, they were learning at home.

543
00:34:46,362 --> 00:35:03,490
Rym: well the answer is that the majority of computer workers pretty much from the beginning of computing until Now and even now it's really hasn't changed much yet We're untrained people who learned as they went had no actual formal training in computers or IT or anything like that.

544
00:35:04,272 --> 00:35:10,730
Rym: And that is the cause behind the majority of the kind of clusterfucks of computing that exists today.

545
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:17,350
Rym: You see when computers were they first existed there wasn't that much to know about computers.

546
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:22,124
Rym: so computer science kind of encompassed everything that computers were.

547
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:25,650
Rym: and then as time went on Computers got too complicated.

548
00:35:25,753 --> 00:35:39,149
Rym: I mean Computers as a physical thing became so complex that you could devote your entire bachelor's or even master's study to just how computers worked physically how they were put together electronics and that is computer engineering.

549
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:40,753
Rym: and Then there were people.

550
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:41,979
Rym: and so that kind of split off.

551
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,109
Rym: and then you had computer science, which is everything else.

552
00:35:44,672 --> 00:35:46,841
Rym: but as time went on I'm gonna skip over a lot of this.

553
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:58,477
Rym: but bit by bit every sort of Major every sort of discipline everything that could be split off has been bit by bit being split off from computer science Computer science itself split off.

554
00:35:58,497 --> 00:36:09,630
Rym: computer science is now effectively the art of programming But even that is split into computer science and software engineering and all these kind of specialties are brancing out from the core.

555
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:14,869
Rym: And it's come to the point that Information technology is the glue that connects everything together.

556
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:22,429
Rym: IT is in one hand the catch-all for anything and everything related to computers that does not have its own specialist discipline.

557
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:39,550
Rym: and more importantly Information technology is the degree the program the idea the study the field of practice that Kind of has the overview that knows enough about every single discipline to be able to manage computer environments.

558
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:53,590
Rym: I mean say you've got a company and you want to write some software you want to do something cool All right, you got to hire some CS guys to actually write your software Maybe some software engineering guys to kind of manage the software projects, but what about your infrastructure?

559
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:59,970
Rym: You don't want the same people writing your code Managing your routers, I mean most people actually a lot of companies.

560
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,201
Scott: That's exactly what happens.

561
00:37:01,282 --> 00:37:02,049
Rym: and that is not.

562
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,941
Scott: They can only hire one or two computer guys and they need both.

563
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,850
Scott: so they get someone who has more than one skill set.

564
00:37:09,231 --> 00:37:14,347
Rym: Yes, the problem is that usually does not work very well except in very very small environment.

565
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:18,756
Scott: Well, even if it works Well the person, you know that usually means that the person who is doing.

566
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:25,320
Rym: all that work is overworked and a lot of companies even have a lot of Misunderstandings as to what information technology is.

567
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,365
Rym: a lot of big companies.

568
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:27,470
Rym: Look at it as almost a buzzword.

569
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:33,066
Rym: Yep, we leverage RIT synergy to utilize our efficiency and that sort of bullshit.

570
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:43,549
Rym: or even worse A lot of companies seem to think that you know, they have problems in their company and it's easy to say Oh those problems can be solved by technology, which is usually true.

571
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:47,561
Rym: Let's just get an IT department and everything will go away.

572
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:49,807
Rym: and that doesn't work at all.

573
00:37:50,148 --> 00:38:07,289
Rym: because IT Basically all IT does in a company in any sort of real working environment is Make sure that all of the technology that is being used by a company or by an organization is used Effectively and as to the fullness that it can be used.

574
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:11,816
Rym: that is in a nutshell all that IT is all to IT exists.

575
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:21,340
Rym: to do is make sure that you're using the technology you have as Best you can and also to recommend new technology and then once that is implemented to use it effectively.

576
00:38:22,228 --> 00:38:24,986
Rym: That seems really simple Doesn't doesn't that seem simple?

577
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:31,910
Scott: No, actually, I know it's not simple because Unless your company is one dude with one computer.

578
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:34,900
Scott: It's gonna be there's a lot of crazy stuff going on.

579
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:37,057
Rym: Well, see this is where the problem is.

580
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:45,060
Rym: Most of the workforce in the world today in the information technology industry do not have information technology degrees.

581
00:38:45,622 --> 00:39:00,115
Rym: people like me are the vast vast minority in the workforce and As a result, we have a lot of these sort of IT Organizations that aren't really doing what IT should be doing a lot of times.

582
00:39:00,356 --> 00:39:15,754
Rym: They'll call it the IT department but then the IT department is full of people writing code and full of people writing the software that runs the business or full of people just doing all the sort of Computer geeky stuff that the CFO and the CEO don't really understand.

583
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,681
Rym: They lump it over into the IT department and Really?

584
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:25,720
Rym: You've kind of got to have a an idea of what IT is and then you've got to actually organize your your stuff.

585
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:28,070
Rym: I mean, I'm trying to not get into the details here.

586
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,600
Rym: That's why it might sound like I'm dancing around a lot of issues.

587
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:34,639
Rym: That's because I'm very purposely dancing around a lot of dance dance for me.

588
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:40,680
Rym: But you've got to understand that IT is not a revenue generating center.

589
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:45,000
Rym: Computer science in a company should be a revenue generating center.

590
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:45,723
Scott: It could be.

591
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:45,783
Scott: it

592
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:46,646
Rym: should be

593
00:39:47,008 --> 00:39:50,884
Scott: unless you're selling the software if you're just using the software for yourself Maybe not

594
00:39:51,226 --> 00:40:01,907
Rym: but even then if you're writing software for yourself Most likely you would have been better served by having an IT department that seeks out pre-existing solutions and then implements them for you

595
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:04,734
Scott: unless there is no pre-existing solution and

596
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:13,040
Rym: in which case then you would probably have an IT department that would hire people in a small CS development environment to write that software.

597
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:15,500
Rym: But technically the IT department would manage it.

598
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:29,360
Rym: The IT department would put in the feature requests the bug fixes all that and the CS department should primarily be implementation May be headed up by a software engineer who manages all of that and provides the interface for the IT department.

599
00:40:29,842 --> 00:40:44,838
Rym: but there's a lot of companies that end up having this sort of cross relationship where IT people talk directly to CS people who then go over the software engineer's head and all these interconnections kind of really make things difficult to manage.

600
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:51,416
Rym: and Thus I'm going to get into what IT is directly because here are all the things that IT is.

601
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:53,943
Rym: IT is Network monitoring.

602
00:40:54,505 --> 00:41:04,140
Rym: IT is managing the development of the software that you use But not the software that makes your business go necessarily or that you were selling.

603
00:41:04,902 --> 00:41:10,960
Rym: IT is security all security computer security software security network security.

604
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:14,190
Rym: IT is technology workflow management.

605
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:19,767
Rym: You know, I said you don't want all these connections people talking to people especially once you get into a larger organization.

606
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:34,940
Rym: what IT does is it sets up the workflows and Manages the workflows using technology so that like say you have people who write software for your company Right, and then you have people who use that software and then you have people who manage both sides of those people.

607
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:57,660
Rym: the IT person's job is to set up technology like wiki's or knowledge bases or ticketing systems or workflow systems or Like purchase asset management change tracking systems to kind of control all of these workflows and track all of these workflows So that everyone can get their job done and people aren't forced to do work that could be done better by someone else.

608
00:41:58,302 --> 00:42:05,193
Rym: Like I'm a CS guy and I'm writing my code I shouldn't need to prioritize Which bug fixes are important in which bug fixes aren't.

609
00:42:05,454 --> 00:42:06,760
Rym: that's the software engineer's job.

610
00:42:07,322 --> 00:42:15,851
Rym: The software engineer shouldn't have to guess at what's important and what's not important to the business the IT department and through them all the other departments of the company.

611
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:19,427
Rym: there should be some sort of process for managing that and As you can see.

612
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:20,296
Rym: I could go on and on.

613
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:21,986
Rym: IT is everything.

614
00:42:22,488 --> 00:42:25,180
Rym: IT is both the simplest and the most complex part of an organization.

615
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:32,412
Rym: IT is the most misunderstood part of any organization and Almost no one in the world is trained in what IT actually is.

616
00:42:32,473 --> 00:42:36,046
Rym: so you can see where there might be problems Maybe maybe.

617
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:46,559
Rym: so what I want to do in you know My coming shows is I'm gonna break IT up into as tiny chunks as I can and talk about them in as much detail As I think you can handle.

618
00:42:52,923 --> 00:42:55,532
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.
