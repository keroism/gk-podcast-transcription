1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,578
Scott: It's Thursday, May 15th.

2
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:12,621
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:13,364
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:14,848
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:17,598
Scott: Tonight, Geek Profiles #1 with Thade.

6
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,908
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:36,365
Scott: Okay, so we told you in weeks past that on Thursdays we're gonna start to change it up.

8
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:38,915
Scott: And this is the first Thursday where we're gonna change it up.

9
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:40,060
Rym: Oh, snap.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,883
Scott: Oh, snaps.

11
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:43,800
Scott: We have today a special guest on the GeekNights.

12
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:45,799
Scott: Introduce yourself special guest.

13
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,083
Guest: Good evening, everyone.

14
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:48,684
Guest: It's Thade.

15
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:52,312
Guest: Hopefully, this isn't an entirely unfamiliar voice.

16
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:53,876
Scott: No, well, I don't know.

17
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:56,483
Scott: People... Do you mind?

18
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,580
Scott: Like, it seems like people are starting to call like Friday Night Partyline, like GeekNights Friday.

19
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:02,959
Scott: Is that like upset you or what?

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,280
Guest: The last time that we did the show, though, we had really it was just you guys that were from the forum.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,888
Guest: I mean, Friday Night Partyline originated before I even came to your forum and stuff.

22
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:21,862
Guest: I don't mind what people think about it, but it's not that.

23
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:27,516
Guest: And it's going in a different direction now anyway with the guests that we're adding.

24
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:29,878
Scott: Much like our Thursday show.

25
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,060
Scott: It's going in a different direction right this minute.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:44,662
Scott: All right, so I think the general idea here is, at least my idea, is you know, sometimes you get a guest on a show who's like, you know, some sort of famous person and you have to interview them.

27
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:44,943
Scott: Right.

28
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:53,560
Scott: But, you know, I figure, you know, I guess Thade, there is some special things about you and you're, I guess, semi-famous and talented in ways.

29
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:55,440
Rym: Well, you're so generous.

30
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:56,225
Scott: I am.

31
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:56,738
Scott: I am.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,700
Scott: So magnanimous.

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,625
Scott: Look at, I am so benevolent.

34
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:00,829
Scott: Look, look upon.

35
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:01,270
Scott: All right.

36
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:13,870
Scott: That, you know, my idea is that we could do sort of like these like geek profile kind of things, you know, where we could like ask the same questions or similar questions to like a bunch of different geeky people.

37
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:27,000
Scott: And you can sort of look at all the different geeks around the world and how they're the same and how they're different, because that's sort of, you know, the core philosophy of GeekNights is that, look, all these people are geeky and geekiness is awesome and such.

38
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,040
Scott: And also, I think we're going to start it off.

39
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:33,079
Scott: I told you to get a news in the thing of the day.

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,940
Scott: But I forgot that we sort of wanted to can the news on Thursday, which is fine because.

41
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,140
Rym: Well, maybe not necessarily can it, but have bits other than, oh, my God, we talk about the news.

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,081
Scott: Yeah.

43
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:54,560
Scott: And I kind of want to make, you know, obviously when we, you know, when you ever have a guest on the show, it always takes forever.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,099
Scott: You know, it's going to be a long one.

45
00:02:56,341 --> 00:03:03,920
Scott: And I kind of want to be able to cook and eat dinner before a reasonable hour, even though I know that's not going to happen because I'm looking at the clock already and it's upsetting.

46
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:11,360
Scott: But you had a very, very interesting news and it gave us an idea for a possible Thursday bit.

47
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:14,199
Scott: So tell us about your news and then we will discuss it.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Guest: My news, Scott, is about trains in India.

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,007
Guest: And the headline is Mumbai.

50
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:23,654
Guest: trains kill 20,000 in five years.

51
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:28,039
Scott: That's like an insane number, like.

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,262
Guest: Yes.

53
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:31,359
Guest: Well, you have to imagine what these trains are like.

54
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:35,520
Guest: If they have doors at all, it's unusual.

55
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,220
Guest: They have barred windows, but no glass.

56
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,999
Guest: And unlike in Japan, where everybody is really orderly in getting on the train, these trains are just a mob scene every day.

57
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:57,419
Guest: People are hanging off the roof, they're hanging out of the windows and they're jammed in way beyond any sort of capacity that the trains are designed for.

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,980
Rym: I mean, I've seen pictures of these on Fark.

59
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,920
Rym: I mean, they're often an object of ridicule on Fark, but you know that everything is ridiculed on Fark.

60
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,939
Rym: But you see these things.

61
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:10,520
Rym: And if you just see this picture without context, you would look at it and think, wow, that's a joke.

62
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,980
Rym: That is not an actual daily occurrence.

63
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,019
Scott: Yeah, it looks like one of those things where it's how many people can you cram in a phone booth, you know?

64
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:22,700
Guest: But here, I mean, 10 people a day are dying on these trains.

65
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:36,020
Guest: So if you think you have a bad commute or your train is messy or you're sitting next to a smelly guy, imagine being crammed in beyond what humans should endure and then risking your life every day.

66
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,800
Scott: I mean, in Japan, they pack them in pretty tight.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:45,318
Scott: They actually have guys who will push the people into the train, you know, but it's nowhere near this bad, not even close.

68
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,093
Guest: Smell.

69
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:55,720
Scott: So, yeah, so like there's a lot of things I was thinking of that they could do to sort of fix this problem.

70
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,280
Rym: But that's very easy to say.

71
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,339
Rym: Oh, well, they could do this.

72
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,660
Rym: I know that because if they had the resources to do something effective, it probably would have been done.

73
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,100
Scott: I know that sort of it's sort of one of those things where, yes, they're obviously not going to do this because of, you know, realistic reasons like that.

74
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,880
Scott: But it's fun to try to, you know, think of solutions to something like this from like, you know, an engineering sort of nerdy standpoint.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,020
Scott: Like I was thinking, well, why did they even have train cars?

76
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:33,038
Scott: Why don't they just have like, you know, like a big, long platform, you know, that that just moves around the tracks, like in a big circle, really slowly, constantly, you know, or something like that?

77
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:34,880
Guest: Like at the airport?

78
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:36,766
Scott: Yeah, sort of like at the airport.

79
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:52,660
Scott: or maybe like you have one train, you know, if you didn't have a big metal train car, if you just had, you know, one engine and like, say, you know, just seats on boards, you know, just something like that was much more open and you could weigh a lot less.

80
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,300
Scott: And that's one train engine could pull a lot more.

81
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:57,180
Scott: You could be spread out a lot more.

82
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:59,318
Scott: You know, maybe you could just I don't know.

83
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:04,760
Scott: It seems like that might actually be pretty cheap to do, you know, if someone actually thought of it.

84
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,322
Scott: I mean, the safety concerns, if you fall off, you could get run over by the train, but it wouldn't be moving that fast.

85
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:25,362
Rym: Well, I think the more fundamental problem is that if you look at the sort of governmental and civil infrastructure of nations like India, there's very little civic planning in most cases and a lot of corruption and such to the point that even if there was a good idea, I mean, how could you possibly implement it?

86
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:30,060
Rym: The trains are the way they are, partly because no one is effectively tried to make a solution.

87
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:39,397
Guest: And the huge population, I mean, we're talking about a rail system that ferries seven million commuters every day.

88
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,580
Scott: No, that's like more than all the people in New York City.

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:43,902
Scott: Right.

90
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:45,000
Scott: How many people are in the city?

91
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:52,520
Rym: Well, the thing is, we have a very extensive transit infrastructure in New York, but the population of New York grew a lot more slowly than the population in India.

92
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,960
Rym: There was a lot of time to adapt.

93
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:59,623
Rym: And also we have we have superhighways in the car culture and there's all these alternate ways of getting around.

94
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:01,960
Scott: I mean, there are cars in India, but you've seen that video.

95
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:03,918
Scott: Good luck with that.

96
00:07:04,981 --> 00:07:10,040
Guest: Plus, you know, when you're making a couple dollars a day, you know, you're not going to be able to buy a car.

97
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,640
Rym: I mean, a lot of Americans can't even afford to have cars or they have cars, but really they'd be better off if somehow they're away where they could just use some sort of public transit.

98
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,580
Rym: I mean, the cost of ownership of a car in the U.S.

99
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,383
Rym: is staggering.

100
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:28,037
Rym: Our friend Conrad really he's desperate to find a way to just be able to get rid of his car and never own one again.

101
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:30,323
Scott: Hmm.

102
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:33,760
Scott: Yeah, it's like I take the train to work, but I still have to have the car.

103
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,100
Scott: It's like, you know, or else I'd be screwed.

104
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,320
Scott: I wouldn't be able to get groceries at the grocery store.

105
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,580
Scott: I wouldn't be able to go to my parents' house.

106
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,364
Scott: You know, it's it's.

107
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:43,659
Scott: It's really not fair.

108
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:45,639
Guest: Depends on where you live, too.

109
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,998
Scott: I mean, if I lived in in the city or in one of the boroughs, you know, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn, I wouldn't need a car.

110
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:58,440
Scott: And it's actually difficult to have a car because I'd have to pay for somewhere to park it.

111
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,620
Rym: But remember, I grew up in the Midwest where there there were barely even buses.

112
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,620
Rym: I'd never seen a taxi in person until I got to New York.

113
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,300
Rym: It's just it's a totally different world.

114
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,077
Rym: There's no trains.

115
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:12,900
Guest: And you wouldn't take a bus in Detroit anyway.

116
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,439
Scott: I don't even take a bus in New York City, not because I'm like afraid of it or anything, but because I just don't trust.

117
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:27,039
Rym: Well, I think it's more because we tend to restrict ourselves to Manhattan and occasionally the Bronx where there's no reason to ever take a bus.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,840
Scott: The subways go everywhere except the Javits or they go close enough for you to walk.

119
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,260
Rym: But if you're going to the airport or you're in any other borough, the buses are actually great.

120
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:42,797
Scott: Yeah, I guess if I was you know, if I had to go somewhere and the bus was like the only going anywhere in Brooklyn that isn't near a subway, just take the bus.

121
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:43,559
Rym: or if you live in Brooklyn.

122
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,440
Scott: Like my cousins live in Queens and they could go to the subway, take the train.

123
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:51,520
Scott: But they like the express bus is closer to their house and is, you know, faster.

124
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,740
Scott: But it's a little bit more expensive.

125
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Scott: I think it's like five dollars.

126
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,221
Rym: Great.

127
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,239
Rym: So obviously then the solution is we just need to build subways in India.

128
00:08:58,643 --> 00:08:59,719
Scott: It's not a bad idea.

129
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,646
Rym: Yes, it is.

130
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:01,779
Rym: It's a terrible idea.

131
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,559
Scott: Well, you got to build enough of them.

132
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,261
Rym: It's not.

133
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:07,800
Rym: even subways aren't long distance or even medium distance transit.

134
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:10,393
Rym: They can't go very far, at least by the way.

135
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,560
Rym: we design modern subways.

136
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:20,080
Rym: And considering that the part of the problem in India is that they don't have the money to build a more robust infrastructure, they're not going to build a depressurized underground super train.

137
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:31,800
Scott: I guess they're not going to make a super train, but, you know, I don't know, they could build sort of like an amusement park thing where there's just a constant like this string of like, you know, little two seaters that just this third constant is two seat or two seat or two seat.

138
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,115
Scott: You know, I don't know.

139
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,139
Guest: You have population density like that.

140
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:36,660
Guest: Human life has less value.

141
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:37,726
Guest: They don't care.

142
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:38,814
Guest: They don't care if 20,000 people die.

143
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,839
Guest: They're not going to change anything.

144
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:43,879
Guest: They're pouring as much money as they can into it now.

145
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:47,620
Guest: But it's not enough to keep up with the pace of population growth.

146
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:57,140
Rym: I mean, I think there's also the point of even if individual people care in the system, the system itself, I mean, you know, a bureaucracy gets to the point where it maintains itself.

147
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,319
Rym: And the system takes a lot more work to make it care than any individual person working within it.

148
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:05,460
Scott: It's depressing.

149
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,417
Scott: And, you know, I think the train like on Thanksgiving, sometimes our train will be filled up to the point where, you know, people are standing in the aisles.

150
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:16,560
Scott: But that's not crowded at all compared to this.

151
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:21,106
Rym: Of course, you look at a lot of people on that train and to them, it's the end of the goddamn world.

152
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:22,700
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

153
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:29,619
Scott: Imagine I should take I should print out pictures of the India train and like tape them to the walls on the New York train.

154
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:34,602
Rym: I mean, actually, today my train was delayed by about five minutes because there was rain and all this.

155
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:36,800
Scott: Well, they're doing something to one of the tracks up near Beacon.

156
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:37,999
Scott: I was I was delayed also.

157
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,039
Rym: Yeah, but it was also because of the rain which delayed the work with blah, blah, blah.

158
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,459
Rym: But we were delayed like five minutes.

159
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:50,500
Rym: And when the conductor announces like, I apologize for the delay, we're going kind of slowly due to rain and construction, we'll be arriving about five minutes late.

160
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,319
Rym: And this guy sitting a little ways down goes, Son of a goddamn it.

161
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,160
Rym: My tax dollars, Metro North, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

162
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,948
Rym: This is bullshit.

163
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:00,000
Rym: This is worse than Amtrak.

164
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,120
Rym: And he's just going on and on and on to himself.

165
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:09,805
Rym: And all I could think was, dude, not only is Metro North not paid for by your tax dollars and profitable.

166
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,477
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

167
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:21,740
Rym: I mean, Amtrak, you can complain about if you're, say, you know, out in the middle of nowhere where it sucks, but you mean out in the middle of nowhere where they shouldn't be using trains, where buses and hubs would be much more efficient?

168
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,526
Scott: Exactly.

169
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,153
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

170
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:31,552
Rym: Yeah.

171
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:36,010
Rym: So things of the day, I'll admit this is quite a cop out.

172
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,628
Rym: This is one of those backup things today.

173
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,328
Rym: I kind of keep around for when I didn't see anything worthwhile on the Internet.

174
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:42,830
Rym: that wasn't already on CollegeHumor.

175
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:45,469
Rym: I'm not going to tell you how I found this.

176
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:55,428
Rym: It I will not admit that I was just sitting around looking up pictures upon videos, upon movies, upon everything I could find of puppies and baby foxes.

177
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:56,826
Scott: And that's your default.

178
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,970
Scott: Find the cute animals.

179
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,551
Rym: Yes.

180
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:02,850
Rym: But this one, Shiba Inu are incredible dogs.

181
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,090
Rym: They're incredibly, amazingly intelligent.

182
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:12,030
Rym: But as a result, they're really whiny and they're very talkative and they're very difficult for a lot of people to deal with because they're smart and they're obstinate.

183
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:19,791
Rym: And well, this Shiba Inu has encountered an intruder in his space and the way he reacts to it.

184
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:23,908
Rym: And of course, more so than that, the nature of the intruder is kind of epic.

185
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,250
Rym: I don't think I'll even let on to what the intruder is.

186
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,341
Rym: I think you should watch the video to get the kind of.

187
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:35,930
Scott: I'm feeling like I might want to spoil your secret, because every time I try to lead people into something and secret it up, you spoil it.

188
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,930
Rym: When was the last time I did that yesterday?

189
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:47,729
Rym: See, I have words about the way you were trying to review that show that for a Wednesday when I try to do a show on how to review a show.

190
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,875
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

191
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,649
Scott: Well, yeah, that's going to be a good show.

192
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:51,573
Scott: All right.

193
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:53,650
Scott: I'll do my thing today and then then you can go, Thade.

194
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,551
Scott: All right.

195
00:12:54,591 --> 00:13:07,649
Scott: So my company, you know, last year we did some softball and it didn't go so well because you sort of like all this, all the sort of company sports leagues in the city, they require you to have like, you know, X players show up or else you lose.

196
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,670
Scott: And they require you to have like, you know, a mix of male and female players.

197
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,090
Scott: And that's that's all well and good.

198
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,630
Scott: Those are good rules that they have there.

199
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,550
Scott: But my company had very, very few people total.

200
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:24,810
Scott: So it was very difficult to get a whole softball team together, you know, on this, you know, the times and the schedules for the games.

201
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:28,550
Scott: And a lot of the games will be far away from our office, like way uptown.

202
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,950
Scott: And no one wanted to go, you know, so it didn't last very long.

203
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:40,070
Scott: But actually, we were looking around, you know, because some of us in the office still kind of want to do some sort of office sport of some kind.

204
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:46,090
Scott: And we found this really cool website, Zog Sports dot com, Zog Sports dot com.

205
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,800
Scott: And check this out.

206
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,408
Scott: This is way cool.

207
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:54,012
Scott: You they have basically, you know, sports leagues for, you know, amateur nonprofessional teams.

208
00:13:54,654 --> 00:14:02,982
Scott: They let you play, you know, either like ultra casual, casual or, you know, kind of weak, actually caring about winning and losing, you know, playing.

209
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:07,250
Scott: all the money that, you know, you give to them to sort of join the leagues.

210
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:07,812
Scott: Right.

211
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:16,110
Scott: They use that to, you know, rent the fields and the equipment and all that stuff and pay the umpires or whatever sort of officials they need to to referee the games.

212
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:19,150
Scott: But the rest of the money all goes to charities and such.

213
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:20,483
Scott: And when you win.

214
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:20,604
Scott: Right.

215
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,390
Scott: If your team wins, the prize you get is a cash prize to the charity of your choice.

216
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,510
Scott: So winning is sort of like you get to pick the charity.

217
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:34,696
Scott: And the best part about this whole thing is that it's not just sort of your normal sports, even though it is.

218
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:35,930
Rym: They have volleyball in there.

219
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,230
Scott: Well, let me let me list some of the sports here.

220
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,544
Scott: We got touch footballs.

221
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,029
Scott: We got kickball.

222
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:50,870
Scott: We got wiffle ball and the rest are, you know, indoor soccer, outdoor soccer, volleyball, basketball, kickball.

223
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,678
Scott: I said kickball.

224
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,650
Scott: Oh, and dodgeball.

225
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:53,297
Scott: That's right.

226
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:54,330
Scott: Oh, and coming.

227
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:54,834
Rym: Wait a minute.

228
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:55,281
Rym: Wait a minute.

229
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:55,830
Rym: Dodgeball.

230
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,910
Rym: There's a lot of ways to play.

231
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:02,410
Scott: Coming soon, whitewater rafting, surfing and beach trip and wine tasting.

232
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,611
Scott: How about that?

233
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:06,899
Scott: So, yeah, it's good stuff.

234
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,680
Guest: Sounds like the Cleveland Sport and Social Club we had here a few years ago.

235
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:23,618
Scott: Yeah, I'm always wanting to do something like that, but it's not easy to get it together unless you you know, you live down there, because I mean, if I stay after work for like a kickball game.

236
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:25,329
Guest: It's covered.

237
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,420
Guest: You'd meet girls.

238
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,659
Scott: Yeah, maybe.

239
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:33,879
Scott: Maybe they said that, like, you know, after games, they like they pay for you to like go out and drink or whatever.

240
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:35,225
Guest: Well, there you go.

241
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:37,800
Guest: They could have some orange juice for you or something.

242
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,564
Scott: Yeah, I'm sure.

243
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,520
Scott: All right.

244
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,239
Scott: You have a thing of the day?

245
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:46,538
Guest: Yes, my thing of the day is Muto, a wall painted animation by Blue.

246
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:52,960
Guest: And this is a short film by this guy named Blue who did it in Buenos Aires.

247
00:15:53,442 --> 00:16:05,660
Guest: What he did, which must have taken I can't even imagine how much paint and how much time this took, but he did an animation like you would on paper on a wall with graffiti.

248
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:15,680
Guest: So he did this whole movie of this, this, this animation and this wall going inside, outside, down the street, into holes, all of these things.

249
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,120
Guest: At times it gets to be two or three stories tall.

250
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:25,240
Guest: The amount of labor that went into this is just, I mean, it must have taken months.

251
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,679
Scott: Are you sure it wasn't like digitally aided?

252
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:31,100
Guest: No, no, this is, this is, this is Buenos Aires.

253
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,660
Guest: I mean, this is, this is Latin America.

254
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:34,620
Guest: This is old school.

255
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,300
Guest: This is, you know, a camera and a guy with a lot of paint and a lot of time.

256
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:53,939
Guest: But, you know, the style of animation, I mean, you've seen, I guess I'd describe it as the human form going through various mutations, you know, people climbing out of their own skin and shapes for heads.

257
00:16:54,841 --> 00:17:05,460
Guest: And I mean, the animation, I think we've all seen it before, but just the fact that it's done as graffiti and it's, and it's animated, I mean, the, the effort is, is stunning.

258
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:11,457
Scott: I was, I started to watch the video, but then I stopped and I haven't seen it, so I don't really know.

259
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:20,280
Scott: But, you know, I mean, it is posted on the internet, so there's obviously some, you know, don't like think, oh, it's somewhere that's, you know, I don't think about.

260
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,016
Scott: They don't have any technology because they do.

261
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,300
Scott: All right, so basically what I'm going to go for here is, is I'm going to, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions.

262
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,920
Scott: You don't have to answer all of them if you don't want to, but I hope that this will take us somewhere interesting.

263
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:36,200
Scott: And this is sort of the experiment for the future.

264
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:40,680
Rym: Yeah, everyone out there for good or ill, this episode is mostly Scott, if you can't tell.

265
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,259
Rym: I'm kind of just chilling back.

266
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,533
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

267
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:53,576
Scott: And so I want all listeners out there who are who are listening to this show to make comments on it, you know, because we're going to sort of try to continue this.

268
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:55,778
Scott: maybe or maybe not if you all hate it.

269
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,140
Rym: But hopefully it'll be good as long as you keep the energy up.

270
00:17:59,385 --> 00:17:59,940
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

271
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,018
Scott: I'm trying to keep the energy up.

272
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:01,900
Scott: All right.

273
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,299
Scott: So the first question I'm going to ask you, right.

274
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:06,500
Scott: So you are a GeekNights listener.

275
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:07,299
Scott: Yes, obviously.

276
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:08,979
Guest: Yes, yes, I am.

277
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,920
Scott: How did you find GeekNights?

278
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:12,398
Guest: Oh, wow.

279
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:13,499
Guest: I don't remember.

280
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:14,639
Guest: It's been a while.

281
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:26,840
Guest: I was looking for a good podcast to listen to, and I was just going through, I probably did some searches, some indexes on technology related things.

282
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,698
Guest: And I don't know, I think that I just I would listen to a couple of shows and just weed them out.

283
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:37,880
Guest: And if the sound quality was bad, that I that just kills me immediately.

284
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:39,559
Guest: So you guys have always had good sound.

285
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:43,660
Rym: Well, well, you never heard the special episodes.

286
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,460
Guest: The ones that you won't tell people about on the forums.

287
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,298
Guest: They're out there.

288
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:55,539
Scott: I mean, even even the non, you know, the early episodes that weren't special, if you listen to those, they're really terrible compared to like what we're doing right now.

289
00:18:56,482 --> 00:18:59,980
Guest: I mean, I was listening to Adam Curry when I first started listening to podcasts.

290
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:01,780
Scott: I did, too, and I don't anymore.

291
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,039
Guest: No, no, he's still doing it.

292
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,040
Guest: But I didn't know that or whatever.

293
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,000
Guest: I it's not.

294
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:16,239
Guest: But once you get you find shows that that cater to your interests, then, you know, you gravitate toward those.

295
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,479
Guest: And then I was interested enough to start doing podcasting.

296
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:25,354
Guest: And I think it was about the same time that I started.

297
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,737
Guest: Friday Night Partyline is when I started listening to your show.

298
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:30,538
Scott: So so why do you like our show?

299
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,705
Guest: Well, I think that it's.

300
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:42,080
Guest: you know, you guys obviously have a terrific sense of comic timing and you you work very well together.

301
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:47,700
Guest: But for me, it's probably the fact that you don't hold back.

302
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,619
Guest: You don't try to dumb it down.

303
00:19:50,521 --> 00:20:00,780
Guest: My whole life, I have searched for people and through things that that aren't dumbed down because our society and our culture is geared toward the sixth grade reading level.

304
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,640
Guest: And and, you know, Rym is always people are always busting his traps about being elitist.

305
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,879
Guest: And my thought is, come on, you know, step up.

306
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,020
Rym: Jeez, it works for Barack Obama.

307
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,783
Rym: It'll work for me.

308
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:14,357
Guest: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,751
Guest: I agree with you on so many things from except for for Mr.

310
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:21,620
Rym: Obama, but we'll have to have a little post show discussion.

311
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,263
Rym: I'm curious.

312
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:25,442
Scott: I wanted to start a lot of discussions, but I don't know if I want to start that one.

313
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:31,740
Guest: Yeah, I hate talking about politics on the Internet and on Twitter and all these people talking about their political views.

314
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:40,503
Rym: And I don't know, I think I'd like talking about politics with you on the show, especially because Scott will never, ever talk about politics and doesn't know anything and doesn't care.

315
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,500
Scott: So, you know, I care a little.

316
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,840
Scott: I just don't care that much.

317
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:50,659
Scott: And it's mostly, you know, over, you know, for the earlier part of my life, I didn't know, you know, right from left.

318
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:56,202
Scott: And then once I knew, you know, just discussing it was like, you know, at one point it was interesting.

319
00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:59,680
Scott: But then lately it's just frustrating because everybody's crazy.

320
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:15,020
Scott: I just before we go out and everyone argues from emotion and everyone argues irrationally, everyone and most people, though, at least especially on the Internet, it's like it's very difficult to actually get a real political discussion focusing on, you know, because I always come at things you try.

321
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:20,507
Scott: I try to from like a political science standpoint, and most people sort of don't see that view.

322
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:21,820
Scott: And it's very difficult.

323
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,019
Scott: All right, anyway, so.

324
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:30,340
Scott: You've heard, you know, we've done like a bajillion GeekNights episodes, right?

325
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:37,336
Scott: Do you have an idea for for a GeekNights show topic that we haven't done that you would very much like?

326
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,760
Guest: Oh, Monday, Mondays and Thursdays are my favorite days.

327
00:21:42,120 --> 00:22:10,439
Guest: So if you just take the technology stuff that you know and then really don't hold back, if you're something that you're interested in professionally, where you like in your coding, you were saying you were complaining the other day about not being able to parse something, if you if you could take something that that you see in your day or some philosophical aspect of of of computer programming and then really go into it in detail, pretending like we're all at your level.

328
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:17,820
Guest: And then that way, as listeners, we can work to understand what you're saying as opposed to just saying, oh, I can't get my brain around that.

329
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:18,446
Guest: I forget it.

330
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:19,460
Guest: I'm not going to listen anymore.

331
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:21,560
Guest: That's kind of what I appreciate.

332
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,700
Guest: But that probably puts me in the minority of listeners.

333
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:31,400
Rym: Yeah, well, you wouldn't believe the amount of feedback we got when we way back tried to do this whole how computers work thing.

334
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:35,120
Rym: And we started, I think, with like flip flops and like the basics of electronics.

335
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,980
Scott: And I'm going to have to redo this video now, I think.

336
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,160
Rym: Yeah.

337
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:39,545
Rym: Well, the thing is pretty.

338
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:44,957
Rym: the emails we got were basically, wow, I'm stupid and I want it from a first grade level.

339
00:22:46,022 --> 00:22:49,280
Scott: Yeah, but we also got emails saying, wow, that was really great.

340
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:50,720
Scott: And it's so half and half.

341
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,798
Scott: We don't know which way to go.

342
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:59,042
Scott: And with those shows, our goal is sort of to actually help people understand how computers work.

343
00:22:59,102 --> 00:23:03,658
Scott: So it's if they're not going to understand it, then it's sort of like we're not achieving our goal.

344
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:12,865
Scott: You know, but on the other hand, we sort of you know, if people if we're saying things that are so dumb that no one's learning anything new, then it's also sort of not achieving our goal.

345
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:15,080
Rym: Well, it's tricky with particularly what I do.

346
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:25,580
Rym: I mean, I'm kind of apart from Scott and a lot of the other people we know technology wise and that everything I do is like enterprise level, like it's this totally different realm of computers and technology.

347
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:35,115
Rym: And it's it's something that has zero application in 90 percent of technology professionals lives and ninety nine percent of human beings lives like.

348
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:48,300
Rym: the topics are so esoteric and so specific and so just utterly, utterly I don't I mean, not necessarily difficult or beyond, but just not applicable in any way to people's lives.

349
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,301
Scott: Mm hmm.

350
00:23:50,904 --> 00:24:05,940
Guest: And a big call for Emily to be in the show more, I think that if you can interject someone else who is dynamic and and smart and of course female, then people are going to like most of your audience is male.

351
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:13,678
Scott: Yeah, we have a lot of, you know, other front row crew people, but, you know, they're not always nearby or they're not always willing.

352
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:21,900
Scott: You know, I mean, on New Year's, I tried to get one of our friends on the show because he's like an expert on many technological issues, even more so than than we are.

353
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,400
Scott: But he was like talking about James.

354
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,439
Scott: Yeah, but he didn't want to.

355
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,477
Scott: He was like, no, I don't want to.

356
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:31,239
Scott: And I'm like, oh, because I kind of wanted to hear what he had to say, because he, you know, he knows a lot more than I do.

357
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:35,218
Guest: Not everybody is an attention whore like we are.

358
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,460
Scott: No, I guess not.

359
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:39,458
Rym: Yeah, we started young at that, though.

360
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:42,642
Scott: All right.

361
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:51,040
Scott: So what other like podcasts or video internet shows do you listen to or watch frequently?

362
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:52,563
Guest: Oh, wow.

363
00:24:53,006 --> 00:24:55,680
Guest: I could give you a more complete list if I had my eye.

364
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,540
Rym: You don't have to be complete, just, you know, actually, it's probably better this way because instead of going through the list, it's kind of what was on your mind.

365
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:08,360
Rym: I mean, there's shows I nominally listen to and I'm subscribed to, but I don't think about them on a daily basis because I don't like them that much, to be honest.

366
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,980
Guest: I've really tried to go out and look for some more recently.

367
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,954
Guest: You know, since we worked with Dr.

368
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:21,839
Guest: Kiki, I pretty much have followed everything that she's doing from This Week in Media to This Week in Science.

369
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,719
Guest: There's all of the Leo Laporte podcasts are pretty good.

370
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,720
Scott: Yeah, I mostly only listen to Twit and the Floss Weekly.

371
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,818
Scott: The Floss Weekly, that's the best one, I have to say.

372
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:38,880
Guest: Net at Night, I think it's called with Amber McArthur.

373
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,577
Guest: That's really Amber McArthur is very pleasant to listen to.

374
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:47,939
Guest: And the CNET podcast, Buzz Out Loud.

375
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:49,579
Scott: Yeah, I've heard of that.

376
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,600
Guest: That's very good.

377
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,158
Guest: I mean, Molly Wood is one of those unique personalities, very fun to listen to.

378
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:06,079
Guest: Of course, Extra Life Radio, Scott Johnson, who we may or may not have a connection with here in the short future.

379
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,800
Scott: Yeah, we got too many Scott Johnsons.

380
00:26:09,324 --> 00:26:10,859
Scott: We got to find a way to separate them.

381
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:14,180
Rym: Yeah, our Scott Johnson is the one who actually knows about politics.

382
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:15,818
Rym: And I actually get to talk to him.

383
00:26:16,322 --> 00:26:18,940
Scott: Well, we don't know that the other Scott Johnson doesn't know about politics.

384
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:20,199
Rym: He's in our crew.

385
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,272
Rym: Yeah, he understands politics enough to where?

386
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:31,420
Rym: if you make a political science argument, he understands it and responds with an equally valid political science argument as opposed to a but McCain.

387
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:34,639
Scott: But it will be expressed with not much eloquence.

388
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:37,400
Scott: Hey, it's true.

389
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:38,048
Scott: He knows it.

390
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,738
Scott: He doesn't care.

391
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:41,074
Scott: All right.

392
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:43,259
Guest: There's a couple others.

393
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:51,800
Guest: Maximum PC, just because it's it's hard to find a really good hardware show.

394
00:26:53,443 --> 00:26:54,919
Guest: There's Maximum PC is good.

395
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,172
Guest: And there's another one.

396
00:26:57,845 --> 00:26:59,019
Guest: I can't think of the name of it.

397
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,280
Guest: It's Extreme Tech.

398
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,100
Guest: That's an Extreme Tech podcast, both hardware related shows.

399
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,480
Guest: And that's really as far as computer knowledge goes.

400
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,719
Guest: That's my strong point.

401
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,740
Guest: It's from a hobbyist perspective anyway.

402
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,840
Rym: I'll actually admit that I used to be that way.

403
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,119
Rym: And then in recent years, like I'm so divorced from the PC world that I don't even I wouldn't know what video card to buy.

404
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:24,060
Rym: I don't I have to look up to figure out what processor goes with what motherboard or which one's fast or what Northbridge is good anymore.

405
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,640
Scott: It took me a long time to build that computer, much longer than it would have in the past.

406
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,265
Scott: That's for sure.

407
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:29,659
Guest: It all comes back to you, though.

408
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:30,643
Scott: It does.

409
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:35,099
Scott: But it's sort of like you have to relearn like what acronyms match up with what others and all that business.

410
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:37,660
Guest: Someone in your forum suggested Geeks On.

411
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,160
Guest: I went back and I listened to the Joss Whedon episode that they had.

412
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,200
Guest: That was outstanding.

413
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:46,060
Guest: But I started listening to their latest show and they got a couple of things wrong.

414
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,560
Guest: And that just it's almost like bad sound to me.

415
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,741
Guest: If you if you don't know what you're talking about, then you shouldn't be talking about it.

416
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:56,225
Rym: They were using the word schadenfreude.

417
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,440
Guest: And I may have even mispronounced it, but but I know that it's German and not French.

418
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:07,352
Guest: Thank you very much.

419
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:07,959
Rym: Wow.

420
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,420
Scott: OK, because I was going to say, like, you know, we get things wrong.

421
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,760
Scott: Sometimes we even know we get them wrong.

422
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,506
Scott: But we do a good job of I think at least I think we do a good job of pretending we know what we're talking about.

423
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:25,640
Scott: And it's convincing that we're not bullshitting.

424
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:36,157
Rym: That's a problem I have when I when I sell things to people or I do my stuff and I tend to it's very easy to talk around anything I don't know and make it appear that I know a lot more than I may actually know.

425
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,959
Guest: Well, and I'm not being fair at all.

426
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,160
Guest: But, you know, if you do get it wrong, everybody makes mistakes.

427
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:45,260
Guest: Then correct yourself.

428
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,618
Guest: Don't try to hide it.

429
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,662
Scott: You know, I mean, if people call us if people call me out and I'm wrong, I always say I'm wrong.

430
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:59,700
Scott: You know, I just you know, but it's surprising how many episodes, like, especially when we used to sort of do like reading Wikipedia episodes.

431
00:29:00,123 --> 00:29:01,171
Scott: Oh, no one.

432
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:02,260
Scott: No one would call us out.

433
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,720
Rym: I remember there was one word way back where you're talking about programming.

434
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:13,820
Rym: And for like five minutes straight, you were talking about like object oriented and all these different kinds of programming and you just set them all backwards.

435
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,620
Rym: But no one noticed to this day.

436
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:16,288
Rym: I don't think.

437
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:16,836
Scott: Oh, wow.

438
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,159
Rym: Because we noticed it after the fact.

439
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,759
Rym: We're like, oh, man, we totally screwed that up.

440
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,559
Rym: But to this day, no one ever called us out on it.

441
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,919
Rym: And a lot of people listen to that episode.

442
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:30,160
Guest: I think podcasting is going through kind of a phase change right now.

443
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,640
Guest: People are trying to do innovative things.

444
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:44,137
Guest: If you look at Leo Laporte, he's doing twenty five hours of video now, he's trying to bring the world to Leo so he can stay in his area and then just not have to travel at all and people have to travel to him.

445
00:29:45,761 --> 00:30:01,480
Guest: I, Justine from Pittsburgh and Alex Lindsay from This Week in Media, we're just out there and it's kind of interesting to watch him sort of go into video because the way he describes it, it doesn't seem to be like he has a real plan.

446
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,139
Guest: And for me, I don't consume much video.

447
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,040
Guest: I mean, very, very little because there's no time.

448
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:15,919
Guest: I'm too busy doing the things that I do in my life, whereas with audio, I can listen to it in the car while I'm doing other things.

449
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:30,060
Guest: So in terms of my own podcasting stuff, I'm going to continue to explore audio, but I'm only going to do video as sort of special things for work and maybe some computer stuff.

450
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:33,860
Rym: That's definitely the direction we're going in with the whole video thing.

451
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:53,639
Scott: Yeah, it definitely seems, though, like his video is pretty much just showing the people's faces while they're recording the otherwise audio show, you know, to sort of just add the, you know, you can see the person's face, you know, element and maybe also, you know, if they're talking about a particular device or something, they can actually show it to you.

452
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,560
Scott: But it seems like that's all he's really doing with the video.

453
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:58,320
Scott: Is he doing more that I don't know about?

454
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:08,900
Guest: Oh, and I mean, if he's looking to try to turn this into a company, he can sell like, you know, CBS buying CNET for one point seven, five billion or however much they bought it for today.

455
00:31:09,522 --> 00:31:14,699
Guest: I think that someone like Kevin Rose is going to have a much better chance with revision three than he is with this.

456
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,440
Guest: I just don't know what you know.

457
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,960
Guest: How do you get advertisers for a thousand people that have nothing better to do but watch you do a podcast?

458
00:31:25,544 --> 00:31:25,926
Guest: I don't get.

459
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:27,860
Guest: I mean, I don't understand where the model is.

460
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:28,454
Guest: I don't know.

461
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:33,140
Rym: At least we've avoided that whole pitfall by just not trying to make money at all.

462
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:37,420
Scott: Well, we're not trying to make money with the GeekNights show.

463
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:52,960
Scott: Yeah, but you know what I mean, we've already I'm starting to find ways, you know, because I always said the GeekNights show is sort of like, you know, let's get out there and then we can do other things and then we'll have sort of like an installed audience for other things that may or may not make money, you know.

464
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,959
Scott: So it's sort of like if I would have done a project before, like let's say I would have made something like a game.

465
00:31:58,602 --> 00:32:01,622
Scott: You know, if I would have tried to sell that game, you know, it would be very difficult.

466
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:11,919
Scott: But now it's sort of like I have this this base and it's like if I do anything else, this base, I can easily draw their attention to it and sort of get off with like a little head start at anything I do.

467
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,139
Scott: So that's that's sort of what GeekNights is for.

468
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:16,363
Rym: All right.

469
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:21,378
Rym: Yeah, for me, though, it's just to keep my audience, I'll go crazy if I don't have a lot of people listening to my voice every day.

470
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,084
Scott: Yeah, that, too.

471
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,759
Guest: Attention whore, yes.

472
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:29,258
Guest: I mean, I'm as guilty as you are, I love it as much as you do.

473
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:45,799
Rym: Even we got in some of the other front row crew people as they brush with GeekNights, they do stuff with us where there's crowds or there's fans or anything, and they always come back and they kind of say they usually say something along the lines of, wow, it's kind of cool being on the other side of that velvet rope.

474
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,340
Scott: I know you're going to say a velvet rope.

475
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,039
Rym: Can I can I be behind that velvet rope again?

476
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,820
Scott: It'll be like you can be behind as many velvet ropes as you want.

477
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,347
Scott: All right.

478
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:56,849
Scott: So you are.

479
00:32:56,929 --> 00:32:59,914
Scott: you are quite a geeky person, obviously, if you're if you're liking the GeekNights.

480
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:00,199
Scott: Right.

481
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:01,042
Scott: Yeah.

482
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:02,208
Scott: So so what are your?

483
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,439
Scott: what are your primary geekeries?

484
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,520
Scott: Because, you know, we we're sort of got our hands on all the geekeries.

485
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:08,622
Guest: Right.

486
00:33:08,762 --> 00:33:12,740
Guest: Oh, and you've you've opened my eyes to other things, geek related.

487
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:19,260
Guest: I was only kind of into anime and I'm still nothing like you guys or some of the listeners.

488
00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:22,337
Scott: We're not even that much into anime as we used to be.

489
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,127
Guest: Or what's?

490
00:33:24,187 --> 00:33:24,994
Guest: what's her name, Tenshi.

491
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:27,320
Rym: Oh, and Neforum.

492
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,419
Guest: Yeah, it's her own show, too.

493
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,919
Guest: She's really, really into the animes.

494
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:36,559
Guest: But no, computer hardware is my primary geek area.

495
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:49,100
Guest: If I shared with you some of the computer things that I've got going on here in my home office that we've nicknamed Michigan, Michigan, Michigan, Mission Control.

496
00:33:50,024 --> 00:33:51,419
Guest: I have about 15 computers.

497
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,100
Guest: I Mac is the only non PC related.

498
00:33:57,121 --> 00:34:03,440
Guest: I have a Ubuntu box and the rest of the stuff is Win 2K, XP and Vista.

499
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:17,399
Guest: But, you know, I just I'm playing with computers all the time, whether it's swapping out hard drives out of laptops or building machines from scratch or for other people, I just it's something that relaxes me.

500
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:23,380
Guest: I have a pretty stressful job and it's that's that's, you know, it's really.

501
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,982
Scott: Nancy, I was way into, you know, fiddling with the computers themselves for for a long time.

502
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:31,856
Scott: And early on, it was like a big, you know, learning thing like.

503
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:36,360
Scott: that's how I learned a lot of the stuff I know is just by putting computers together, installing operating systems.

504
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:39,780
Rym: I mean, you used to run Jentu and unlike me, you actually kept part of job today.

505
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:40,464
Scott: Yeah.

506
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:42,320
Scott: And that helped me learn a lot.

507
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,440
Scott: But then I sort of reached a point where I wasn't learning anymore.

508
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:51,480
Scott: And it was just, you know, it's I wanted to use the computer to do things I didn't want to.

509
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,684
Scott: You know, I found that I was spending all my time working for the computer and the computer wasn't working for me.

510
00:34:56,744 --> 00:35:04,320
Scott: So that's why now it's just like install Ubuntu or install whatever the default OS is, use the default settings and just get work done.

511
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,823
Scott: You know, so.

512
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,040
Rym: But you got to got to tweak your kernel.

513
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,359
Rym: The kernel's got to be tweaked.

514
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,103
Scott: No, it doesn't.

515
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:13,060
Guest: And that's more software than hardware.

516
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,720
Guest: You know, I just built a couple of FreeNAS servers and that that has been a lot of fun.

517
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,579
Guest: FreeNAS is a lot of fun to play with.

518
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:24,180
Guest: And, you know, one of them's a four terabyte server.

519
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:26,479
Guest: And I did a. I did a video about that.

520
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:45,244
Guest: And the funny thing as far as video killing podcasting, I think I have over 2,000 views on that video, whereas the average, you know, number of listeners for, say, the over 40 gamer podcasts that I was doing for a while, you know, I was getting 70 or 80 a month on that solo show.

521
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,639
Guest: So video is much more powerful.

522
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,104
Guest: No, it isn't.

523
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:53,961
Guest: And Friday Night Party Line's numbers are considerably, well, substantially higher.

524
00:35:53,982 --> 00:36:02,000
Rym: I mean, I think the issue is with video, like the main thing we want to do with video is it seems like a lot of people just don't understand podcasting.

525
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:11,945
Rym: Even to this day, the vast majority of people I talk to have never heard of the word of no idea what it is that they and even if they own an iPod, they just like, oh, I don't know, is that some iTunes thing?

526
00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:15,285
Scott: It's like a podcasting button in iTunes, but they don't notice it somehow.

527
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:16,380
Rym: They don't even know it's there.

528
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,659
Rym: Never, never even cross their mind to click on it.

529
00:36:19,181 --> 00:36:23,060
Rym: So we want to make videos that kind of point out, hey, there's podcast.

530
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:24,959
Scott: We should definitely do a how-to podcast video.

531
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,839
Rym: You all commute.

532
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,338
Guest: Kevin Rose did one three years ago.

533
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,000
Guest: I mean, that helped me get into this show and get into this stuff.

534
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:38,980
Guest: I mean, the folks over at Revision3 have done a lot of the things that you're talking about and they're making a go of it.

535
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,411
Guest: But I have a feeling that their numbers on some of their shows are probably lower than GeekNights.

536
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,404
Scott: Well, some of it, yeah.

537
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:55,122
Scott: I mean, you know, some of the Revision3 shows, I mean, I know who Revision3 is just from listening, you know, to to Twit and formerly reading Dig and all that stuff.

538
00:36:55,202 --> 00:36:58,320
Scott: But, you know, I only know about some of their biggest shows.

539
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,351
Scott: I mean, they have a lot of shows on there and most of them, I think most people just never heard of them.

540
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:07,452
Guest: If you can't tie advertising to it, though, it's it's it's not.

541
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:13,340
Guest: it's hard to sustain with the degree of quality that you'll need to compete with other things that are happening.

542
00:37:14,021 --> 00:37:19,122
Guest: There are so many people that do podcasting and maybe do one or two shows and then then fade away.

543
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:25,320
Guest: But the number of good, consistent podcasts, I think, is actually shrinking.

544
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,059
Rym: I would have to agree.

545
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,719
Rym: I mean, I have an added new podcast to my repertoire and in a long time and I have it's not like I've stopped looking.

546
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:40,120
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, sort of what I've had is I sort of found enough podcasts to sort of fill my daily routine.

547
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:46,100
Scott: So it's like, you know, I added recently that the John C. Dvorak's like Tech Five, you know, it's very short.

548
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,386
Scott: So I can just sort of listen to it in the morning really quickly, like I'm driving to the train station.

549
00:37:50,427 --> 00:37:51,378
Scott: I can listen to the whole thing.

550
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,399
Guest: Well, that's what Grammar Girl does, too.

551
00:37:53,780 --> 00:38:06,400
Guest: And Grammar Girl has that whole company of all, you know, legal lad and sales guy and all of these six minute podcasts that that have advertising in it, but give you a nugget of value in that six minutes.

552
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,600
Scott: Onion Radio News, I think, was the first podcast to really master that format.

553
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:13,433
Scott: Mm hmm.

554
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:14,060
Scott: All right.

555
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:18,660
Scott: So you said you're like primary geekery is like computer hardware, right?

556
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,160
Scott: But you weren't like born with a CPU hanging out of your mouth or anything.

557
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,538
Scott: So how did you like get into that?

558
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,460
Guest: Well, it just goes back to the beginning.

559
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,204
Guest: I'm old.

560
00:38:27,225 --> 00:38:29,179
Guest: I'm two years old.

561
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:32,597
Guest: And, you know, so I mean, I played with Trash 80s.

562
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,683
Guest: I played with.

563
00:38:33,704 --> 00:38:36,380
Guest: I had a Timex Sinclair computer.

564
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:39,140
Guest: I played with them since they became popular.

565
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,059
Guest: I still have my original IBM XT.

566
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:43,700
Scott: XTs are good for typing.

567
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:52,360
Guest: When you when you just play with something as a hobby for more than 20 years, you just learn really.

568
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,340
Guest: I mean, yeah, I'm a lawyer.

569
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,339
Guest: I'm not I'm not a computer guy.

570
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:55,701
Scott: Yeah.

571
00:38:55,721 --> 00:39:01,779
Scott: I was just about to say, like, you know, with such an interesting computers, you ended up, though, as the lawyer, like how did did you did you?

572
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,000
Guest: Well, that's that's a fair question.

573
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,860
Scott: I you know, I mean, would you rather be a computer guy?

574
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:12,829
Guest: Oh, that's such that's I don't know.

575
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:19,749
Guest: I think that I'd rather do what you would rather do and be sort of independently wealthy and then do whatever it's like that day.

576
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,790
Scott: Well, you have enough money to feed both of us.

577
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,597
Scott: So let's both quit.

578
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:23,970
Scott: And we'll get on that.

579
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:28,075
Rym: Well, there was that period about a year ago when I was thinking about just giving up on I.T.

580
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:28,825
Rym: going to law school.

581
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:30,277
Scott: It's true.

582
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,350
Rym: Going the opposite direction.

583
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,890
Rym: Luckily, but I mean, that was all before.

584
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,887
Rym: I guess I was so disillusioned with I.T.

585
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,970
Rym: just because I had a pretty crappy job and I was making, you know, mediocre money.

586
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,670
Rym: And then suddenly now stock market gigantic.

587
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,690
Rym: Like I actually just got a fifteen thousand dollar raise out of the blue last week.

588
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,469
Rym: Like my boss said, hey, you want fifteen thousand more dollars?

589
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:55,110
Rym: And I was like, yeah, I think I'm going to stick around this place a while.

590
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,249
Rym: So I think I've given up on my lawyer dreams.

591
00:39:58,752 --> 00:40:00,890
Guest: Well, you know, you're probably better off for it.

592
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,310
Guest: Law is extremely competitive.

593
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,990
Guest: I mean, my first seven years of practice, I didn't enjoy it at all.

594
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:08,170
Guest: And it was very, very difficult.

595
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:16,530
Guest: And then through a series of circumstances and through some things that I was involved in, I ended up at my current place.

596
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:18,548
Guest: And I like that a lot.

597
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,748
Guest: And it's been very rewarding, too.

598
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,983
Scott: So do you have any hobbies that, like, aren't geeky?

599
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:31,729
Scott: or I mean, is it just pretty much that we would argue that any any hobby becomes geeky?

600
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:32,551
Scott: Exactly.

601
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:37,229
Scott: Like if you told me that you liked, you know, say, snowboarding, I'd say, well, you're a snowboarding geek, but, you know.

602
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:37,974
Rym: Well, maybe not.

603
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:40,930
Rym: Maybe I've never seen a snowboarder actually snowboarding.

604
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:41,920
Scott: So that's yeah.

605
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:47,790
Scott: But do you have any hobbies that aren't, you know, popularly considered to be geek hobbies for a while?

606
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,268
Guest: I was a serial hobbyist.

607
00:40:49,972 --> 00:40:53,470
Guest: I would go from one thing to the next to flying lessons.

608
00:40:54,492 --> 00:40:58,370
Guest: I took oil painting lessons, drawing.

609
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,909
Guest: I still do a little pencil drawing.

610
00:41:01,812 --> 00:41:10,965
Guest: I did collecting various things from stamps to coins to, you know, I don't even remember all the things now.

611
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:21,690
Guest: From Lego to robot building to I'm just sort of looking around now for the remnants, the vestiges of these hobbies.

612
00:41:22,651 --> 00:41:30,389
Guest: And eventually my work got so time consuming that I really only had time for one or two.

613
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,170
Guest: So I still have the sports car and I still have all my computers.

614
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:44,513
Guest: But podcasting is probably, if you can call that a hobby, the only other thing that I do.

615
00:41:44,757 --> 00:41:45,366
Guest: But that's geeky.

616
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,513
Scott: Yeah, I guess.

617
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,510
Scott: My friend's dad is a lot like that.

618
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,250
Scott: Like he would go and buy a bowling ball and then he would stop bowling.

619
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,129
Scott: He would bowl a whole bunch and then he would stop.

620
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,750
Scott: And then he would yeah.

621
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,290
Scott: Then he would go and buy something else and do that.

622
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,610
Scott: Like he bought a camera and he'd be taking pictures like crazy and then he would stop.

623
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:07,070
Guest: And I don't know, it's all part of discovering what you like to do.

624
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:12,870
Guest: I mean, when we on Friday night party line, we make fun of the idea of what what is it?

625
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:13,473
Guest: that's really fun.

626
00:42:13,513 --> 00:42:17,010
Guest: If you're a happy person, like, you know, Rym is a happy person.

627
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:22,290
Guest: You can't make the guy unhappy, really, from what we see, at least in the audience.

628
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:22,791
Guest: I don't know.

629
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:26,210
Guest: Maybe he cries himself to sleep every night, but on the inside, maybe.

630
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:27,432
Rym: Yeah.

631
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:32,152
Rym: As people are in, the crew can say it's actually scarier in real life than on the show.

632
00:42:32,212 --> 00:42:34,269
Rym: I'm much less cynical in the real world.

633
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:40,549
Guest: So, you know, but there are other people, Scott and me, who are not like that.

634
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:49,690
Guest: And so you spend your life searching for something that is enjoyable, that you can put your time in and get something that's back, that's rewarding.

635
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,638
Scott: I don't need to search.

636
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:51,770
Scott: I just can't get.

637
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:55,810
Guest: Well, but it becomes a search after a while.

638
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:02,670
Guest: I mean, you remind me of myself from when I was younger, except I had a girlfriend.

639
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:03,434
Rym: I'm sorry.

640
00:43:04,604 --> 00:43:05,229
Scott: What do you want from me?

641
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:09,310
Guest: No, it's your rigid thinking, Scott.

642
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,590
Guest: You have so much rigidity in your mind and it stops you from doing things like dating.

643
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:16,032
Guest: That's all.

644
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:22,050
Scott: Well, you know, I don't think rigidity in my mind to stop me from dating so much as lack of free time.

645
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,489
Rym: Lack of rigidity in other places?

646
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,909
Scott: No, but I have plenty of rigidity in many places.

647
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:42,950
Scott: But I do recognize that there are a lot of things where, like, I come up with like an obvious answer to my problem and then I sort of refuse to execute on that because I feel like it's cheating or I feel like it's sort of wrong.

648
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:43,834
Rym: You know, you're like.

649
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:50,770
Rym: you're like what you're like me when I was a kid and I play video games and I'd run into a boss and it'd be super hard and I couldn't beat him.

650
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:51,689
Rym: Like, it'd be really difficult.

651
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:58,429
Rym: But then there'd always be like I'd see the really cheap way to beat the boss, like, oh, if I just go around the back and grenade and then he'll die.

652
00:43:58,853 --> 00:44:00,670
Rym: And I remember never wanting to do that.

653
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,289
Rym: And as a result, I never beat video games.

654
00:44:02,772 --> 00:44:05,930
Rym: And then I found out later that all these games kind of expected you to do that.

655
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,709
Rym: And that was, in fact, the only way to beat those bosses.

656
00:44:09,252 --> 00:44:09,518
Scott: Yeah.

657
00:44:09,538 --> 00:44:10,049
Scott: Yeah.

658
00:44:11,873 --> 00:44:12,120
Scott: Yeah.

659
00:44:12,305 --> 00:44:12,490
Scott: Yeah.

660
00:44:13,532 --> 00:44:13,654
Guest: Yeah.

661
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:14,750
Guest: All right.

662
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,110
Scott: So you are you're you're a fancy lawyer.

663
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,034
Scott: I don't even know what.

664
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:22,650
Scott: actually, you know, there's a lot of lawyers who listen and talk in the forums and are on Friday night party line.

665
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,669
Rym: Did you forget which ones which?

666
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:29,648
Scott: No, no, I just it's like I know what kind of lawyer all the other lawyers are, but I don't know what kind of lawyer you are.

667
00:44:30,391 --> 00:44:35,522
Guest: See, I can't really go into that because I do want to keep this Internet schizophrenia going.

668
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:36,010
Scott: That's fine.

669
00:44:36,832 --> 00:44:39,630
Guest: And I the type of law that I do is highly specialized.

670
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:42,470
Guest: So if I go into it at all, I'd be easily spotted.

671
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:43,112
Scott: That's fine.

672
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:49,970
Scott: And that really is an exciting area of law, like intellectual property, or is it or is it lame to normal people?

673
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,810
Guest: I'm not a litigator.

674
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:53,750
Guest: I started out doing commercial litigation.

675
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:54,729
Guest: I can talk about that.

676
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:58,410
Guest: I hated it because basically it's combative all the time.

677
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:04,830
Guest: You know, four thirty in a Friday afternoon, motions are coming in over the fax machine designed to ruin your weekend.

678
00:45:06,993 --> 00:45:09,889
Scott: Are you at least sending out to ruin other people's weekends at the same time?

679
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:11,010
Guest: Oh, yeah, sure.

680
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:11,541
Guest: Yeah, yeah.

681
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,230
Guest: And doing all kinds of things.

682
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,929
Guest: And it's give and take, but I don't want that.

683
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:20,850
Guest: I'm not the kind of lawyer that wants to fight.

684
00:45:22,714 --> 00:45:24,690
Guest: So, you know, I'd rather have everybody agree.

685
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,889
Guest: And so litigation is not for me.

686
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:35,950
Scott: Well, I mean, this sort of like this, I don't know, sort of cliche, you know, like, oh, lawyers, they're like the bane of existence.

687
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,890
Scott: You know, they make the world miserable.

688
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:45,230
Scott: So being a lawyer, I guess, is it, you know, do you sort of feel that like, you know, I'm you're evil or what?

689
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,369
Guest: Well, it's it's my evil.

690
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:48,106
Rym: Yeah.

691
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:49,720
Rym: OK.

692
00:45:51,513 --> 00:45:56,890
Scott: Well, I mean, it's sort of like, you know, it's like my uncle's a dentist.

693
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,290
Scott: So it's sort of like people dread, you know, the dentist.

694
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,230
Scott: So it's sort of, you know, he doesn't care.

695
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:05,210
Scott: But other other, you know, there's there is a high rate of like suicide among dentists.

696
00:46:05,331 --> 00:46:06,588
Scott: And that has something to do with it.

697
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:14,090
Scott: So I was wondering if lawyer, you know, what kind of feelings you had being in a, you know, a member of a somewhat despised profession?

698
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,530
Guest: Yeah, I mean, you get that a lot and you just have to go with it.

699
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:27,769
Guest: I mean, the idea, the joke about the post office coming out with a commemorative stamp for lawyers, but they had to discontinue it because people couldn't figure out which side of the stamp to spit on.

700
00:46:29,396 --> 00:46:30,169
Scott: I never heard that one.

701
00:46:30,632 --> 00:46:33,810
Guest: You get you get you get that.

702
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,630
Guest: But, you know, what I do is helping people.

703
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,430
Guest: It's it's not combative.

704
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,090
Guest: So I don't I don't internalize that.

705
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:46,090
Guest: And I can always blame the plaintiff's lawyers for being the real cause of the problem.

706
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:47,109
Guest: But you know what?

707
00:46:47,835 --> 00:46:48,610
Guest: It's like an onion.

708
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:51,810
Guest: If you peel that back, it's not really the plaintiff's lawyers.

709
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:52,649
Guest: They're the guns.

710
00:46:53,530 --> 00:47:07,244
Guest: And it's the people that are that are unhappy, that are willing to sue and go through the incredible inconvenience and hassle that a lawsuit is just to have vengeance or make money or what have you.

711
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:25,430
Scott: So, you know, I'm sort of speaking for myself here, but it really feels like lately, especially with all the, you know, the the ways law and technology have been interacting, that, you know, law has become more important for a lot of people in their everyday lives.

712
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:28,050
Scott: But it's also, you know, incredibly complicated.

713
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:32,389
Scott: You have to go to school for years and years to even, you know, understand it.

714
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:39,989
Scott: And sort of in a situation where, you know, every day people have like lots of questions they want to ask lawyers.

715
00:47:40,572 --> 00:47:44,449
Scott: But in order to get an answer, you have to pay someone like it's not it's not free.

716
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,090
Guest: Right.

717
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:54,270
Scott: So it seems like people, they want to follow the law or know it, but it's not something they can understand.

718
00:47:54,852 --> 00:48:01,390
Scott: And it's like it really feels like you have to if you don't have a lot of money, you can't even know what the law is to follow it.

719
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:04,029
Scott: Do you get what I'm saying?

720
00:48:05,331 --> 00:48:12,169
Guest: I guess, but most people have a working knowledge of the daily laws that they have to not violate to stay out of jail.

721
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:13,474
Scott: Yeah, but I'm talking about

722
00:48:13,615 --> 00:48:30,649
Rym: actually, I would argue that maybe it's just geeks and technology people, but a lot of the things that I do on a daily basis get very close to gray areas of the law where I'm not sure anymore, because a lot of laws that relate to these areas just aren't clear.

723
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,970
Rym: And even our company lawyers are like, I don't know, I just don't know.

724
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,410
Rym: And there's there's not enough body of case law to kind of have a precedent or anything.

725
00:48:39,531 --> 00:48:41,070
Rym: And the judges don't understand.

726
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,250
Rym: And there's no way in hell a jury's going to understand.

727
00:48:44,232 --> 00:48:47,270
Rym: And I mean, I guess I should be the one who's out there as the expert witness.

728
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:49,730
Rym: But then all I'm doing is explaining the technology.

729
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:54,769
Rym: And then the lawyer still has to tell me what I like, how to translate what I just said into what the law says.

730
00:48:55,151 --> 00:49:01,130
Scott: If you haven't guessed, I'm pretty much taking advantage of the fact that you're a lawyer and you're on the show to save myself some money.

731
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:06,330
Rym: So you're planning to to possibly break some laws, apparently?

732
00:49:06,512 --> 00:49:06,770
Scott: I don't know.

733
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:10,589
Scott: Is it is it against the law for me to just if you just answer law questions for me?

734
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:17,788
Guest: Well, I'm not licensed in New York state, so I can't give you legal advice on New York law.

735
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:21,050
Guest: But we can talk about hypothetically and generally speaking.

736
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,088
Scott: That's good enough.

737
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,287
Rym: So how do you feel about we do it?

738
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:25,170
Rym: I want to derail.

739
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,270
Rym: We won't go on too long about this.

740
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:31,670
Rym: But there's a story recently about a guy who is taking photographs and he wasn't violating any laws.

741
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:32,969
Rym: He was taking them in a public place.

742
00:49:33,353 --> 00:49:34,810
Rym: But the police harassed him.

743
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:37,610
Rym: I think they eventually arrested him and all this business.

744
00:49:38,251 --> 00:49:42,870
Rym: And in the end, it was determined that he was not violating a single law.

745
00:49:43,332 --> 00:49:56,970
Rym: And yet because the police neither the police nor him nor anyone involved until it got to court even knew the law or knew that whether or not there was even a law that covered the situation, that this person could be arrested for committing absolutely no crime.

746
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:59,270
Rym: And there was no even evidence that he committed a crime.

747
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:01,489
Guest: That's not surprising to me at all.

748
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:01,981
Rym: Yeah.

749
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:03,490
Rym: And I don't know.

750
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,270
Rym: I don't really have a question.

751
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,169
Rym: What do we do about that?

752
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:11,070
Rym: Because technology is making it more easy to run into these situations like with photography.

753
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:14,490
Rym: How many pictures are taken in public constantly?

754
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:21,130
Rym: And it seems like no police officer in this country understands that it's legal to take a picture from public place as far as I'm aware.

755
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:21,789
Rym: And I'm not a lawyer.

756
00:50:22,714 --> 00:50:23,930
Guest: You guys talked about this, right?

757
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:27,370
Guest: You mentioned the standard of reasonable expectation of privacy.

758
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:28,248
Guest: Someone said that.

759
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,030
Rym: Yeah, that's one of my hot buttons.

760
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,140
Rym: So it's one thing I actually did.

761
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,949
Rym: as much research as a non-lawyer can do.

762
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:38,089
Guest: You know, Ray from Friday Night Party Line is an expert on this area of law.

763
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:40,269
Guest: He is nationally known on this point.

764
00:50:40,812 --> 00:50:45,170
Guest: But basically it is that, that reasonable expectation of privacy.

765
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:50,309
Guest: But at the same time, the police have immense power and they can always arrest you.

766
00:50:50,851 --> 00:50:54,070
Guest: Just because you haven't actually broken the law, that'll get figured out later.

767
00:50:54,516 --> 00:50:54,725
Guest: Maybe.

768
00:50:55,390 --> 00:51:02,110
Guest: And if you have perfect faith in the system and then you don't use a lawyer to defend yourself, you're probably going to get convicted.

769
00:51:03,971 --> 00:51:08,990
Guest: Really it's a power system, not so much a system of justice.

770
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:16,310
Guest: It's, so, you know, some of the stories you've told, Rym, about how you've pushed the envelope with police officers.

771
00:51:17,312 --> 00:51:22,070
Guest: I would cringe when I heard it because you were counting on your rights to be upheld.

772
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:28,708
Guest: And they're really not, it's just, it's almost happenstance if that's actually how it's going to work out.

773
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:41,170
Rym: Yeah, sadly I've gotten to the point now where I'm of the mind that I should carry surveillance on me at all times so that if I have an interaction, let's say, with the police, there's some sort of external record of it to vindicate me in the future.

774
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:47,610
Guest: Well, often they are recorded themselves and the fastest way to get arrested is to start videotaping a police officer.

775
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,928
Guest: And in fact, that might be a good way to get tased too.

776
00:51:52,813 --> 00:51:54,330
Scott: Even though it's perfectly okay.

777
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:58,910
Scott: I mean, where would Rodney King be if we weren't allowed to videotape police officers?

778
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:08,370
Guest: But yeah, we're supposed to have this, the First Amendment and everything else, so theoretically you should be able to, but in some states it's not legal to do that.

779
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:17,802
Scott: Are there any particular things in law that are like really, like they really bother you a lot?

780
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,810
Rym: I mean, you can avoid talking about things that might reveal your secret identity.

781
00:52:24,031 --> 00:52:34,869
Guest: And I wish I didn't have to do the secret identity thing, but you know, if you work for a place that might care and I go out of my way to try to do what you do, Scott, and do something that would embarrass me.

782
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,129
Guest: But I'm a human being and I might make a mistake.

783
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:42,030
Guest: So I have the pseudonym as sort of an extra layer of protection.

784
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:46,530
Guest: That way I can have fun, you know, this being one of the few things I consider fun in life.

785
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:54,667
Guest: But yeah, the things that bug me, I mean, the whole copyright thing is really hard to understand.

786
00:52:55,731 --> 00:53:12,648
Guest: This mux tape thing that's out now where you can upload your songs, create a mix and have other people listen to them, I'm waiting for that to just blow up because basically you could buy a new CD, put it up track by track and that, and then anybody in the world could listen to that CD.

787
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:13,969
Guest: Why would they buy it?

788
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:17,570
Guest: You're just using the internet as a giant hard drive for everybody to listen to.

789
00:53:17,771 --> 00:53:18,810
Guest: They don't have to download it.

790
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,125
Guest: They can listen to it when they want to.

791
00:53:21,272 --> 00:53:22,669
Guest: So that's going to go down.

792
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:23,688
Guest: They're going to attack that.

793
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:35,749
Guest: The RIAA has, is, you know, some of the things they want to put in place in terms of federal laws, they want to have a copyright czar who's on par with the war on drugs czar.

794
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:37,970
Guest: I mean, that's crazy.

795
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:45,428
Guest: They want to break down people's houses and see if you happen to copy an old video tape from 10 years ago.

796
00:53:45,830 --> 00:54:02,748
Rym: This is why I've actually been very interested in, and I've asked a lot of people about how to do this before because I really want to be one of those expert witnesses for all these cases because I think I would enjoy it because I like to expound upon things that might make other people angry.

797
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:07,650
Guest: Unless you like being sodomized by lawyers because that's what they do to expert witnesses.

798
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:18,068
Guest: You have to be, I mean, the expert witnesses you see on TV, well, if it's a big enough case, they'll hire private investigators to follow you around to try to dig up details in your personal life.

799
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:22,210
Guest: They'll look at everything you've ever said in public or in private.

800
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:27,650
Guest: Masturbation episode of GeekNights, exhibit A in your testimony after you're done.

801
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:30,390
Scott: But how is that relevant to my computer knowledge?

802
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:32,490
Rym: Well, what if it's a case about pedophiles or something?

803
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:34,430
Scott: I'm not going to testify in a pedophile case.

804
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:36,610
Rym: But that's the most common case on the internet.

805
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,300
Rym: It's either that or it's copyright.

806
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,049
Scott: I guess.

807
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:44,508
Guest: So they would have a field day with you.

808
00:54:46,373 --> 00:54:49,070
Scott: No, that's that's the kind of thing that bothers me is sort of like this.

809
00:54:49,512 --> 00:54:53,405
Scott: You know, why are they attacking my character when I'm just there to tell them how computers work?

810
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,152
Scott: You know, it's like.

811
00:54:54,173 --> 00:54:55,823
Scott: if I know computers work, what does it matter?

812
00:54:55,884 --> 00:54:58,069
Scott: if I'm you know, what else is true about me?

813
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:16,389
Rym: Well, my real interest is that, you know, you brought up the RIAA and copyright, but as a technology professional and ignoring the legal aspect of it, from everything I've read about these cases, they've never presented technological evidence that was even close to being useful ever in any of these RIAA cases.

814
00:55:16,792 --> 00:55:17,849
Guest: It's what they're talking about.

815
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:18,987
Guest: So they can fudge it.

816
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:25,944
Guest: If you can get in a courtroom and most of these are small state courtrooms and state court, you know, you don't want to be there.

817
00:55:26,005 --> 00:55:26,710
Guest: if you don't have to.

818
00:55:28,493 --> 00:55:31,510
Guest: And you're not going to have the high level of expertise that you will in federal court.

819
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:33,769
Rym: And I feel like this is a big problem.

820
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:45,107
Rym: I feel like if it like, in addition to having a jury of your peers, you should have the right to at least have an expert witness who understands the issue at hand in any court case.

821
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:54,210
Scott: I mean, like, you know, you have a jury, but if the case is about, you know, computers and no one on the jury has ever used a computer, how are they?

822
00:55:54,812 --> 00:55:56,149
Scott: I mean, how are they my peers?

823
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:57,361
Scott: They're not.

824
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:00,310
Guest: It's just that's just jargon.

825
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,810
Guest: There's no such thing as peers, but they're going to, you know, Rym's on trial.

826
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:11,830
Guest: They're going to go out and find people, you know, 12 people with IQs of 140 plus who have technology backgrounds.

827
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:12,302
Guest: Wrong.

828
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:15,870
Guest: They're going to find people who can't figure out how to get out of jury duty.

829
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,950
Rym: The sad thing is I wanted to serve on jury.

830
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:22,450
Rym: Every time I'm called, I really want to serve on the jury and I do everything right.

831
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:25,090
Rym: And I'm there and I'm always immediately dismissed.

832
00:56:25,971 --> 00:56:29,149
Rym: As soon as they like, look at me, they kick me out and I'm done.

833
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:32,999
Scott: It's just no good.

834
00:56:33,442 --> 00:56:35,632
Rym: In fact, when I worked at the hospital, I was told.

835
00:56:35,853 --> 00:56:38,200
Rym: basically I said, yeah, I'm a technology professional for a hospital.

836
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,080
Rym: They said, oh, you don't have to serve on a jury.

837
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:41,100
Rym: And they let me go.

838
00:56:44,808 --> 00:56:45,056
Scott: Oh, well.

839
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:46,369
Scott: Yeah.

840
00:56:47,486 --> 00:56:47,758
Scott: Let's see.

841
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,980
Scott: Do I have any other lawyer-y questions?

842
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,379
Scott: Well, it is, you know, it's like there's a whole.

843
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,420
Scott: It's like, I kind of.

844
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:00,340
Rym: So what's the legal distinction between flotsam and jetsam if we're in international waters?

845
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:04,280
Guest: I'm not a maritime lawyer.

846
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:10,738
Guest: You should have Carney on, though, because his perspective as a prosecutor is different than mine.

847
00:57:11,547 --> 00:57:12,080
Scott: Maybe we will.

848
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,299
Scott: It could be pretty cool.

849
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:15,862
Scott: But yeah, it's like.

850
00:57:15,943 --> 00:57:21,100
Scott: lately I've actually run into like a few sort of like situations where it's kind of like I need a lawyer.

851
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:26,560
Scott: Like we sort of want to officially make like a business like front row crew studios or something.

852
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:29,480
Scott: And we also kind of want to like buy a house.

853
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:32,600
Scott: But since there's a whole bunch of us, we might need like a real estate lawyer.

854
00:57:33,361 --> 00:57:36,700
Scott: You know, it's like, how do I like find a lawyer?

855
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,419
Scott: How do I know I'm not getting ripped off?

856
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,179
Scott: How do I, you know, I don't know how to do any of those things.

857
00:57:42,303 --> 00:57:44,700
Guest: The Bar Association will probably have a referral service.

858
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,719
Guest: At the very least, you can try that.

859
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:52,520
Guest: Talking to lawyers who know other lawyers is a very good way to find people.

860
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,859
Guest: You guys do like to do a lot of stuff yourself.

861
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,820
Guest: And they're, you know, certainly with setting up an LLC, you can probably do that yourself.

862
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:04,580
Guest: You can learn a lot just by going to the website for the Secretary of State.

863
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,400
Guest: And it's not hard and it's not expensive.

864
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:14,717
Guest: I just set up an LLC that's going to own Friday Night Party Line and anything else that I do online now.

865
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,870
Rym: Because actually the worst thing is.

866
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:17,980
Rym: that's what I was thinking.

867
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,280
Rym: Like, all right, LLC, whatever.

868
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:28,300
Rym: And then we got advice from people who kept saying, no, you got to make a Delaware whatever thing and you got to do this and that and issue stock and blah, blah, blah.

869
00:58:28,762 --> 00:58:35,940
Rym: Then we run into the fact that with my job, I'm legally barred from having control over investments or owning stock or anything like that.

870
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:36,899
Rym: And there's all this trouble.

871
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,860
Guest: Business entities are very flexible.

872
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:57,900
Guest: If it turned out that you do your LLC just for tax purposes and then later if someone wants to buy it or they want to invest in it and they're out of state and there's SEC issues, you can convert it into another entity.

873
00:58:59,062 --> 00:59:01,800
Guest: There are many, many things you can do and they're all very flexible.

874
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,500
Guest: So start out with what you can do now.

875
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:17,148
Guest: Set up an LLC, get a tax ID number, get a business account, get a PayPal business account and then you're good to go for pretty much anything for the next few years unless somebody is going to pay you $1.75 billion like CBS did for CNET.

876
00:59:21,301 --> 00:59:26,240
Scott: I mean, if I had $1.75 billion, I would probably buy like a sports team, right?

877
00:59:26,684 --> 00:59:27,580
Scott: Why would you buy CNET?

878
00:59:28,989 --> 00:59:29,438
Scott: I don't get it.

879
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,640
Rym: Depends on the sports team.

880
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,040
Scott: It does.

881
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:32,360
Guest: Why is CBS bought CNET?

882
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:33,239
Guest: Because they're afraid.

883
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:38,460
Guest: All of the newspapers in the world are declining.

884
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:44,620
Guest: Nobody watches TV and when they do watch TV, they time shift it or they don't watch it at all anymore.

885
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,900
Guest: When you can watch anything you want at any time, you don't watch anything.

886
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:57,780
Rym: Well, I just feel like there's, I mean, this is a topic for a whole separate discussion, but I feel like in the next, God, I want to live a time frame.

887
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:04,720
Rym: I'd say within the next decade, definitely, there's going to be a rapid fundamental shift in the way media is presented and consumed.

888
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:09,500
Rym: I think it's going to, I think the ramifications are going to be far reaching and longterm and frightening to a lot of people.

889
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:17,600
Scott: I think we're definitely, you know, we're sort of climbing the roller coaster now and in a few years we're going to be going over the top and then it's downhill.

890
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:29,970
Guest: But CNET, according, you know, CBS looks at CNET and they say, okay, they're doing internet TV, they're doing IPTV, we'll buy them and then we'll have IPTV too.

891
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:32,408
Guest: But you know, are they doing it very well?

892
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,880
Guest: Do they really have that strong of a presence?

893
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,790
Guest: to what kind of credibility do they have?

894
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:37,450
Guest: I don't know.

895
01:00:37,591 --> 01:00:41,389
Scott: Well, they've got, they've got a name seen as a somewhat well known name.

896
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:42,970
Guest: They're well known.

897
01:00:43,351 --> 01:00:46,510
Guest: And if you pump a lot of money into it, I mean, they do things on a shoestring.

898
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:52,969
Guest: If you start pumping money into them, maybe, maybe that it'll, it'll do for CBS what CBS wants.

899
01:00:53,652 --> 01:01:09,750
Guest: And I think that ultimately when people can watch videos and TV shows literally anytime they want to, when they're on a bus, when they're, you know, and there, and there's no iPod necessary, you know, there's no storage media.

900
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:14,250
Guest: Everything is, anything you could ever want is immediately delivered instantaneously.

901
01:01:15,211 --> 01:01:18,990
Guest: Then, you know, that's probably what you're talking about, Scott.

902
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:19,320
Scott: Yeah.

903
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:21,309
Rym: Well, it gets, it gets really tricky then.

904
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:31,310
Rym: Cause I, I, I'm still debating if I want to write an article or something about it, but it's not just that you have to compete with the other media out there and even not even talk about monetization.

905
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,370
Scott: Oh yeah, this is a great idea.

906
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:33,209
Scott: I love this.

907
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:38,729
Rym: You can't, we also now, every piece of media we make has to compete with every piece of media that ever came out.

908
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:40,870
Rym: And I'm thinking of titling this little short book.

909
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,269
Rym: Like you can't compete with the past.

910
01:01:42,971 --> 01:01:50,200
Rym: I mean, there are more movies that have been made in the history of movie making that are probably worth for me watching to where.

911
01:01:50,341 --> 01:01:54,289
Rym: if movies were not made for the rest of my life, I don't think I would run out of movies to watch.

912
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:55,167
Scott: Yeah.

913
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:59,670
Scott: It's because back in, like when I was a kid, right, it, it pretty much, it costs something.

914
01:01:59,851 --> 01:02:02,569
Scott: It was difficult to get anything, especially if it was old.

915
01:02:02,831 --> 01:02:05,770
Scott: I mean, if something was old, it was incredibly difficult to get.

916
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,670
Scott: The only real stuff you can get was new stuff.

917
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:12,390
Scott: So it's pretty much if new stuff didn't come out, you really couldn't see anything.

918
01:02:12,652 --> 01:02:14,310
Scott: Cause you would just be sort of quiet.

919
01:02:14,812 --> 01:02:22,870
Scott: But now with you, not only do I have access to like all, everything that's new, but I have access to pretty much everything that has ever existed.

920
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:35,330
Scott: I mean, there's old TV shows, old comic books, old radio shows, old movies, old music, old everything, you know, for as long as humans have had recording technology, photographs, everything.

921
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:51,570
Scott: So there's so much that already exists and there is so much being created at any one time that the value of something new is significantly decreased because the supply of things in total is just so large that it's like, I don't need new things.

922
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:53,510
Scott: I can live on the old or the current.

923
01:02:53,831 --> 01:02:57,970
Rym: I mean, I haven't even finished reading Herodotus or Xenophon, let alone.

924
01:03:00,473 --> 01:03:08,190
Guest: You need an Amazon Kindle that lets you buy anything you ever wanted right now, anywhere you are, because it has the free wireless.

925
01:03:08,532 --> 01:03:15,090
Rym: Actually someone, I'm at this training for this gigantic like enterprise thing I bought for work and all week and down on wall street actually.

926
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:19,050
Rym: And three of the guys, they all have Kindles and I got to play with it for a while.

927
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,870
Rym: They had lent me to, you know, Hey, check this out.

928
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:21,185
Rym: It's cool.

929
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:26,682
Rym: And I'm probably going to buy one as soon as like the next revision comes out, like revision two.

930
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:28,030
Scott: Yeah, I definitely, yeah.

931
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,388
Scott: If there's a revision two of the Kindle, I might go for it.

932
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:35,048
Guest: But yes, cause how many times have you wanted to book and not been able to get your hands on one here?

933
01:03:35,352 --> 01:03:37,470
Guest: You know, when you guys are talking about the Prince of Nothing, oh, okay.

934
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,650
Guest: Touch three buttons and I have the copy.

935
01:03:40,431 --> 01:03:41,550
Scott: I think it's relevant to bring up.

936
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:46,810
Scott: Remember in the Prince of Nothing episode, I talked about, you know, I was thinking of setting up an Amazon Associates thing, right?

937
01:03:46,872 --> 01:03:46,938
Rym: Yup.

938
01:03:47,531 --> 01:03:48,088
Scott: Well, I did.

939
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:52,310
Scott: And you know, all the links to the three Prince of Nothing books were Associates links.

940
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:57,230
Scott: And you know, I'm not, you know, I don't want to like, you know, I'm fully disclosing here.

941
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:59,149
Scott: We made a lot of money from that.

942
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:03,369
Scott: Like a lot, like I get paid the Libsyn bill and then more so.

943
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:07,947
Scott: And like if we sell one Kindle through Associates, we get like $40 per Kindle.

944
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:09,350
Scott: It's like ludicrous.

945
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:17,850
Scott: And I sort of don't feel bad doing that because it's like, you know, you people who click on those links and buy products are not paying anymore.

946
01:04:18,394 --> 01:04:19,770
Scott: It's just we're basically taking money.

947
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:21,870
Scott: Amazon would have had an Amazon pocket.

948
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:31,170
Rym: The only reason it becomes, it would become bad would be if we started purposefully talking about things we wouldn't otherwise talk about and hyping them up just to get the link.

949
01:04:31,331 --> 01:04:39,889
Scott: Yeah, I'm not, I'm not going to hype up Kindles just because I'll make $40 off of them, you know, even though, you know, it is somewhat enticing, but there's no way that's going to happen.

950
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,130
Scott: But yeah.

951
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:45,069
Guest: I reviewed HGTV on my blog and I got mad hits on it.

952
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:48,390
Guest: If I would have done that, I would probably have made thousands of dollars.

953
01:04:48,990 --> 01:05:01,841
Scott: And I started looking around and there's actually a lot of websites have like these Associates programs, like Newegg has one, Right Stuff has one, Fun Again, which sells board games, has one, you know, I don't

954
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:03,710
Rym: think I'd go with Right Stuff because, well,

955
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:04,368
Scott: no, we can go to Amazon.

956
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:10,589
Rym: But I'm saying even with the whole, even with Amazon, when DVDs, I feel like Netflix is killing the anime DVD.

957
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:12,466
Scott: Maybe Netflix has a thingy.

958
01:05:13,634 --> 01:05:13,827
Scott: Who knows?

959
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,030
Rym: Everyone already has Netflix.

960
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:16,206
Scott: I know, I know, I know.

961
01:05:16,752 --> 01:05:19,149
Guest: But if you produce content, you should make money on it.

962
01:05:19,891 --> 01:05:26,197
Rym: Yeah, but it's tricky because like the anime industry is a good example of this where, you know, you can't compete with the past.

963
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:33,310
Rym: and so much anime is being released in the US and as someone aptly put it, they try to make all their money selling DVDs.

964
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:37,170
Rym: But that's like the Wheel of Fortune trying to make money off of selling DVDs.

965
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:39,590
Rym: Like it's this disposable medium.

966
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:46,410
Rym: These are shows that air once a week and like everyone watches them and then they forget about them and no one watches them again.

967
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:55,090
Rym: They're like these serial million episode monstrosities and they make a ton of money in Japan with TV advertising and, you know, merchandising and all that stuff.

968
01:05:55,592 --> 01:05:57,339
Rym: But in the US, they've got this market of.

969
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,551
Rym: they try to sell these DVDs and no one buys them.

970
01:06:01,173 --> 01:06:09,530
Rym: and as huge anime fan as I am, I really never buy anime DVDs and there's no reason to because I can rent them perfectly legally.

971
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:10,599
Rym: I don't even need to steal them.

972
01:06:13,115 --> 01:06:14,890
Rym: But as a result, the anime industry is collapsing.

973
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:17,888
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of sad.

974
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:22,210
Scott: All right, it's getting a little... Do you want to end it here?

975
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,269
Scott: Do you got anything else?

976
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:24,490
Rym: I guess we could wrap it up.

977
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:25,589
Rym: We've gone on a good hour.

978
01:06:26,072 --> 01:06:26,570
Scott: No, that's good.

979
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:27,290
Scott: I can go eat dinner.

980
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:31,110
Scott: So, Thade, is there anything like you particularly want to like promote?

981
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,290
Scott: Anything you want to, you know, tell people?

982
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:41,590
Guest: Oh, just Friday Night Party line because, you know, you guys have been a part of it and I hope that you'll continue to be a part of it as we really ramp things up in the next few months.

983
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:48,410
Guest: I don't want to go through the list of people that we've asked to be guests, but some of them have been on Oprah.

984
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:52,949
Scott: So it's not Tom Cruise, is it?

985
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:57,130
Guest: No, that would be interesting.

986
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:09,190
Guest: But I mean, the plan for Friday Night Party line is to monetize it to an extent only really to satisfy my own hobbyist interests of being able to afford to get high-end guests.

987
01:07:10,052 --> 01:07:11,842
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I have the opposite take of like.

988
01:07:11,882 --> 01:07:19,610
Rym: I haven't been on it nearly as often as Scott, but I always want to because I would... Making money or whatever, it's just really fun to be on that show.

989
01:07:20,513 --> 01:07:22,230
Rym: It's a lot more enjoyable than doing GeekNights.

990
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,389
Scott: That's the reason I do it.

991
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:27,090
Scott: I look at that topic list and I'm like, oh, man, I got something to say about that.

992
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:27,989
Scott: Everyone's going to hear it.

993
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:28,562
Scott: Yeah, it was great.

994
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,110
Rym: We'd love to have you on more often.

995
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:33,690
Rym: I want to set up some interesting topical round table.

996
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:35,950
Rym: I don't want to step on Friday Night Party line's toes.

997
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:38,370
Rym: Definitely want to go with a different kind of format.

998
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:46,490
Guest: Yeah, these podcasts are so personal that even if you had the exact same setup, it wouldn't be the same show because of your personality.

999
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:50,210
Rym: And again, that it's very hard to get a word in edgewise.

1000
01:07:51,172 --> 01:07:51,945
Guest: Yeah, right.

1001
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,220
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1002
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,860
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1003
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:15,760
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map and links to all the RSS feeds.

1004
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:22,020
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1005
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:24,100
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1006
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:26,720
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

1007
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:32,639
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1008
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:41,160
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1009
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,700
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

1010
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:50,219
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.
