1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,929
Scott: It's Wednesday, April 23rd.

2
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:12,692
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:13,294
Scott: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:14,940
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,560
Scott: Tonight we, I guess theoretically, primarily talk about Maurice the Jojo.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,740
Rym: Yeah, we totally blew off last night's show.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,080
Scott: Well, you know how, you know, the stuff that, you know, at work, there are some things, you know, you're just working on them.

9
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:43,500
Scott: And there are some other things where it's like, okay, you're just working on them, but there's a deadline.

10
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,322
Scott: And there's some other things.

11
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:45,847
Scott: you could work on it or not.

12
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:50,440
Scott: And then occasionally something will happen and you have to work on it right now.

13
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,132
Scott: Those things never happen unless you're about to leave.

14
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,460
Scott: They never happen as soon as you walk in in the morning.

15
00:00:57,101 --> 00:01:03,039
Rym: For three days in a row, I'll say this, I've barely escaped, but every day I leave work pretty much at four to catch the 4.10 train.

16
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,282
Rym: It's so perfect.

17
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:09,801
Rym: But every day for the last three days, I'll be sitting there and it's like, all right, it's 3.58.

18
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:14,234
Rym: Putting my laptop away, getting ready to say, all right, guys, I'll see you tomorrow.

19
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,220
Rym: 3.59, someone walks over.

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,688
Rym: Hey, Rym, can you look at this real quick?

21
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:19,773
Rym: This doesn't look right.

22
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:20,717
Rym: Oh, no.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,285
Rym: Type, type, type, type, type, type.

24
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:24,713
Rym: Look good, look good, fine.

25
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:24,974
Rym: Bye.

26
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:25,899
Rym: Run out the door.

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,024
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:37,241
Scott: There needs to be sort of like a time, like if you come after, you could come to me after 3.30.

29
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,746
Scott: No, it doesn't matter what it is.

30
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,131
Scott: It could be the end of the company.

31
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:42,600
Scott: I'm not, forget about it.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,505
Rym: You know what's scary?

33
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,090
Rym: I'll say this.

34
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,600
Scott: It needs to be like a handoff period.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,900
Rym: I actually like my company enough to where I would probably, if it was an emergency, stick around.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,960
Scott: Well, my policy in my work is if it's something that is the cause of me, I will stay there and fix it.

37
00:01:57,342 --> 00:01:59,460
Scott: If it's really important and you know we're losing money or whatever.

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:07,120
Rym: I would also stay if I can fix it without, like if I wouldn't be able to do any better than anyone else at fixing it, then I probably wouldn't stay.

39
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,199
Rym: But if it's something I could do or I know or I don't think anyone else could do it quickly, I would just do it.

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,650
Scott: Yeah, it really depends on the thing, but I make a judgment call.

41
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,700
Scott: If I feel responsible for it, I'll stay and do it.

42
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,418
Scott: And if I don't, then I'll be like, all right, you take care of it.

43
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:21,720
Scott: Bye.

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,566
Rym: Yeah, at least with my work, we have this overlap.

45
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:27,900
Rym: Like I work seven to four and this other guy works like 9.30 to 6.30.

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,266
Rym: So we kind of overlap there.

47
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:32,700
Rym: So if there's a big problem, he can usually cover it at the end of the day.

48
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:37,439
Rym: And kind of the payback for that is that I got to be there in the morning when other things go wrong.

49
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,679
Scott: See, we don't have things go wrong in the morning.

50
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:45,220
Rym: It's more that I got to show up every morning at the crack as dawn and make sure everything's going to be OK.

51
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:46,646
Rym: I turn on the lights.

52
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:47,672
Rym: I pick up the mail.

53
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:48,738
Rym: I do all that stuff, too.

54
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:49,100
Rym: It's fun.

55
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:52,720
Scott: My computers give it here tomorrow.

56
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:58,120
Scott: I'm actually most of it's here now, except for the case, the CPU and the hard drives.

57
00:02:58,824 --> 00:02:59,799
Scott: Sort of important parts.

58
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,119
Rym: But actually, the reason we didn't do a show last night was Scott had one of those.

59
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:05,786
Rym: All right, look at this.

60
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:06,770
Rym: Fix it things.

61
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,360
Rym: But he text messaged me while I'm on the train.

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,089
Rym: It's like, I'm going to be late.

63
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,240
Rym: But he didn't say how late.

64
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:14,854
Rym: So I had a choice to make.

65
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:15,479
Rym: All right.

66
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,759
Rym: Do I query him to find out how late he will be and make plans accordingly to do the show?

67
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:25,819
Rym: Or do I assume he's not coming home, totally go out to dinner with Emily and then hang out?

68
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,240
Rym: So Scott finally did get home.

69
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,880
Scott: You knew that if I'm late, it's going to be at least one train, which is already enough time to eat dinner and still do a show.

70
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,696
Rym: Yeah, but if it was that, you probably wouldn't have even told me.

71
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:44,360
Rym: Oh, I was looking for an excuse to not do the show because it's been.

72
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,980
Scott: You're always like every day you're looking for an excuse to not do the show.

73
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:47,618
Rym: Not today.

74
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:50,920
Scott: It's only because you feel bad about not doing the show yesterday.

75
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,776
Scott: You had a choice of being here and doing the show.

76
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:53,897
Scott: Right.

77
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,780
Scott: Or going outside and going, ah, would you sit here, do the show?

78
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,320
Scott: Would you go outside?

79
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:01,759
Rym: See, the thing is, I do have a choice.

80
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:02,657
Scott: You do.

81
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:03,337
Scott: And I'm here.

82
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,099
Scott: No, but you feel obligated despite it.

83
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:08,560
Scott: You know, they're not actually being a real obligation.

84
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:11,700
Scott: Yeah, you have it created for yourself a duty.

85
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,000
Rym: I think you forget that I get home like an hour before you.

86
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,560
Rym: So I got home and then I went for this crazy long run and then I did all this other stuff outside.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,158
Rym: So I'm kind of sated right now.

88
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,199
Scott: Even still.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,340
Rym: Plus, I got the window open right there despite all the noise going on out there.

90
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,159
Scott: Anyway, what else we got going on?

91
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,633
Rym: I don't know.

92
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,060
Rym: Normally we talk about anime news or comic news, but is there any anime news or comic news that we care about?

93
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,939
Scott: Well, I mean, there was this huge New York comic convention.

94
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:39,618
Scott: All right.

95
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,559
Scott: Whole weekend.

96
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:43,358
Scott: And there's a lot of news from it.

97
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:46,700
Scott: But really, I don't think any of it is news worthy.

98
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,658
Scott: It's mostly we license this, we announce that, and it's all just kind of bled.

99
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,940
Scott: There's nothing like, oh man, something to discuss or something awesome.

100
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,699
Scott: It's mostly just...

101
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:03,040
Rym: What could possibly... It'd have to be something crazy like, oh, by the way, they're making another Ghost in the Shell movie.

102
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,040
Rym: Or like, oh, by the way, I don't know, something crazy.

103
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,060
Scott: I mean, they could announce things that are actual news.

104
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,817
Scott: Something interesting.

105
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,060
Rym: Well, what's your line, though?

106
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,320
Rym: I mean, there was interesting news.

107
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,080
Rym: It's just it's not news that, while it may be interesting, there's not much for us to comment on.

108
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,700
Scott: And it's not interesting if there's nothing for us to comment on.

109
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,176
Rym: Yeah, there is.

110
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,940
Rym: Because it's partly that we're not the first line of news.

111
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,240
Rym: If you want to just find out what happened, like just the objective facts, just go read the Anime News Network.

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,000
Rym: They'll tell you everything that got licensed and everything.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,720
Scott: At least anime wise.

114
00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:32,304
Rym: Yeah.

115
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,340
Rym: And comic wise, you can find all that news.

116
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,220
Rym: So we're not going to just say news that happens unless we have something personal to say about it.

117
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,422
Scott: Right.

118
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,000
Scott: And none of the news that happened.

119
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,700
Scott: It was all just announcements of new things and boring shit like that.

120
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,460
Scott: So there's no thing to discuss except for what happened.

121
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,041
Rym: Yeah.

122
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,220
Rym: Well, like I'm saying, that news wasn't interesting.

123
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,599
Scott: Hence, it's not interesting news.

124
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,550
Rym: Well, not to us personally.

125
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:56,120
Rym: A lot of those shows people really cared about.

126
00:05:56,462 --> 00:05:58,679
Scott: I say if there's nothing to discuss...

127
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:01,393
Rym: Alright, can you name one piece of these newses?

128
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:02,760
Rym: Because I think you're just saying.

129
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,960
Scott: There's that Stanley Manga thingy.

130
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:07,589
Rym: Yeah?

131
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:07,795
Rym: Yeah.

132
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,651
Rym: That wasn't announced at the Comic Con.

133
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:10,899
Rym: That was announced a long time ago.

134
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,980
Scott: No, but it's like, you know, they show off stuff.

135
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,465
Rym: But there was no news about it.

136
00:06:14,546 --> 00:06:17,960
Rym: It was just, hey, just in case you forgot that thing's still coming.

137
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,099
Rym: Had they announced it at the New York Comic Con?

138
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,140
Scott: It was effectively like the, you know, they had said, you know, they basically said Stanley Ultimo.

139
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,570
Scott: And then at the convention, like, okay, here it is.

140
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,433
Scott: Here's the pictures.

141
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:31,040
Scott: Here's all the more information, you know.

142
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,940
Rym: But a lot of that information was already available.

143
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,344
Scott: Oh, not really.

144
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:38,260
Scott: And then, you know, it's like there were new trailers for TV shows and movies.

145
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:43,820
Scott: And there's all sorts of news about new comics coming out from all the comic companies.

146
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:44,824
Scott: We're making this.

147
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:45,707
Scott: We're making that.

148
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:47,814
Scott: We're making more graphic novels.

149
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,500
Scott: We're making more Spidermans.

150
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,799
Scott: You know, all that kind of bullshit.

151
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:54,020
Rym: But had they actually announced the Ultimo thing, I would have had something to say.

152
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,839
Rym: Again, I still have something to say because we never covered it.

153
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:57,779
Rym: I'll say this about Ultimo.

154
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,040
Rym: They're not selling or marketing or promoting Ultimo in any way.

155
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,280
Rym: They are promoting, marketing, and selling Stan Lee's Ultimo.

156
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,380
Rym: You look at this poster they had up and it was like, Stan Lee and the biggest letters they could fit.

157
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,086
Rym: And a big picture of his face.

158
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:16,420
Rym: And then much smaller than that, Ultimo coming soon.

159
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:18,419
Rym: And then a picture of something from Ultimo.

160
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,380
Rym: Obviously, this is gonna be some generic comic that is being sold primarily on the name Stan Lee.

161
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,823
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

162
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:29,873
Scott: I predict not so good.

163
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:31,060
Scott: What do you predict?

164
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:33,445
Rym: I think it's gonna be average.

165
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:34,350
Rym: I don't think it'll be bad.

166
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,113
Rym: I don't think it'll be good.

167
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,520
Rym: I think it'll be an average comic.

168
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,387
Scott: Well, I'm not buying it.

169
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:38,700
Scott: That's for sure.

170
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,877
Rym: We gotta review it.

171
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:40,738
Scott: No, we don't.

172
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:41,279
Rym: Yeah, we do.

173
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,239
Scott: Well, then you can go buy it.

174
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:43,919
Rym: I'll acquire it somehow.

175
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,340
Scott: Well, go to the comic book store next to the train station and buy it.

176
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,179
Rym: No, someone will send it to me, I'm sure.

177
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:49,467
Scott: I'm sure.

178
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,839
Scott: Stan Lee's gonna send it to you?

179
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,399
Rym: Not Stan Lee, but someone else will.

180
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,200
Scott: Alright, we'll see about that.

181
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,890
Rym: I mean, I've gotten so many crappy comics in the mail.

182
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,780
Rym: I figure someday someone other than Vertical is gonna send us something good.

183
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,639
Scott: Yeah, well, I'm not buying it.

184
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,746
Rym: Actually, it's scary.

185
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:07,200
Rym: I mean, instead of doing news, we can talk a little bit about the New York Comic-Con.

186
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:13,360
Rym: Unlike other conventions, we're not gonna dedicate an entire show to the New York Comic-Con.

187
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,640
Rym: Because there's not nearly as much to say about it as I would have to say after going to say Otakon or Katsu-Con.

188
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,300
Scott: Yep.

189
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:25,060
Scott: But basically, New York Comic-Con, better than the pre- it's the third year, I think, yes.

190
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,605
Scott: Yes, the third year of this con.

191
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,240
Scott: And it was superior to the previous years.

192
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,917
Scott: Unlike the first year, you could get in.

193
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:35,179
Scott: Unlike the second year, there was more than one entrance.

194
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:36,779
Scott: And there were wider aisles.

195
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:41,840
Scott: So, it's actually, you know, the con is pretty much just one big room.

196
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,840
Scott: And it's got, you know, dealing in one corner.

197
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,300
Scott: It's got exhibitors in most of the space.

198
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:51,520
Scott: It's got a big-ass artist alley in the other corner.

199
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:54,740
Scott: And then there's a little stage with a bunch of chairs.

200
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,233
Scott: And they sort of do random shit.

201
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:57,060
Scott: that's just fucked up.

202
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,260
Rym: I have things to say about that.

203
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:02,960
Scott: And then behind the stage, hidden in the corner, is like a little podcast area.

204
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:10,380
Scott: And it's just this giant, you know, it's like, I say, two-thirds of the main Javits room, right?

205
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:15,360
Scott: And the aisles were even on, you know, we didn't go Saturday.

206
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:20,740
Scott: But even on crowded Friday, you could sort of, at least as long as you weren't in the artist's alley, there was room to walk around.

207
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:23,599
Scott: Sunday was nice and light, just kind of ahhh.

208
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:33,560
Scott: And just like the year before, you go there, you walk around the big room, you see what there is to see, and there's no reason to hang around.

209
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:44,601
Scott: Because most of the panels are pretty boring, except there was one panel that was Doug Rushkoff and Scott McCloud, but it was really early on Friday when I was not able to go at like 1 o'clock p.m There

210
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:56,539
Rym: was also ICV2, which I didn't, if I'd taken the day off work, which I kind of wanted to because you get cocktails and stuff, and it looks like it's a pretty fun thing for a press person, but I wasn't going to take Thursday off of work for that.

211
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,818
Scott: No, no, I wasn't.

212
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:00,520
Rym: But pretty much, I do want to point out one thing.

213
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:17,140
Rym: We had several listeners point out that this was like their first convention, and they seem to have a good time, but I do want to say that the New York Comic-Con is very typical of any sort of comic convention, but pretty much almost not in any way similar to an average anime convention.

214
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,420
Scott: Well, see, I'm actually starting to realize, right?

215
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,960
Scott: It doesn't have much to do with the subject matter of the convention.

216
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:26,940
Scott: It has to do with whether it's fan-run or for-profit.

217
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:36,839
Scott: There are for-profit anime cons besides the New York Anime Festival, and they're mostly just like a big, boring dealer's room.

218
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:44,320
Rym: But not really to the extent of this because it seems like comic conventions in general, commercial or I don't know how many fan-run ones there are.

219
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:45,278
Rym: I'm sure there's some.

220
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,900
Rym: But they're so focused on the buying and the selling and that sort of thing that the biggest complaint...

221
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:00,060
Scott: It is true that fan-run comic conventions are more focused on the buying, are more like for-profit other conventions.

222
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:11,958
Rym: But the biggest complaint, the only main complaint I had about the New York Comic-Con was that everywhere I walked, unlike any other conventions I go to, and I remember this happened at Philly Wizard World too, people kept ramming into me.

223
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:13,713
Rym: Now, there's crowds at anime conventions.

224
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Scott: There were bigger aisles this year, despite there being, you know, they had a lot more stuff, but they had a lot more space, and the aisles were adequately wide.

225
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:35,180
Rym: Yeah, but what I'm saying is that, you know, I was walking around this convention, like, I mean, Otakon has gigantic crowds and crazy crowds, and you can't walk anywhere, and Katsuokon's like that, but at all those anime conventions, I don't really get bumped into a lot.

226
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:52,140
Rym: You just, like, everyone is kind of close together, but everyone's walking and nice orderly and da-da-da-da-da, and people are sitting in the sides, but at this convention and at Philly Wizard World and at the previous New York Comic Convention, I was rammed into by people, like, kind of hard a lot, constantly.

227
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:54,012
Scott: No one rammed me that hard.

228
00:11:54,052 --> 00:11:56,259
Scott: If someone did ram me that hard, I'd probably push them over.

229
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:10,120
Rym: Well, no, you're really missing the point, not like ram you, like, to the point that they would knock you over, it would hurt, but running into me at a speed that was well above what is acceptable, and people were, like, swinging bags into me and onto other people, and I saw other people, the same thing.

230
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,160
Rym: It's like everyone was kind of bumping into each other and bumping into tables and knocking stuff over.

231
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,000
Scott: Well, I mean, you have a giant room, right, and despite wide enough aisles, you've got a shit ton of people in this room.

232
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:25,900
Scott: Yeah, but what I'm trying to point out is that there are things in every possible direction grabbing people's attention.

233
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:32,220
Rym: What I'm trying to point out is that this doesn't happen at the dealer's rooms at anime cons I go to that are just as crowded, if not more so.

234
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,280
Scott: Well, the dealer's room at an anime con isn't the whole con.

235
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:47,920
Scott: It's one small part of the con, and it has smaller aisles, but it doesn't matter that it has smaller aisles because a smaller percentage of the con is in there at any one time, and there's also a lot less, like, attention-grabbing in different directions.

236
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,840
Scott: It's straight aisles.

237
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,785
Scott: Did you say that at all?

238
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,620
Rym: It was straight aisles here, too, and there's the same thing.

239
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:53,779
Scott: Not really.

240
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,260
Rym: Yeah, they were straight aisles.

241
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,117
Scott: The layout of the room wasn't a perfect grid, you know, like...

242
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:00,740
Rym: There were a couple of minor variations.

243
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:03,980
Rym: It's pretty much exactly the same as an anime con dealer's room.

244
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:05,759
Scott: Eh, not really.

245
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:14,320
Rym: The only difference, I think, because the dealer's room at Otakon is actually a lot more crowded than this place at any given moment.

246
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:37,680
Rym: I think the difference is that anime cons, because they have these other places that aren't dealer's rooms, a lot of times at an anime con, you see people walking around who, they've already looked at stuff, and now they're just kind of chilling, and they're either looking for somewhere to sit down and chill, or they're kind of walking slowly off somewhere to chill in a nice, quiet area and hang out, and they're not just doing anything in particular, but at comic cons, there really aren't places to chill so much.

247
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:38,140
Scott: The lobby?

248
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:41,900
Rym: The lobby is it, and that's pretty far away from everything else.

249
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,160
Rym: You gotta walk all the way out.

250
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,040
Scott: Well, they had the beanbag area, and they had all the chairs by the stage.

251
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:52,920
Rym: Yeah, those couple of areas on the far ends, but it seems like most people who were walking around weren't even looking at anything.

252
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:02,180
Rym: They were just kind of walking slow, chilling, but because it's all just one big dealer's room, they were just kind of walking, chilling, in the middle of where everyone else was walking, trying to go somewhere.

253
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,959
Rym: But even then, I don't understand why so many people bumped into me.

254
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:07,060
Scott: Yeah, I don't get it.

255
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,540
Rym: Like, it was really, really apparent that people were bumping into me a lot more than any other public place I've ever been.

256
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,880
Scott: Alright, well, I mean, there was some bumping going on, but I guess I didn't notice it as much as you did.

257
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,639
Rym: It was just, well, you were ramming into me, too.

258
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:29,855
Scott: Yeah, well, to the convention's credit, actually, they did have a whole area that we were able to find, even though it was far away from everything else, that had a whole bunch of panels, like 200-plus panels.

259
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,000
Scott: The thing was, is except for a very small handful of the panels, I was completely not interested in any of them.

260
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,820
Rym: Well, that's just, Scott, I was actually interested in quite a few of the panels.

261
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,540
Scott: Well, I think most of the panels, though, were just so-and-so company, so-and-so other company.

262
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:49,056
Scott: Not a lot of it was like, "Ooh, something actually

263
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:49,519
Scott: interesting.".

264
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:50,066
Rym: Like what?

265
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:50,980
Rym: What would be interesting?

266
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,760
Scott: Well, like that one panel I couldn't get to on Friday at one.

267
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,552
Rym: Okay, so what else would be interesting?

268
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:56,480
Rym: You were real vague there.

269
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,219
Scott: People actually discussing something, as opposed to just advertising.

270
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,540
Rym: A lot of those panels didn't look like they were just advertising.

271
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,659
Rym: I mean, a lot of them did.

272
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:10,060
Scott: I think the vast majority of them were just some company advertising their new thing.

273
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:12,160
Rym: Okay, well, that's your opinion.

274
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:13,975
Scott: Go look at the list of panels.

275
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:14,279
Scott: You'll see.

276
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,699
Rym: Yeah, and there were a bunch I wanted to go to.

277
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,719
Rym: Actually, I was really interested in checking out that black panel, but Scott really didn't want to go, so we left.

278
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,886
Scott: Yeah, I wasn't.

279
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,580
Scott: What would I want to go to the black panel for?

280
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,810
Rym: I wanted to see what they had to say.

281
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,879
Rym: There was a lot of people lined up.

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,700
Rym: It looked interesting.

283
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,419
Scott: Yeah, it didn't look too interesting to me.

284
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,959
Rym: Okay, well, nothing ever looks interesting to you.

285
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,036
Scott: But even so, okay, so that's two panels out of 200-plus.

286
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,360
Rym: Actually, I really wanted to go to the Avatar panel, too.

287
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:38,420
Scott: That's a company selling something panel.

288
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:43,640
Rym: Well, it was something that I really want, and they were showing things that hadn't been seen before.

289
00:15:44,603 --> 00:16:00,220
Rym: I failed to get an interview with those people, partly because everyone failed to get interviews with those people, because as far as I could tell, pretty much every single member of the press wanted an interview with anyone associated with Avatar, and as a result, no one really got interviews.

290
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,660
Rym: In fact, the two creators, from what I hear, actually said, "Ah, never mind," and just kind of flew out early.

291
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:07,977
Scott: Even so, right, that's three out of 200-plus.

292
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,620
Scott: That's pretty sad.

293
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,420
Rym: Well, I'm saying, of the time I was there, I can think of a couple more.

294
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,419
Rym: They were all told maybe five or six panels that I probably would have wanted to go to, which is-- Out of 200 is really sad.

295
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:19,656
Scott: Not necessarily.

296
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:22,100
Scott: I mean, at an anime convention.

297
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,040
Scott: Besides, not every anime convention.

298
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,900
Rym: Not interesting to you or maybe to me, but there were panels where people-- If you're into these comics, there were people who have a lot to do with these comics.

299
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,211
Scott: I guess that is true, is that-- That is true.

300
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,620
Rym: I don't understand why you're so down on these panels.

301
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:41,820
Scott: Because every time I went down there to look at the panel schedules, there's absolutely nothing I wanted to go to.

302
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,539
Rym: Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

303
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:43,480
Rym: Every time.

304
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,039
Rym: You went down there once for like five minutes.

305
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,279
Scott: I went down there three times.

306
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,539
Rym: You went down there once for like five minutes with me.

307
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,839
Rym: You walked past every time.

308
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,758
Rym: Literally, you walked in, you're like, "Well, that sucks, that sucks, that sucks, let's

309
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:52,900
Rym: leave.".

310
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,240
Scott: But it wasn't just the panel that was currently in there that sucked.

311
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,540
Scott: I looked at the entire schedule for the day, and I said, "Nothing in this room at all.

312
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,392
Scott: Nothing in this room at

313
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:00,616
Scott: all.".

314
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,820
Rym: Yeah, and meanwhile, I actually wanted to stay for some, but Scott was getting impatient.

315
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,198
Scott: What did you want to stay for?

316
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:07,079
Rym: The Black Panel, among other things.

317
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:08,699
Rym: And some of the ones I was walking by.

318
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,316
Rym: There were pretty big crowds, and they were doing Q&A.

319
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,180
Rym: Someone might ask an interesting question.

320
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,280
Scott: Yeah, right.

321
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:14,940
Scott: Like in what, the DC panel?

322
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,760
Rym: The DC panel that you refused to stay at for more than two minutes, so we only got to hear one question.

323
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:20,500
Scott: It was just fan--.

324
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:22,859
Scott: I heard like three questions that were all fanboys.

325
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:23,425
Rym: Yeah.

326
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,059
Scott: They were all fanboys asking stupid shit about like, "Oh, why didn't Superman do this?

327
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,272
Scott: Why didn't Green Lantern do

328
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:29,536
Scott: that?".

329
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,120
Rym: There wasn't a single question like that.

330
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:32,699
Scott: Yeah, there were.

331
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,478
Rym: Actually, no.

332
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:47,439
Rym: The only question we saw was, someone asked one question about like when a comic's coming out, and then the next question was the moderator actually asking the audience if any of them had like stopped reading comics, and then something got them to read comics again.

333
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:51,397
Rym: And they were all telling like, "Well, I stopped reading when blah, like this

334
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:51,659
Rym: year.".

335
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,776
Rym: Or like, "When these superheroes got all weird, I didn't understand them anymore, and I never started reading

336
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:56,999
Rym: again.".

337
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,097
Rym: Or, "I started reading again because they reset

338
00:17:59,138 --> 00:17:59,299
Rym: this.".

339
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,354
Rym: Or, you know, "I just randomly picked up a comic, and actually it was kind of interesting, but Scott was like, "Eh, let's go, let's

340
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:04,576
Rym: go.".

341
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,399
Scott: It wasn't interesting because they were all talking about DC Universe BS, not comics as a whole BS.

342
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,959
Rym: So it's not interesting to you?

343
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:11,459
Rym: Yeah.

344
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,337
Rym: What if you like DC?

345
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,120
Scott: No, I don't like any of that shit.

346
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,268
Rym: I like how you want to be.

347
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:19,720
Rym: so, before the con, you're like, "Man, we got to be so objective with press.

348
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,513
Rym: We got to be like, we got to cover things and be objective and serious

349
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:22,780
Rym: business.".

350
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:26,240
Rym: And all you did was walk around the con loudly proclaiming that everything sucked.

351
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,900
Scott: Yeah, well, it's kind of hard.

352
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,320
Scott: I realized I sort of had to have a press hat and a fan hat.

353
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,500
Rym: But you never put on a press hat.

354
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,200
Rym: Even when you were trying to film stuff.

355
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,760
Rym: There's these Star Wars people that were fighting on stage.

356
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,580
Rym: Scott was loudly saying, pretty much everyone in earshot would hear him going, "Wow, this is lame.

357
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:45,260
Rym: Wow, these guys suck.

358
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:46,512
Rym: Wow, this is so

359
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:47,079
Rym: stupid.".

360
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:50,610
Rym: Everyone was kind of turning around and looking at him like, "Seriously, what's your

361
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,096
Rym: problem?".

362
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:53,600
Scott: It was pretty lame though, you got to admit.

363
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,060
Rym: While it was pretty lame, I thought you wanted to be objective press.

364
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,640
Scott: I was wearing my fan hat at the time.

365
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,940
Rym: I don't think you own a press hat.

366
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:02,000
Scott: I got to get one.

367
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,120
Scott: I don't think you own one.

368
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,959
Scott: It's very easy.

369
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:06,580
Scott: It's one thing to know what to do.

370
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,919
Scott: It's much harder to actually do what you know what to do.

371
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,255
Scott: Technically, I academically can get a book that says, "Aha, this is how to draw a beautiful

372
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:16,818
Scott: picture."

373
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,460
Scott: And it's another thing to actually draw a beautiful picture.

374
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:24,800
Rym: But in regards to the Star Wars thing, while I don't quite have the venom that I guess Scott had for these people.

375
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,439
Scott: I don't have venom.

376
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:33,420
Scott: I just think it's really lame and it's kind of sad watching these people sort of act like they're legitimate and cool and worthy of respect.

377
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:38,440
Scott: When they're just a bunch of like really sad adults acting like little children.

378
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,180
Rym: But once, Scott, they were like teenagers, all of them.

379
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,399
Scott: No, that guy was like 20-something for sure.

380
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:45,780
Rym: No, he definitely wasn't.

381
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,440
Scott: No, definitely was.

382
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,840
Rym: And most of the people on stage were clearly in high school.

383
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,099
Scott: No, that's how it looked like to me.

384
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:51,800
Rym: Okay.

385
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,426
Scott: Yeah.

386
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,860
Scott: Why don't we go find out exactly how old those people were.

387
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,574
Scott: They were definitely most of them in their 20s.

388
00:19:58,744 --> 00:19:59,859
Scott: If not 30-some of them.

389
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,266
Rym: I disagree with you pretty much 100%.

390
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:02,475
Rym: Yeah.

391
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,618
Rym: You've got your film.

392
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,840
Rym: Go pull the film out and put it on YouTube or something.

393
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:08,860
Scott: It's a really bad film because I suck at the camera.

394
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,120
Scott: Yeah.

395
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:20,780
Scott: I have the same problem with the video camera that I have with the photo camera in that I carry it and I want to video things but I just, I don't.

396
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:23,540
Rym: Well, I kept telling you two and you kept putting the camera away.

397
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,070
Rym: I'd be like, "Scott, film

398
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,272
Rym: this.".

399
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,680
Rym: You put the camera away.

400
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,459
Rym: By the time he fumbles it out, the thing's over.

401
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,360
Rym: And then he immediately puts the camera back away.

402
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,840
Scott: Yeah, it's like I had, well, because carrying it, first of all, is very annoying.

403
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,320
Rym: Dude, I had the Marantz and the microphone and all that business.

404
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,379
Scott: That's easier to carry.

405
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:38,100
Scott: Not really.

406
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,079
Scott: Because you don't, yeah it is.

407
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,920
Rym: It's actually heavier than that camera.

408
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,940
Scott: It's not about the weight.

409
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,020
Rym: The microphone itself is heavier than the camera.

410
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:46,260
Rym: I had that big XLR cable.

411
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,080
Rym: Thing was jangling around, hit me in the thigh.

412
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:50,300
Rym: I had to keep fiddling with the radio and I was-.

413
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,939
Scott: The point is that if I'm using the camera, I have to like have my hand in front of my face and I can't like do anything else.

414
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,960
Scott: I can't like talk or look around or anything.

415
00:20:59,161 --> 00:20:59,440
Scott: Okay.

416
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,900
Scott: Like you can interview someone and look around and walk.

417
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,440
Rym: Not really.

418
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,119
Rym: I pretty much have to stare constantly at the meters and keep adjusting the levels.

419
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,540
Scott: Nah, it's not necessary.

420
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:09,520
Rym: Actually it's very necessary.

421
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,660
Rym: I've gotten a lot better at that.

422
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,780
Rym: That's why the short interview clip I have with the International Office of French Publishers, I think, publications.

423
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:19,159
Rym: I forget exactly.

424
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,300
Rym: It sounds really good, but all the interviews I did at every con before sounds awful.

425
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:38,400
Scott: Anyway, this isn't helping people, but basically if you like comics at all, right, and you're near New York, if you're far away, but if you're near enough to New York, it's probably worth your time to go to the New York Comic Con one of the days.

426
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,955
Scott: I suggest either Friday night or Sunday.

427
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:43,239
Scott: Saturday's probably not worth it.

428
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,819
Scott: And just go around, look at all the stuff, and then go home.

429
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:49,159
Scott: And that's worth it.

430
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,620
Scott: But otherwise, it's really not so much worth it.

431
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:54,060
Rym: I can say one thing.

432
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,400
Rym: On Friday I saw probably the best Avatar cosplayers I've ever seen.

433
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:05,260
Rym: It was one of those groups of people where obviously they got all their friends who kind of already look like characters.

434
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:09,480
Rym: We have a friend who looks exactly like a character from Bleach.

435
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,060
Rym: So if she cosplays as that character, it looks like this crazy amazing cosplay.

436
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,820
Rym: But all of these kids looked exactly like the people in Avatar.

437
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:27,780
Rym: Furthermore, they dressed up in Fire Nation, which is kind of like what they're wearing in the third season, and it was totally awesome.

438
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,140
Rym: I talked to them briefly.

439
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,160
Rym: I didn't give them a flyer because I didn't want to reach into my bag, but if you guys somehow find GeekNights, you guys were totally awesome.

440
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,420
Rym: Especially whoever it was who was in that gigantic Appa costume.

441
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,034
Scott: I bet you if you hadn't suddenly become like an Avatar fanboy, you wouldn't even notice them.

442
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,160
Rym: Suddenly become.

443
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,800
Rym: I've wanted, pretty much as long as I've known about Avatar, I've known it was good.

444
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,816
Rym: And now that I've actually watched it, I just confirmed that it was as good as I thought it was.

445
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,420
Rym: In fact, a little better than I expected.

446
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:55,700
Scott: Yeah.

447
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:56,300
Scott: Anyway.

448
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:59,499
Rym: Anyway, I don't know what it is, why you hate Avatar.

449
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:01,000
Scott: I don't hate Avatar.

450
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,994
Scott: It's just from what I've seen, it's.

451
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,620
Rym: Which is nothing.

452
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:05,920
Scott: I've seen enough.

453
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:06,217
Scott: Yeah.

454
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,480
Scott: It really seems like a kid's show that a lot of people like.

455
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:15,060
Scott: And while I'm not going to pass a judgment on it until actually seeing it.

456
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,680
Rym: But what have you seen?

457
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,834
Rym: You walked past the TV.

458
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,559
Scott: I have no expectation for it.

459
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,440
Scott: And I have a lot of things above it in the queue.

460
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,919
Scott: And I have no reason to have a high expectation of it.

461
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,344
Rym: Uh-huh.

462
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,440
Rym: Despite the fact, you see, because you poo-pooed like this book you're reading now.

463
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,000
Rym: I didn't poo-poo it.

464
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,859
Scott: No, you very clearly poo-pooed it.

465
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,379
Scott: I didn't poo-poo.

466
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:32,840
Scott: I passed no judgment.

467
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,040
Scott: And I said, I'll get to it eventually.

468
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:37,400
Scott: And eventually, I got to it.

469
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:39,060
Scott: Yeah.

470
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:40,599
Rym: So can I, all right.

471
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,880
Rym: Well, I guess you hated the comic convention at least.

472
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:43,977
Scott: I didn't hate it.

473
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,000
Rym: You hated all the panels and everything on stage.

474
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,011
Scott: No, it was --.

475
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:50,560
Rym: Well, you already said you didn't like all the panels.

476
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,059
Rym: No, the panels -- And everything on that stage.

477
00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:57,399
Scott: The handful of panels that I wanted to go to, I couldn't go to.

478
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:03,120
Scott: For having 200 panels, a very small percentage of them were non-advertising panels.

479
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:12,420
Scott: But no matter what, if you're interested in something geeky, there probably were, you know, like five panels there for you at least, because they were just such a quantity.

480
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,859
Scott: You'll be interested in at least a handful of them.

481
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,620
Scott: But when is that handful going to be scheduled?

482
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:22,698
Scott: You know, you'd have to figure out, you know, look at the schedule ahead of time and go at that, you know, when they were going to be.

483
00:24:23,603 --> 00:24:25,300
Scott: And usually, they probably wouldn't be grouped up.

484
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:35,959
Scott: So like, you know, if out of the 200 panels, there were five you were interested in, you know, good luck actually getting to more than one of them, because that would require going all three days, which is way too long to spend at this thing.

485
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:42,020
Rym: Well, I can at least say one thing that Scott probably won't argue with like everything else, and those kids were totally in high school.

486
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,460
Rym: But anyway, I'm glad we didn't bother getting a table at this time.

487
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:57,399
Rym: And I think other than Otakon, where we're doing something kind of awesome with the front row crew and Katsucon, where we pretty much set like set up like the entire front of the video game room.

488
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:00,860
Rym: I don't think I'm going to bother getting tables at conventions ever again.

489
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,940
Rym: Like, it seems like, yeah, completely not worth it unless we're selling swag.

490
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,660
Scott: I see no reason to get a table at the convention.

491
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,360
Rym: But even then, I'm not really going to sit at the table.

492
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:11,699
Rym: I'll hire someone to sell the swag.

493
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:12,560
Scott: No, yeah.

494
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,378
Scott: You know, but I'd be at the table maybe like for scheduled times, you know, and that's actually something else.

495
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,499
Scott: The artist's alley was really big.

496
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:22,640
Scott: And last year the artist's alley was small and too crowded.

497
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:22,999
Scott: Right.

498
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:23,878
Scott: So it was much better.

499
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:30,700
Scott: And last year, the artist's alley at this convention was basically all like A-list people, like holy shit people.

500
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:31,199
Scott: Right.

501
00:25:31,522 --> 00:25:33,500
Scott: Which has also contributed to its crowdedness.

502
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:38,660
Scott: This year, there were still some holy shit people in the artist's alley, but not as many.

503
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:39,260
Scott: Right.

504
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:43,140
Scott: And there were plenty of, you know, B-list awesome people.

505
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,920
Scott: They were still awesome.

506
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,959
Scott: They just weren't, you know, A-list famous people in there.

507
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:57,160
Scott: But other than like the peak hours, I'd say like up to 40 percent of the artist's alley, just no one was at their tables and there were empty tables all over the place.

508
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,780
Scott: Like on Sunday, a lot of the tables are empty, you know, so it was either too crowded.

509
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,080
Scott: You can't really look at anything or it's not crowded now.

510
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:08,139
Scott: Oh, there's like people missing.

511
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:09,380
Scott: I can't see their shit.

512
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:19,420
Scott: So like there was awesome stuff in the artist's alley, but I barely even got to see anyone in the artist's alley because they either weren't there when I was there or it was too crowded.

513
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,916
Scott: I couldn't get through and it wasn't worth it.

514
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:24,360
Rym: But there was one absolutely awesome thing at the con.

515
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:30,280
Rym: On Saturday night, TM Revolution had his concert, which went crazily well.

516
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:31,558
Scott: Except we weren't there.

517
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:33,920
Rym: Well, because we ended up having to skip Saturday.

518
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,940
Rym: You had to miss anyway because your family stuff.

519
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:36,864
Scott: Yeah, they put the.

520
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:42,400
Scott: they put the convention on Passover, which is, you know, you know, I'm an atheist Jew, so it's not the biggest deal.

521
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:42,782
Scott: Right.

522
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:46,300
Scott: I wasn't like, oh, no, I'm going to Jew hell, which doesn't exist.

523
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:49,440
Scott: But, you know, my family was eating dinner.

524
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,538
Scott: It's like, huh, free dinner with family convention.

525
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,560
Scott: I'm spending a whole bunch of time for free anyway.

526
00:26:57,521 --> 00:26:58,657
Scott: TMR who I've already seen.

527
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:00,660
Scott: OK, I'll go get the free awesome.

528
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,819
Rym: But anyway, the main event for us, like because we weren't even going to go to the New York Comic Con, but we were kind of roped into it.

529
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:22,359
Rym: But the reason for all that was that on Sunday TM Revolution talking to our Nishikawa himself came to the Kinokuniya on because, you know, we set up this thing because we talked about this way back, but we're friends with the people here who'd work for like Tokyo FM.

530
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,518
Scott: And they were like, Brian, I think the company's GIO.

531
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:25,062
Scott: Right.

532
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:25,505
Scott: Yeah.

533
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:27,680
Rym: But they worked like they do stuff for Tokyo FM.

534
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,199
Rym: You know, the radio station in Tokyo.

535
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:29,782
Rym: Yeah.

536
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:33,120
Rym: And Brian Nishi is a host of this awesome baseball show.

537
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,380
Rym: If I if I was a baseball fan and I understood Japanese, this would be the show to listen to.

538
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,340
Rym: Yeah, seriously.

539
00:27:40,002 --> 00:27:45,020
Rym: This here in this energy, especially because, you know, the Japanese baseball is big to them.

540
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:45,926
Scott: Yeah, pretty big.

541
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:47,700
Scott: They don't have, you know, some of the other sports.

542
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,940
Scott: They don't have ice hockey, really.

543
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,477
Rym: Like baseball in Japan is the way hockey is.

544
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,696
Scott: They don't have basketball.

545
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,020
Rym: Baseball in Japan is as big as hockey is to me personally.

546
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,158
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

547
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:05,640
Rym: But so this was set up to where basically TMR came to the Kinokuniya for this big event.

548
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,700
Rym: And by the way, the upstairs was completely filled to capacity with fans.

549
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,930
Rym: It was kind of shelves.

550
00:28:11,132 --> 00:28:12,020
Rym: It was kind of crazy.

551
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,660
Scott: Smart fans would have sat in the Zaya.

552
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:21,640
Rym: Well, the thing is, it was tough to get in there because people had already had this idea and parked themselves in the Zaya well before this event.

553
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,939
Scott: Yeah, I'm not sure, though, how many people in the Zaya were parked for the event and how many just happened to be in there.

554
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:33,920
Rym: Well, I think next time what the Kinokuniya should probably do is try to work out a deal where the Zaya closes that part and doesn't sell.

555
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,940
Rym: But instead, they like sell snacks to people throughout the whole store for that one time or something.

556
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:46,800
Scott: Yeah, they need to make a deal with them because then you could actually put the, you know, like the people in the Zaya or something like that or have seating in there or something, you know, something.

557
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:55,760
Rym: But basically he came and there was an interview where he was the guest and he was interviewed by Brian Nishi and also interviewed by us.

558
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,440
Rym: We were brought up as like the big anime fans from America with the award winning, amazing anime podcast.

559
00:29:02,303 --> 00:29:05,160
Rym: And we were brought up there and we got to ask him three questions.

560
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:06,839
Rym: And I got to say a couple of things.

561
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:16,980
Rym: One, this guy Takanori Nishikawa, like the per pound energy in this band is like off the charts.

562
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,200
Scott: Well, either, right?

563
00:29:19,661 --> 00:29:24,420
Scott: First of all, they had a booth at the Comic-Con for TMR, right?

564
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:26,880
Scott: And they had some of his clothes there, like on mannequins.

565
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,500
Rym: Now we'd seen him in concert.

566
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,020
Scott: But we were far away.

567
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:40,300
Rym: And also he looked really tall and really big because, you know, when you're on stage and you're kind of like out in front of everyone else, like in front of the backup people and there's the lights, you look larger than life.

568
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,340
Scott: Especially when someone is so far away.

569
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,140
Rym: But even up close, you look like this kind of epic figure.

570
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:45,701
Scott: Yep.

571
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:51,400
Scott: In reality, TMR is a very, very, very small man.

572
00:29:51,882 --> 00:29:53,600
Scott: He is incredibly small.

573
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,800
Scott: Like, holy shit, is he small.

574
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,180
Rym: He is very pretty.

575
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:08,300
Rym: And in fact, multiple of the questions that were asked to him by people in the audience were related to, so how do you get your hair to look that way and how do you look so good and stuff like that.

576
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:16,540
Rym: Of course, I think I like this guy a lot because unlike the majority of interviews with Japanese stars I've heard, he gave some pretty funny answers.

577
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,066
Scott: Yeah, either.

578
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:21,640
Scott: He's like just really good, like a really great actor.

579
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:23,839
Scott: And he knew like awesome answers to say.

580
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:28,240
Scott: You know, it's always tough to tell when a famous person is genuine.

581
00:30:28,906 --> 00:30:30,260
Scott: You always have to have some skepticism.

582
00:30:30,602 --> 00:30:33,840
Scott: You know, like, are they just really good at pretending they love all their fans?

583
00:30:34,342 --> 00:30:36,500
Scott: Or do they actually love all their fans and are awesome?

584
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,540
Scott: And, you know, it doesn't really matter because you never know the person in real life.

585
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,000
Scott: So it doesn't matter if they're genuine or not.

586
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:48,080
Scott: What matters is they're awesome and providing the entertainment that you're looking for because they're an entertainer.

587
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:54,860
Rym: The thing is, though, I think he's genuine because actually one of the questions we asked, because it turns out that a long time ago he used to do a radio show.

588
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,773
Rym: It was like Takador Nishikawa's.

589
00:30:56,954 --> 00:30:57,740
Rym: All Night Nippon.

590
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,279
Scott: All Night Nippon.

591
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,939
Rym: It was funny because we printed it out.

592
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Scott: And it was question mark, are you Night Nippon?

593
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,980
Rym: Well, it was Naito, too.

594
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,180
Rym: So I was like, what is this?

595
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:08,979
Rym: It was in Romaji.

596
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,958
Rym: It was like, all right, what is this?

597
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:12,140
Rym: Why did Google cut off this character?

598
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:12,568
Rym: What was it?

599
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,060
Scott: Is it like Iru Naito Nippon?

600
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,899
Rym: Because, you know, we're dumb.

601
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,160
Rym: And we show it to people who speak Japanese.

602
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,076
Rym: They're like, no, all night.

603
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:22,040
Rym: Oh, you know, all night.

604
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,700
Scott: We're like, ah, oh, nice on the phone.

605
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:29,299
Rym: But apparently, like he did this radio show and he loved doing it.

606
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:33,459
Rym: And he only stopped because he kind of got so famous that he had no time to keep doing it.

607
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:38,900
Rym: And I think it's if nothing else, the energy that guy has is definitely genuine.

608
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,840
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

609
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,459
Scott: Definitely.

610
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,380
Scott: He seems to enjoy what he's doing.

611
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,619
Rym: The coolest thing is we asked him, like, you know, because he actually voice acted in Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny.

612
00:31:50,072 --> 00:31:50,239
Rym: Yeah.

613
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,620
Rym: Like he played minor like Gundam pilots.

614
00:31:53,221 --> 00:32:05,040
Rym: And he answered the question around by way where he basically said, you know, if you'd gone to me when I was a kid and told me that I would have effectively had my very own Gundam, I probably would have peed myself.

615
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:07,550
Rym: And then he proceeds to make a motion of.

616
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:11,340
Scott: he does like a hand gesture showing like, you know, he's like, yeah, peed all over the place.

617
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,960
Rym: Like the pea would have just gone everywhere.

618
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:13,560
Scott: Yeah.

619
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,660
Scott: So, yeah, he definitely is a funny guy.

620
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:19,957
Scott: He's pretty cool.

621
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:20,580
Scott: Yeah.

622
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,119
Scott: Whether you like his music or not, because, you know, not everyone likes that kind of music.

623
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,600
Scott: Whether you like Gundam or not, it doesn't matter either.

624
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:28,820
Scott: He is a pretty awesome person.

625
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,920
Rym: Not just Gundam, he's done music for other shows.

626
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:33,219
Scott: He's done music for plenty of things.

627
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,100
Rym: And actually, Walt TMR is like this very specific kind of music.

628
00:32:37,462 --> 00:32:44,820
Rym: He's also involved in this other project called the Abingdon Boys School, which if you if that name sounds familiar, think Radiohead.

629
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:47,139
Scott: Yeah, basically, he started another band.

630
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,840
Scott: Right.

631
00:32:48,481 --> 00:32:53,617
Scott: And he named called it Abingdon Boys School, which is the school that Radiohead, you know, started in.

632
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,560
Scott: So it's like an all boys school in, you know, England, Albion somewhere.

633
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,900
Scott: So he must.

634
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:00,919
Rym: What the hell is England?

635
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,980
Scott: He must be a Radiohead fan of some sort.

636
00:33:04,127 --> 00:33:04,340
Scott: Right.

637
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:08,120
Scott: That would be like if I made a band and I called it Strawberry Fields.

638
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,860
Rym: I really wanted to ask him about it, but because of time limitations, we only were able to ask him like three questions.

639
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,240
Scott: Basically, we submitted a bunch of questions, you know, and we decided, OK, well, it doesn't matter what questions we submit.

640
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:25,900
Scott: You know, if they have a high probability of actually getting making the cut or a low probability, doesn't matter.

641
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:34,119
Scott: You know, that way we can stick to our principle of ask hard questions, but then someone else decides which questions we're actually going to be able to ask.

642
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,880
Rym: The thing is though, what hard question can you ask him?

643
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,340
Rym: It's like, all right, so you're a musician.

644
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:48,359
Scott: I would go online and I'd research and find like his harshest critic and then like, you know, say, what do you think of, you know, this critic saying such and such about you?

645
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,039
Scott: The worst thing I can say.

646
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:55,160
Scott: I could have asked, you know, hey, your music is only popular because you attach it to popular anime.

647
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,360
Scott: Do you think that your music would be popular if you didn't attach it to any anime?

648
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,559
Rym: Yeah, except the answer based on Japan is already yes, very much.

649
00:34:02,043 --> 00:34:02,360
Scott: Yeah, I know.

650
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,760
Rym: But I'm just you can ask that kind of question.

651
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,699
Rym: One thing I find very interesting about TMR is that it's popular in America.

652
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,556
Rym: It seems like half of the people who know about TMR in America know about him because of Gundam seed.

653
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,150
Rym: But the other half of these people are.

654
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:24,320
Rym: there's a lot of people, especially in New York City, who are fans of Japanese music, like particularly J-Rock or J-Pop.

655
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,319
Rym: Oh, yeah, metal.

656
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,458
Rym: And they are fans of him.

657
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:28,920
Rym: They don't even know he was in Gundam.

658
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:29,474
Rym: They don't care.

659
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,320
Scott: Well, they know he was in Gundam.

660
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,058
Rym: But they're not.

661
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,320
Rym: Some of them I don't think did.

662
00:34:33,762 --> 00:34:35,699
Scott: Well, maybe a few didn't, but even so.

663
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,139
Rym: You can tell the J-Rockers in the audience as opposed to the anime fans.

664
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,039
Scott: You could definitely.

665
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:40,906
Rym: It was like this 40/40 mix.

666
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:51,360
Rym: And then the other 20% were actually, I don't know the deal, but it seemed like a bunch of people in Japan won this contest or something where they came with him to America to see the concert.

667
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:56,719
Rym: And there were all these Japanese schoolgirls like lined up outside the glass, like watching and yelling.

668
00:34:57,732 --> 00:34:58,399
Rym: It was pretty funny.

669
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:00,020
Scott: How long have we gone?

670
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:01,740
Rym: We should wrap this up.

671
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,118
Rym: The one last thing I got to say, and Scott will probably think this is lame, but I can't believe that.

672
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:07,760
Rym: I mean, I shook hands with TMR.

673
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,040
Rym: I was up there on stage with him.

674
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,758
Rym: It was pretty cool.

675
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:18,497
Rym: And he even like said, I give it like a 75% chance that he was serious, that he will listen to or at least check out what GeekNights is.

676
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:23,380
Rym: But beyond that, he high fived us again on his way out.

677
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:27,520
Rym: And then I got to kind of give the second hand five five to all the people behind me.

678
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:29,979
Rym: And I think that was pretty cool.

679
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:39,460
Rym: Are you like, yeah, it's just a person unlike you who is jaded about everything in the world and everything is met.

680
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:49,534
Scott: Unlike me, unlike you, who is not a teenage 13 year old girl who thinks that touching someone is like somehow magical and then touching somebody to touch someone is like magic rubbing off.

681
00:35:50,286 --> 00:35:51,079
Rym: It pretty much is.

682
00:35:51,222 --> 00:35:52,200
Scott: No, not really.

683
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,639
Rym: Concentrated magic that came off his hand and as cool a guy as he is.

684
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:57,222
Scott: Right.

685
00:35:57,282 --> 00:36:05,059
Scott: And as fun as he was and as awesome as the event was, he's just a dude, a really small dude, but a cool small dude.

686
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,340
Scott: And he's not magical.

687
00:36:07,521 --> 00:36:09,940
Scott: And high fiving him is not special.

688
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,607
Scott: Yes, it is.

689
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:11,159
Rym: And you suck.

690
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:12,320
Scott: No, it's not.

691
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,520
Scott: You're just mad about everything.

692
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,200
Scott: I'm not a 13 year old girl.

693
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,146
Rym: Whatever.

694
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:18,020
Rym: I think it was awesome.

695
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,580
Rym: But I can at least tell you all this is it won't be terribly useful.

696
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:24,619
Rym: I'm going to see if we can get permission to get the audio of this thing.

697
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:39,339
Rym: But if nothing else, if you really want to hear us asking TM Revolution some questions, it will be aired on Tokyo FM in the Tokyo, like, you know, metropolitan area at midnight, Eastern Daylight Time on Saturday.

698
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:40,699
Scott: That's terrific.

699
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:52,880
Scott: So maybe our friend Altimo Spalpin recorded someone driving late at night, you know, from down Mount Akina will turn on the radio and they'll hear GeekNights.

700
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:55,879
Rym: And the second time we've been on the radio in Japan.

701
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,861
Scott: All right.

702
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:06,930
Scott: Do you want to do the thing or go on the things of the day anyway?

703
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,790
Rym: Despite the fact that Scott doesn't understand the magic things of the day.

704
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:11,197
Scott: Yeah.

705
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:11,462
Scott: OK.

706
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:11,950
Rym: Yeah.

707
00:37:12,212 --> 00:37:12,617
Rym: I'm sorry.

708
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:13,769
Rym: You're not excited about things.

709
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:15,537
Scott: We better call Randy.

710
00:37:15,577 --> 00:37:18,312
Scott: then if it's the magic rubbed off on you, we can go get a million dollars.

711
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:20,722
Scott: Then you can go fly to Japan and high five again is in the bag.

712
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:25,070
Rym: Anyway, so this has been going around the Internet.

713
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,217
Rym: I'm sure a lot of you've seen it, but there's this video of a guy who was stuck in an elevator for 41 hours.

714
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:32,673
Scott: Wow.

715
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:34,250
Scott: That now that really sucks.

716
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,769
Scott: And it's basically the guys going nuts.

717
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:37,969
Scott: And I would also go nuts.

718
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:43,488
Rym: I particularly like how he cracked open the door and peed down the shaft because that's pretty much the only thing you can do.

719
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:44,257
Scott: Pretty much.

720
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:45,409
Scott: I'm surprised he didn't poop.

721
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:46,518
Scott: Did he not eat?

722
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:47,850
Scott: Well, I wonder what was up with that.

723
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:49,970
Rym: I can go a couple days without poop.

724
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:50,803
Rym: And if I have to.

725
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:51,026
Rym: Yeah.

726
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,730
Scott: But I mean, if I had to poop like it would, you know, it could cause some problems.

727
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:58,710
Rym: Well, if I had to poop, I would also see hydration starts to become a serious problem.

728
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,505
Scott: He probably would have been better off drinking his pee now.

729
00:38:01,731 --> 00:38:03,730
Rym: Forty one hours is not so long.

730
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,686
Rym: And you're going to get that.

731
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:04,910
Scott: Yeah.

732
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,555
Scott: But how long?

733
00:38:05,595 --> 00:38:07,350
Scott: He didn't know it was only forty one hours.

734
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:09,730
Rym: Now he did because he got stuck.

735
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:10,394
Rym: Here's the thing.

736
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,490
Rym: I don't want to dwell on this.

737
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,423
Rym: We've already gone on long.

738
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:13,789
Scott: Oh, yeah.

739
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:14,295
Scott: We got to keep.

740
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:15,550
Scott: this video was everywhere.

741
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:19,510
Rym: And a lot of people were saying it was fake or it was staged or it was some sort of like.

742
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:21,566
Rym: that's cool, but you couldn't be stuck there for 41 hours.

743
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:29,376
Rym: If you did a little bit of research, this happened once, like in like 1990 something, this is old, but to.

744
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:36,190
Rym: what happened was he was working late on Friday, went for a smoke break, came back up and got stuck.

745
00:38:36,632 --> 00:38:38,749
Rym: No one came back to the building until Monday.

746
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,786
Scott: Well, number one deserves it.

747
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:41,210
Scott: Smoker.

748
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:43,613
Scott: Yeah.

749
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:45,470
Scott: Number two, where was the cell phone?

750
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:47,710
Rym: He left it upstairs because he just went down for a smoke.

751
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,749
Scott: See, I keep my cell phone on me at all times.

752
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,390
Rym: See, I often don't know.

753
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:53,370
Scott: It's about you're getting stuck in an elevator.

754
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,090
Rym: Number three, I have been stuck in an elevator before.

755
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,029
Rym: I was stuck in an elevator for over an hour once.

756
00:38:58,952 --> 00:39:01,130
Rym: Number three, IBM with one of my co-workers.

757
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:04,350
Rym: We're in an elevator ride and it's going down and we're going.

758
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,243
Scott: You want to hurry this up?

759
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:05,610
Rym: It was going.

760
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,750
Rym: The elevator is going down and it stops and we look at each other.

761
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,889
Rym: We're like, no fucking way.

762
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,690
Scott: So you push the emergency button?

763
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:13,074
Rym: No.

764
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:14,189
Rym: And then it goes again.

765
00:39:14,511 --> 00:39:14,773
Scott: Oh, OK.

766
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:20,249
Rym: And then we get off and then I get back in the elevator with the car to go back up by myself and it stops.

767
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:21,338
Rym: And I go, ha ha.

768
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:22,809
Rym: And then it doesn't go.

769
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:26,330
Scott: And you push the emergency button and it didn't do anything.

770
00:39:27,172 --> 00:39:27,878
Scott: So that's the problem.

771
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:28,989
Scott: Those buttons are supposed to do so.

772
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:31,010
Rym: A lot of them just make a bell ring.

773
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,950
Rym: But if no one's around to hear the bell, then you're fucked.

774
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:36,190
Scott: So that's those buttons are supposed to, like, call the fire department.

775
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:37,159
Rym: Most of them don't.

776
00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:37,950
Scott: That's bullshit.

777
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,116
Rym: But most of them don't.

778
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:39,840
Scott: Well, we need to make some.

779
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:41,410
Rym: a lot of the older ones.

780
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:45,575
Rym: They ring a bell outside the building that says, hey, someone stuck in an elevator in this building.

781
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:46,710
Scott: But that's a little better.

782
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,430
Rym: But most no one knows what that bell is.

783
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:52,233
Rym: If I'm walking in Manhattan and I hear a bell ringing, I know I'm just going to walk past the building.

784
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:56,850
Scott: But even so, it's like that button should call the, you know, help.

785
00:39:57,532 --> 00:39:59,690
Rym: Well, it does call help, but they didn't expect anyone to be.

786
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:04,115
Scott: I mean, really, what they could do nowadays is the elevators have a cell phone and you push the button.

787
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:05,569
Scott: It calls, you know, not on one.

788
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:12,130
Rym: Anyway, for all the people who are saying he should have sued the place, the building settled for an undisclosed amount that he accepted.

789
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,509
Rym: So I'm sure he was paid.

790
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,410
Rym: Anyway, this video is pretty cool.

791
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:16,139
Rym: What do you got?

792
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:16,830
Scott: All right.

793
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:18,489
Scott: So Will Eisner.

794
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,131
Scott: Right.

795
00:40:19,191 --> 00:40:25,188
Scott: We we've yet to talk about Will Eisner, mostly because the first Will Eisner book that we must read is at my grandma's house.

796
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,770
Scott: Good to get it back to my grandma.

797
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:38,930
Scott: There'll be plenty of Will Eisner action, which is it's kind of sad that it hasn't been Will Eisner action, seeing as he's the greatest comic creator to ever live with only Tezuka coming close with a tie or a second place.

798
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:39,552
Scott: It's hard to tell.

799
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:44,753
Scott: Anyway, Will Eisner, when he joined the military in the World War Two times.

800
00:40:44,914 --> 00:40:45,095
Scott: Right.

801
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:47,310
Scott: And he mostly did comics for the military.

802
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:59,969
Scott: And afterwards, when he had his own comics company after leaving the military, talking, you know, from the early 50s to the 60s and such, he was still, you know, had the military was one of his clients.

803
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:03,550
Scott: And he made a magazine called Preventative Maintenance Monthly.

804
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:11,490
Scott: And here on this blog are many images and scans of Preventative Maintenance Monthly.

805
00:41:11,712 --> 00:41:13,670
Scott: And it is quite awesome.

806
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:17,443
Scott: And you can see the the epic comic power that is.

807
00:41:17,504 --> 00:41:29,529
Scott: Will Eisner and his amazingness even doing, you know, a lame military comic telling you to change the oil in your Humvee or whatever and not let Greece get on rubber because it'll ruin it.

808
00:41:30,852 --> 00:41:34,329
Scott: He still manages to make some of the greatest comics there ever were.

809
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:35,792
Scott: All right.

810
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:36,375
Scott: All right.

811
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:44,235
Rym: So so anyway, before we get on to the main bid, Scott announced this contest intermittently for a while and then he kind of kept forgetting to mention it again.

812
00:41:44,256 --> 00:41:45,510
Scott: Yeah, I have been lax.

813
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:54,529
Scott: I think maybe that's why we get so few entries for contests and we're so unsuccessful with them is because despite, you know, saying we're going to do contests right, everyone else, you know, fucks them up.

814
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:55,770
Scott: We never do them right.

815
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:58,190
Rym: So well, you never do them right.

816
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,288
Rym: I'm smart and just don't do them.

817
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,554
Scott: Yeah.

818
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:04,854
Scott: So I think the other thing is that so we either we either don't do them or do them poorly.

819
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,449
Rym: I think it's more that we asked a lot.

820
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:10,070
Rym: I mean, most of the entries we got patently didn't follow the rules.

821
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:10,680
Rym: So screw them.

822
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:11,069
Scott: Yep.

823
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,122
Scott: Well, I have about.

824
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,130
Scott: basically we had a contest.

825
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:22,350
Scott: The contest was for the three volumes of the Goon Saga manga, which is a side story to the actual Goon Saga published by Vertical in English.

826
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:24,061
Scott: It's the entire thing.

827
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:24,930
Scott: It's only three volumes.

828
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:25,793
Scott: We have all of them.

829
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:32,809
Scott: And the contest was to write an essay saying why we should give them to you and, you know, to not screw up that essay.

830
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:36,432
Scott: And basically, no matter how good your reasons were, if you screwed up the essay, we didn't count it.

831
00:42:37,295 --> 00:42:46,150
Scott: And, you know, I didn't get that many submissions, but there were a handful of valid ones and I've been lazy, but I finally evaluated all of them.

832
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:50,740
Scott: And the winner is Mr.

833
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:57,629
Scott: Roboto, who is from Costa Rica, mostly because his essay was valid and he lives in Costa Rica.

834
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:05,610
Scott: Therefore, it's probably best that someone in Costa Rica gets this manga because they probably can't buy it easily.

835
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:06,987
Scott: And he also has a U.S.

836
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,133
Scott: address, which is very nice because I can send it with normal shipping and then he'll get it somehow.

837
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:18,529
Scott: I don't know how that works, but maybe I should get a Japan address and then I could buy Japanese video games and such and they would be sent to me.

838
00:43:19,455 --> 00:43:20,569
Scott: I want to figure out how that works.

839
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:22,249
Scott: I'm pretty interested now.

840
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,054
Scott: But yeah, Mr.

841
00:43:24,094 --> 00:43:30,613
Scott: Roboto, you should email me your address and then I will send you mangas for free.

842
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,688
Rym: You should probably also follow up with him via email.

843
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:36,795
Scott: Yeah, probably.

844
00:43:37,016 --> 00:43:39,129
Scott: I could do that, too, if he doesn't listen to the show.

845
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:49,329
Rym: But anyway, on to actually reviewing some anime here on gig nights, Wednesdays, the quote unquote award winning anime podcast that doesn't talk about anime enough.

846
00:43:49,993 --> 00:43:50,215
Rym: Yeah.

847
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:51,649
Rym: Part of that's because Scott doesn't watch any.

848
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:52,948
Scott: I've been reading books.

849
00:43:54,155 --> 00:43:56,490
Rym: I didn't say anything other than that.

850
00:43:58,038 --> 00:43:59,989
Rym: You don't watch so much anime, do you?

851
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:02,670
Scott: It's video game and book season.

852
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:03,435
Scott: Yeah.

853
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,150
Rym: OK, so you don't watch so much anime.

854
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:05,832
Scott: Not lately.

855
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:10,450
Scott: Lately I've been watching more because it's starting a new anime season.

856
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:16,530
Rym: But anyway, tonight we're going to talk about something pretty quickly because it's a fairly short kind of one off thing.

857
00:44:17,414 --> 00:44:20,070
Rym: And I highly recommend it, but not for the reasons you might expect.

858
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:23,730
Rym: We talk about Marius the Chojo.

859
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:24,411
Scott: Right.

860
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:26,848
Scott: Not show, Joe, but Joe Joe.

861
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,810
Rym: It's kind of like if a show Joe means girl, Joe Joe means Supergirl.

862
00:44:31,191 --> 00:44:41,891
Rym: This was actually released originally by CPM as the Supergirl or the Super Gal, and they were kind of sued because of Supergirl and were forced to rerelease it under a different name.

863
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:51,118
Scott: But anyway, the deal is Rumiko Takahashi of Ranma slash Uruze Yatsura slash etcetera fame.

864
00:44:51,138 --> 00:44:51,790
Scott: Right.

865
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:57,010
Scott: She made a short story, a very short manga story about Marius the Jojo.

866
00:44:57,392 --> 00:44:57,653
Scott: Right.

867
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:00,310
Scott: And Emily said she read that manga and owns it.

868
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:01,770
Rym: But it's like 10 pages long.

869
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,868
Rym: It's like this happy little.

870
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:03,941
Rym: Yeah, let's go.

871
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:04,327
Rym: The end.

872
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:04,851
Scott: Right.

873
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:06,830
Scott: We haven't read it, though, but we know it exists.

874
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:10,910
Rym: And she said, oh, that thing that's like this 10 page funny comic.

875
00:45:11,153 --> 00:45:11,822
Rym: We should watch it.

876
00:45:11,863 --> 00:45:12,390
Rym: It'll be short.

877
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,384
Rym: There's not much to it.

878
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,750
Scott: Well, is it an OAV or a TV movie?

879
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:17,749
Rym: It's OAV, I think.

880
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:18,172
Scott: All right.

881
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:21,150
Scott: So it's basically a one shot OAV, one episode.

882
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,970
Scott: So it's sort of like a short movie.

883
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:24,509
Scott: Was it like 40 minutes, something like that?

884
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,294
Rym: I don't even know.

885
00:45:25,314 --> 00:45:26,240
Rym: It was late and I didn't.

886
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:27,709
Rym: I wasn't sure how long it was going to be.

887
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:28,969
Scott: Wasn't as long as the movie.

888
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:35,770
Rym: But I'll say this, much like a lot of other anime from that era of when I'm watching anime, it wasn't that long.

889
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:36,883
Rym: It was, in fact, only 45 minutes.

890
00:45:37,931 --> 00:45:41,390
Rym: But it felt interminable.

891
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,790
Rym: It felt pretty long to steal a term from Dave and Joe.

892
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:50,130
Rym: Kind of like how you watch Vampire Hunter D. And it's not that long, but it feels like it's super long.

893
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,470
Scott: I think what it is, a lot of the scenes sort of drag.

894
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,790
Scott: It's like there'll be a scene and there's not much plot.

895
00:45:56,891 --> 00:45:59,049
Scott: I mean, they only had 10 pages of manga to go on.

896
00:45:59,310 --> 00:45:59,410
Scott: Right.

897
00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:05,710
Scott: But to fill up 45 minutes, like they would get to outer space and then they'd like a big scene.

898
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:06,846
Scott: Like when they're in the desert.

899
00:46:06,927 --> 00:46:07,130
Scott: Right.

900
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,009
Scott: They're in the desert on some planet.

901
00:46:09,712 --> 00:46:12,510
Scott: And it was just like a really 10 minutes of walking in the desert.

902
00:46:12,954 --> 00:46:14,170
Scott: And I was like, come on.

903
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:17,182
Rym: Except it was actually only like a minute or two, but it felt like.

904
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:19,230
Scott: it felt like they were all going to the desert forever.

905
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:21,450
Scott: And there's the beach scene, which is the scene.

906
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,015
Scott: Awesome.

907
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:22,990
Scott: It's just awesome.

908
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:23,754
Scott: You're awesome.

909
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,530
Scott: It felt like it was five minutes long.

910
00:46:25,631 --> 00:46:27,469
Scott: Just watching crazy shit on the beach.

911
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:38,329
Rym: But first, this was actually directed by, of all people, Kazuyoshi Katayama, who, among other things, went on to direct the Big O. Big O. It's Showtime.

912
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:39,310
Scott: Awesome.

913
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,050
Rym: And he was actually I didn't realize this.

914
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,269
Rym: He was the assistant director for Nausicaa Valley of the Wind.

915
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,070
Scott: All right.

916
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,087
Rym: And a bunch of other stuff.

917
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,548
Scott: But it's a pretty important anime person that not many people have heard of.

918
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,878
Rym: Maurice the Chojo is about.

919
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:56,210
Rym: it's about a girl who's from a planet that was blowed up.

920
00:46:56,871 --> 00:47:01,670
Rym: And everyone on that planet has seven times the strength of a normal human.

921
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:05,690
Scott: I imagine it's probably one of those things where the planet had seven times the gravity.

922
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,168
Scott: So everyone is super strong there.

923
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,130
Rym: I don't know if it would even be addressed.

924
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:18,870
Scott: The thing is, she's super strong in outer space also, which, yeah, it was not one of those things where they explain it, where, you know, a science fiction nerd would be satisfied.

925
00:47:19,091 --> 00:47:24,670
Rym: But because she's super strong, she wears these restraints most of the time, because otherwise she busts stuff up and gets in trouble.

926
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:31,690
Scott: Like if she just walks around without restraints, like she'll just her step will smash the floor, which is not too good in a spaceship.

927
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,669
Scott: It could mean a certain doom.

928
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,330
Rym: So what problems does she face?

929
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:40,010
Rym: Well, one, she's poor and that's pretty much it.

930
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:40,909
Scott: That's pretty much.

931
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,210
Rym: And she wants to not be poor anymore.

932
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,590
Scott: That's pretty much typical anime fare.

933
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,790
Scott: I mean, in outer space, no money.

934
00:47:47,911 --> 00:47:49,170
Scott: Can we bebop anyone?

935
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,749
Scott: I mean, how many times have we seen this?

936
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:59,110
Rym: Now she has her kind of copilot and friend is this little kitsune who is hilarious.

937
00:47:59,290 --> 00:47:59,989
Scott: He's pretty funny.

938
00:48:00,471 --> 00:48:02,482
Rym: And the plot is basically she's.

939
00:48:02,522 --> 00:48:03,890
Scott: I don't know why he hangs out with her, though.

940
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:04,433
Scott: He should.

941
00:48:04,454 --> 00:48:06,190
Rym: But he comes out constantly complains.

942
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,288
Rym: Why do I hang out with you?

943
00:48:07,774 --> 00:48:08,665
Rym: But he doesn't go away now.

944
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:14,690
Rym: But the plot is that it starts out and there's this kind of action scene where she beats up a bunch of people.

945
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:18,970
Rym: And I was worried about what kind of show this was because she beats up everyone.

946
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:25,489
Rym: But there's one guy who's wearing like a power suit and he's like, oh, like, I'm awesome and I will defeat you.

947
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,283
Rym: But then we put Scott's like, is that?

948
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:30,810
Rym: did he pee himself?

949
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:31,741
Rym: No, it can't be.

950
00:48:31,782 --> 00:48:32,310
Rym: And we're watching.

951
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,609
Rym: It's like, no, that's just like some waters.

952
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:35,273
Scott: I can't.

953
00:48:35,314 --> 00:48:36,549
Scott: I completely forgot about this.

954
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:41,630
Rym: And then it cuts to her and she's like, wow, he's so afraid.

955
00:48:41,971 --> 00:48:44,069
Rym: He's so afraid, despite all appearances.

956
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,066
Rym: And we're like, was that actually intended to be P?

957
00:48:47,086 --> 00:48:47,770
Rym: to convey that?

958
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:58,590
Rym: And not only is that indeed P, not only did he pee all over himself, but the P is there like in inordinate amount.

959
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,310
Rym: Like you see it so much in every like it's highlighted.

960
00:49:02,512 --> 00:49:03,137
Rym: It's there.

961
00:49:03,158 --> 00:49:04,530
Rym: The guy peed himself.

962
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,290
Scott: This is this is pretty much a wacky show.

963
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:11,910
Scott: It's just as very simple, sort of dragon half cut.

964
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:15,550
Scott: If you want to drag and have only a little crazy, you want an analogous show.

965
00:49:15,934 --> 00:49:16,989
Rym: It is Project Aco.

966
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,110
Scott: Project Aco is also very analogous.

967
00:49:20,011 --> 00:49:26,650
Rym: The deal is eventually she gets a job to save some guy who was kidnapped and the guy is super pretty.

968
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:30,410
Rym: So she decides any super sounds like dragon have to be all right.

969
00:49:30,772 --> 00:49:32,468
Rym: I'll save him and then he'll marry me.

970
00:49:33,212 --> 00:49:36,070
Rym: And I don't care what he's like because I'll be I won't be poor anymore.

971
00:49:36,811 --> 00:49:40,670
Scott: And plus, she's got a family who has the same problem she does, that they're super strong.

972
00:49:40,992 --> 00:49:44,350
Scott: But her dad's drunk and her mom's stupid, I guess.

973
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,550
Rym: And she goes to save him.

974
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:49,150
Rym: But it turns out that he's being protected by this evil guy who's just char.

975
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:55,450
Rym: And then this other girl who's basically Biko and she is three times the strength of a normal human.

976
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:59,609
Rym: But it turns out they were both wrestlers and it just goes crazy from there.

977
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:06,450
Rym: And what this really is, is a vehicle for a million cameos and side jokes.

978
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:07,550
Scott: The beach scene.

979
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:13,030
Scott: It's never more evident than in the beach scene and in the the the the cantina scene.

980
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:15,088
Rym: Basically, yeah, the Darth, the Mos Eisley.

981
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,309
Rym: So basically, Darth Vader's huff and paint.

982
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:17,752
Scott: All right.

983
00:50:17,773 --> 00:50:19,609
Scott: So first, I'll discuss the beach scene.

984
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:25,250
Scott: They there's one part in which they they taxi someone to the beach as a ploy to get money.

985
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:29,629
Rym: So say it, Emily, this is like one page and that's it.

986
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:36,490
Rym: But instead, they drag it out into this almost music video montage of all these scenes of the beach.

987
00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:37,910
Rym: And it's actually really funny.

988
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:41,970
Scott: Yes, it's basically, you know, they get to the beach and then they just this camera.

989
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:46,230
Scott: They show you all these just scenes happening on the beach while this music plays.

990
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:51,830
Scott: And you see such things as other Rumiko Takahashi characters hanging out on the beach, under the water, et cetera.

991
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:54,910
Rym: All of them, like you see Ten and Lum and Ataru and all these people.

992
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,552
Scott: Right.

993
00:50:55,572 --> 00:50:59,310
Scott: You see a battleship under the sea shooting.

994
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:09,190
Rym: You see, there is a strange undertone where it's obvious like you watch this and it's like, wow, this giant war is just starting.

995
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,690
Scott: You see an alien invasion of mechanical space alligators.

996
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:20,330
Rym: The Dinobots are marching out of the ocean and right next to them, everyone's just hanging out on the beach, totally ignoring them.

997
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:27,890
Scott: It's really weird because this giant like it's like there's an alien invasion of bat of old and new battleships in space and undersea.

998
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:32,210
Scott: And, you know, cyborgs and robots and aliens and God knows what.

999
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,570
Scott: But all the people on the beach are hanging out.

1000
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:44,710
Scott: It's like if you took an anime about a horrible alien invasion and took an anime about hanging out on the beach, being happy, and you just put the cells one on top of the other and didn't.

1001
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:47,590
Scott: And the two things, the two worlds didn't actually collide.

1002
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,410
Rym: The best part is the guy who's scuba diving.

1003
00:51:50,714 --> 00:51:51,329
Scott: No, definitely.

1004
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:55,330
Rym: Because he kind of there's this big blue thing and spoilers, I guess.

1005
00:51:55,691 --> 00:52:01,270
Rym: And he's like, he's swimming toward it and he kind of pokes his head in the hole, is looking around and suddenly clamps around him and it eats him.

1006
00:52:01,471 --> 00:52:03,890
Rym: Well, it's like it clamps around him and you wait.

1007
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:04,915
Rym: And I'm like, ha ha.

1008
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:07,650
Rym: And then it goes like, oh, now he's totally inside.

1009
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:10,210
Scott: So he just got eaten by a creature on the bottom of this.

1010
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,510
Rym: Now, that's funny in and of itself.

1011
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:17,550
Rym: But then a second later, like with perfect comedic timing, his bones pop out, it burps and these bones pop out.

1012
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:18,550
Rym: And it's just hilarious.

1013
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:23,610
Scott: Not only is it funny that the bones pop out with comedic timing and a little burping noise.

1014
00:52:24,232 --> 00:52:28,530
Scott: The actual the way the bones are drawn is really funny.

1015
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,869
Scott: I like bones, but they're really cute.

1016
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:36,167
Rym: There's a similarly long scene with the desert, but I guess what I would say about the desert.

1017
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:44,270
Scott: So at one point they crash on the desert and it's the girl and the and Maurice and the fox walking around the desert.

1018
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:49,870
Rym: By the way, while it kind of works, the kitchen is a total jackass asshole.

1019
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:50,392
Scott: Yes.

1020
00:52:50,874 --> 00:52:55,410
Scott: So in that one, two characters crash spaceship walking around the desert.

1021
00:52:55,531 --> 00:52:57,070
Scott: And I'm like, Star Wars.

1022
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,649
Scott: I even said Star Wars out loud.

1023
00:52:59,071 --> 00:52:59,372
Scott: Right.

1024
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:04,190
Scott: While we were watching it, they arrive at sort of a shady ghost town.

1025
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:06,730
Scott: I'm like, most easily I say it out loud.

1026
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,850
Rym: And then we immediately see Darth Vader huffing paint.

1027
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:12,870
Scott: There's Darth Vader huffing paint and there's an R2D2 in the background.

1028
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:14,649
Scott: And I'm like, I fucking called it.

1029
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:16,367
Scott: How more obvious could they be?

1030
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:20,721
Rym: But if I was going to say anything about this show, it wouldn't.

1031
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:23,810
Rym: it's not necessarily a great show in and of itself.

1032
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,968
Rym: No, not really what it is.

1033
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:37,690
Rym: And it really gave me the same vibe I got when I was in fourth grade, when I was like eight or nine years old and I was seeing my first anime and I would watch any anime I could get and shows from that era.

1034
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:53,270
Rym: Like shows like that where there's these long kind of dragged out musical number scenes and there's this goonie kind of humor that that the style of goonie humor in modern anime is a lot different from the style of goonie humor from this older anime.

1035
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:59,950
Rym: And I don't know, this is the best show to show to a whole bunch of people at once.

1036
00:54:00,512 --> 00:54:03,650
Scott: As the best show to hold a bunch of people in that genre.

1037
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,150
Scott: It's a great show to show to a whole bunch of people.

1038
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:08,570
Rym: I think it's up there with Elf Princess Rain.

1039
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,450
Scott: It is definitely right up there with Elf Princess Rain.

1040
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:21,970
Scott: It's just Dragon Half, Echo, all those sort of wacky sort of semi one shot adventure thingies to have a fun time with.

1041
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:31,450
Rym: But these are wacky in the older school way as opposed to like Excel Saga and all those kinds of things which are wacky in this kind of completely different way.

1042
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,870
Rym: Not saying one is better or worse, but it's a different kind of wacky.

1043
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:38,970
Scott: Yeah, it's the old school wacky and I liked it, but I don't know if I'd watch it again.

1044
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:50,310
Rym: But the real vibe I got and Emily got the same vibe and Scott even did to a degree was watch this show if you're in the same frame of mind to watch like Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

1045
00:54:51,111 --> 00:54:58,530
Scott: Yeah, definitely the late night quiet kind of weird action enhances it in a different way than the large crowd does.

1046
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,270
Rym: Yes, but I think both are good.

1047
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:05,390
Rym: I mean, if you run an anime club show this, it'll go over really well.

1048
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:11,110
Scott: I got people yelling and screaming and oh my God, they can get over the fact that it looks old, which I never actually heard any.

1049
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:16,050
Scott: You know, I hear old school anime fans complain, hey, kids don't look at stuff because it looks old.

1050
00:55:16,652 --> 00:55:20,390
Scott: And I've never actually heard anyone say I'm not watching this because it looks old.

1051
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,830
Rym: The only people I've ever heard say something like that were people who aren't anime fans.

1052
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,770
Rym: They're Naruto only fans or they're Bleach only fans.

1053
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,110
Rym: People who are like just getting into anime, they've only seen like the Dragon Ball.

1054
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:31,786
Rym: That's all they like.

1055
00:55:32,631 --> 00:55:35,810
Rym: Yeah, but anyone who watches anime, no, I've never heard Dragon Ball looks old.

1056
00:55:36,311 --> 00:55:37,809
Rym: Yeah, Dragon Ball does look old now.

1057
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,489
Rym: Yeah, I didn't realize how old it looked till I saw some the other day.

1058
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,530
Scott: It's also really poorly drawn that Mario's the Jojo is better looking than Dragon Ball.

1059
00:55:45,311 --> 00:55:46,229
Rym: Mario's the Jojo.

1060
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:53,730
Rym: If you have an anime club, show it and talk it up as this old school event and people will yell and scream and they'll stop.

1061
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,370
Rym: They'll be kind of bored during the desert scene.

1062
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:56,427
Rym: They'll be like, what's going on?

1063
00:55:56,815 --> 00:55:57,550
Rym: Where is this going?

1064
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,330
Scott: And the desert scene, it actually starts to get serious for a little bit.

1065
00:56:01,871 --> 00:56:05,470
Scott: And like a few times it sort of tries to be serious, kind of.

1066
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:10,210
Rym: But it does it in that old school like Slayers where it's like, we're going to be serious.

1067
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:10,850
Scott: Just kidding.

1068
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:14,569
Rym: Yeah, but all that desert scene is, is just set up.

1069
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:27,643
Rym: If you have a crowd for when they see Darth Vader, even if it's not that funny in and of itself, if you've got a crowd of anime fans in a room having been set up with this desert scene and suddenly they see Darth Vader, they're going to go,

1070
00:56:27,806 --> 00:56:27,908
Scott: ah!

1071
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:29,307
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

1072
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:30,689
Scott: All right.

1073
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:34,410
Scott: That was a little bit of a long show, but I guess it makes up for no show yesterday, right?

1074
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:34,823
Rym: Yeah.

1075
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,590
Rym: And we'll probably do a show tomorrow.

1076
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:43,490
Rym: There's a tiny chance we might do a special or something quick because I'm actually going to Rochester for Toricon, which might be the last.

1077
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,470
Scott: Aren't you going Friday?

1078
00:56:45,271 --> 00:56:47,450
Rym: Yeah, but I got to pack and get ready Thursday and sleep.

1079
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,110
Scott: I'm going to have a new computer tomorrow.

1080
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:49,541
Scott: Yeah.

1081
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:56,470
Rym: So basically what I had to put together and what I'm trying to warn all of you is that I might want to go to bed early and hang out.

1082
00:56:57,052 --> 00:57:04,930
Rym: And much like when I got my new computer and suddenly there were a couple of non-GeekNights because, oh, Rym's got to do something.

1083
00:57:05,573 --> 00:57:08,430
Rym: Maybe I think Scott's feeling the desire to build his computer.

1084
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,930
Scott: Maybe we could do something like special.

1085
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:13,050
Scott: I'm thinking maybe.

1086
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,090
Rym: I think we should do a special.

1087
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,749
Rym: The Thursday specials are always fun.

1088
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,130
Rym: People seem to enjoy them almost more so than a normal Thursday.

1089
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,010
Scott: I'm kind of thinking, right?

1090
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,230
Scott: This might be spur of the moment.

1091
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,745
Scott: I don't know if we want to say it on the show, right?

1092
00:57:22,692 --> 00:57:30,789
Scott: I don't know if you haven't discussed this with you beforehand, but maybe we could do something crazy like we Skype a listener and talk for 15 minutes and that's it.

1093
00:57:31,635 --> 00:57:32,470
Rym: That might be interesting.

1094
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:33,409
Rym: Depends on the listener.

1095
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:35,645
Rym: I know I kind of want to listen to that.

1096
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,507
Scott: I know we're like, sure, Betts.

1097
00:57:37,831 --> 00:57:39,648
Rym: I kind of want to Skype like Daryl Surratt.

1098
00:57:40,552 --> 00:57:44,310
Rym: I mean, like, hey, Daryl, let's talk about something that isn't anime or video games.

1099
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:47,388
Scott: Well, you could do like a 15 minute geek profile or, you know, something like that.

1100
00:57:48,351 --> 00:57:52,650
Scott: So I guess people are probably going to comment on that saying, pick me, pick me in the forums, right?

1101
00:57:53,413 --> 00:57:54,430
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure they will.

1102
00:57:54,531 --> 00:57:55,077
Scott: I'm sure they will.

1103
00:57:55,603 --> 00:57:56,270
Scott: Well, maybe we'll do it.

1104
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:56,679
Scott: Maybe not.

1105
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:56,988
Scott: We'll see.

1106
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,168
Rym: But anyway, the New York Comic Con was OK.

1107
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:07,690
Scott: TM Revolution was the fucking bomb and hopefully explosive, hopefully a very small bomb with a very large explosion.

1108
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:08,950
Rym: He's like a neutron bomb.

1109
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,250
Scott: He's really small.

1110
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:11,189
Scott: Oh, my God.

1111
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,650
Scott: He's so energetic, so small.

1112
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:21,930
Rym: Normally with someone who's famous, you expect at some point that grin to turn into the slightly forced grin.

1113
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:27,590
Rym: I mean, as like game face as I am at conventions, because people see me at cons.

1114
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:34,790
Rym: I'm up there like, yeah, and then I get to the room and it's like my face goes from the smile to like the frown before I fall asleep and snore and like die.

1115
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:43,290
Rym: But every now and then my visage cracks and visage and famous people, it cracks because they have even more pressure.

1116
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:45,730
Rym: But I didn't see a single crack in this guy.

1117
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:49,450
Rym: Maybe he might be a robot, a very small robot.

1118
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,049
Rym: He might be a robot.

1119
00:58:51,557 --> 00:58:52,370
Scott: He's a very small robot.

1120
00:58:54,212 --> 00:58:55,970
Scott: During the show, the show's got to be over now.

1121
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:56,929
Scott: It's done.

1122
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:57,530
Scott: It's done.

1123
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,160
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1124
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,760
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1125
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:20,640
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map and links to all the RSS feeds.

1126
00:59:21,262 --> 00:59:26,900
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1127
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,999
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1128
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,580
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games and RPGs.

1129
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,540
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1130
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:46,060
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1131
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,600
Scott: Just click the link that says send me an Odeo on the right side of our website.

1132
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:55,120
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

1133
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,460
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website, which has everything.

1136
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,920
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1137
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:19,480
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
