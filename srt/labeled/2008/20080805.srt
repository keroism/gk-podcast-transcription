1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,124
Scott: It's Tuesday, August 5th.

2
00:00:11,405 --> 00:00:11,966
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:12,828
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:14,491
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:18,539
Scott: Tonight, DS, Homebrews, and ROMS.

6
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,800
Rym: Well, hello, ConnectiCon, or at least all the people who came to the GeekNights fold after seeing us at ConnectiCon.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,350
Scott: Yeah, you know, ConnectiCon wasn't that big.

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,500
Scott: I guess it had more people than last year, at least it felt like it did.

10
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:49,760
Rym: It's hard to say because Friday was real weak, but then Saturday busted out more so than I would have imagined.

11
00:00:50,801 --> 00:01:03,120
Scott: But this ConnectiCon, more so than any con before, really felt like we had a big connection with our existing listeners, as well as people who became fans of us at the con, or at least as far as I could tell.

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,407
Rym: Well, I think what happened was, I mean, a lot of you probably came to that 8 a.m.

13
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:22,680
Rym: match game and discovered- Yeah, but because we didn't actually run the match game, well, we did, kind of, but we basically just kind of hung out at the front of the room for two hours.

14
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:27,310
Scott: Yeah, and they're not going to give us celebrity guests.

15
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,320
Scott: A match game can only be an hour, really.

16
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,900
Rym: Granted, had we known we weren't going to have guests, we might have had something more ready to go than we did.

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,804
Scott: Well, I would have rescheduled.

18
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:38,647
Scott: I would have changed it.

19
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:40,012
Scott: I would have had it not be a match game.

20
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,320
Scott: I would have done something else, and I would have only done it for an hour.

21
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:53,000
Rym: Yeah, but I can say one thing, it must have worked well, because pretty much every panel throughout the day had a bunch of people who went to the previous panel, and then some new people.

22
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:05,420
Scott: Yeah, I mean, at every panel I announced what our remaining panels were, and people seemed to actually pay attention, and I guess they wrote it down or circled it on their schedules or something, because I saw the same faces many times throughout the day.

23
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:10,995
Rym: Now, before we go any further, I do want to point out, because I'm sure many of you, you know, you went home, you went, "Oh yeah, that GeekNights thing,".

24
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:13,000
Rym: and now you're listening to this, the most recent episode.

25
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,486
Rym: GeekNights is four nights a week, and this is GeekNights Tuesdays.

26
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:25,880
Rym: So, you know, Mondays, Science Tech, Tuesday, gaming, which a lot of you are probably here for the gaming after the Burning Wheel events.

27
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:26,779
Scott: Yeah, it was great.

28
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:34,760
Rym: But many of you are probably here for GeekNights Wednesdays, Anime Manga Comics, so stay tuned tomorrow night when we'll have our actual coverage of ConnectiCon.

29
00:02:36,443 --> 00:02:38,254
Rym: And GeekNights Thursdays, we talk about whatever.

30
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:39,200
Rym: That's kind of the fun time.

31
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:45,500
Scott: It's kind of weird, though, to do the ConnectiCon coverage tomorrow, because most of the con was gaming action.

32
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,100
Rym: I know.

33
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:57,580
Rym: But anyway, the other thing is that GeekNights is four nights a week, but this summer we're currently on our sabbatical schedule, so we're actually doing, like, one week Monday-Wednesday, the other week Tuesday-Thursday.

34
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:01,208
Rym: So basically, it's four separate shows, and they update.

35
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,753
Rym: You can look at the feeds on the website, figure them all out.

36
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:06,760
Rym: If you got this far, you probably know how podcasts work.

37
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,320
Scott: Yeah, but this week we're going to do a Tuesday-Wednesday, just a little bit weird, because the way the conventions are.

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,160
Scott: Yes, also- After, in September, things should return to normal.

39
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:16,702
Scott: Yes.

40
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:23,040
Rym: Now, these might be slightly atypical episodes, too, just tonight and tomorrow, because one, we were at ConnectiCon last weekend.

41
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:31,540
Rym: Two, tomorrow night we were packing up, and then Thursday morning we're driving to Baltimore for Oticon, where we were doing another five panels.

42
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:45,980
Scott: Yeah, so if you want to listen to some more typical, run-of-the-mill GeekNights episodes, go back a few weeks, a few months, maybe go on the site and search for a topic that interests you, or check the categories on the left.

43
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,664
Scott: Maybe you'll find something you like.

44
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:53,000
Scott: Listen to a show about something that you already enjoy, and then you'll know if this is a show you want to listen to.

45
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:09,520
Rym: But to not continually tick off all the existing listeners with every time we go to Oticon, we talk about- Yeah, and granted, at least from what I saw at ConnectiCon, it was surprising that- It's like making a guy who's beaten the game sit through the tutorial.

46
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,180
Rym: But I got to say, an anime you should see, that's usually an event where we don't expect our existing listeners to go to it, because they know what we're going to say.

47
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,365
Rym: But there were a lot of you in that audience.

48
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:28,180
Rym: I guess we've done big con things, but we haven't done big con things as GeekNights.

49
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,844
Rym: We've kind of been doing these panels.

50
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:31,147
Rym: that's just, "Yeah, we do this panel,".

51
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:36,080
Rym: but this time, the first time, we were like, "Hey, we are GeekNights," and there's a lot of you out there.

52
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,520
Rym: It's kind of scary to see that many fans in one place.

53
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,160
Scott: Yeah, it's like some people are forum listeners, but there are people who just listen, and they went to the con.

54
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,260
Scott: In fact, almost everyone- They never went in the forum or emailed us or anything.

55
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,115
Rym: Almost every person who came up to us was like, "Oh my god, I listen.

56
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:52,778
Rym: I've been listening for

57
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:53,160
Rym: years.".

58
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:54,468
Rym: I'm like, "Yeah, so who are you in the

59
00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:54,729
Rym: forum?".

60
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:56,017
Rym: They're like, "Uh, I don't post in the

61
00:04:56,057 --> 00:04:56,339
Rym: forum.".

62
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:57,005
Scott: Yeah.

63
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:58,340
Scott: Oh, anyway.

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:13,720
Rym: Yeah, but the one thing I got to say is it was something else to be- it's our last panel of the night, the Beyond Dungeons and Dragons, which, by the way, for all you new listeners, we are doing that exact same panel, only for real, at the Penny Arcade Expo.

65
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Scott: I don't see how the one we didn't do wasn't real.

66
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:18,360
Scott: Well, it'll be- And the one we did already wasn't real.

67
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,519
Rym: It'll be for a much larger audience, I guess.

68
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,720
Scott: Yeah, other than that, it'll be mostly the same.

69
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:23,642
Rym: Mostly the same.

70
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:28,414
Rym: I'm going to have a better example than a hammer and a nail versus a hammer and a bust.

71
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,397
Rym: that's Seinfeld.

72
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:30,540
Rym: I don't know where I was going with that.

73
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,765
Rym: But, yeah, we're doing that at the Penny Arcade Expo.

74
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:42,320
Rym: I highly recommend, if you happen to be going to the Penny Arcade Expo at the end of the month, or I guess the beginning of next month, the end of the month.

75
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,060
Scott: Yeah, it's Labor Day weekend.

76
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,561
Scott: Yes.

77
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:52,693
Rym: And Saturday, August 30th, from 6 to 7 in Satellite Theater Room 307.

78
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:56,840
Rym: Anyway, but it was something to, you know, the panel before us is running out of the lake.

79
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,784
Scott: I hope that, if it's Saturday night, I hope it doesn't conflict.

80
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:06,180
Scott: I mean, I'm going to this con and I'm doing one panel, so really, most of the other time there, I'm going to be trying to enjoy the con, and I got some things I want to do.

81
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,023
Scott: I want to go to the opening keynote.

82
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:09,806
Scott: I want to go to the concert.

83
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:13,812
Scott: I want to go to, you know, Gabe Draws, Hot Dog Fairy.

84
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:16,196
Scott: Maybe I want to see the Omega-thon final.

85
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,820
Scott: You know, there are certain things that happen at PAX that I want to do.

86
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,875
Scott: I hope Saturday night that our panel doesn't conflict with, say, a concert or something.

87
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,420
Scott: That would suck the ass.

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,114
Rym: I haven't looked at all, but anyway, it was, you know, we go in the room and the person before us is going a little long, and we're, you know, in the room like, "All right, what are we doing?

89
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:32,896
Rym: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

90
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:33,858
Rym: Laptop out, getting

91
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:34,159
Rym: ready.".

92
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:41,020
Rym: And then we walk outside the room to see the situation and to see all of you people lined up all the way down the hallway.

93
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,729
Scott: Yeah, it's like we had a line and the panel that was in there had five people, and they were giving us guff.

94
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,693
Scott: I'm like, "Look, we got like a hundred people.

95
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:47,736
Scott: You got like five people.

96
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:49,199
Scott: You can just stop your panel.

97
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:49,380
Scott: No

98
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,480
Scott: one.".

99
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:56,580
Rym: Yeah, but the other shout out I want to give is that, you know, Alex was doing Birding Wheel demos for pretty much the entire time.

100
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,542
Scott: And he got mad bored.

101
00:06:57,602 --> 00:07:02,073
Scott: Well, he didn't get mad bored, but he was a little, "Eh," because he only brought the sword.

102
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:03,556
Scott: He didn't bring any other scenarios.

103
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,100
Scott: He was doing the same thing over and over again.

104
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,800
Rym: But at the same time, every sword went completely different.

105
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:09,186
Scott: I ran a sword.

106
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:10,311
Scott: Everyone was amicable.

107
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:11,296
Scott: I was like, "What the fuck?

108
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:11,717
Scott: Why are we

109
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,200
Scott: amicable?".

110
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,300
Rym: He ran one at the same time, and like everyone drew swords within about 30 seconds.

111
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:20,160
Scott: I got some plans the next time I played the sword.

112
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,740
Rym: I got to say, though, the elf was doing surprisingly well overall.

113
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:25,922
Scott: I don't know.

114
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:28,520
Scott: I thought I heard that like all the elves got chumped except for one.

115
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,711
Rym: Well, one elf went out in a blaze of glory.

116
00:07:30,731 --> 00:07:32,440
Scott: I think that counts.

117
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,080
Scott: Well, there was a rat that got set on fire, right?

118
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,864
Rym: Yeah, that was also a blaze of glory.

119
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:47,179
Rym: But to all of you who played Birding Wheel games at ConnectiCon because you saw our panel or you heard us talking about it, I hope you're listening because we talk about Burning Wheel kind of often now.

120
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,319
Scott: Go to burningwheel.com.

121
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,060
Rym: Yeah, and also, Luke Crane, just in case, he's going to be at the Penny Arcade Expo.

122
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,760
Scott: Is he really?

123
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,240
Scott: Yes.

124
00:07:55,922 --> 00:08:02,714
Rym: In fact, we're probably going to take the crowd, if we can, from the Beyond Dungeons & Dragons panel directly to Mr.

125
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:05,839
Rym: Luke Crane, who will probably run a demo.

126
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,900
Scott: So he did confirm he was going to be there?

127
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,281
Scott: Yes.

128
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:12,119
Rym: I told him, "Yeah, ConnectiCon, blah, blah, blah, panel," and he basically said, "Hot

129
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:12,300
Rym: shit.".

130
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,340
Scott: All right.

131
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,219
Rym: So, yeah, ConnectiCon coverage will be tomorrow night.

132
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,658
Scott: Dun, dun, dun.

133
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,219
Rym: Dun, dun, dun, dun.

134
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,080
Rym: So, yeah, we got any video game news here?

135
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,949
Scott: You want to go News Time?

136
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,678
Scott: All right, here we go.

137
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,323
Scott: Check this out.

138
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:32,360
Scott: So people have been talking, you know, the Virtual Console has been a little weak lately.

139
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:36,198
Scott: I mean, a lot of companies said, "Oh, yeah, our games are coming out of the Virtual

140
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:36,500
Scott: Console.".

141
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,020
Scott: You know what came out of the Virtual Console?

142
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,200
Rym: What came out of the Virtual Console?

143
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,515
Scott: I think it was like Splatterhouse 2.

144
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:42,220
Scott: Not too bad.

145
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,059
Rym: Hey, Splatterhouse 3 is where it's at.

146
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,521
Scott: It might have been 3.

147
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:44,943
Scott: I don't remember.

148
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:50,540
Scott: One of the Splatterhouses and the Sega Master System Sonic the Hedgehog.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,105
Rym: Whoa.

150
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:52,337
Scott: Yeah, pretty bad.

151
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,900
Scott: So, you know, it's been pretty weak over there.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,223
Scott: And then, like, the WiiWare.

153
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:59,412
Scott: I mean, some of the WiiWares were good, like, you know, the Dr.

154
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:02,420
Scott: Mario and the Lost Winds, you know.

155
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,240
Scott: But they put out a lot of their heavy hitters right away, and now they're bringing out the weak sauce.

156
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:16,300
Scott: But next week, the word on the street is that the WiiWare game is going to be Strong Bad.

157
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:18,502
Rym: Ah.

158
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:26,400
Rym: Now, I imagine that this is going to be much like the Penny Arcade game, where the game will probably be alright, but it'll be carried primarily by theme.

159
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,721
Scott: Pretty much.

160
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:36,020
Scott: But, I mean, the thing is, even when, you know, the Homestar guys were doing their vid-electrics, making, like, the Trogdor game and such.

161
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:39,480
Scott: Those games that they made were actually not bad.

162
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,480
Rym: You know, they were better than the average Flash game you play online for five minutes.

163
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,863
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

164
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:51,820
Scott: So, if they make a whole, if they put their resources into making an entire game worth, this could be something worth paying.

165
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,408
Scott: I mean, I haven't paid attention to Homestar in years, you know.

166
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,180
Scott: It sort of became the same joke over and over and lost its funny.

167
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,120
Rym: Kind of like, or at least to us, kind of like the, uh, the Ask A Ninja.

168
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,047
Rym: Yeah, it's like that's- I almost said the Ninja Consultant.

169
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:04,873
Rym: I'm like, "No, that's not it.

170
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:05,658
Rym: That's completely

171
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:05,980
Rym: different.".

172
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,595
Scott: No, but Ask A Ninja, you know, it's like, "I look forward to killing you

173
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:09,199
Scott: soon.".

174
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:17,000
Scott: And it's like, okay, it was funny a whole bunch of times, but then, eventually, it's sort of the same thing over and over again, and I no longer laughed at it.

175
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,288
Scott: And Homestar was the same way, but maybe I'll check this out.

176
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:23,536
Scott: I think it's going to be on PC also, so maybe I'll check the PC action.

177
00:10:23,596 --> 00:10:23,877
Scott: I don't know.

178
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:24,699
Scott: I'll think about it.

179
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:32,800
Scott: But yeah, you should, if you got WiiWare, you might be wanting to consider getting this, even if you're not a Homestar fan.

180
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:35,027
Rym: I remember the time I got WiiWare.

181
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,580
Rym: It all started when I drank 48 glasses of marinade.

182
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,300
Scott: Because if you don't, your Wii might lie dormant for quite a while.

183
00:10:44,400 --> 00:11:01,500
Rym: You know, I love the Wii, and the thing is, though, the DS has been my primary console pretty much since it came out, and nothing- The only thing that distracted me from the DS for any length of time was when I got Civ 4, and for the two days after Team Fortress 2 came out before I solved it.

184
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:04,426
Scott: Yeah, and I said it before on the show, I'll say it again.

185
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:10,820
Scott: It's like, I read comics, I read books, I watch anime, now my iPhone, right?

186
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:14,830
Scott: I play Wii, I do all sorts of geeky things.

187
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,014
Scott: I have a queue of geeky things.

188
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:18,140
Scott: I program stuff, right, on my laptop.

189
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:24,513
Scott: If there's a DS game that's good, everything else takes a back burner.

190
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:37,380
Scott: I don't know what it is about the DS, but it's just- My brain will always have me go for an unplayed, good DS game before anything else, and you're gonna see why that tendency is incredibly dangerous when we get to the real part of the show.

191
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:47,880
Rym: Well, you see, I think what that is, I think that is misplaced game desire from the fa- I mean, back before we were in the real world, you know, when we were in college.

192
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,376
Rym: As in, infinite free time, zero responsibility, no money, so we couldn't go anywhere anyway.

193
00:11:54,396 --> 00:11:55,620
Rym: It's not like I commuted.

194
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,784
Rym: So, I'd wanna play games.

195
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,394
Rym: I would just sit down in front of a console in our house and play games.

196
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:06,340
Rym: I would sit down and play a game, like, all the way through.

197
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,026
Rym: But now I don't have time for that.

198
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:10,880
Rym: I mean, I get home and I gotta do the podcast, I gotta, you know, eat.

199
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:19,320
Scott: See, it's weird, 'cause if a really good Wii game comes out, like a Twilight Princess or a Metroid or something like that, I do sit down and play the whole thing.

200
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:22,310
Scott: It happens, you know, I come home every day and play it.

201
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,300
Scott: But there hasn't been a game like that, really.

202
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:33,700
Rym: Well, see, the other thing is, you get home, your schedule's a little different from mine, and getting up at like 4.30 in the morning really puts a damper on playing games at home when I could be outside.

203
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,960
Rym: Of course, you know, it is also summer.

204
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,973
Scott: It is summer, but you know what, we always say, "Oh, in winter we're gonna play so many

205
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:40,274
Scott: games.".

206
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:41,680
Scott: Then in winter we don't play any games.

207
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:43,626
Rym: Yeah, there were reasons for that.

208
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:47,220
Rym: I mean, we were, the show, we were really kinda doing a lot of GeekNights' work last winter.

209
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:49,799
Scott: Yeah, alright, we'll see what happens.

210
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,680
Rym: It's alright.

211
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:57,740
Rym: I feel as though it is not the DS that is causing the desire to play games, the exclusion of all else.

212
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:06,140
Rym: It is the fact that because we, in particular, have a long commute and aren't home that often, the DS is always there and there's nothing else to distract.

213
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,780
Rym: I mean, think, when you're on the train, I got my laptop.

214
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Scott: But I mean, even if I get a new DS game, like when I got Professor Layton, right?

215
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:17,940
Scott: I would wake up, get on the train, not even listen to my typical morning podcast and play Professor Layton.

216
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:19,503
Scott: I would get to work.

217
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:24,640
Scott: As soon as I walked out the office door, I'd turn it on and play it on my way to the subway, on the subway, on the train.

218
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,420
Rym: But see, it's the same thing for me.

219
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,200
Scott: I got home, I would get home, we would do the show, I would get in bed and play Professor Layton until it was beaten.

220
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,140
Scott: As soon as it was beaten, I put it down.

221
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,582
Rym: But wait, wait, wait.

222
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:34,771
Rym: For me, it's the same thing with anything I get into.

223
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,800
Rym: that's good that I can do portably.

224
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,385
Rym: So when I was watching Bocorato, you know, right?

225
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:46,740
Rym: I would pretty much get off of work, run to the train, sit down, start watching, skipping openers and closers, watch as much as I could.

226
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,667
Scott: But I only really do it for DS games.

227
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,640
Scott: I guess I did it for The Prince of Nothing also, but I only really do it for DS games.

228
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,820
Scott: Like, even if I have an amazing anime, I won't do it.

229
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,700
Rym: You said not a few days ago you were doing it a little bit for Evangelion when you were relaunching it.

230
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,444
Scott: Yeah, but I wasn't watching Evangelion at home.

231
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:05,928
Scott: It was only on the train only.

232
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,112
Scott: Not home.

233
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:10,160
Scott: It wasn't as strong as a DS game is.

234
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:16,300
Rym: Plus, you don't have the ultra immersion of Civ 4 destroying your life like I do right now.

235
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,860
Scott: I was playing the Civ Revelation Revolutions.

236
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,319
Rym: Yeah, Civ Revolutions is a different game.

237
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:21,900
Scott: It is a different game.

238
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,724
Rym: I'd say it's a completely different game.

239
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:30,240
Rym: Now, they're very similar, and I'm not saying that one is more fun than the other one, but Civ 4 is definitely not the same game.

240
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,859
Scott: No, I didn't say they were the same game.

241
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:35,899
Rym: Yeah, and I actually have been feeling the Civ 4 drive madly.

242
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,027
Rym: But I gotta talk a little bit about it.

243
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,260
Rym: Now, we talked not too long ago about this.

244
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,400
Rym: Diablo 3 is coming out, and all the fans of Diablo, basically...

245
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,930
Scott: You're not doing the news we have to do?

246
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,319
Scott: I'm gonna have to do another news.

247
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,783
Rym: Oh no, we'll get to that.

248
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:56,260
Rym: I gotta talk about this, because there's some screenshots, and this epitomizes everything I hate about the internet.

249
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:07,599
Rym: So people saw what Diablo 3 is gonna look like, and people who have never played Diablo before, because they're either younger than us, or smarter than everyone who played Diablo back when it came out...

250
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:10,148
Scott: Well, they're not smart.

251
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,680
Scott: I mean, never having played Diablo doesn't make you smart.

252
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,539
Rym: I think it does.

253
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,559
Scott: Never going to play Diablo makes you smart.

254
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,446
Rym: But they saw, "Oh, Diablo.

255
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:19,752
Rym: Oh, it's based on some old game.

256
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:21,037
Rym: Oh, it looks like, wow, the

257
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:21,278
Rym: end.".

258
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,576
Rym: But people who had played the old Diablos looked at it and said, "Wow, those graphics are way too good.

259
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:27,138
Rym: Fuck

260
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:27,378
Rym: them.".

261
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:28,379
Rym: Yeah.

262
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,320
Rym: And that bothers me a lot, but here's the deal.

263
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:41,840
Scott: I mean, I'm usually the kind of person who says graphics don't matter, that gameplay is more important as long as the graphics uphold the game.

264
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,940
Rym: But I tend to disagree a little bit in that very good atmosphere and very good graphic and immersion design can cover for a lot of gameplay design.

265
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,409
Scott: Yeah, but it's mostly the design, not the image quality.

266
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:53,754
Scott: There's the two very different things.

267
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,382
Rym: But there's a line.

268
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:03,580
Rym: Eternal Darkness was an okay game that was made much, much better just because of the style and everything.

269
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,220
Rym: But if the graphics had been too much worse than it was, they couldn't have pulled off the style in the first place.

270
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,500
Scott: It would have looked like those old walk around with tank controls games and polygons.

271
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:14,923
Scott: You know what?

272
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:16,859
Scott: When you played those games way back in the day...

273
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,040
Rym: They weren't immersive at all.

274
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:18,639
Rym: Yeah, they were.

275
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,579
Rym: I guess if you were stupid.

276
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,061
Scott: No.

277
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:22,361
Scott: Like Half-Life 1, just as immersive as Half-Life 2.

278
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:26,559
Rym: Half-Life 1, I don't think you understand the level of bad graphics I'm talking about.

279
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,800
Rym: I'm talking about third person view of an 8 polygon man in a 16 polygon world.

280
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,280
Scott: Okay, that's a little different.

281
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,380
Rym: Anyway, so a bunch of fans decided to put together screenshots of what the game should look like.

282
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:41,811
Scott: Uh huh.

283
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,030
Rym: And on the left, one, this is shit grammar.

284
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:49,419
Rym: How it looks like, how it should look like.

285
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:50,340
Scott: Great.

286
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,079
Rym: That is bad.

287
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:57,120
Rym: But on the left, I see a game that looks incredibly polished and it looks kind of like "wow" and it looks really, really good.

288
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:05,440
Rym: On the right, I see it looks like they just turned the saturation of the colors down, turned the contrast down, made it dark.

289
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,664
Scott: Well, because that's the thing.

290
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:11,240
Scott: They're not complaining about the image quality of the graphics.

291
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,223
Rym: They were a little.

292
00:17:12,486 --> 00:17:14,380
Rym: One of the complaints was there's colors.

293
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:14,881
Scott: Right.

294
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:15,663
Scott: Well, that's the thing.

295
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:20,917
Scott: is that Diablo, if you play Diablo 2, Diablo 2 is the only one I've played.

296
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:21,560
Scott: I've never played one.

297
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,228
Rym: By the way, it's a terrible game.

298
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:25,420
Rym: It was a terrible game when it came out.

299
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,450
Scott: Click, click, click, click, click.

300
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:27,420
Scott: We're done with that.

301
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:28,879
Scott: The first level.

302
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,129
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

303
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,500
Rym: No, it was a great game.

304
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:37,420
Rym: It was the perfect implementation of Ground Pound Down, I guess.

305
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:49,740
Scott: So, the first level is a city, is a little village at night with the surrounding woodsy grassland, you know, towns and caves that are all dark and evil.

306
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,059
Scott: And there's evil people all about.

307
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:56,816
Scott: Level 2, I think, was a dark, evil-like rainforest where it rained.

308
00:17:56,897 --> 00:17:57,860
Scott: I don't remember exactly.

309
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,100
Scott: Then, you know, the final level was hell where it was dark and fiery.

310
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:08,260
Scott: And every level was, you know, nighttime, dark, raining, hell, fire, brimstone, everything evil and dark.

311
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,927
Scott: And the game had that kind of mood.

312
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:15,720
Scott: And if you add colors to it, they're not complaining it looks too good.

313
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,323
Rym: They're complaining.

314
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:23,460
Scott: it doesn't look, it doesn't have the same dark and evil all the time feeling that the old Diablo had.

315
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,540
Rym: See, at the same time, that feeling came mostly for the fact, you know, just design limitations that they had.

316
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,040
Rym: Not so much as...

317
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,377
Scott: Well, yeah, but they, you know, that's...

318
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:37,258
Rym: And two, I mean, a lot of the complaints, like, people were, like, the things people were complaining about basically did boil down to.

319
00:18:37,338 --> 00:18:38,080
Rym: it looks too good.

320
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,540
Rym: A lot of people were complaining that it was anti-aliased and that it looked smooth and that the animations were, like, smooth and didn't chop.

321
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,220
Scott: Yeah, well, that's, well, that is, you know, someone saying it's too good.

322
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,090
Scott: But it seems like the majority of the people are saying, "Why are there bright colors?

323
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:56,020
Scott: Diablo should be dark and evil and look like hell and bad things all the

324
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,120
Scott: time.".

325
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,160
Rym: Now, the game designer and a lot of smarter people came back and said, "One, these are mostly still screenshots.

326
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,380
Rym: And if you played the game the way it looks in these fan-made screenshots, it would basically be unplayable.

327
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,220
Rym: And the game, the way they designed it is that way because that way you can actually play it.

328
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,999
Rym: And it's a fun game and it might be slightly

329
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:15,180
Rym: more.".

330
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,332
Scott: Wait, wait, how is it a fun game?

331
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:18,920
Scott: It's still going to be... Well, that's what they're claiming.

332
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:20,360
Scott: Oh, yeah.

333
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,618
Rym: It's not going to be a fun game.

334
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,260
Scott: A lot of people will think it's a fun game.

335
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,874
Scott: They like, wow, they like Diablo.

336
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:25,600
Scott: It's the same thing.

337
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,412
Scott: It's like they made Diablo 3.

338
00:19:28,412 --> 00:19:30,240
Scott: I'm going to guarantee you this right now.

339
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:38,760
Scott: It's basically going to be, right, a set of, you know, wow instances that you could play single player or multiplayer without a wow account.

340
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,200
Scott: And it's going to be the most incredibly polished wow instances to ever exist.

341
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:45,198
Scott: And that's all it's going to be.

342
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:52,040
Scott: So if you like doing a wow raid or whatever, Diablo 3 is going to be the most polished wow raids in the universe.

343
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:53,287
Scott: That's all it's going to be.

344
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:55,380
Scott: It's going to be click, click, click on the bad guys and eventually you win.

345
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:02,979
Rym: You know, I can't think if there's any other video game or board game or role playing game news.

346
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:09,135
Rym: I mean, nothing else really happened except for the fact that PAX is coming to the East Coast in 2010.

347
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:09,497
Rym: Oh my fuck.

348
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,142
Rym: Oh my fuck.

349
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:18,880
Scott: I mean, this is a news we kind of knew already, sort of, because they said it at MIT and they said it at some other places.

350
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,191
Scott: But I got to talk about this.

351
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:20,798
Scott: Oh my fuck.

352
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,523
Scott: They're dropping.

353
00:20:21,563 --> 00:20:23,936
Scott: But now they're like, OK, official announcement.

354
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:24,800
Scott: Fine.

355
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,486
Rym: Yeah.

356
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:27,993
Rym: They haven't said where yet.

357
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,159
Rym: However, I have an educated one.

358
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,120
Rym: It's been they're having it run by Reed Exhibitions, the people who did, you know, the New York Comic Con, the New York Anime Festival.

359
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,553
Scott: And oh, comics, anime, gaming.

360
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:38,539
Scott: They got a trifecta.

361
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:46,640
Rym: The reason behind that is pretty much they don't have the time, the resources, the energy or any of that to deal with doing another PAX on the East Coast.

362
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,320
Scott: Kevin, could you run two cons of that size a year on your own news?

363
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,620
Scott: People have a hard enough time running Otakon once a year.

364
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,880
Scott: Maybe a little hard enough time running KatsuCon once a year.

365
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,323
Scott: You know what?

366
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,319
Rym: If I didn't have a day job, I think I could.

367
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:07,360
Scott: If I didn't have a day job, which is exactly why Reed Exhibitions is a good help, because their day job is run the conventions.

368
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:15,659
Scott: Gabe and Tyco still have to make a comic every day, make merch, do the child's play, do the PAX one, do everything else they do.

369
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:19,340
Scott: So they don't really have time to do two conventions.

370
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:26,078
Rym: Because we found out about this for real at ConnectiCon, so of course at every panel we did, we're like, "By the way, PAX East

371
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:26,399
Rym: Coast.".

372
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:28,720
Scott: Thanks to my iPhone, I found out about it.

373
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,878
Rym: And everyone kept asking us, "So where's it going to

374
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:30,959
Rym: be?".

375
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:45,500
Rym: So in case anyone hasn't figured this out or is smart enough to look around and do some research, or if you're just not familiar with the East Coast, there are really only three, at most four places it could conceivably be.

376
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,993
Scott: Well that's assuming Northeast.

377
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:47,719
Scott: If you went...

378
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,481
Rym: No, no, no.

379
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:49,884
Rym: I'm assuming all.

380
00:21:50,065 --> 00:21:57,140
Rym: Because Northeast, or at least Middle North, like the middle of the East Coast, are the only viable places.

381
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,340
Rym: If it's further south, most people aren't going to bother.

382
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,755
Scott: Yeah, I mean, you can go to North Carolina area.

383
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:05,260
Scott: That's about as south as you can go.

384
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:14,500
Scott: If you go more south than that, you pretty much have to go down to Atlanta or Orlando to get a convention center.

385
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:19,160
Rym: Because most of these people coming to those counties, even in the south, are coming from the north anyway.

386
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,581
Rym: But here's the deal.

387
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:26,973
Rym: In my professional opinion, it can only be in either D.C.

388
00:22:27,074 --> 00:22:29,999
Rym: and their convention center, Baltimore at the BCC...

389
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,579
Scott: Which is the place where Otakont is.

390
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,460
Rym: It could conceivably be in Hartford, Connecticut, which wouldn't be the worst place.

391
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,360
Scott: That's not big enough.

392
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:38,058
Rym: No, it isn't.

393
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,838
Scott: Not even close.

394
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,520
Rym: That's why that's like the fourth string.

395
00:22:41,322 --> 00:22:43,540
Scott: It could be in Boston before it was in Hartford.

396
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,840
Rym: No, they'd probably go for Hartford before Boston.

397
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,637
Scott: I don't think so.

398
00:22:47,421 --> 00:22:50,136
Rym: I'm talking about based on how far people are willing to travel.

399
00:22:50,156 --> 00:22:50,619
Rym: Because remember...

400
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,779
Scott: Yeah, I'm talking about the space.

401
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,207
Rym: No, I'm talking about all the factors.

402
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:55,291
Rym: Because there are other factors.

403
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:57,880
Rym: I mean, how many people do they actually expect to attend?

404
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:00,237
Scott: I think there's going to be 30,000 plus people.

405
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,625
Rym: Scott, you're not letting me finish.

406
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:02,288
Rym: I do too.

407
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,400
Rym: I don't think they're going to expect that many people.

408
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:06,039
Scott: I think they know how many people are going to come.

409
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:13,720
Rym: No, I do not think that they expect that the East Coast Packs would, in its inaugural year, have more people than the West Coast Packs.

410
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,060
Scott: I think that they must expect that the East Coast Packs will have more than the West Coast Packs.

411
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,045
Rym: Now, why would they?

412
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:21,900
Rym: I don't think that they know anything about East Coast inventions.

413
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,359
Scott: Because they have Reed Exhibitions doing, helping them out.

414
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,537
Rym: But they just announced... They probably said, "Reed, do our

415
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:30,060
Rym: convention.".

416
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:30,543
Rym: Reed said,

417
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:30,946
Rym: "Okay.".

418
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:32,436
Rym: And Reed's doing the... They don't care.

419
00:23:32,497 --> 00:23:32,859
Rym: They don't know.

420
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,540
Scott: No, they seem to say that they had a lot of say in what's going on and Reed is just doing the logistics for them.

421
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,529
Rym: Yes, but at the same time, they wouldn't know.

422
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,440
Rym: And Reed doesn't even really know.

423
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,140
Rym: Because Reed, they're probably going to want it to be in the Javits, which is probably the worst possible place it could be.

424
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,267
Scott: That's a really bad idea to put in the Javits.

425
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:54,460
Scott: I mean, I guess it has enough floor space for the exhibition hall.

426
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,187
Rym: No, there's no hotels for people to stay in.

427
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:57,854
Rym: There's no easy way to get to the Javits.

428
00:23:58,135 --> 00:23:59,380
Rym: It would be a shitty con.

429
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:00,979
Scott: It would be a very shitty con.

430
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:05,192
Rym: But the thing is, that's probably one of the few places it could be.

431
00:24:05,554 --> 00:24:07,379
Rym: And there's a decent chance that's where it might end up.

432
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,140
Scott: Just because Reed Exhibitions is in love with that building.

433
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,989
Rym: But seriously, it can only really be in

434
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:13,551
Rym: D.C.,

435
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:16,000
Rym: Baltimore, or New York City.

436
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:20,340
Rym: And honestly, if I were them, I would put it in the Baltimore Convention Center.

437
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,263
Scott: I also would.

438
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:25,617
Scott: Because Otakon takes up that whole building and they have almost 30,000 people.

439
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:32,937
Rym: Plus, by 2010, the giant expansion to the BCC will be done, which is going to allow Otakon to expand to 30,000+ easily.

440
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,500
Scott: Yeah, I think PAX could definitely use that entire building.

441
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:42,700
Scott: If you look, instead of the dealer's room, they would have the exhibition room that could fit in there.

442
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:44,900
Scott: Plus, plenty of room for everything else.

443
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,227
Rym: Forget all the logistics and everything.

444
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,193
Rym: The D.C.

445
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:48,440
Rym: Convention Center is big enough.

446
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,860
Rym: But it's also, for the kinds of cons that these are, a really bad layout.

447
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:56,674
Rym: The Javits is almost as bad, but the D.C.

448
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:57,720
Rym: Convention Center just wouldn't cut it.

449
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,540
Scott: Because the Javits is really only designed for the one big room kind of con.

450
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,680
Scott: If you have the auto show, it's a big room with big displays.

451
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,923
Rym: Well, there's more to it than that.

452
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:12,220
Rym: I mean, anime and gaming cons have a lot of hotel to convention back and forth traffic.

453
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,712
Rym: They have a lot more internal foot traffic.

454
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,180
Rym: They have a lot of bursts of traffic.

455
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,739
Rym: They have a lot of people hanging out in hallways.

456
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,140
Rym: It's a totally different thing from every other kind of convention in the world.

457
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,040
Rym: And the BCC is one of the few convention centers that really, really deals with it well.

458
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:33,720
Scott: Yeah, just because it has so many, you know, it's wide, it's got hallways, it's got lots of separate rooms.

459
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,180
Rym: It's got multiple paths to get to most places.

460
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,740
Scott: Yeah, it's got, you know, hotels are across the street directly.

461
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,900
Rym: Also, the BCC's escalators hold out better than any con center I've ever seen.

462
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:47,099
Scott: Yeah, you can walk to a place to eat.

463
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:49,279
Rym: Well, that's starting to change.

464
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:53,190
Scott: It is, but actually I was reading that some new places opened up.

465
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,780
Scott: There's apparently a Chipotle next to the Hard Rock.

466
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:58,700
Rym: Ah, but there's no Fuddruckers anymore.

467
00:25:58,942 --> 00:25:59,200
Rym: Nope.

468
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,880
Rym: May it rest, may it burn in hell.

469
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,698
Scott: I'm going to eat at that Chipotle at least once.

470
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:06,095
Rym: But yeah, PEX, 2010, East Coast.

471
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:12,280
Rym: We work with Reed Exhibitions a bit because, you know, New York Comic Con, New York Anime Festival.

472
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:14,680
Rym: So, we'll see if we can get some sort of scoop.

473
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:16,980
Scott: Oh, we're going to be scooping it up, there's no doubt.

474
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:24,420
Rym: I'm also going to try to talk to everyone involved and at least make my opinion known because, seriously, I think Baltimore is the best choice.

475
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,560
Rym: And I think that the Javits would really fundamentally hurt PAX East Coast.

476
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,239
Scott: I think if they had it in the Javits, it would bomb and then they might not do it again.

477
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,924
Rym: But here's my prediction.

478
00:26:34,165 --> 00:26:38,740
Rym: If it were in the Baltimore Convention Center in, say, May, that's probably the best time.

479
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,240
Scott: Yeah, definitely you want to do it April/May because that way it won't conflict with pretty much anything.

480
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:46,810
Scott: Don't put it in August with the other cons.

481
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,600
Scott: That's just making a mess of everything conflicting.

482
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,980
Scott: Go May when there's no other conventions going down.

483
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,680
Scott: Sure, the kids are still in school a little bit, but it's on the East Coast so they don't have to go very far.

484
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,771
Rym: I would wager it would get 28,000 people.

485
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:03,220
Rym: That is like the number I would put out as my number.

486
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:05,381
Scott: I'd say it could be as high as 35.

487
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:06,407
Rym: It could be, but I'm guessing 28,000.

488
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:07,111
Rym: That is my absolute guess.

489
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:10,440
Rym: It could be higher.

490
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,200
Scott: I'm guessing actually 30+ definitely.

491
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:13,938
Rym: I don't know.

492
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:21,500
Scott: I don't think you understand how many people on the East Coast are like, they hunger for the petty arcade action and they haven't gotten any.

493
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,519
Rym: I know, I know, but I also know there are people who will wait a year.

494
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:26,755
Scott: Maybe.

495
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:33,080
Rym: Plus remember, the East Coast was burned by the first New York Comic Con in a big way.

496
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,045
Scott: But that was a Comic Con.

497
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:36,620
Scott: This is gaming, video gaming on the East Coast.

498
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:46,120
Scott: There hasn't been a gaming convention over here ever and there are lots and lots of video gamers and they hunger, seriously.

499
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,506
Scott: So this is like a brand new thing.

500
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:48,592
Scott: They're going to be like, "Holy

501
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:48,874
Scott: shit!"

502
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:50,060
Scott: and poop their pants and go.

503
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,759
Rym: Run, coward, run, run, run.

504
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:59,500
Rym: The other thing is that there is someone out here that they could tap in a big way if they're down in DC or Baltimore.

505
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,024
Rym: Me?

506
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:01,738
Rym: Other than us.

507
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,459
Rym: It's the dude who supplies the classic arcade cabinets.

508
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,200
Rym: To Katsucon.

509
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,860
Rym: Every year, we hang out in the video game room in Katsucon, we're staffed there, we do shows, it's a big deal.

510
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,760
Rym: They have an arcade and the arcade has like, root beer tapper and zookeeper.

511
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:24,677
Scott: That video-topia guy, Pax, could actually afford to probably get him to bring every game he has to Pax.

512
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,140
Scott: The thing is, he would need to hire guys to temporarily repair all the machines.

513
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,680
Rym: Pax could cover that.

514
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:31,177
Scott: They could.

515
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:32,560
Rym: That guy's not that expensive.

516
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,400
Scott: He's not, but it would be crazy awesome.

517
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:35,420
Rym: Oh my god.

518
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:37,280
Rym: Yeah, we have to talk.

519
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,139
Scott: If he could set up all his machines at once.

520
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,438
Rym: Yeah, listen.

521
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:48,033
Rym: So, all of you out there, if you happen to know Monsieurs Gabe and Tycho, not to say, "Listen to us, listen to us,".

522
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:51,620
Rym: but we kind of know all the business about running an East Coast convention.

523
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,619
Rym: We could probably help in a big way.

524
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:02,269
Rym: Anyway, things of the day.

525
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,430
Rym: Again, all you new listeners.

526
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,309
Rym: Things of the day is a little bit we do.

527
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,190
Rym: You know it's a late show.

528
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,269
Rym: Late shows have to have bits.

529
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:13,824
Rym: We basically just talk about the funniest, coolest, weirdest, or whatever thing we've seen in the last day or so.

530
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:16,350
Rym: that might be at least somewhat related to the topic of the night.

531
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:17,440
Scott: Yep.

532
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:17,860
Scott: Yep.

533
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,470
Scott: So, should I go first?

534
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:20,389
Rym: I think you should.

535
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:30,370
Scott: This isn't really gaming related, but that doesn't ... Well, unless you're talking about the game of life or the game of don't go to jail or I guess get out of jail free.

536
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,930
Rym: I'm real good at that first game.

537
00:29:33,753 --> 00:29:35,169
Scott: So, this is a video of this.

538
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,570
Scott: Pretty much he's like a defense lawyer, professor.

539
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,630
Scott: I'm not really sure, but he's definitely a defense lawyer type person.

540
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,650
Scott: And he basically gives this ... He talks really fast and I really ... I don't think I like his personality.

541
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,530
Scott: At least the personality, the idea I get of his personality.

542
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:50,659
Scott: Why?

543
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,610
Rym: Do you get the impression that he's a little sleazy?

544
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,290
Scott: I get the impression that he's sort of a fast talking sort of kind of guy.

545
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,908
Rym: He's a lawyer.

546
00:29:58,552 --> 00:29:58,829
Rym: Yeah.

547
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,829
Rym: No offense to all our lawyer friends.

548
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:01,346
Scott: No.

549
00:30:02,132 --> 00:30:05,750
Scott: He definitely seems like he has ... I agree with everything he's saying.

550
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,630
Scott: It's just his personality is a little bit grating.

551
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:18,029
Scott: But anyway, the points he's making are great, which is he pretty much says, "Don't talk to the police under any circumstances, whether you're innocent, whether you're guilty, no matter what

552
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:18,690
Scott: happens.".

553
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,669
Rym: Well, there's one exception though that I do want to bring up, just in case.

554
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,630
Rym: If you're witnessing a crime, you probably want to tell the police what you saw, as long as you're not a suspect.

555
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:31,620
Scott: Yeah, but he's pretty much saying, "Use the Fifth Amendment whenever

556
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:31,800
Scott: possible.".

557
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:39,050
Scott: If you have Fifth Amendment rights, exercise them to the fullest extent, no matter the circumstances.

558
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,370
Scott: Don't say anything unless you have to say something.

559
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,910
Scott: Get a lawyer before you open your mouth about anything, and then talk only to the lawyer.

560
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,930
Scott: And then he goes through a whole bunch of points of exactly why.

561
00:30:50,070 --> 00:31:00,490
Scott: The most interesting point he brought up, actually, that really freaked me out, was we know that a lot of the people on death row, right, were pretty much they didn't do it.

562
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,030
Scott: And then they were later proven to be not guilty by DNA evidence, right?

563
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:21,810
Scott: 25% of those people who were found out later, not just death row, but 25% of the people who were exonerated after the fact because of DNA evidence, were people who confessed because they talked.

564
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,750
Scott: They basically didn't use the Fifth Amendment.

565
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:30,430
Scott: If they had used the Fifth Amendment, they wouldn't have been in jail, and they wouldn't have had to be exonerated by DNA evidence later.

566
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:35,510
Scott: And they could have avoided jail, and their lives could have been great, but they didn't use the Fifth Amendment, so they got fucked.

567
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:47,650
Rym: Yeah, basically it's just that you kind of have to protect your own rights, and because you can't be sure of a police officer in a situation, and because of the way the system is, you really, you've got to hold on to your right.

568
00:31:47,770 --> 00:32:00,110
Rym: I mean, you know, the case in point, the good example of if a police officer wants to search your car, and you say no, you don't consent, and he doesn't have probable cause, but he decides to search it anyway, or demands that you open the trunk, or he's going to shoot it open, or whatever.

569
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:05,728
Rym: You've got to just keep saying, "I'm not going to resist because blah, blah, blah, but I still do not consent to this

570
00:32:05,748 --> 00:32:06,089
Rym: search.".

571
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:06,610
Scott: Yep.

572
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:20,470
Scott: But anyway, the best part of the video, right, is actually, you know, he talks really, I think maybe he's talking really fast, not just because he's a fast talker, but because he doesn't have a lot of time, and he's trying to give this other guy enough time to talk.

573
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:32,789
Scott: And the other guy is actually a policeman, basically, but he's also, he said they don't like the word interrogation, they use the word interview, but he's interrogated.

574
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:43,430
Scott: He says thousands of people, at least hundreds, lots of people, right, or interviewed hundreds or thousands of people over his years, you know, 20 plus years as a police officer.

575
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:50,825
Scott: And he pretty much comes up, and you expect him to be like, you know, disagreeing with the guy who just talked, saying, "Don't talk to the police.

576
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,809
Scott: Well, here's the police to argue with

577
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:52,929
Scott: me.".

578
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:58,680
Scott: And the guy, the cop comes up, and he says, "Everything that the defense lawyer said is absolutely correct.

579
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,063
Scott: Don't say a thing.

580
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:03,309
Scott: Here is how we turn what you say against

581
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:03,470
Scott: you.".

582
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,139
Scott: Because remember, anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.

583
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,466
Scott: There is no way anything you say can help you.

584
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:14,948
Scott: It can only hurt you.

585
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:16,090
Scott: So don't say anything.

586
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,251
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

587
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:18,633
Rym: You want a good example?

588
00:33:18,673 --> 00:33:20,076
Rym: Remember that movie, My Cousin Vinny?

589
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:21,278
Rym: Good movie?

590
00:33:21,718 --> 00:33:22,159
Rym: Remember how?

591
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:29,110
Rym: one of the reasons they convict him is they sit him down, the police officers, and he doesn't know that they're trying to get him for murder.

592
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,874
Rym: He thinks that they sped or something.

593
00:33:30,914 --> 00:33:33,399
Rym: He has no idea why he's in the police office.

594
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,405
Rym: And then the cop's like, "You killed the

595
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:36,765
Rym: clerk.".

596
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:38,349
Rym: And he's like, "I killed the

597
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:38,769
Rym: clerk?".

598
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:42,378
Rym: And then in the courtroom, they read his confession.

599
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:44,243
Rym: It's like, "I said again, you killed the

600
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:44,584
Rym: clerk."

601
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:46,548
Rym: To which he responded, "I killed the

602
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:46,849
Rym: clerk.".

603
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,771
Scott: Yep.

604
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:49,394
Scott: Exactly.

605
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:58,209
Scott: So you should watch these two videos, and I don't know if anyone who's smart enough to be a GeekNights listener will have too many run-ins with the police, other than maybe some traffic tickets.

606
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,893
Rym: Oh yeah, traffic tickets.

607
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:07,209
Rym: We should do a show on how to get out of a traffic ticket, because I've gotten out of about 60% of the ones I've been pulled over for.

608
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:13,004
Scott: The first thing this cop says when he gets up, he says, "People ask me, 'How do I get out of a speeding

609
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:13,304
Scott: ticket?'".

610
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:14,286
Scott: He says, "Don't

611
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:14,708
Scott: speed.".

612
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:27,690
Scott: So yeah, watch these two videos, and in your life, if it ever becomes necessary, hopefully it won't, but if it does, keep your mouth shut and get a lawyer.

613
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:28,436
Rym: Here's the difference.

614
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,507
Rym: Unless you did it.

615
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:30,931
Scott: Well, no.

616
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:33,757
Scott: He says, "Whether you did it or didn't do it, keep your mouth

617
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:33,938
Scott: shut.".

618
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:37,045
Scott: Because look, if you talk to the police, right?

619
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,750
Scott: This is why this video is so great.

620
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,014
Scott: He says, "Look, let's say you did it, right?

621
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:47,148
Scott: Of course you want to plead guilty to get a lesser sentence, because you're not going to get out of it without Johnnie Cochran, right?

622
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:47,829
Scott: If there's a mountain of

623
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:48,210
Scott: evidence.".

624
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,030
Rym: But they won't give you the real plea bargain unless you actually talk to a lawyer who does all the business.

625
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,051
Scott: Right, right.

626
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:57,679
Scott: If you just talk before your lawyer gets there, they're just going to run you through.

627
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:04,090
Scott: If you just keep your mouth shut until your lawyer gets there, then you're going to get to bargain and get your better deal.

628
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,736
Rym: That is game theory for the South.

629
00:35:07,378 --> 00:35:12,290
Rym: But for society, if you did it, confess, asshole.

630
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:13,839
Scott: Yeah, just not right away.

631
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,210
Scott: Wait until the lawyer gets there.

632
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,590
Rym: Do I know how to avoid having run-ins with the police?

633
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,030
Scott: Don't commit any crimes?

634
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,310
Scott: Of course, the thing is...

635
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,466
Rym: Or don't film police officers doing their duty.

636
00:35:22,506 --> 00:35:22,970
Rym: They hate that.

637
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:36,730
Scott: Well, the thing is, right, Rym, you know how we always talk about how basically there are so many laws that pretty much everything is illegal, and if a cop looks at you long enough or drives behind you long enough, they can always find a reason to pull you over no matter what.

638
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:42,965
Rym: I mean, if I, I don't know, murdered a bunch of... Well, I guess if I murdered a bunch of people, I'm crazy, so I'm not going to confess anyway.

639
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:44,730
Rym: I don't really have a good example.

640
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:50,286
Scott: These guys actually talk about how there are so many laws that we can't count them.

641
00:35:50,306 --> 00:35:51,710
Scott: We don't know how many laws there are.

642
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:58,150
Scott: And if you talk, they will go over everything you said, and they will find something illegal every time.

643
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:04,510
Scott: Like, he was talking about people who they got because they had, where they were in possession of lobsters.

644
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:12,370
Scott: Yeah, okay, because pretty much everything is, they can always find something illegal no matter what.

645
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:21,090
Scott: So don't say anything, and you won't incriminate yourself for anything because they don't decide, you know, it's not like you go in and they're like, "We're only looking for robbery if you say you did

646
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,290
Scott: something.".

647
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,599
Scott: No, they're looking for anything.

648
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,969
Scott: If you broke any law, they got you.

649
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:27,789
Rym: So, I have a vidya game-related thing of the day.

650
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,350
Rym: Tribes 2 is like the best...

651
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,089
Scott: Is it the bees?

652
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:32,649
Rym: No, not the bees.

653
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:33,729
Scott: It's not the bees.

654
00:36:33,832 --> 00:36:34,289
Rym: Not the bees.

655
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,250
Scott: So it's not the bees.

656
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,013
Rym: It's not the bees.

657
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:36,958
Rym: Oh my god, what is it?

658
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,165
Rym: Oh my god, what is it?

659
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:38,648
Rym: What is that?

660
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:39,030
Rym: What is it?

661
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:39,848
Scott: It's not the bees.

662
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:40,650
Rym: Okay.

663
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:48,110
Rym: So Tribes 2 is pretty much the best for Team... Stateless... never mind, I'm not going to go into that again.

664
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,344
Rym: Tribes 2 is like the best Team FPS ever made.

665
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:51,950
Scott: It is the best to ever exist.

666
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,890
Rym: It is the best team-based multiplayer stateless capture the flag FPS.

667
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:03,129
Scott: Well, it is all those things, but what non-stateless, non-team-based multiplayer FPS is better?

668
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:03,330
Scott: Nothing.

669
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,669
Rym: Well, I also said capture the flag.

670
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:08,230
Scott: What capture the flag is... What capture the flag FPS is better than...

671
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,907
Rym: Yeah, but I'm saying not because it's a non-capture the flag game.

672
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:11,330
Rym: I don't want to...

673
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:12,350
Scott: It is all those things, but...

674
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,456
Rym: I don't want to compare apples to oranges.

675
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:18,228
Rym: That's like saying, "The Godfather is the best movie or video game ever

676
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:18,549
Rym: made.".

677
00:37:19,151 --> 00:37:20,690
Scott: Well, there is a Godfather video game, I'm saying.

678
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,229
Rym: Not the best video game ever made.

679
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:27,860
Scott: No, but Tribes 2 is the best multiplayer FPS compared to all other varieties of multiplayer FPS.

680
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,055
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

681
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:30,427
Rym: NS is up there, but anyway...

682
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,689
Scott: NS is the second best multiplayer FPS.

683
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,988
Rym: Anyway, Tribes 2 was great, and this video basically shows... You know, the game had vehicles and everything.

684
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:38,450
Rym: I'm not going to talk.

685
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,132
Rym: Just watch it.

686
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:45,230
Rym: if you thought Tribes 2 was awesome, and this shows you a dude who is one of the better Shrike pilots I've ever seen.

687
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,290
Rym: Now, the thing to remember, if you're not too familiar with Tribes 2...

688
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,764
Scott: Go try to pilot the Shrike.

689
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:50,370
Scott: It sucks.

690
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:52,090
Scott: The thing just crashes all over the place.

691
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,654
Rym: Yeah, Tribes 2 could have been made better.

692
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:58,590
Rym: Halo and a lot of games have learned how to do vehicles a lot better, but Tribes 2 did it first.

693
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,723
Scott: Well, it wasn't the first game to ever have vehicles.

694
00:38:01,743 --> 00:38:03,270
Scott: I mean, Half-Life 1 had vehicles.

695
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,477
Rym: Those were not vehicles.

696
00:38:04,517 --> 00:38:06,550
Rym: Those were basically suicide machines.

697
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,470
Scott: They were vehicles.

698
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:16,310
Rym: However, I contend that the vehicles in Counter-Strike in particular were more fun than the vehicles in any FPS today.

699
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,141
Scott: Jeep-a-thon 2K!

700
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,130
Rym: That was like the best map ever.

701
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:20,587
Scott: She gets some of that going on, but anyway...

702
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,790
Rym: Nothing was more fun than being in a Jeep with six other guys, Paris...

703
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,508
Scott: Three other guys.

704
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:36,650
Rym: Yeah, saw a number of guys driving past another Jeep with an equal number of guys all with Paris, shooting at each other, having a ride as time, and then suddenly one of the Jeeps flips over and kills everyone in it randomly.

705
00:38:37,011 --> 00:38:49,230
Scott: Yeah, the point is that Tribes 2, as great as it was, it's an old game from 2000-2001, and the vehicles were busted because that was the best they could do in those days, and they were very hard to pilot.

706
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:54,550
Scott: And here's a video of a guy piloting them like his car.

707
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:05,610
Rym: Now, the other cool thing is that if you're not familiar with Tribes, keep in mind that while these guys are piloting these vehicles all up, they're just dudes around the map fighting on foot at the same time.

708
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:06,147
Scott: Yep.

709
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:08,450
Rym: Anyway, I thought that was pretty cool.

710
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:14,110
Rym: So, we're going to go kind of short because it's late, it's Tuesday, tomorrow night we got a pack for Otakon.

711
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,969
Scott: Yep, so check this out.

712
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:20,850
Scott: I've been looking in the, you know, the DS Homebrew scene for a while, right?

713
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:33,028
Scott: There's all this huge hullabaloo, especially on the other side of the Pacific Ocean about the R4 and these things, but basically... Yeah.

714
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:36,030
Rym: You said hullabaloo, I don't know what the hell you were thinking.

715
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:36,828
Scott: That's fine.

716
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,850
Scott: So, but basically the deal is, is that people know how the DS works.

717
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,610
Scott: The DS is not a complicated piece of hardware, right?

718
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:45,586
Scott: The Nintendo DS.

719
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:49,150
Scott: And it didn't take hackers a very long time.

720
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,849
Scott: I mean, this technology has been around for years.

721
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:59,910
Scott: Basically what they do is they have this card that goes in, it looks like a DS cartridge, but you put a normal microSD memory card in it.

722
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:04,130
Scott: And you put that in your DS and it boots on your DS.

723
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:10,830
Scott: And then your DS can, you can run any software you want in your DS, not just games you buy at the store.

724
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:16,489
Scott: So this includes, you know, technically people write their own software and run it on the DS.

725
00:40:17,353 --> 00:40:18,750
Scott: You can make your own DS games.

726
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,409
Scott: People were doing this in GBA days too.

727
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,650
Scott: They're making their own GBA games and putting them on, you know, flashcards.

728
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:30,510
Scott: They, you can go and download, you know, NES and SNES ROMs and ROMs for other systems too.

729
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:36,330
Scott: Like I guess, you know, Sega Genesis and Master System and I guess maybe Commodore 64, who knows?

730
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:39,189
Scott: And you have emulators that they wrote for the DS.

731
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:44,710
Scott: And then you run these ROMs in the emulator on the DS and it lets you take your NES and SNES games portable.

732
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:53,410
Scott: And also what you can do is you can just put Nintendo DS or Game Boy ROMs on this, on the memory card.

733
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:56,389
Scott: And then just play them on your DS without actually buying them.

734
00:40:57,671 --> 00:41:03,130
Scott: And so I've been curious about these things for a while, but the thing was, is that there were always trouble.

735
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:05,630
Scott: You had to buy like a bunch of separate pieces.

736
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:08,910
Scott: You had to flash your firmware on your DS.

737
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,850
Scott: It was a whole bunch of trouble.

738
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,147
Scott: I didn't want to brick my DS.

739
00:41:12,572 --> 00:41:14,110
Scott: You know, it was a little risky.

740
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:19,529
Scott: I was waiting for sort of the perfect solution, you know, something that didn't stick out the top of the DS.

741
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,928
Scott: Something that didn't cost a fortune.

742
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,570
Rym: Something that didn't completely eat the battery in like 10 minutes.

743
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:24,849
Scott: Well, I'll get to that.

744
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,371
Rym: Yeah.

745
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:32,110
Rym: Well, I guess the answer to the begged question is that now you didn't find a perfect one, not even close.

746
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,090
Scott: Well, it's all going to tell you.

747
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,030
Scott: So at ConnectiCon, I finally broke down and I bought the M3DS Reel.

748
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,730
Scott: I bought sort of like the ultimate one.

749
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,370
Scott: It came with a little micro SD USB reader.

750
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:45,234
Scott: It came with a rumble pack.

751
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:51,830
Scott: It came with a GBA expansion slot and it came with the M3DS, the actual card itself.

752
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:52,172
Scott: Right.

753
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,610
Scott: And the guy was talking it up.

754
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,970
Scott: He's like, yeah, it's all just drag and drop all the stuff onto the memory card.

755
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,269
Scott: And it works is mostly true.

756
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:03,367
Scott: So I get home.

757
00:42:03,448 --> 00:42:03,610
Scott: Right.

758
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,510
Scott: Here's what you got to know about these M3DS Reels or I guess the R4 or any of the other things.

759
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:08,915
Scott: Right.

760
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:09,727
Scott: You get it.

761
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:12,090
Scott: You got to have an SD memory card.

762
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:12,451
Scott: Right.

763
00:42:12,492 --> 00:42:13,790
Scott: I suggest getting a big one.

764
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,266
Scott: I ordered a four gig micro SD because DS games are like 256 megs.

765
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,650
Scott: So if you want to have more than one on there, you're going to need a lot of space.

766
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,870
Rym: Luckily, that sort of memory is getting cheaper and cheaper.

767
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,281
Rym: So these.

768
00:42:25,302 --> 00:42:25,405
Rym: Yeah.

769
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:33,850
Scott: I ordered a four gig micro SDHC from Newegg for, I think, like fourteen dollars, maybe seventeen dollars.

770
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:35,310
Scott: So it's basically nothing.

771
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:36,414
Scott: All right.

772
00:42:36,474 --> 00:42:38,930
Scott: So you get you put the memory card in there.

773
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:39,391
Scott: Right.

774
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:45,470
Scott: And you put it in the DS and it says, you know, well, first, if you don't put a memory card in, it says no memory card.

775
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:46,213
Scott: All right.

776
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:49,970
Scott: So you put the memory card and it says no system files found.

777
00:42:50,532 --> 00:42:54,370
Scott: You have to go online and get the system files and put them on the memory card.

778
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:55,153
Rym: Why?

779
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,570
Scott: That's how it works still.

780
00:42:58,631 --> 00:42:58,832
Scott: All right.

781
00:42:58,852 --> 00:43:02,870
Scott: So you get these system files and you drag this folder onto your SD memory card.

782
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:07,450
Scott: Now the system starts up and the system has a bunch of built in software.

783
00:43:07,991 --> 00:43:16,230
Scott: It has a built in NES emulator, SNES emulator and has media playing stuff or playing music and movies that are converted to the right format.

784
00:43:17,033 --> 00:43:19,650
Scott: It can play and and Nintendo DS and GBA games.

785
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:20,573
Scott: Right.

786
00:43:20,594 --> 00:43:21,782
Scott: But it plays those natively.

787
00:43:21,822 --> 00:43:22,930
Scott: It doesn't emulate them or anything.

788
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:30,670
Scott: It just sort of loads them into the memory of your DS and runs them as if you actually had the cartridge and PDA stuff in there, whatever.

789
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:33,049
Scott: And I tried out all these things.

790
00:43:33,431 --> 00:43:39,470
Scott: You know, I even installed like alternative SNES emulators because really I wanted to sort of get some SNES on the go.

791
00:43:40,511 --> 00:43:44,150
Scott: And while they work, they don't work well.

792
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:50,910
Scott: It really reminds me of sort of the DOS days, not super DOS days because there's a GUI going on and it's a little bit easier than that.

793
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:54,287
Scott: But everything is sort of hackish or not very polished.

794
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,630
Rym: The original GUI interface to Nesticle.

795
00:43:58,191 --> 00:43:59,236
Scott: Yeah, I know it's it's it is.

796
00:43:59,296 --> 00:44:02,750
Scott: it's a lot like the old Nesticle, like the emulators don't work perfectly.

797
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:10,130
Scott: Like in Super Metroid, I had to keep adjusting like the layers of sprites and backgrounds and which ones were on top of which other ones.

798
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:15,110
Scott: Because like Sam, everything would look fine, but then I'd go in a door and Sam was to be on top of the door.

799
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,922
Scott: I'd be like, no, Sam is supposed to be in the door.

800
00:44:17,144 --> 00:44:17,949
Scott: So something's wrong.

801
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:20,161
Rym: So that's even worse than the DOS days.

802
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:21,810
Rym: I didn't really have problems like that often.

803
00:44:21,991 --> 00:44:22,273
Scott: I know.

804
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:24,710
Rym: So except for like like a really crazy Rob.

805
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:25,332
Rym: You know what?

806
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:26,841
Rym: StarTropics.

807
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:28,490
Rym: There's no way that's working now.

808
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:35,190
Scott: But basically, the limitations of the DS hardware make a lot of these homebrew apps less than polished.

809
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,114
Scott: They're not perfect.

810
00:44:36,194 --> 00:44:39,090
Scott: You know, like the PDA stuff and the media playing stuff.

811
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:44,230
Scott: I mean, because I have an iPod and iPhone, actually, that stuff is pretty much useless.

812
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:50,750
Scott: But I could imagine if I was a high school kid and I didn't have an iPhone or an iPod or anything, that wouldn't be too bad.

813
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:51,031
Scott: It would.

814
00:44:51,111 --> 00:44:57,010
Scott: you know, it would be worth my trouble and time to get that working, you know, especially especially if I had a big old SD card.

815
00:44:57,851 --> 00:45:01,321
Scott: But as it is, it's basically subpar.

816
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:04,410
Scott: It's sort of like the Internet on the Wii with the Opera browser.

817
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:10,590
Scott: It's like if you have a computer plugged into your TV, why would you ever use the Wii Opera browser?

818
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:22,270
Scott: But if the Wii is the only thing plugged into your TV and you don't have a computer plugged into your TV, which I imagine is actually the case for most people, even though, you know, you're geeks, you should have a computer plugged into your TV at this point.

819
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:30,210
Scott: The Wii Opera browser becomes sort of useful if you want to watch, look at a web thing, you know, or I guess you can watch YouTube on it, right?

820
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,465
Scott: Does that work now or does it not?

821
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:31,890
Scott: I don't know.

822
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,849
Rym: I haven't even checked.

823
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:34,835
Scott: I haven't used it in forever.

824
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:36,820
Scott: But, you know, that sort of thing.

825
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,610
Scott: It does, you know, if you want to do that, then that's a good way to go.

826
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:43,856
Scott: So it has this PDA and media playing functionality.

827
00:45:44,337 --> 00:45:50,749
Scott: It's really only good if that's the only poor PDA media playing functionality that you have.

828
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,290
Scott: that's portable.

829
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,676
Scott: If you have an iPod, it's useless.

830
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,346
Scott: So the emulating is sort of hackish.

831
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:56,130
Scott: I already said that.

832
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,859
Scott: Another problem with it is that the battery life, it sort of sucks.

833
00:46:00,919 --> 00:46:05,390
Scott: I mean, DS, if you're playing off a real DS cartridge, the battery lasts for like fucking ever.

834
00:46:05,611 --> 00:46:05,752
Rym: Yeah.

835
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:07,342
Rym: Like I'll go days and days and days.

836
00:46:07,402 --> 00:46:08,670
Rym: Then suddenly, oh, my battery.

837
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:09,111
Scott: Yeah.

838
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,180
Scott: I had a fully charged DS this morning.

839
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:13,690
Scott: I played a game for about half the train ride.

840
00:46:14,092 --> 00:46:16,965
Scott: I played it for a little while at work because no one's at work now.

841
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:18,030
Scott: They all went to North Carolina.

842
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,499
Scott: They saw the other tech guys and then I played it on the way home.

843
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:25,590
Scott: And while the battery didn't die, the light was red all the way home.

844
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:26,273
Scott: It was not.

845
00:46:26,514 --> 00:46:27,136
Scott: it was not good.

846
00:46:27,156 --> 00:46:30,310
Scott: I mean, I'm used to having the light green throughout the entire day.

847
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:33,258
Scott: So that that didn't please me very much.

848
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:36,650
Scott: But it did play the game, you know, for as long as I wanted to play it.

849
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,155
Scott: So I guess that that wasn't a problem.

850
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:41,990
Scott: So really, you know, they justify this.

851
00:46:42,311 --> 00:46:48,230
Scott: These, you know, DS homebrew cards saying, oh, we're making homebrew apps, which I can fully support.

852
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:53,646
Scott: And they say, you know, oh, we're taking games that aren't portable, making them portable.

853
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:54,710
Scott: that, you know, we own them.

854
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:55,656
Rym: I'm like, oh, that's not.

855
00:46:55,677 --> 00:46:57,470
Scott: that's justifiable in some way.

856
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,429
Rym: Back in the day, I wanted nothing more than to be able to carry an SNES game around with me.

857
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:01,971
Scott: Yeah.

858
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:07,510
Scott: And this is a lot better than getting one of those guys who took an SNES and put it in a different box that's smaller.

859
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,014
Scott: You know, that's that's unpractical.

860
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:14,270
Scott: So I can sort of support that even though the software that does it is pretty shitty.

861
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:21,450
Scott: The thing is, the only thing this card does well is play DS and GBA ROMs.

862
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,654
Scott: And it does it.

863
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:27,450
Scott: it does it perfectly because it's just taking the software and running it natively.

864
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:31,684
Scott: Like you put a GBA ROM in there and it's as if you had the cartridge.

865
00:47:31,705 --> 00:47:33,210
Scott: You put a Nintendo DS ROM in there.

866
00:47:33,571 --> 00:47:35,179
Scott: It's as if you had the cartridge.

867
00:47:35,279 --> 00:47:37,490
Scott: It is absolutely perfect, except for the battery life.

868
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:39,038
Scott: And it just works.

869
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:40,588
Scott: And yeah.

870
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:48,589
Scott: So on the one hand, I sort of because I've bought a lot of DS games in my day, a lot.

871
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:52,929
Scott: So now that I don't have to buy any DS games because they're basically all free.

872
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,830
Rym: Oh, so you're just going to start pirating everything?

873
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:55,672
Scott: I don't know.

874
00:47:55,692 --> 00:48:01,890
Scott: I'm sort of torn on this situation because on the one hand, it's like, well, I've always been able to afford DS games.

875
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,418
Scott: You know why?

876
00:48:03,438 --> 00:48:05,430
Scott: There's no reason for me to stop buying them now.

877
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:11,990
Scott: And plus, if you buy them, you get the better battery life and the club Nintendo and the club Nintendo and many other things.

878
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,770
Rym: And the box, which you keep an eye long ago, sort of thrown away.

879
00:48:14,971 --> 00:48:15,917
Scott: Yeah.

880
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,669
Scott: There's many reasons to buy this, you know.

881
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:23,950
Scott: But on the other hand, there's a lot of DS games that I sort of glanced at and never bought.

882
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:27,810
Scott: Like I sort of maybe wanted them, but I didn't really want them.

883
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:29,313
Scott: And DS rental.

884
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:37,170
Scott: I mean, I guess, you know, game fly sort of does that and some other places do it, but not really so much.

885
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,490
Scott: I guess you can rent it from Blockbuster, but not really.

886
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:44,289
Scott: So there's some DS games where I kind of thought about buying them and but didn't.

887
00:48:44,731 --> 00:48:48,290
Scott: And there's some DS games where I did buy them and I sort of regret it a little bit.

888
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:49,394
Scott: You know, like dodgeball.

889
00:48:49,414 --> 00:48:50,979
Scott: I mean, we talked about dodgeball.

890
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:53,949
Scott: We did a whole show about it, but we haven't really played it since.

891
00:48:54,572 --> 00:48:55,901
Scott: It hasn't been getting much play.

892
00:48:55,922 --> 00:48:56,888
Scott: I sort of feel like maybe.

893
00:48:57,472 --> 00:49:01,110
Rym: Well, the thing is, the single player game, like any dodgeball, there's no single player.

894
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,570
Rym: And while I want to play a multiplayer, there aren't that many people to play with.

895
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:05,354
Scott: Exactly.

896
00:49:05,394 --> 00:49:07,610
Scott: So it's sort of like I probably shouldn't have bought that.

897
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:12,430
Scott: It was, you know, I didn't have to, you know, and there's some other games I want to try out before I buy.

898
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,610
Scott: And this sort of fills that purpose.

899
00:49:14,811 --> 00:49:17,789
Scott: You know, it's like there's the good and the other thing.

900
00:49:18,351 --> 00:49:19,903
Scott: Here's the real thing about this.

901
00:49:19,943 --> 00:49:20,850
Scott: I'm going to get to in a minute.

902
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:26,430
Scott: Like first I went is a game that's out now called Etrian Odyssey two.

903
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,470
Scott: There was an Etrian Odyssey one for DS that I sort of missed.

904
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,809
Scott: I sort of didn't find out about it until the sequel came out.

905
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:34,970
Scott: And this is sort of a, this game is a double edged sword.

906
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:42,210
Scott: On the one hand, it's this awesome game where you have this giant labyrinth, but you have to draw the map on the touch screen.

907
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,779
Scott: That's fucking awesome.

908
00:49:44,001 --> 00:49:45,190
Scott: So awesome, right?

909
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:46,892
Scott: Problem.

910
00:49:46,913 --> 00:49:51,090
Scott: It's a typical JRPG level up kind of game at the same time.

911
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:52,629
Scott: Not awesome.

912
00:49:52,891 --> 00:49:54,343
Rym: Now we're not going to do a full review of that.

913
00:49:54,363 --> 00:49:55,150
Rym: I got to play it first.

914
00:49:56,091 --> 00:50:01,510
Scott: But Alex actually bought the game and he was playing it and he sort of said basically what I thought.

915
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:07,170
Scott: Which is the maze thing is pretty cool, but there is this dungeon crawling bit.

916
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,649
Scott: But the dungeon, the monsters are actually really hard.

917
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:15,090
Scott: So when I got this little homebrew card for the DS, I went and I got this game.

918
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:20,770
Scott: And actually I'm kind of digging it even though it's got this level up bit because the maze bit sort of outshines it.

919
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:27,090
Rym: I really, I mean the thing I love is the idea that the bosses are not, the bosses aren't like normal bosses.

920
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,669
Rym: I don't want to get into it, but I think it's really cool.

921
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,290
Scott: The bosses are just really annoying.

922
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:30,770
Scott: Really?

923
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:31,122
Scott: But yeah.

924
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,570
Rym: The way Alex described them, I thought they were awesome.

925
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:34,568
Scott: Well, you'll see.

926
00:50:37,572 --> 00:50:41,110
Scott: But basically, you know, I sort of was able to learn that I kind of like this game.

927
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:50,230
Scott: And the reason that I can tolerate this game is because the dungeon crawly bit is less of, there are random encounters.

928
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:55,150
Scott: But it's more a resource management thing and less a grind thing.

929
00:50:55,592 --> 00:50:57,630
Scott: You know, it's like you don't have so much gold.

930
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,110
Scott: You never have enough gold ever.

931
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:00,869
Scott: You never have enough health ever.

932
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:02,490
Scott: You never have enough anything.

933
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:06,089
Scott: So you're basically, you're not trying to beat the monsters to level up.

934
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:11,490
Scott: You're just trying to survive and see as much of the maze as you can.

935
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:14,130
Scott: And the monsters are draining your resources.

936
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:18,490
Scott: And the fights are actually ways to sort of manage.

937
00:51:19,012 --> 00:51:23,150
Scott: You know, you're not trying to beat the monsters effectively, even though it's not a bad way to go.

938
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:31,150
Scott: You're trying to get through and get through the maze and accomplish the quests and things and discover as much labyrinth as you can without running out of resources.

939
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:36,790
Scott: And I was able to learn all this, that I kind of like this game from pirating it, basically.

940
00:51:38,531 --> 00:51:44,830
Scott: The other thing about this that I think is far more justifiable than, you know, straight up piracy of DS games, right?

941
00:51:46,892 --> 00:51:53,490
Scott: Is if you live in the US, you can just go online and download Japanese DS roms and vice versa.

942
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:54,650
Rym: So have you touched any witches?

943
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:57,350
Scott: So of course, I go online.

944
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:58,710
Rym: How do you get the witch touching game?

945
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,830
Scott: I'm like, I got to get me a Japanese DS game.

946
00:52:02,092 --> 00:52:02,569
Scott: A witch to touch.

947
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:10,790
Scott: And of course, the first one that I sort of come across, I don't know why, but of course, obviously, if I'm going to get a Japanese DS game.

948
00:52:11,012 --> 00:52:11,970
Rym: It's going to be a witch touching game.

949
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:15,829
Scott: It's going to be Doki Doki Maho Shinpan 2 Witch Touching.

950
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,810
Rym: So did you touch any witches?

951
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:25,450
Scott: You know, Doki Doki Maho Shinpan, playing it was a lot like playing sort of a Tokimeki without the school sim.

952
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,659
Scott: I walk around, characters talk to me.

953
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:29,810
Scott: There's a whole lot of Japanese text I can't read.

954
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,270
Rym: You did not answer my question.

955
00:52:31,392 --> 00:52:32,010
Scott: I'm not done.

956
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:32,990
Rym: Did you touch any witches?

957
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:33,688
Scott: I'll let you know.

958
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,730
Scott: This is the only thing you all want to know.

959
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:37,729
Scott: Well, you're not going to find out unless you let me tell the whole story.

960
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:46,490
Scott: So I'm playing and you talk to people and there's a whole lot of Japanese text and you watch characters reactions on the screen.

961
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,217
Scott: And, you know, it's all right.

962
00:52:48,277 --> 00:52:49,041
Scott: You're going through.

963
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:51,030
Scott: You don't know what's going on because I don't speak Japanese.

964
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,890
Scott: And there's a lot of kanji in there anyway.

965
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,930
Scott: I can't even not that I can read the hiragana.

966
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,870
Scott: And occasionally they'll give you a choice of three things to say.

967
00:52:59,971 --> 00:53:01,343
Scott: And I'll just pick one randomly.

968
00:53:01,363 --> 00:53:02,069
Scott: that looks cool.

969
00:53:02,674 --> 00:53:03,830
Scott: And the characters will react.

970
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:06,490
Scott: And I keep going around and it's like I go to school.

971
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:09,290
Scott: I touch things, you know, like I look behind things.

972
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,023
Scott: Well, I look behind the blackboard.

973
00:53:11,064 --> 00:53:11,709
Scott: I find a clue.

974
00:53:12,253 --> 00:53:13,870
Scott: It's an investigation game actually.

975
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,790
Scott: You're going around trying to get clues similar to Phoenix, right?

976
00:53:16,932 --> 00:53:18,129
Scott: But not so similar.

977
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:23,147
Scott: And the thing is, I never, I played the game for like a good 30 minutes.

978
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:26,030
Scott: Didn't touch a single witch.

979
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,570
Scott: There was not a single opportunity for witch touching.

980
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:32,190
Scott: So even though this is the witch touching game, you got to play a lot.

981
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,510
Scott: I guess maybe knowing Japanese, I might have been able to touch witches sooner.

982
00:53:36,093 --> 00:53:39,670
Scott: But I did not arrive at a single witch touching situation.

983
00:53:40,271 --> 00:53:41,570
Scott: It was all investigation.

984
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:45,510
Rym: That's a little sad, but at the same time it's oddly comforting.

985
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,229
Scott: Well, I think it's sort of like a porno.

986
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:51,568
Scott: It's like, you know, you get this plot the whole time and there's a sex scene at the end.

987
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:54,129
Rym: But all you want to do is touch a witch.

988
00:53:54,792 --> 00:53:56,830
Scott: I didn't want to actually play this game.

989
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,240
Scott: I can't understand it or anything.

990
00:53:58,261 --> 00:53:59,490
Scott: I'm getting nothing out of playing it.

991
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:04,630
Scott: The only reason I got the game was to basically see what the witch touching was all about.

992
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:05,677
Scott: So I could comment on it.

993
00:54:05,697 --> 00:54:07,450
Scott: But I have no idea what it's like to touch a witch.

994
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,220
Rym: I can tell you exactly what it's like.

995
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,449
Rym: You touch a witch.

996
00:54:11,137 --> 00:54:11,222
Scott: Yeah.

997
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:12,210
Rym: It is witch touching.

998
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:12,851
Scott: Right.

999
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:13,276
Scott: So, yeah.

1000
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,610
Scott: So, I don't know what the final verdict is.

1001
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:22,930
Scott: I mean, I'm sort of torn about the justifiability of just pirating DS and GBA games.

1002
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,810
Scott: I mean, for some of the games I feel it's okay because it's hard to get the games.

1003
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:27,795
Scott: Maybe they're out of print.

1004
00:54:27,815 --> 00:54:30,210
Scott: Maybe they're old GBA games that aren't around anymore.

1005
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:32,470
Scott: You know, it's a little bit more justifiable.

1006
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:36,268
Scott: Just getting Etrian Odyssey 2, beating it and not playing it.

1007
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:37,836
Scott: Feel a little bad.

1008
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:38,862
Scott: Maybe I'll go buy it.

1009
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:40,330
Scott: I'm thinking because I really like it.

1010
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:44,210
Scott: And I sort of, I'm thinking about starting over in the beginning anyway because I sort of fucked up.

1011
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:47,149
Scott: And I didn't know what I was doing early on and I died a lot.

1012
00:54:47,711 --> 00:54:48,410
Rym: Yeah, no manual.

1013
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:49,820
Scott: Yeah, no manual.

1014
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:50,710
Scott: It kind of sucks.

1015
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:59,709
Scott: So, you know, if you have a DS and you're like a high school kid, you should probably totally get one of these things, whichever one you can get your hands on.

1016
00:55:00,472 --> 00:55:12,550
Scott: If you have money, man, you have an iPod, you don't really need one of these things, but you could get it to sort of test the waters of DS and GBA games you're thinking about getting, maybe.

1017
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:14,389
Scott: You know, just sort of test them out.

1018
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:20,507
Scott: If you want to save a lot of money because you're poor, you should probably get one of these and you could have mad fun on your DS.

1019
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:26,370
Scott: I mean, sure, sort of hard to justify the piracy, but whatever, you're poor.

1020
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:32,150
Rym: The real point is there's very little use for these things other than piracy, so don't kid yourself.

1021
00:55:32,571 --> 00:55:33,377
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

1022
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,330
Scott: It's a pirating machine.

1023
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:42,890
Scott: The only things it does well are play DS and GBA games sort of natively, ROMs of DS and GBA games natively.

1024
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:44,479
Scott: It does a lot of other things.

1025
00:55:44,901 --> 00:55:46,450
Scott: It doesn't do them well.

1026
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:51,430
Scott: It does them half acid and hackily, which a high schooler could tolerate.

1027
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:55,470
Scott: Maybe someone without a lot of money could tolerate, someone with an iPod could tolerate.

1028
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:57,174
Scott: I can't tolerate it.

1029
00:55:57,716 --> 00:56:01,870
Scott: I pretty much, you know, I played with it, used every feature on it.

1030
00:56:02,912 --> 00:56:05,510
Scott: I'm pretty much only ever going to use it for DS and GBA games.

1031
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:17,930
Scott: And actually what I did is I went and I downloaded a bunch of old GBA games that are not easily available and I've been trying to play those, you know, games that I would never pay money for and just want to see, like play them for 30 seconds.

1032
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,769
Scott: Like I played Mario Pinball for 30 seconds.

1033
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:20,990
Rym: That's about all that was worth.

1034
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,485
Scott: I played Pokémon Pinball for 30 seconds.

1035
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,009
Rym: I'll bet that was worth the same 30 seconds.

1036
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,106
Scott: Yeah, I played Yu-Gi-Oh, one of the Yu-Gi-Oh games.

1037
00:56:28,186 --> 00:56:28,670
Scott: Bad.

1038
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,149
Scott: You know, that sort of thing, just to see what the deal is.

1039
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:36,130
Scott: And I think it's, you know, it was worth buying the price I paid for it.

1040
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,235
Scott: I think I paid 80 bucks.

1041
00:56:37,295 --> 00:56:37,577
Scott: I don't know.

1042
00:56:37,597 --> 00:56:38,461
Scott: Maybe I got ripped off.

1043
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:39,365
Scott: It doesn't really matter.

1044
00:56:39,406 --> 00:56:40,210
Scott: I could afford it.

1045
00:56:40,491 --> 00:56:40,732
Rym: Yeah.

1046
00:56:41,216 --> 00:56:42,546
Rym: I'm glad I didn't buy it at the con.

1047
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,050
Rym: I'll hold out.

1048
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,949
Rym: I'm going to hold out until the technology gets better, until I can actually use it.

1049
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,870
Scott: Well, that's the thing is that this has been the same technology for a couple of years now.

1050
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,202
Scott: It's not really going anywhere.

1051
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:51,050
Scott: It's sort of leveled out.

1052
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:51,672
Scott: You know what?

1053
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:56,070
Rym: Maybe I'll just install Nesticle or, well, I guess modern emulators.

1054
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:57,286
Scott: Well, what you can do is you can go get...

1055
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,375
Rym: On my laptop.

1056
00:56:58,797 --> 00:57:00,810
Rym: And I'll just play ROMs on my laptop.

1057
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:08,490
Scott: Yeah, you can just totally get a GBA or DS emulator for your computer and plug in a controller and go at it if you don't want to.

1058
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,209
Scott: The only reason to do this is for the...

1059
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:10,690
Rym: Is to touch witches.

1060
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,109
Scott: Is for the DS-ness and the touch screen-iness.

1061
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,290
Rym: And the touching of witches.

1062
00:57:14,637 --> 00:57:14,850
Scott: Yeah.

1063
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:15,795
Rym: I think we're done.

1064
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:17,990
Rym: Tomorrow night, coverage of Kinetic Con.

1065
00:57:18,512 --> 00:57:18,753
Scott: Yep.

1066
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:23,489
Scott: I'm going to try the Wii homebrew soon and I'll give you a report on that after I play with it.

1067
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,349
Rym: You mean a witch.

1068
00:57:25,673 --> 00:57:25,790
Rym: Right.

1069
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,869
Scott: I don't think there's any witch touching on the Wii.

1070
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,719
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1071
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,360
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

1072
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:51,280
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Crapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

1073
00:57:51,882 --> 00:57:57,540
Rym: We say feeds plural because GeekNights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

1074
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,619
Rym: Mondays are science and technology.

1075
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,200
Rym: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

1076
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,820
Rym: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights.

1077
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,159
Rym: And Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

1078
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,699
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com.

1079
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:16,659
Scott: Or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

1080
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,220
Scott: Just click the link that says "send me an Odeo" on the right side of our website.

1081
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:25,740
Rym: If you like what you hear, you can catch the last 100 episodes in iTunes or in your favorite podcatcher.

1082
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:29,080
Rym: For the complete archives, visit the website, which has everything.

00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:42,240
Scott: This means you can do whatever you want with it, as long as you give us credit, don't make money, and share it in kind.

1085
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,540
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1086
00:58:46,962 --> 00:58:50,080
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
