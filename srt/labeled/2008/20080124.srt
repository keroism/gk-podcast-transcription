1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,149
Scott: It's Thursday January 24th.

2
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:12,971
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,717
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight desert bus.

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:29,796
Rym: Let's do this This weekend just couldn't come faster.

5
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:31,522
Rym: I'm tired to put it lightly.

6
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:33,750
Scott: I got like at work.

7
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:38,504
Scott: I had some works to do right and some of the works were Works that I like to do and some were not.

8
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:40,033
Scott: and I've done all the works I like to do.

9
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:44,777
Scott: and now I'm just sitting there with these two pain in the ass works I don't want to do.

10
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,843
Scott: they just suck.

11
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:46,487
Rym: Well, don't do them.

12
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:46,829
Rym: Just quit.

13
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:50,230
Scott: I'm doing them incredibly slowly and mostly goofing off.

14
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:56,315
Scott: The problem is there's not enough new stuff on the internet to keep me amused all day at work And it's getting pretty painful.

15
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,427
Rym: You could get a job where you actually I don't know work.

16
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:00,230
Scott: I work.

17
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:06,790
Scott: I just do all the work so fast faster than they give it to me Because I'm so good at it.

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:16,064
Scott: And the only reason I haven't done all my work is because depending on the work They give me I either it's a it's a good work Which means I do it so fast like in a second like BAM.

19
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:28,390
Scott: that was awesome, and it's fun And I think it's really satisfying, but it takes like a minute only because I'm awesome Not because it was actually take a minute or this other work That would take a minute if I wanted to do it, and I felt like doing it.

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,084
Scott: But it doesn't because I'm a lazy slow ass and it's not pleasant.

21
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:40,321
Rym: so I take my sweet ass time And see I was in the opposite situation at the hospital where the work was all trivial But I had to rely on other people who didn't know what they were doing.

22
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:43,558
Rym: so as a result most of my time I just kind of twiddle my thumbs.

23
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:45,490
Rym: would twiddle my thumbs meant sit on YouTube.

24
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,679
Rym: Yeah, and now I have a job where I actually do work.

25
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,930
Rym: the problem is because I'm it's like the higher level like you know You call a tech support place.

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,860
Rym: There's like the level one guy level two guy like the levels going up The higher up you get like there's no more easy work.

27
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:01,610
Rym: any job that is given to you is not going to be simple.

28
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,629
Rym: Yeah, because if it could have been done easily or quickly someone else would have already done it.

29
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:14,390
Scott: Yeah, but I spent most of the day at work today like you know programming something for myself, but then I finished it.

30
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,457
Scott: I was like shit what I do now.

31
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:17,943
Rym: I got some things you could program.

32
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:18,606
Scott: What do you want?

33
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:24,597
Rym: I want a multiband dynamic range compander Written in lisp.

34
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:25,522
Scott: that's not gonna happen.

35
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:26,406
Rym: That's what I need.

36
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:30,583
Rym: well tough Yeah, I started to learn lisp, but I need some time.

37
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:35,986
Scott: I guess to actually write these things I think it's really just whether doing something for myself or for someone else.

38
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:43,602
Scott: like if I want to do it BAM it's done, but if I don't want to do it Huh people like to do things they like to do and therefore they tend to do them.

39
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:44,866
Scott: Oh gasps.

40
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:47,159
Rym: Oh well We're tired.

41
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,268
Rym: We'll see where the show goes.

42
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:54,050
Scott: so Yeah, I don't have a lot of confidence for the show cuz mean it's also an incredibly slow news week and thing of the day.

43
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,619
Rym: Hey, there was a new angry video game nerd.

44
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:57,783
Scott: It was okay.

45
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:58,546
Rym: It was pretty good.

46
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,630
Scott: This is average work.

47
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:04,984
Rym: Anyway, there's web comics coming out tomorrow and yesterday, but not today.

48
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:06,068
Scott: web comics.

49
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:08,135
Rym: Yeah Read a webcomic.

50
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:09,982
Scott: There's a new Perry Powell Fellowship this morning.

51
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:10,545
Rym: Oh snap.

52
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,247
Rym: I haven't read that.

53
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,296
Rym: Yeah Tell me what you got.

54
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:13,960
Rym: I'm gonna read my.

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:21,840
Scott: yeah, actually cuz there's no news I'm gonna do a geek back and it's a geek back about Video games, but wait a way to cross days.

56
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,270
Scott: Yeah, it usually do it on Tuesday, but I guess I forgot to do it.

57
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:31,790
Scott: I mean this email came in on January 8th And I guess if I don't do it now, I'm gonna forget to do it and I got nothing else to do.

58
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,761
Scott: So why the fuck not shrink ray?

59
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,089
Scott: Yeah, that's a good one.

60
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,746
Rym: Hahaha That is a good one.

61
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,436
Scott: Anyway, anyway, all right.

62
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:41,978
Scott: So let me read.

63
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:43,663
Scott: I'm gonna read this email and it's entirely.

64
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:48,559
Scott: it's from vicious Smith Which I assume is vicious, but it's vic hu s.

65
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,044
Rym: maybe he's a vic uis.

66
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:52,070
Scott: I've seen him around on some forums.

67
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:54,701
Scott: I think this is a longtime listener kind of guy doesn't?

68
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,810
Rym: isn't he one of those Dave and Joel people do or something?

69
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,220
Scott: He might be he might be.

70
00:03:58,341 --> 00:04:06,475
Scott: anyway, let me read His emails short so I'm gonna read it in its entirety until I get to the the Just gonna read the whole thing.

71
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:06,716
Scott: Okay.

72
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,310
Scott: I'm a user of game fly and I've been angered with it lately.

73
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:15,550
Scott: My original intention was to play a bunch of crap games for a few days then send them back to play more crap games.

74
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:16,935
Scott: The problem is now.

75
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:20,649
Scott: I want to play better games and preview them before I decide to purchase them now.

76
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,555
Scott: Here are the problems.

77
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:28,230
Scott: The queue is filled with a Allegedly good games that are so popular I'll have to wait months for them to be available.

78
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,850
Scott: If I hold on to a game for more than a month or two I could have just bought it through eBay or some discount site.

79
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:38,904
Scott: I enjoy RPGs and RPGs are more involved than an action or RPG.

80
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,330
Scott: Okay Action RPG I guess.

81
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:43,916
Scott: So you have.

82
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:46,530
Rym: I haven't enjoyed an action RPG in a while.

83
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:52,636
Scott: So so have you guys used game fly and you think it's a waste of money to rent games 15 a month if you can Just wait for a good deal on games.

84
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:56,129
Rym: Well, it sounds like well, I guess you can answer this since this is your bit.

85
00:04:56,551 --> 00:05:06,910
Scott: I mean ideally right if the game fly was as good as Netflix was right and you're in a situation Where you have more time to play video games than you have video games to play.

86
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,826
Scott: Gamefly seems like a good idea because you can buy the games that you know You're gonna play again and again and again forever.

87
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:21,550
Scott: I never want to get rid of and all those other games that are like Popular when they come out for a month or two and then they go away forever and no one ever thinks of them again.

88
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:25,766
Scott: You can just rent those from the game fly and then send them back when you're done with them.

89
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:26,930
Scott: or a lot of those games.

90
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,734
Scott: Do you play them once?

91
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:28,799
Scott: you never gonna play them again.

92
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,010
Scott: get them from the game fly send them back, right?

93
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:37,430
Scott: But I I was not aware, you know I knew game about game fly and all I knew was that it was the Netflix of video games.

94
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,800
Rym: It's all that used to be before that way back.

95
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,426
Rym: There was red octane.

96
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:42,551
Scott: red octane I don't know.

97
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:44,137
Scott: They still offer offer that service.

98
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,105
Scott: think so because right now they're they're making.

99
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:50,407
Rym: you know, guitar hero guitars Yeah, but back then I remember when I first got a ps1.

100
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:54,059
Rym: I paid $80 for it at Kmart and I then immediately.

101
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,076
Rym: then I spent like 20 bucks on a six-pin mod chip and I don't think other Than one game to test.

102
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:05,641
Rym: I never put a non Dance Dance Revolution game in there But you can't get real DDR in the u.s.

103
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:06,664
Rym: Least back then you couldn't.

104
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:15,939
Rym: there was USA makes which was possibly one of the worst contrivances ever brought up unto the world by man and I thought wait a minute.

105
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:17,310
Rym: All right, how am I gonna get these games?

106
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:26,482
Rym: I tried to pirate them and I found that every ps1 pirated game was actually just either something horrible or some sort of virus Exe like ISO exe.

107
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:27,105
Rym: Oh, wow.

108
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:27,829
Rym: I wonder what that is.

109
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:35,119
Rym: yep, but then I saw the red octane had import games and Regular games and you could rent them much like Netflix.

110
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,190
Rym: So I said, alright, I signed up for a one-month free trial.

111
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:42,090
Rym: I filled my queue with every DDR game that had ever been released in Japan.

112
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:45,466
Rym: When they came I immediately copied them and then sent them back.

113
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,537
Rym: two weeks later I canceled the account.

114
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,450
Rym: and I know at every game of DDR ever.

115
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:59,470
Scott: Yeah when I was in high school I had a friend who would go to Blockbuster copy the ps1 games of the CD burner then bring it back to Blockbuster essentially Effectively buying video games for $3 because he also had the mod chip.

116
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,310
Scott: But I don't think you can copy the ps3 in the Xbox games and the Wii game so easily.

117
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,042
Rym: No, you can't copy ps1 games so easily.

118
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:08,890
Rym: a lot a lot of CDs just wouldn't work.

119
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,873
Rym: And yeah, if you're one of those fools who bought a four-pin mod ship or one of those external mod chips half the time It didn't work.

120
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:22,926
Scott: Anyway, yeah, so I was unaware that there was actually a problem with This game fly service where if a game is popular, you can't get it right away.

121
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:23,930
Scott: That is bullshit.

122
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:30,340
Scott: I mean, I mean imagine if on Netflix if you put a movie in your queue 99.9% of the time that movies coming next.

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,950
Scott: there's never a situation where the movie is so popular.

124
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,020
Scott: You have to wait does any?

125
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:35,110
Scott: we never had that problem.

126
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:37,638
Rym: When was the last time we watched a Netflix?

127
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,785
Scott: I know but I mean even when we were super Netflix.

128
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:50,026
Rym: now even when before we Podcasted when we were both out of college had plenty of money nothing to do with ourselves We watched every Netflix the day it came and sent it back.

129
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:57,680
Scott: sometimes that day Yeah, and we never had a problem, you know waiting in a queue for something wait, and he says so Wait a minute.

130
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:01,414
Rym: if we quit doing GeekNights We can do stuff.

131
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:02,737
Rym: Yeah, we can.

132
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:04,823
Rym: we can play video games and watch movies.

133
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,167
Rym: Yeah, then fuck this.

134
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:12,014
Scott: Okay, but Yeah, if they're not gonna send you the games you want right away That seems like a pretty.

135
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:15,850
Scott: you know, it's not a. the service isn't living up to its usefulness.

136
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,673
Scott: So what's the point?

137
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:18,660
Rym: I think there's a simpler answer to his question.

138
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,470
Rym: He basically said well, I wanted to use product day.

139
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:28,850
Rym: So I bought product day and I wanted to do B C and D But now I wanted to do E and it turns out it doesn't do E. should I stop paying for it?

140
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,753
Rym: And the answer is yes.

141
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:30,295
Rym: Yes.

142
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:31,098
Scott: It's pretty simple.

143
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:32,061
Rym: You answered your own question.

144
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:34,590
Rym: You said well, it doesn't do what I wanted to do.

145
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:35,854
Rym: Should I still pay?

146
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:38,082
Scott: Yeah, I guess on paper.

147
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:39,346
Scott: It's a good idea.

148
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:49,916
Scott: if yours communism Yeah, if you're the kind of person who needs to play a lot more video games than you are able to buy I think Scott Johnson has gamefly does he and you want to?

149
00:08:49,996 --> 00:09:00,569
Scott: you want to play more games than you can afford to buy and you don't have enough of them and You want to play a lot of games that you don't want to keep and you know You are you're willing to play crappier games then I guess it's a good idea.

150
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:07,870
Scott: Other than that, I guess it's you know, I guess the reality is it doesn't even do that and I'll admit I'll play.

151
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:11,090
Rym: Especially back when I had free time I would often play a subpar game.

152
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:13,189
Rym: Oh, yeah, you you get some enjoyment.

153
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:28,554
Rym: in fact if you have free time a lot of times a really bad game is almost fun in this cathartic kind of the quality of media you are willing to I guess consume goes down as Your free time increases.

154
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:33,910
Scott: the more free time you have the more willing you are to watch crappier things play crappier games and read.

155
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:40,750
Rym: Well, I think part of it's just that when you have more free time You're more willing to invest time on a risk that something may or may not be good.

156
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:44,104
Rym: Yep, I mean there are games that seem good and are good.

157
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:46,736
Rym: But after you play them for an hour They're not so fun anymore.

158
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:51,437
Rym: or games that would be good if you played them for four hours But they're not fun for an hour.

159
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,725
Rym: Yeah, and it's are you willing to give up that hour?

160
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,130
Rym: The answer is usually no nowadays.

161
00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:00,952
Scott: Yeah, you have to be more discerning when you have less free time and yet you can afford to be less discerning when you have More free time.

162
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,584
Rym: Well, anyway, speaking of free time and things that are worthwhile.

163
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:06,490
Rym: I have a geek bite.

164
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:07,273
Scott: No, no.

165
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,421
Scott: now, I guess there's no news today for real.

166
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,709
Rym: Well, there's news and I could talk about.

167
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:16,790
Rym: I'm Legally barred from talking about the one thing I do find interesting and want to talk about.

168
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,248
Scott: Well, you could have just told me to talk about it.

169
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,606
Rym: Yeah, but what do you have to say other than whoa, how do you do that?

170
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:25,340
Rym: Oh Cuz that was the conversation we had a little while ago.

171
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,504
Scott: Okay, that's what you wanted to talk.

172
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:26,806
Scott: Yeah.

173
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:27,328
Scott: Okay.

174
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:27,749
Rym: What do you do?

175
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:29,079
Rym: Oh, how do you do it?

176
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:39,390
Rym: Oh, wow hmm, but the Scott for a long time has been meaning to read a Series of books the first of which is called Hyperion by an author named Dan Simmons.

177
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:45,052
Rym: Dan Simmons is an awesome author and Scott never got around to this Independently.

178
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:46,197
Scott: we got around to a lot of things.

179
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:49,110
Rym: independently of Alex trying to convince Scott to read Hyperion.

180
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:50,757
Rym: I have been trying to convince.

181
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:51,942
Scott: he wasn't trying to convince me.

182
00:10:51,962 --> 00:10:53,830
Scott: I actually knew about the books from somewhere.

183
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:56,247
Scott: I asked him if he knew about them and he had them all.

184
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:04,552
Rym: Anyway, so I've been trying to tell Scott to read this other book called the terror and I remember when it dawned on Scott not Too long ago.

185
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:06,219
Scott: I get whenever anyone says terror.

186
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,303
Scott: I can't think.

187
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:10,116
Scott: I can't help but think about the stupid magic card Really?

188
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:15,132
Rym: I think about Cthulhu usually also There was.

189
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,640
Scott: was it an anime where it was like that terror?

190
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:19,225
Scott: Oh gassaraki.

191
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:19,927
Rym: Oh, yeah.

192
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:20,870
Rym: No, that's right.

193
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,513
Rym: We watched that show.

194
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,321
Scott: tell we watched it dubbed on VHS.

195
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:25,209
Scott: I own all the dubbed VHS's.

196
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:35,586
Rym: Wow this anyway, so it dawned upon Scott that the terror is written by the same person.

197
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,664
Rym: So very briefly the terror is a is a fictional book about the.

198
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:44,770
Rym: you know a novel if you will.

199
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:52,430
Rym: Well, well, I'll get to that because it is fiction But at the same time it edges very very very close to nonfiction.

200
00:11:53,432 --> 00:12:02,207
Rym: You see it's about an expedition that was taken in the late or middle middling 1800s To find the Northwest Passage in the Arctic.

201
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:05,844
Rym: now This is a time when ships were mostly made out of wood and steam.

202
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:07,290
Rym: power was laughable.

203
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:16,839
Rym: So a bunch of guys got into two ships the HMS Erebus and the HMS terror and they go on Into the Northwest Passage.

204
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,389
Scott: What a great way to name your boat that's gonna go into the North Pole.

205
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:22,356
Rym: now I'm reading this book and I didn't.

206
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:23,359
Rym: I just read it.

207
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,570
Rym: I didn't do any research any backstory and oh, this book's awesome.

208
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,770
Rym: It's about some monster and it's kind of eerie and good and historical fiction.

209
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:37,181
Rym: But I got about three-quarters of the way through and I'm feeling okay about this book even though it's really tragic and really sad and really it.

210
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:46,038
Rym: it goes into the Procedural details of dealing with scurvy when you're alone in the Arctic and dying of frostbite You mean losing eye teeth and such.

211
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,575
Rym: yeah vomiting and diarrhea and blood all that Scurvy sucks.

212
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:52,181
Scott: don't get scurvy.

213
00:12:52,241 --> 00:13:00,293
Rym: Even if you think you're it's gonna really help your pirate costume I think some guy at NYU got scurvy just because he didn't eat oranges For long enough.

214
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:01,096
Scott: How could you?

215
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:05,190
Scott: almost everything has vitamin C even bread some bread, you know.

216
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,110
Rym: I'm surprised that guy Greg's old roommate who did nothing but play Asheron's call never got scurvy.

217
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,929
Scott: Well, because he'd always go to Gracie's get a meal a decent meal and bring it back.

218
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:22,695
Scott: I mean as you know Gracie's wasn't the greatest food But it wasn't bad as bad as you know, you like to make fun of it for being and you know It's got to make it all the way to Gracie's.

219
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:23,577
Scott: it was nutritional.

220
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:26,425
Rym: So well barely I guess.

221
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:39,489
Rym: there there is the the the commonly known thing at RIT that freshman will have a more voluminous output of Feces than they did in their previous life do almost entirely to the composition of the food and Gracie's.

222
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,830
Rym: it's true.

223
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:47,727
Rym: But I got most of the way through this book and I'm digging it even though a lot of people are dying horribly and it's a really bleak depressing scary book.

224
00:13:47,768 --> 00:14:00,460
Rym: and then randomly, I look on Wikipedia and I discover that this book is actually very close to what actually happened to these people and it's based on historical documents According to Wikipedia.

225
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,507
Rym: Well, no it actually is.

226
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:09,150
Rym: this book is Extremely well researched bit of historical fiction and is probably the thing is so the fiction is just the monster.

227
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:10,568
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

228
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:18,150
Rym: Everything that happens to these people is very realistic and is very probably very close to what actually happened to this expedition.

229
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:23,590
Rym: but There's a monster in the novel and you think alright the monster is obviously not real.

230
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,110
Rym: Well, once you realize what actually happened to these people the monster kind of makes sense.

231
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:31,315
Rym: Uh-huh in a realistic.

232
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:38,333
Scott: so they went insane and they all believed it was a monster possibly something like sort of a group You know Delusion.

233
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:46,577
Rym: well possibly due to the fact that there's a good chance that everyone on this expedition was suffering by lead poisoning Due to poorly canned food.

234
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,623
Scott: Oh in pride in lead cans.

235
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,590
Rym: Yeah lead solder around the seal.

236
00:14:50,912 --> 00:15:07,147
Rym: Oh, so awesome, but I don't want to get in a lot of details about this book but if you like a very gritty very realistic very procedural story about the shall we say Difficulties of exploring the Arctic in a wooden ship with lead monsters in the 1800s.

237
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:21,690
Rym: And one thing you'll learn and this is this is definitely true British people exploring back then in the Arctic Didn't know shit about exploring in the Arctic and most of the problems they had were due to their own stupidity as you will learn.

238
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:27,529
Rym: Well, of course, they didn't know know what it done it before No, but they didn't even think that you'll see when you read the book.

239
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:33,819
Rym: They brought a lot of things with them that did not need to be brought with them and failed to bring things They did need to be brought.

240
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:45,478
Rym: possibly also I'd like to note that if you're going to out monster extinguisher if you're going to outfit shark into the Arctic and You're finding someone to make your food bring Batman.

241
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,749
Scott: I'd recommend Batman because that way he'll have always had the right tool at the right time.

242
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:54,568
Rym: They would add some canned food and then a boat shark repellent.

243
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:56,686
Rym: You know, there's no sharks up.

244
00:15:56,707 --> 00:16:00,282
Scott: there Should be but polar bear repellent.

245
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:01,929
Rym: don't go with the lowest bidder.

246
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:20,659
Rym: Yeah, yeah, especially for the boat, but the the terror by Dan Simmons is a fantastic novel though It is not for the squeamish of stomach or light of heart things of the day.

247
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:23,735
Rym: It's really rare that I read a new webcomic.

248
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,358
Rym: I mean, I think dr.

249
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,236
Rym: McNinja and Wondermark are the most recent comics.

250
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:29,779
Rym: I've added to my the latest Wondermark.

251
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,313
Rym: It's good stuff, I don't know if that can beat stove cat.

252
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,728
Scott: no, it's not as good as dove cat But it's still.

253
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,519
Scott: it's pretty good.

254
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,830
Scott: I mean He's definitely doing a much more funniness lately.

255
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:44,366
Rym: and the thing is about that comic is a lot of the jokes He does or they've been done before.

256
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:44,928
Rym: it's not like.

257
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,780
Rym: oh, I haven't seen a joke like this before but sometimes his jokes original.

258
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,605
Rym: It's just the way there.

259
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,813
Rym: I don't know the style and the way it's done just always gets me.

260
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:56,220
Scott: It's fantastic poop jokes and top hat.

261
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:59,865
Rym: But I don't.

262
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,899
Rym: I didn't even look at what the rest of this comic is.

263
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:04,930
Rym: All I know is that I saw a link to it.

264
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,619
Rym: I guess the comic is called truck bearing kibble.

265
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:09,931
Rym: But all right it the.

266
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:19,405
Rym: the title of this comic is on executable and it's a Lego man and a Lego Pope and a Lego executioner and Lego gallows.

267
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:25,794
Rym: it is the only thing that could have made it better I guess if it had been the same Lego gallows that I always made as a kid.

268
00:17:25,814 --> 00:17:28,624
Rym: you take that whip and you stick it On top of a Lego.

269
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:33,438
Scott: I made the gallows the same way with my Robin Hood's forest men playset.

270
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,480
Rym: I remember I got in trouble as a kid cuz my brother had his like Lego world.

271
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:38,676
Rym: I had mine and we'd fight.

272
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:40,949
Scott: See I always had all the forest men and I had these.

273
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,420
Scott: at first I got this one that was like these two trees.

274
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:48,165
Scott: Right, but one tree had a door and a platform, you know and the other one had a ladder.

275
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:53,146
Scott: and then there was a bridge that went from one tree to the other and all the Robin Hood guys would stay.

276
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:55,960
Scott: all the Robin Hood Lego guys would stand on it and shoot arrows, right?

277
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,065
Scott: Well, they wouldn't really shoot the arrows.

278
00:17:57,085 --> 00:18:00,180
Rym: They'd hold it bow and arrow in one hand and smile, right?

279
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,091
Scott: Then I got this other.

280
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,440
Scott: they also had quivers on their backs.

281
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:04,607
Scott: Um, then I got it.

282
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,820
Scott: then I got his other Robin Hood Lego.

283
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:19,244
Scott: He playset where it was like this big tree like the whole thing opened up and it was at a door that would open and close like a like a port cutlass without spikes and it had a little Drawbridge.

284
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:22,840
Scott: and it was like a tree in the middle of the water and it was high quality.

285
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:26,720
Scott: So then I got a castle and I was big in those castles.

286
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,505
Rym: Yeah I remember when I got ice planet.

287
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,675
Rym: that was like the biggest hot shit to ever raise my press.

288
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:33,040
Scott: ice planet was wicked cool.

289
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,548
Scott: but all I ever had from ice planet was one guy in a snowmobile and it Orange ain't neon orange chainsaw.

290
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:40,231
Rym: See that's the thing.

291
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:50,819
Scott: The neon orange was like the most valuable so high and neon orange stuff was wicked cool with the blue and the chainsaws and Lego dudes the chainsaws to cut the ice.

292
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:56,980
Rym: Yeah, made out of the rarest substance in the world as far as those guys can tell a translucent neon orange Lego.

293
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:03,895
Rym: But I remember I got in trouble as a kid because you know My brother and I had our different Lego worlds and we were always war.

294
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:04,880
Scott: We're not doing a show about Lego.

295
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:07,296
Scott: No, you're gonna tell the story about the stupid space shuttle.

296
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,820
Rym: No, no, no I'm not gonna tell the whole story.

297
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,640
Rym: But I got in trouble when I I caught some of his spies that he'd stuck into my land.

298
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:19,451
Rym: so to make an example to the others I Had a public hanging and I left them all.

299
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:20,154
Scott: you brought it.

300
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:23,590
Scott: you brought it back Back around to the yellows, but I did.

301
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:31,640
Rym: I hung four of his Lego men as spies And I brought them on a little cart with a gallows in front of his base and left it in his room with a warning.

302
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:33,557
Rym: And then my mom yelled at me.

303
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,130
Scott: But I've been clever.

304
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,517
Rym: this joke is good on multiple levels and I'll leave it at that.

305
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:49,293
Rym: I think what helps one Everyone's smiling because they're like, oh man, yeah, of course and two it's just.

306
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:50,777
Rym: it's so perfect.

307
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,465
Rym: It's pretty good Alright, so what do you got for me?

308
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:57,040
Scott: Oh, it's pretty lame for things the day if Rym has to go to a webcomic.

309
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:57,992
Scott: So I'm even lamer here.

310
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:17,414
Scott: formula one starts again in like 40 some odd days right before formula one begins again the next season and You know it's now's about the time and people start to show off all the new cars and the new Ferrari is like God, I don't think I've ever seen a better car in my life.

311
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:18,640
Scott: You got to look at this thing.

312
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,432
Scott: It's just the odd blows you away And they even show the steering wheel is more complex than ever.

313
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:25,340
Scott: I don't know how the fuck the people drive these fucking things.

314
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:25,711
Scott: I don't know.

315
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:29,408
Scott: But yeah There's a the f1 webs the official formula.

316
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:33,740
Scott: one website is actually redone and it's now no longer sucks ass.

317
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:41,460
Scott: So they actually have this really convenient Well-designed gallery where you can easily look at all the pictures the new cars.

318
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:43,887
Scott: So I'll just link you to that and you can go.

319
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:50,288
Scott: ooh and ah pictures of new cars that are awesome Speaking of which as soon as it gets warm up.

320
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,155
Rym: We got to do that go-kart thing.

321
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:53,580
Rym: We keep talking about never do it.

322
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,904
Rym: Yes, we have the money.

323
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:55,767
Rym: We can do it.

324
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:59,740
Scott: the key words when it's warm because woman it's gold.

325
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,667
Rym: But speaking of just going and doing things.

326
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:11,802
Rym: I don't know if you've been able to guess from the title of the episode, but We at the front row crew have a long-standing tradition of every year Like.

327
00:21:12,224 --> 00:21:15,620
Rym: I guess part of it's that we we did things in college when we were poor.

328
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,386
Rym: So things we did had to be like.

329
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:23,732
Rym: we had to never take risks or we just lose out because we couldn't afford to make A mistake like driving to Otakon.

330
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:27,219
Rym: if we'd so much as gotten lost We might not have had enough money to buy gas to get home.

331
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,251
Scott: Well, maybe you I had a little buffer, but I was.

332
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:30,652
Scott: I was.

333
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,459
Scott: I was bad but not as bad as you were.

334
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:32,720
Scott: you were.

335
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:34,543
Scott: You had to.

336
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:36,148
Scott: you know have people feed you.

337
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:41,335
Scott: I didn't but I still would go there with a pile of money and then leave Empty-handed and then you know, yeah

338
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:55,431
Rym: Yeah but Like after Kyle we kind of got set in our ways for every year like the big trip of the front row crew would be We'd all go to Otakon every year and then we'd have a road rally to Wildwood, New Jersey Where we'd stay at Scott Johnson's Beach House for the week.

339
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,260
Scott: Yeah, and Wildwood is great, you know.

340
00:21:57,501 --> 00:22:10,220
Scott: but the thing about Wildwood is that the reason we did that is because It was sort of like you went with Otakon So you sort of were more efficient use of your vacation time Yeah, and also it was partly that that was kind of for a long time.

341
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,940
Rym: That was the era where the front row crew was scattered to the wind.

342
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:15,240
Rym: Everyone got out of college and all went out and got jobs.

343
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,450
Rym: It was before we'd all kind of come back together in upstate.

344
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:24,894
Scott: Well upstate or downstate, New York, depending on your perspective Yeah, but it was also really cheap because we someone had a house there.

345
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:26,120
Scott: We'd had to pay for a hotel.

346
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:34,959
Scott: Transportation was by car, you know, we could carpool Yeah, and also being on vacation for a week like that was public and free.

347
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:39,080
Rym: It definitely added the aspect of you don't have to do shit.

348
00:22:39,502 --> 00:22:42,560
Rym: We get there and we'd spend two days just laying in the house doing nothing.

349
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:46,240
Scott: I mean you go on a vacation somewhere like Disney World or something, you know, which can be fun.

350
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,145
Scott: I've done that twice.

351
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:50,020
Scott: you got to like get up and run around and do things.

352
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Scott: You know if you go to the public beach and your friend owns the beach house, you could just be like I wake up whenever you want.

353
00:22:58,604 --> 00:23:00,380
Scott: Take your sweet ass time.

354
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,576
Scott: Nothing cut nothing really cost you money, but food and arcade games.

355
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,830
Rym: Yes when you're hungry There's infinite amounts of fried things.

356
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:10,380
Scott: when you're more hungry need real food.

357
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,260
Scott: You got to get in the car for five minutes, but that's okay because then you go to that diner.

358
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,131
Rym: I love that diner.

359
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:15,759
Scott: It's a good dinner.

360
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,295
Rym: It's not the best honor in the world, but it's in the upper some percent.

361
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:20,480
Scott: I like the Russo's.

362
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:24,730
Rym: Other is almost as good as the de Bellas the Russo's we're.

363
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,362
Rym: a small sandwich is too much and a large sandwich is fucking too much Exactly.

364
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:31,591
Rym: I remember the first time I went there.

365
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,960
Rym: I was like, oh man that large is eight bucks.

366
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,570
Rym: I'm getting in Scott Johnson's like you should reconsider like those where the sides are better than the meal.

367
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:45,079
Rym: Yeah, chocolate pudding and that cheese broccoli thing she's broccoli.

368
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:50,478
Rym: Oh That guy's out of business anyway.

369
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,000
Rym: So part of the appeal to was that you know, the crew is somewhat scattered.

370
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,920
Rym: We didn't get to see each other for like we'd all get together for things.

371
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,540
Rym: But the week of awesome as it was called the first time we did it was kind of this chance.

372
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:05,386
Rym: It was like our Mecca our homecoming.

373
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:17,806
Rym: the whole front row crew would go to Otakon and have a crazy time But we wouldn't really hang out because Otakon you got to do stuff And then we go to the beach and we just hang out for a week and it was kind of like the annual reset of The crew but

374
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,919
Scott: also New Year's and that was it though.

375
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:25,620
Rym: Yeah But now we all live together and we all were all relatively successful in our in our relative domains.

376
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:32,020
Rym: And now it's to the point where I feel like we're young and I want to sew wild oats as it were.

377
00:24:32,702 --> 00:24:38,420
Scott: Yeah, I mean my plan was always, you know, I like at first like it was sort of unthinkable that we would not go to.

378
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:44,985
Scott: So it was like a natural thing like of course I go to Wildwood and I was trying to make plans to do another Vacation in addition to that.

379
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:50,127
Scott: like I want to go on a real vacation, you know Europe or something to see old shit That's always scotch dick.

380
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:51,637
Rym: I want to go where the old shit is.

381
00:24:51,677 --> 00:24:52,100
Scott: look at it.

382
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,264
Scott: That's pretty much what I want to do.

383
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:59,868
Scott: is I want to go where their castles and ruins and you know South America like Aztecs and Incas.

384
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:03,059
Rym: that is the main reason why I want to go to Turkey so much.

385
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:08,080
Scott: Well, because you want to see that specific old shit because that podcast got you interested in that.

386
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,531
Rym: Specifically, I just want to go to the the Mediterranean in general.

387
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:18,866
Scott: Yeah, I've been to Israel which is technically Mediterranean and part of it, you know and Mediterranean is awesome by me.

388
00:25:18,947 --> 00:25:20,876
Scott: See some grease see some Italy.

389
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:21,499
Scott: I could do that.

390
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:24,429
Rym: Well, we were thinking about this and then we kind of suddenly realized.

391
00:25:24,449 --> 00:25:24,931
Rym: Wait a minute.

392
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:29,638
Rym: We're young and we have no Responsibilities and we have money.

393
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:30,543
Rym: There's.

394
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:35,160
Rym: there is no reason not to go out and do the things we want to do now while we're still young enough to enjoy.

395
00:25:35,622 --> 00:25:47,782
Scott: Also part of the problem is I don't have enough vacation days right - that's you yeah, but I don't have enough vacation days to do all the conventions and things and then also go to Wildwood and then also do Something else.

396
00:25:47,823 --> 00:25:50,133
Scott: So the idea came and I said, you know what?

397
00:25:50,153 --> 00:25:51,539
Scott: I've been to Wildwood enough times.

398
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:53,267
Scott: I'm not gonna go there for us in my life.

399
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:54,493
Scott: Let's do something besides.

400
00:25:54,533 --> 00:26:03,325
Rym: that instead of that and Coincident to that was the idea that why don't we do one of those things that people always say they do but they won't one Of those things that we've always said?

401
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:03,787
Rym: we'll do that.

402
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:04,249
Rym: We won't.

403
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,920
Rym: let's go on our road trip.

404
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:09,891
Scott: Well, not exactly not exactly the full-on road trip.

405
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:15,875
Rym: Well, the thing is the original plan was yeah Why don't we just get a Winnebago and drive from here to California?

406
00:26:15,896 --> 00:26:20,050
Rym: And we're like, yeah Yeah, and we're planning our vacation days for that.

407
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,572
Scott: It's a boat.

408
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:28,245
Rym: We're like, alright, let's see if we start You know here and we go up through New York and we could stop it like Cedar Point along the way Stop in Chicago,

409
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:28,325
Scott: and

410
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:32,220
Rym: then I realized that once we get to like Minneapolis

411
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:36,455
Scott: Once you pass like Mount Rushmore, there's nothing.

412
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:41,270
Rym: once you've had Milwaukee There's nothing until you hit Mount Rushmore and then there's nothing again.

413
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,012
Rym: Nothing.

414
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:42,574
Rym: Nothing.

415
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,055
Rym: Nothing to you.

416
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:44,820
Rym: It's Spokane, but there's nothing in Spokane.

417
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,234
Scott: Yeah, unless you go you got to go way south or to like Vegas to get something.

418
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:51,080
Scott: It's just the middle of nowhere.

419
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:51,482
Scott: So we

420
00:26:51,522 --> 00:27:04,991
Rym: realized that all right, that's infeasible and also probably wouldn't be that fun Unlike because then it would basically be the week of awesome, but we'd all be sitting in a Winnebago Living out of it and instead of living at a beach house

421
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:08,143
Scott: and at all that and during the that time someone would have to Be driving.

422
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:11,640
Rym: Well, I think the gas yeah, that was the other thing that got me.

423
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,908
Rym: It's like all right, Winnebagos get what six miles to a gallon.

424
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:16,055
Rym: We're gonna drive what 2,000 miles.

425
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:17,380
Rym: how much does gas cost?

426
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:25,169
Scott: Yeah, the thing is, you know, if you spend the same amount of time in a hotel a nice hotel It's gonna you know be the same amount of money.

427
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:31,094
Scott: ish, you know, so the gas while it's expensive You got to realize that gas is instead of your hotel cost.

428
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:32,360
Scott: so it kind of works out.

429
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:38,524
Rym: Yeah But at the same time part of the reason you want to go on a road trip is not to sit in a car The whole time.

430
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:44,420
Rym: yeah with your friends you can you can sit in your house playing a DS game exactly and all and well.

431
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:53,814
Rym: Oh see the country, but I I don't want to dis South Dakota and Wyoming and Montana and Idaho But I have better things to do with my time.

432
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,040
Rym: I've driven through Ohio.

433
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:55,964
Rym: I know what that's like.

434
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:57,491
Scott: the people in those states are probably like.

435
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:58,596
Scott: we understand we live here.

436
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:02,129
Rym: Yeah But so then we thought wait a minute.

437
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,078
Rym: All right going to PAX.

438
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:08,391
Scott: Yeah We're going to PAX no matter what we will be there at PAX.

439
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:12,464
Scott: Oh wait, there's a guarantee unless we die or something We might not be guests.

440
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,834
Rym: We might not be doing events, but we're gonna be going.

441
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:23,300
Scott: we're gonna be going if even if we have To go as normal people and if we go as normal people We'll sit around playing games go into the concert and go into the big events.

442
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:25,760
Rym: Wow, it'll be so weird to beat a con as a civilian.

443
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:31,039
Scott: You know this year when he starts being like Omega not something something I can actually go for it.

444
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:37,400
Rym: You know what as my the odds of even having a chance to compete are so low that then why not go for it?

445
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:38,265
Rym: No, I'll go for it.

446
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,599
Scott: Anyway, and if I make it then I'll start training.

447
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,766
Rym: I would train so hardcore.

448
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,075
Scott: But anyway, I would go buy a 360 and train it up.

449
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:46,219
Rym: I'd take a week off work.

450
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:48,167
Scott: Maybe I wouldn't have a week.

451
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,031
Scott: I'm using the week to go.

452
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:49,996
Rym: I got another week.

453
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:52,746
Rym: I take the week off I would do nothing but train for a week straight.

454
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:57,100
Rym: But anyway, yeah, so alright, but people always say well go out west.

455
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,366
Rym: You know road trip out west.

456
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:06,400
Rym: and we thought well if you look at Google Maps all the stuff We want to see out west isn't a nice swoosh pretty much from Dallas down and all the way up to Seattle.

457
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:09,498
Rym: so Why not just fly out there?

458
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:16,100
Rym: Do all the drive all around the southwest and then drive into California and catch a train to Seattle.

459
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,780
Scott: Yep, I mean some plan along those lines.

460
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,893
Scott: I mean that the problem here is exactly how many days we have.

461
00:29:21,954 --> 00:29:23,541
Scott: cuz I mean look at all the things we want to Do.

462
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:27,340
Scott: we want to go to Texas to see Texas and they got the Schlitter bond there?

463
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,228
Scott: Which is the best water park in the world supposedly?

464
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:34,588
Rym: Yeah, but then we got a desert bus it from Houston all the way to El Paso.

465
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:35,854
Scott: Yeah, that's that kind of.

466
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,120
Scott: that's pretty sucky, right?

467
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,579
Rym: And I really want to go to El Paso.

468
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,617
Rym: Yeah, my grandpa has been there a bunch of times and we could swing through San Antonio go to the basement.

469
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:47,980
Scott: Yep We go like Mexico this cool stuff that we're going to Mexico.

470
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:49,980
Rym: Anyway, speaking of which get your passport in order.

471
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:58,296
Rym: All of you all of you out there in the front row crew who may be listening to this and planning to come now My passports been in order since like 2000. my passport not so much in order.

472
00:29:58,457 --> 00:29:58,939
Scott: a good job.

473
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:01,747
Rym: Yeah, I mean we got to decide.

474
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:05,220
Rym: I mean we're gonna fly into El Paso Tucson Phoenix right into Vegas.

475
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:16,637
Scott: We got to fly somewhere west probably southwest and then make our way north and we had to get to Seattle on like Thursday Perplex and then fly home from Seattle to New York.

476
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:25,300
Rym: Yep So this is turning into something awesome And I I'm kind of excited about it because yeah, this is kind of like the the baby run the test run.

477
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,409
Rym: We're gonna we're gonna do this crazy trip.

478
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,220
Rym: And while we're gonna plan we're not gonna plan so thoroughly.

479
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:32,600
Rym: We're kind of just gonna wing it after a certain point.

480
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:38,403
Scott: The thing is we do have to sort of have a schedule or else because if we don't make it to Seattle by Thursday or Friday Then it.

481
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:39,959
Scott: we just botched the whole plan.

482
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,868
Rym: Well, no, cuz the thing is worst case scenario.

483
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:47,460
Rym: say we get to San Francisco and we've we've screwed up and we don't have time.

484
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:49,687
Rym: Just get on a plane to see ya.

485
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:53,520
Scott: No, I'm talking like, you know, we're in Vegas on Thursday or some, you know.

486
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,580
Rym: Or we catch him a red-eye flight from Vegas to Seattle.

487
00:30:56,824 --> 00:30:57,800
Rym: We pay out the buck for it.

488
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,960
Scott: But then we get there, you know saying we could be caught maybe like in between like Vegas and San Francisco.

489
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,053
Scott: Or you know, we could have bad timing or something.

490
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,180
Rym: the odds of that are pretty low.

491
00:31:06,301 --> 00:31:07,734
Scott: Yeah, we could you know.

492
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:08,319
Scott: just you know.

493
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:19,200
Scott: The other thing is depending on how far away from San Francisco or Seattle we start The less time we have to spend in each thing and the more sort of interim traveling we have to do.

494
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,340
Rym: Yeah Like as much as I want to see Texas and also It works that we could fly out there meet two of our friends and then continue.

495
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:30,500
Rym: It's like every step closer we start we can relax more do more in that area.

496
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,680
Scott: Yeah It's like if we fly just to Vegas and don't go anywhere from Vegas except Seattle.

497
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:39,320
Scott: Then we can spend a whole shit a ton of time there, but you don't need to spend that much time there.

498
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:49,053
Scott: But as we fly to say Arizona, then we can spend you know half time in Arizona half time in Vegas But then we lose the hours it takes to get from Arizona to Vegas.

499
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:53,452
Scott: you see so every additional thing We want to see because everything is spread out.

500
00:31:53,492 --> 00:31:55,140
Scott: I point out we lose a bunch of travel time.

501
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,010
Rym: There's effectively no speed limit in Arizona.

502
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:58,900
Rym: I know I know we can get there pretty quick.

503
00:31:58,961 --> 00:31:59,858
Scott: It's still a few hours.

504
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,660
Scott: You know We're losing time each additional stop, and I'm not saying we should have the minimum number possible stops.

505
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:06,566
Scott: I'm saying we need to.

506
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:15,949
Rym: you know it's tough to calculate this business yep But the real deal is that the only time I've ever been out west was not that long ago when for the first time first Time I was ever west of Chicago.

507
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:18,000
Scott: I've never been west of Novi, Michigan.

508
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:24,855
Rym: Wow, I took Scott the furthest west he's ever been yeah, and I've been south to Florida though.

509
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:26,500
Rym: Yeah, I've also been south.

510
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:37,679
Rym: I've been all up and down the east side of the country Westside never and I've been to Israel Which is either really far east or really far west and I guess if you count the plane like flew over Italy and shit.

511
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:41,859
Rym: so But yeah, you know this is one of those things that a lot of people always talk about.

512
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:50,140
Rym: yeah I want to go on a road trip out west drive through the desert and A lot of people should talk when it comes to that sort of thing, but we for once are not shit talking.

513
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,985
Rym: We're gonna do this.

514
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:54,994
Rym: It's just a matter of how and exactly what the Itinerary is gonna be.

515
00:32:55,095 --> 00:32:56,830
Rym: yeah I mean I'm thinking it in general.

516
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,887
Rym: the stuff we want to do is first My mom's ranch in Tucson.

517
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:04,125
Rym: we can stop there because there's a lot of stuff in Tucson to do in the desert Lot of stuff.

518
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,033
Scott: I've been to deserts, but deserts are okay.

519
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,580
Scott: I'd like to see some Grand Canyon action.

520
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:15,419
Rym: Yeah, well the thing is if we fly into Arizona right around there There's a lot to do and a lot to see ghost towns everywhere and those towns are cool of course.

521
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,292
Rym: up We want to go to Mexico pretty much the closest place to Mexico.

522
00:33:19,593 --> 00:33:26,940
Rym: There is Nogales, which is See the word I would say seedy, but I don't think that really does Nogales justice.

523
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,391
Scott: I don't really want to go to a seedy Mexican place.

524
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:31,400
Scott: I want to sort of go to a happy Mexican place.

525
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:36,124
Rym: Yeah, I want to go somewhere like El Paso, but then we got to start in Texas Or Roswell or something.

526
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,229
Rym: I guess we could start in El Paso.

527
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,634
Scott: I don't really want to go to Roswell.

528
00:33:38,674 --> 00:33:39,618
Scott: There's nutjabs.

529
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:42,869
Rym: nah Yeah But yeah, I mean from there.

530
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:48,632
Rym: We're thinking maybe we'll drive up through All that to Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon.

531
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:51,060
Rym: They're kind of near each other definitely want to go to those things.

532
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,884
Scott: Those are high-quality.

533
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:55,580
Rym: I want to spend a day or two in Vegas partly because I don't really want to gamble.

534
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:02,804
Rym: I mean I can gamble in Atlantic City, and I've learned that gambling is great because you win a lot of money Next time Rym gambles.

535
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:04,429
Scott: Oh, sorry guys.

536
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:05,794
Scott: I got to go back to New York.

537
00:34:05,854 --> 00:34:06,697
Scott: I lost all my money.

538
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:09,045
Rym: campaign bags See I I've.

539
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:11,637
Rym: I have won for you, but 100% of the time.

540
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:20,632
Rym: I've gambled once Other times when when I went to Canada what about me gambled at the RIT casino night.

541
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:22,340
Rym: you lost big, but that wasn't real money.

542
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:25,380
Scott: Hey, well you had to pay real money to get that fake money.

543
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,014
Rym: I think real money to get fake money, and then we bet it all on red.

544
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:36,040
Scott: Yeah If you would have won that we would have had a ps2 on Release which we probably would have been immediately sold and then bought food.

545
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:37,059
Scott: I don't think I would have sold it.

546
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,614
Rym: I think oh you realize that you would have owned like 1/6 of it.

547
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:44,139
Rym: We would have been in the Bart Simpson Radioactive Man number one scenario.

548
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,717
Rym: You're right, and I think the rest of us would have voted to sell it.

549
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:49,603
Rym: So that's what.

550
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:52,924
Rym: there was only one game out back then that dumb robot game That wasn't fun.

551
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,735
Scott: zone of the enders was a good game was okay.

552
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:55,580
Scott: It is very short.

553
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,563
Scott: There wasn't much to it.

554
00:34:56,705 --> 00:34:59,215
Scott: like I remember I would be like anime club social nights.

555
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:03,686
Scott: people do playing zone of the enders They just beat it right there, and I'd be like oh well That's not much of a game is it?

556
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:10,240
Rym: if it's so quick yeah, but in terms of Vegas I mean I feel like if you live in America you should go to Vegas at least once.

557
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,000
Rym: It's pretty much the pleasure capital of this country.

558
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:14,938
Scott: Yeah, I want to see some shows.

559
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,192
Scott: Gamble one time at least.

560
00:35:17,212 --> 00:35:18,120
Rym: I just want to see shows.

561
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,760
Rym: I pretty much plan to get to Vegas and I want to eat and get tickets to every show that I want to see.

562
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,283
Scott: Yeah, can we?

563
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:26,400
Scott: because they it's you know Vegas is the one place?

564
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,184
Scott: I mean in New York.

565
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:33,240
Scott: right if you want to go see a show like Broadway they have Sometimes this afternoon shows like on the weekends, and I think also Wednesdays, right?

566
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,347
Scott: I don't remember exactly.

567
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:35,696
Rym: plus you can just pay out the button.

568
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:36,219
Rym: you know go.

569
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:49,240
Scott: And the shows at night in Vegas the shows in the morning the late morning the after Early-afternoon late afternoon the night between the late night the crack of dawn in the morning the all-you-can-eat steak buffet.

570
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:51,674
Scott: Yeah, I mean, it's like this just shows constantly.

571
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:55,007
Scott: you could just spend all day Seeing a different show every single moment.

572
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:59,360
Scott: live shows you know cuz live entertainment is a whole different category than you know.

573
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:02,879
Rym: Non live entertainment, and if you don't gamble it doesn't cost that much.

574
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:10,340
Scott: No, it doesn't because most of those you know shows and things are sort of things to attract people to where there is gambling.

575
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:18,480
Scott: and The reason those shows and things are so cheap is because the gambling subsidizes them, so if you minimize your gambling You know I'd gamble maybe once maybe twice.

576
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:21,579
Rym: I'll just go into one casino put like 400 bucks on red and walk.

577
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:30,876
Scott: yeah I mean no I wouldn't do that I'd go to like a cheap casino or like this very low minimums and I would like play every game once because the way I view a casino is like an arcade.

578
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:37,239
Scott: you know like if I Go into a video arcade I put money in these machines and fun comes out And I don't care that I lost money.

579
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:44,666
Scott: So if I go into a casino, and I play like you know poker with some guys right and it cost me You know 20 bucks.

580
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:46,514
Rym: You're not gonna find a poker table.

581
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:47,800
Rym: That's gonna cost you 20 bucks.

582
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:51,226
Scott: I'm just saying if I get 20 bucks of fun Then it was worth it.

583
00:36:51,286 --> 00:36:57,938
Scott: if it cost me 500 bucks all right now I don't think I'm getting a $500 worth of fun playing poker But if I was it would be a good deal.

584
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:04,360
Rym: now How much fun would you have playing $20 worth of craps versus how much fun would you have playing $20 worth of Rampart arcade?

585
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:07,369
Rym: Yeah, that's the problem with that.

586
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:09,058
Scott: that is the problem with that, but you know I like.

587
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:10,607
Rym: I like the way We gambled in Atlantic City.

588
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:18,892
Rym: we walked in we bet all the money We brought on red or black or whatever a bunch of times And then as soon as we were ahead we walked right out of there.

589
00:37:18,912 --> 00:37:19,936
Scott: Yeah, that's what you gotta do.

590
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:23,536
Rym: all right That trip is still paying for everything.

591
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,203
Scott: I do No, it's not.

592
00:37:25,424 --> 00:37:27,991
Rym: I've contributed one cent of that gambling money to everything.

593
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:29,355
Rym: I've done since I'd gambled.

594
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:41,969
Rym: you've made a hundred transactions say Anyway So but also I really want to see Penn and tell her partly because you can just go talk to them after the show and I feel like I could talk to Penn for a little bit.

595
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:48,212
Scott: No if he doesn't just be like yeah, I'm crazy What I know blah yeah, yeah, but I could get his attention.

596
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,596
Scott: I think yeah, but it's like.

597
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:50,720
Scott: what would I say to him?

598
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,760
Scott: You can only you know he talked to him for like a minute or so.

599
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,684
Scott: Maybe you know.

600
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,989
Rym: so it's like yeah, the best angle.

601
00:37:55,029 --> 00:38:01,309
Rym: I have is that I argued with Michael Godot twice nah And he actually it got to the point where he kept responding.

602
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,416
Rym: so yeah, I figured I ain't him a little bit.

603
00:38:03,436 --> 00:38:04,440
Rym: yeah, maybe.

604
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:10,280
Rym: But yeah of course right there is the Mojave National Preserve and the Grand Canyon and Death Valley.

605
00:38:10,962 --> 00:38:11,885
Scott: Yeah, Death Valley.

606
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:17,938
Scott: It feels like the best way to experience death valleys is drive through with air conditioning real fast.

607
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:24,340
Rym: So I think the plan is something along the lines if we want to fly into either like Texas or more likely, Arizona.

608
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:31,780
Rym: And then and you can do this I've been looking at I'm trying to find the best deals and everything But you can rent one-way RVs and one-way Winnebagos.

609
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:38,623
Rym: Huh, so we're thinking get an RV or Winnebago or something and then just drive through all the stuff We want to see.

610
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:46,483
Rym: you know tool around the desert hit that hit the Grand Canyon and hit Las Vegas And then from there hike all the way through Death Valley To Reno.

611
00:38:46,564 --> 00:38:49,574
Scott: and you want to walk through Death Valley all the way to Reno.

612
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:54,071
Rym: well hike in the colloquial sense In drive in a Winnebago.

613
00:38:54,131 --> 00:39:00,520
Scott: yeah, I'm like okay You know going for a hike in Death Valley like for a few hours like you know look at some cactuses.

614
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,493
Scott: Avoid some scorpions.

615
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:03,882
Scott: that could be cool You know.

616
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:07,233
Scott: but hike across Death Valley first of all.

617
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:11,414
Scott: that would take our entire vacation in terms of days And I know the much more important.

618
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,985
Rym: We would die Would die.

619
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:14,789
Scott: I wouldn't die me.

620
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:21,355
Rym: I walked for two days in the desert in Israel Two days in the desert in Israel, I don't think you understand how hot Death Valley is.

621
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,527
Scott: I don't know Desert near the equator.

622
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:24,768
Scott: I did.

623
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,074
Scott: can it really get worse than that.

624
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,098
Rym: Death Valley is pretty bad.

625
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:30,551
Scott: Also, I point out as long as you have enough water with you.

626
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:31,515
Scott: It's all good.

627
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:33,443
Scott: and equipment yeah Yeah, I I.

628
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:38,124
Rym: here's the thing with our level of expertise and the amount of strength We have to carry water.

629
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:39,589
Rym: We would die if we tried to.

630
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:39,790
Rym: well.

631
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,535
Scott: We had camels carrying the water.

632
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:45,248
Scott: ah See the camel is very necessary.

633
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:46,474
Scott: so yeah in Death Valley.

634
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,683
Scott: I would have some sort of horse Carrying the water.

635
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:55,380
Rym: I think we sort of a camel motorized horse with wheels perhaps with several hundred horses.

636
00:39:56,166 --> 00:40:03,080
Rym: hundred horses yes Ours is a fire and steel, but we're also thinking I mean there's a lot to do out there.

637
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:17,177
Rym: But pretty much after we had Vegas and all that and drive through Death Valley and go on the final road trip bit Instead of driving all the way up, California because I don't really want to drive all the way up, California We could hook up with one of the penny arcade pegs.

638
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:21,591
Scott: super trips Maybe maybe but we have to I think those super trips.

639
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:23,620
Scott: You know they they start pretty early.

640
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,380
Scott: We'd have to get like on a train somewhere.

641
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:26,266
Scott: I know this.

642
00:40:26,286 --> 00:40:33,900
Scott: there's got to be a train from San Francisco to Seattle But I don't know how long would it take to drive from say Reno to San Francisco or something like ways?

643
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:35,720
Scott: Yeah, it might take like a whole day.

644
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:36,424
Scott: So it's like.

645
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:37,007
Scott: you know.

646
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:43,720
Rym: I don't know if it's gonna be the most efficient use of the time But at the same time it might be fun because we can stop at all those weird places along the way.

647
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:48,539
Scott: Maybe it would be Springs, Tonopah Gibbs maybe you know.

648
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:55,420
Scott: Usually I'm sort of against like travel agents because travel agents tend to you know.

649
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:02,760
Scott: It's sort of like you're paying for something that you could do yourself You know with like AAA, or you know just Google Maps, and it's like what do they really do for you?

650
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:06,485
Scott: But then again you know it's like They know exactly.

651
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:10,420
Scott: you know they have tools that we don't have access to like proprietary travel agent software.

652
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,408
Scott: That could be like this is exactly how long it will take.

653
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:18,419
Rym: or I can just ask my grandpa Who knows the Old West like the back of his hand that works, too?

654
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,580
Rym: You know and and my mom knows where all these like crazy ghost towns are and just things all over, Arizona.

655
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,365
Scott: It's like you know.

656
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:26,740
Scott: the point is to ask someone else who knows more than we do.

657
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:32,080
Scott: Yeah, but not a trap I feel like if we just try to plan it ourselves on Google Maps that we will mess up and not make it in time.

658
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:35,277
Rym: I'm definitely pursuing other angles than Google Maps.

659
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:42,806
Scott: Yeah Yes, I'm also pursuing the the paper map And the the map quest.

660
00:41:42,846 --> 00:41:45,055
Rym: come on we can go to gabs and Tonopah.

661
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:47,410
Scott: Yeah, yante Yes, sir.

662
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:47,836
Scott: I want to go.

663
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:50,340
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty.

664
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,507
Rym: You know those things like you.

665
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:58,214
Scott: You see him for the sky, and it's like they'd like arrange the rocks to look like something.

666
00:41:58,876 --> 00:41:59,197
Scott: Yeah.

667
00:41:59,357 --> 00:41:59,919
Scott: Yeah, where is that?

668
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,954
Scott: South America, okay, not, Nevada, okay, I thought maybe go see that.

669
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:07,900
Rym: no unless we go to South America.

670
00:42:09,623 --> 00:42:14,327
Rym: So I guess I think the real issue the real thing we have to consider is not so much What are we going to do?

671
00:42:14,347 --> 00:42:15,614
Rym: because that's gonna work itself out.

672
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:16,740
Rym: not are we gonna?

673
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,062
Rym: Do it?

674
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:18,394
Rym: because obviously we're doing this.

675
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:18,879
Scott: we're doing it.

676
00:42:19,141 --> 00:42:19,663
Scott: It's a lock.

677
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:26,813
Rym: the question is who among the front row crew has enough balls to come on a week-long Excursion into the wilds of the Southwest?

678
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:31,658
Scott: yeah, I think also for some people It's not just the balls, but it's also the money in the vacation days.

679
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:37,419
Scott: like I know There's some people if they had the vacation days they would do it But they don't and some people they have the days or they don't have the money.

680
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:41,377
Rym: So Emily's the only one with a good excuse because instead of doing this she's going to Finland.

681
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:45,714
Scott: That's fine You know it's all you know, but you know it's not a lot for not.

682
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:48,104
Scott: It's not a lack of some people It's also a lack of.

683
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:50,054
Scott: it's a lack of balls, but forever.

684
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:53,951
Scott: It's It's not a lack of balls for everybody there.

685
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,879
Scott: people have the balls that aren't going despite.

686
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:57,626
Rym: Well we don't know who's going yet, or not.

687
00:42:57,666 --> 00:43:03,762
Rym: all I know is that some people are particularly excited and some people seem really Reluctant.

688
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:08,239
Rym: yeah, and I wonder how many people we'd have along with us if we were going to Turkey instead of this.

689
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:09,773
Scott: Yeah, well what if we had?

690
00:43:09,814 --> 00:43:10,440
Scott: you know well?

691
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:16,080
Scott: You know if we had a zillion dollars right everyone had a zillion dollars and infinite vacation and no jobs.

692
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:17,246
Scott: How many people would be up for?

693
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:18,071
Scott: probably everybody.

694
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:22,553
Rym: well, then I would try I wouldn't go to the Southwest I'd be in Europe pretty much to be living in the Mediterranean.

695
00:43:22,654 --> 00:43:24,824
Scott: I'd be in the Southwest at some point Everywhere.

696
00:43:24,945 --> 00:43:26,814
Rym: oh yeah, but I'd spend a lot of time in Monaco.

697
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:40,426
Scott: Oh Monica Yeah, I might spend like a month there Living in the hotel that is also a casino Playing baccarat watching Formula One races Which is once a year.

698
00:43:40,446 --> 00:43:43,400
Rym: if you had that much money you could buy your way into racing in Formula One races.

699
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,511
Scott: No formula one team is like five hundred million dollars.

700
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:48,860
Rym: if I use that zillions, okay?

701
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,977
Scott: If I have zillion I didn't know a zillion was bigger than five I can buy.

702
00:43:52,198 --> 00:44:00,354
Rym: if I have Effectively Monte Cristo money I can buy an f1 team and then pay them to put me in the car until I die which won't Take long, so you'll die.

703
00:44:00,394 --> 00:44:03,689
Rym: practice one Maybe not practice one cuz I'd probably go.

704
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:04,051
Scott: you're right.

705
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:04,372
Scott: You're right.

706
00:44:04,412 --> 00:44:04,814
Scott: You died.

707
00:44:04,854 --> 00:44:08,219
Rym: go so I would drive So slowly that the engine would catch fire.

708
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,303
Scott: That's not well.

709
00:44:10,323 --> 00:44:18,179
Scott: first of all if you drove that slowly the brakes would catch fire first right and second It's not even worth discussing this.

710
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:21,919
Rym: Maybe we should just do our go-karts.

711
00:44:22,584 --> 00:44:26,799
Rym: Yes, let's stick to the go-karts, but yes We'll probably talk about this more as time goes on.

712
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,380
Rym: But we are going west and good or bad may come of it.

713
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,494
Scott: We're going to PAX no matter what PAX people at the if all else fails.

714
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:37,139
Scott: We'll just fly to Seattle and fly home.
