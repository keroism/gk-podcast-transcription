00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,616
Scott: It's Wednesday January night.

2
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:12,699
Rym: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,988
Scott: I'm Rym and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,783
Scott: We review bone.

5
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:34,090
Rym: Let's do this So this weekend if all goes according to plan and I have not put much planning into this yet.

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,159
Rym: But but someone else has someone else names.

7
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:38,490
Scott: Yeah, you have made the mistake of relying on others.

8
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,279
Scott: Well, the thing is sake we do not often.

9
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,370
Rym: my really just didn't expect this day to come.

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,462
Scott: But you see a lesson you should have learned.

11
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:49,935
Rym: I have not skied in About a decade.

12
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:51,340
Scott: I don't know if skied is a word.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,110
Scott: I think you're supposed to say guns have gone skiing.

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,896
Rym: Well, no, I have not undertaken the.

15
00:00:55,996 --> 00:00:59,970
Rym: I've not gone skiing nor have I skied the verb ski.

16
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,428
Rym: I have in fact not skied since I lived in Michigan.

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,674
Scott: Have a water skiing.

18
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:09,787
Rym: water skiing is not the same thing, but I'm saying it's still skiing.

19
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:10,289
Rym: Yes.

20
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:10,630
Rym: You know what?

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,894
Rym: I have not water skied either.

22
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:12,897
Scott: Well, I ski do?

23
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:14,883
Rym: I have not done that either.

24
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:15,906
Scott: have a ski ball.

25
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:17,310
Rym: I've played ski ball.

26
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:18,438
Scott: Oh you skied.

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,290
Rym: no because I would have ski balled.

28
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:23,578
Scott: Anyway, I think those are all skiing.

29
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:26,770
Rym: you need to be more specific as I have not skied in so long.

30
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:37,364
Rym: but the other Scott when I said you know I'm Larry of suddenly going skiing again because I haven't skied in a been over a decade and He says as skis like riding a bike.

31
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:41,341
Rym: He'll be fine Yeah, and I said, you know what you're right.

32
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:43,829
Rym: and then I went and bought the stuff I needed to go skiing.

33
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:50,090
Rym: and Then the funny thing is I went to buy the ski jacket and the guys like yeah, there's gonna be no snow in, Pennsylvania.

34
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,874
Rym: What are you thinking?

35
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:57,079
Rym: So, uh, I'm assured wherever we're going There's snow and we're gonna go skiing.

36
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:00,670
Rym: and if I don't come back on Monday, you can assume that I'm in the hospital.

37
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:12,419
Scott: Well, you know For having you know Even if you haven't gone skiing in a long time if there's gonna be just like shitty shitty crap snow Right and you go to some crap ass ski places.

38
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,945
Scott: That's not so bad cuz it'll be cheaper.

39
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:23,569
Scott: It'll be less crowded and You can get back into skiing and then save your money and your precious weekends for a high quality ski.

40
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,310
Scott: Well the one sometime later after your skills have improved.

41
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,495
Rym: Well, we had an alternate plan.

42
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:30,909
Rym: if the skiing socks we can just sit in the lounge and drink all day.

43
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:32,058
Scott: That's it.

44
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:38,150
Rym: you can do that too, yeah But I think the one thing that might help me out is that I you know, I lived in Michigan.

45
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,933
Rym: I skied on.

46
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:43,630
Rym: almost all the skiing ever did was in Michigan and we don't get powder so much in Michigan.

47
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,180
Rym: Not that the stuff you want to ski on.

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,509
Rym: we basically get ice.

49
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:58,369
Rym: So hopefully the fact that I've skied on nothing but the shittiest of snow my entire life Well, my entire skiing life will allow me to not die this weekend when I'm skiing on ice.

50
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,656
Scott: See my 60-degree weather.

51
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:02,963
Scott: Yeah, I have the guaranteed not die plan.

52
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:04,488
Rym: Oh, yeah, it's called Scott's patented.

53
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:05,150
Rym: I'm a wuss.

54
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,640
Scott: It's called don't go skiing and instead do something else.

55
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:18,190
Scott: like what skiing is sitting in front of the computer skiing Nice and safe when I comfortable Nice and warm - and I skied on a semi-regular basis.

56
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,421
Rym: It was pretty much the best thing in the world.

57
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:22,049
Rym: skiing is a fantastic sport.

58
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:23,818
Scott: It's an okay sport.

59
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:26,470
Rym: downhill skiing cross-country skiing is not as fun.

60
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:31,170
Scott: It's not a bad sport, but at the same time it is far too dangerous for my taste.

61
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:38,048
Rym: It's not dangerous unless you suck or don't learn how to do it right or are really weak.

62
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:39,513
Rym: if you're really weak It's dangerous.

63
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:43,290
Scott: more people have gotten hurt or killed skiing than racecar driving.

64
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:45,729
Rym: So yeah But you got to look at the demographic.

65
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:58,954
Rym: More people get hurt on the the black diamond who probably shouldn't be on the black diamond or falling off the ski lift because they Feel I'm not I have evidence of this, but I'm pretty sure like I've seen more Professional skiing people.

66
00:03:58,974 --> 00:03:59,500
Scott: I don't know.

67
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,980
Scott: I guess it maybe it's kind of close have more professional skiing people gotten hurt or professional racecar driving people gotten hurt.

68
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:13,859
Rym: You know, it's hard to say but I can say definitely that people a lot Recreationally get hurt a lot partly because a lot of them are really really stupid.

69
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,524
Rym: I God, all right.

70
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:21,925
Rym: Anyway, it's anime day and this this news kind of came out of nowhere Talking about any anime today.

71
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:23,469
Rym: We're gonna talk about anime.

72
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:29,943
Rym: All right, so a new type USA is a fairly venerable Publication in the u.s.

73
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:34,436
Rym: It's I mean it began what when we went to Otakon the first or second time.

74
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:38,589
Scott: second thing was 2002 I think late to the February.

75
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:39,432
Scott: I don't remember.

76
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:41,860
Rym: Yeah, it's actually a relatively new anime publication.

77
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,087
Rym: The thing is it is but I don't know maybe five years That's not that long.

78
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,280
Rym: Yeah, it's but it's no proto culture.

79
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:57,069
Rym: But it was based on new type in Japan and I remember before new type USA was Released in the US in English.

80
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,680
Rym: I was fascinated by new type.

81
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:05,159
Scott: Oh, yeah Cuz I mean I didn't even you know the idea that there would be actually a magazine just about anime.

82
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,325
Scott: something So obscure was.

83
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:15,028
Rym: it was insane, you know, so no there were other magazines I was talking about more the point that if you don't understand Japanese and you open a new type I was gonna talk about that too.

84
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:17,137
Rym: So it looks like it's the most fantastic thing ever.

85
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:21,856
Rym: It's beautiful Just pictures and beautiful like yeah shots of every show into anime club.

86
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,580
Scott: and they had new type magazines There's like what the hell is this and it's this huge magazine.

87
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:34,960
Scott: Every page is printed with amazing quality with these amazing images of all these anime I've never seen or heard of and all this information about anime that I can't read.

88
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:41,328
Scott: But I imagined that if I could read it it was giving me all this information I couldn't get anywhere else and it was amazing and I wanted to know.

89
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:46,905
Rym: so new type was released in America in English as new type USA and it had.

90
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:52,180
Scott: it had some articles by US people some articles that we just translated from the Japanese new type.

91
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:56,054
Rym: Well, the thing is I subscribed to it right away and I got the first one and it was great.

92
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,925
Rym: and then I got okay I thought it was great.

93
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:08,140
Rym: And then right about right before I got my first mailed one in the mail I I was reading it again and I realized that I hadn't actually read any words.

94
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:12,560
Rym: I just flipped through it the same way I flipped through the Japanese one and I had this revelation of wait a minute.

95
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:16,119
Rym: I can read all those words Oh, man.

96
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:23,740
Rym: And I proceeded to discover that there was not a single word worth reading in new type USA.

97
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:41,000
Scott: Well, the issues that I read which were like a handful of the earlier issues of new type USA some of the little tiny blurb kind of things in the back contains somewhat obscure kinds of information and Articles that you really wouldn't find anywhere else and that was somewhat interesting.

98
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,919
Rym: But like those big shots of like a page with all the characters from an anime and then I'm like and four pages about this Anime that's coming out that text wasn't saying it.

99
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,161
Rym: Yes the

100
00:06:49,302 --> 00:07:03,077
Scott: vast majority of it was completely useless and as soon as I you know Thanks to things like anime news network where I can find out about about all the upcoming shows New type USA really didn't have much of a use because I already knew most of the stuff that it was telling me.

101
00:07:03,097 --> 00:07:05,920
Rym: I unsubscribed Before the first issue.

102
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,580
Rym: Unsubscribe Just didn't pay was gonna tell that story.

103
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,475
Rym: I unsubscribed before the first one came because before the first one came the bill came.

104
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:21,900
Rym: since being a college student I had checked bill me later and I decided well, I'm just now paying for new type.

105
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:23,024
Rym: That's the end of this.

106
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:29,920
Rym: and I stopped getting new type and I. there have been fewer more worthless publications.

107
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:31,905
Rym: The new type USA.

108
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:37,160
Scott: no, you know as you as bad as new type USA was as somewhat useless as it is.

109
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:40,151
Scott: It is far from being the most useless magazine.

110
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:40,572
Rym: I don't know.

111
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:42,580
Rym: soldier of fortune is wonderful.

112
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:46,800
Rym: I mean, how else would I know how I can be a badass in like Zimbabwe?

113
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,011
Scott: It's an okay magazine, but there are many worse magazines trust.

114
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:53,660
Rym: Don't forget car and driver or a golf digest.

115
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:55,530
Scott: Plenty of work anybody.

116
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:05,519
Rym: this way new type USA Was was like the biggest for me scam ever because what like it's like it looked so great and then it turns out that those Words didn't say anything.

117
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:09,396
Scott: Anyway, you're gonna tell the news about new type USA is fucking done.

118
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,300
Rym: That's what the news is.

119
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:17,320
Rym: It's done as of February now according to anime news network They're not sure if it's February or March because the details are scant.

120
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:23,700
Scott: well Because what happens is every magazine in the United States is stupid and they ship like the March issue in February.

121
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:25,029
Scott: And the you know, it's like.

122
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:33,299
Scott: I never understood why the fuck they do that I'm printing the lead time for printing the lead time for distribution, but just change the month that's written on it.

123
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,102
Scott: It's not hard.

124
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:39,719
Scott: If you know, it's gonna ship in March right March on it, you know, which one is shipping in which month?

125
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,373
Rym: Because the news in it is all from the previous month.

126
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:44,980
Rym: That's to how publications work.

127
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,742
Scott: So you just it.

128
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:52,024
Scott: so instead of you know, pretending to act like you're actually having providing something useful and up-to-date You're just not even.

129
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:53,750
Scott: you're just completely saying a fuck it.

130
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,593
Scott: We know we're shit.

131
00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:56,280
Scott: We're super delayed news.

132
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,786
Scott: That's a month late and completely useless.

133
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:59,572
Scott: Let's just write the old month on there.

134
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,580
Rym: I don't think that's a legitimate criticism.

135
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:11,320
Rym: I think just a cranky weirdo Magazine that the month of the magazine comes up to new newsstands as opposed to when the stuff in the magazine is from.

136
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:15,131
Scott: Actually, I think what most magazines write like the month after like.

137
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,636
Scott: I think the March ships in February.

138
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:17,780
Scott: I don't know it's it's stupid.

139
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:18,748
Rym: It's stupid.

140
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,200
Rym: I don't think it's stupid at all.

141
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,903
Scott: I think it's stupid.

142
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,436
Scott: So in February you want the March magazine to show up.

143
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,825
Rym: I don't care I don't care what month it says.

144
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:27,989
Rym: I read the magazine.

145
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,176
Scott: I don't read any magazines cuz they're stupid.

146
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:33,025
Rym: I don't care you're you hate everything.

147
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:43,960
Rym: so but uh new type USA was worth hating and now it's gone and Theoretically, they're planning to replace it with something but they didn't say what see that that actually that's very telling.

148
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:50,160
Scott: If ADV is getting rid of new type USA, right, but they plan on coming out with another magazine.

149
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:59,640
Scott: Right that tells me that they actually Figured like, you know, their calculation is that they were making money off of it or they would make money off of it.

150
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,280
Scott: But they were probably paying some license fee, you know for the new type name.

151
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:08,694
Scott: And they are probably paying to get like a lot of new type content and images and stuff.

152
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:23,025
Scott: and I think they're probably bargaining That if They get the same number of subscribers to their new magazine And they don't have to pay all those fees for the content and the licensing from new type Japan or whatever Getting any content from there.

153
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:25,952
Rym: Anyway, they were they did not content.

154
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:26,975
Rym: They were getting pictures.

155
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,439
Scott: They were getting content.

156
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,600
Rym: now I I would barely classify anything in new type is content.

157
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:41,373
Scott: Well, you know, that's the question is that there was a lot of things in new type USA that were translated articles from new type Japan Articles in Japan either.

158
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,977
Rym: what I don't get is why would anyone in Japan read new type?

159
00:10:43,997 --> 00:10:45,760
Scott: I don't know they're otaku.

160
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,301
Scott: What do you want?

161
00:10:46,803 --> 00:11:00,592
Rym: but the really interesting thing and this is pointed out here on anime news network But no one knows what new type circulation was because like every stupid Industry thing in all of anime in the u.s.

162
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,480
Rym: No one publishes any information.

163
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,603
Rym: They keep everything secret.

164
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:15,420
Rym: So people guess that new type had between 50,000 and 75,000 Subscribers, but no one knows and no anime magazine publishes Jack, so we can't really say anything beyond that.

165
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:30,099
Scott: Yeah, I really just don't understand these people keeping it a secret like oh people were know we're doing shidley or they'll know we're doing well, and it's like What do you care that if you're if you're doing shidley people knowing you're doing shidley isn't gonna hurt you.

166
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:32,354
Scott: You're gonna do shidley no matter what.

167
00:11:32,414 --> 00:11:35,229
Scott: and if you're doing well You should brag about how well you're doing.

168
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:36,294
Scott: is that you might do better.

169
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:38,162
Scott: I Don't know.

170
00:11:38,182 --> 00:11:38,744
Rym: huh new type.

171
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:43,218
Rym: Yeah, there's a picture of me in you and that's about all I can say about you.

172
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,958
Scott: Yeah All right.

173
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:47,188
Scott: So I know I was gonna do.

174
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,300
Scott: I probably had a good news, but I didn't want to look for it.

175
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,585
Scott: So I'm gonna do a geek back.

176
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:52,894
Scott: I've decided not geek bite big bite.

177
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:54,300
Rym: Why do you keep saying geek bag?

178
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,962
Scott: I don't know.

179
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,107
Scott: It's a better word.

180
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:56,789
Scott: Yeah.

181
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,400
Rym: Anyway, I think you came up with geek bite.

182
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:00,747
Scott: I came up with both of them.

183
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,937
Rym: Well, you should have should have chosen better.

184
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:15,400
Scott: Yes anyway I've decided that there usually aren't a lot of good news is on Wednesday and we usually just read anime news network because it's the Only website with anime news and there's a new type USA is going away.

185
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,800
Scott: Yeah, that's a good news, but there's only once and occasionally there's a you know an underwear pervert news from like newsarama.

186
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:21,358
Scott: But that's it.

187
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,466
Scott: So I'm doing more geek bites on Wednesdays because I read a lot of comics and things that you know Doesn't read.

188
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:27,889
Scott: so I got.

189
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,079
Scott: I got to get him out to you, right?

190
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:34,472
Scott: So in my box of comics this month came this comic called wanton soup.

191
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:35,454
Scott: You like wanton soup.

192
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:36,297
Rym: I do.

193
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:39,849
Scott: All right by James stoke away.

194
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:41,338
Scott: I probably said his name wrong.

195
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:54,300
Scott: st Okay, oh e it's an oni press which is the same people who publish Scott Pilgrim and the same format is Scott Pilgrim You know, it's a. it's a you know, little manga size digest deal, but it's printed left to right because it's you know American.

196
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:54,966
Scott: It's not a manga.

197
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,500
Scott: It's just a comic book like Scott Pilgrim.

198
00:12:57,923 --> 00:13:00,260
Scott: The artistic style it's pretty good arts.

199
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,653
Scott: there's some you know, it's got manga style paneling and such.

200
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:12,440
Scott: but the art style is sort of gorillas ish and like punk kids styling and It's not the greatest comic in the world.

201
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,140
Scott: I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie, but it's just sort of fun and sort of happy.

202
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:30,699
Scott: basically, the story is this guy named Johnny boyo, yeah great name and He's got a friend deacon vans and deacon vans loves the ladies and Johnny boyo loves cooking and they're truckers in space

203
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,372
Rym: uh-huh,

204
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:49,087
Scott: and basically, it turns into Johnny boyo goes back to his cooking school that he dropped out of to become a space trucker and It's all sort of like initial D but with cooking and but it's not you know that and alone I mean that's been done before.

205
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:53,758
Scott: there's plenty of cooking animes and things, you know Ironwalk whatever and such like that, right?

206
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:08,057
Scott: But because this is in space all of the things they cook are like completely made-up alien dishes and people are using like alien he like has to cook against aliens who have like, you know, two bodies and extra arms and legs and the.

207
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:16,999
Scott: the tasting judge is a giant tongue and It's not really, you know amazing or anything, but it's just fun and I enjoyed it.

208
00:14:17,461 --> 00:14:21,568
Scott: so if you think you'd like that, this is a Cheap.

209
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,869
Scott: it's 12 bucks From only press.

210
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,179
Scott: it's probably in stores near you.

211
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:27,916
Scott: wonton soup.

212
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:52,634
Rym: Anyway things of the day now, uh, this was announced at CES and normally I talk about this on a Monday But I have to talk about this on a Wednesday because it does not bode Well for people who do not want to see certain things that anime conventions There has always been.

213
00:14:52,734 --> 00:15:04,630
Rym: kind of one of the holy grails of cell phones for people who are nuts about cell phones is What if my cell phone were also a projector and I just project video onto a surface?

214
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:12,990
Scott: It's not something that's always been a holy grail But there have been many companies developing such technology and demonstrating it sort of like people have been making and demonstrating.

215
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:27,524
Scott: You know flexible papers and things like that, you know It's one of those technologies that people are always showing off at trade shows and you know showing development versions of it and Stuff like that, but no one ever actually makes it happen for real.

216
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:29,190
Scott: I'm real consumer products.

217
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:31,639
Scott: It's just something always you see auditing on and gadget.

218
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,309
Scott: you see pictures on the internet, but it never comes to life.

219
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:44,970
Rym: now the situation here is that it exists and it pretty much works and Very rich people and people who really really care are gonna start having these things in the relatively near future.

220
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:52,150
Rym: Now what is going to happen gonna give you a little look into the future is going to be the same thing that happened when?

221
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,782
Rym: Laser pens came into existence.

222
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:56,189
Scott: We're talking like two three years from now.

223
00:15:56,611 --> 00:16:02,128
Rym: I mean basically laser pens existed, but they were really really expensive and they were kind of useless.

224
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:09,679
Rym: so fancy-pants professors and people who had way too much money and way too little sense own laser pens and They use them to impress people.

225
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,330
Rym: when they gave you know presentations.

226
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,078
Scott: They used them for science experiment.

227
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:17,967
Rym: very few people because if you were doing a science experiment You probably just had a laser we used.

228
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:24,010
Scott: well No, we used them in like middle school to do like, you know tests of like refraction and stuff like that.

229
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,813
Rym: Wow in middle school.

230
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,581
Rym: We just had like argon lasers.

231
00:16:27,264 --> 00:16:28,550
Scott: Ah, we had laser pens.

232
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:41,540
Rym: But anyway laser pens eventually got under $100 and once they were less than $100 and you could buy them in Radio Shack for like 70 80 bucks Every kid in the goddamn world had a laser pen.

233
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,228
Rym: you would walk down the street and there'd be red dots everywhere.

234
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,506
Rym: to be red Dots in people's living rooms because the kid across the street is shooting it from the roof.

235
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:51,210
Rym: go to a movie theater There'd be 50 red dots on the face.

236
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:55,703
Rym: It just it went nuts and if I like about a month or two eventually died down.

237
00:16:55,743 --> 00:17:00,126
Scott: the novelty ended but also the police Threats sort of made it die down.

238
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:06,869
Rym: also I think the only reason it really ended was that people explored all of the things you could do with a laser pen not much.

239
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:08,027
Rym: And that was the end of it.

240
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:16,329
Rym: now Imagine if instead of projecting a little red dot you could project full motion 24 frame-per-second yaoi.

241
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,444
Scott: Great, of course, you know if it's the lights are bright.

242
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:21,810
Scott: It's probably not gonna be too visible.

243
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:35,650
Rym: Oh, no But you're gonna be in a showing room and you're gonna be trying to watch a kuji bk Unbalanced and then suddenly there's gonna be penises all over all the walls Not to mention it won't work from too far away from the wall.

244
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,309
Scott: So someone ought to be sitting right near the wall to make it work and to make it.

245
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,631
Scott: You know

246
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:52,725
Rym: the thing is I'm interested to see exactly what happens with all this because you know There's always that guy or that girl at the anime con who's sitting there in the hallway and a lot of times you'll see them Multiple days in the same spot and they'll have like their laptop and on their laptop.

247
00:17:52,745 --> 00:18:08,048
Rym: They've got all the anime music videos They downloaded from somewhere or they've got like DDR and they just sit there playing DDR with their fingers not even on a pad or Watching these music videos or watching these fan subs Attempting to gather crowds and eventually they will.

248
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:11,521
Rym: I love these little pockets of people kind of surrounding these attention whores.

249
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:14,130
Scott: try and I there's that one guy who does it.

250
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,197
Scott: I think it Katsucon and a ConnectiCon.

251
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:22,062
Scott: he just sets up his little computer and he plays stuff and people sit around Watching it and he's like gets all into it.

252
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:23,229
Scott: He's a very strange man.

253
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:28,286
Rym: There's gonna be a lot more of that once these things start getting more commonplace.

254
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:30,932
Rym: So be Warned.

255
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,950
Scott: yeah in two or three years anime conventions gonna get scary.

256
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:41,389
Scott: You know that it's gonna be real scary when like the iPhone has a projector and you just aim the iPhone at the wall And then the video you bought on iTunes shows up.

257
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,393
Rym: I mean at least luckily for now, we're not gonna have to worry too much because the people who buy these are gonna be You know attention.

258
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:48,062
Rym: Oh my god, check out my thing.

259
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:55,169
Rym: the same people have iPhones now But at the same time they'll be relatively rare and I'm not too worried, but give it a couple years and yeah.

260
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:57,243
Scott: But yeah this year you should.

261
00:18:57,727 --> 00:19:04,088
Scott: this year You will see at least one phone become available somewhere in the world that has a projector in it to consumers.

262
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,853
Scott: scary All right.

263
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:07,159
Scott: That was your thing of the day not a news.

264
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:07,501
Scott: Yeah.

265
00:19:07,742 --> 00:19:09,249
Scott: Okay, so check this out.

266
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,141
Scott: Apparently this is this is as reported by Kotaku.

267
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:16,190
Scott: So whatever but they got it from a Japanese site, which is linked.

268
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:19,728
Rym: Oh, so some guy on the internet in Japan pictures just pictures.

269
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:37,688
Scott: basically, they they have word that criminals are Hunting Japanese otaku, right because there have been like cases in Japan of like, you know otaku getting stabbed and otaku getting mugged and Otaku are being targeted by criminals, right?

270
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:47,130
Scott: Apparently police in Shinjuku have been stopping people who look like otaku and subjecting them to like spot checks.

271
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,080
Scott: So they'll be like the anyone who looks like an otaku.

272
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,679
Scott: the police see them they stop them and then they search them for you Illegal stuffs, right?

273
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,965
Scott: I guess you can do that in Japan.

274
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:56,930
Scott: I wouldn't fly in the u.s.

275
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,780
Rym: But wait a minute, but I thought the otaku were the victims.

276
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:07,750
Scott: So that's why it makes no sense, but apparently a Supposed police list describes what types of individuals?

277
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,779
Scott: Cops should check right?

278
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,130
Scott: So here's the list of criteria.

279
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,482
Scott: The police in Japan are looking forward to see who they should check you ready.

280
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:18,338
Rym: aside from the fact that this is creepy police state Action, this ought to be hilarious.

281
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,699
Scott: people wearing camouflage trousers or jackets People with chains or keys hanging off the trousers.

282
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,103
Rym: Yeah, people who look weak.

283
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:33,054
Scott: Yeah people wearing a bandana people wearing leather leather so Basically, that's like.

284
00:20:33,294 --> 00:20:38,309
Scott: apparently that's a lot of otaku in Japan apparently meet those descriptions.

285
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:41,398
Rym: Wow Should we give the list of what an American otaku is?

286
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,682
Rym: Yeah, I don't know.

287
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,470
Rym: kind of chubby kind of flabby kind of pale.

288
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:48,583
Rym: Yeah, anyway a million shots keys hanging from their keychain.

289
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,010
Rym: Yeah and a bus pass.

290
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:55,270
Scott: so To see if those rumors right were true, right?

291
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,462
Scott: This guy went to Shinjuku and he Drake.

292
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:00,350
Scott: he followed all of those rules.

293
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:07,210
Scott: He where he wore camouflage pants and Chad chains with keys and he had a bandana and like a leather jacket.

294
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:16,616
Scott: Well, yeah the whole thing right to see if he got stopped and he did get stopped Right, but he put a note in his back He was wearing a backpack to that.

295
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:21,797
Scott: the police would obviously want to search right and in that backpack He was only one thing.

296
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:25,070
Scott: It was a note that said bummer failure.

297
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,197
Scott: So, yeah check this out.

298
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:35,841
Scott: is either a picture of him holding up the note and there's a picture of him with the police on The note and it's it's pretty funny.

299
00:21:35,941 --> 00:21:40,889
Rym: So if this is legitimate then the Japan - - cuz that's not cool.

300
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:45,986
Rym: Yeah, and I still don't it makes no sense that if otaku were being targets of crime.

301
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:47,250
Rym: Why would they target otaku?

302
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,317
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

303
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:50,130
Scott: it could be something that's lost in translation.

304
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:57,130
Rym: Maybe they think that otaku or I don't know doing bad things and then the criminal elements are targeting them because of that.

305
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,669
Rym: Maybe they think people are dressing up like otaku to do these things.

306
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:06,144
Scott: I have no idea but that's that's what it says here and I have to.

307
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:07,810
Scott: I can't read the Japanese site.

308
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,993
Scott: Someone else can try to read it.

309
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:09,876
Scott: See what it really says.

310
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:11,360
Scott: But yeah great.

311
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,354
Rym: So anyway tonight we're gonna talk about yet again a Comic book.

312
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:17,257
Rym: Holy shit.

313
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:19,464
Scott: Oh snap rims reading the comics.

314
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,809
Rym: We'll see how long this lasts.

315
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,517
Scott: Yeah So what comic are we gonna talk about?

316
00:22:23,537 --> 00:22:25,144
Rym: Oh, you want me to introduce it?

317
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:26,429
Scott: Yeah, we could introduce it.

318
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:30,706
Rym: Well this thing it's something that I think most people are aware exists.

319
00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:34,162
Rym: I mean even when I was a kid I remember seeing this you're like, oh, it's that thing.

320
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:34,806
Rym: I know about that.

321
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:35,509
Scott: you were a kid.

322
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:41,620
Rym: Well when I was when I was a kid, I mean before college Uh-huh, and I think oh it's that thing.

323
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,350
Rym: everyone like you'd see it in places and you'd hear about it.

324
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:50,702
Rym: a lot of people who were into comics talked about it, but Never read it and I didn't know a lot of people who had read it.

325
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:52,329
Rym: So I didn't really know much about it.

326
00:22:52,792 --> 00:23:01,510
Scott: Yeah, I mean when I saw this around, you know Like basically I saw images of it I could recognize it and I didn't know what it was called and later I did know what it was called.

327
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:08,762
Scott: But I sort of I sort of like associated it with like, you know Johnny the homicidal maniac and and all those sort.

328
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:13,070
Scott: I thought it was one of those kind of comics You know for like, you know the punk goth kids.

329
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,750
Scott: It was that I thought it was one of their kind of things and I didn't really know about it.

330
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:21,988
Scott: I think a lot of people in general Recognize if they see it, they recognize it.

331
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:22,170
Scott: they go.

332
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:27,430
Scott: I've seen that somewhere But you don't really know what it is or maybe you know what it's called except for people who've read it.

333
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,816
Rym: I don't know.

334
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:32,456
Rym: my mice was different in that, you know I'd always go to comic shops because I was.

335
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:37,833
Rym: I kind of wanted to get into comic books and I always see it there and I read.

336
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:44,270
Rym: I think like one of the issues I didn't know it was this giant continuous story and I just didn't I don't know.

337
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:51,449
Scott: Yep, so we're talking about today is bone by Jeff Smith and only Jeff Smith and no one else.

338
00:23:52,031 --> 00:24:00,294
Rym: Bone is the story of three bones from Bonville who leave Bonville and go on an epic journey and eventually Return to Bonville.

339
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:06,449
Scott: Yeah, you should go and search on the internet and you'll see what these bone Characters look like and you'll go.

340
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:08,415
Scott: Oh that's what you guys talking about.

341
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:21,908
Scott: in case you don't know already cuz I'm sure if you're a geek you've seen this before somewhere and If you'd haven't realized this they're called bones because well They look like bones and they're from Bonville and their names are smiley bone phony bone and phone bone.

342
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:26,361
Rym: Yep Now I finally read it and bone is really this kind of.

343
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:32,710
Rym: it's not what I expected based on even what I'd read before And just on you know what you expect from those kind of characters.

344
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,322
Scott: Yeah, you look at the cover of this comic and or any you have to you.

345
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:40,994
Scott: really you cannot guess even what genre This thing is.

346
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:42,784
Scott: but when you actually read it you go.

347
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:45,436
Scott: Oh And it you it's a job.

348
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:47,364
Scott: It's not like a surprise or anything.

349
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:48,910
Scott: It's not like something new and original.

350
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:52,010
Scott: It's you know, it's a. it's a type of story that has been told before.

351
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:54,838
Scott: It's just not what you would expect from looking at it.

352
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:55,159
Rym: it.

353
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,477
Rym: to sum it up bone is basically just a straight-up Fantasy.

354
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:04,899
Scott: it's an all-ages Epic adventure fantasy story, that's what it is.

355
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:16,570
Rym: It just so happens that the three main characters are Extremely stylized and really don't fit in with the entire rest of the comic at all.

356
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:20,883
Rym: Yep, but other than that, it's just a straight-up fantasy comic and that's the end of it.

357
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:23,955
Scott: Well, it's a very long Straight up.

358
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:24,799
Rym: It is very long.

359
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,126
Rym: It was over 50 issues.

360
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:28,756
Scott: Yeah, this thing it was a lot.

361
00:25:28,776 --> 00:25:38,630
Scott: it there was basically this came out a lot of issues like 50 something issues and it came Out over the course of a long number of years and there was no regular schedule wasn't like monthly.

362
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:40,037
Scott: It was an issue came out.

363
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:41,324
Scott: They waited a bunch.

364
00:25:41,545 --> 00:25:42,450
Scott: another issue came out.

365
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,143
Scott: Can you imagine of trying to read this when it was coming out in issues?

366
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:46,510
Scott: It would have been so painful.

367
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:48,497
Scott: You know you would have been over 10 years.

368
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:52,150
Scott: you'd be getting an issue and having no clue when the next issue was coming.

369
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:59,670
Scott: Right, but now you can get all of bone in one volume one tremendous vine, which is what I have.

370
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:05,330
Scott: Which is what we read which is the bone one volume edition and it's this gigantic fat paperback book.

371
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,719
Scott: It's actually relatively cheap for what you get.

372
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:10,270
Scott: It's black and white and it's every issue.

373
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:16,308
Rym: I'd highly recommend if you want to read bone and you'll probably want to read bone because it's pretty enjoyable That you get that.

374
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:22,483
Scott: Yeah Because you don't want 50 or so little issue that are gonna be hard to get now if you're wealthy.

375
00:26:22,824 --> 00:26:28,910
Scott: if you are wealthy you can get each Individual chapter of bone right and it's either separate volumes.

376
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:30,549
Scott: I don't think all the volumes are out yet.

377
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:36,370
Scott: You can get it in color because they're releasing these color volumes chapter by chapter, and they haven't done all the chapters.

378
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,173
Scott: Maybe they have.

379
00:26:37,674 --> 00:26:43,161
Scott: you can buy color chapters instead of the one big black and white volume if you really want color And you're willing to pay for it.

380
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:43,646
Scott: They have it.

381
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:47,156
Scott: so What else are we gonna say about bone?

382
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:48,783
Rym: well the story is actually.

383
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:49,546
Rym: there's some.

384
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,890
Rym: there's a lot of interesting I guess things to talk about related to bone.

385
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:58,370
Rym: I kind of want to avoid talking about the plot in any great death because it goes so far from where it begins.

386
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:58,855
Scott: Well, we could.

387
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:05,590
Scott: we could talk about the beginning of the plot though The premise is you have this place called Boneville and there's these bones living there, right?

388
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,094
Rym: But you don't even start with that.

389
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:10,344
Rym: you start with three bones who have been run out of Boneville.

390
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:14,619
Rym: Yeah, because one of them Epically failed to run for mayor.

391
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:16,830
Scott: I was about to say that they were run out of Boneville.

392
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:19,137
Scott: So these three bones got run out of town.

393
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:27,830
Scott: So they're basically exiled and they're in this middle of nowhere and Eventually, they end up somewhere else where the story takes place.

394
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:36,322
Rym: Yeah it's kind of like they get lost and they wander around and they end up in this kind of Normal fantasy world where everyone looks like a normal fantasy character.

395
00:27:36,342 --> 00:27:38,730
Rym: Yeah, three of them look like comic book characters.

396
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:44,653
Scott: It's almost like an escaflowne a kind of transported to a fantasy world story except they're not Transported.

397
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:56,156
Rym: they just walk to one and that they didn't know was there and then the snows fall and they can't get back and then They get separated and caught up in this kind of crazy Escalating story that it gets.

398
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,760
Rym: it gets very epic toward the end.

399
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:01,010
Scott: I think the two things I like most about bone, right?

400
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,173
Scott: well, first of all, the art is Cart.

401
00:28:04,253 --> 00:28:04,815
Scott: it's like the.

402
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:13,685
Scott: I can't really imagine art that takes fantasy But also like cartoonish art and combines it in such a way in which they can.

403
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:19,444
Scott: you know at times the art will be like Whoa, and at other times it could be funny and it it totally works.

404
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:20,247
Scott: I don't know.

405
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:21,130
Scott: It's just myth.

406
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:29,589
Rym: I think that my favorite thing is that the boat like you'll get really into it and whenever something like one of the bones gets Punched or something or it's something frightening or horrible happens.

407
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:39,426
Rym: They'll often make this face where their eyes go buggy with a dot in the middle and their mouth kind of goes open and it's Such a cartoony thing, but I cracked up out loud every time I saw it.

408
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:40,349
Rym: It just fits so well.

409
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:43,824
Scott: Also, one thing I like is that there are dragons in this story.

410
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:45,210
Scott: Oh awesome drag.

411
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:51,457
Rym: I think I have to point out that the way dragons are portrayed in bone is Exactly how I like dragons to be part.

412
00:28:51,477 --> 00:28:51,939
Scott: I think that's.

413
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,130
Scott: everyone says that is pretty much that it's a fantasy story.

414
00:28:55,471 --> 00:29:00,110
Scott: There's dragons there's magic there's wizards and warlocks and whatnot, right?

415
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:10,260
Rym: But the one dragon that you see the dragon that is involved in the story the most of all the other drag is the most Even-keeled thing you will ever see in anywhere the best character.

416
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:12,506
Scott: Oh god, of course that that's you know.

417
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:19,410
Scott: saying he's the best character is That's like say man, you know, you watch something like full metal alchemist or something.

418
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,565
Scott: There's a bunch of characters and some you like a lot and some not so much.

419
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:23,570
Scott: in bone.

420
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:32,090
Scott: Every character is super awesome Just some slightly more awesome than others and I think that's the biggest strength of bone is that every character is like your favorite.

421
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:33,623
Scott: You can't except for the dragon.

422
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:34,389
Scott: who's the most favorite?

423
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,356
Rym: The dragon pretty much wins out.

424
00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:42,277
Rym: I just the look on his face and that look pretty much Never like it changes so many things.

425
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:43,801
Scott: he says I did.

426
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:46,590
Scott: Ah, but even the bad guys are awesome in this thing.

427
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:51,490
Rym: I think my favorite bad guys, however are these stupid stupid fat rat creatures?

428
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:52,917
Scott: Yeah, those those are also.

429
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,802
Scott: those are right up there.

430
00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:57,177
Scott: But uh rock job John rock job.

431
00:29:57,318 --> 00:29:57,840
Scott: Oh, yeah.

432
00:29:58,121 --> 00:29:59,708
Scott: It's also an amazing job.

433
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:02,377
Rym: Yeah And part of it's just the way they're drawn.

434
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:04,885
Rym: I mean rock jaw rock jaw in particular.

435
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:06,590
Rym: Just he's a cat, right?

436
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:17,683
Rym: He's this giant mountain cat and he's drawn and portrayed so I guess as accurately cat-like as a being like that would be if it existed in the real world.

437
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:22,500
Rym: just in terms of his facial expressions in the Way he reacts to things is just beautiful.

438
00:30:22,741 --> 00:30:22,962
Scott: Yeah.

439
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,030
Scott: No wonder it took this guy so long to make this thing.

440
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,850
Scott: Yeah, if it took him that long, at least he did a good job.

441
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:30,486
Rym: Yeah, talk about characters staying on model.

442
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:36,246
Scott: Good God Yeah, I mean it's one dude making this whole thing and that's not common in you know, u.s.

443
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:37,610
Scott: Comics or anything like that.

444
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,033
Scott: That's you know.

445
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:40,030
Scott: in manga that's more common, but they have assistance.

446
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:42,967
Scott: This guy did the whole thing on his own Tezuka style in.

447
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:53,989
Rym: now The main characters are phone bone and phone civil P bone aka phony bone and they look the same except that Phony bone wears a shirt with a star on it and phone bones pretty much naked

448
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:54,732
Scott: yep,

449
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:59,824
Rym: and uh phone bones a pretty nice guy and phone civil is a complete jackass.

450
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:04,215
Scott: and smiley bone is sort of like the Smiley bones an idiot savant.

451
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:10,317
Scott: Yeah, he's like the comic relief, you know tall kinda, you know funny guy who's like on this.

452
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:13,129
Scott: that's sort of like a Marx Brothers set up in a way.

453
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:16,646
Scott: and Smiley bones sort of like, you know, he hangs with.

454
00:31:16,686 --> 00:31:20,623
Scott: you know Phony bone, you know and sort of does the bad stuff with him.

455
00:31:20,824 --> 00:31:23,317
Rym: and you know, he's totally moral He doesn't care at all.

456
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:25,470
Rym: He does a bad thing good thing whatever just does things.

457
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:30,969
Scott: Yeah, he just you know, he just he's just chillin hanging out doing what people want going along with the show seeing what happens.

458
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:39,877
Rym: Now, of course, I can't forget cuz I love his name and I love every time I see him King Doc King that King Doc is this.

459
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:42,689
Rym: the smiley is dude, but it's not a good kind of smiley.

460
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:48,531
Scott: It's so great how that the way they draw the smiles on King Doc and his henchmen, you know It's.

461
00:31:48,812 --> 00:31:57,345
Scott: it's like a big toothy smile that is simultaneously like happy evil Hungry and scary and dangerous and all at the same time.

462
00:31:57,365 --> 00:31:58,630
Scott: It's it's pretty terrific.

463
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:08,070
Rym: Now the one I guess the only criticism I have about bone and I guess I can get this out right away Is that I read the whole thing in one effective go over the course of about a week.

464
00:32:08,312 --> 00:32:10,069
Scott: I read it in a go in like a couple days.

465
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:27,910
Rym: Well, I only read it on the train and I usually sleep in the morning so I read it on the way home, but The only thing I can say bad about bones that reading it in one go or one go ish at about the two-thirds point It starts to get a little bit cliche and you start to lose like you start to lose the drive.

466
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:31,190
Scott: Yeah, I definitely you know, it is all terrific.

467
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:34,606
Scott: But this it definitely feels to me right.

468
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:46,788
Scott: then when I read it There's a point at which Like the first part of the plot is like coming to a head like the first Climax in the story like big climax, right and there's a huge reveal and I really felt that.

469
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:47,570
Scott: I don't know.

470
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,459
Scott: I'd have to ask Jeff Smith to see if this is true.

471
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:58,134
Scott: But the impression I get I don't know how many times I'm gonna say that is that that first reveal was like planned from the beginning Right, and that was the plan.

472
00:32:58,495 --> 00:33:04,470
Scott: and then after that he sorta didn't have that planned out as well as he had points up.

473
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:11,642
Scott: So it's like part a. we had a super plan written for it and it's executed beautifully And after that the plan is not so perfect.

474
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:13,630
Rym: Well, I know there was at least a secondary plan.

475
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,831
Rym: I've read in multiple places that he drew the last page of bone very early on Uh-huh.

476
00:33:19,092 --> 00:33:25,674
Rym: However, the last page is kind of predictable even from the beginning and it's it's kind of a standard ending that oh, okay That's what happens.

477
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:25,976
Scott: Yeah.

478
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:33,850
Scott: Well, I mean it's an all it's a story for everybody It's all ages so you can't expect like some horrible terrible ending or anything like that.

479
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:45,179
Rym: However, the the big reveal Scott is talking about I mean pretty much my favorite things in order are this reveal the dragon Rokja and then pretty much everything else.

480
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:51,041
Rym: but the big reveal the the epic mo I mean there's basically you kind of wondering where this is going.

481
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:59,572
Rym: and there's a lot of mysteries as to why all these dread the dragon and all these people care about these bones who had nothing to do with this world and what's Going on.

482
00:33:59,612 --> 00:34:03,549
Rym: and why does the hooded one await he who bears the star and?

483
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:09,409
Rym: basically one thing leads to another and There's that that epic reveal happens where?

484
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,710
Rym: Something comes over the horizon and something is revealed in epic glory.

485
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:24,103
Rym: And I remember when I read that page I flipped to that page and it blindsided me and in retrospect I could have seen it in common, but yeah retrospect.

486
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:25,409
Rym: No one sees this coming, right?

487
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,216
Scott: I think that's the best thing.

488
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:28,681
Scott: plot-wise about Bowen is how.

489
00:34:28,702 --> 00:34:29,485
Rym: that's the best thing.

490
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:41,152
Scott: like any comic book ever He puts little bits into the story right that are sort of Off-handed or like he'll have like a like a chapter or a part of a chapter right like a file like a multiple page sequence.

491
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,659
Scott: that's telling a joke because it's you know it's comedic.

492
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:55,860
Scott: early on a lot of I think a lot of the best big adventure Stories start out sort of comedic and happy to let you introduce you to the characters and and grow to like them While just planting a seed of the big plot which is revealed later.

493
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:58,430
Scott: that bone does that as well as anything has ever done.

494
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:03,590
Rym: it Yeah, definitely ramps up these serious and ramps down the humor, but doesn't eliminate the humor.

495
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,818
Scott: No, it doesn't eliminate the humor at all.

496
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:07,693
Scott: there are many other things that do that though But this reveal.

497
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:15,478
Rym: when I saw it I stared at it for about a second and I dropped the stupid book I was laughing out loud so hard it was.

498
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:19,290
Rym: that was that that that alone makes bone worth reading.

499
00:35:19,471 --> 00:35:23,858
Rym: Yeah, oh my even if you don't like bone get to that point You'll know it when it happens.

500
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:25,370
Scott: that is that is the biggest reveal.

501
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:35,529
Scott: But there are many other things in the book where they drop a small hint in like a joke or they bring something up Like in like a page or a panel, but they they make you notice it you won't forget it.

502
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:42,097
Scott: Well, you'll forget it, but when they remind you of it ten chapters later You'll remember that you saw it and it.

503
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:43,483
Scott: I love it.

504
00:35:43,523 --> 00:35:47,597
Scott: when that happens when they give you something You put it in the trunk right.

505
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:51,208
Scott: I mean normally you get the sort of scooby-doo effect the what's it?

506
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:51,850
Scott: What's his name?

507
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:53,573
Rym: Chekhov's gun.

508
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:54,677
Scott: Chekhov's gun, right?

509
00:35:54,998 --> 00:35:57,750
Scott: It's someone is trying to foreshadow something.

510
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:08,970
Scott: It stands out like a sore thumb, you know, it means something later You've got your eye on it And then eventually when it reappears like it's going to you say I saw that coming a mile away.

511
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,813
Scott: It was Chekhov's gun.

512
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:13,870
Scott: It was scooby-doo, you know that that door in the background, you know was drawn.

513
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:17,650
Scott: I'm obviously drawn in the cell and on the background so I knew it was gonna be animated.

514
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:19,623
Scott: So I knew a zombie was gonna come out of it.

515
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:31,590
Scott: You're not fooling anybody Right, but he basically does Chekhov's gun and you forget about the gun Which is so hard to do from a writing and art perspective and he pulls it off multiple times.

516
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:33,035
Scott: Let's do it 100% of the time.

517
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:41,910
Scott: there were eventually and I think that's part of why the sort of towards the end It gets a little bit cliche because he the Chekhov's gunning is not so accurate.

518
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:49,857
Rym: Yeah pretty much a lot of the events that take place at the end kind of come out of nowhere and actually Later on in the story It seems like there's like you.

519
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:53,082
Rym: when an issue ends and the next one begins or a volume ends The next one begins.

520
00:36:53,123 --> 00:37:04,060
Rym: in the book There's often a bit of a disconnect or the the the the action really gets interrupted and things kind of don't always Line up a hundred percent right around the transitions.

521
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,074
Rym: Yep, but seriously that reveal I Cannot express to you.

522
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:21,036
Rym: I people were looking at me at the train because I dropped the book was on the on the ground Gigantic book and I'm just laughing Uncontrollably, it was epic And the whole thing is epic.

523
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:25,130
Scott: I mean, it's you know, there aren't too many epic adventure fantasy stories out there.

524
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:28,514
Scott: This is one of the best ones top 10 probably It's also get.

525
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:32,810
Rym: the end is kind of melancholy as I guess all epic things tend to be.

526
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,428
Rym: I mean look at the end of Lord of the Rings how?

527
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,280
Rym: Melancholy to use the word again it is.

528
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,229
Rym: I mean it's over and just and everyone's Can't quite deal with what's happened to them.

529
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:49,109
Scott: We went on a big adventure and you know everything happened and now it was gonna happen.

530
00:37:49,149 --> 00:37:55,790
Rym: now Now it's over and a lot of moving life and a lot of stories and at like the climax happens.

531
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,990
Rym: And then our and happily ever after and bone does the thing that I loved so much.

532
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,970
Rym: Escaflowne did this the Lord of the Rings did this where you did it?

533
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:19,750
Rym: It's over and then you get what comes after and what comes after is always very Interesting and often kind of sad and kind of not necessarily anti-climactic but like the feeling you have when a journey's over and You have to continue living your life.

534
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,940
Rym: You no longer have this goal in front of you that you've.

535
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:24,170
Rym: this goal has been everything you've cared about It's.

536
00:38:24,191 --> 00:38:27,102
Rym: you know Frodo's got the ring and the ring is all that matters in the world.

537
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:28,347
Rym: and now he's done it.

538
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:28,990
Rym: the Rings gone.

539
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:29,748
Rym: now what?

540
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,844
Scott: Go to the Grey Havens and chill.

541
00:38:33,985 --> 00:38:34,730
Rym: Well, that's one answer.

542
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:39,016
Rym: Sam wise was cool.

543
00:38:39,036 --> 00:38:41,469
Rym: He's like, alright, I'm gonna go back to Hobbiton and be a hobbit.

544
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:46,115
Scott: Yeah, but even then it was kind of like sitting around More an old Hobbiton.

545
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:46,195
Scott: Yep.

546
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,180
Scott: Yep.

547
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:51,815
Rym: Yep There's another interest.

548
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,850
Scott: or like riding the big rollercoaster and riding a little rollercoaster.

549
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,150
Scott: You know, I mean having a family like you did in Hobbiton is a little rollercoaster.

550
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,730
Scott: But you go to Mordor and then you go back and you have to deal with more dog.

551
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,077
Scott: You have to deal with your punk kids.

552
00:39:04,117 --> 00:39:06,630
Scott: you're like whatever my kids I can keep them in line.

553
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:20,102
Scott: Yeah, it's not a you know, no, it's like doing cocaine and then doing less cocaine One that I don't know what that was like one thing One thing that I found really interesting and I I don't really want to.

554
00:39:20,704 --> 00:39:27,227
Rym: I guess it's not much of a spoiler in saying that This does not terribly come up but I was kind of surprised it didn't.

555
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:33,698
Rym: but All throughout the first half of bone and even all the way through the end and they keep this checkoffs gun Keeps being showed you.

556
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:34,969
Rym: they keep showing you this gun.

557
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,730
Rym: But and even after some some things happen, they still show you the gun.

558
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,730
Rym: It's like well the guns are even fired and I don't think there's any more bullets in it.

559
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,755
Rym: Why do they keep showing it to me?

560
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:51,292
Rym: But it is obvious that Bonville is basically the modern world Bonville.

561
00:39:51,432 --> 00:40:06,179
Rym: they keep referencing things in Bonville offhandedly and it's obvious that Bonville is a progressive modern Democratic society that has probably electricity and nuclear power plants and just a normal civilized world.

562
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:28,206
Rym: and they put this fact in your face all the time with little asides even near the end where this one like in the very end like when these climaxes are happening and something comes up with food and this mystic suggests to smileybone that he tried this this stinky cheese and Fonsible makes a remark to the effect of you people with your like unprocessed food.

563
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,210
Rym: What are you trying to kill us?

564
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,887
Rym: Don't people know how to cook around here?

565
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,290
Rym: And all these references and that fucking doesn't really come up at all in all of bone?

566
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:38,757
Rym: No, not really except in one time.

567
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,983
Rym: one time it comes up barely.

568
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:43,169
Rym: Yeah, I guess grind it that one time.

569
00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:47,329
Scott: All right, is there anything else we got to say?

570
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:48,053
Rym: I don't know.

571
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:51,448
Rym: There's a lot of the things I could say would kind of ruin.

572
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:52,151
Rym: bone There's.

573
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:52,874
Scott: I know it's it's.

574
00:40:52,935 --> 00:40:55,004
Scott: I don't want to root cuz it's it's not.

575
00:40:55,024 --> 00:40:55,787
Scott: there's not a lot of.

576
00:40:55,807 --> 00:41:04,287
Scott: I mean There's some messages in bone and some themes and whatnot, but for the most part it's a straight-up in-your-face open book adventure tale.

577
00:41:04,347 --> 00:41:10,675
Scott: so Anything you can say about it other than why it's good or that you should read it or you know What parts.

578
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,450
Scott: what about it is what we like?

579
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:18,470
Scott: We just be giving away the plot which is all that is there even though the plot is an amazing plot.

580
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,255
Scott: That's epic.

581
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,569
Scott: You can't really say anything about about spoiling it.

582
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:22,753
Rym: Oh my god.

583
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,379
Rym: All right, this is Wikipedia.

584
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:29,354
Rym: So uh all grains of salt in place According to Wikipedia.

585
00:41:29,595 --> 00:41:36,148
Rym: I'm just gonna read here in the 1990s an attempt to produce a film of bone through Nickelodeon Films was unsuccessful.

586
00:41:36,757 --> 00:41:37,629
Rym: according to Smith.

587
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:46,969
Rym: Nickelodeon saw the story strictly as children's entertainment and insisted that bone characters be voiced by child actors and that the film had to include pop songs by Britney Spears and in sync.

588
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:55,917
Rym: Smith's argument was that no one would even briefly consider putting pop songs in film adaptations the Lord of the Rings and Therefore they will not be placed in bone either.

589
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,526
Scott: and so it was.

590
00:41:58,546 --> 00:42:07,650
Rym: I can say one thing though I think bone would translate Brilliantly to a film or a series of films or it would have to be something long.

591
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:11,149
Rym: You could do it Lord of the Rings style or you could do it.

592
00:42:11,471 --> 00:42:15,246
Rym: You know, maybe in Japan where they the anime say they just animate a show for 13 or 26 episodes.

593
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:17,461
Rym: We're great in that kind.

594
00:42:17,562 --> 00:42:18,510
Scott: Oh, it would work terrifically.

595
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:29,770
Scott: there's also I think there's some adventure games of bone and I gotta say if you like like the kind of stories you get from Like LucasArts adventure games your bone is the same kind of story is now you will like that action.

596
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:33,584
Scott: There's also a bone adventure game made by someone that you might be able to get.

597
00:42:33,604 --> 00:42:34,668
Scott: it's I don't know.

598
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:39,165
Scott: Oh last year There's a Mac version of it came out.

599
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:39,690
Rym: no great.

600
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:47,014
Scott: so yeah, you can you might be able to get the adventure game if you search around the net and See what else do we got?

601
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:51,870
Rym: but seriously, I think bone would be great as a film partly because there's no sort of inner monologue.

602
00:42:51,950 --> 00:43:01,649
Rym: It's done very cinematically and everything, you know, it's because characters say it or you see it Yep, and you could basically take the comic book and use that to do the storyboards and then just make bone.

603
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:05,790
Rym: That why it kind of bothers me that no one's done something like this because I think it would go.

604
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,019
Rym: Well, yes in the 1990s and it was Nickelodeon.

605
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:23,010
Scott: Yeah, the only other thing I had to say about Jeff Smith the guy who made it he He went to work on Shazam and the Monster Society of Shazam Shazam and the Monster Society of Evil.

606
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:26,647
Scott: So I'm waiting for that to be in a trade paperback and then I'll buy it.

607
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:35,150
Scott: He's starting a new thing right called razzle r a s L and I think the first issue comes out in a month or two.

608
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:45,910
Scott: I pre-ordered it obviously But I'll probably wait a few years for there to be one giant book of the whole thing before I actually you know Buy it, but yeah, he's starting a new comic.

609
00:43:46,412 --> 00:43:54,290
Scott: So if you wanna if you like bone, you should buy Jeff Smith's new comic and the other comics He's made cuz he really hasn't made too many comics.

610
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:59,390
Scott: I mean he worked on bone for how many years, you know, and he didn't work on much else.

611
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,864
Scott: I mean, maybe he did some covers and you know things like that.

612
00:44:01,965 --> 00:44:08,181
Rym: But yeah All right, I think we'll leave it at that because seriously Bone is a hundred percent worth reading.

613
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:10,229
Rym: I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy bone.

614
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:11,874
Scott: I guess it is not a human.

615
00:44:12,075 --> 00:44:15,424
Rym: if you don't like reading then you probably won't like bone.

616
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:17,349
Rym: that that's that's about all I can say.
