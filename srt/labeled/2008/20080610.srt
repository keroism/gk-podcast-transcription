1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,486
Rym: It's Tuesday June 10th.

2
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:12,289
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:14,216
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:19,619
Rym: Tuesday tonight We talk about Super Dodgeball and Super Dodgeball brawlers.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:37,439
Scott: Let's do this So as soon as we start doing the show Twice a week because you know we're sort of running out of things to talk about losing steam.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,572
Scott: No, I think the steam bucket fills up crazy.

7
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:42,440
Rym: that just proves what I'd suspect it all along.

8
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,360
Rym: It's not that we're running out of things to talk about far be it.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,545
Rym: That's not even like.

10
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:47,710
Rym: that's not even on the table.

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,080
Rym: as one of the reasons why we had to slow down the show temporarily.

12
00:00:50,882 --> 00:01:02,391
Rym: I think it's just that we don't have enough time to be awake enough to do the show the way we'd want if we continue to do it four nights a week, but Because we're doing it at this reduced schedule now.

13
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:08,177
Rym: I still have all the stuff I want to say, but I don't have enough shows to say it in.

14
00:01:10,142 --> 00:01:11,717
Scott: It's definitely kind of just.

15
00:01:11,757 --> 00:01:12,040
Scott: you know.

16
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:16,668
Scott: I don't know if it's ironic or not, but we haven't done a show in six days Which I think is the longest.

17
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:28,680
Scott: it's like rain on your wedding day yeah, as long as stretch of no shows and quite a very long time and Suddenly we've got mocha to talk about we've got iphones to talk about we've got shit all over the place.

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,919
Scott: That's happening everywhere in all of geekdom.

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,371
Scott: I think we've only got two shows and none of them.

20
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:36,840
Scott: we really needed a Monday show, but we didn't have one.

21
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:42,499
Rym: I think what it really proves Is that the only thing preventing GeekNights from being four nights a week is the fact that we have day jobs.

22
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,785
Scott: Yes, that could be true.

23
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,390
Rym: GeekNights was somehow my job.

24
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,060
Rym: You can bet that there would be like ten shows a week.

25
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:56,143
Scott: I don't know ten shows, but there will be four GeekNights shows and maybe other shows in addition Shows.

26
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:57,128
Scott: one of them would be right.

27
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,093
Scott: there are ten nights.

28
00:01:58,194 --> 00:01:59,340
Scott: We can't do ten GeekNights.

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,593
Scott: Okay, I mean unless suddenly we add you know the three extra days to the week.

30
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:07,120
Scott: You know Scott day Scott or day and Caturday.

31
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,607
Rym: Caturday's already a day.

32
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,700
Rym: it comes after Friday and before Friday.

33
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:16,789
Rym: Okay Anyway, so I have another quick announcement.

34
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:20,760
Rym: We'll have a lot more about this in the upcoming weeks, and I don't know months.

35
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:30,320
Rym: It's not like it's exactly on the near horizon But we've said before and we're saying again GeekNights is going to the penny arcade expo in Seattle this summer.

36
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,850
Scott: We're going no matter what we will be there Maybe just cuz.

37
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:42,280
Rym: I've been dealing with emails and stuff a lot lately But I almost said penny arcade is coming to GeekNights, then I realized that that is not in any way true.

38
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:44,428
Rym: I wish that was true But no we're good.

39
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:52,800
Rym: not only we're going to be at PAX And I'm going to talk a lot more about this once we confirm a few of the special details that are not quite public yet.

40
00:02:53,322 --> 00:03:01,313
Rym: But we're not just going to PAX as Rym and Scott We're going to fax as Rym and Scott VIPs because we're totally running a panel.

41
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,035
Scott: awesome.

42
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:03,860
Scott: one panel gets you VIP status.

43
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:04,578
Scott: That's pretty cool.

44
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:15,558
Rym: You know I got to say penny arcade the most professional professional conventions in terms of dealing with us as like guests or as Staff or as talent or panelists or anything like that?

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,919
Rym: Otakons way up there like they're really good at that and Katsucon is does a pretty good job.

46
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:32,180
Rym: But the penny arcade expo has farmed away with the possible exception of the for-profit New York comic-con New York anime festival been the most professional in terms of their dealings with us.

47
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:41,516
Rym: From what I'm feeling is that I think they're twice as professional as the New York and in festival comic-con now because there was It's a different kind date the New York comic-con anime fest and all that are like.

48
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,385
Rym: we are Professional in the.

49
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:46,600
Rym: we are making money off of this way and everything has to be perfect.

50
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,088
Scott: But I mean you said they replied to the email like ten minutes.

51
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:49,710
Rym: Well.

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,192
Rym: That's not.

53
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:52,640
Rym: that's not necessarily a sign of professional.

54
00:03:52,941 --> 00:04:03,860
Rym: Yes, no because I can tell you this and like at IBM if you responded to an email right away And you did this all the time It was pretty much assumed that you weren't doing your real work, and we're just kind of dicking around in your office.

55
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,255
Scott: This was usually true, but what if your job is email?

56
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:08,400
Rym: No one's job is email.

57
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:16,365
Rym: I get is if you're like you know Mention I'll tell you a little bit about IVM's corporate culture And it's I can't.

58
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:20,819
Rym: this is not a an indictment of IBM because most large tech companies are like this.

59
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,833
Rym: I Gained an average of 10 to 40 unread emails a day.

60
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,560
Rym: now that doesn't mean I got 40 emails a day.

61
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:29,594
Rym: That means all of the emails I got every day.

62
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:33,758
Rym: 10 to 40 of them I did not read and that meant that they never got read.

63
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,786
Scott: Wow, yeah, but I'm saying is that if you're say the panels person for a convention that only happens You know like one weekend out of the year.

64
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:48,690
Scott: your primary work is mostly reading and writing emails And then you know other than that.

65
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,280
Scott: It's like figuring things out on paper.

66
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:59,680
Rym: I can say this this is the second time that a panel person has Responded to me with the phrase we would be honored.

67
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:10,000
Rym: I am very happy about this, but now the panel We are running will involve Dungeons and Dragons in some way and other tabletop role-playing systems.

68
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,771
Rym: but I'm going to be sparse on the details until we Finalize more of them.

69
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:15,518
Rym: I'll leave it at that.

70
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:20,520
Rym: We're going to be at penny arcade Expo in a big way, and I highly recommend you all be there.

71
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:32,000
Scott: Yeah, and since you won't have any tables or anything like that We're pretty much gonna run this panel and the rest of the time The packs is pretty much the only con in a live for a long time.

72
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,240
Rym: We're not only will be able to see us do something But you'll have a chance of hanging out with us or talking to us for more than 30 seconds.

73
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:39,726
Scott: Oh, and it's Labor Day weekend.

74
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:40,409
Rym: Yes.

75
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,060
Scott: Oh, and it will probably gonna fly out like Wednesday night.

76
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,560
Scott: So if anyone like Thursday wants to chill in Seattle, that's that's what we're gonna be doing.

77
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:55,491
Rym: Yes, and to all the people who try to see us at all these anime cons like Katsucon and ConnectiCon It won't be like that where you're like see us running by and you yell.

78
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:57,277
Rym: Hey, we'll actually have time to chill.

79
00:05:57,297 --> 00:06:01,340
Scott: Yep I don't know what else to say about it right now, except I'm excited.

80
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:02,284
Rym: I've what I.

81
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:06,080
Scott: except for now all the West Coast people can shut up cuz like hey we come to the West Coast.

82
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,215
Scott: You can't say all the East Coast is too far.

83
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:16,880
Rym: I can't come over Meanwhile to certain people who do a webcomic copped out of coming to Otakon and then don't really come to the East Coast.

84
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,327
Rym: Yeah, so we're bringing it to.

85
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:20,740
Scott: you went to the Baltimore comic-con a couple times.

86
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,129
Rym: Whatever Baltimore comic-con would just be depressing.

87
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,700
Rym: as much as I like comics just one room out of the whole.

88
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:31,720
Rym: Being at the Baltimore Convention Center and not having the entire convention center would be frightening.

89
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:34,082
Scott: It would quite be quite eerie I believe.

90
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:34,906
Rym: not just that.

91
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:37,717
Rym: the fact that you at Otakon and it's not just like it'd be sort of like.

92
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:43,951
Scott: I imagine it's be Sort of like, you know Thursday reg at Otakon where it's sort of like activity in one area but the rest of the thing is like.

93
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,760
Rym: But even Thursday reg at Otakon has like 10,000 people standing outside making a ruckus.

94
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,796
Scott: Yeah, well, they're outside but you know, it's like they're feeling in the convention center would be similar.

95
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:54,720
Rym: see to me.

96
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,691
Rym: I think being it at any convention at the BCC like that That's so small would be like when I was a kid.

97
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,680
Scott: first of all, it's not worth the trip to Baltimore.

98
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,446
Rym: Baltimore is not that far.

99
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:06,940
Scott: It's still too far for a tiny convention.

100
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:08,467
Rym: It's not really not much further.

101
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:11,120
Rym: that actually is about the same distance all told is getting a Rochester.

102
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,994
Scott: Hey Rochester is not worth it for a tiny convention either.

103
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:16,426
Rym: No Toricon but that's that's.

104
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,499
Rym: that's a very near and dear to our heart convention.

105
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,379
Rym: Once I've been to almost all of them.

106
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:28,060
Rym: Yeah I Founded the thing that eventually was gotten rid of and replaced by the thing that became Toricon.

107
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,646
Rym: Yeah, I can say that much.

108
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:37,054
Rym: but I think being it like the BCC on one of those small comms would be like when I Was a kid and I was at Cedar Point and I'd be in the fantasy land of.

109
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:58,700
Rym: I am in roller coaster heaven but then I'd be at the top of the roller coaster and there's that kind of Moment of pause between when the click click click click click stops before you go over the edge When I'd look to my left and I'd see over Lake Erie all the normal people in the normal buildings working And the real world would like intrude into my happiness for that brief second.

110
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:06,972
Rym: It's like it's like seeing the janitor when you're at an amusement park But the janitor is usually like in a costume or something depends on the amusement park.

111
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:13,104
Rym: I guess Wildwood's janitors are usually well anyway We'll leave it at.

112
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:16,200
Rym: that is we're in Canada suits, so I'm gonna get right into this.

113
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,019
Rym: This is not my news, but I have to say something about this.

114
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:28,139
Rym: We can now look at the cover for Soul Caliber 4 And I think Kotaku said it better than I ever could have said.

115
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:29,545
Rym: rest in peace.

116
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:34,544
Rym: Soul Caliber 1998 to 2008 wrong They actually the reason.

117
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:39,299
Scott: now you I'm saying wrong which means you think I might disagree that Soul Caliber is dead.

118
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,159
Rym: No, you're saying that it died long before.

119
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:45,048
Rym: You are wise.

120
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:46,616
Rym: I guess he got shy vote, I don't know.

121
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:52,996
Scott: Soul Caliber 3 I mean some people say it's okay But I highly doubt that Soul Caliber 3 is anything like Soul Caliber 2.

122
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:56,689
Rym: so as far as I'm concerned Soul Caliber 3 was not a bad game.

123
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,595
Rym: It was just not better than 2.

124
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:00,883
Rym: Yes, so I know people out there right now.

125
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:01,626
Scott: We're going over image Scott.

126
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:02,770
Scott: You don't know anything.

127
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,540
Rym: You know what the majority people out there are going huh?

128
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:11,618
Rym: Yeah, and if you need any proof of that go to any convention right?

129
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,544
Rym: Katsucon was a good example.

130
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:18,721
Rym: You'll see a lot more people playing Soul Caliber 2 than Soul Caliber 3.

131
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,727
Scott: Yeah, plus Soul Caliber 3 didn't wasn't on.

132
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,680
Scott: you know every system like 2 was which really actually hurt it in a ways.

133
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:34,346
Scott: Yeah But Soul Caliber Soul edge the business Soul Caliber the business Soul Caliber on the Dreamcast the business Soul Caliber 2 Double business.

134
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:35,048
Rym: one of them.

135
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,060
Rym: I'm not going to say is the best the best 3d fighting game ever.

136
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:40,370
Rym: I don't know if I'd say that because it's what's better.

137
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,275
Scott: I don't know.

138
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:44,166
Scott: 3d fighting games See actually a three.

139
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:47,799
Scott: it can't be one of those 3d fighting games like virtual fighter one that wasn't actually 3d.

140
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,824
Scott: It just looked 3d.

141
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:50,413
Rym: What about Bushido blade 3?

142
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:54,526
Scott: Bushido blades not good And it's definitely not as good as Soul Caliber 2.

143
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,472
Rym: Well one fuck you and two.

144
00:09:57,214 --> 00:10:04,469
Rym: but now the cover of Soul Caliber 4. alright It's got Darth Vader on it.

145
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:05,352
Rym: Yeah, like it's.

146
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,520
Rym: it is actually Darth Vader.

147
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:09,133
Scott: Usually this is the kind of it's.

148
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:10,080
Scott: it's weird, right?

149
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,133
Scott: It's like when someone throws a character like that in there.

150
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:17,900
Rym: if I was 14, no No, if I was 13, this would be the best like alright.

151
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,604
Rym: So think about it.

152
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:19,951
Scott: when they put link in there.

153
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:28,320
Scott: Everyone was like hell's yeah And that sort of encouraged them to do that again, and they they basically went for they went straight for the throat.

154
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:34,800
Rym: Know what they did in the in the immortal words of Rama Sharma.

155
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:37,387
Rym: They they tried to do too much with it.

156
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:38,731
Scott: they shared it.

157
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,780
Scott: they basically we said well putting link in there worked.

158
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:46,075
Scott: Let's just go for the biggest what guns we can now Darth Vader.

159
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,560
Scott: You can't get much bigger guns than that.

160
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:48,504
Rym: It's been a while.

161
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,331
Rym: So I should probably explain the Rama Sharma.

162
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:51,536
Rym: You tried to do too much with it.

163
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:56,076
Rym: very briefly So at IBM, there's this awesome dude named Rama Sharma and I worked with him.

164
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:56,760
Rym: He was awesome.

165
00:10:57,081 --> 00:11:02,140
Rym: He was Indian and he played tennis and he was all cool and I usually went to lunch with him in the eunuch Santa.

166
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:16,577
Rym: but Whenever we play tennis or actually whatever anything was happening anytime someone obviously put did something that reeked of effort or Tried to do more than they probably should have tried to do.

167
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,338
Rym: like, you know We're in a tennis match and I could have just hit it.

168
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:26,439
Rym: I could have just hit it over the net but no I tried to slam it over the net and instead I slammed it into The net and lost the game.

169
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:32,583
Rym: He would look at me and he put his finger out and he'd waggle it in my face and he'd say you know Your problem is.

170
00:11:32,603 --> 00:11:34,732
Rym: you see you you tried.

171
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,440
Rym: you tried to do too much with it.

172
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,971
Rym: If you had you done less you might have made it.

173
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:41,671
Rym: but no you tried to do too much and I got the point And you lose.

174
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:50,840
Scott: yep If you try to do a fancy move But it that causes you to fail in a situation where you could have pulled off the simple move that would have guaranteed non-failure.

175
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:52,808
Scott: That is when you tried to do too much with it.

176
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,695
Rym: So Darth Vader too much.

177
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,502
Scott: That's too much basically I see.

178
00:11:56,522 --> 00:12:08,580
Scott: the thing is why didn't they realize right that in this whole caliber too when they threw in the extra characters That only people only like the link people hated the spawn and the whatever his face was right?

179
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:09,744
Rym: And I was.

180
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:10,526
Rym: why didn't they?

181
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:19,900
Rym: was that more a product of the fact that link is so independently popular Coupled with the fact that it was like the first fighting game on the Gamecube?

182
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:22,126
Scott: I think that might have had.

183
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:27,880
Scott: there were there many factors the reasons why link was accepted and people were overjoyed at that inclusion.

184
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:35,100
Scott: However, why didn't they just like, you know put out like a little focus group about this Darth Vader Yoda thing before they did it?

185
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:37,100
Rym: It's it's one of those things where link is like.

186
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:41,568
Rym: All right I kind of understand and it did work But it just even.

187
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:46,469
Rym: when I heard that Darth Vader and Yoda were gonna be in Soul Calibur I didn't think it was a joke.

188
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,400
Rym: I assumed it was a joke.

189
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:56,067
Rym: I was absolutely sure that it was fake and then when it was until it was actually officially announced I did not even consider it.

190
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:58,036
Scott: Well, that was that we talked about that for quite a while.

191
00:12:58,076 --> 00:12:58,940
Scott: Yeah, not your news.

192
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:04,075
Rym: So anyway, the cover to Soul Calibur 4 is epically fail.

193
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:07,743
Scott: It is quite the epic fail All right.

194
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:09,912
Rym: Also the lightsaber should be cutting through that sword.

195
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:10,353
Rym: Good God.

196
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:18,039
Scott: Anyway, so anyway If we did a Monday show yesterday, you probably would have talked about iPhones and such for a long time.

197
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:19,626
Rym: I'm probably gonna buy one.

198
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:24,650
Scott: I'm probably going to also but more on that on a Monday My blackberry and I'm gonna get rid of it.

199
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,357
Rym: I've had it for one like six months.

200
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:26,920
Scott: That's all right.

201
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,588
Scott: You didn't pay for it.

202
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:34,758
Scott: now regardless I can talk about iPhones today because they announced many games for the new iPhones.

203
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:36,601
Scott: you see and Let's see.

204
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:37,645
Scott: They got the monkey ball.

205
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:40,475
Scott: They got this other game called Pangeas some other.

206
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:41,940
Scott: the company is Pangea software.

207
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,999
Scott: They have a game called enigma and there's a game called chromag rally, right?

208
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,187
Scott: And basically what's going on here?

209
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:50,560
Rym: It chromags like the thing that ruined sliders.

210
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:51,525
Scott: I don't know.

211
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:53,396
Rym: Is that a sliders game?

212
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:54,060
Scott: I don't know.

213
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,689
Scott: I think it's a racing game of like cavemen.

214
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:58,692
Scott: You're like chromagnon.

215
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,138
Scott: Ah, no, I'm not sure.

216
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:01,920
Scott: I didn't look at it.

217
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,516
Scott: All I see is the name here, right?

218
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:22,080
Scott: but basically the iPhone is looking to be sort of a gaming platform right and How I think this is gonna go right is first of all, this is not competing with DS's and PSP's Even though the graphics look better than DS but a little less than PSP, right?

219
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,169
Scott: This is not going competing in those marketplaces.

220
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:33,460
Scott: What this is competing with right is not so much Games on other cell phones because people buy games for whatever cell phone they have right?

221
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,277
Scott: It's competing for the developers of cell phone games.

222
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:45,189
Scott: you see The people whose job it is to make cell phone games Right are going to choose to.

223
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:52,860
Scott: instead of making a Java cell phone game They are going to choose instead to make an iPhone cell phone game or both.

224
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,744
Rym: I choose you.

225
00:14:53,764 --> 00:15:09,934
Scott: All right, but the iPhone has features such as touchscreen and accelerometers where people are going to make iPhone cell phone games that are not going to work in any other phone and Thus all these developers of cell phone games spend their time making iPhone games.

226
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,700
Scott: other cell phones won't have so many games.

227
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:18,940
Rym: The iPhone will look pretty hot compared to those other cell phones Never mind the fact that I was sold that I could have the Cisco VPN and an SSH client.

228
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:28,660
Scott: Yeah now here is here's one thing about the the iPhone games that sort of make me a little iffy here and I'm probably not gonna buy Any iPhone games even if some of them are pretty good, huh?

229
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:38,302
Scott: Basically a lot of these games are using the accelerometers and the iPhones that you can sort of tilt it Right, and you might think that makes sense, especially for monkey ball the first game They showed.

230
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:43,900
Rym: my one concern is much like trying to play certain games on the DS in public places.

231
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:46,893
Rym: You either feel stupid or end up waggling around like an idiot.

232
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,520
Scott: No, that's that's not my concern.

233
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:55,996
Scott: No, my concern is that notice how the DS uses the touchscreen only whereas the Wii has the waggling All right.

234
00:15:56,722 --> 00:16:05,539
Scott: If you put the waggling in the DS this problem happens and that while you waggle You're actually waggling the screen at the same time.

235
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:16,382
Scott: That's going to make for a very bad game If I have to tilt the screen forward to move the monkey ball forward and now I can't see the screen Problem.

236
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:16,983
Rym: Hello.

237
00:16:17,003 --> 00:16:19,609
Rym: Yeah, same time you could you could.

238
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:32,540
Rym: I feel like that sort of control could be used subtly to great effect But if overused well Too much require a great deal of calibration to make sure that you don't have to move the screen very far.

239
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,320
Scott: But then you have these very tight controls that might be too tight, you know, it's it's gonna be really tricky there.

240
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,028
Scott: But I guess touchscreen games could be fun.

241
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:42,660
Scott: little touchscreen Tetris could be okay if you're bored or whatever.

242
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,799
Scott: But really if I'm looking for gaming, I'll just whip up my DS.

243
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:51,226
Scott: You know the iPhone won't have the sort of local wireless multiplayer The DS has.

244
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:53,619
Scott: it won't have the two screens the DS has.

245
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:55,646
Rym: yes Remember that the touchscreen is not.

246
00:16:55,707 --> 00:17:03,420
Scott: what made the DS the amazing at least not to people have the tactile You know arrows and buttons the DS has which are essential for many many games.

247
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:04,827
Rym: Yes But the thing is you don't.

248
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:14,041
Rym: could be really really good on The iPhone would be adventure games like a little Phoenix right would be okay and real-time or turn-based strategy games That'd be okay.

249
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:24,900
Rym: because this that sort of interface games where it's not there's there's different game control and the idioms like Mario games and platformers that sort of thing won't work at all because you really do need those buttons.

250
00:17:25,362 --> 00:17:30,566
Rym: But idioms like I have menus and I'm clicking on things work real Well, which is yeah all good.

251
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:36,168
Rym: for Rym who thought Gemfire was one of the best games ever a Phoenix Right would work and say an Advance Wars might work.

252
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,472
Scott: The thing is right.

253
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:42,364
Scott: even with an Advance Wars the single-player be okay Multiplayer no go.

254
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:56,294
Scott: unless they set up some sort of Bluetooth gaming which is I don't think it's gonna be fast enough Some sort of ad-hoc Wi-Fi I don't know, but the DS Completely a win for at least for me personally was the local wireless.

255
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:58,120
Rym: Everything else is just a okay, whatever.

256
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,320
Scott: But the local wireless revolutionized gaming for me and it could theoretically do a local wireless because does have Wi-Fi in it.

257
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,226
Scott: Yes, and you know, what is that?

258
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,220
Scott: gonna disconnect you from the Internet's, you know?

259
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,440
Scott: And then maybe they could do internet Wi-Fi, which actually be pretty cool.

260
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:19,980
Scott: I doubt they're gonna let you play games live over the 3g even if it's possible You know because they don't want you using up all that crazy bandwidth or whatever because they're assholes.

261
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:24,703
Scott: But yeah, iPhone gaming might be something I really do.

262
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:28,939
Scott: I think I think the iPhone should really would be a hit in terms of gaming.

263
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:32,200
Scott: is If someone who made like MMOs, right?

264
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:39,708
Scott: Let's say Blizzard made like not a full-on World of Warcraft client for the iPhone But sort of like a mini World of Warcraft client.

265
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:43,040
Scott: We're like you could do a few World of Warcraft things on your iPhone.

266
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:45,689
Scott: So like the crazy addicts that would make mad moneys.

267
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:50,384
Scott: not that I want that but you know that make bad moneys Right.

268
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,479
Rym: So I actually have some news.

269
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,259
Rym: Luckily, we don't need to talk about it for a long time.

270
00:18:55,561 --> 00:19:00,879
Rym: I think you all know my opinions on this and also coming around to this Scott side of things there, huh?

271
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,374
Scott: Don't just keep going.

272
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:08,600
Rym: no No, cuz the thing is I don't think that this hurts the thing that is being applied to in any way.

273
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:12,973
Scott: Well, it hurts it in one sense and it helps it in another side.

274
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:20,292
Rym: now the thing that the reason I don't want to talk about it a lot is because while This is totally a rumor and I have not is it.

275
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:21,135
Scott: I thought it was real.

276
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:22,320
Rym: Where did you see that?

277
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:22,982
Scott: I don't know.

278
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:24,749
Scott: I just sort of saw words on the Internet's.

279
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,151
Scott: Yes.

280
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:27,280
Rym: I've seen words about this all over the place.

281
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:39,540
Rym: However, I did not look too deeply into finding out if it is true or not because the original thing I read way back was based mostly on a couple of screenshots and some other speculation.

282
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,564
Scott: Okay, all right.

283
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:42,667
Scott: So so this is now real.

284
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:51,880
Rym: and well this mayor this may have been verified since I looked but Going two nights a week does not mean I'm gonna put any more due diligence into my news than I have before.

285
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,523
Scott: There you go.

286
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:55,999
Scott: However spirit I'm gonna talk about don't try to do too much of it.

287
00:19:57,388 --> 00:19:57,819
Rym: You know what?

288
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:06,470
Rym: I think you're trying to use the try to do too much with it too much and thus are trying to do too much with Perhaps perhaps Indeed so quite quiet.

289
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,097
Scott: You're trying to do too much with these.

290
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:12,791
Rym: sure Supposing World of Warcraft were to get achievements.

291
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:15,160
Scott: This is the whole game just achievements already.

292
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:19,880
Rym: So this enters this delicious world of meta that I. it's so wonderful.

293
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:24,413
Rym: It's so meta that there would be achievements in an achievement based game.

294
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,780
Scott: I mean pretty much the game is achievements.

295
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,325
Scott: It's like kill the guy.

296
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:31,053
Scott: get this item kill that guy get this.

297
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,845
Rym: no, no, no, that's not a while works at all Uh-huh.

298
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,957
Rym: You obviously have never played.

299
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:38,559
Rym: Wow Get a bunch of people together kill all these guys.

300
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,187
Rym: What if you will get an item?

301
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,979
Rym: do the exact same thing until everyone gets the item?

302
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,695
Scott: That's even worse.

303
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,875
Rym: But supposing that were you to get to level 15 without dying you would get 50 something points.

304
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:53,199
Rym: or were you to?

305
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:59,120
Rym: Complete 10 quests in the howling fjord you would get 50 something points.

306
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:02,430
Scott: But isn't the game already give you something if you complete a quest?

307
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:06,157
Rym: Yes, it gives you something but it doesn't give you something points.

308
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:08,899
Scott: See, that's the thing with all these games.

309
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:12,451
Scott: Really on the fundamental levels that they're not games of winning and losing.

310
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:16,986
Scott: they are games of do stuff and gets and get Meaningless rewards no matter what you do.

311
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:17,769
Rym: Here's the thing.

312
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,120
Rym: It's it's no different than SimCity in that regard.

313
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:23,286
Rym: Now it's don't.

314
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:24,553
Scott: you can lose it SimCity.

315
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:25,599
Rym: no you can't.

316
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,387
Scott: yeah You can be no matter how bad.

317
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:28,130
Scott: you could run out of money.

318
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:34,660
Rym: No because no matter how badly you're going No, you can just bulldoze everything down to like a couple of little zones.

319
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,770
Rym: You're one little power plant and then leave the game on for like a week or two And then you'll get enough money back to start playing again.

320
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,380
Scott: Yeah, but the year will advance so far into the cares.

321
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:46,509
Rym: That doesn't do anything.

322
00:21:47,012 --> 00:21:48,039
Rym: You're doesn't mean Jack.

323
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:57,084
Scott: The thing is if SimCity wasn't a broken game It's it's theoretically at least a game of design and you have to come up with a better design That works.

324
00:21:57,144 --> 00:21:58,389
Rym: the problem is it's a game of.

325
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:00,396
Rym: there is a perfect design simply implemented.

326
00:22:00,457 --> 00:22:01,300
Scott: That is a problem.

327
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,252
Scott: Yes, if it was much more complicated and difficult to come up with a good wasn't?

328
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:08,203
Rym: then it would just be a sandbox with multiple paths.

329
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:12,865
Scott: at least the sandbox is better than a you know a Manual labor for meaningless.

330
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:17,780
Rym: I don't share your vitriol when it comes to World of Warcraft because I don't see you playing it.

331
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:18,422
Scott: Well, there's

332
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:35,360
Rym: the thing if you remove the grind from it and you just look at playing the game Like let's say I could just if I if I was subscribed to Wow I could anytime arbitrarily pick a level pick a class pick a race Pick all my equipment and then do whatever raids I want to do with all my friends who have picked similar levels.

333
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:39,860
Rym: Then the game would probably be pretty damn fun and I could see playing it with my friends.

334
00:22:40,302 --> 00:22:42,273
Scott: I don't think so because then what would be?

335
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:43,460
Scott: you're doing this thing, right?

336
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:45,928
Scott: You just picked the best equipment.

337
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:46,551
Scott: there is you.

338
00:22:46,611 --> 00:22:50,043
Scott: it's basically no different than the World of Warcraft card game Which is you?

339
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:54,580
Scott: you know, if you have enough money, you can pick whatever cards you want and it's just a matter.

340
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,390
Scott: It's basically rock-paper-scissors, but you see the scissors.

341
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,297
Scott: I just decide to throw rock.

342
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:00,902
Rym: Not really How?

343
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:06,620
Rym: not really because in this case, it's kind of like playing Team Fortress where alright, we're all gonna do this thing.

344
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,838
Rym: I mean basically once I'd done every raid a couple of times I would have no reason to play again.

345
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:13,430
Rym: But at least I wouldn't have to level up to get to that point.

346
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,980
Rym: because then it's alright, let's go on this mission.

347
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,840
Rym: It's a lot like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles get all your friends together and you go on this kind of mission together.

348
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:23,094
Rym: When you're done, you're done and hey, we beat it now.

349
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:24,000
Rym: Let's do the next one.

350
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,370
Rym: let's all meet on Saturday and do some other one.

351
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:42,900
Rym: if you remove all the doing something more than once in order to get items or Doing something more than once in order to get levels or basically any sort of non arbitrary advancement I would be all about Wow until I'd done every raid a couple time.

352
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:53,390
Scott: Now the thing about the diff the thing that found all these Crystal Chronicles is a good example because it's basically Wow Except there is one key difference that separates it from Wow Which is why the newer Crystal Chronicles is the suck.

353
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:55,459
Scott: is that it actually the whole?

354
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:03,807
Scott: mechanic of having the secret information based on which player you are and one person has the map and someone else is The only thing that made that.

355
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:06,056
Scott: that was the only thing that made that game worthwhile.

356
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:07,020
Rym: I don't think so at all.

357
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,780
Scott: No, that is the only reason that that game was not terrible.

358
00:24:12,522 --> 00:24:24,980
Scott: I the fact that it forced you to have the set up this sort of interaction between the people and in this Cooperation whereas and Wow, it's pretty much you just learn the exact job You're supposed to do and then you just do the job repeatedly.

359
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:33,654
Rym: But you can do the exact same thing in Crystal Chronicles because those maps and all that in secret information Was in the end useless and all it did was make the game faster.

360
00:24:33,694 --> 00:24:34,799
Rym: It didn't actually help you ever.

361
00:24:35,562 --> 00:24:37,327
Scott: Yeah, it did cuz it didn't it did.

362
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,823
Rym: all you had to do was always turn left and you would always solve every puzzle and Get to the end.

363
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:45,140
Rym: all the maps did was give you guys people an excuse to talk to each other.

364
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:46,080
Rym: What made that game?

365
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,415
Rym: Great was the fact that you get four friends together and you would be in this shit together.

366
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:53,100
Rym: and also it ended.

367
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:57,360
Rym: No, well ending is important too, but it had a good theme and had good style.

368
00:24:57,642 --> 00:25:00,480
Rym: And it was you take four people and you play together.

369
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:15,900
Rym: I also feel that Crystal Chronicles was only worth playing if you played through it in like one or two goes like a group of people one group of people all the way through and also if you ignored pretty much all the Advancements of the game other than the advancement that occurs naturally in the course of playing.

370
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:22,540
Rym: I feel as though World of Warcraft would be as fun as Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

371
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:31,259
Rym: If I did not have to ever Level and no one else ever had to level and you could never get anything that affected the game in the game.

372
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,680
Scott: That would make it a little bit better, but it still would not make it good.

373
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,322
Scott: Why not?

374
00:25:36,623 --> 00:25:38,027
Scott: because there's still you're not doing it.

375
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:39,833
Scott: All you're doing is manual labor.

376
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:42,200
Rym: You realize the only manual labor is the grind.

377
00:25:43,603 --> 00:25:45,840
Scott: So be what so but do it's no different.

378
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,671
Scott: So the only difference is I'm doing the same exact labor only now.

379
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:50,457
Scott: numbers don't go up because I control the numb.

380
00:25:50,478 --> 00:25:56,350
Rym: doing any one Raid or any one part of the game once would be fun No less fun than doing any one level in Crystal Chronicles.

381
00:25:56,952 --> 00:25:59,540
Scott: doing the same with the levels in Crystal Chronicles is annoying.

382
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:04,540
Scott: The fun part was trying to figure out where to go and then, you know, try to figure out.

383
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:11,198
Scott: Okay, you take this, you know competing for all those the items at the end like oh Are you gonna take that one and you know sort of bickering with each other?

384
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,021
Scott: I don't know.

385
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:13,989
Scott: actual game itself didn't offer anything.

386
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,615
Rym: I kind of disagree again.

387
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:16,097
Rym: It was okay.

388
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:27,860
Rym: I don't understand why you hate like why you get so freaked out about World of Warcraft every time it comes up and you get So angry about it and just vitriol left and right because I don't I don't like I had this.

389
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,160
Scott: It's just World of Warcraft happens to be the most popular big phenomena.

390
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,008
Scott: So that's why it gets most of the vitriol.

391
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:35,293
Scott: I feel the same way about all.

392
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:44,100
Rym: every game that has the same Characteristics and yet you want to play other get like some board games we have that are just worse in many regards gameplay wise.

393
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:48,073
Rym: But anyway, I feel as though wow wouldn't be that bad.

394
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:51,948
Rym: and my question to wild players I'll end it on this at least to all of you out there.

395
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:55,000
Rym: Look, I honestly answer this question for me.

396
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,487
Rym: I'm really really curious.

397
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,778
Rym: I'll put up a poll or something on the forum about this.

398
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:01,910
Rym: if World of Warcraft were changed.

399
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:08,460
Rym: It was the exact same game Except that every single player could arbitrarily choose their level and equipment at any time.

400
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,259
Rym: Well at any time outside of a raid once you start a raid you stuck with what you got.

401
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:16,320
Rym: But you could just arbitrarily choose level and arbitrarily choose equipment.

402
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:20,780
Rym: Would you continue to play World of Warcraft and do you think you would make it a better or worse game?

403
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,500
Rym: I imagine that question will tell me a lot about who what kind of person you are.

404
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:34,400
Scott: I imagine that most people would do that go around and sort of see everything there was in the game and then stop playing.

405
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:38,140
Rym: But yes, you know what because then the game would be almost exactly like Crystal Chronicles.

406
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:45,480
Scott: Yes Well, the other thing right is that I've noticed there are some people in the world right like look at counter-strike, right?

407
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:54,524
Scott: There are some people who play counter-strike and they don't cheat and they actually want like a good game right and like like if I cheated a counter-strike like I mean Oh, I had.

408
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:59,795
Scott: I was I had a computer once that you know It was at like a LAN party or whatever and it was all full of counter-strike cheats.

409
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:07,919
Scott: and you know You played a few times with all the cheats and you just shoot everyone in the head and you win and you win and you Win and whatever and it got boring really quick.

410
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:27,180
Scott: But there are other people where with the cheats like they're having fun forever with those cheats like it's never unfun for them, right and I imagine the kind of person who Enjoys, you know the cheating game continuously You know is the one kind of person and the person who can't deal with the cheating game is the other kind of person.

411
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:28,819
Rym: See, I don't know how relevant it is.

412
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Rym: I mean sure there would be some people but I guess the other extension you could have is every raid would have a level cap.

413
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:35,696
Rym: so it's not so.

414
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:43,640
Rym: then the Pre-game meta grind crap no longer exists because no longer do you have to do repetitive tasks?

415
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,940
Scott: But how is that any different from the World of Warcraft card game, which we were bashing because that's not a multiplayer game?

416
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,542
Rym: That's not.

417
00:28:49,622 --> 00:28:51,128
Scott: it is when you do those raid thingies.

418
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,400
Scott: It's a bunch of people together versus the one guy who has the raid deck.

419
00:28:55,062 --> 00:29:02,837
Rym: Well, if you do that specific aspect of the game, which we didn't play and can't talk a lot about Yeah, but we pretty much confirm that the way the game works is a matter of you.

420
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:04,460
Scott: once you know What's in the raid deck?

421
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:12,072
Scott: It's just a matter of Constructing your deck to beat it as in a rock-paper-scissors where you know The other guy has rock and you win.

422
00:29:12,092 --> 00:29:13,540
Rym: that could probably be really fun.

423
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:16,380
Scott: So if I know the raid is full of fire, I choose all the water.

424
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:26,194
Rym: It would be just as fun as playing the hero quest like games or beat the game games for alright Here's the game you play request is terrible.

425
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,400
Rym: Well, actually it's kind of funny.

426
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,593
Rym: You just got to add a lot of style to it and just get into it.

427
00:29:29,754 --> 00:29:30,820
Scott: No, it's terrible.

428
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:31,367
Scott: What's they are?

429
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:32,440
Scott: you want to play hero quest now?

430
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,977
Rym: The only problem was when we decided to iterate through it perfectly.

431
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:37,519
Rym: and I'm not.

432
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:41,660
Rym: I mean Wow is a lot better than hero quest in that regard even the card games a lot better than hero.

433
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,033
Scott: Well, because only because it's more complex so it but it fundamentally is no different.

434
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:48,159
Rym: but you're I just don't get your.

435
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:56,383
Rym: oh well fundamentally because all games fundamentally are either completely arbitrary or completely stalemate or Completely solved.

436
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:57,387
Rym: Yeah, why?

437
00:29:57,628 --> 00:30:00,780
Rym: if you argue with that level then there's no point in even talking about games anymore?

438
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,428
Scott: Yeah, there are because there are games that are not solved.

439
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:05,814
Rym: So then play those games.

440
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:10,019
Rym: I do not really you don't play go You don't really play chess because goes not fun.

441
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:12,564
Rym: No, it isn't.

442
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:13,146
Scott: it's mostly.

443
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,530
Scott: so no it isn't solved enough.

444
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,253
Scott: No, it's not.

445
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:16,637
Scott: There are only so many possible.

446
00:30:16,678 --> 00:30:17,420
Scott: board configuration.

447
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,307
Rym: Yes, and we have not explored it fully.

448
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,953
Rym: chess is nowhere near solved.

449
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,539
Scott: No, they're computers that beat everyone.

450
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:22,820
Scott: That's good.

451
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:33,568
Rym: No, hey, whatever things of the day.

452
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:38,730
Rym: So you go in a nother out along with Conrad and we went to the mocha and all that stuff this weekend.

453
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:47,559
Rym: But one thing that you go showed us in the litany of because it's kind of a I don't know front row crew Instead of like shaking hands when we all get together.

454
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,850
Rym: We all show each other all the internet things we've seen recently.

455
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:59,205
Scott: Yeah and some people have all seen the same sort of stuff because they don't go to good sites and other people have seen all sorts of Things because they're internet addicts with nothing to do at work,

456
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:07,044
Rym: but at the same time Some of us like just we're in different circles on the internet, but this is a game.

457
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:14,149
Rym: it's on pixel jam called Dino run and the premise is pretty simple exchange studios and all that.

458
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:20,950
Rym: Basically, you take a little yellow dinosaur and you run away from the apocalypse.

459
00:31:22,153 --> 00:31:24,210
Rym: Now I'm not gonna go into any depth about this game.

460
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,770
Rym: You should probably just play it and you'll figure out what's going on pretty quick.

461
00:31:27,192 --> 00:31:30,166
Rym: All I really want to say is that doom surfing is really fun.

462
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:33,950
Rym: Oh, yeah The the way the game handles it's a lot.

463
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:38,883
Rym: It's very pixely really good control and it reminds me a lot of passage just in the.

464
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:41,310
Rym: it's very artistic and wallets pixely.

465
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,815
Rym: It's very stylistically awesome.

466
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:46,366
Scott: The gameplay reminds me of this one level from kid chameleon.

467
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:54,979
Scott: if you haven't played kid chameleon It's one of the great old Genesis platform games that has been forgotten and if you should really go get it Maybe that should be on the virtual console.

468
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:55,984
Scott: I wonder if it is or isn't.

469
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:08,150
Rym: I Don't know but the effect of the apocalypse when it's coming up behind you is actually really scary and as you get into the higher Levels this game is so unnerving and like all your muscles just tense up and was like

470
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:13,040
Scott: Yeah, even though it's primarily a game of holding right but those stegosaur

471
00:32:13,161 --> 00:32:16,332
Rym: I oh man and it gets a lot harder as time goes On.

472
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:16,896
Rym: don't worry.

473
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:24,930
Scott: The other thing is the game has some interesting stuff you can do that you might not realize like there'll be a Pterodactyl and like if you you know, I think they come at you.

474
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,853
Scott: That's this bad like if I can joust but at the same time sometimes they'll pick you up and carry you farther ahead to help You out.

475
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:32,489
Scott: It's it's pretty, you know, if you do the right thing.

476
00:32:33,232 --> 00:32:36,340
Rym: Also your little avatar the dinosaur is super cute.

477
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:37,062
Scott: He's alright.

478
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,465
Rym: He is super cute.

479
00:32:38,486 --> 00:32:39,288
Rym: You don't understand.

480
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:40,130
Scott: He's not that cute.

481
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:40,893
Rym: Yes, he is.

482
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,985
Rym: Anyway, he waves at you and he wears a crown once you've won.

483
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:50,450
Scott: really I gotta get the crown Alright, so when we were at the mocha, right there was some other stuff going down in the city.

484
00:32:50,551 --> 00:33:09,050
Scott: I don't know if you remember this but way back in the day I don't know how way back in the day But these people played this game of pack Manhattan where they combine sort of GPS computer portable technology But also the real world and the street and human beings to sort of make a game, right?

485
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:16,350
Scott: So people would actually walk around the street to control the Pac-mans and the ghosts you see and that resulted in a pretty fun game.

486
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:18,909
Scott: So they had this event this weekend.

487
00:33:19,552 --> 00:33:21,739
Scott: This is the problem of doing shows unfrequently.

488
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,368
Scott: is that I talked about things after they happened.

489
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:24,950
Scott: Isn't that said?

490
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,070
Scott: Called come out and play festival 2008.

491
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,231
Scott: It was.

492
00:33:28,411 --> 00:33:48,425
Scott: it was this past weekend June 6th through 8th, and they had a whole bunch of games sort of like this And they are all sort of pretty cool and you can read about them and see pictures on their flicker group and all that good stuff of all the cool sort of outdoors Synergistic cool games these people were playing and I like this kind of action.

493
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:51,319
Scott: if it wasn't mocha this weekend I probably would have been doing this.

494
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,170
Scott: In fact, it was sort of a crazy weekend.

495
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,079
Scott: It was like all these events in the city happening simultaneously.

496
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,849
Scott: There was like a. there was also a Kaiju Big Patel on Saturday I believe.

497
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:14,130
Scott: Alright, so way back in the day on the NES if you were a cool kid you had River City Ransom And if you had River City Ransom you probably also had Super Dodgeball and possibly World Cup possibly World Cup.

498
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:27,130
Scott: But you noticed even if you were a dumb kid that these games looked familiar and similar For some reason maybe perhaps because they're both made by the same company or part of the same series of games.

499
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,601
Rym: Now we're not going to get into the whole history of the Kunio Kun franchise.

500
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:32,603
Scott: No, we are not.

501
00:34:32,764 --> 00:34:42,770
Scott: we're going to talk just about mostly Dodgeball because there is a brand new game that just came out for the DS Super dodgeball brawlers and we both got it.

502
00:34:43,091 --> 00:35:00,089
Rym: Now this game is based pretty much straight up on Super Dodgeball for the NES Which well, that's how you all would have known it and when I was a kid This is probably one of my favorite games ever I got to the point where I could beat the entire game on hard without ever once being hit by any ball at any point.

503
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:04,110
Scott: I didn't get that good, but I could definitely beat the game on hard.

504
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,770
Rym: The best part was when you beat the game on hard on any of the settings especially hard without losing anybody.

505
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:23,335
Rym: Then after you beat the Soviet Russians, then you find the evil team the shadow team Which is your team only evil and black and white with lightning in the background and pretty much some of the best music in any NES game ever.

506
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:24,119
Scott: Yeah, that was good.

507
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,890
Scott: I wonder if you can do a similar thing in the DS one.

508
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:26,896
Scott: I haven't made it happen yet.

509
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,290
Rym: I haven't really tried because the single-player is kind of crap.

510
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:31,242
Scott: But anyway, yeah single-player is pretty crap.

511
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:35,418
Scott: Anyway, so Super dodgeball check this the way this thing works.

512
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:36,281
Scott: It doesn't work.

513
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:39,610
Scott: like the dodgeball you play in gym class, right?

514
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,835
Scott: Which actually I like the gym.

515
00:35:41,136 --> 00:35:45,961
Scott: gym dodgeball you play in gym class better as a game But it doesn't work as a video game.

516
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:47,190
Scott: This works as a video game.

517
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,629
Scott: The way it is is there's a field with two squares that are even in size and each square has four guys.

518
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:57,910
Rym: I'm curious if anyone out there is so far removed from gaming that you've never played Super Dodgeball.

519
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,310
Scott: I'm just describing it real quick.

520
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:00,514
Rym: Yeah Yeah I'm just curious.

521
00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:01,539
Scott: and the four guys?

522
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,930
Scott: if they all get hit with the ball and so Enough that their life is completely lost?

523
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:10,563
Rym: Hey guys All right There was only four and I call the new game has four and the the.

524
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:13,557
Rym: I guess the original arcade game had four But the original arcade game is weird.

525
00:36:13,577 --> 00:36:14,361
Rym: We're not gonna talk about.

526
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,009
Scott: the original NES only had three, huh?

527
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,638
Scott: Yeah, I don't remember that.

528
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:17,960
Scott: I see.

529
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,510
Scott: No anyway, the new DS one is four.

530
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:28,674
Scott: There's three or four guys in the box and if you you try to hit the other teams three or four guys in the box with the ball and Then they die.

531
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:34,329
Scott: eventually if you hit them enough with powerful enough moves And then if you eliminate all their guys in the box you win.

532
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:38,509
Scott: You also have three guys on the other sides of the box.

533
00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:41,218
Scott: So Basically, the two boxes are connected.

534
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:44,050
Scott: So it's your three or four guys versus their three or four guys.

535
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:59,303
Scott: but then you also have one guy above the other team one guy below the other team one guy behind the other team to sort of help you out and they have one guy behind you one guy above you one guy below you and You just throw the ball back and forth try and hit the other guy and this super moves.

536
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,035
Scott: and you can do jumping super moves And you can do regular throws.

537
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:14,650
Scott: you can do tricky stuff like by passing the ball like jump up like you're gonna do super move But then pass the ball back to your team and then they throw a super move or throw the ball over their heads Then throw it back over their heads and then throw it at them.

538
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:16,361
Rym: But regardless of all that what made?

539
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:17,770
Rym: at least we'll talk about the original first.

540
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,349
Rym: What made the original game great?

541
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:20,895
Rym: Was that it was a?

542
00:37:20,915 --> 00:37:26,572
Rym: I mean had a single-player and it added like actually had a couple of different like single-player multiplayer modes But nothing really.

543
00:37:27,154 --> 00:37:34,489
Rym: the only thing that was really good about the game was playing versus with another person Absolutely direct straight up.

544
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:40,466
Rym: I am playing against my little brother and one of us is going to win and the game was so.

545
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:44,237
Scott: it was all about Skills of button pressing timing.

546
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:48,430
Scott: I mean you would throw the super move and everyone can see the super move coming from a mile away.

547
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:56,968
Rym: But it's could you push the button with the correct timing to catch the ball and the one great thing is unlike the situation We're in now like Scott is with dr.

548
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:15,063
Rym: Mario or I'm with advanced wars or the way I am with gemfire and all those stupid games that no one in the world likes but me Everyone I knew was just as into super dodgeball as I was so like all of my little friends We'd all get together and play dodgeball all the time yeah, and always be like the because you pick teams at the same time.

549
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:18,227
Rym: the teams are not even at all and It always be the same.

550
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:28,477
Rym: like I would very purposefully pick very quickly and pick the weakest ass team which by the way was England Yeah, and then the other players.

551
00:38:28,497 --> 00:38:29,199
Rym: than a conundrum.

552
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:38,569
Rym: Do they similarly defect and take another crappy team like India or Do they decide to just be a loser and pick Russia and try to beat me?

553
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:51,839
Scott: Yeah, because if they pick Russia and they win whatever it's a lot like playing Mario Kart with the wee wheel instead of using the Nunchuck wiimote combination because if you lose with the wee wheel Well, of course you lost you using the wee wheel.

554
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:55,209
Scott: if you lose with England against Russia, of course you lost.

555
00:38:55,229 --> 00:39:02,383
Scott: you were England They were Russia, but if you win with England against Russia, whoa That's like using the wiimote to beat someone with the better controls.

556
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:03,428
Scott: I mean the the we wheel.

557
00:39:03,629 --> 00:39:06,477
Rym: anyway The game was super awesome.

558
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:16,970
Rym: I remember like and everyone had different super moves, but the game was kind of Undocumented back then and like no one seemed to really remember that you had your air move and your ground move.

559
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:21,330
Rym: But at the Steve on everyone's team because all the teams were kind of the same had three moves.

560
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,890
Rym: He had two ground moves and one air move.

561
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:27,870
Scott: Yep The other thing about the game is that no matter how good anyone got no one ever got to be perfect.

562
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,101
Scott: Like when we were in the duck hunt tournament, we were perfect, but it's super duh.

563
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:32,406
Rym: I don't know.

564
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:40,886
Scott: in multiplayer You'll always Eventually, even if two people are great throw the super move catch it.

565
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:43,161
Scott: throw the super move catch Well, they would try to fool them.

566
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:46,355
Scott: super move catch Well, no if you're someone will eventually not catch it.

567
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:49,644
Rym: really good like actually truly perfect or really good.

568
00:39:49,664 --> 00:39:50,486
Rym: players were playing.

569
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:57,930
Rym: it came down to who Became fatigued the quickest and games would last an hour or more until eventually someone was so tired.

570
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,695
Rym: But that's what dodgeball is.

571
00:39:59,715 --> 00:40:02,604
Scott: Yeah, it's just like a real dodgeball when I was a kid.

572
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:03,447
Rym: I'll tell you this though.

573
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:12,250
Rym: I Thought that Dodge like I always because I had this game one what we would play dodgeball in the yard with all our friends.

574
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:14,450
Rym: We would play it like super dodgeball.

575
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:20,388
Rym: We like I'd run up to the center and jump and throw and that was not a good idea.

576
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:21,170
Rym: Totally awesome.

577
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:33,275
Rym: but beyond that I Always thoughts for the longest time when I was a little kid because of this game That when you were in gym class in school in elementary school playing dodgeball That wasn't a real dodgeball.

578
00:40:33,616 --> 00:40:39,894
Rym: that was wuss dodgeball for little kids and somehow I thought that there was an Olympic sport And I used to.

579
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:55,452
Rym: as far as I was concerned the rules were When someone can't get up anymore and the entire team is knocked unconscious Then your side won and I thought that this was based on that and I thought that they played with a volleyball or maybe a medicine Ball,

580
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:58,484
Scott: maybe that's the ticket to get all the nerds to play.

581
00:40:58,504 --> 00:40:59,870
Scott: We should play some dodge balls.

582
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:04,179
Rym: Well, I ordered a regulation kickball.

583
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,243
Scott: see what that's not see.

584
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,306
Scott: that's enough for one ball.

585
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:07,270
Scott: see the kind of dodgeball.

586
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,280
Scott: Oh, maybe we should just talk about the dodgeballs.

587
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,104
Scott: We played as kids.

588
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:12,357
Scott: That's a separate show I know but I got it.

589
00:41:12,377 --> 00:41:14,410
Scott: I got like a lot of dodgeball things to talk about.

590
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:18,630
Rym: Yeah, we always like we'd play in the gym where if you could make a basket then you let's make a dodgeball week.

591
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,846
Scott: We're doing a Thursday this week.

592
00:41:19,907 --> 00:41:26,952
Rym: Thursday We'll talk about Dodge ball in gym class not Barack Obama and the fact that American politics is finally going in the right direction for the first time In a long time.

593
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:28,479
Rym: No, I'm so excited.

594
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,804
Scott: Anyway, I'm so.

595
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:31,090
Scott: people want to hear about the video games.

596
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:32,566
Rym: Just can't hide it.

597
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:39,510
Scott: So The dodgeball for the DS is largely the same as the original dodgeball.

598
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,640
Scott: However, there are many improvements and changes.

599
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:44,826
Rym: one the super moves.

600
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:45,970
Rym: are there a lot more of them?

601
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,889
Rym: And if you're good, you can't just catch all of them.

602
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:56,970
Scott: Yeah I mean the one that have Rym hates the most is the one where you run up you throw it and it looks like I Faked it and I passed the ball just to the other teammate on the other side.

603
00:41:57,371 --> 00:42:02,170
Scott: But it makes the super move noise and that's the hint you need to know to turn around.

604
00:42:02,512 --> 00:42:09,390
Scott: Cuz it looks like a normal pass that's going slow But then it turns around it goes whoosh and hits you in the ass and does a lot of damage.

605
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:10,397
Scott: I love that one the best.

606
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:12,109
Scott: you got a favorite super move in there.

607
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:12,995
Rym: I don't know.

608
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:17,036
Rym: my favorite super move was still and they have it in this game But it's not quite the same cuz I used to.

609
00:42:17,437 --> 00:42:22,659
Rym: I played this game so much the original that I had like Personalities for all the people on all the teams.

610
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:26,196
Rym: Oh, yeah, definitely and all the moves meant stuff to me And to me.

611
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:31,630
Rym: the nuts shot, you know Like that downward angle disc that the good guy has like the main character good guy.

612
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:34,378
Rym: That was like the good guy move.

613
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,985
Rym: Like that was the noble awesome move of good guy.

614
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:38,630
Scott: That is the noble move indeed.

615
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:41,367
Scott: However, it is also the easily caught move.

616
00:42:42,512 --> 00:42:47,932
Rym: That's another thing is that the move felt like that game did more damage against the evil team at the end even though I know It totally did.

617
00:42:47,972 --> 00:42:53,310
Scott: it is another thing right is that the super moves in the game sort of have this nice balance to them.

618
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,398
Scott: For example, there's one move where all it is.

619
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,550
Scott: It's a straight throw and but it's really fast.

620
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:03,610
Scott: It's easy to catch actually, but if it hits guys it goes straight through them.

621
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:08,330
Scott: So if the other team is all in a clump, you can hit like everyone on the other team with one throw.

622
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,930
Scott: However, that one's really really easy to catch but it also doesn't do a lot of damage.

623
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:20,370
Rym: However, if you use that with the neck ketsu ultimate shot Yeah, I wiped out an entire team in one shower exactly.

624
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,360
Scott: That is the one thing that has been added to this new DS version.

625
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,290
Rym: bunch can be turned off which I love.

626
00:43:26,832 --> 00:43:28,681
Scott: Yeah, everything can be turned off in this which is cool.

627
00:43:29,263 --> 00:43:30,790
Scott: Is this ultimate shot business?

628
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:36,728
Scott: We have this meter and it builds up and catching balls and pass and doing certain certain things builds up your meter.

629
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:42,450
Rym: also Dicking around and not refusing to throw and like just not throwing the ball makes it go down eventually.

630
00:43:42,632 --> 00:43:43,602
Rym: Yeah, which is great.

631
00:43:43,764 --> 00:43:44,290
Scott: It is great.

632
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:48,005
Rym: Hurry up and throw one time to try to win a game against my brother.

633
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:49,090
Rym: They've been going on for a while.

634
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:57,544
Rym: I refuse to play anymore and I just stood there with the ball and I basically told him either you're going to give up or I'm going to sit here until we starve to death.

635
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:09,838
Scott: Yeah anyway, so You get this meter that fills up and when it fills up you get this super super super move and you can choose actually Prior to the match which super move you would like.

636
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:15,509
Scott: one of the moves is like super defense and catching for like a minute or so Stupid except the ultimate shot.

637
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:21,810
Scott: The ultimate shot is pretty much you get one shot to throw the ball and if it actually hits someone they die no matter what.

638
00:44:21,971 --> 00:44:24,058
Scott: And that is the move that everyone picks.

639
00:44:24,118 --> 00:44:25,283
Scott: because how could you God?

640
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:27,170
Scott: How could you not pick?

641
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,149
Scott: Guaranteed kill if you hit someone with the next throw?

642
00:44:30,475 --> 00:44:37,327
Rym: I mean, come on My favorite thing to do and in the original game at least was to run backwards with the accelerator ball.

643
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:41,489
Rym: that I never really saw Until the Russians used it against me in the end of the game.

644
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:46,010
Rym: But you run backwards and throw from the other side and it would get away fast.

645
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,397
Scott: Yeah, cuz it's an accelerator.

646
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:48,542
Scott: It starts out slow.

647
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:52,018
Rym: It didn't actually do any more damage I don't think but it felt real good.

648
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:54,770
Scott: and it also is a lot harder to catch when it was going fast.

649
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:58,607
Scott: So they would start like way in the back goes slow slow slow speed.

650
00:44:58,647 --> 00:44:59,210
Scott: Oh, see don't see it up.

651
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:06,047
Scott: Oh my god is too fast to catch it and it's a lot harder to catch that than the balls of the constant speed You know or the wobbly balls or anything like that.

652
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,517
Scott: All right, so what else they add in this?

653
00:45:08,557 --> 00:45:12,330
Rym: Diaz for hunching kicking and sticks and shit you can throw at each other?

654
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,117
Scott: Oh, yeah, that stuff is kind of good right.

655
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:16,486
Scott: the punching and kicking though is a little.

656
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:16,768
Scott: it's.

657
00:45:16,868 --> 00:45:18,818
Scott: it's a little bit Okay, and a little bit not okay.

658
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:19,200
Rym: I think it.

659
00:45:19,764 --> 00:45:25,008
Rym: the thing is you can turn it off so I can't complain about it at all, but it adds this extra element to the game.

660
00:45:25,048 --> 00:45:28,673
Rym: because Thing is the single-player game is Just don't buy.

661
00:45:28,713 --> 00:45:36,028
Rym: it's not worth it except to be good at the game and when there's no one to play with The only reason to ever play this game is multiplayer against other people.

662
00:45:36,149 --> 00:45:39,690
Rym: Yep The only reason to play the single-player is to get good at multiplayer with other people.

663
00:45:39,851 --> 00:45:43,270
Rym: Yep, don't even bother with the leveling up getting items.

664
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:44,010
Scott: Well, here's the thing.

665
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,014
Scott: Here's the thing that I liked.

666
00:45:45,054 --> 00:45:49,631
Scott: if you play the one player game does leveling up an item is another bullet straight up like River City Ransom.

667
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:50,354
Rym: off is awesome.

668
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:51,638
Rym: buy nice items and such.

669
00:45:51,778 --> 00:45:55,170
Scott: right but it's unnecessary because when it comes time to do multiplayer, right?

670
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:59,583
Scott: Let's say I play through the single-player with not ketsu high school, right?

671
00:45:59,743 --> 00:46:01,428
Scott: Okay, I level them up big time.

672
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:08,262
Scott: now I want to play multiplayer on the team select screen Niketsu high school actually appear twice.

673
00:46:08,543 --> 00:46:10,210
Scott: there'll be white and red versions.

674
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:15,270
Scott: The red version is the leveled up version and the white version is the flat even version.

675
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:23,618
Scott: So you can play with your leveled up stuff if you want to do that sort of game or you can play straight up a fair Game, which is what of course real men do.

676
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,310
Rym: it's kind of like initial D. You turn off the boost exactly exactly.

677
00:46:29,492 --> 00:46:29,592
Scott: Now.

678
00:46:29,632 --> 00:46:35,657
Scott: the one thing we neglected to mention about both up by dodgeball game so far is the brawl Schoolyard mode.

679
00:46:35,797 --> 00:46:36,340
Scott: you see me.

680
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:49,590
Scott: Yes in the original dodgeball There was a schoolyard mode where basically instead of having this sort of structured team game It was an every man for himself game and you the body would just be an open schoolyard.

681
00:46:49,831 --> 00:46:55,647
Scott: Everyone can run wherever they want and throw the ball at whoever they want and the last man alive is the winner.

682
00:46:56,168 --> 00:47:09,959
Scott: and this mode comes back in the new dodgeball with a fierce fierce intensity because For the first time it's eight player wireless multiplayer eight people running around the schoolyard Independently of each other trying to kill each other.

683
00:47:09,979 --> 00:47:12,590
Rym: I don't think you understand how awesome that is.

684
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,463
Scott: The hardest part is getting eight people.

685
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:21,770
Rym: planet gaga God you should see this shit deep and other people ain't talking about disease.

686
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:22,673
Rym: We don't need.

687
00:47:22,713 --> 00:47:29,735
Scott: we do need it cuz it's so awesome to run around eight separate people throwing shit at each other Kicking and plus the kicking and punching in that.

688
00:47:30,096 --> 00:47:30,738
Scott: Oh, come on.

689
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:31,841
Scott: It's good stuff.

690
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:32,101
Rym: Yeah.

691
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:32,442
Rym: Yeah.

692
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:35,770
Rym: Yeah plus just playing multiplayer against other people.

693
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:42,977
Rym: Cuz one thing that's really good is you can customize your team in this perfectly fair Baseball simulator 1000 style of.

694
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:48,328
Rym: pick the special moves pick the names pick the way they look and let me tell you you think you're gonna Pick the way they look.

695
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:59,093
Scott: There are so many faces and hairstyles like you choose the hair the eyes the head the skin color All kinds of stuff.

696
00:47:59,174 --> 00:48:00,998
Scott: There's so many options.

697
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,462
Rym: It's so fantastic.

698
00:48:03,385 --> 00:48:04,066
Rym: I got a minute.

699
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:04,868
Scott: I'm very.

700
00:48:04,888 --> 00:48:06,454
Scott: let's tell people What teams we made?

701
00:48:06,474 --> 00:48:07,378
Rym: Well, I'm very.

702
00:48:07,438 --> 00:48:07,559
Rym: I'm.

703
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,503
Rym: first I made the Romans.

704
00:48:08,523 --> 00:48:09,487
Rym: I dressed him up in togas.

705
00:48:09,507 --> 00:48:10,130
Rym: They had cool names.

706
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,361
Rym: I got sick of that real quick.

707
00:48:11,785 --> 00:48:14,870
Rym: So then I made Da mecha dodgeball.

708
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:17,800
Scott: Oh, man, so you've got who's the heart?

709
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,021
Rym: got usa Hara who can jump really high and he's real fast And I don't know who.

710
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:23,693
Rym: I made the stats all one But I don't know.

711
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:27,530
Scott: so you made the stats actually match the the the character to a point.

712
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,539
Rym: No, okay, but I also made Rym who is just really good.

713
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,043
Scott: See on my team.

714
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:42,030
Scott: I made dodge dango And you see all of my characters, all right, check out the four guys I have in the box are all Zelda bosses.

715
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:47,700
Scott: I've got gliok Not da-dango, but I have mon hondler.

716
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:48,563
Rym: Oh, man.

717
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:52,513
Rym: My hondler was a Goma and Dig dagger.

718
00:48:52,673 --> 00:48:55,402
Scott: right and I made them look like they're supposed to look.

719
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:56,887
Rym: no no Paul's voice.

720
00:48:57,509 --> 00:48:58,392
Scott: No, no No chick.

721
00:48:58,412 --> 00:49:10,809

728
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:47,003
Scott: The other guy has like bat blue bat hair that looks like a bat and the like-like is just sort of blobby And it totally made them look like the Zelda guys thing is.

00:49:47,103 --> 00:49:51,301
Rym: I think I'm gonna make my final team I'm gonna go with and I think it's gonna be chromare high school.

730
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:59,850
Scott: Oh, it's a good one, but Because there are plenty of pompadours in this game for your selection so many different styles of pompadour.

731
00:50:00,274 --> 00:50:06,324
Scott: I mean if you're a pompadour Enthusiast buy this game for no other reason than the hairstyles.

732
00:50:06,665 --> 00:50:07,147
Rym: pretty much.

733
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:09,901
Rym: if I'm gonna we're gonna You know endorse this game or whatever.

734
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:22,370
Rym: the single-player is Really fun if you're still in the stage of your life where River City Ransom is fun for a non-nostalgic way in that You are willing to level up and bullshit buy stuff and you like that sort of thing.

735
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:23,876
Scott: You don't even need to do the leveling up.

736
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:29,910

737
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:40,170
Rym: But where I think the only reason to truly buy this game as opposed to borrowing it from someone is if you plan To play seriously against other people all the time.
