1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,326
Rym: It's Thursday, October 9th.

2
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:12,048
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:12,650
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,235
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:15,600
Rym: Tonight, sandwiches.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,918
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,662
Rym: So, uh, tomorrow night, we're actually gonna go see the amazing Randy.

8
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:35,625
Scott: Oh, right.

9
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:37,190
Scott: I almost completely forgot about that.

10
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:38,994
Rym: You know where it is?

11
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:40,017
Rym: I have no idea.

12
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:41,803
Scott: It's at Rockefeller University.

13
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:42,445
Scott: Oh, great.

14
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:42,786
Rym: Okay.

15
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,090
Scott: Rockefeller for the win.

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,470
Rym: I get out of work at, like, four, so I got plenty of time to go get dinner.

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,639
Scott: Yeah, to be perfectly honest, like, I don't have very high expectations.

18
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,850
Scott: I mean, Randy is someone that I've, uh, admired, you know, for many a year now.

19
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:02,522
Scott: You know, he sort of took me from my "I was skeptical" to "Oh, that's what I am.

20
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:05,449
Scott: I'm like that cranky old guy, only less

21
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:05,830
Scott: old.".

22
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,582
Rym: Uh, but, um... Not quite as jolly, though.

23
00:01:08,844 --> 00:01:09,910
Scott: No, not quite as jolly.

24
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:15,590
Rym: It's amazing how, you know, everyone kind of has this image of him as being, like, the most crumuginy, crumugin that ever lived.

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,092
Rym: He is.

26
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:20,390
Rym: But at the same time, he's super jovial and hilarious all the time.

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,211
Scott: Well, think about that.

28
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:28,468
Scott: Exactly half the time, he is curmudgeonly of all curmudgeons, and the other half of the time, he is jolly of all jollies.

29
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:29,550
Scott: Completely unbalanced.

30
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,252
Rym: But he's jolly.

31
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:31,196
Scott: That's why he's awesome.

32
00:01:31,397 --> 00:01:32,923
Rym: While he's being the curmudgeon.

33
00:01:32,943 --> 00:01:33,104
Rym: I mean...

34
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,450
Scott: I don't know how that works, but it does.

35
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,572
Rym: 'Cause he's being the curmudgeon.

36
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:37,437
Rym: He's basically saying, "All right, kids.

37
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:38,961
Rym: Your homeopathy doesn't work at

38
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:39,162
Rym: all.".

39
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:42,150
Rym: But yet, he's hilarious the whole time he's telling you it doesn't work.

40
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:50,690
Scott: Right, because he's simultaneously angry that these scam artists are pulling these shit, but he's simultaneously laughing at how ludicrous the shit they're pulling is.

41
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,994
Scott: They're like, he's like, "Look, this is so

42
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:52,596
Scott: ludicrous!".

43
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:56,669
Scott: But at the same time, he's crying because, like, people believe this ludicrous shit.

44
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,010
Scott: Oh my god.

45
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,032
Rym: My favorite thing is still.

46
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:03,290
Rym: when he stood before Congress and ate, like, a million homeopathic sleeping pills to point out that they're just BS.

47
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:04,709
Scott: And it didn't mean it didn't do anything.

48
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,570
Rym: He said he got a stomachache because he basically ate a stomach full of sugar pills.

49
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,600
Scott: Well, yeah, those things also have nasty-tasting shit in them.

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,790
Scott: Like, they put all sorts of chemicals in there to make you think it's medicine and whatnot.

51
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,269
Rym: Well, no, that's just basically what pills are made out of.

52
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,239
Scott: Well, no, it's actually, it's like, when you open one of- I've seen these things before.

53
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:22,682
Scott: Like, the Aachen alchem's.

54
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:23,304
Scott: at least, right?

55
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:26,050
Scott: The Aachen alchem, whatever, I can't even pronounce the fucking thing.

56
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,470
Rym: God damn, vitamins and most other pills look the same way.

57
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,275
Scott: No, no, no, no, no.

58
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:31,430
Scott: Aachen alchem comes in a plastic tube, right?

59
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:31,810
Scott: Yes.

60
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,140
Scott: You open the plastic tube and there's this liquid in there and there's some pill floating in the liquid.

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,187
Scott: You're supposed to down the whole thing, but the liquid is like some nasty acid.

62
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,689
Scott: It's not harmful, but it just tastes like shit.

63
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,250
Scott: Well, Scott, usually all of those- And the pill is just sugar.

64
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,770
Rym: Usually all of those things, remember, there's the active ingredients and the inactive ingredients.

65
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,170
Scott: All of the ingredients are inactive.

66
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:58,670
Rym: Well, yes, but in real medicine, the inactive ingredients sometimes are like a solvent or a base or they're just there to kind of keep the thing together.

67
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,611
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

68
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:04,817
Scott: But I'm talking about the homeopathy medicine specifically, they put nasty things in there that taste bad.

69
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,962
Scott: Anyway, right, so we're going to see Randy tomorrow.

70
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,205
Scott: And to be honest, I'm not that excited.

71
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:15,070
Scott: I'm sort of going just so I can see this man while he lives.

72
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,670
Rym: Granted, partly because he's kind of old and I worry that he might die before I get to see him.

73
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,590
Scott: Well, he did have a heart attack recently, but he came right back and he's still rocking.

74
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,710
Rym: But at the same time, we could always just go to the amazing meeting.

75
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:26,314
Scott: We could.

76
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:27,790
Scott: I think we should at some point.

77
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:28,547
Rym: I want to.

78
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:31,768
Scott: But the thing is, maybe we could speak at it.

79
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,390
Rym: Maybe every time Google thinks I'm just going to interrupt you all night.

80
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,650
Rym: Google seems to lump us in with atheist spirituality, among other things.

81
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,211
Rym: Great.

82
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:45,790
Scott: Every time Randy like gives a speech or something, it's like he doesn't have new material is the thing.

83
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,191
Scott: Well, what's?

84
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:50,348
Rym: when has there been a scientific or cultural development?

85
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:50,930
Rym: and homeopathy?

86
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,981
Rym: I mean, we've known it was B.S.

87
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:54,430
Rym: forever.

88
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:56,635
Rym: Yeah, but it's not like.

89
00:03:56,655 --> 00:04:03,902
Rym: it's like chiropractic was made up by a scam artist who is a known scam artist back in the day, like everyone knew.

90
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,510
Rym: he was a scam artist to this day.

91
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:08,930
Rym: We all know he's a scam artist and that he made it up out of nothing.

92
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:12,129
Rym: And yet people still believe it, but nothing's changed.

93
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:12,993
Scott: But it's not.

94
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:19,750
Scott: it's not just the skeptical material like, you know, he's also a magician, but he still uses old magic tricks from back in his magician days.

95
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,790
Rym: I like those old magic.

96
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,685
Scott: I like them, too.

97
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:23,465
Scott: That's why I like Randy.

98
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:23,930
Scott: He's great.

99
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,090
Scott: But he's sort of he's doing the same thing over and over again.

100
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,829
Scott: So not to you know, I'm more entertained when I see something new.

101
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,408
Scott: So I'm not expecting to see anything new.

102
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:36,769
Scott: So if I do see something new, it'll be great.

103
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,170
Scott: Yeah, but it'll be great anyway.

104
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:39,869
Scott: Randy's awesome.

105
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:41,488
Rym: I just don't know what new you could do.

106
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:46,370
Scott: Get older, then you'd be like, wow, he's so old and that makes it new.

107
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,101
Rym: Everyone gets a hold.

108
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:48,730
Rym: That's not new.

109
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:49,334
Rym: I'm old.

110
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:50,953
Scott: Yes.

111
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:53,189
Scott: Like the fact that he's old is not new.

112
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,590
Scott: But if he got even older, then it would be the fact that he was that old would be new.

113
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:02,550
Rym: So I guess if he became older than anyone else had ever been, then it would be new.

114
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:03,150
Scott: Right.

115
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,130
Rym: I don't think he's on track to be the oldest man in the world.

116
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,889
Rym: There's a lot of people a lot older than him.

117
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:08,854
Scott: Yeah.

118
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:09,198
Scott: Yeah.

119
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:10,250
Scott: That's good, though.

120
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,166
Scott: That means he can still talk.

121
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:12,337
Scott: All right.

122
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:13,370
Rym: All right.

123
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,669
Rym: So in your news, what do you got?

124
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:16,729
Scott: Oh, you go first.

125
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:17,125
Scott: Me?

126
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:17,770
Scott: Yeah.

127
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:18,413
Rym: All right.

128
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:23,253
Rym: So this is kind of breaking news, but I'm I'm excited about this because it's one of those kind of.

129
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:32,647
Rym: this is the kind of thing that you would see in like Eagle, the manga or like like there's a guy like Sanctuary, that manga where they're like, what are the Yakuza do?

130
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,155
Rym: They put all the Yakuza in a cruise ship and just take it over to where the other Yakuza are.

131
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,870
Scott: This is this is the kind of awesome thing that would happen in a political mind.

132
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,150
Rym: Yes.

133
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:44,326
Rym: Like this is this is the first thing you couldn't write this guy.

134
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,224
Scott: You just couldn't.

135
00:05:46,550 --> 00:06:01,108
Rym: But basically what happened is Obama is like just breaking news of all the details yet basically said, all right, I'm going to buy a half hour of primetime TV on every major network on October 29th, right before the election.

136
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,605
Scott: And he likes on November 4th.

137
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,505
Scott: Why doesn't he buy it on November 3rd?

138
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,630
Rym: October 29th is probably a better day because that gives more people time to see it.

139
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,806
Rym: And best off, it gives the media enough time to talk about it and make sure everyone's seen it.

140
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:16,644
Scott: No, I see what you're saying.

141
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,326
Scott: I see.

142
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,630
Scott: We won't get around on YouTube if he does it on the news flash.

143
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,230
Rym: That was basically he bought like a half hour of primetime and I think NBC.

144
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:32,169
Rym: And then there was a follow up that was like he's trying to buy the same time slot on every single network.

145
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:39,549
Rym: And now the current news is that he has definitely got CBS and NBC and it says possibly other major networks.

146
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,069
Scott: But the other major networks are ABC and Fox.

147
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:47,050
Rym: Now, the thing I find really funny is that one, I realized what he's doing here.

148
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,350
Rym: If he gets like just two networks, right, what are the other networks going to do?

149
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,730
Rym: What are they going to run across from that?

150
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:55,130
Scott: The American Idol special.

151
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,530
Rym: No, they don't have anything like that.

152
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:08,147
Rym: You realize that the ratings Super Bowl to the advertisers in that slot who aren't with the Obama thing, though he's probably not going to even let ads happen, are fucked and better off.

153
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:12,630
Rym: He doesn't need to buy like CNN or anything, because basically anyone who's not care.

154
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,490
Scott: So I see if they try to put a program on at the same time, no one will buy ads because no one will watch.

155
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:27,150
Scott: That's the only way they can make money for that time slot is to sell to Obama or someone else with enough money or do the thing that I think Obama might be banking on.

156
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:32,387
Rym: I bet news networks will just show the Obama thing and get permission so that they can cover it.

157
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:38,449
Rym: And then basically he's bought them, too, because this is really like this is big news, like it's a big political deal.

158
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,304
Scott: Would that be legal according to the campaign finance?

159
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:40,868
Scott: whatnots?

160
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:42,370
Rym: I have no idea.

161
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:43,670
Rym: Yeah, I can say this, though.

162
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:51,510
Rym: According to the finance law and all this stuff, the networks have to offer John McCain a similar time slot.

163
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,850
Scott: Why don't they have to order but give Bob Barr a similar time slot at the same rate?

164
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,730
Rym: They have to offer it at a similar rate.

165
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,929
Rym: However, as Bob Barr's phone doesn't ring, you know, he's going to court, as has been pointed out by a lot of people.

166
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,450
Rym: McCain can't afford this and neither can anyone because Brahma, Brahma, Barack Obama.

167
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,030
Scott: You made the same mistake as the guy in your thing of the day.

168
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:16,610
Rym: Yeah, because he's in my head.

169
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,948
Rym: I watched that thing like three times.

170
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,770
Rym: He can't afford that.

171
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,810
Rym: Obama has so much money, but I'm actually kind of excited about this.

172
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,790
Scott: I thought McCain if McCain just like doesn't he own a bunch of houses?

173
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,326
Scott: Any rich?

174
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:28,827
Rym: No.

175
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,710
Rym: Remember, he did the public financing.

176
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,390
Rym: There's a limit on how much he can spend and is being provided by the tax people.

177
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,809
Rym: Obama has his own money.

178
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,469
Rym: He can spend as much as he wants.

179
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:41,240
Rym: And he has a lot.

180
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,809
Scott: So basically that he got gets from Hojo.

181
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,270
Rym: Obama gets one gecky guy points in this election.

182
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:55,350
Rym: He is now up one to nothing and gecky guy points.

183
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:02,090
Scott: I just wish I could have had a camera there when, you know, the mafia guy showed up with Obama with a briefcase full of money to help him, you know, get past.

184
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:04,850
Rym: Well, apparently Al Gore raised a bunch of money.

185
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:08,850
Scott: But as Al Gore is the now, wait a minute, that doesn't make sense.

186
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,849
Rym: Basically, McCain got a quarter of a gecky guy point for pulling his.

187
00:09:13,672 --> 00:09:16,450
Rym: Oh, let's suspend our campaigns and go save the economy.

188
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,909
Rym: But then he lost that point when he typically failed at it.

189
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:19,988
Rym: And Obama, I don't know.

190
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,370
Scott: Neither one of them has impressed me by going to a bar in Texas.

191
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:24,689
Rym: No, they haven't.

192
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:31,069
Rym: However, by eating cake, one gecky guy point is more gecky guy than most men will ever achieve.

193
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,310
Scott: Perhaps, but neither in one day.

194
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,169
Rym: Neither one of these men is accomplished years to do.

195
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,670
Scott: Neither one of these men has reached that level of accomplishment.

196
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,729
Rym: No, but you know what?

197
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,794
Rym: This is like he's.

198
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:46,648
Rym: basically all Obama has to do is stab his hand and I'm with him.

199
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,370
Rym: All right.

200
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:49,028
Rym: That's all I got.

201
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:50,270
Rym: I can't talk more.

202
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,110
Rym: It's all speculation.

203
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,023
Rym: The news is basically OMG, OMG.

204
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:54,621
Rym: And that's it.

205
00:09:55,751 --> 00:09:59,929
Scott: Well, you know, Scott says politics news is all bullshit, which it is.

206
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:08,990
Scott: So I'm going to give you the real news, the best real news that I have seen in months, perhaps in the year of 2008.

207
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,930
Scott: This is the best news that I've seen.

208
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,486
Scott: You ready for this?

209
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:13,510
Scott: OK, I don't know if you saw this or not.

210
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,969
Scott: Ready as a guy in Germany named Karl Merck.

211
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:18,929
Scott: Right.

212
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,729
Scott: And he's a farmer.

213
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:23,870
Rym: All right.

214
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:30,590
Scott: And what happened was he was on the farm and he was, you know, as farms go, they have.

215
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:31,400
Rym: Oh, this guy.

216
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,110
Scott: They have big machines on farms.

217
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,810
Scott: And this is amazing.

218
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,009
Rym: I was going to save this for Monday, but I guess you preempted me.

219
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,029
Scott: I preempted you.

220
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:47,569
Rym: This is definitely a Monday news, but I was actually really excited about this because I didn't think we were at the point where this could be done.

221
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:55,290
Scott: So the guy's a farmer in Germany, big machines on the farm, hit a corn shredder, corn shredders and nasty machine.

222
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,390
Scott: I imagine I don't know what a corn shredder looks like or how it works.

223
00:10:58,632 --> 00:10:59,068
Rym: I will Google him.

224
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,430
Scott: I imagine it is similar to a wood chipper.

225
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:04,709
Rym: But anyway, I'll say this.

226
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:06,990
Rym: I've been around wood chippers living in Michigan.

227
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:11,330
Rym: I am really afraid of wood chippers in Connecticut.

228
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,530
Scott: In Connecticut, there was a famous wood chipper murder.

229
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,170
Scott: A guy stuffed his wife in the wood chipper.

230
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,870
Rym: There was a Michigan wood chipper murder.

231
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,349
Rym: He stuck his wife in a wood shedder.

232
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:24,489
Scott: And then there's a famous forensic scientist in Connecticut who works at one of the Connecticut, like labs or whatever.

233
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,537
Scott: And he went to.

234
00:11:25,638 --> 00:11:26,469
Scott: he investigated that.

235
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,749
Scott: And that's sort of why he's famous.

236
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:28,730
Scott: Big anyway.

237
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:34,190
Scott: So the guy was on the farm, rainy day on the farm, putting corn in the corn shredder.

238
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:36,169
Scott: And the corn shredder stops.

239
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:37,090
Scott: Right.

240
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,350
Scott: So he goes over.

241
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,387
Rym: So what do you not do?

242
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:40,729
Rym: What this guy did?

243
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:43,870
Scott: Well, he goes to poke at it and see what's wrong.

244
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:46,850
Scott: And it's a rainy day.

245
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,528
Scott: So he slipped.

246
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,150
Scott: His hand got stuck in the corn shredder.

247
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:52,502
Rym: As it turned back on.

248
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,650
Rym: All I'm going to say is I'm looking for pictures of corn shredders.

249
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,089
Rym: I found two corn on the cob shaped dildos.

250
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:00,530
Scott: Good, good job.

251
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:01,490
Rym: OK, continue.

252
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:11,090
Scott: And of course, his natural reflex when one hand got caught in the corn shredder was, you know, not the not the thinking reflex, you know, the muscle memory reflex.

253
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,249
Scott: You know, the not thinking quick reaction was to put the other hand in there to pull the first hand out.

254
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,530
Scott: And as you can expect, both arms went in the corn shredder.

255
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,530
Scott: There's a picture of shredder and the Ninja Turtle shredder.

256
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,370
Rym: Yes, because there is also an unrelated picture of popcorn on the same Web page.

257
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:30,908
Scott: All right.

258
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:36,570
Scott: The guy lost both his arms to the corn shredder after the corn shredder shredded his arms.

259
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,208
Scott: He was lying on the ground, basically saying, kill me, which is probably what I would be saying.

260
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:49,148
Scott: But his friend on the farm went and got help and he lived with with no arms and he's still alive with no arms.

261
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:55,150
Scott: Well, that's not true anymore until today or very recently, the past few days.

262
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:59,601
Scott: For the first time ever there, let's see, 40 doctors spent 16 hours, right?

263
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:09,290
Scott: Someone else must have died and they took the dead person's arms and put them on this dude's body.

264
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:17,030
Scott: And now he has arms and he can open doors and turn the lights on and off with new arms.

265
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,689
Scott: You can't really do anything with the hands and the fingers yet.

266
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:20,210
Rym: Yeah.

267
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:26,629
Rym: And they're saying that there's a good chance he'll regain a surprising percentage of his arm functionality.

268
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:26,906
Scott: Yeah.

269
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:31,248
Scott: Pretty much the big worry is that his body will reject the arms, you know, but so far it hasn't.

270
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,950
Scott: And the outlook is as good as can be expected for the first ever dual arm transplant.

271
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:37,785
Scott: It's looking good.

272
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:39,270
Scott: It's looking pretty good.

273
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:46,348
Scott: And he's like he went from lying on the ground saying, oh, God, kill me to oh, my God, I have new arms.

274
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:47,969
Scott: This is the best thing ever.

275
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:52,347
Scott: So everyone out there who's listening, I assume that most of you have arms.

276
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,970
Rym: Well, first, get a wood chipper.

277
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,690
Scott: Well, no, don't take your arms for granted.

278
00:13:59,075 --> 00:13:59,288
Rym: Yes.

279
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,850
Rym: I mean, seriously, one, I was I remember a time I was using a wood chipper and it jammed.

280
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:07,689
Rym: It would only would have been comical.

281
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:13,829
Rym: You would have seen me standing like 10 feet away from this thing with a long stick, like gingerly poking at.

282
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,549
Scott: That's right.

283
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:17,710
Scott: And remember, you know, from shop class, what are the things?

284
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,689
Scott: What are the things you learn?

285
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,649
Rym: My shop teacher was missing three fingers.

286
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:22,590
Scott: Well, shop and shop class.

287
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,052
Scott: I learned.

288
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:28,089
Scott: the most important thing I learned was this number one most important thing you have on your entire body.

289
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,710
Scott: Your eyes don't damage your eyes.

290
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,769
Scott: Therefore, goggles come before everything else.

291
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,130
Rym: Number two, do not send with the fucking bandsaw.

292
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,430
Rym: What the hell is wrong with you?

293
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,928
Rym: I can't cut his finger off in my middle school because he's sanding a piece of wood with the side of the blade on the bandsaw.

294
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,790
Scott: Number two, most important thing you have on your body, assuming your body.

295
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,850
Rym: Wait, Scott, you cut his fucking finger.

296
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,243
Scott: All right.

297
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:51,908
Scott: I know, right?

298
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:53,168
Scott: Is your hands.

299
00:14:54,491 --> 00:15:01,010
Scott: So this guy lost number two on the important pieces of the body list, you know, to not get hurt in shop class.

300
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:04,409
Scott: So think about your arms.

301
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:06,870
Scott: Don't put them in a wood chipper.

302
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:07,981
Scott: Don't rely.

303
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,929
Scott: Don't you know, you don't want to be the second person to ever have, you know, dual arm.

304
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:14,570
Scott: What's it called?

305
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,449
Scott: Replacement surgery.

306
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,950
Rym: You want to be like the thousandth because by then they'll be robot.

307
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,949
Scott: Well, the outlook, though, on this is very good.

308
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:25,989
Scott: I imagine for military peoples who got blowed up.

309
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:34,670
Rym: How about two things of the day?

310
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,190
Scott: And now Rims going back to bullshit politics again, isn't he?

311
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:37,566
Rym: I am.

312
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,130
Rym: However, don't worry.

313
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:46,909
Scott: Don't worry, because I can't wait until later November, because then all people talk about is football and all this bullshit will go.

314
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,809
Rym: No, no, they're not.

315
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,190
Rym: Because if you haven't noticed, the economy is I'll put it this way.

316
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:58,808
Rym: I made my Mad Max joke to the one person at my job who apparently had not heard me make my Mad Max joke.

317
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:01,310
Rym: And I saw a real life.

318
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:06,685
Rym: Basically, we're talking about, you know, Apple and I like all the stocks are collapsing and oh, my God.

319
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:10,609
Scott: And you said either Apple is going to go up or Mad Manx.

320
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:17,830
Rym: Well, I said I feel like right now, not Apple, but just in general, I should be investing all my money in the stock market.

321
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,110
Rym: And he's like, isn't that really risky?

322
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:27,410
Rym: And I'm like, oh, yeah, but basically it's not a risk at all, because either it's going to go back up in the long run and I'm going to be filthy rich or it's Mad Max.

323
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,748
Rym: There's nothing I could have done about it.

324
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:32,729
Rym: And he stops and he says, so we'll all have to wear pleather.

325
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:37,347
Rym: And then we all just like we we all lost it.

326
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:38,649
Rym: Oh, my God.

327
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,330
Rym: I believe I said and will magically all still have plenty of cheap gas.

328
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,330
Rym: I feel like I got to watch that movie.

329
00:16:47,531 --> 00:16:49,409
Rym: I haven't seen that movie since I was a kid on the Roku.

330
00:16:49,691 --> 00:16:50,329
Rym: I think it is.

331
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:50,928
Rym: If it's not.

332
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:52,110
Rym: Oh, my God.

333
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,250
Scott: Are there multiple Mad Max's beyond this Mad Max?

334
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,610
Rym: The Mad Max beyond Thunderdome beyond Thunderdome is what you want to see.

335
00:16:58,991 --> 00:16:59,213
Scott: Oh, my God.

336
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:05,310
Rym: OK, but my thing of the day here is not actually the politics.

337
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,189
Rym: It's not Mad Max.

338
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:07,108
Rym: The video.

339
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,789
Scott: What the hell we care about it for, Skip?

340
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,621
Rym: The video is this video someone posted in the forums of.

341
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:14,430
Rym: basically there's this McCain rally, right?

342
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,150
Rym: And all these McCain people are standing in line to go see McCain.

343
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,608
Rym: Now, I don't want to make a political statement here, but I want to point something out.

344
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:38,229
Rym: Any time you see people lined up to see Barack Obama, it's either hippies or generally attractive, hipstery 20 somethings or old, like middle aged and up uppity, you know, middle class liberals, you know, all the types.

345
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:43,550
Rym: And if you look at a McCain rally, it's fat, scary old people and young Republicans.

346
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:47,190
Rym: And I got to say, no one in this line was attractive.

347
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:52,628
Rym: But across the way, there's a few Obama people standing there with signs and placards just doing their thing.

348
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:55,529
Rym: And this guy just videotapes this line.

349
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:57,194
Scott: I don't want to see.

350
00:17:57,817 --> 00:18:04,930
Scott: I respect people's right to protest and hold signs for whatever they want, even if it's, you know, kill babies or something crazy like that.

351
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:06,670
Scott: If they're just holding up a sign, it's all cool.

352
00:18:06,873 --> 00:18:06,990
Scott: Right.

353
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,590
Rym: Wait, wait, wait.

354
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,508
Rym: It's always all cool.

355
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:10,009
Rym: What if I'm pro goatsey?

356
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:10,910
Scott: That's fine.

357
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,797
Scott: Is it by me?

358
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:16,390
Rym: OK, so I can have the goatsey sign outside your front door.

359
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:17,630
Scott: If I was king of the world.

360
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,142
Scott: Absolutely.

361
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,168
Scott: I would encourage it.

362
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:19,868
Scott: You could have that.

363
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,989
Scott: You could have the two girls, one cup video sign if I was king of the world.

364
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:25,289
Scott: Scott, what?

365
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:27,529
Rym: You haven't seen that.

366
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,250
Scott: Yeah, I wouldn't look at it, but you could hold it up if you wanted to.

367
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:32,269
Scott: I still I would know what it was and look away.

368
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:42,430
Scott: Anyway, the point I'm trying to make here is that what do you know if I was going to protest and there are situations where Scott would protest and demonstrate, I have protested and demonstrate.

369
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:47,150
Scott: I have also in the past, minorly, I wouldn't do it without purpose.

370
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:52,930
Scott: You know, it's like why would you hold up an Obama sign to in front of a line of McCain supporters?

371
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:54,804
Scott: It's not going to have any effect whatsoever.

372
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,870
Scott: One freaked the squares to the better ways to freak those squares to be a better one.

373
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:05,150
Rym: to this video, because two is the hilarious reactions.

374
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:08,510
Rym: I mean, Ron Paul dig people aside.

375
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:20,250
Rym: I mean, I think Emily gave me a new term because we were talking about, you know, our generation and how, like, you know, you look at people in the previous generations who like actually fall for spam and all those things.

376
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:21,910
Rym: And, you know, we don't fall for spam.

377
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:24,190
Rym: And I was like, yeah, we're much more canny than the previous.

378
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:26,427
Scott: We fall for Ron Paul, 9/11 conspiracy theories.

379
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,150
Rym: And Emily turns to me and says, Arim, dig Ron Paul.

380
00:19:30,817 --> 00:19:31,110
Scott: Yeah.

381
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:32,990
Rym: And I feel like dig Ron Paul.

382
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:37,450
Rym: All one word is the word for the thing that got our generation.

383
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:40,929
Scott: They also fall for, you know, bullshit, natural hippie stuff, too.

384
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,670
Rym: No, but not our whole generation.

385
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,870
Rym: Like, I feel like our generation, like the Internet generation savvy to the Internet.

386
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,370
Rym: people in our generation dig Ron Paul is the equivalent of spam to the previous generation.

387
00:19:53,570 --> 00:20:06,570
Rym: But anyway, aside from the dig around Ron Paul people, if you take off a bunch of McCain Republicans or just Republicans in general, their responses are always hilarious and scary.

388
00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:08,930
Rym: But that's not, you know, watch this video, whatever.

389
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:18,350
Rym: I just want to point out that the gentleman who says something at exactly a minute eight minutes, unintentionally hilarious.

390
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,570
Rym: And I'm going to leave it at that.

391
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:28,810
Scott: Unintentionally hilarious only to Futurama fans and probably only to Futurama fans in the front row crew, because you know how you'll be watching a show.

392
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,410
Scott: And there are things that everyone references from a show.

393
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,349
Scott: For example, in The Simpsons, everyone will reference don't.

394
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:34,561
Scott: Right.

395
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:35,307
Scott: You know what that is.

396
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:39,610
Scott: Everyone will reference no beer, no TV may come or something.

397
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:40,927
Scott: Go crazy.

398
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:50,030
Scott: But very few people remember a line such as zombie eat brain, but zombie cannot swallow these injustice.

399
00:20:50,830 --> 00:21:00,150
Scott: So this guy references Futurama, but it's a line of Futurama that only the hardcore fan like us will recognize and associate with Futurama.

400
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,008
Rym: We have that Jackalope barbecue near us.

401
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:03,250
Scott: It's a coincidence.

402
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:04,927
Scott: It has to be a coincidence.

403
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,890
Rym: It says one, there's two Futurama.

404
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:10,090
Rym: I'll explain this another day.

405
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,010
Rym: It's too much.

406
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,729
Rym: And also, I feel like get a job is a really common reference, but I'm not sure.

407
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:16,788
Rym: So let us know if you know what get a job is.

408
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,629
Scott: But I'm sure people know now.

409
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:27,590
Rym: Suffice to say, the guy who says get a job at a minute eight is like, oh, my, I don't know what to say.

410
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:33,188
Scott: Matt Groening should call him up to say Farnsworth if the current guy goes out to this guy and be like, did you know?

411
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:35,309
Rym: Are you really just that guy?

412
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,448
Scott: He's just that guy.

413
00:21:36,631 --> 00:21:37,107
Rym: Oh, my God.

414
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,290
Scott: He waits in line with coupons at the grocery store.

415
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:43,088
Rym: So check out fired that guy at a minute eight.

416
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:44,548
Scott: All right.

417
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:45,970
Scott: Oh, that was your thing today.

418
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:46,648
Rym: Yeah, it was.

419
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,548
Rym: You got a thing of the day.

420
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,790
Scott: Did we even pause after the news?

421
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:50,176
Rym: Yes.

422
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,970
Rym: I remember doing it like a five minute pause when I was doing something.

423
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,470
Scott: So check this out, right?

424
00:21:56,571 --> 00:21:59,210
Scott: We like rice here at GeekNights.

425
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:02,010
Rym: You know, the eating kind and the laugh at kind.

426
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,150
Scott: This is an instance of the laugh at kind.

427
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:11,830
Scott: Now, car modification is something that in general, the idea of modifying vehicles is an old geek tradition.

428
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,970
Scott: There is something truly geeky and awesome about modifying a car.

429
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,589
Scott: Modifying anything for awesome is awesome.

430
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:19,570
Scott: So a car more awesome.

431
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:19,970
Scott: Right.

432
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,510
Scott: I mean, hot rod culture, wicked cool in the Book of Geek.

433
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,030
Scott: Right.

434
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:34,130
Scott: The problem is, right, is that there are some people today they modify their cars, not for looks, not for enhanced performance.

435
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:40,610
Scott: Well, they think it's enhanced performance and they think it's enhanced looks, but really it is decreased looks and decreased performance.

436
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:41,010
Scott: Right.

437
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:44,010
Scott: It's basically they do a mod to make it worse.

438
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:50,270
Scott: Usually when someone does like a case mod to their computer, even if they make it worse cooling wise or something, it looks cool.

439
00:22:50,376 --> 00:22:50,566
Scott: Right.

440
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:54,350
Scott: Even, you know, some neon lights can look cool some of the time.

441
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:54,542
Scott: Right.

442
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,069
Scott: If it's just a simple mod like that.

443
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:00,790
Scott: And most mods you see, like a lot of, you know, steampunk mods are cool.

444
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:07,569
Scott: The problem we have is when these people modify their cars and make them worse, they basically just ruin the cars.

445
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,470
Scott: Right.

446
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:18,170
Scott: And this is where occasion, you know, I can respect their hobby that they have something they enjoy, but I just laugh at them because it's they're doing a bad job.

447
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:23,409
Scott: And they think it's not that they're doing a bad job is that they're doing a bad job and they think they're doing a good job.

448
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:28,150
Rym: This is like the equivalent of a dude who like drills holes in his RAM.

449
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,710
Scott: It's like the guy who tried to overclock his computer by like, you know, submerging the video card in water.

450
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:33,989
Scott: You know, it's like that.

451
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,307
Scott: Right.

452
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:41,330
Scott: So what we have here right is I'm going to explain this because a little complicated.

453
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,167
Scott: It's one of those, you know, weird forum softwares that they use on all sorts of crappy auto forums.

454
00:23:46,574 --> 00:23:47,350
Scott: And it's hard.

455
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,269
Scott: You know, the pictures are really big and there's like 20 pages to go through to see all this stuff.

456
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:54,190
Scott: So, you know, let me let me give you the rundown.

457
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:54,570
Scott: Right.

458
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,230
Scott: This is an auto forum, specifically lancer register dot com.

459
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,910
Scott: These are people who like, you know, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolutions, which is a very cool car, high quality car indeed.

460
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:23,690
Scott: And someone on this forum went to another auto forum club Jappo dot com, which appears to be a Spanish autumn, you know, as in Spain, not Mexico's, you know, Spanish, Japanese, you know, car modification forum where racers hang out.

461
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:24,028
Scott: Right.

462
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:27,763
Scott: And on this forum, some guy was modifying his.

463
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:30,470
Scott: I believe it's a Mitsubishi Eclipse that he is modifying.

464
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,089
Scott: All right.

465
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:39,050
Scott: And he's modifying it for what he says is, you know, enhanced performance, you know, a bajillion RPM, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

466
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,650
Scott: Right now, that's that's well and good.

467
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:47,730
Scott: You know, a guy modifying is, you know, what I just say, I have in trouble here.

468
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,949
Scott: Mitsubishi Eclipse, right?

469
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,670
Scott: Because the Mitsubishi Lancer evolution form, that's why it's a Mitsubishi Eclipse.

470
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,100
Scott: OK.

471
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,190
Scott: And he's modifying this eclipse.

472
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:07,070
Scott: But there's the these the pictures and also videos, if you go through enough pages of the forum to find them, you know, there's incredibly long forum thread that's tedious to read and just look at the pictures and the threads.

473
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:11,648
Scott: The first pictures that you'll see on the front page tell you right away something is going on.

474
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:18,230
Scott: The guy is taking a hand file and forging grooves into the heads in his engine.

475
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:34,542
Scott: What he says, I guess if you read some of the text in the forum, this guy thinks that these three like these claw marks, basically that he's hand filed into the engine will increase the flow of fuel into the middle of the.

476
00:25:34,562 --> 00:25:35,745
Scott: I don't know what.

477
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:37,290
Scott: then there's a picture.

478
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,810
Scott: And I don't know what's up with this picture, but basically he's got a grinder.

479
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:47,386
Scott: You're like a big stone, you know, motorized grinder is going across like the top of the engine, I guess.

480
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:48,348
Scott: Smoothie.

481
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:57,270
Scott: I don't know what's going on here, but you continue through this thread and it's basically this guy just ruining this car systematically.

482
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,230
Scott: And at one point they try to actually start the car and just fuel leaks everywhere.

483
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:08,570
Scott: And it is, you know, he may not have succeeded in modifying his car the way he thinks.

484
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:09,270
Scott: Right.

485
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:10,074
Scott: Anyway, he might.

486
00:26:10,094 --> 00:26:14,032
Scott: he might have just ruined the car and wasted a bunch of money, but he's provided.

487
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:21,270
Scott: whatever money he spent was totally worth it in terms of the humor that has been provided to so many people looking at this thread.

488
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,328
Scott: And even if you don't understand cars and how they work, maybe this thread will actually show you.

489
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,949
Scott: I mean, it's sort of a bad, you know, I would even worry about that.

490
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:40,290
Rym: This is one of those situations where you might have no idea what's going on, like you you have no comprehension at all of what is actually physically being done, like what the mechanics of it are or the rationale.

491
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:46,110
Rym: But you look at it and you intuit that whatever it is is a bad idea.

492
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:47,649
Scott: Well, I was going to say that.

493
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:53,809
Scott: But, you know, in addition, not knowing anything about cars, this is sort of one of those learn by bad example things.

494
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:58,709
Scott: You know, you don't know anything about cars, but you see this, you know, this is wrong.

495
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:00,708
Scott: Even if you don't know what's wrong, you see it.

496
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:03,790
Scott: And no, anyone who's not an idiot can tell this is wrong.

497
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:09,050
Scott: But in the process of seeing that wrongness, you'll know what rightness is in a way.

498
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,910
Scott: And maybe you'll see some parts of cars.

499
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,850
Rym: I guess wrongness is grinding your engine up for no good reason.

500
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,450
Rym: Not this is not grinding your engine out for no good reason.

501
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,790
Scott: Taking a hand file to put grooves in it for no reason.

502
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:29,050
Scott: Spray painting everything blue, spray painting the axles red, spray painting the suspension green.

503
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:37,030
Rym: So before we go any further, I would like to say that because I got to get this out because I don't really want to talk about them in too much detail.

504
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:42,510
Rym: But the Bellas makes them better than like anyone I've ever run into.

505
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,370
Scott: Almost anyone.

506
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,269
Rym: I mean, here's the thing.

507
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,590
Rym: Other people have made better.

508
00:27:46,892 --> 00:27:47,648
Rym: Like they have better meat.

509
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,690
Rym: You know, the head, the sell the special meat, the cured meat, all these different things.

510
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:54,229
Rym: And some people have better bread.

511
00:27:54,852 --> 00:28:02,350
Rym: But I've never been to a place that makes sandwiches that has the level of meat combined with the level of bread.

512
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,910
Scott: How about the Italian place in McGivsey?

513
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,068
Rym: That place is OK.

514
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,487
Scott: How about like Carnegie Deli?

515
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:11,187
Scott: They secure their own pastrami's.

516
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,210
Scott: But the bread, the bread of the Carnegie Deli is amazing.

517
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,808
Scott: Yeah, but I don't know every day.

518
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:22,369
Rym: See, I guess I'd have to eat one of them and eat a develop sub within a couple of hours of each other to really know you want to do it.

519
00:28:23,314 --> 00:28:23,546
Scott: How?

520
00:28:23,913 --> 00:28:25,126
Scott: We'd go to the Carnegie Deli.

521
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,470
Scott: You'd get on JetBlue and fly to Rochester and eat at the Bellas.

522
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:29,650
Scott: You take 45 minute flight.

523
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:30,488
Rym: We could.

524
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,125
Scott: We could.

525
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,430
Scott: And then fly back and eat at the Carnegie Deli again because it will win.

526
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,670
Scott: Oh, I'm throwing it down.

527
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,430
Rym: We should start taking donations to do the ultimate sandwich challenge.

528
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:44,170
Scott: But someone else is going to give us like another place we're going to have to fly to.

529
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,156
Scott: Like so we're going to have to go like.

530
00:28:45,317 --> 00:28:46,465
Scott: they'll say, oh, you're not going to.

531
00:28:46,606 --> 00:28:49,170
Scott: it doesn't count if you don't go to Philly to eat a cheesesteak.

532
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,090
Scott: Oh, it doesn't count if you don't go to this place in, you know, Seattle.

533
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:56,730
Rym: I've had better cheesesteaks in many places other than Philly.

534
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,810
Scott: I just I've never actually in a cheesesteak in Philadelphia, in the city of Philadelphia.

535
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,530
Scott: I've eaten a cheesesteak in Pennsylvania, but not Philadelphia.

536
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:03,826
Scott: I have.

537
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:04,708
Rym: I was unimpressed.

538
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:08,470
Scott: Was it at one of the like actual places that is people lining up in the morning?

539
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:09,349
Rym: I don't know.

540
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,609
Rym: It was some like street guy.

541
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:11,830
Scott: Yeah, I don't think that counts.

542
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,049
Scott: I think it has to be one of the places.

543
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,369
Rym: Yeah, I don't know any one of the places.

544
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:15,170
Rym: I don't know.

545
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,929
Rym: Sometimes I see people lined up at places that suck in New York.

546
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:19,190
Scott: So that it's all so true.

547
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,828
Scott: I don't know what the places are, but I'm sure if you ask around or search on the Internet, you'll find like what the place is.

548
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,490
Rym: We're talking about sandwiches.

549
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,070
Scott: I know the thing about the sandwich is a very old and very important food.

550
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:30,670
Scott: Right.

551
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:36,270
Scott: The sandwich is the one food that mirrors exactly the food pyramid.

552
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,810
Scott: If you ate nothing but sandwiches, then your nutrition would be perfect.

553
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:49,450
Scott: You would have mostly bread, then vegetables and fruits, then meats and dairies, and then some maybe sugars and oils.

554
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,049
Scott: You got some salad dressing on there or something.

555
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:52,670
Rym: Molasses is last.

556
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,810
Scott: It's the perfect metaphor of the food pyramid in every way.

557
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:02,330
Scott: And I believe that not only, you know, because of this, the food pyramid is not just the food pyramid.

558
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:04,050
Scott: It is also the sandwich pyramid.

559
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:09,189
Scott: You see, the most important thing in a sandwich as the most important thing in the food pyramid is, of course, the bread.

560
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:14,726
Rym: And this is why, while de Bellas uses commodity meats, this is going to be a de Bellas head, don't worry.

561
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:23,069
Scott: Well, it's only because Rym worked at de Bellas that he, you know, I worked at Crossroads making sandwiches and the sandwiches there were, you know, as good as they could be.

562
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:27,770
Scott: You know, I tried to help people out, but eventually they cracked down on me giving people too much meat.

563
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:28,089
Scott: Yeah.

564
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:28,792
Rym: And it was just.

565
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:42,390
Rym: all things aside, the bread counts for a lot more than the meat because I've had sandwiches from like kosher delis that had like some of the best meat I've ever seen, but they had the same stupid prepackaged bread that every stupid bar's head deli has.

566
00:30:42,752 --> 00:30:44,109
Rym: So as a result, the sandwich was weak.

567
00:30:44,752 --> 00:30:44,930
Scott: Exactly.

568
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:48,629
Rym: The bread is or, you know, similar places because there are places that are that good.

569
00:30:49,171 --> 00:30:54,749
Rym: Use commodity meat, but they have fresh baked bread and that like that counts for so much.

570
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:58,430
Scott: When you have the bread is the thing that holds the sandwich together.

571
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,170
Scott: So the bread is structural in addition to flavorful.

572
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,790
Scott: If the structure of the bread does not hold up, the sandwich falls apart.

573
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,770
Scott: And now you basically have a salad, right?

574
00:31:07,175 --> 00:31:07,788
Scott: That's no good.

575
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:13,290
Scott: So you the bread has to hold up, but at the same time, the bread is to taste good.

576
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,770
Scott: You don't want to be too hard that it sort of hurts to eat it.

577
00:31:15,894 --> 00:31:16,449
Scott: Not so good.

578
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,769
Scott: You know, too soft.

579
00:31:18,012 --> 00:31:19,030
Scott: Then it's going to get squishy.

580
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:20,810
Scott: That's also no good, right?

581
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,910
Scott: But also the bread can't be stale.

582
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,869
Scott: It's got to be flavorful.

583
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,670
Scott: You got to get some sesame seeds on there.

584
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:32,810
Scott: You know, now you got to have a good crust, but at the same time, beyond the cross, the bread itself, you want to be very absorbent and not crusty.

585
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,389
Scott: So all the nice juices of flavor get into the bread.

586
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:45,710
Scott: Because remember, when you bite into a sandwich, you know, if it's a proper sandwich, the bread is the first thing that touches your tongue and most of the volume of what you are eating.

587
00:31:46,012 --> 00:31:48,070
Scott: It's going to be bread, not mass, but you realize.

588
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:52,910
Rym: No, because think about the way the chewing motion goes when you bite in and pull in and then suck into your mouth.

589
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:55,830
Rym: Your tongue is actually going to touch the lettuce first.

590
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,509
Rym: Most likely.

591
00:31:56,977 --> 00:31:57,450
Scott: I don't know.

592
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,770
Scott: My tongue touches the bread first.

593
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,370
Scott: And then once you choose, everything sort of falls out.

594
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:06,389
Rym: I guess it would touch the bottom of the bread if you stuck your tongue out before you bit in, but then you're just weird.

595
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:09,230
Scott: I guess I just put more sandwich in my mouth at once.

596
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,110
Scott: You know, the bread goes well beyond the tooth.

597
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:13,209
Scott: When I bite down, it shouldn't go that far in.

598
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,069
Rym: It goes pretty far.

599
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,850
Rym: You're not going to taste the bread until it gets salivated.

600
00:32:17,191 --> 00:32:17,828
Rym: So you're really.

601
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,290
Rym: All right.

602
00:32:19,431 --> 00:32:20,550
Rym: I think we just move on to the sandwich.

603
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:22,148
Rym: I'll put it this way.

604
00:32:23,512 --> 00:32:26,789
Rym: If you have to make a snap decision, what's your favorite sandwich?

605
00:32:28,652 --> 00:32:29,110
Rym: Snap decision.

606
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:29,789
Rym: Don't think about it.

607
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,125
Rym: Just go.

608
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,249
Rym: That's the honest answer.

609
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:32,069
Scott: When I just ate.

610
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:32,619
Rym: I don't know.

611
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:33,546
Rym: Come on.

612
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,388
Rym: What kind of sandwich?

613
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:36,590
Rym: Class of sandwiches.

614
00:32:37,876 --> 00:32:40,010
Rym: I don't think you put nearly enough thought into your sandwiches.

615
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,610
Scott: No, not really.

616
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:46,270
Scott: Basically, I enjoy most sandwiches for anything that you don't like.

617
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,889
Rym: Cold cuts, any cold cuts.

618
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,830
Scott: I like kosher salami.

619
00:32:50,132 --> 00:32:50,443
Rym: That's it.

620
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,650
Rym: You've you've classed out.

621
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,769
Rym: You also don't like like tuna salad and chicken salad or anything like that.

622
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,868
Rym: You will basically not eat about half the kinds of sandwiches out there.

623
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:01,104
Scott: Yeah.

624
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,249
Scott: Well, you know, what's wrong with that?

625
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:04,370
Rym: But you just said that you like most sandwiches.

626
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,410
Rym: So I feel like we've got some cognitive dissonance here.

627
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,690
Scott: Any sandwich that does not include ingredients I don't like is awesome.

628
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:12,370
Rym: Yeah, that's great.

629
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,007
Rym: Anything I don't like, I like.

630
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:15,669
Scott: Yeah, great.

631
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,866
Rym: I'm at least neutral, too.

632
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:18,888
Rym: All right, straight up.

633
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:20,910
Rym: I like Italian sandwiches.

634
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:33,950
Rym: I like capicola and like spicy ham and I like ham and salami and all those things with a whole bunch of olives, a whole bunch of olive oil, a whole bunch of pepper, a whole bunch of oregano, a ton of mozzarella and provolone cheese.

635
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,445
Rym: I also like it to be at least 16 inches long.

636
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:39,789
Scott: Well, longer is always better.

637
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:42,050
Rym: Well, see, not really.

638
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:49,010
Scott: Well, you know, as much as you can eat and then as you can save some for the next day and if it's longer than that, you cut it up and eat it with all your friends.

639
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,610
Rym: You order a sub at Russo's and you say you want a large.

640
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:52,629
Rym: Oh, my God.

641
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:53,729
Rym: Is that more than I can eat?

642
00:33:54,155 --> 00:33:54,770
Scott: Oh, yeah.

643
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,849
Scott: That's my favorite sandwich right there.

644
00:33:57,478 --> 00:33:57,888
Rym: You know what?

645
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,749
Rym: They're not that good.

646
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,490
Rym: They're only good because they're the best sandwiches down at the beach.

647
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:03,088
Scott: I don't know.

648
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,429
Scott: There's just something about Russo's.

649
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:07,109
Rym: It's just you haven't had a de Bellas in long enough.

650
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,168
Scott: That's true.

651
00:34:08,592 --> 00:34:11,129
Scott: But even at de Bellas, de Bellas is so good.

652
00:34:11,454 --> 00:34:11,728
Rym: I know.

653
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,190
Scott: At de Bellas, I would even get like those no meat sandwiches.

654
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:19,310
Scott: I just get bread, lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, and then some salad dressing.

655
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:20,549
Scott: Oh, that was good.

656
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,469
Rym: The thing is, I've always been a sandwich eater.

657
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,110
Rym: Like from my youngest days, I was always eating fancy sandwiches.

658
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,730
Rym: Like I was always pushing the bar and pushing the envelope.

659
00:34:30,493 --> 00:34:30,841
Scott: And yes.

660
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,149
Rym: Oh, my God.

661
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,549
Rym: Dagwood was kind of I hated that comic.

662
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,330
Rym: I thought it was terrible.

663
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:36,989
Scott: It's still around.

664
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,409
Scott: You hate that comic.

665
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,929
Rym: When I was a kid, I hated it now.

666
00:34:40,192 --> 00:34:40,786
Scott: You like it now?

667
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:41,246
Rym: No.

668
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:44,509
Rym: Now I don't read it because I don't read it either.

669
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:49,389
Rym: But when I was a kid, like I would see that image, the iconic image of him eating a sandwich.

670
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:52,350
Rym: And I modeled my life after that to a large.

671
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:58,389
Rym: My life is basically Dagwood sandwich coupled with irresponsible Captain Tyler's life.

672
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:01,588
Rym: That's not really a joke.

673
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,990
Rym: That's as responsible.

674
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,190
Scott: Kevin Tyler eats sandwiches.

675
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:05,350
Rym: No, not really.

676
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:08,370
Rym: But pretty much my life is modeled 90 percent after him.

677
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:13,770
Rym: But my eating habits are Dagwood's, at least when it comes to sandwiches.

678
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,309
Scott: You don't really do the midnight snack so much.

679
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,429
Rym: I do just by the nature of the life I lead.

680
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,810
Scott: When have you gone down and made a giant sandwich at midnight?

681
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:24,390
Rym: Well, the problem is the midnight.

682
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,250
Rym: All it really is is late at night you eat a sandwich.

683
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,189
Rym: And I've often woke up and wanted to.

684
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:40,870
Rym: The only reason I don't is that because I lead the life I do now, I can't keep enough lunch meat and bread around to make the sandwich at four in the morning, especially since I wake up at four thirty.

685
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,709
Scott: You just make a sandwich and then go to work.

686
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,677
Rym: But at RIT, I would often wake up like I'd get up and make a sandwich and go back to bed.

687
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:49,470
Scott: I don't remember that.

688
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,650
Rym: I would also do this often in high school.

689
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,470
Rym: The thing is, I would not go to sleep first.

690
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:54,870
Rym: I'd just be up on the computer.

691
00:35:55,371 --> 00:35:55,738
Rym: Two a.m.

692
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:56,310
Rym: rolls around.

693
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:57,590
Rym: I make a giant sandwich.

694
00:35:58,171 --> 00:35:58,770
Scott: Oh, that did happen.

695
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,910
Scott: Oh man, pita pit.

696
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,150
Scott: Uh, see the pita.

697
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,410
Scott: Oh, they were open until three a.m Does the pita count as a sandwich?

698
00:36:04,812 --> 00:36:05,930
Rym: No, because then we'll go on forever.

699
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:17,010
Scott: But because if we're talking about sandwich, my favorite sandwich ever is basically go to any real falafel place and just get a falafel pita with everything.

700
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,369
Scott: Don't ask them what goes in there.

701
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:29,529
Scott: Just say you want the lettuce, tomato, onion, the falafels, the dressing, the hot sauce, the French fries, anything that they're willing to put in there, anything they have to put in there, put it all in.

702
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,249
Rym: Well, here's the thing.

703
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:35,784
Rym: Actually, this is the most important advice as a sandwich connoisseur I can ever give to you.

704
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:40,510
Rym: And so many people do not follow this advice and have subpar sandwich experiences.

705
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,630
Rym: Now, I used to not be this way.

706
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:52,970
Rym: It was not until I worked at Dibella's sub shop in Rochester along with Alex that I realized what it is that makes a good sandwich.

707
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,629
Rym: When I realized that, you know, remember Subway had their thing like we have sandwich craftsmen or whatever.

708
00:36:58,531 --> 00:37:00,430
Rym: Subway makes the shittest subs in the world.

709
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,149
Rym: Like, oh, my God.

710
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:04,110
Rym: Subway subs are not even sandwich as far as I'm concerned.

711
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,850
Rym: They're just garbage.

712
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:09,410
Scott: The thing is, you know, you can it is possible to do worse than a Subway sandwich.

713
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,028
Scott: The thing is, they are pretty bad compared to pretty much any sandwich to get at a real place.

714
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:14,829
Scott: They're pretty terrible.

715
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:22,490
Scott: But if you're hungry and you got no choice, because even though it's a bad sandwich, it's still a sandwich.

716
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,830
Scott: That's like, you know, I always use the metaphor of the least smelly poop.

717
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:27,430
Scott: Well, sandwich is like goals.

718
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,590
Scott: This is like the dirtiest.

719
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,310
Scott: A subway is like the dirtiest goal.

720
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:37,368
Rym: See, but at the same time, eating at a subway, especially, you know, the life I lead now because I ate at a subway a few months ago.

721
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,344
Scott: We ate at one when we were at Cinecon.

722
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:41,670
Rym: I'm going to talk.

723
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:45,170
Scott: Oh, when we were at some Leeson James wedding.

724
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:47,869
Rym: Oh, yeah, I guess we did because nothing else was open.

725
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,050
Scott: We didn't eat at a subway at Cinecon.

726
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:49,803
Scott: We ate at a Wendy's.

727
00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:51,189
Rym: I don't remember.

728
00:37:51,370 --> 00:38:01,650
Rym: Anyway, anyway, what it comes down to is that because the sub is reminiscent, like you look at it's kind of like a real sandwiches, like someone pretended to make a real sandwich.

729
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:13,029
Rym: And the brain, when you bite into it, expects more because you're biting into a sandwich because it reminds you of the things that are so much better and it harkens to things that are so much better.

730
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,290
Rym: The experience is less satisfying.

731
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:20,228
Rym: If you had a shitty McDonald's burger, you don't expect anything but a shitty McDonald's burger.

732
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:28,109
Rym: And I will say this now, I would rather eat a quarter powder with cheese or a Big Mac than a subway sub.

733
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,285
Scott: Well, I don't know about that, but actually I've been.

734
00:38:32,305 --> 00:38:33,610
Scott: I'm going to be honest here.

735
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,530
Scott: I hate McDonald's.

736
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,450
Scott: I never go to McDonald's, never buy anything there under any circumstance.

737
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:40,710
Scott: And, you know, even if it was the end of the world, McDonald's is the only food left.

738
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,688
Scott: I probably wouldn't eat there until I was starving with insanity.

739
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:44,968
Rym: I just go there.

740
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,030
Scott: Well, I still had my conscious brain.

741
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:47,729
Scott: I wouldn't eat there.

742
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,129
Rym: I go there every day for breakfast and get like two sandwiches and some hash browns.

743
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:58,130
Scott: You know, as much as I hate the McDonald's breakfast, if I did cave to McDonald's, I might go for the breakfast first because it is a safer bet than the rest.

744
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:08,070
Scott: But I have been curious about McDonald's supposed Angus burger because my main problem with McDonald's is that the burger is not a burger.

745
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,386
Scott: It's like some soy patty meat flavored thing.

746
00:39:11,446 --> 00:39:12,070
Scott: that's not real.

747
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:22,590
Scott: But if the Angus burger is just a piece of Angus beef, put on a hot grill and then put on some bread, even if it's nasty bread, I mean, it is what it is.

748
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,769
Scott: You can't really fake that.

749
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:28,159
Scott: So if that's not really if that is what I think it is, I guess I'd be willing to eat it.

750
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:30,330
Scott: It's, you know, especially if it's pretty cheap.

751
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:33,210
Rym: But anyway, the point this is the real important point here.

752
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,750
Scott: Like a hamburger kind of sandwich?

753
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:42,029
Rym: No, because to get to make this show doable, we're only talking about cold stuff on normal bread.

754
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,630
Scott: We're not going to talk about like a veal parm grinder.

755
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:45,877
Rym: I don't really like.

756
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:47,108
Rym: I prefer chicken parm.

757
00:39:47,872 --> 00:39:49,222
Rym: No, I don't like veal.

758
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,270
Scott: that much veal.

759
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:50,828
Scott: So great.

760
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,050
Scott: It's so tender.

761
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:57,950
Scott: And it's also, you know, it's a lot thinner than the chicken, but it holds together better and it fries up with the crispiness better.

762
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:01,410
Rym: Anyway, see, all you have to do is pound the chicken.

763
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,428
Rym: You get almost the same effect.

764
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:05,449
Scott: Yeah, pounding the chicken house, but hardly any places do that.

765
00:40:06,051 --> 00:40:08,270
Rym: I know a place you want to spend 50 bucks.

766
00:40:08,571 --> 00:40:14,410
Rym: There's a place downtown that makes perhaps the best Italian food I've ever eaten.

767
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,125
Scott: Where is this?

768
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:16,548
Rym: It's downtown.

769
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,250
Rym: All I know is they filmed The Sopranos at it once, apparently.

770
00:40:19,891 --> 00:40:21,029
Scott: I work downtown, you know?

771
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,888
Rym: Yes, I just I don't remember exactly because a car service took me there and a car service took me home.

772
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:29,510
Rym: But oh, my God, was that like the best Italian food I've ever eaten?

773
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,250
Scott: And they make the chicken parm grinder?

774
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,347
Rym: Apparently they pound this chicken for like 15 minutes.

775
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:35,470
Scott: Really?

776
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:36,349
Rym: Oh, my God.

777
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,690
Scott: Wait, so here's what we're going to do.

778
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:38,850
Scott: I got some chicken in the freezer.

779
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,068
Rym: We got to buy a meat pounder.

780
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:40,868
Scott: I'll take it.

781
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:41,789
Scott: I'll go get a hammer.

782
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,909
Scott: You know, meat, you know, you know, tenderizing hammers, the spice hammer.

783
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:45,310
Rym: Yeah.

784
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:45,969
Rym: Wait, forget that.

785
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,249
Rym: We can make a bitchin' meat car.

786
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:48,629
Scott: Oh, shit.

787
00:40:49,273 --> 00:40:49,728
Rym: All right.

788
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:50,229
Rym: All right.

789
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:52,149
Rym: In the interest of time, I got to get to my point.

790
00:40:53,074 --> 00:40:53,506
Rym: Here is it.

791
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:55,670
Rym: I used to be very particular.

792
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,049
Scott: Here it is.

793
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:00,870
Rym: It used to be that back in the day when I wanted a sandwich, I would think real hard.

794
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:02,410
Rym: I'd want a very specific sandwich.

795
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,781
Rym: You'd be like, I'd go to Subway or I'd go to.

796
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:08,769
Rym: actually I much prefer a lot of other places like a Hungry Howie's actually made really good subs.

797
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,490
Rym: And I would be like, all right, I want wheat bread.

798
00:41:12,832 --> 00:41:14,510
Rym: I want ham and turkey.

799
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:18,150
Rym: I want lettuce, tomato, onion, no green peppers.

800
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:20,810
Rym: But I definitely want sweet peppers on half of it.

801
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:23,269
Rym: And I want yellow mustard, like that kind of business.

802
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,690
Rym: And I'd be very particular.

803
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:37,749
Rym: But when I worked at Tabela's and when I started seeing like that, you know, because you always see when a sub place they have like you can make your own sandwich, but then they have the sandwiches that they know how to make already.

804
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:43,350
Rym: You realize that what you want to do is trust the place you're eating at.

805
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,369
Rym: And if they do hope it's a good place, you know, if they do you wrong, never eat there again because it's a shitty place.

806
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:54,090
Rym: And I think almost every Boar's Head deli is like that because they pretty much just make these really generic subs.

807
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,029
Rym: And they're kind of bland.

808
00:41:55,491 --> 00:42:01,350
Rym: A lot of turkey sandwiches they make, you know, it's like that's because fat people think the turkey is lean and they're going to lose weight and whatever.

809
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,870
Rym: They all get like a turkey sandwich, but then they get mayo on it.

810
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:08,430
Scott: You get on a turkey sandwich like one of those Boar's Head places is so dry and tasteless.

811
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:08,946
Rym: Oh, my God.

812
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:11,150
Scott: It's slimy and disgusting processed turkey.

813
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:11,511
Scott: It's like.

814
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:16,410
Scott: I mean, I make a turkey sandwich with like the leftover turkey dark meat from Thanksgiving.

815
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:18,930
Scott: And I realize that's a turkey sandwich.

816
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,426
Rym: This is a term you probably won't know what it is, but the moist maker is where to go with that.

817
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:23,749
Scott: All right.

818
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,210
Scott: You're talking about like, you know, giblets and necks and things.

819
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,850
Rym: No, the moist maker is a reference to a television show that you probably would despise.

820
00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:30,688
Scott: All right.

821
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:35,330
Rym: I only know about this because someone else referenced it and then explained it to me what I didn't know what it was.

822
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,509
Scott: So you despise it also?

823
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,670
Rym: I despise the show, but I respect the moist maker.

824
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:51,150
Rym: Whatever the point is, if you go to a sub place and it looks trustworthy and they have a sandwich and they call it something like the Dagwood or the Godfather order it.

825
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:54,269
Rym: And if you make even one substitution, you are making a mistake.

826
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:55,048
Scott: That's right.

827
00:42:55,270 --> 00:43:00,030
Rym: Because places that are good, like a real deli, they will construct a sandwich.

828
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,609
Rym: They know more about sandwiches than you do.

829
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:02,849
Scott: They make them all day.

830
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,228
Scott: They eat them every day.

831
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:09,168
Rym: I mean, when I worked at the stupid sub shop, they taught us how to make sandwiches for like hours and hours.

832
00:43:09,632 --> 00:43:11,750
Rym: And it was real important, like how to put it together.

833
00:43:12,571 --> 00:43:22,490
Rym: And if you substitute something, you're saying you're confident that you know more about how to make a good tasting sandwich than the person whose job it is to make good tasting sandwich.

834
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,290
Scott: That's like, if you go to Stephen Hawking, you're like, Stephen Hawking, I would like a theory.

835
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:29,810
Rym: I would like a physics theorem, but I wanted to include rabbits.

836
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:30,564
Scott: Yes.

837
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:32,589
Rym: And not stars.

838
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:33,201
Scott: Yeah.

839
00:43:33,631 --> 00:43:34,830
Scott: And no black holes either.

840
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:35,989
Scott: I don't like black holes.

841
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,310
Scott: No black holes in this one.

842
00:43:37,412 --> 00:43:38,349
Scott: I pretend they don't exist.

843
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:43,050
Rym: And I see all these people, like I'll be in line at some deli in the city and there's like a woman in front of them.

844
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,590
Rym: They'll be like, like, she'll be ordering.

845
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:51,968
Rym: She'll like, I want the, uh, the cold cut supreme, but I don't want any mayo on it and I don't want any lettuce.

846
00:43:52,513 --> 00:43:53,989
Rym: And could you not put turkey on it?

847
00:43:54,553 --> 00:43:57,050
Scott: And, uh, I only want olives on it.

848
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,850
Scott: Why didn't you just order something different that didn't have anything you wanted to change?

849
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:08,710
Rym: And also, unless you like have a very specific dislike for something in particular, like you absolutely know that you've never liked olives in anything.

850
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:10,309
Rym: You're never going to like anything with olives in it.

851
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,809
Rym: I think that makes you a horrible person, but that's, that's.

852
00:44:13,072 --> 00:44:13,949
Scott: I don't like olives.

853
00:44:14,491 --> 00:44:17,730
Rym: Well, maybe it's cause I grew up in Detroit, but Greek food is important to me.

854
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:18,206
Rym: Olives.

855
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:20,370
Scott: Greek food is very important to me, just not olives.

856
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,530
Rym: But olives are the basis.

857
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,710
Scott: No, shawarma is the basis.

858
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:27,907
Rym: Shawarma with olives.

859
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:29,490
Scott: Oh, just shawarma?

860
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:30,289
Rym: Oh, with olives.

861
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,410
Scott: Anyway, trust them.

862
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,010
Rym: They know what they're doing.

863
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:34,849
Scott: Some, some Euro.

864
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:47,030
Rym: And I'll tell you what, if you just start, and also don't be particular, just may, if you're going to start making sandwiches at home and you decide you really care about sandwiches, just throw it all together and it's going to be awesome.

865
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:52,889
Rym: If it's not awesome, throw it together a different way and keep throwing it together until you get something transcended.

866
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:59,410
Scott: You know, as Rym said, you know, there are many ingredients that I, I am not, you know, a, a fan of that are on many sandwiches.

867
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,209
Scott: You know, I'm not a fan of the cold roast beef.

868
00:45:02,457 --> 00:45:04,230
Scott: I like the hot roast beefs, but not the cold.

869
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,750
Rym: It's all, here's the, here's the deal with cold roast beef.

870
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,324
Scott: I liked it.

871
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,710
Scott: I liked the Thanksgiving Turkey, but not the shitty processed.

872
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,710
Rym: Scott, I think you've never had a real roast beef sandwich.

873
00:45:11,771 --> 00:45:13,089
Scott: I don't like any, I don't like any hams.

874
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:14,129
Rym: And I'll tell you why.

875
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,999
Rym: If you, have you ever eaten a roast beef sandwich?

876
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:20,489
Rym: that was, but it wasn't hot, but the roast beef was brown.

877
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:21,997
Scott: Brown.

878
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:25,070
Scott: No, it's usually like gray with like crusties.

879
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:25,830
Scott: Oh, that's even worse.

880
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,109
Rym: That's the worst roast beef.

881
00:45:27,414 --> 00:45:27,721
Scott: Uh huh.

882
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,130
Rym: You see real roast beef, cold sandwiches.

883
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,269
Rym: The roast beef is red.

884
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:37,769
Scott: See, when my mom makes roast beef, you know, like hot roast beef just for dinner here, have roast beef.

885
00:45:38,137 --> 00:45:38,549
Scott: It's red.

886
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:41,990
Rym: So perhaps a sandwich out of that.

887
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,229
Rym: And let me with some provolone.

888
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:49,030
Scott: The thing is when that means some horseradish, I don't like horseradish, but when that meat cools down, it doesn't taste so good.

889
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:53,070
Scott: But I like it when it's hot because that was your mom making cook stuff.

890
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,490
Rym: It's different.

891
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,750
Rym: If you, you should someday try a cold cut sandwich.

892
00:45:57,251 --> 00:46:01,750
Rym: That's roast beef, but only if the roast beef is really, really red and not at all dry.

893
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:05,869
Scott: If it tastes like, you know, the rosary that comes out of the oven, it's all good.

894
00:46:06,051 --> 00:46:07,270
Scott: And you have, it's like the roast beef.

895
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,269
Scott: You get it like the deli on the grocery store.

896
00:46:09,553 --> 00:46:10,390
Scott: That shit is nasty.

897
00:46:10,832 --> 00:46:12,990
Rym: Cause it just, you have no taste in sandwiches.

898
00:46:13,132 --> 00:46:14,249
Rym: You have like the, Oh my God.

899
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,649
Scott: But anyway, what I do is I, I agree.

900
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:17,649
Rym: Ham and mustard.

901
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:19,010
Scott: Oh, I like mustard.

902
00:46:19,251 --> 00:46:21,590
Rym: In fact, you know, my favorite sandwich lately is I eat this a lot.

903
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:24,650
Rym: Just get like a baguette and put ham on it.

904
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,750
Rym: You know, just normal ham, like boiled ham and a couple different kinds of mustard.

905
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:29,246
Rym: And that's it.

906
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:30,730
Rym: Oh my God.

907
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,310
Rym: Is that good?

908
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:36,850
Scott: But I agree completely with your idea that you should not change the suggested sandwiches in any way.

909
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:40,430
Scott: When I go to a sandwich place, I look on the giant list of sandwiches.

910
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:44,630
Scott: And if the list of sandwiches is not giant, maybe that's not the greatest sandwich place.

911
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:47,329
Scott: You know, they might be focusing too much on other non sandwich things.

912
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,830
Scott: Sandwiches are not their specialty and they won't be so good.

913
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:59,290
Scott: So you look at the big list of sandwiches and I just look for one, you know, the first one that has no ingredients that I have it to taste for.

914
00:46:59,551 --> 00:46:59,978
Scott: And I get it.

915
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:02,530
Scott: And I just say, I don't, they don't need to change anything.

916
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:03,589
Rym: You know, it's all good.

917
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:12,850
Rym: So pretty much, unless you're going to become one of those people who craft sandwiches and gets really into like sandwich making, just let trust other people to make your sandwiches.

918
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,230
Rym: Let them throw it all together.

919
00:47:14,713 --> 00:47:17,729
Rym: If you see him just like throw something extra in there, don't worry about it.

920
00:47:18,157 --> 00:47:18,530
Scott: It's weird.

921
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,129
Scott: It's like, you know, people seem to have this like fear.

922
00:47:21,531 --> 00:47:28,890
Scott: Like they're more afraid of like something tasting bad or not liking the taste of something or encountering an unfamiliar flavor.

923
00:47:29,311 --> 00:47:32,203
Scott: Then they're afraid of like getting hit by a car.

924
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:35,930
Scott: in some cases, you know, it's like, like, oh my God, there's olives out here.

925
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:36,590
Scott: It's the end of the world.

926
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,610
Scott: I mean, I'm like olives, but if I get olives, I just, I just take them off.

927
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:43,170
Scott: It's not, you know, if I eat one by accident, I go, ah, an olive.

928
00:47:43,675 --> 00:47:45,170
Scott: I don't go, oh my God.

929
00:47:49,172 --> 00:47:49,464
Scott: Exactly.

930
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:59,290
Scott: Some people just like, they have such a negative reaction to like unfamiliar or foods they don't like, you know, and encountering them.

931
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:03,109
Rym: It's just, it's sort of disproportionate, but, uh, I think we should end on this.

932
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:12,029
Rym: Let's each take turns and name three awesome sandwiches all the way through all the way through all the way through how to make our three kind of like three.

933
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,530
Scott: Can I go to the, can I go to the Peters and everything?

934
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:19,164
Rym: Uh, you know what, if you really can't come up, well, that's just, I'll try to come up with them.

935
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:24,590
Rym: See, I think the problem is when it comes to, you know, straight up submarine sandwiches.

936
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,510
Rym: I mean, I can't, I'm not making fun of Scott because, you know, he, he respects the sandwiches.

937
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:33,429
Rym: He likes them, but you're kind of like the person who likes wine, but only likes a couple of wines.

938
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,929
Rym: Doesn't know a lot about it with sandwiches.

939
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:41,370
Scott: Well, it's more like if I liked wine, I only like ports, but I don't like anything else.

940
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:41,534
Scott: Yeah.

941
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:46,078
Rym: I'm the person who tries every kind of wine and like remembers which ones are good and bad.

942
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:51,049
Rym: And like, like, like I really liked the DaVinci Chianti.

943
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:51,829
Scott: Yeah.

944
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:52,290
Scott: All right.

945
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:52,550
Scott: Anyway.

946
00:48:53,032 --> 00:48:53,890
Scott: We can go first.

947
00:48:53,957 --> 00:48:54,090
Rym: Yeah.

948
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,669
Rym: You can expand if you can't come up with the sandwich.

949
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,329
Scott: I could do the sandwich I just ate.

950
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,010
Rym: All right.

951
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:58,265
Rym: Let's go.

952
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,350
Scott: I didn't even know it was on that sandwich.

953
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,689
Scott: Do we have the, let me go get the menu.

954
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,270
Scott: You do it.

955
00:49:02,834 --> 00:49:04,130
Rym: I think that's a valid sandwich.

956
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:05,909
Rym: The one you don't even know what was on it.

957
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:07,309
Rym: All right.

958
00:49:07,713 --> 00:49:08,609
Rym: So, uh, here I go.

959
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,210
Rym: My base pretty much one of my favorite sandwiches ever.

960
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:12,350
Rym: Just take some red roast beef.

961
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:17,910
Rym: This roast beef has to be so incredibly red and you put a ton of it on there.

962
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:24,530
Rym: The sandwich pretty much has to be in terms of meat, two thirds, roast beef, one third, good Turkey.

963
00:49:25,011 --> 00:49:27,970
Rym: And it can't just be like individual slices put out.

964
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:40,210
Rym: You've got to basically have just this crumpled up, placed in mass of meat, like all kind of spread out kind of airy, but in there, a lot of it, you put a little bit of lettuce, some tomatoes, some onions, some hot peppers.

965
00:49:40,412 --> 00:49:42,289
Rym: I'm talking some hot freaking peppers.

966
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:46,529
Rym: You got to have provolone cheese, two layers thick.

967
00:49:48,211 --> 00:49:53,110
Rym: I was whole ton of horseradish and a tiny bit of mayo on fresh bread with Sesame.

968
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,030
Rym: That is possibly one of my favorite sandwiches.

969
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:57,650
Rym: Oh my God.

970
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:58,590
Rym: Cause I didn't eat dinner yet.

971
00:49:58,873 --> 00:49:59,629
Rym: I think I'm going to die.

972
00:50:00,134 --> 00:50:00,870
Rym: I need, Oh my God.

973
00:50:01,052 --> 00:50:01,650
Rym: I need some food.

974
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:02,130
Scott: I hear it.

975
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,530
Rym: Let me tell you that I drooled all over the, uh, the spit filter here.

976
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:06,162
Scott: Good job.

977
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,709
Scott: You want to hear the sandwich I just ate?

978
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,229
Rym: There's drool all over my pop filter.

979
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:10,469
Scott: You want to hear the sandwich I just ate?

980
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:11,597
Scott: I got the menu.

981
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:13,370
Scott: is the menu from the chai boat on the road.

982
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:17,510
Scott: The best sandwich in town, even though it's one town over is the sandwich.

983
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:18,890
Scott: I just ordered an eight for dinner.

984
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,130
Scott: Ready?

985
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,110
Scott: It was a roll circular roll cut in half.

986
00:50:22,278 --> 00:50:22,490
Scott: Right?

987
00:50:22,794 --> 00:50:23,050
Scott: Nice.

988
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:23,850
Scott: Big hardy bread.

989
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:24,509
Scott: They got there.

990
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,930
Scott: It stays completely together.

991
00:50:26,112 --> 00:50:27,130
Scott: You know, you bite through the sandwich.

992
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,930
Scott: It's clean the whole way through on that roll.

993
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:47,249
Scott: They put some, uh, chicken cutlet, a little chicken cutlet, a little sun dried tomatoes spread, not dried tomato, not like tomato sauce from a can, not tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes, spread broccoli, Rob.

994
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:48,189
Scott: Right.

995
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:49,076
Rym: Yeah.

996
00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:54,230
Scott: Inside joke about broccoli rape.

997
00:50:54,516 --> 00:50:55,069
Rym: Oh my God.

998
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,789
Rym: Is broccoli rape like the one of the Martin side jokes, right?

999
00:50:58,151 --> 00:50:59,670
Scott: So we're not talking just broccoli.

1000
00:50:59,872 --> 00:51:01,290
Scott: Like this is prepared broccoli.

1001
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:05,370
Scott: That is a meal unto itself, a side dish unto itself into the sandwich.

1002
00:51:06,532 --> 00:51:07,229
Scott: And provolone.

1003
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:14,642
Scott: And the whole thing's hot, so hot that when I got in my car, it was steaming up the plastic thing that they'd given it to me and, uh, given it to me in.

1004
00:51:15,627 --> 00:51:16,250
Scott: that's a sandwich.

1005
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,670
Scott: Oh, I'm still fed is a sandwich.

1006
00:51:18,401 --> 00:51:18,650
Rym: All right.

1007
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,390
Rym: So, you know, that aside, I really, I mean, I, I like Italian subs.

1008
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:25,129
Rym: They're all kind of the same, but I got to say, I like really simple too.

1009
00:51:26,131 --> 00:51:34,170
Rym: I really enjoy just a whole bunch of boiled ham with a whole bunch of mustard and a whole bunch of onions and lettuce and tomato.

1010
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:38,470
Rym: Just lettuce, tomato, onions, and ham just piled up and a ton of brown mustard.

1011
00:51:41,324 --> 00:51:41,590
Scott: All right.

1012
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:41,830
Scott: Yeah.

1013
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:52,609
Scott: I think, I don't know if I had to, the thing is basically, I really, really like the kosher salamis, the heat, you know, and Hebrew nationals, the one you can get in the store, but you can actually get better than that.

1014
00:51:52,732 --> 00:51:53,449
Scott: It's just not easy.

1015
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,949
Scott: You got to go to special places to get that action.

1016
00:51:56,851 --> 00:52:12,330
Scott: But, uh, if you can get the kosher salamis, you put that on just about any quality bread and, you know, other people like to put the mustard on it, but I don't like the mustard, you know, but putting pretty much, you know, anything else on there is, you know, all right, you can throw some lettuce and cheese on there.

1017
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:16,928
Scott: And while I guess cheese sort of makes it on kosher, but whatever, fuck you, you get some onion on there.

1018
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:18,349
Scott: It's all good.

1019
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:24,130
Scott: But that kosher salami just, it alone can just carry any sandwich into the amazing territories.

1020
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,910
Rym: I think we're done because I got to go eat something or I'm going to die.

1021
00:52:28,451 --> 00:52:37,860
Rym: Uh, this has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1022
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,520
