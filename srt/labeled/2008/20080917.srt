00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,718
Rym: But just in case you're interested.

Rym: I swear to God.

12
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:04,349
Rym: We're never doing this again.

13
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,304
Rym: Gecky guy the rated our version at the request of the convention.

14
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:10,026
Scott: We still have it.

15
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:15,327
Rym: I've got it Actually went through it again, and I I forgot how funny the stupid tree is.

16
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:15,990
Rym: oh my god.

17
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,478
Rym: Like I was reading through the tree now.

18
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:20,729
Rym: I forgot about the gods porn thing.

19
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,619
Scott: GPX is the other manga.

20
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:38,261
Rym: I thought I think one of them's wounded man and one of them is Basically I forgot about the porn and I remember the tree, but I forgot about the true glory of the tree That shot, that's that I would call that piece clarity clarity of vision.

21
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:47,649
Rym: oh My god, yes Gami is truly a master master of something, but yeah the basic master like Van.

22
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:47,930
Scott: Gogh.

23
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:55,100
Rym: I've mentioned this but for those who are unaware if You're going to be at the New York anime festival You should go see our gecky got panel.

24
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:02,370
Rym: for one reason and one reason alone We did the PG rated version at the last New York anime festival because it's a family-friendly con.

25
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:08,228
Rym: People heard tell of what happened at Otakon and what happened at Katsu con.

26
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:11,754
Rym: apparently our gecky got panel is Infamous.

27
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:15,394
Scott: hey, it's infamous with a small crowd But infamous nonetheless.

28
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:29,830
Rym: infamous to the point at least that the convention asked us to do the version We did at Otakon to which I said even though we did this panel already at the convention last time to which I said hell No So we're doing what we did at Katsu con.

29
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,490
Rym: We were doing the rated our version not the rated Gerald version

30
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:36,233
Scott: Oh Gerald

31
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:49,200
Rym: and also as a special treat because I had to be in the city anyway, I Will be doing possibly with Emily our know your creators panel on Sunday at like 245 without Scott because he didn't want to come on Sunday and

32
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,730
Scott: it's not worth it for me to go to the city on Sunday to Do a panel and go home.

33
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,216
Scott: Yes But basically I got stuff to do.

34
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:59,927
Rym: I needed a day in the city to go like by skis for the winter and all this Business and it was basically the perfect day to do it.

35
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:02,090
Rym: So I've got to be in the city.

36
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:03,477
Rym: Anyway, I'm just gonna swing by.

37
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,950
Rym: me and Emily are gonna do this panel and get right back on our way.

38
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:10,009
Rym: So for those of you who don't know what Emily looks like it might be your chance to see her.

39
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,625
Scott: Yeah, you know the panel that I came up with I'm not even doing.

40
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:14,590
Rym: yeah, that's fine.

41
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,399
Rym: We learned a lot from doing the panel at Otakon.

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,430
Rym: We learned that we had far too many creators.

43
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,881
Scott: Yeah, well, that's cuz I we tried to eat.

44
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:25,166
Scott: that came up with that great stick But to pull off the stick required too many creators.

45
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,332
Scott: Yes Whatever.

46
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:28,556
Rym: so, uh, what do you got?

47
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:32,010
Rym: the news being an anime show haven't done one of these in a while.

48
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:40,274
Scott: It's not really big anime news Great, but there is a video game news Involving anime.

49
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:41,277
Rym: Uh-huh.

50
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:42,060
Scott: Is it y'all?

51
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,380
Scott: you're all.

52
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:44,366
Rym: you're all skeptical and I am all skeptical.

53
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:45,490
Scott: What are you skeptical of?

54
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,843
Rym: I'm skeptical that it's really usefully related to anime manga or comics.

55
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,570
Scott: Oh, it's incredibly usefully related.

56
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,010
Scott: You see who of all the video game companies in the universe is awesome right now Capcom Capcom.

57
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,174
Scott: And you know Capcom.

58
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:05,190
Scott: they like to do their games of Capcom verse, you know, the fighting games have come first Marvel Comics.

59
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:05,591
Rym: I'll be.

60
00:04:05,671 --> 00:04:06,373
Rym: I'll be honest.

61
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:08,720
Rym: Some people might not like me anymore.

62
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,526
Rym: I never liked those games.

63
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,870
Rym: I don't think they're good games.

64
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:14,095
Scott: I like them in a way.

65
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:16,201
Rym: No, I like part of what like.

66
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,947
Rym: I like what they are and what they stand for.

67
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,461
Rym: playing them Not so fun for me.

68
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:21,769
Scott: it depends on which one.

69
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,327
Rym: All right, it's fun to play them against people who suck at them, but that's about it.

70
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,550
Scott: Yes I know people are just too good.

71
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:29,094
Scott: Any fighting.

72
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:31,003
Rym: I know just enough to where.

73
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:34,300
Rym: if you're not good at that game I'm going to fucking destroy you.

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,170
Rym: but if you are good at that game, you will destroy me.

75
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,410
Scott: That's pretty much how it is with any fighting game.

76
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,250
Scott: What fighting game is are you not that like that?

77
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:51,065
Rym: but the level in this game like the point like yet when you get to the point and it doesn't take much to get that 1% better than normal people when you realize the game is all about those combo.

78
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:54,382
Scott: Anyway, yeah, okay I don't see how it's any different than any other fighting in.

79
00:04:54,422 --> 00:05:00,503
Rym: the point is the point is People who don't know anything about Soul Calibur 2 will beat anyone.

80
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:04,697
Rym: but a god about a third of the time That doesn't happen to Marvel vs.

81
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,122
Rym: Capcom for example.

82
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,350
Scott: Anyway, they're making this one.

83
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,855
Scott: It's been out of news for a while.

84
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:13,910
Scott: people have known they're making Tatsunoko verse Capcom, right?

85
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:17,882
Scott: Now, I don't know if people realize what Tatsunoko is.

86
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:19,548
Scott: Do you know what Tatsunoko is?

87
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:20,290
Scott: I have no idea.

88
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:21,356
Scott: You really don't know?

89
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:21,638
Scott: No.

90
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,490
Scott: It's very anime appropriate.

91
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:35,579
Scott: Tatsunoko is basically an anime company and they I Don't know if they're like a. they're a production company apparently Okay and they're responsible for many.

92
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,989
Scott: many things fall under the banner of Tatsunoko like Well Speed Racer.

93
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:43,523
Rym: So Speed Racer is gonna be fighting in this.

94
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:48,203
Rym: quite possibly That that sounds a little more lame than it does.

95
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:48,605
Rym: Awesome.

96
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:53,829
Scott: Hurricane Palomar Lots of crazy weird giant robot things.

97
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,230
Rym: So is this gonna be a bunch of crazy weird giant robot thing fighting game and that's it.

98
00:05:58,852 --> 00:05:59,132
Scott: I think.

99
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,336
Scott: gotcha man will be in there.

100
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,840
Rym: Maybe so far.

101
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,702
Rym: This isn't exciting.

102
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:05,529
Scott: It's all sorts of samurai pizza cats.

103
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:13,422
Scott: Aha, take a man blade Yeah, whatever it's lots of stuff that you don't care about apparently but money.

104
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:20,330
Scott: many other anime fans out there will care about many Of these characters that will now be in a top-class fighting game.

105
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:20,973
Rym: I don't know.

106
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:21,274
Rym: I'm just.

107
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,330
Rym: I don't think that the game is gonna do very well in the US.

108
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:26,647
Scott: Well, I don't think it's coming out in the US.

109
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,512
Scott: well There it.

110
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:32,867
Scott: the news is is that the two news is that just happened about this game.

111
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:33,770
Scott: right is number one.

112
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:38,650
Scott: You know, this game was originally just gonna be like an arcade and ps3 game or whatever, right?

113
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:47,329
Scott: but now it's gonna be a Wii game and Recently people have cracked the Wii to play some backups and such.

114
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:52,510
Scott: So I can see some bootleg importing torrenting of this game going on in the US.

115
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,329
Rym: I foresee playing it at anime cons because I'm not gonna bother trying to get it.

116
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:02,093
Scott: I might try to do something like that, but they added a Character to the game.

117
00:07:02,374 --> 00:07:08,132
Scott: at least the Wii version is gonna have characters that the other versions don't have which is sort of crazy Uh-huh.

118
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:09,336
Rym: Can I fight with my me?

119
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:10,540
Scott: I don't know.

120
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,302
Scott: I don't know.

121
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:12,305
Scott: I don't think so.

122
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:13,670
Scott: I highly doubt it's not that kind of game.

123
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:26,270
Scott: They're gonna add Hakushan Daimo Who is like this sneezing genie character from something I never heard of but when I saw him I was like wow That is freaking old-school and obscure.

124
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:33,310
Scott: This is definitely a game for the fanboys And if you are the fanboy you are you should be pretty excited.

125
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:38,289
Rym: But just in case no one has seen this I mean it was in our forum and people were talking about it.

126
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:49,126
Rym: But Emily pointed out to us a while ago that there is in fact a new anime coming and of course There's always new anime coming but it's so rare that there's a new show that I'm excited about.

127
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,413
Rym: I mean every season There's like one show.

128
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:57,130
Rym: I'm kind of excited about but I mean what I let's see bacchanal slayers revolution and this.

129
00:07:57,673 --> 00:08:07,915
Scott: But this show looks so incredibly bad You know, it's really weird though is if you actually count the number of shows like on Japanese TV There's more than ever.

130
00:08:07,975 --> 00:08:12,990
Scott: there's like 40 something show anime on Japanese TV right now or something like this.

131
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:23,750
Rym: I mean, it's not really an indictment of Japanese anime because I'm equally pessimistic about American television and there's about all entertainment in all mediums from all countries.

132
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,410
Rym: But anyway, the show looks incredibly awesome and I really want to make sure everyone is ready for it to come.

133
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:36,623
Rym: I expect the fan subs to be well worth it, but Michiko and Hachin has a lot of high-powered people involved.

134
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:37,446
Rym: Of course for one.

135
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:40,537
Rym: It's being produced by Watanabe aka.

136
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:41,018
Rym: Mr.

137
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:52,250
Rym: Cowboy Bebop and it's basically set in like Alternate semi future Brazil and it's about this hard-ass woman and this little girl shooting people.

138
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:58,561
Rym: It looks like a buddy comedy that's really gritty and cool and I Really get the cowboy bebop samurai.

139
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,949
Rym: Champloo kind of vibe from it.

140
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:06,648
Rym: You know, that might be kind of obvious, but it's also man globe is involved, you know, ergo proxy and such.

141
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:12,432
Rym: so Watch this trailer and if you're not excited about this, I guess you just don't like the kind of anime I like.

142
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,956
Scott: I guess you don't like anime.

143
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:14,518
Scott: I don't know.

144
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,210
Scott: But yeah, it's you know the show from the trailer.

145
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:20,677
Scott: I can't really draw that much out of it.

146
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:27,136
Scott: But what I can tell is definitely this is not another moe show It's not a robot show.

147
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:32,670
Scott: It's definitely one of those anime that's not in a typical anime genre.

148
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,040
Scott: Therefore the chances of it being good are significantly higher.

149
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,030
Rym: Well one the trailer looked actually really really good and two it's coming soon.

150
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,616
Rym: It's actually coming in October.

151
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:51,510
Scott: Yeah, they usually you don't find out about anime that far in advance You know, they usually keep everything under wraps until the show's definitely gonna be on TV or something like that.

152
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:59,675
Scott: You know, they don't like to say anything and then have to go back on it Later, like, you know a lot of companies in the US do where they say something and they go oops No, we didn't mean that.

153
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,410
Scott: they just you know, keep their mouths shut and they only say any something if it's a sure deal.

154
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:11,275
Rym: So if nothing else when the show actually comes out you can bet that we will be reviewing it or at least previewing it Pretty quickly.

155
00:10:11,335 --> 00:10:13,322
Scott: because isn't that sort of a weird thing though?

156
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:21,688
Scott: It's like, you know anime is a medium, you know It's animation for Japan and Japan, you know people from Japan can animate anything anything that can be animated.

157
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:23,518
Scott: they can animate it Right yet.

158
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:25,230
Scott: There are certain genres.

159
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:34,217
Scott: They happen to animate lots and lots of TV shows movies and OAVs in those genres such as magical girl, you know Giant robot etc.

160
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:34,939
Rym: than anything.

161
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:38,450
Rym: I mean in America you can film or animate or do whatever to anything you want.

162
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:45,450
Rym: But yet they just make a lot of like buddy cop shows Procedural cop shows and it was reality shows.

163
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:53,332
Scott: I know the thing is is that in Japan it seems like not in Japan, but in anime it seems like Good.

164
00:10:53,452 --> 00:11:01,057
Scott: good shows are always the ones that are not in one of those default genre, you know It seems like the same way the US.

165
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:02,703
Rym: anytime a show like breaks the mold.

166
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:03,888
Rym: It's usually the great show.

167
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:06,488
Scott: So When you think about that, right?

168
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:08,710
Scott: Why would anyone?

169
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,401
Scott: Not well, you should just break the mold every time.

170
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,270
Scott: part of the reason you're not breaking the mold Why bother you got you're not doing something?

171
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:22,170
Rym: Yes It's pretty simple because a lot of shows try to break the mold and very few of them succeed.

172
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:24,200
Scott: And it's not hard to break the mold.

173
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:26,010
Scott: Don't make a magical girl.

174
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:28,490
Scott: I was trying to break the mold.

175
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:30,210
Scott: I made a magical girl show accident.

176
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:30,753
Scott: I shit.

177
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:36,398
Rym: breaking the mold is a huge risk because most shows that break the mold Fail miserably and wallow in obscurity.

178
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:42,240
Rym: and the rare one show that broke the mold and was good Does way better than a show that didn't break the mold.

179
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,890
Rym: but a show that doesn't break the mold is it pretty much?

180
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,375
Rym: Guaranteed moneymaker.

181
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:49,390
Rym: It'll make enough money to pay everyone involved and have a tidy profit.

182
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:52,109
Rym: You're not gonna make some revolutionary new art?

183
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:52,672
Scott: I don't know.

184
00:11:52,692 --> 00:12:01,650
Scott: look I look right now and it seems like every mold breaking show is good at least good You know and every non bold breaking show is just a not so much.

185
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:06,197
Scott: That's what I'm seeing at least in the world of anime one I disagree But to like.

186
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:13,352
Rym: if you look at American TV That's pretty much clearly the case and you can see all the different shows that are like yeah check out our show It's edgy.

187
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:13,975
Rym: It's weird.

188
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,723
Rym: This show is not like other shows.

189
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,309
Rym: We're trying real hard here.

190
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:23,830
Scott: Well releasing a hundred moe shows seems to have not done the anime industry very well in America.

191
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:25,779
Rym: Hey, I'll bet those shows made enough money.

192
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,325
Scott: I don't know about that.

193
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:28,169
Scott: I don't know.

194
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:39,740
Rym: So before we tread into these very dangerous waters we do have as always things of the day.

195
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:48,339
Rym: This might be a cop-out, but I guess now don't know because the phrase here I know what you're doing the phrase here is quoted for truth.

196
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,069
Rym: All right Because this has been on my mind a lot after we went to PAX.

197
00:12:52,109 --> 00:13:07,179
Rym: but anime news Nina in case you haven't heard me say this enough exceeds all expectations and the anime news network gets mad points for using a somewhat edgy poignant and I guess awesome webcomic as their official webcomic.

198
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:21,403
Scott: I mean usually when you have a comic that is created to sponsor something or is in Association with your company or a mark a comic comics used for marketing purposes are typically really really really lame Every pretty much.

199
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:27,420
Scott: it's really hard to find a comic that is associated with a business or is an ad that isn't lame.

200
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:37,980
Rym: And usually it's because they can't really be witty and biting and edgy and dark And they can't really take snipes at what is the truth because then they'll get in trouble and turn people away.

201
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:45,780
Rym: But anime news Nina has consistently Bait into people who deserve biting into and it is witty and it is gray.

202
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,513
Scott: It's like if the newspaper was all about anime.

203
00:13:48,573 --> 00:14:05,180
Rym: This would be the political cartoon anime news named Nina quoted for truth and Basically this animators Nina the second most recent one Kind of in a roundabout way encapsulates what it is I think is wrong with American anime cons in a big way.

204
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:09,460
Scott: I agree with it a hundred million percent and it doesn't even beat around the bush.

205
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,365
Scott: It's like there's no Bush to beat around.

206
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:12,488
Rym: It's like why?

207
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:14,353
Rym: because what what do you mean?

208
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:14,774
Rym: Why?

209
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,944
Rym: because we're fucked the end Pretty much.

210
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:24,514
Rym: Yeah, and the the faces on the people lined up are brilliant Mmm, anyway, that's all I have to say.

211
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:34,904
Rym: I'm not even gonna spoil The comics about so we can discuss it I know because I want to get into the dangerous waters that we are treading very rather go into dangerous waters and discuss a good Topic.

212
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:36,660
Rym: Yes, that's just the kind of man You know what?

213
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,600
Rym: It's the gecky guy ideal to walk forward on my own true feet to be what it is that a man is.

214
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:49,787
Scott: When I was a pack without all the rape Ram, you know, we've had lots of good ideas for you know Merch the company should make that they never made.

215
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:55,620
Rym: Ah, yes such as Metroid umbrella, you know, oh my god I would buy a metro to umbrella.

216
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:03,480
Scott: Imagine for a minute a clear umbrella clear plastic with three red balls inside and some white spikes hanging down in the middle.

217
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:05,806
Scott: That's a wicked cool umbrella right there.

218
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:06,788
Scott: that is Nintendo.

219
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:07,590
Scott: make that umbrella.

220
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:11,440
Rym: No that umbrella it two words social currency.

221
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,724
Rym: Yeah, that's like a thousand dollar bill.

222
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:21,701
Scott: All right, so, you know, there aren't really like Metroid merches like there should be especially not cute ones.

223
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:30,168
Scott: I mean you can get Samus action figures I guess but that's about it and I've always wanted like a little plush Metroid like a little one.

224
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:38,236
Scott: That's cute like You know or maybe like a Metroid hat sort of like those You know the head grabs.

225
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:41,829
Scott: Yeah, the head crab hats that valve makes, you know, something like that only a Metroid.

226
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:51,770
Scott: well When I was at PAX I saw someone wearing a Metroid hat Karen a Metroid plushie and This shit looked like it was official real-deal merch.

227
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:53,847
Scott: So I was gonna ask them where the hell they got it.

228
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:56,369
Rym: Did the guy just make it himself or why it was a girl?

229
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:04,702
Scott: But and I failed to ask them where they got it because they sort of you know was in a crowd I couldn't get close to him and then on the way out I was almost close to them, but then I couldn't get.

230
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:05,868
Scott: and then it was you know, forget it.

231
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:11,790
Scott: So I later on I searched for Metroid hat because I think I thought it was real merch, right?

232
00:16:11,892 --> 00:16:12,486
Scott: I could find it.

233
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:15,137
Scott: It was not real merch.

234
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,448
Scott: They made it and in fact, there is a website Metroid hat calm.

235
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:27,790
Scott: And Metroid hat calm is that person's website and on that person's website is a Metroid plushie tutorial.

236
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,579
Scott: That's how come I found their website.

237
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,086
Rym: Are you gonna make the Metroid hat?

238
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:31,950
Scott: I don't know.

239
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,458
Scott: Maybe I'll try to make the Metroid plushie.

240
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:35,650
Scott: I mean I made a stuffed alligator when I was in middle school.

241
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,274
Scott: Why couldn't I make?

242
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,884
Rym: I miss it was not that hard granted.

243
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:38,890
Rym: We don't have a sewing machine.

244
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,550
Scott: No, if I had a sewing machine to be 10,000 times easier, but I want to really cheap.

245
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:48,930
Rym: Yeah If I buy one to go to the craft store I could probably make stupid audition and auditions more expensive than a cheap sewing machine.

246
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:53,088
Scott: I could probably do it if I wanted to but I've got some programming things to do first.

247
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,790
Rym: Regardless, you could get one of those geeky sewing machines that you can program.

248
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,681
Scott: Yeah to bring it back to the anime and the manga right?

249
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:07,770
Scott: Not only does this a Metroid hat calm Of this girl from you know, Western Canada who was at PAX, right?

250
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:16,609
Scott: Not only does her website have the Metroid plushie tutorial It also has the Nintendo power Metroid Prime comic that was in Metroid Prime.

251
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:26,644
Scott: it has scans lations of the Japanese Metroid manga and it has Broken a mother 3 fan comic among some other things on here.

252
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:35,150
Scott: So if you like Metroid hats mother 3 Metroid comics anything along these lines want to make a Metroid plushie?

253
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:37,575
Rym: You had me at Metroid.

254
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:38,016
Scott: Yeah, I know.

255
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:43,150
Scott: check any of this other stuff, you know cute pictures of Metroids wearing hats that aren't Metroids.

256
00:17:43,774 --> 00:17:45,143
Scott: You know, this is a website.

257
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:47,032
Scott: You should probably go to Alright.

258
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:49,899
Rym: Alright, but we really shouldn't beat around the bush anymore.

259
00:17:49,940 --> 00:18:01,150
Rym: because you see we realize that of all the anime podcasters out there that we know I Believe that we have more I don't know testicular fortitude than all of them combined.

260
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:06,026
Scott: Well, I'm not sure that none of them have gone in these waters before.

261
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:07,410
Rym: they've gone in similar waters.

262
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:17,630
Rym: I will give them that because reviews of certain things are very very intimidating to do crystal triangle and They have other people like anime world order.

263
00:18:17,951 --> 00:18:21,986
Rym: They've reviewed shows that I am still kind of afraid to go near.

264
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:26,118
Rym: but at the same time No one has touched this show with a.

265
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,470
Scott: well, I mean someone might have touched the show, but I haven't heard it.

266
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,070
Rym: We did once before I think we did a show that was basically you're all stupid if you don't like this show.

267
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:37,040
Scott: I. now we're doing that show again times 10.

268
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,308
Rym: You see a long long time ago.

269
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:52,870
Rym: We had a poll We're like, alright, it's been a while I mean we did a final thoughts episode about you know like one or two anime that we didn't do it for a long time and We did a poll and we asked people what shows they like final thoughts about and you know people voted for the obvious ones.

270
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,653
Rym: They wanted a lane.

271
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:54,556
Rym: They want to try gun.

272
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:55,379
Rym: They wanted Ava.

273
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,327
Scott: I haven't seen Lane in a million years.

274
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,013
Rym: Oh my god You know what?

275
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:00,718
Rym: I watch Lane in high school.

276
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:01,621
Rym: I haven't seen it since.

277
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:04,149
Scott: I saw it early at RIT way.

278
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:05,716
Scott: early I watched the DVD box set.

279
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:06,762
Scott: It was a good show.

280
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:10,538
Rym: Anyway, yeah, keep going but We were gonna do.

281
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:26,401
Rym: a final thoughts on Shinseki Evangelion one of the now This is where the shit from all you people out there begins because what I'm about to say is a somewhat controversial statement one of the best Freaking anime ever created.

282
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:27,425
Rym: Oh, no Rym.

283
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:27,927
Scott: You're wrong.

284
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:28,490
Scott: You're wrong.

285
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:34,750
Scott: Oh, oh, it is among the greatest television shows in the history of the universe.

286
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:35,414
Rym: And you know what?

287
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:39,675
Rym: when we and I say among I don't think I mean top hundred I mean like top five.

288
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:41,181
Scott: now something like that.

289
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:52,018
Rym: a month ago as recently as a month ago I would have said yeah, it's in the top 50 at least probably in the top 15, but you know Hindsight blah blah blah.

290
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,910
Rym: I watched the show a bunch of time was I was younger?

291
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,655
Scott: This is a show.

292
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:57,050
Scott: I watched this show on VHS alone.

293
00:19:57,732 --> 00:20:00,680
Scott: Then I watched the movies, you know alone actually.

294
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,530
Scott: then I watched it on VHS and a marathon.

295
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:16,262
Scott: It's not not too long after that the same year In fact like within months and then I didn't watch the show for one two three Possibly six or seven years.

296
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:17,247
Scott: I think seven years.

297
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:19,740
Rym: meanwhile I be maybe eight years.

298
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,630
Rym: I was into anime when I was in high school.

299
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:23,255
Rym: I got a fan.

300
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:28,450
Scott: so the show is more than seven or eight years old of air and a pure heart for you.

301
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:32,056
Rym: the movie the Movie the aim.

302
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:35,530
Scott: Well, they're not gonna confuse you by talking about all the different.

303
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:36,832
Rym: I'll get it.

304
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:38,899
Rym: I'll explain what we're gonna talk about in a minute.

305
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,576
Rym: Yeah, don't worry the the AT field aka the spoiler line We're not there yet.

306
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:44,824
Rym: We're getting close, but we're not there yet.

307
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:45,810
Rym: We're not gonna spoil anything.

308
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,638
Rym: I saw the movie before.

309
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:53,432
Rym: I knew there was a show and all I want to say is that I showed it to a Bunch of people.

310
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,237
Rym: we watched it it ended.

311
00:20:55,578 --> 00:21:01,683
Rym: everyone turned to me and said and I quote with one voice Rym What the fuck did you just show to us?

312
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:10,754
Scott: Seriously, dude We had to know what happened and it ended and we know it as soon you got to like that when you got to like Pure heart for you.

313
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:12,605
Scott: You thought you were gonna find out what happened.

314
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,510
Rym: Yes, and you know what?

315
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:13,974
Scott: How did you?

316
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:15,209
Scott: you didn't even know what happened before?

317
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:17,241
Scott: Know what the resolution would be.

318
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,737
Scott: even if there was a resolution I didn't know what was being resolved.

319
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:26,670
Rym: the worst part about that movie is that I found out Exactly what happened and that was worse than not knowing anyway.

320
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:29,641
Rym: Anyway, we are not talking about the Ava movies.

321
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:31,166
Rym: That is I'm not even gonna get into that.

322
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:34,100
Rym: We're Basically what we were doing here.

323
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:46,730
Rym: now, this is final thoughts Evangelion, so once we say the word Spoilers spoilers spoilers and normally a lot of people when they don't care about a show say yeah I don't care just spoil the show for me.

324
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:53,100
Rym: In fact when it came to shoujo kakamei Utena multiple people had asked me over the years to spoil the show and I refused to know.

325
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:58,930
Rym: and when Emily finally saw the show all The way through she thanked me for not spoiling it.

326
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:06,264
Rym: And all I want to say is that if you have not seen Neon Genesis Evangelion all the way through do not listen any further.

327
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:21,129
Scott: This show is so Incredibly worth your watching and if you're one of those people out there I know you exist right who has not watched the whole show seriously given watched every single episode in order with your full attention.

328
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:27,415
Scott: or Maybe you've never watched any of it and you have all the sorts of Misgivings about it.

329
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:33,834
Rym: or if you saw it while you were a teenager or a young 20-something Watch it again.

330
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,581
Scott: when you're older get the DVD box set.

331
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,770
Scott: the platinum DVD box like 30 box is stupidly cheap.

332
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:58,232
Scott: It comes with the entire TV series and four director's cut versions of episodes 21 through 24, I think right Watch the whole thing Again, so or for the first time and I don't care if you're one of those people who's like, I don't like robots Is it?

333
00:22:58,453 --> 00:22:59,175
Scott: I don't give a shit.

334
00:22:59,656 --> 00:23:00,058
Scott: watch it.

335
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:07,664
Rym: even if you hated Ava you listen to us you watch it again You watch it four more times and you still hate it in the end.

336
00:23:07,684 --> 00:23:08,487
Rym: That's fine.

337
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:10,658
Scott: It's kind of like You're just a retard.

338
00:23:10,678 --> 00:23:11,849
Rym: Yeah, but you can you can.

339
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:31,897
Rym: you can say I do not like Citizen Kane and While a lot of people will say wow, you have some bad taste in movies at the same time you they can at least say but it is your opinion as long as you admit that citizen Kane is an important movie a Well-constructed movie an amazing movie.

340
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:38,415
Scott: I mean like you might look at say I don't know the Sistine Chapel and say, you know I'm not really feeling anything.

341
00:23:38,455 --> 00:23:42,049
Scott: I'm just looking at it and I got no feelings coming in, you know, that's fine.

342
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:47,988
Scott: You know, I don't like different different, you know different strokes and folks and all that business, right?

343
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:52,890
Rym: But All that made me think of was the opening scene of the stupid Ava movie.

344
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,997
Scott: Well, maybe think of different strokes the TV show.

345
00:23:55,017 --> 00:24:03,666
Rym: Well one stroke for some folk right all over some other folk To which my mom said, why do you why don't need this business?

346
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:04,910
Scott: I keep that business out of here.

347
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:09,869
Scott: But if you look at you can't say it's this teen chapel sex.

348
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:10,270
Scott: no It's.

349
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:13,721
Scott: it's pretty much like the best ever and if you don't like it, you're you're dumb.

350
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:21,474
Rym: Yes, but basically this is final thoughts Evangelion, but I'm gonna have to clarify that because there is a lot to Evangelion.

351
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,870
Scott: so you could probably just sit here and talk all night and not run out of things to say.

352
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,115
Scott: So we're basically gonna.

353
00:24:26,176 --> 00:24:32,267
Scott: it's it's the one hour of thoughts of how to even yes So it is going to be however a final thoughts.

354
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:39,758
Rym: episode Nothing is sacred spoilers all over the place, but I Want to say that this episode is almost more.

355
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,310
Rym: I would almost want to call it in defense of the event.

356
00:24:43,451 --> 00:24:44,856
Scott: I don't think it needs defense.

357
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:45,699
Scott: Why would you need to?

358
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,370
Scott: it's like well who needs to defend citizen Kane?

359
00:24:48,830 --> 00:25:00,586
Rym: Well, the reason it needs to be defended is because unlike citizen Kane Imagine if you went online and there were entire websites dedicated to people ranting about how much citizen Kane sucks.

360
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:13,669
Rym: I Search right now you search for that because I see that with Ava a lot of otherwise intelligent people will come up to me And try to tell me that Ava is a terrible show and yet I've never heard a well-reasoned.

361
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:17,550
Scott: The top result for hate citizen Kane right is checked.

362
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,433
Scott: Here's a quote from it.

363
00:25:18,854 --> 00:25:25,092
Scott: despite the fact that I can respect and appreciate its significance cinematic history based solely on entertainment value I hate citizen Kane.

364
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:41,308
Rym: Oh, that is exactly what opinion you were allowed to have exactly but I Feel like the reason we don't need to defend Evangelion like Scott said is because we're like one of the lessons I've learned from both gecky guy and hockey The best defense is a strong offense.

365
00:25:41,368 --> 00:25:47,150
Scott: Yes We've already begun to make fun of the people who hate Evangelion and I can tell you we will not stop doing so.

366
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,715
Scott: So what eventually I mean?

367
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:54,509
Scott: before my most recent viewing I might have said yeah, you know I know why people don't like the show.

368
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,070
Scott: It's sort of weird and tries to be existential and could be interpreted as pretentious.

369
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:04,339
Scott: People don't like the heavy metaphor action I believe when we watch big o2.

370
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,347
Rym: I said the words in the big o2.

371
00:26:06,388 --> 00:26:09,590
Rym: final thoughts This show did the end of Ava better than Ava and you know what?

372
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,417
Rym: I retract that statement a hundred percent.

373
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,450
Rym: the final two episodes of Ava are brilliant.

374
00:26:15,132 --> 00:26:24,564
Scott: Yeah, if you really and I watch Ava again, and now I say no no, no, no longer Am I gonna say I understand why people don't like the end of this?

375
00:26:25,105 --> 00:26:27,814
Scott: Well, I guess I do understand Your.

376
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:30,241
Scott: your brain is broken you're wrong you're an idiot.

377
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,053
Scott: but basically yeah, yeah, you don't have no taste You have no tongue.

378
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:41,928
Rym: what this show is what we're going to do very specifically is Tell you everything we think even though we've already killed like a whole bunch of time not saying anything.

379
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:42,410
Scott: That's fine.

380
00:26:42,832 --> 00:26:43,815
Rym: Well, because this is it's.

381
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,141
Rym: this is one of those difficult.

382
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:46,928
Rym: We are in very dangerous waters here.

383
00:26:46,968 --> 00:26:48,652
Rym: We are treading Deeper.

384
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:52,206
Scott: that's okay because we brought a whole boatload of ammo.

385
00:26:52,226 --> 00:26:54,555
Rym: Oh my god Listen to him.

386
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:56,762
Rym: reason that's right or in a t-field.

387
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:59,130
Scott: No, they'll listen to reason, you know, what's great?

388
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:01,176
Rym: Oh, here's my one fanboy moment.

389
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:04,468
Rym: reason wouldn't have done shit to even Ava zero zero.

390
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:05,070
Scott: Not at all.

391
00:27:08,972 --> 00:27:24,029
Rym: But what we're doing is we're talking about the show Shin Seiki Evangelion neon Genesis Evangelion episodes 1 through 26 as you would see them if you buy the platinum Collection pretty much as they were seen by people on TV.

392
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,722
Rym: and We're not going to talk about anything.

393
00:27:27,762 --> 00:27:37,949
Rym: That is not in TV in Japan yes, and the reason I say that is because There's a lot you can say about Evangelion that is not able to be determined from the show.

394
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:47,604
Rym: You could only know these things if you saw the movies books listen to interviews with Anno and all these things really color the show.

395
00:27:47,644 --> 00:27:48,727
Rym: and we're not talking about that.

396
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:52,518
Rym: we could do a whole Show on like interpretations of Ava.

397
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,704
Rym: We're not talking about how to interpret Ava.

398
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:56,730
Rym: We were talking about what is in Ava.

399
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:02,290
Rym: So thus at this point the spirit vlogging news is going right through that spoiler line.

400
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:14,490
Rym: once again I beseech you if you have not seen Evangelion all the way through or you don't remember what it's about or if you watched it and you kind of liked it But you haven't watched it in a long time.

401
00:28:14,751 --> 00:28:16,378
Rym: Do not listen any further.

402
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:19,229
Rym: come back after you have watched Ava all the way through.

403
00:28:19,672 --> 00:28:28,230
Rym: Yeah, so that said Ava is a show about the end of the world and that might sound like a very trite thing to say.

404
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,290
Rym: I mean, yeah, it was the show where they kill everyone at the end.

405
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,972
Rym: They're not kidding.

406
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:32,516
Rym: a lot of shows about the end of the world.

407
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:38,914
Scott: think about how many right anime manga especially but sci-fi Things in general, right?

408
00:28:38,954 --> 00:28:50,285
Scott: Maybe they're post-apocalyptic and the world already ended and now it's the few people left over Who are still you know struggling to survive and you know make their way in a doomed land.

409
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:58,850
Scott: or maybe it's one of those shows Where okay, there's something horrible attacking and if the good guys lose it will be the end of the world.

410
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:05,496
Scott: But you know, it's just mostly a big fighting show sort of like I don't know Project blue cheeky usos.

411
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:10,270
Scott: Yeah, or something like that, right or it could be one of those shows.

412
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,070
Rym: Well, there's like the last question, you know science fiction that deals with these topics.

413
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,490
Rym: But Ava what it does it does something that has been done before.

414
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:25,990
Rym: it's not like Ava is the only work of fiction to ever do this, but the gravity of the situation and the gravity of what I mean.

415
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:33,084
Rym: It is the end of the world and the gravity is presented to you in Such stark relief in this show.

416
00:29:33,164 --> 00:29:49,030
Scott: it is done handled So well, well because what most of those other shows do especially the ones that are you know have the risk of end-of-world Situation is it's basically if something happens that barely anyone knows is happening Then the world will end pretty much near instantly.

417
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,488
Scott: Evangelion is.

418
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,242
Scott: Everyone pretty much the whole world knows it's coming.

419
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:56,110
Scott: They know the chances of the world.

420
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:58,690
Scott: It's not one of those things where there's a chance the world could end.

421
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,377
Scott: It's like there's a chance.

422
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:03,270
Scott: it maybe could not end maybe but now it's probably gonna end.

423
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:09,950
Rym: The characters in the show the characters we are, you know experiencing this world through their eyes.

424
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:15,367
Rym: These people Masada Shinji y'all they know that the world is ending.

425
00:30:15,387 --> 00:30:16,994
Rym: That's it They're.

426
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:18,442
Scott: they're all happening.

427
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:22,350
Scott: It's not happening quickly It's happening over the course of many many many days.

428
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,215
Scott: They have a lot of time to think about and the whole world knows it - no It's not like it is big.

429
00:30:26,335 --> 00:30:28,970
Scott: Well, it's somewhat secret, but it's not super secret.

430
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,598
Rym: Well, it's kind of like early on in the show The world isn't 100 like they.

431
00:30:32,618 --> 00:30:43,522
Rym: you know, they know something's going on and but the guy, you know the moment God sent his angels to end the world and All nerve is is kind of humanity's last ditch.

432
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:45,186
Rym: Like there's a tiny chance.

433
00:30:45,246 --> 00:30:46,830
Rym: We might not all die.

434
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:52,850
Scott: It's basically big monsters are coming out of the sky trying to destroy the world and the humans see him.

435
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,359
Scott: It's kind of hard to hide a big giant monster and they're.

436
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:04,510
Scott: they're using all of the science of man to try to fight it off and They're barely making it now.

437
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:11,377
Rym: Of course part of what makes the show the gravity so powerful and makes the show so powerful is that Basically, they don't win.

438
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:13,244
Rym: I mean you've seen the end of Ava.

439
00:31:13,265 --> 00:31:17,562
Rym: a Lot of people joke and say yeah everyone dies, but no think about that.

440
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:19,409
Rym: It's not just a kill-em-all to me.

441
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:24,820
Rym: Everyone dies everyone everything existence Everything ends.

442
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:25,669
Rym: It's over.

443
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:27,475
Rym: Nothing exists.

444
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:28,539
Rym: It's done.

445
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,683
Rym: That's it.

446
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:30,545
Rym: Think about that.

447
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:31,950
Rym: Think about what that entails.

448
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:38,933
Scott: Well, the thing that really gets me is not so much that everyone dies at the end because there's a lot of shows where everyone Dies at the end.

449
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:41,845
Scott: It's that or at least everyone you care about that.

450
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:48,906
Scott: Yes, but it's not just that it's everyone yeah, but it's um It's that during the show, right?

451
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:57,450
Scott: The people in the world actually act as if it's the end of the world at least more so than in anything else.

452
00:31:57,571 --> 00:32:02,793
Scott: I can think of any other, you know story in any medium that you know comes to mind Right.

453
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:10,670
Scott: I mean there's this town that's the one city even though it's a highly defensible city We're all the mod or all the you know, crazy monsters are attacking.

454
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:18,270
Scott: So people all move away from that city and then you know, like the the UN stop the humanity they use, right?

455
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:23,870
Scott: I mean think about this right when you're in every day-to-day life even of the real world right now, right?

456
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:29,870
Scott: You know governments around the world they make decisions about how many resources to allocate towards different things.

457
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,778
Scott: You play a game like civilization, right?

458
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:37,803
Scott: You decide how many resources towards science How many towards defense how many towards these different things.

459
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:39,550
Scott: right in this situation?

460
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:49,775
Scott: You actually have the entire world Expanding 100% of its resources to stop the pretty much unstoppable end of the world.

461
00:32:49,815 --> 00:32:58,009
Scott: because if it's really the end and it's really horrible monsters attacking and you don't have you know, Some mystical Voltron that just comes out of nowhere for free.

462
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:08,147
Scott: You're gonna spend every single dollar every single person every single thing You've got for any chance that you can find and the world does that now.

463
00:33:08,248 --> 00:33:17,750
Rym: now at this point I mean we really I want to talk about because a Concept and a plot alone are not what can make something great because as Neil Gaiman always says the idea is nothing.

464
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,594
Rym: Everyone has ideas.

465
00:33:18,654 --> 00:33:19,679
Rym: doing it is what matters.

466
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,381
Scott: Yeah, because people would always write to Neil Gaiman Like I have this great idea for a story.

467
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:24,349
Scott: Do you want to write it with me?

468
00:33:24,731 --> 00:33:28,384
Scott: You know and Neil Gaiman's like listen your idea isn't worth anything.

469
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,170
Scott: everyone has a million ideas, right?

470
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:38,790
Scott: The only thing that's worth anything is not just your ability to turn that idea into something great But actually doing it your actual labor.

471
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:44,330
Scott: You actually have to sit down do it and make it happen and making it happen and hat is what's worth something.

472
00:33:44,390 --> 00:34:01,170
Rym: But Ava does all of these things incredibly well and incredibly subtly and I think it is my honest opinion That most of the people who have such an intense dislike for Evangelion Really honestly truly did not understand it and well not pay attention and don't know what it was about.

473
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:10,210
Scott: I think that a big part of the Evangelion that hurts a lot of people is that you know You really really really more so than a lot of other things I could think of it.

474
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:17,790
Scott: Let's say you have to pay attention With your conscious brain to every moment of it.

475
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:22,897
Scott: There are significant significant things where if you miss them You won't know what the hell's going on.

476
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:34,417
Scott: that will happen in like a second real quick like someone will say something like oh such-and-such or something will be in like the corner of a frame and You know the the.

477
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:37,090
Scott: that shot will be on screen for maybe five seconds.

478
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:45,129
Scott: And if you didn't see it, you're missing something major in the show and when people talk about it later You'll be like what the hell are they talking about?

479
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:49,208
Scott: You have to pay attention to every single word and every single thing you see.

480
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:55,610
Scott: and Even you know I paid really close attention and there are even some things where I had to rewind a little bit because I know I missed something.

481
00:34:56,192 --> 00:35:02,770
Scott: And if you don't do that, I can understand why you wouldn't get the show or think it was so great because you didn't see it.

482
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,527
Rym: But even that's it.

483
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:11,142
Rym: No, no see because even then even if you don't understand all those kind of you know What was instrumentality and what exactly was happening?

484
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:12,790
Rym: That's not the point of the show.

485
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:17,610
Rym: I mean that's I think that's what really trips people up that the show was a bait-and-switch.

486
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:33,669
Rym: It started as this monster of the week show got a bunch of people watching it and bit by bit That's all stripped away like an onion and then at the end you left with nothing and the last two episodes very literally Sit you down and say look none of that bullshit mattered at all.

487
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:35,639
Rym: Here's what this show was about.

488
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:39,629
Rym: and what it was about was brilliant And I think the way it was portrayed in the end was great.

489
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:52,962
Rym: And I think a lot of people just they didn't see the forest for the trees They saw that end and they didn't think about what that meant about solipsism about identity about Psychosis about you know humanity they thought.

490
00:35:53,343 --> 00:35:55,330
Rym: but what happened to the giant robots?

491
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,949
Scott: Yeah, because they were only understanding the show on a surface level and they were just.

492
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:01,892
Scott: you know And it's.

493
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:09,015
Scott: it's not hard to understand how you could enjoy the show on the surface level because the show is I mean You know people always talk about.

494
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:19,776
Scott: you know things being deep or things being shallow right and in reality at least according to me If you give something can only be enjoyed on the deep level But on the surface level it's crap.

495
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:24,475
Scott: or if something on the surface level is great, but has no depth to it That's both crap.

496
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:30,717
Scott: good things are good from top to bottom and Evangelion is good from top to bottom.

497
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,742
Scott: that surface level robot show.

498
00:36:32,783 --> 00:36:34,186
Scott: that's in the beginning right.

499
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:40,168
Scott: fighting the monsters is One of the best surface level robot shows ever easily, but

500
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:53,301
Rym: at the same time I think a lot of people they get hung up on very little details about the show like they see something like they really wonder About these things and they care so much about the minute Fanboy details of the show that as a result.

501
00:36:53,321 --> 00:36:55,470
Rym: They can't see the wholeness of the work.

502
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:58,141
Rym: They get so zoomed in about what.

503
00:36:58,462 --> 00:37:00,510
Rym: why did the guy in the back of sale?

504
00:37:00,992 --> 00:37:05,107
Rym: This the reason to the other guy who said this man what exactly was the room of golf?

505
00:37:05,148 --> 00:37:06,814
Rym: and oh my god Kabbalah Kabbalah.

506
00:37:06,854 --> 00:37:14,549
Scott: many shows and many books and many movies like to do a thing where they They they let you know that a secret exists.

507
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:15,412
Scott: They're like.

508
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:21,090
Scott: they'll say something you know that is sort of or they'll present an enigma of somewhere.

509
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:22,018
Scott: They'll they'll show.

510
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:27,530
Scott: they'll show you something visually But not tell you or explain what it was you just saw in any way.

511
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,823
Scott: They just show you something and then you're left thinking what was that?

512
00:37:31,024 --> 00:37:31,767
Scott: They showed it to me.

513
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:32,630
Scott: It must be something.

514
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,868
Scott: what was it you know as a Chekhov's gun of some kind.

515
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:41,127
Scott: and Evangelion shows you more stuff without explaining what it is right away.

516
00:37:41,147 --> 00:37:45,221
Scott: then Think about how many things it's like three or four things so far.

517
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:47,370
Scott: where I've said it does it more than anything else.

518
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:56,150
Scott: right Evangelion is harder better faster stronger than all the rest in every way But at the same show has a lot of secrets but show does something really.

519
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:59,080
Rym: Here's kind of the important part of what it is that makes Ava good.

520
00:37:59,682 --> 00:38:10,791
Rym: a lot of shows that try to be deep Though it shows that people accused of being pretentious Sometimes are and the reason they are is that they don't actually have a lot to say or they can't say what they want to Say.

521
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,970
Rym: well, so they will hide behind layers of obscurity.

522
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:23,310
Rym: They will make things obtuse on purpose and they'll like they'll flash things on screen That just confuse you and then there was no way you could have figured them out.

523
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:33,505
Rym: But I'll say this if you watch Ava and you're reasonably intelligent and you pay attention You just and I mean pay attention to a reasonable level not even to the Scott level.

524
00:38:33,525 --> 00:38:41,990
Rym: if you never rewind back You just watch the show with your attention You will get 95% of what happened and you will be able to understand the wholeness of the show.

525
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:50,383
Scott: I was incredibly surprised upon my most recent watching how many of the secrets are just Plainly said exactly what the secret is.

526
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:51,590
Scott: They just come out and say it.

527
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:57,110
Scott: There was a whole episode where they basically tell you the past of everything right where they show you.

528
00:38:57,411 --> 00:38:59,620
Scott: You know all the adults and they were kids and everything.

529
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,870
Scott: and I'm like, I totally forgot that episode even existed.

530
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:04,699
Scott: But the episode basically tells you everything.

531
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:14,864
Scott: it just spells it out and spills the beans right there in plain English And I was left wondering like hi I wonder why people always thought that the show is so hard to figure out.

532
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:16,430
Scott: they're pretty much telling you everything.

533
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:26,316
Scott: There are even early episodes where they just come out with stuff like oh, yeah this by the way You know, I always thought the reveal of the you know, Ava's being you know Biological was in.

534
00:39:26,637 --> 00:39:29,390
Scott: you know that later episode where Ava zero one goes crazy.

535
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:38,210
Scott: Episode two they reveal their biological because the armor falls off at Ava one's face and it's got like the crazy jaw in there.

536
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:38,994
Rym: All right, speaking of that.

537
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:40,382
Rym: I think we should talk a little bit.

538
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:44,461
Rym: spelled out the Specific things like why we say this.

539
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:46,008
Rym: cuz I mean we can't go into every detail.

540
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:51,430
Rym: someday I want to do a clip panel where I show these things because I went to this great lecture at Emily's school.

541
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,214
Rym: you know NYU.

542
00:39:52,234 --> 00:40:05,048
Rym: a while ago in the the professor did a lecture about citizen Kane and What he did is he would show like he'd say, you know The show did this symbolism and then he would show you all the scenes where it was done.

543
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:10,023
Rym: then he'd say It's poignant and relevant because they use these camera angles to do this effect.

544
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:12,130
Rym: and then he'd show you the scenes and he'd say any.

545
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:12,757
Rym: Look at that.

546
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:18,240
Rym: Look how the camera is on this scene But it's focused on this character and not this character.

547
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,750
Rym: the focus of the lens is on this background character.

548
00:40:20,991 --> 00:40:22,561
Rym: Why because of XYZ?

549
00:40:22,581 --> 00:40:23,970
Rym: and then he would back up all these points.

550
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:40,129
Rym: You could do a series of lectures on Ava and I I'm going to say this I believe that Ava is so well put together that it would handily stand up to that level of I guess dissection and that level of analysis by PhDs in film.

551
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:52,530
Rym: Easily I'm not even like a Contest and I would love to see someone like that Analyze Ava that way partly because I don't think I have the time or the effort or the knowledge to pull it off.

552
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,661
Rym: But like what does Ava do like?

553
00:40:54,721 --> 00:41:02,575
Rym: I want to talk a little bit about sound Ava's soundtrack and when I wrote no that soundtrack sound scape Is amazing.

554
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:06,127
Rym: well because it's not just the music the music is very important.

555
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:08,357
Rym: notice how the music Changes throughout the show.

556
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:14,188
Rym: there are themes in the show like the Happy misato theme the everyone's hanging out.

557
00:41:14,248 --> 00:41:21,383
Rym: You know using that one Songs appear they have like characters have light motifs, and they come and go.

558
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:25,295
Rym: but yeah a lot of those light motifs Disappear.

559
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:43,221
Rym: the tone of the show Changes as it goes on and if you went through the show like there you can point out the exact moment I guess where the music died where the laughter died where you hear a song and see a scene and you could say Definitively that music is never played again.

560
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:45,468
Rym: a scene like that never happens again.

561
00:41:45,488 --> 00:41:55,421
Rym: in fact There's a point at which you can say there is not a single joke Nor is there a moment of levity of any kind.

562
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:58,330
Rym: from this point forward until the end of the show.

563
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,102
Rym: This was the last moment you could smile.

564
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:04,288
Scott: This was the last joke early on in the show.

565
00:42:04,811 --> 00:42:12,790
Scott: Right it's you know even though there's some weird stuff going on fighting aliens chance at the end of the world weird stuff right?

566
00:42:13,091 --> 00:42:13,936
Scott: There's some jokes.

567
00:42:13,976 --> 00:42:27,928
Scott: you've got misato getting drunk acting silly Asek and Shinji Bicker with each other and Shinji fighting with each other that episode where they do the music and they basically play DDR And that episode is directed by the guy who directed Fullmetal Alchemist by the way.

568
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:33,664
Rym: yes And that episode and you can sort of tell but that episode stands out as being amazing.

569
00:42:33,704 --> 00:42:35,148
Rym: and all these things.

570
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:41,426
Rym: the show Starts out with a like you know 40% humor, and then you know 60% everything else voice.

571
00:42:41,486 --> 00:42:43,994
Scott: It's not humor fun It's you know it's it.

572
00:42:44,255 --> 00:42:52,061
Scott: There's sort of normal everyday anime kind of stuff going on some of the time Maybe 30 40 percent of the time even when poignant thing happened.

573
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:52,824
Rym: things happen.

574
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:54,350
Rym: There is a little bit of levity.

575
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:54,613
Rym: You know.

576
00:42:54,653 --> 00:42:54,916
Rym: you know.

577
00:42:55,057 --> 00:43:00,749
Rym: it's kind of the idea that The show builds up tension, and then there is release and it builds up tension And then there's release.

578
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:13,807
Rym: But the show does something clever and I could point to a thousand examples of this where In the beginning the show builds up say five tension points And then eventually you know it drops excited like opening parentheses and closing parentheses.

579
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:26,518
Rym: when you're writing code It'll open five then close to that open one more, but then it closes them all again you get release But as the show goes on it all it'll start and like episodes will end Without all the tension being released.

580
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:33,807
Rym: and then the next episode like more attention is introduced But even less is released, and there's a point at which they just stop releasing.

581
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:46,164
Rym: like seriously I mean Scott says that but no literally there's a point in the show at which There is no more release at all until the last until the last One minute and five seconds of the show give or take.

582
00:43:46,486 --> 00:43:51,250
Rym: like up until that point There are like a six episodes fan where there is no release at all.

583
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,521
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh fight a nasty robot get freaked out.

584
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:56,067
Scott: Oh, but we're now we're in school.

585
00:43:56,127 --> 00:44:01,781
Rym: all right all right Get freaked out not even be happy.

586
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:05,935
Rym: I mean remember when Shinji stops He kills karo.

587
00:44:06,196 --> 00:44:11,050
Rym: you know the lad that the second to last the last angel whatever, but he feels bad about it.

588
00:44:11,371 --> 00:44:13,658
Rym: He wins he kills it the next.

589
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:22,162
Rym: you know the next scene that you see is not hooray It's Shinji saying I should have died it shouldn't have been him.

590
00:44:22,182 --> 00:44:23,466
Rym: I feel nothing.

591
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:24,589
Rym: the world is dead.

592
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:25,655
Scott: basically He starts.

593
00:44:25,756 --> 00:44:34,692
Scott: they start carrying over The you know the craziness of the previous episodes into the next one, but like it's not just you know early on It's like okay.

594
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:47,312
Scott: They carry over episode one into episode two okay, but then as you go on it is Monster of the week and the monster is only there for the week, and then once they get rid of the monster You know it's like okay.

595
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:48,996
Scott: Whoo we beat that mod.

596
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:57,990
Scott: later in the show the monsters are Well You know Ray gets Ray gets injured she remains injured for a significant amount of time.

597
00:44:58,391 --> 00:45:00,958
Scott: Shinji gets sucked into that weird other dimension.

598
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:05,696
Scott: He's fucked up for like two episodes, but it's not just that then asagum And she's fucked up.

599
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:07,529
Scott: She's fucked up for the entire rest of the show.

600
00:45:07,731 --> 00:45:09,399
Scott: He's done, but here's the thing.

601
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:11,550
Rym: the show like I was gonna say it's kind of cliche.

602
00:45:11,771 --> 00:45:16,650
Rym: You know the monsters remain, but no the monsters remain because they're in the heads of the characters.

603
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:22,250
Rym: But you've seen the end of the show, and I think it's safe to say the monsters are the characters.

604
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:25,579
Rym: Yeah, it's like the characters themselves are it?

605
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,537
Rym: and the show just like you know that scene where Shinji says I should have died not Him and there's no release of the tension.

606
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:33,905
Rym: even then what does the Misato say?

607
00:45:33,945 --> 00:45:36,615
Rym: she doesn't say it's all right She doesn't comfort Shinji.

608
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:42,616
Rym: She basically says no you were right to kill him, and then he says You're cold.

609
00:45:42,736 --> 00:45:51,696
Rym: You're a cold person, and then it ends There's no release at all and the show starts getting uncomfortable to watch.

610
00:45:52,137 --> 00:46:08,570
Rym: and part of that uncomfortableness, I think is because as Kind of the world is stripped away and as the show becomes more and more about the characters and their motivations because there's nothing left in the show You start to get uncomfortable because you identify with the characters, and you don't want to because you hate them.

611
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:23,969
Scott: Well you have to be uncomfortable in that kind of situation because you're in the city where the giant horrible aliens that no one Understands are attacking this spot for some reason right trying to do and if they win It's the end of the world.

612
00:46:24,492 --> 00:46:29,709
Scott: You're a very small group of people the only people who can possibly save the world and everyone else.

613
00:46:29,729 --> 00:46:36,670
Scott: everyone You know you know which is pretty much the happy people that you know were somewhat normal at least all moved away.

614
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:38,030
Scott: There's no one there.

615
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,330
Scott: You're all alone in this horrible base.

616
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:52,290
Scott: You know these horrible robots and machines, and it's quiet and scary and mysterious, and you know you're just Waiting away the days until either you lose the world ends or you save it.

617
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:54,510
Scott: And then what you're fucked up from the experience.

618
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,774
Scott: Even then it's.

619
00:46:55,874 --> 00:46:58,643
Scott: it's even worse than waiting in the mall for the zombies to eat.

620
00:46:58,703 --> 00:47:03,450
Rym: everybody get back to the structure because again that Idea is not new and not special in and of itself.

621
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:07,950
Rym: But Ava just does it so well because they make you feel like the people there.

622
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:12,490
Scott: I mean if you watch Dawn of the Dead you know I don't really feel so much like the people in the mall.

623
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:15,587
Scott: You know as much as maybe I could in Ava.

624
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:20,350
Rym: well I think I feel worse than what it is is they force it on you in a very subtle way.

625
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:22,629
Rym: I mean the beginning of the show and watch.

626
00:47:23,313 --> 00:47:26,970
Rym: Notice how background characters are rarely drawn in a generic style.

627
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:32,133
Rym: They're often the background characters you see in the beginning of the show are often unique Characters.

628
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:34,684
Rym: someone pointedly drew them all to be different.

629
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:47,510
Rym: to stand out is different and The show goes a long way for one to show that all of humanity is kind of working together But - it goes out of its way to show you all the side characters you see all like.

630
00:47:47,811 --> 00:48:02,059
Rym: There's a scene where they're like putting together in an early episode one of the plugs to plug into an Ava for something and They show you like 60 or 70 engineers and scientists and workmen and laborers and janitors all over the place Working on this.

631
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,487
Rym: you see all these people Everywhere you come to the city you see cars you see people in shop.

632
00:48:06,507 --> 00:48:07,090
Scott: the episode.

633
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:08,615
Rym: This is the important thing.

634
00:48:09,076 --> 00:48:12,707
Rym: you overhear a lot of conversations of side characters.

635
00:48:12,747 --> 00:48:14,729
Rym: people are talking speaking lines.

636
00:48:15,515 --> 00:48:26,268
Rym: That totally goes away bit by bit And then you realize towards the end of the show that you haven't seen anyone at all But a very tiny subset of main characters for much of the.

637
00:48:26,288 --> 00:48:38,253
Scott: yeah The episode of the power goes out right and Gendo is there with all these engineers like you know turning cranks on everything to make everything work is with all the manual backups and everything Later on.

638
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:42,985
Scott: it's basically like six people at a computer, and there's no one else around do.

639
00:48:43,025 --> 00:48:52,827
Scott: they walk around this gigantic Gigantic gigantic underground base and early in the show it'd be like they'd walk around the base And there'd be other people walking around the base opening the doors up and down the escalators.

640
00:48:53,249 --> 00:48:56,403
Scott: now They're always alone in the elevator whenever they're in an elevator.

641
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,696
Scott: if someone else comes in the elevator It's always another one of the characters.

642
00:49:00,098 --> 00:49:01,743
Scott: you only ever see the characters.

643
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:10,051
Scott: everyone else is gone and even when People there are people who aren't the characters that come in you know the main characters that do come into play at that point in The show.

644
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:16,411
Scott: there's an episode where you know Oscar runs away and someone goes to and they like UN or some spy guys go and find Her.

645
00:49:16,512 --> 00:49:17,922
Rym: but notice how now these care.

646
00:49:17,942 --> 00:49:20,496
Scott: They don't show you that guy They're all faceless there.

647
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:22,506
Rym: if they have a voice is completely off-screen.

648
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:26,700
Scott: you see his shadow And you only see Asuka and even the guys in sele.

649
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,208
Scott: they become sound only and you never see them again.

650
00:49:29,348 --> 00:49:29,850
Rym: that I mean.

651
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:31,878
Rym: That is one of those brilliant things.

652
00:49:31,939 --> 00:49:35,936
Rym: as to what makes Ava like the subtlety that is there I mean look early on.

653
00:49:35,956 --> 00:49:43,049
Rym: you know sele is not there when the sele got the old man Who by the way if you're if you're looking to read things into the show?

654
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:44,794
Rym: They're Jewish.

655
00:49:45,556 --> 00:49:57,590
Rym: now seriously think about that for a minute and think about Judeo-Christian mythology, but I'll get back to that later, so But they meet via these video conferences and the way those scenes are put together amazing.

656
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:16,010
Rym: But then as Scott pointed out as all the character all the people who aren't the main characters all the excuses Every excuse the characters have to not face the monsters inside themselves to not face themselves To pretend that other people are around and therefore they can just keep living their lives.

657
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:19,789
Rym: They won't have to confront everything that they really are because there's no one left in the world.

658
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:25,830
Rym: There's at that very pointed moment where you see sele again, and there is no longer sele.

659
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:39,890
Rym: It is just big black monoliths sound only you stop seeing their faces, and that's not just allegory It's not just color It's not just this subtle shift toward alienation and toward forcing people who are alone to confront themselves.

660
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:44,203
Rym: It has very literal meaning as to what's going on at the end of the show.

661
00:50:44,263 --> 00:50:45,507
Rym: Yes, they are they.

662
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:46,390
Scott: what are they doing?

663
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,039
Scott: Yeah, why is sele sound only?

664
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,246
Scott: they were holograms before.

665
00:50:49,286 --> 00:50:49,830
Scott: what happened?

666
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:56,428
Scott: It's because they went somewhere where they can only have sound and there's no cameras to you know make the holograms any.

667
00:50:56,448 --> 00:50:59,882
Rym: now if you pay Attention to what's going on in the show you know this is gonna be.

668
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:01,568
Scott: they just tell you straight up where they went.

669
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:04,070
Rym: yes Notice how they were creating the Ava series.

670
00:51:04,471 --> 00:51:12,416
Rym: It's obvious like it's really obvious that they are all in the Ava series for whatever thing that is They're gonna do at the end of the world.

671
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:16,009
Scott: because remember you know sele is talking about how they really want to finish this.

672
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:27,086
Scott: you Know production series of Ava's you know yada yada yada And you know notice that if you ever have watched you know you're not gonna know this because you're not talking about episode the alternate App air right, but yes

673
00:51:27,106 --> 00:51:28,470
Rym: because remember They

674
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:34,223
Scott: TV show They're piloting that production series.

675
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:35,450
Scott: That's where they went.

676
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:39,689
Scott: They're all inside Ava's elsewhere, and that's why there's no holograms of them.

677
00:51:40,172 --> 00:51:42,743
Rym: But along with that a sense of alienation doesn't you know?

678
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:44,350
Rym: I'd mentioned the soundscape and then I left it.

679
00:51:44,430 --> 00:52:02,710
Rym: But aside from the light motifs and the music and the wonderful use they use the way they use Major minor or dissonant or augmented chords as their own kind of like like there are the light motifs But within those songs these different chords really jarringly like set the mood in different ways.

680
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,542
Rym: But it's also the sound effects.

681
00:52:04,562 --> 00:52:10,770
Scott: you know that sound of the cicadas That you hear people don't really I didn't catch this until the most recent watching right.

682
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:14,440
Scott: But there was a second impact in that you know way back when right.

683
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:18,634
Scott: the second impact was you know giant explosion in Antarctica.

684
00:52:18,674 --> 00:52:23,855
Scott: most people on earth think it was a. you know they tell them the story that it was a meteor that hit Nervous.

685
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:27,409
Rym: it wasn't basically Misato's dad who did that basically yeah?

686
00:52:29,011 --> 00:52:34,650
Scott: And you know Antarctica melted basically and as you know say global warming times a billion.

687
00:52:35,292 --> 00:52:37,300
Scott: And it's always summer.

688
00:52:37,641 --> 00:52:42,750
Scott: and the thing is when I watched it back in the day I sort of missed that fact that it was always summer.

689
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:49,120
Scott: It's not it's easy to miss that but if you're a Japanese person You know cicadas are big there in the summer.

690
00:52:49,622 --> 00:52:57,627
Scott: so hearing cicadas all the time Constant reminder that it's summer constant reminder that you know there's the worst global warming.

691
00:52:57,728 --> 00:52:58,510
Scott: Antarctica melted.

692
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:05,000
Scott: There was a huge like you know pre apocalypse many years ago And this is still always summer.

693
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:07,713
Rym: this is used to great effect I mean they taught.

694
00:53:07,733 --> 00:53:13,970
Rym: they mentioned briefly later the room of golf which is this old like Jewish Jewish mysticism thing and there's a lot of ways to read into it.

695
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:33,454
Rym: But it's the idea that in the heavens I guess technically in like the stakes like one of the specific heavens that I don't know a lot about this stuff, but there is the idea that all souls originate from this place and The Messiah the end of the world cannot come and will not come until that room is empty until the last soul is born into the world.

696
00:53:33,494 --> 00:53:47,749
Rym: and there's a separate myth part of that that the sounds of grasshoppers or the sounds of certain insects or the sounds of certain, but you know things in the environment are the sound that you hear when souls come out of this room or in this room.

697
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:52,289
Rym: and The cicadas are used in this very subtle way to allude to that.

698
00:53:52,831 --> 00:54:05,710
Rym: But they're also used as a light motif because you hear them in the background in certain kinds of scenes Usually to express alienation emptiness loneliness the fact that the world is empty and dying and there's nothing left.

699
00:54:06,393 --> 00:54:09,390
Rym: Yeah, and then there's more to it than that.

700
00:54:09,611 --> 00:54:13,470
Rym: There are a lot of subtle little references where someone I think miss out.

701
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:20,256
Rym: Oh, you know they say there's a very there's like a 0% chance that this is going to succeed Or a very low chance that this thing will succeed.

702
00:54:20,717 --> 00:54:23,485
Rym: and Masato says yeah, but there's a chance.

703
00:54:23,545 --> 00:54:34,530
Rym: It'll snow tomorrow, and if you didn't Remember or realize or think that it's summer all the time that it's never going to snow again That statement just sounds like yeah, and pigs will fly.

704
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,193
Rym: But it's actually.

705
00:54:35,213 --> 00:54:39,490
Rym: there's a lot more to it, and it's subtle and meaningful, and it's really easy to miss that stuff.

706
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:44,210
Rym: But I don't want to you know go into every detail because I don't want to spend the whole show pointing them all out.

707
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:47,409
Rym: But the show is full of references like that.

708
00:54:48,072 --> 00:54:56,010
Scott: Yeah, and because you know it's not I mean it's not the real world there Aren't really giant aliens and robots and all sorts of crazy shit like that.

709
00:54:56,151 --> 00:54:57,549
Scott: But it's other than that.

710
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:02,965
Scott: It's you know real human beings on earth in Japan and Tokyo number whatever right?

711
00:55:02,985 --> 00:55:04,670
Scott: so you three or four right?

712
00:55:05,574 --> 00:55:12,250
Scott: Cuz you know you can never get enough Tokyo's And you know the things that they talk about are plain English.

713
00:55:12,371 --> 00:55:16,390
Scott: It's not like loaded with proper nouns as much as you know say the prince of nothing is.

714
00:55:17,174 --> 00:55:25,430
Scott: And it's real easy for you know things they say For do you interpret them as per the real world because using real word real world words.

715
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:34,616
Scott: But really in that universe which you know they don't go and explain like all the details the universe like a lot of fantasy Kind of books will do you know.

716
00:55:34,656 --> 00:55:41,082
Scott: so you'll miss out that it actually means something different in that world because of the way things Are and because of the situation they're in.

717
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:45,589
Scott: and if you didn't pay attention You don't get it, and you think they said something else that they didn't say.

718
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:51,310
Rym: But I want to go back a little bit because Scott mentioned the episode where the powers out and everyone's kind of scrapping together.

719
00:55:52,491 --> 00:55:57,848
Rym: This episode has perhaps my favorite comedic moment in the entire show because you know we're talking about all the reasons.

720
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:03,730
Rym: the show was good Indeed and like how well put together it is, but the shallow parts are really well put together, too.

721
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:12,178
Rym: I mean the fight scenes are amazingly well choreographed and everything is great, but that scene where you know There's no air conditioning.

722
00:56:12,258 --> 00:56:12,741
Rym: It's hot.

723
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:13,365
Rym: It's dark.

724
00:56:13,405 --> 00:56:14,150
Rym: There's no power.

725
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:19,882
Rym: Everyone's in the uniforms you know doing their work and Someone remarks that yeah, we have to.

726
00:56:20,023 --> 00:56:22,896
Rym: you know it's hot and this sucks But we have to pull through.

727
00:56:22,956 --> 00:56:23,539
Rym: look at them.

728
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:25,767
Rym: look how cool and collected they are just cuts up to.

729
00:56:25,807 --> 00:56:27,689
Rym: you see Gando and Futsuki.

730
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:34,975
Rym: Gando's sitting there with his you know that pose that he always has and he looks totally cool and collected And he's not showing any discomfort at all.

731
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:38,527
Rym: and he's standing there, and he's just like they're in charge.

732
00:56:38,547 --> 00:56:52,669
Rym: They're in command and It cuts very briefly to a back shot of them And you see that both of them are in their uniforms from the waist up But they totally have their pants off and their feet are in buckets of ice water.

733
00:56:53,191 --> 00:56:54,596
Scott: yeah, it's a house good stuff.

734
00:56:54,937 --> 00:57:04,210
Rym: and or like when they get the the super sniper rifle to take out that early angel and Basically misato shows up at that research lab, and she's like yeah, we're here to take all your shit.

735
00:57:05,233 --> 00:57:13,610
Rym: And then she says all right ray and Ray just rips the roof off the off the stupid warehouse and reaches in and they don't show you any of this.

736
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:15,410
Rym: But she says now be careful.

737
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:18,261
Rym: That's a incredibly delicate piece of machinery.

738
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:25,950
Rym: and you immediately hear nothing But like 20 seconds of crashing and horrible destruction as she rips this thing out of the building.

739
00:57:26,632 --> 00:57:27,897
Rym: And I just thought that was really funny.

740
00:57:28,118 --> 00:57:42,438
Scott: It is really funny and in the episode with the laser even right It's like the show is all about the gravity of everything, you know It's like we're giving you all the electricity in Japan to fire this laser Literally literally.

741
00:57:42,518 --> 00:57:48,170
Scott: and you know at first, you know You can interpret that as sort of like a silly thing that happens in robot shows.

742
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:59,107
Scott: But in this show because it's not presented and you know Like it's just the animation style of it alone does a good enough job of you know Not making it seem like a messenger.

743
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:06,290
Rym: Z How much of that episode is dedicated to shots of thousands and thousands of people doing work.

744
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:24,109
Rym: they cut to all the infrastructure the amazing like you step back and think how Absolutely amazing and awe-inspiring it would be for humans to pull something like that off the sheer number of people the man-hours the effort and the fact that it barely works and it.

745
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:37,630
Rym: The show does such a good job of expressing to you the gravity of the situation and it does this time and time again And he uses amazing just like shots and sounds and techniques to like convey it in every possible way where you can't miss it.

746
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:39,537
Scott: And in the pad the power goes out.

747
00:58:39,597 --> 00:58:42,769
Scott: episode again, you know, everything has a manual backup.

748
00:58:43,613 --> 00:59:06,590
Scott: It's so like perfect every you know every single, you know You look around a lot of mecha design right and a lot of mecha design is lots and lots of little crazy Details all over it, you know, like little hatches and doors and things like that, right and Ava The mechanical design has some of that going on, but really actually all those little details, you know Usually you'll see like a robot have like a million things all over it.

749
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:07,896
Scott: Most of them are just decoration.

750
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:10,407
Scott: and Ava all the million things everywhere, right?

751
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,498
Scott: It's actually stuff that you can sort of.

752
00:59:13,538 --> 00:59:20,303
Scott: you sat there you can be like, oh, that's that and that's that and you know They actually draw this stuff like it's gonna be used and it is used.

753
00:59:20,343 --> 00:59:20,544
Rym: Yeah.

754
00:59:20,584 --> 00:59:29,955
Rym: I mean the shifts the difference between Gundam seed and the fire the low and greens and they basically just throw in proper nouns and they make them self consistent But it doesn't really matter.

755
00:59:29,975 --> 00:59:38,240
Rym: but in Ava all these details that they present to you are Self-consistent and matter on at least a shallow level.

756
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:47,770
Rym: but in many cases on a much deeper level - on a metaphorical level Not just mecha design but characters - yeah There's just there's so much there.

757
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:51,084
Rym: I mean I could spend forever talking about specific scenes.

758
00:59:51,124 --> 00:59:55,465
Rym: that like really moved me Like I think the scene this scene every time I see it.

759
00:59:55,505 --> 00:59:55,786
Rym: It gives me.

760
00:59:55,807 --> 00:59:56,490
Rym: it gives me chills.

761
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:07,589
Rym: There are two scenes more so than anything in the show that just like I get a chill when I see them and one I really want to mention is Just remember the angel that actually gets into the command center.

762
01:00:08,112 --> 01:00:11,389
Rym: Shinji doesn't want to pallet the robot it breaks down the wall.

763
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:14,902
Rym: Misato is standing there face-to-face with this angel.

764
01:00:15,384 --> 01:00:16,830
Rym: It is about to kill her.

765
01:00:17,251 --> 01:00:18,576
Rym: It is about to kill everyone.

766
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:30,050
Rym: the world is going to end it is over and Shinji who didn't want to fight Suddenly finds the will after that again Amazing conversation with Kaji and the watermelons and I could go on and on about Oh Kaji in his water.

767
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:33,440
Scott: Oh my god, but Kaji's like one of the best parts of the show period.

768
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:33,721
Scott: but

769
01:00:33,761 --> 01:00:56,455
Rym: the scene where it breaks in and the angel this Alien thing lumbers forward and looks them in the eye and Masato looks it in the eye and especially knowing what she went through as the child and what she is and why she's the way she is and the the amount of hate that is in her heart for these angels and just that whole scene and the music and the sounds and Everything is amazing.

770
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:59,764
Rym: And I literally like I get a chill every time I see that scene.

771
01:00:59,844 --> 01:01:00,666
Rym: I think it's beautiful.

772
01:01:00,686 --> 01:01:04,603
Rym: Yeah You have any Eva scenes.

773
01:01:05,045 --> 01:01:08,133
Scott: Eva scenes equally big.

774
01:01:08,454 --> 01:01:18,584
Rym: equal chill is when the Ava goes berserk near the end of the show and everyone finds out what it is as it Eats that angel and incorporates the s2 engine into itself.

775
01:01:18,985 --> 01:01:20,230
Scott: Yeah, that's a pretty difficult scene.

776
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:26,207
Rym: Yes But the partly because the sounds the Ava like the sounds the Ava makes are somewhat like they're disturbed.

777
01:01:26,227 --> 01:01:30,904
Rym: They're really disturbing They really really get under your skin and they're frightening.

778
01:01:31,004 --> 01:01:32,530
Rym: and they set the scene so well.

779
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:35,439
Scott: Things that always gets me is the you know, the.

780
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:42,481
Scott: there's the episode where Shinji sort of he gets sent like the What's it called like the other dimension where they fuck they call it?

781
01:01:42,963 --> 01:01:45,170
Rym: Oh, oh, yes the sure Dirac space.

782
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:53,830
Scott: He gets stuck in a sea of Dirac Right and then he comes back and like you can't get out of the robot He's stuck in there and they're like, he's not in there.

783
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:57,178
Scott: Yeah, it's just his suit floating in the in.

784
01:01:57,379 --> 01:01:58,563
Scott: Oh, I got to talk about.

785
01:01:58,603 --> 01:01:59,927
Scott: I can't not talk about that.

786
01:01:59,947 --> 01:02:00,589
Scott: What's it LHC?

787
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:02,315
Scott: What's the LCL?

788
01:02:02,596 --> 01:02:03,722
Scott: LCL god damn it.

789
01:02:03,882 --> 01:02:05,470
Rym: this is another example of people.

790
01:02:05,812 --> 01:02:08,030
Scott: This is an example of pay the fuck attention, right?

791
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:11,103
Scott: The whole show is about LCL.

792
01:02:11,364 --> 01:02:12,369
Rym: LCL is the show.

793
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:13,816
Scott: LCL is the show.

794
01:02:13,876 --> 01:02:17,512
Scott: if you don't realize that LCL is the show you weren't paying attention Right.

795
01:02:17,532 --> 01:02:18,195
Scott: All right.

796
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:22,875
Scott: So LCL is based on and I'm just gonna tell it to you straight in case you weren't paying attention Right.

797
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:25,071
Scott: and you've watched the show recently LCL.

798
01:02:25,252 --> 01:02:32,280
Scott: when they get in the in the Ava right the suit fills up with this yellow goop Right, and then somehow they can breathe in it and it works.

799
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:34,950
Rym: It's also the reason the Ava's work, right?

800
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:42,270
Scott: LCL is basically like this chemical that is like, you know how metal conducts electricity.

801
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:46,837
Rym: Well, LCL conducts souls basically, and it's a cross between like.

802
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:56,690
Rym: I mean metaphorically and literally in the show and I mean that specific metaphorically and On the surface level it's like a cross between primordial soup and amniotic fluid.

803
01:02:57,131 --> 01:03:08,611
Scott: Yep, and if you don't notice when you when they're walking around nerve and there's different doors that they open and things You'll see stuff like LCL pool fat this way LCL factory and they show you this way We're like.

804
01:03:08,912 --> 01:03:12,625
Rym: miss Ritsuko was clearly working with the LCL.

805
01:03:12,685 --> 01:03:17,964
Scott: She was diving in it Yeah, and you look down, you know in the.

806
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:19,650
Scott: I guess that's in the movie.

807
01:03:19,991 --> 01:03:24,450
Scott: But now in terminal dogma you see this at the at the bottom bottom bottom, right?

808
01:03:25,378 --> 01:03:26,689
Scott: Bottom is terminal dog.

809
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:28,616
Scott: Where Adam?

810
01:03:28,717 --> 01:03:29,803
Rym: Oh, I'm sorry Lilith.

811
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:35,610
Scott: Yes crucified Adam slash Lilith is stuck on the cross with or without the lancey vlogging news, right?

812
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:37,032
Scott: That's it.

813
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:40,023
Scott: Just the whole thing is just this endless sea of LCL.

814
01:03:40,043 --> 01:03:41,187
Scott: That's what they make all of it.

815
01:03:41,388 --> 01:03:41,729
Rym: Look at it.

816
01:03:41,991 --> 01:03:43,178
Rym: All right, the.

817
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:48,237
Rym: it is crucified there LCL is coming out of it.

818
01:03:48,618 --> 01:03:48,859
Scott: Yep.

819
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:49,782
Rym: Where do you what do you think?

820
01:03:49,802 --> 01:03:50,264
Rym: they're getting?

821
01:03:50,304 --> 01:03:50,987
Rym: the LCL.

822
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:51,970
Scott: and here's one more.

823
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:56,150
Scott: This is from the movie, but I can't not say it right at the end of the movie.

824
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:58,790
Scott: It's famous because of the part where everyone dies.

825
01:03:59,372 --> 01:04:04,306
Scott: Everyone sort of it just explodes right like boom, but it's not just they explode not exploding.

826
01:04:04,326 --> 01:04:07,297
Scott: They're basically Turning into LCL.

827
01:04:07,317 --> 01:04:10,048
Scott: They're not exploding with blood everywhere again loading into yellow goo.

828
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,018
Rym: Literally, literally it is.

829
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,390
Rym: they are LCL because we are LCL.

830
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:24,418
Scott: So that's how the human instrumentality project which you know combining all human beings into one being LCL is the mechanism for that.

831
01:04:24,478 --> 01:04:33,148
Scott: everyone turns into LCL and there's a giant pool of yellow goop Literally giant pool of yellow goop and everyone's soul is transmitted in the yellow goop one pool.

832
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:34,573
Scott: now We're all one soul.

833
01:04:34,613 --> 01:04:36,238
Scott: We're one giant primordial ooze.

834
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:36,901
Scott: That's it.

835
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,887
Scott: That's it's literally that it's not.

836
01:04:38,947 --> 01:04:39,830
Scott: that's not some metaphor.

837
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:40,976
Scott: That's what it is.

838
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:42,304
Scott: Everyone turns in the yellow goop.

839
01:04:42,344 --> 01:04:43,490
Scott: That's a big pool of yellow goop.

840
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:49,010
Rym: But anyway, let's save until the very end of the show because we can give a very concise explanation.

841
01:04:49,071 --> 01:04:49,581
Rym: Didn't get it?

842
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:54,410
Rym: Oh, you know what happened because I think it's pretty obvious but it warrants discussion.

843
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:57,803
Rym: But the scene you were talking about because that is a very powerful scene.

844
01:04:58,446 --> 01:04:58,627
Scott: Mmm.

845
01:04:59,008 --> 01:05:00,810
Scott: All right completely forgot.

846
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:04,038
Scott: Where are you stuck in the Sea of Dirac?

847
01:05:04,058 --> 01:05:05,162
Scott: and then they can't get him out.

848
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:12,529
Scott: and then there's all this whole thing where it's Like, you know, yeah There was someone else that we tried to get out and it totally didn't work and that was Shinji's mom and whatnot.

849
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:13,654
Scott: And you know whatever.

850
01:05:13,674 --> 01:05:26,530
Scott: and then like at the end of that episode he like Pops out and Then the episodes over and it's like ah plus it's not that the popping out that gets you It's the episode over right away.

851
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:32,110
Scott: It's a lot like that episode of Eska flown a where the robots bleeding and then over right away a new episode plus.

852
01:05:32,531 --> 01:05:39,303
Rym: That scene is so I mean the show does a really good job of having characters express real raw Painful to watch.

853
01:05:39,445 --> 01:05:39,850
Rym: emotion.

854
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:45,950
Rym: I mean the way Misato reacts to Shinji reappearing and the way she reacts to the fact that she thought he was gone.

855
01:05:46,732 --> 01:05:54,955
Rym: That is some powerful stuff and even more powerful the scene still to this day gets to me when Misato Finds out that Kaji is dead.

856
01:05:54,975 --> 01:06:09,376
Rym: Mm-hmm and the way and how and not not just That how she finds out and that she finds out and not just the last words in that answering machine because I choked up I mean when the first time I saw Eva and then

857
01:06:09,396 --> 01:06:11,222
Scott: she listened the answering machine again

858
01:06:11,442 --> 01:06:14,694
Rym: over and over those words, you know I'll say the words.

859
01:06:14,734 --> 01:06:15,618
Rym: I should have said you wait.

860
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:17,386
Rym: I'll admit the first time I saw the show.

861
01:06:17,487 --> 01:06:26,610
Scott: I cried Really hard at that scene, but there's another thing you might miss is uh, you know, the the pill that goes on there Yes, and they reference that multiple times.

862
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:39,862
Rym: But anyway, that scene is so powerful and it's not just her reaction and how visceral it is but the fact that it's also so important to the show because She you're watching the show you feel like shit.

863
01:06:39,882 --> 01:06:40,845
Rym: You feel terrible.

864
01:06:40,865 --> 01:06:43,713
Rym: You're incredibly incredibly You.

865
01:06:43,853 --> 01:06:54,277
Rym: it's awkward and difficult to watch someone in the depths of so much anguish and despair And yet so that they're they're not even you know They're acting totally whack like a person does.

866
01:06:54,458 --> 01:07:00,996
Rym: but at the same time now it cuts to Shinji and he hears this and there's that scene where he opened.

867
01:07:01,016 --> 01:07:06,676
Rym: he sees he opens his door and he sees her there and he hears her and He's like you.

868
01:07:06,737 --> 01:07:12,861
Rym: now you're him you identify with him Observing this and he cannot deal with it any better than you can.

869
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:24,560
Rym: and he does not go to say anything and he just he Turns away from it and he he can't even muster any Amounts of sympathy like he can't do anything for her.

870
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:26,488
Rym: He's so separate and cut off from her.

871
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:32,289
Rym: and that scene Really that scene kind of encapsulates can't place everything that Ava was really about.

872
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:37,810
Scott: Yeah I mean a lot of shows, you know more shallow shows, you know, and that's what they are is more shallow shows, right?

873
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:42,666
Scott: It's people have predictable, you know simple emotional response to things.

874
01:07:42,987 --> 01:07:47,756
Scott: someone dies We all cry, you know We win we all cheer.

875
01:07:47,816 --> 01:07:58,970
Rym: and some shows really manipulate Fullmetal Alchemist when they killed a certain character Really just manipulated you and milked it, but it didn't really mean that much in the in the wider scheme of the show.

876
01:07:59,071 --> 01:08:01,550
Rym: No, it was just a sad scene to make you feel bad.

877
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:07,955
Scott: But the thing is in the real world with real people, you know Emotions aren't that simple.

878
01:08:08,015 --> 01:08:15,298
Scott: people are fucked the fuck up and they do weird shit and they act in Completely irrational and screwed up ways.

879
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:18,830
Scott: and you know, it things are a lot more complex than that.

880
01:08:19,211 --> 01:08:29,210
Scott: I just think you know having the you know, only like, you know a range of like, you know Six different distinct emotions and then each one like worried angry, you know sad.

881
01:08:29,591 --> 01:08:31,200
Scott: No, the things are a lot weirder than that.

882
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:36,330
Scott: and Ava actually, you know I guess people in Ava are a little more crazy, but it's the end of the world.

883
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,029
Rym: What do you expect see at the same time though?

884
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:46,581
Rym: They really aren't in a lot of ways because they really kind of encapsulate the fundamental ideas and problems that all humans face.

885
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:51,868
Rym: the thing is because I mean Humans can deal with these problems much like in the show.

886
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:57,109
Rym: Notice how people the characters are dealing with these problems partly because there are a lot of other people around.

887
01:08:58,852 --> 01:09:02,866
Rym: As the show goes on there aren't as many people around which means there is less.

888
01:09:03,346 --> 01:09:10,229
Rym: there are less places They can go to hide from their own emotions There are less ways people can distract themselves and what's going on inside of themselves.

889
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:18,270
Scott: Yeah, no one's making you know, TV shows at the end of the world, you know I mean, I think there's a TV show that's on sort of earlier in the show.

890
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:23,069
Scott: You can see on some of the screens but later on, you know what she's got like his Walkman.

891
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:23,652
Scott: That's.

892
01:09:23,773 --> 01:09:24,697
Scott: that's about it.

893
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:29,234
Rym: notice how he listens to the same couple of songs over and over and over again And they really use that.

894
01:09:29,274 --> 01:09:34,917
Rym: Mckay that the these the scene the idea that he'll just keep looping the tape Over and over and over again.

895
01:09:34,978 --> 01:09:37,149
Rym: It's just like one of his final refuges from himself.

896
01:09:37,876 --> 01:09:38,085
Scott: Yeah

897
01:09:39,317 --> 01:10:09,830
Rym: the point of all this is that The show does not just have all these amazing ideas and all these really well put together thoughts But that it expresses them in an Incredibly deep and well put together way and that the show from a technical perspective and from a kind of look at it like how does it present its message is Beautiful and amazing and I can't imagine Someone like just not getting it or not feeling it or not understanding the emotion and how well it's put together.

898
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:16,770
Scott: Yeah, and that's not even counting the fact that you know The animation quality was a million times better than anything else at the time and the animation stands up.

899
01:10:17,294 --> 01:10:20,575
Scott: Things today, you know The sound quality was better than things.

900
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:30,430
Scott: everything about the production of it was better than the vast majority of anime productions Discounting only things like Satoshi kon miyazaki movies Akira, etc.

901
01:10:32,358 --> 01:10:44,929
Rym: but of course The real and I don't want to talk about this forever because we've gone on for a while and partly I just I want to express You know without having to worry about spoilers how good of a show I think this is now meaningful it is.

902
01:10:44,989 --> 01:10:47,159
Rym: but What was the show really about?

903
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:59,094
Rym: because remember this show very famously Starts out as a robot show those 24 episodes sits you down and says alright not gonna show you what happened Doesn't matter.

904
01:10:59,575 --> 01:11:09,370
Rym: Here's what I want you and I really honestly I'll say this again I just a few hours ago watched the last two episodes of Shin Seiki Evangelion again.

905
01:11:09,591 --> 01:11:14,770
Scott: I watched them a few weeks ago pre-pack, so I don't have them as quiet as clear in the mind, but they're they're clear enough.

906
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:22,096
Rym: People who say those episodes were a cop-out or who say that, you know the show it was just a total, you know Cop-out.

907
01:11:22,117 --> 01:11:22,949
Rym: they could have done it better.

908
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:24,574
Rym: You're wrong.

909
01:11:24,594 --> 01:11:27,125
Rym: It is my opinion that you're wrong.

910
01:11:27,386 --> 01:11:33,470
Rym: those episodes I'm honestly going to say this and they're not pretentious They're brilliant.

911
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:43,124
Scott: Well, first of all, right my memory before rewatching the show was that those episodes were like, you know The show was normal and then suddenly existential and weird.

912
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:44,450
Scott: that's not true at all.

913
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:47,162
Scott: The show gradually led into that.

914
01:11:47,444 --> 01:11:50,261
Scott: very very well, you know They have that whole part where it's like.

915
01:11:50,301 --> 01:12:01,061
Scott: you'll see like a vertical line squiggling and someone will talk then a horizontal squiggly line and someone else will talk then like the square and someone else will talk or the Whole analogy where Shinji is free.

916
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:01,905
Rym: What is freedom?

917
01:12:01,925 --> 01:12:04,013
Scott: Oh Freedom.

918
01:12:04,496 --> 01:12:08,435
Scott: you go back, you know to episode, you know 15 and forward.

919
01:12:08,796 --> 01:12:18,170
Scott: they do all that shtick more and more and more as the show goes on You know, there's less and less just watching what's happening and more and more that weird stuff.

920
01:12:18,231 --> 01:12:19,589
Scott: And then at the end they just do full-on.

921
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,190
Rym: Well plus the pace of the show gets more and more frantic.

922
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,668
Rym: Escaflowne did this very well, too.

923
01:12:24,211 --> 01:12:32,320
Rym: And then towards the end of the show like the focus narrows the focus narrows not just as a show but in the characters minds in your minds and everywhere.

924
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,544
Rym: and it gets up to this.

925
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,249
Rym: fevers pay feverish pace of.

926
01:12:36,072 --> 01:12:39,562
Rym: We are fighting the Angels because we don't want the end of the world to happen.

927
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:44,135
Rym: and then at the end of the 24th episode They start, you know, they did it.

928
01:12:44,176 --> 01:12:44,597
Rym: they did it.

929
01:12:45,138 --> 01:12:46,662
Rym: they stopped the last angel.

930
01:12:47,445 --> 01:12:49,270
Rym: it's over they won.

931
01:12:50,312 --> 01:12:50,854
Rym: Now what?

932
01:12:50,914 --> 01:12:56,730
Rym: and you realize that the show's focus has narrowed and everyone, you know, what's ausgas deal?

933
01:12:56,910 --> 01:12:57,938
Rym: I'm nothing without Ava.

934
01:12:57,979 --> 01:12:58,503
Rym: What Shinji?

935
01:12:58,563 --> 01:13:01,367
Rym: I'm nothing Corollary, I'm nothing without Ava.

936
01:13:02,132 --> 01:13:05,089
Rym: Every everyone in the show the only characters left.

937
01:13:05,832 --> 01:13:10,750
Rym: There was nothing left for them, but Ava but fighting but fighting the angels.

938
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:12,054
Scott: Early on in the show.

939
01:13:12,074 --> 01:13:19,818
Scott: they these people actually have a lot going on, you know in their lives, you know, they got school They got you know work.

940
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:25,801
Scott: They got stuff, you know, go, you know, they're going out to dinner You know all kinds of stuff later in the show.

941
01:13:25,841 --> 01:13:27,728
Scott: They got nothing except saving the world.

942
01:13:27,768 --> 01:13:28,169
Scott: That's it.

943
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:33,583
Scott: Whatever a key see a character if they're not actively, you know fighting an angel off.

944
01:13:33,924 --> 01:13:35,469
Scott: They're sitting around going.

945
01:13:38,312 --> 01:13:50,230
Rym: But no the technical aspect of this the reason this works and the reason I say the end is not a cop-out But brilliant is that there was really no other way to end that show and it follows right along with the previous episodes.

946
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:58,940
Rym: it's basically the show did end in episode 24. the plot ended and the show had gotten you to the point where There was no more plot.

947
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:08,129
Rym: There was no more possibility of plot There was no more possibility of moving forward for any character in that show or for the show or for you as a viewer.

948
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:14,030
Rym: and Thus you think what now and I think the show did such a beautiful job of doing that.

949
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:20,514
Rym: I mean, I don't want to sit and you know go step by step through the last two episodes, but It's brilliant.

950
01:14:20,714 --> 01:14:23,104
Rym: They just sit the characters down and ask them.

951
01:14:23,646 --> 01:14:24,470
Rym: Why did you do this?

952
01:14:24,831 --> 01:14:26,040
Rym: We have come this far.

953
01:14:26,402 --> 01:14:28,113
Rym: you saved the world Why.

954
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:29,338
Rym: and they would say why.

955
01:14:29,418 --> 01:14:33,609
Rym: and then they would ask the same question very Socratic, you know Why do you pilot Ava?

956
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,174
Rym: Because I want to.

957
01:14:35,536 --> 01:14:36,480
Rym: why do you pilot Ava?

958
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,424
Rym: because I want to.

959
01:14:37,484 --> 01:14:38,187
Rym: why do you pilot it?

960
01:14:38,227 --> 01:14:38,709
Rym: pilot Ava?

961
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:40,955
Rym: Because because people tell me to.

962
01:14:41,035 --> 01:14:41,878
Rym: why do you pilot Ava?

963
01:14:42,299 --> 01:14:42,981
Rym: I don't know.

964
01:14:43,001 --> 01:15:05,775
Rym: and it's like all these characters being forced to To realize what they are because humans lie to themselves all the time and I've seen very little Literature movies books films anything that does such a good job of Driving that point into your head so well and so subtly and yet at the same time It's subtle, but it's not.

965
01:15:06,096 --> 01:15:10,708
Rym: it's subtle and that most people watching you don't realize what it's trying to make.

966
01:15:10,789 --> 01:15:16,907
Rym: you admit What is really trying to make the characters admit but at the same time it's being very blunt about it.

967
01:15:17,368 --> 01:15:17,970
Rym: What do you want?

968
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:18,473
Rym: I don't know.

969
01:15:18,533 --> 01:15:19,097
Rym: What do you want?

970
01:15:19,177 --> 01:15:19,459
Rym: I don't know.

971
01:15:19,519 --> 01:15:20,022
Rym: What do you want?

972
01:15:20,143 --> 01:15:21,149
Rym: I know but I won't admit it.

973
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:21,993
Rym: What do you want?

974
01:15:22,193 --> 01:15:30,504
Scott: the greatest part that I think is at the beginning of episode 26, I believe if I remember correctly They're like he'd be pretty much comes out and says in plain English.

975
01:15:31,086 --> 01:15:31,387
Scott: All right.

976
01:15:31,427 --> 01:15:36,490
Scott: Look I Wish I had the exact subtitles to just read out loud.

977
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:41,490
Scott: He's like we want to explore this idea and answer this question, right?

978
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:44,483
Scott: But we don't have time to answer this question for all the characters.

979
01:15:44,824 --> 01:15:46,070
Scott: So we're just gonna look at Shinji.

980
01:15:46,572 --> 01:15:49,664
Scott: It's a just says that that's what the narrator says.

981
01:15:49,704 --> 01:15:50,326
Scott: that at the beginning.

982
01:15:50,387 --> 01:15:54,581
Scott: episode 26 Yes, and people are confused about what the episode is about.

983
01:15:54,943 --> 01:16:00,009
Scott: He just told you in plain English Oh my gosh, and then they do it and then the show is over.

984
01:16:00,612 --> 01:16:09,946
Rym: and I mean really the show deals with a lot of fundamental philosophical issues and you know What what am I and you think you know, what do you what think?

985
01:16:10,026 --> 01:16:10,990
Rym: ask yourself this question?

986
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:14,343
Rym: What are you and this you know, all the ideas of solipsism?

987
01:16:14,443 --> 01:16:16,050
Rym: and what is the soul and what is the mind?

988
01:16:16,191 --> 01:16:19,548
Rym: and what what am I and what are other people and what do I exist for?

989
01:16:19,568 --> 01:16:23,821
Rym: and These are questions that a lot of people don't deal with very well.

990
01:16:23,862 --> 01:16:36,789
Rym: They avoid when they think about it and the show Ava Does an incredibly good job I think of addressing these issues in an intellectual and philosophical way and also in a clever and accessible way.

991
01:16:37,972 --> 01:16:41,536
Rym: Mmm, I think the show says what it says Incredibly well.

992
01:16:41,717 --> 01:16:42,159
Scott: Oh here here.

993
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:44,008
Scott: I got I found the script online real quick.

994
01:16:44,028 --> 01:16:44,310
Scott: You ready?

995
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,055
Scott: This is what the narrator says.

996
01:16:46,095 --> 01:16:47,921
Scott: the beginning of episode 26 already.

997
01:16:48,181 --> 01:16:51,892
Scott: if this isn't plain English and not weird I don't know what is.

998
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:54,218
Scott: it was 2016 ad.

999
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:55,782
Scott: that's not hard to understand.

1000
01:16:56,423 --> 01:17:03,519
Scott: the thing that people lost in other words the compensation the Complimentation of the mind has begun.

1001
01:17:03,539 --> 01:17:05,710
Rym: God instrumentality, right?

1002
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:09,402
Scott: However, there is not enough time to describe the entire process.

1003
01:17:09,483 --> 01:17:11,510
Scott: We've only got like a 20-minute episode here.

1004
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:23,278
Rym: We can't show you Every single soul on all of Earth combining into one pile of yellow goop now at the same time for anyone who says those Episodes are crap cop-outs because of no budget Watching those episodes again.

1005
01:17:23,298 --> 01:17:29,404
Rym: I want to point out that while all this is going on He shows you Masato dead shot.

1006
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:30,870
Rym: She was shot and she is dead.

1007
01:17:31,171 --> 01:17:36,928
Rym: It shows Ritsuko shot dead and then it immediately shows Ritsuko and Masato talking to each other.

1008
01:17:36,948 --> 01:17:39,069
Scott: Yep Anyway, I'm not done yet.

1009
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:47,510
Scott: Therefore we will examine the Complimentation right the instrumentality of the mind of a single boy named Ikari Shinji.

1010
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:57,105
Scott: So what he's telling you here is it couldn't be more plain Every mind on earth combined into one which was the instrumentality project.

1011
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:58,930
Scott: So that's that's six billion plus.

1012
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:03,570
Scott: I don't know how many people were alive in the year 2016 when the room of golf was empty, right?

1013
01:18:04,671 --> 01:18:20,930
Scott: Every single soul and all of the entire earth went through an experience of combining into one right and In order to tell the complete story We would have to tell you all six or seven billion stories of every single thing that all those souls felt and went through.

1014
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:26,329
Scott: But we can't do that and look 20 minute TV show and look at all the like glimpses that it gives you.

1015
01:18:26,556 --> 01:18:33,666
Scott: Yep So we're just gonna show you What happened to Shinji during this process and that way you'll get a better understanding of it.

1016
01:18:33,706 --> 01:18:39,770
Scott: because you know what if we actually Just had a camera looking at the world All you would see was a big pile of yellow group that you saw in the movies.

1017
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:43,350
Scott: You don't know anything that's going on because there's no characters.

1018
01:18:43,492 --> 01:18:44,869
Scott: It's a big pile of yellow slime.

1019
01:18:45,532 --> 01:18:55,967
Rym: But I mean and look like they give you glimpses like that that amazing scene and the amazing voice acting where Masato You know, yeah the whole idea of the Hedgehog's dilemma and the AT field.

1020
01:18:55,987 --> 01:19:08,058
Rym: and then you know Near the end of the show when you find out what the AT field really is you know the boundary between people the reason we have the Hedgehog's dilemma the fact that Solipsistically no human being can ever share truly what they are with other human beings.

1021
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,040
Rym: all that blah blah blah blah blah.

1022
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:32,485
Rym: Masato shows Masato desperately not wanting other people to see what was really in her heart and just horrified and afraid and crying and screaming because Shinji and Kenji and Fuyutsuki and Every single person in the world her father are seeing Everything that she is.

1023
01:19:32,786 --> 01:19:33,869
Rym: there are no secrets.

1024
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,939
Rym: It's kind of like a god looking down on a two-dimensional world.

1025
01:19:37,822 --> 01:20:05,083
Rym: I mean think about that think about what instrumentality is the whole show is people unable to deal with each other people who because they cannot share the Solipsistic nature of their own heart and soul with other people are fundamentally isolated from each other By the AT field by humanity by the fact that we are individual souls The fact that everyone in the world now has no secrets and everyone is one soul and nothing is sacred Nothing is hidden.

1026
01:20:05,685 --> 01:20:09,340
Rym: that is frightening and horrifying and that is what people are going through in the end of Eva.

1027
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:11,659
Rym: That is kind of the literal truth of what is happening.

1028
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,523
Rym: Instrumentality succeeded.

1029
01:20:13,603 --> 01:20:25,360
Scott: there goes yeah, and you have these people who are so emotionally fucked up because they won't even like Talk to each other openly and honestly because they don't want anyone to know what they're really like on the inside.

1030
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:32,407
Scott: So they're all putting on a show, you know, Asuka's putting on a show, you know being all strong and cool But really she's not.

1031
01:20:32,447 --> 01:20:35,180
Scott: she's crying about her, you know, bitch mom and whatnot.

1032
01:20:35,441 --> 01:20:41,231
Scott: But she acts all happy and bratty all the time and you know That the whole show is just.

1033
01:20:41,352 --> 01:20:42,879
Scott: all the characters act like that.

1034
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:44,745
Scott: But then it's actually literal.

1035
01:20:44,765 --> 01:20:55,900
Rym: there's actually this field and we actually destroy all those fields and now you have to And people and you know one of the I could go on forever about like what the end of Ava means and solipsism and humanity.

1036
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:05,497
Rym: But the criticism I hear most about the end of Evangelion is people will say it's pretentious It's a cop-out and it doesn't say anything that hasn't said before.

1037
01:21:05,537 --> 01:21:05,899
Rym: You know, what?

1038
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:12,440
Rym: Very little that has ever been written or shown Says something that no one's ever said before.

1039
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:17,760
Rym: You don't tell me that you're Gurren Lagann or your cowboy bebop said something unique and special.

1040
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,297
Rym: But Ava is just saying things people said.

1041
01:21:19,317 --> 01:21:20,503
Scott: but yeah Well, I mean think of it.

1042
01:21:20,785 --> 01:21:26,852
Scott: pretty much every idea that there is to have was thought up by you know Philosophers in Greece and such a lot.

1043
01:21:26,892 --> 01:21:28,160
Rym: Anyway, that argument is bullshit.

1044
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:34,920
Rym: Yeah, but second to that the argument the unstated argument the beg to question is that Ava does not say it.

1045
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:35,685
Rym: Well, you know what?

1046
01:21:35,786 --> 01:21:36,752
Rym: I'm not gonna mince words.

1047
01:21:37,215 --> 01:21:37,860
Rym: You're wrong.

1048
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:43,040
Rym: Ava says this more eloquently than most have and more repetitively.

1049
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:50,668
Rym: It says everything it says multiple times and it says it with such artistic grace and with such style.

1050
01:21:51,011 --> 01:21:54,731
Rym: and I got to admit I Will put the end of Ava.

1051
01:21:54,933 --> 01:22:06,405
Rym: and when I say the end I mean the clapping the suddenly the notice how the music in the background slowly fades in and it's you know the opening theme Cruel angels thesis.

1052
01:22:06,445 --> 01:22:07,609
Scott: Well, it's a piano version, right?

1053
01:22:07,629 --> 01:22:09,677
Rym: Yes, but it is that theme and you know the lyrics.

1054
01:22:09,697 --> 01:22:21,412
Scott: you've seen that opener 26 times man that you know, that song is a song I've heard a billion times in my life like a billion right and they play it all the time and anime Conventions and social nights and all sorts of things.

1055
01:22:21,472 --> 01:22:23,460
Scott: right and you know, it's a good song.

1056
01:22:23,782 --> 01:22:26,899
Scott: But I got tired of it after a while and it didn't really have anything for me.

1057
01:22:27,221 --> 01:22:36,108
Scott: Right when I started watching the show again, I would actually watch the opener Because you know, it's a good song, you know, you know, even though I heard it a million times.

1058
01:22:36,228 --> 01:22:36,950
Scott: It was getting a little old.

1059
01:22:38,171 --> 01:22:40,378
Scott: That song fucking pumps you the fuck up.

1060
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,346
Scott: it's like oh shit and the thing is cruel.

1061
01:22:43,467 --> 01:22:44,088
Scott: angels thesis.

1062
01:22:44,129 --> 01:22:50,030
Rym: watch out This is a beautiful example of the show Making a point very very artistically.

1063
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:58,946
Rym: I think those last few minutes of the last episode of Ava are some of the most well-constructed and subtle moments in any show I've ever seen.

1064
01:22:59,026 --> 01:23:10,941
Rym: and I Will say I think the end of Ava where the glass cracks and that music plays and ever, you know Amedetou, Amedetou, thank you is Right up there with the end of Cowboy Bebop.

1065
01:23:11,062 --> 01:23:14,495
Rym: It's it's amazing Absolutely amazing.

1066
01:23:14,576 --> 01:23:17,290
Rym: and think about all that's going on there Shinji.

1067
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:19,217
Rym: He is brought to a head.

1068
01:23:19,539 --> 01:23:21,245
Rym: and the moment he's brought to a head.

1069
01:23:21,586 --> 01:23:25,430
Rym: He starts to talk He starts to take form, you know, all the things that you see all the imagery.

1070
01:23:25,911 --> 01:23:27,777
Rym: The imagery is very important and means a lot.

1071
01:23:28,178 --> 01:23:31,789
Rym: and then the music starts playing and the music is the opening scene.

1072
01:23:32,391 --> 01:23:38,090
Rym: The the music that you heard at the beginning of the show the very first thing about Ava that opening theme.

1073
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:46,301
Rym: You know the lyrics at this point and now they're playing an instrumental version of the song But they're playing it in a different manner from for the instrumental version.

1074
01:23:46,361 --> 01:23:50,875
Rym: notice how despite the fact that the song is scary There's a lot of major chords.

1075
01:23:50,955 --> 01:23:52,920
Rym: It's a fairly upbeat melody.

1076
01:23:53,722 --> 01:23:55,046
Rym: and now you hear that.

1077
01:23:55,086 --> 01:23:57,409
Rym: and but when you see the opening You know the opener.

1078
01:23:58,471 --> 01:24:07,530
Rym: It's set with this very very disturbing imagery and the lyrics are Very very deep and not at all what you expect from this upbeat song.

1079
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:18,517
Rym: But then now that you know what the show was saying You know what it's about and you hear this in the background just before that glass cracks the lyrics take out a whole different meaning and The show does that thing of.

1080
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:26,010
Rym: it doesn't play the lyrics for you It doesn't beat it and show you the lyrics and make you say say what the lyrics are saying.

1081
01:24:26,653 --> 01:24:39,368
Rym: It plays the song quietly in the background and you yourself Think back and remember the song and you remember young ball who shines brighter than anyone else rise to become a legend and everything that that song was really about.

1082
01:24:39,389 --> 01:24:41,435
Rym: and Then that glass cracks.

1083
01:24:41,656 --> 01:24:44,570
Rym: and once again the first time I saw that I got choked up.

1084
01:24:44,931 --> 01:24:50,832
Scott: That is an amazing thing about just the name of the song right cruel angels Thesis.

1085
01:24:51,093 --> 01:24:52,839
Scott: that that's what the show is cruel angels.

1086
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:53,922
Scott: and then a thesis boom.

1087
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:56,070
Scott: How could you be right come on?

1088
01:24:57,751 --> 01:25:00,341
Rym: Well, I think I had more analysis than that.

1089
01:25:00,401 --> 01:25:01,626
Scott: Yeah, what you gonna do?

1090
01:25:01,826 --> 01:25:02,308
Scott: What you gonna do?

1091
01:25:02,409 --> 01:25:02,770
Scott: That's right.

1092
01:25:02,871 --> 01:25:04,260
Rym: I'm gonna say all my analysis.

1093
01:25:04,421 --> 01:25:04,884
Scott: That's right.

1094
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:08,859
Rym: But I Did I mean basically I'll put it this way.

1095
01:25:08,939 --> 01:25:11,430
Rym: I hear a lot of people talk a lot of hate about Evangelion.

1096
01:25:12,372 --> 01:25:19,257
Rym: I have never seen anyone put forth what I would consider an Intelligence and backed up argument.

1097
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:20,220
Scott: Yeah, what is like?

1098
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:20,962
Scott: what do people say?

1099
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:23,170
Scott: They're like, it was right dangerous.

1100
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:26,581
Scott: They don't actually have any specific arguments to back that up.

1101
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:33,804
Scott: They'll just be like they'll say something vague right like Oh, it was trying to say all this stuff, but it was just confusing and weird.

1102
01:25:34,025 --> 01:25:35,610
Scott: Oh, it was just a crazy guy.

1103
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:39,170
Scott: Oh, it was just this they don't actually specifically point out.

1104
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:42,341
Scott: Well, you see this in the show was you know bad for this?

1105
01:25:42,381 --> 01:25:43,144
Scott: and this reason?

1106
01:25:43,324 --> 01:25:46,355
Scott: because if you actually looked at the show It's all good.

1107
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:47,739
Scott: It's not anything bad.

1108
01:25:47,779 --> 01:25:48,582
Scott: You can say no.

1109
01:25:49,224 --> 01:25:50,208
Scott: Well, maybe this side.

1110
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:50,910
Scott: It's not perfect.

1111
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:52,870
Rym: No, it's not perfect, but nothing's perfect.

1112
01:25:53,012 --> 01:25:59,089
Rym: but I'll say this if You listen to this and it and you disagree with us and it's been a while since you've seen Ava

1113
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:00,116
Scott: watch it again

1114
01:26:00,519 --> 01:26:06,450
Rym: watch Ava again because I Feel a lot more positively about the show having watched it again

1115
01:26:07,111 --> 01:26:07,432
Scott: Partly

1116
01:26:07,472 --> 01:26:12,669
Rym: because seeing it when you're young I guess maturity makes the show make a lot more sense.

1117
01:26:13,614 --> 01:26:21,310
Rym: Being older being wiser having lived longer Makes the show a lot more poignant because you've lived a lot.

1118
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:35,682
Rym: You'll watch the show when you're 14, and I'm not like that but violin robots awesome when you're 25. when you're 35 you know you look back on your life while you're watching the show and you realize that While you can't identify with everything these kids.

1119
01:26:35,702 --> 01:26:37,249
Rym: do you can?

1120
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:51,365
Rym: identify to a very very strong degree with a lot of the ideas that are presented in this show and a lot of the darkness and a lot of the feelings that the characters express and the ideas and the show is incredibly poignant and amazing.

1121
01:26:51,486 --> 01:26:58,650
Rym: and if you Watch Ava again, and you still think it's a bad show I defy you to argue that point at all.

1122
01:26:59,392 --> 01:27:06,594
Scott: Yeah, I who I who has actually tried to say I mean some people have said they don't like it or whatever They think it's.

1123
01:27:06,634 --> 01:27:11,070
Scott: you know way over hyped or something like that and you know what I think you're wrong.

1124
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:12,635
Scott: Well the show does.

1125
01:27:12,675 --> 01:27:14,442
Scott: you know the show a lot of ways.

1126
01:27:14,763 --> 01:27:28,970
Scott: you know is there's a lot of people who are fans of it because they're fans of you know like Oscar and right hand ties biggest argument I hear against Ava is arguments against fanboys about Ava not arguments against Ava arguments against fanboys and their interpretations.

1127
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:30,754
Rym: Yeah, forget interpretations.

1128
01:27:31,035 --> 01:27:34,804
Rym: look at cinematography look at soundtrack look at message look at artistry.

1129
01:27:35,165 --> 01:27:37,110
Rym: the show is so amazingly put together.

1130
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:41,670
Scott: There is a whole phenomenon of people who their opinion.

1131
01:27:42,332 --> 01:27:47,950
Scott: They can't separate their opinion of a work of art from the opinion of that work of art of others.

1132
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:55,440
Scott: So it's like they have you know cowabeebop, but now suddenly cowabeebop is popular So it's no longer cool, or there's Evangelion?

1133
01:27:55,741 --> 01:27:59,496
Scott: well if it was just me and Evangelion and no one else in the world I would love it, but you know what?

1134
01:27:59,536 --> 01:28:02,190
Scott: because there's a million perverted fanboys who want to see naked ray.

1135
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,050
Scott: I don't like Evangelion anymore.

1136
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:06,220
Scott: Well, that's that's that's.

1137
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:07,144
Scott: it's a bad way to be.

1138
01:28:07,646 --> 01:28:08,450
Scott: cuz you're missing out.

1139
01:28:08,831 --> 01:28:13,128
Rym: I'm gonna state my opinion absolutely unambiguously and argue all you will.

1140
01:28:13,148 --> 01:28:22,070
Rym: I Feel that Shinseki Evangelion stands out among art and among works of fiction and among television shows.

1141
01:28:22,852 --> 01:28:29,770
Rym: It stands apart as one of the greater television shows ever made straight up without any reservation or qualifications.

1142
01:28:30,932 --> 01:28:32,678
Scott: Try to think of a better TV show.

1143
01:28:32,758 --> 01:28:33,200
Scott: it's it's.

1144
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:34,364
Rym: it's gonna be rough.

1145
01:28:34,384 --> 01:28:36,170
Rym: you could argue cowboy bebop.

1146
01:28:36,371 --> 01:28:37,997
Rym: It's close, and I'm you know I'm.

1147
01:28:38,178 --> 01:28:40,286
Rym: we're sticking to anime examples because it's Wednesday.

1148
01:28:40,306 --> 01:28:41,310
Rym: We're talking about anime.

1149
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:51,037
Scott: Yeah But even if I try to think of non anime TV shows that are better just in any genre in any way just overall Quality score on that

1150
01:28:51,098 --> 01:29:01,356
Rym: level like in terms of artistry in terms of how well it's put together I put Ava the show in the same league as like the Godfather which I think is one of the Most perfect movies ever made.

1151
01:29:01,376 --> 01:29:03,243
Scott: it's definitely like number one or two movies.

1152
01:29:03,363 --> 01:29:04,247
Scott: The is the Godfather.

1153
01:29:04,267 --> 01:29:05,150
Scott: number one easily.

1154
01:29:06,212 --> 01:29:11,217
Scott: Yeah, I can't I can't think of it so that We're deep in this LCL.

1155
01:29:11,739 --> 01:29:13,467
Rym: We're out here in these dangerous waters.

1156
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:16,995
Rym: I Defy you Rebut us really.

1157
01:29:17,136 --> 01:29:18,159
Rym: I don't think you can.

1158
01:29:18,179 --> 01:29:24,330
Scott: yeah, and even if you hate all that shit How could you not like robots punching aliens in the face?

1159
01:29:25,492 --> 01:29:30,010
Rym: Now because there's the one thing that Ava does not do that big O does so much better.

1160
01:29:31,292 --> 01:29:39,230
Rym: If there was ever a show that exemplified robots punching robots in the face or nay Anything punching anything in any capacity?

1161
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,374
Rym: Big O is Number one.

1162
01:29:42,394 --> 01:29:45,930
Rym: it is the king of the genre of something punching something.

1163
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:53,213
Scott: Yeah, that that I'm not saying it isn't but I'm saying Ava has plenty of punches to satisfy the punch likers The punch band.

1164
01:29:53,876 --> 01:30:00,069
Rym: oh, and if you wanted to listen to this show expecting us to explain what Ava was about We could we kind of did a little bit.

1165
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:04,473
Rym: Yeah, but I mean it figure goes pretty straightforward cuz I think it's all pretty obvious not good We're not going to.

1166
01:30:04,554 --> 01:30:13,984
Scott: all you had to do to know what Ava's about is to actually try to figure out What the characters want mostly mostly what the bigger more secretive characters want.

1167
01:30:14,105 --> 01:30:18,209
Rym: very simply look at the show and think What is Gendo after?

1168
01:30:19,091 --> 01:30:20,214
Rym: What is Sele after?

1169
01:30:20,234 --> 01:30:21,738
Scott: they're obviously after something.

1170
01:30:21,978 --> 01:30:25,247
Scott: they're not just doing all this stuff for no reason right.

1171
01:30:25,267 --> 01:30:26,290
Rym: what is Kaji after?

1172
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:29,015
Rym: Why did Sele do what they did?

1173
01:30:29,156 --> 01:30:31,082
Rym: Why is Sele at odds with Gendo?

1174
01:30:31,102 --> 01:30:31,864
Scott: What did they do?

1175
01:30:32,406 --> 01:30:32,606
Rym: Why?

1176
01:30:32,647 --> 01:30:33,770
Rym: Yeah, why did Gendo?

1177
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:35,798
Rym: Why did Gendo not want the spear to be there?

1178
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:38,270
Rym: Why was he at odds with Sele and vice versa?

1179
01:30:39,073 --> 01:30:44,230
Rym: it's all pretty straightforward and Maybe someday we'll do a little like special like a 10-minute.

1180
01:30:44,491 --> 01:30:46,278
Rym: Here's exactly what happened and what Ava was about.

1181
01:30:46,298 --> 01:30:47,724
Rym: but the show's not about that.
