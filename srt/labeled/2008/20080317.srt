00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,548
Rym: It's Monday March 17th.

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:12,451
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:15,260
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:18,679
Rym: Scott talks about what computer programming languages are.

5
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:26,919
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,655
Rym: You know my car I'm not gonna.

7
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:46,390
Rym: I'll say this openly because if any police officers listen to this show and Happen to be police officers in a jurisdiction that covers me You're probably cool enough to not come after me or even care because we did something illegal.

8
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:51,958
Rym: I've done something illegal Continuously sin for about seven months now.

9
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:52,840
Scott: What do you been doing?

10
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,087
Rym: I've been driving an uninspected car.

11
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:57,470
Rym: Oh good job Yeah, but I did look it up.

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,610
Rym: The fine is like 20 bucks if they catch you and you have to go get the inspection which I renewed my car on time.

13
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:04,474
Scott: Thank you very much.

14
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:07,590
Rym: Well, the reason I didn't was that the last time I renewed my car.

15
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:18,746
Rym: I've told this story before but I went to the mechanic some shady mechanic and Yonkers cuz near my work back then and I was Hey, I need an inspection and he says you want me to actually inspect it or you just want the sticker.

16
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,815
Rym: and I said Yeah, and he inspect.

17
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:24,760
Rym: I told him to really inspect it and it passed.

18
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:30,458
Rym: but I know my front shocks are shot Mm-hmm, they're completely shot.

19
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:34,130
Rym: All right, but then again, I don't know exactly what it takes to pass a New York State inspection.

20
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:35,736
Rym: Nope, so I took my.

21
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:36,580
Scott: you could look it out.

22
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:39,090
Rym: Yeah, I don't know much about cars either.

23
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:57,888
Rym: I remember but way back when my front right control arm bushing was broken and I knew what a bushing was And I think I knew what a control arm was but I wasn't quite sure what the front right control arm bushing was and I tried to look under my car and I didn't even I Couldn't even tell what was broken and the guy was like, yeah, I have to fix this.

24
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,590
Rym: But then I learned what it was like, oh, okay, and it made sense.

25
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:07,010
Rym: I'm glad I got it fixed but my car is a lot of minor problems and I took it and I'm like it's kind of old.

26
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:16,334
Rym: I decided alright, my deal is unless it's a new car I'm gonna go find some shady mechanic because a shady mechanic who is certified and Gets business.

27
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:16,475
Rym: Yeah.

28
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:24,630
Scott: Yeah, if you inspect cars in New York You have to put this metal sign on your mechanic shop in plain view that says we are certified to inspect cars.

29
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,313
Scott: And this is big.

30
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:27,905
Scott: they got a big yellow sign and the big green sign was.

31
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:33,370
Scott: they say different things But if you see those signs on a building you can get your car inspected there.

32
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:44,181
Rym: Yep, now beyond all that pretty much what I've learned throughout my life is that you don't want to go to a scuzzy looking mechanic But you want to go to a kind of rough-and-tumble looking mechanic.

33
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:52,644
Rym: because those are the people who if they're still in business It means they know enough about cars to keep getting business And two people like that tend to be a lot more resource or they

34
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:56,623
Scott: have to be a great Location where the cars break down all the time like

35
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:57,950
Rym: the shitty one in Yonkers.

36
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:00,450
Rym: Yeah, but I needed to get this inspection.

37
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:11,250
Rym: So I looked in beacon and there's a bunch of you know mid-range not not scuzzy look and just you know Kind of like rough-and-tumble looking mechanics and I just picked one randomly the one that was in the most convenient location.

38
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:18,570
Rym: Mmm, and let me tell you that lady in there is one of those like badass mechanics and those kinds of mechanics.

39
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:19,905
Rym: Just a little hint for all you out there.

40
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,990
Rym: We'll always find a. they will tell you what it will cost to do fix something the quote unquote right way.

41
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:30,809
Rym: But they'll also tell you how to fix it the clever cheap way Which usually involves getting parts from salvage for an old car.

42
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:32,295
Scott: That's not a bad way to go.

43
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,805
Rym: old car for any car older than like four or five years.

44
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:35,970
Rym: That isn't a special car.

45
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:40,382
Rym: That's the way to go because a salvage switch is no different than a new switch.

46
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:40,964
Scott: Yep.

47
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:47,406
Rym: Anyway, she Come in and remember I think because it was kind of a low-income area for a long time.

48
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:51,726
Rym: I was like, all right You know, I go in I go back and I'm like, so what's the damage?

49
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:52,370
Rym: What'd you find?

50
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:59,650
Rym: And she's like, well I had to fail your inspection and I got some bad news and I'm thinking shit The shocks are shot that would cost so much to replace.

51
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,981
Rym: I'm just got to throw the car away and buy a new one like this week.

52
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:02,845
Rym: God damn it.

53
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,433
Rym: And she's like Everything's fine.

54
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,000
Rym: Except all these little things.

55
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:11,556
Rym: I fixed all those for free cuz whatever I'm like, okay and then that's also the cool thing.

56
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,726
Rym: mechanics like that will totally fix minor stuff for free cuz it's.

57
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:18,600
Rym: it's like I Replaced the light bulb on the back of your car.

58
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,125
Scott: Yeah pay me for the light bulb.

59
00:04:20,245 --> 00:04:22,836
Rym: light bulb cost a nickel I'm not even gonna charge you.

60
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,202
Scott: sometimes are $2.

61
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:25,226
Rym: It depends on what kind of car?

62
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:26,010
Rym: what kind of light bulb?

63
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:28,227
Rym: You want that fancy light bulb or not?

64
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:31,737
Rym: Well Yeah, but she doesn't.

65
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:33,142
Rym: apparently I was missing a lug nut.

66
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:36,716
Rym: All right, and she showed me like yeah What the fuck did my lug nut go?

67
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,830
Rym: All right, I'm gonna take it and then she's like, but yeah the bad news.

68
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:52,989
Rym: It's gonna have to cost about a hundred and sixty dollars to replace the headlight switch because I can't find a Sunfire even close to yours in any salvage yard in this County.

69
00:04:53,451 --> 00:05:00,697
Rym: Yeah to which I thought wow, my car must be pretty reliable and to 160 bucks, whatever.

70
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,990
Scott: Yeah, it's like, uh, all right, that's damage.

71
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,182
Rym: I don't think that's damaged pretty much as long as a car continues to run.

72
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:11,379
Rym: if you own it any repair There's less than a thousand dollars that's gonna last.

73
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,190
Rym: at least a year is worth it compared to buying a new car.

74
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:20,317
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you don't care about having a newer car you guys you're willing to keep driving the old jalopy go nuts Plus.

75
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:21,609
Rym: it works as old a job.

76
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:26,755
Rym: It goes pretty damn well, and there's nothing wrong with it Except that one thing.

77
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:33,142
Scott: the thing is when you really think about it, you're paying a hundred and sixty dollars Instead of paying a $20 ticket, you're better off.

78
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,408
Scott: Just knowing the $20 ticket.

79
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,640
Rym: See the problem with that is that all right $20 ticket.

80
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:44,778
Rym: Also if I'm in an accident with an expired inspection It'll be real hard to claim no fault.

81
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:47,406
Rym: Even if I'm not a fault because I have a car that's not legal.

82
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:51,537
Rym: Yeah, and Whenever my Registration is due.

83
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:53,828
Rym: I can't renew it without a valid inspection.

84
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:54,250
Scott: That's true.

85
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:00,540
Rym: Also, and you only need the expansion inspection once a year or every two years Do you need the registration every two years?

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,701
Rym: Yeah action every one year, man I remember in Michigan the registration lasts like five years.

87
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:05,947
Rym: the license lasts like 20 years.

88
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,106
Rym: My Michigan license still says it's valid.

89
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:09,670
Scott: great.

90
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:27,824
Rym: Anyway, I got that out of the way because that's pretty much the good thing that we have to talk about this morning because you see Getting up this morning It was a normal day going to work and I get on my train and I noticed that there's a freaking lot of people on the train and they're all wearing green and some of them are drunk.

91
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:33,539
Rym: and I'm note that I take a 532 Express train into the city a.m.

92
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,202
Rym: Right.

93
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:36,850
Scott: Yeah, did it cause any problems or was it just loud and annoying?

94
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:45,890
Rym: It was very very crowded To the point that it took a long time to get people on the train and my train got into the city like 20 minutes late.

95
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,920
Scott: See I took the 744 train.

96
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:54,728
Scott: I wanted to take the 728 but I slept And the 744 was ten times worse than that.

97
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,658
Scott: Basically, I saw at the train station.

98
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:00,227
Scott: I can't tell if they were college or high school.

99
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:02,690
Scott: if they were college They were the most immature college kids ever.

100
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:11,856
Rym: Oh I ran into a bunch of high school kids carrying around like a Tool leader that looked like it was full of coke and like I don't know some kind of liquor and they're all passionate around anyway Obviously 14.

101
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:13,670
Scott: they were in the second to last car.

102
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:18,249
Scott: So I got into the last car, you know Cuz I wasn't gonna run around to the front of the train or anything, you know.

103
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:23,586
Scott: and They basically everyone else is like they would look into that car and say I'm not going to that car.

104
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:28,943
Scott: as a result You had this entire train car full of rowdy punk kids.

105
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:31,210
Scott: I don't know if there was alcohol or whatever.

106
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:32,338
Rym: So there was.

107
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:33,869
Rym: I can say some of them.

108
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,790
Scott: I think there was like smoking going on in the vestibule.

109
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:43,690
Scott: It was it was out of control and basically the conductor is fed up with that shit and they were getting rowdy and whatnot.

110
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:47,586
Scott: So he stopped at Croton Harmon and was like I'm calling the police.

111
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:48,630
Scott: This train isn't going anywhere.

112
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:53,119
Rym: That would totally be worth it.

113
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:54,789
Rym: just to see the comeuppance.

114
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:59,762
Scott: yeah, and basically all that happened is some people went over and got on the.

115
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:06,850
Rym: the nice train that you know was like if my Train ever stopped in Croton Harmon and I was going into well the train was gonna stop there anyway.

116
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,590
Rym: Yeah, but if it like stopped there and there's any problem I would totally get on those other trains.

117
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:11,590
Rym: Well, the trains are great.

118
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:15,270
Scott: The other trains are real nice, but they it was gonna make a bunch of stops before Grand Central.

119
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,773
Rym: Well, it depends.

120
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:18,610
Rym: there are some of those that are expressed from Croton to Grand Central.

121
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:23,750
Scott: Yeah, but not at the same, you know, basically this train is an express from Croton to Grand Central.

122
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,326
Scott: So why would they have another Croton Grand Central Express leave at the same time?

123
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:32,078
Rym: It's almost worth it though I mean if Amtrak is first-class and Metro North normal is coach.

124
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,967
Rym: Those are like second-class right there.

125
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:34,730
Scott: Yeah, they're okay.

126
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:42,169
Scott: But yeah, and I was already on the later train so I didn't wanna you know But I stayed on there cuz I was in my nice safe car in the back.

127
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,850
Scott: But yeah, the those rowdy kids got some comeuppance.

128
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,849
Scott: But as soon as that train pulled into Grand Central those rowdy kids got rowdy again.

129
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:59,062
Scott: Well, and then on the way home They were they there was still some rowdy ness and there was like a drunken fireman on the train and you can still lose stuff going on.

130
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,308
Scott: and I just got home.

131
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:05,699
Rym: and Yeah, there were a bunch of troubles on my train on the way home But they didn't involve me and I just sat there with my laptop.

132
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:08,710
Scott: So yeah, I was just like God these people God.

133
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:12,182
Rym: But the worst thing was I around lunchtime like man, I'm hungry.

134
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,450
Rym: And again, I forgot about this holiday.

135
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:20,614
Rym: So I just walk out of my building and I want Indian food and the only Indian place really near my work is in Grand Central.

136
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:21,503
Scott: good job.

137
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,270
Rym: So I go in there.

138
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:32,876
Rym: It's a pretty good place and I go down and pretty much there is basically a large sea of people in green loud Drunk spilling things.

139
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,305
Rym: I saw someone vomiting just in the middle of Grand Central.

140
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:38,117
Rym: It's like all over the floor I ran into.

141
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,083
Rym: I watched the police.

142
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:40,329
Scott: I like to go to work today?

143
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,794
Rym: Apparently not.

144
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:44,450
Scott: Hey everyone everyone in my work went to work today.

145
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,973
Scott: It's everyone.

146
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:47,530
Scott: I had one co-worker went to play golf, but everyone else is at work.

147
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,330
Rym: Well, everyone in my work went to work today, but that's because the stock market is very interesting.

148
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,519
Scott: Currently playing golf is Scottish not Irish.

149
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:54,583
Scott: So it's the wrong holiday day.

150
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:55,406
Scott: Yes.

151
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,960
Rym: Yes, it is Scotland Island.

152
00:09:58,363 --> 00:09:59,449
Scott: Yes more Island.

153
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,295
Rym: Anyway, yeah, st.

154
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,079
Rym: Patrick's Day.

155
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:11,630
Rym: I mean, I think kid the only like st Pat when I was a kid st Patrick's Day was I wear a green shirt to school or everybody fucking punches me because everyone's jerks.

156
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:13,140
Scott: I didn't do anything on st.

157
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,804
Scott: Patrick's Day ever.

158
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:14,710
Rym: I wore a green shirt.

159
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,153
Rym: That was it.

160
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,349
Rym: I didn't do anything until high school when I didn't do anything.

161
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:20,682
Scott: But yeah, I really think the problem is we.

162
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,870
Scott: we take a commuter train, you know, it's a people.

163
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:25,962
Scott: They want a nice quiet trip to work and home.

164
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:27,307
Scott: They want it to be fast.

165
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:28,914
Scott: They want to sleep They want to whatever.

166
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:42,264
Scott: but the train is allowed to be used by all, you know Including people on day trips and it's always day trip tourists people in groups who use the trainer like the second most common people To use the train if they use the train in a weekend, whatever.

167
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:43,450
Scott: It's the weekend train, right?

168
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,794
Rym: Yeah, we're pretty rowdy on weekend.

169
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,665
Scott: But if they use the train on the weekday, right?

170
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:50,395
Scott: It's like whoa You're the commuters are here.

171
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:50,876
Scott: You need to.

172
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:57,017
Scott: I really think they should that if there's like some sort of weekday group They should sort of like designate them to.

173
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,230
Scott: you know far away from the commuters or somehow that's crazy.

174
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:02,677
Scott: Like this is the quiet car.

175
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:05,209
Scott: absolutely no talking on this car whatsoever something like that.

176
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:06,096
Rym: You know what?

177
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:08,090
Rym: I've noticed the conductor's usually just deal with it.

178
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,370
Rym: I mean like on the on the trains going home.

179
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,740
Rym: Usually they everyone's kind of talking and it's kind of loud.

180
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,930
Rym: it like that's super loud, but it's not like silent.

181
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:19,290
Rym: But in the morning the conductor doesn't even announce the stops because he knows no one cares.

182
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:25,989
Rym: Yeah, and a lot of times some of the cars have the lights off and they're not supposed to be off But obviously they were just turned off because people kind of want that.

183
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:33,970
Rym: Yeah, and if someone's like even talking quietly the connector be like sir, you need to be quiet Yeah, and they kind of just deal with it, but I mean you can't really segregate.

184
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,810
Rym: There's like the airlines all the people who cause problems on the airlines and people who don't fly off it.

185
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,150
Scott: Yeah, they should have family flights and business flight.

186
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,122
Scott: They're trying to do that in some entirely separate flights instead of separate sections.

187
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:47,432
Rym: Yes, because I'm sure that is economically viable Why not?

188
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:49,117
Rym: and also a good idea.

189
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:52,968
Scott: the family fights just be less often the family fights will be flights.

190
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,118
Rym: Yes I disagree with you.

191
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,103
Scott: I think it's a good idea.

192
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:57,007
Rym: I don't think it's a good idea.

193
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:57,630
Rym: freedom of transportation.

194
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,981
Rym: Besides I'm willing to put up with a tiny bit of annoyance.

195
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:04,355
Rym: plus, you know what I have earplugs There is it's.

196
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:07,430
Rym: you know how much it takes to actually bother me.

197
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:10,202
Scott: Oh, yeah, the earplugs protect me from plenty of noise.

198
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,187
Scott: It's that you know.

199
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:16,364
Scott: people Running up and down the train bumping in you possibly barging on you.

200
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,327
Scott: That's that's the truth.

201
00:12:17,347 --> 00:12:18,110
Rym: Did any that happen?

202
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,432
Scott: Someone else?

203
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,826
Rym: it happened because if it happens the conductor deals with it.

204
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:30,210
Rym: Yeah It's hard to conductors versus like a whole car full of rowdy kids Yeah, but all they have to do is say well we've stopped and here come the police.

205
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:32,077
Scott: Yeah, it didn't do much.

206
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:32,960
Rym: I've been on a few trains.

207
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,442
Rym: The conductor will just like suddenly come out and say Effectively to anyone who has luggage on the seats removed here.

208
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:41,430
Rym: I'm kicking you off the train as soon as I see you.

209
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,225
Scott: Yeah, the other problem is it's like alright, you've got a whole car.

210
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,490
Scott: that's seemingly rowdy, right?

211
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,938
Scott: How do you know who is you know?

212
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:51,790
Scott: What if someone was sitting quietly and everyone else is being rowdy?

213
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:54,196
Rym: I've seen conductors do this.

214
00:12:54,437 --> 00:13:00,140
Rym: They look in from the vestibule and they make note And then they identify those people when the police come.

215
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:02,090
Rym: I've seen that exact thing happen many times.

216
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:03,583
Scott: It's conductor procedure.

217
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:08,623
Rym: actually though the funniest thing was that most of the people on my train home didn't have tickets.

218
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:14,081
Rym: Wow didn't understand how it worked and Pretty much the conductor went person by person.

219
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:17,436
Rym: the conductor be like, uh, sorry Do you have a ticket is like no how much is it?

220
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:20,390
Rym: and she'd be like however much which is always some ludicrous amount.

221
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,494
Scott: It's like 30 bugs.

222
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,650
Rym: they check on this crazy surcharge if you don't have a ticket and you pay and especially on a peak train.

223
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,390
Scott: Yeah, you're supposed to buy tickets to the machines.

224
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:33,010
Scott: You can buy the ticket on the train But it costs a whole shit ton extra and most of the people didn't have money.

225
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,480
Rym: A lot of them didn't have IDs.

226
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,970
Rym: they wanted to pay with credit cards.

227
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:37,257
Rym: They balked at the price.

228
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:39,450
Rym: few people were like, I can't pay what are you gonna do?

229
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,556
Rym: Could I just like kick you off the train?

230
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:46,346
Rym: Yeah, as soon as we get to Croton Harmon Yep, and if I can identify you really make a note so we see you.

231
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:49,600
Rym: if you ever come again Yep, and the guy's like, uh, what do I do?

232
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,110
Rym: and she's like get off the train quietly in Croton Harmon.

233
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:52,974
Rym: Hope I don't notice you.

234
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:53,797
Scott: Yeah.

235
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,409
Rym: The thing is the conductors will always cut you a break if you're not a jerk Yep.

236
00:13:57,812 --> 00:14:04,943
Rym: So all people who ever come to New York City if you screw up on the train Just be polite and they will totally cut you a break.

237
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,089
Rym: That is my advice to you.

238
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:07,015
Scott: Yeah, you know what?

239
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:08,466
Scott: I did you read that milestones thing?

240
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:08,969
Scott: They give up.

241
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:10,943
Rym: I read that every time because it's always.

242
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:11,950
Scott: did you read what it said?

243
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:16,365
Rym: I always read it because it always is very kind of snarky in its seriously.

244
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:17,990
Rym: people be quiet in the morning.

245
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:20,769
Scott: Well, did you did you see what it said in the most recent one?

246
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:23,678
Rym: I'm not sure to what you're referring about the.

247
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:28,960
Scott: they're actually gonna give the conductors like handheld gizmos instead of the paper They've been using for a hundred years.

248
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,109
Rym: Oh, yeah, and I think that's cool.

249
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,982
Rym: Yeah I was gonna wait till it happened and then I was gonna talk about it.

250
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:33,646
Scott: now you can pay.

251
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:42,090
Scott: you're probably gonna be able To pay with a credit card on the train instead of you know Punch a holes in a piece of paper and give you a piece and then file it in the office.

252
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:46,443
Rym: I'm really looking forward to that to be honest because that's like such a good idea.

253
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:47,466
Scott: Yeah, it is.

254
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:48,068
Scott: It's.

255
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:49,534
Scott: I'm surprised It wasn't implemented.

256
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:52,770
Scott: I don't know to five years ago when that technology was invented.

257
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,170
Rym: I don't even care about the paying part.

258
00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:09,200
Rym: What I like is that now they'll get perfect accurate statistics of who is going where not just going to Grand Central But a lot of times they don't really know who is taking what trains when who's getting off at all those kind of in-between Stops when because a lot of a lot of like.

259
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:16,110
Rym: if you want to go from some stations to other stations Like when I was commuting to the Bronx from here, it's almost impossible.

260
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:22,941
Rym: But yet a lot of people do it and now they'll know exactly how many people do it And I think the train schedules are gonna become ten times better.

261
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:23,402
Scott: Maybe.

262
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:25,589
Scott: All right, let's break through all these bunch of newses.

263
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:26,272
Scott: All right.

264
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:26,835
Rym: All right.

265
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:28,243
Rym: So, uh, what do you got first?

266
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:29,630
Rym: You see there's so much to talk about.

267
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:32,262
Rym: We both have a real news and a quickie news.

268
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:33,910
Scott: Well, here's my is my quick news.

269
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,698
Scott: Actually, I could talk about this a lot but basic I'm not going to.

270
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:42,448
Scott: there's a company called Japan steelworks limited And that has to be an awesome fucking place, right?

271
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,641
Rym: It's like heavy industry right there.

272
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:45,970
Scott: That is the heaviest of industries.

273
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:51,910
Scott: basically It's a giant steel mill in Japan where they make like the world's best steel or close to it.

274
00:15:52,291 --> 00:16:01,410
Scott: And at the top of the mountain, there's a guy in an old-fashioned hut and he makes Swords right like the old-school way.

275
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:09,277
Scott: He makes awesome swords with their best steels for sword making but down in the steel mill is where the news is at Because I just wanted to point that out.

276
00:16:09,297 --> 00:16:12,490
Scott: so, you know that it's the same steel mill that's making swords is making this.

277
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:15,269
Rym: Well, no that guy in the top actually makes those things by hand.

278
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,416
Scott: Yeah, but he doesn't make the steel.

279
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:19,180
Scott: you take the deal.

280
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,567
Rym: I was saying the thing that you're about to talk about.

281
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:29,950
Scott: Oh, no In fact, no No He does not make in the steel mill down at the bottom of the hill where they do not make swords.

282
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,390
Scott: So they make big things very big things.

283
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:34,595
Scott: They have a factory.

284
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:45,243
Scott: that is the only factory on the entire earth that is capable of Producing the core of a nuclear reactor in one solid piece.

285
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:51,530
Scott: every place else that makes nuclear reactor cores Makes two pieces that are half and half and then welds them together.

286
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:55,134
Scott: Now you might say oh well, you know What's why is that a big deal?

287
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:59,890
Scott: because it's a bajillion times safer than having the two separate pieces welded together.

288
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:06,950
Scott: So basically everyone who was building a nuclear reactor, which is hundreds and hundreds right is buying these things.

289
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:10,498
Scott: and the thing is They have to put down.

290
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:13,289
Scott: Well at first they can only make for a year.

291
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:20,994
Rym: So if a hundred people want them you're gonna be waiting a while, you know, that makes me realize, you know The enormity of the task.

292
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:23,042
Rym: I'm afraid from this point forward.

293
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:24,569
Rym: We can only make four gig nights a year.

294
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:25,949
Rym: We just can't really hand it.

295
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:30,366
Rym: Yeah, and two well, it would be if we did not edit.

296
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:35,946
Scott: like some people people who want these things Because there's only four a year.

297
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:45,495
Scott: They have to make a down payment of a hundred million dollars and this is considered like a sure bet like a like a great Investment like oh, of course.

298
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:46,940
Scott: Why wouldn't you spend 100 million dollars?

299
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,590
Scott: It's obvious for one big piece of metal.

300
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:52,790
Scott: So yeah, I think just think that's pretty amazing.

301
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:59,318
Scott: and I think if you read this article it talks about how they make the 600 ton ingot of steel and such.

302
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:07,197
Rym: and think about how normal that I said enormity twice for a reason 600 ton ingot 100 million dollar deposit.

303
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:13,120
Rym: Yeah, I put a five dollar deposit on my car repair.

304
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,226
Scott: I mean you go to a chip factory whatever.

305
00:18:15,406 --> 00:18:17,512
Scott: still look at that Business.

306
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,900
Rym: yeah, I mean even tiny steel mills are awesome.

307
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,422
Rym: Imagine.

308
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:23,150
Rym: I'd love to see videos of just all the stuff.

309
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:29,759
Scott: I don't think they would let you in because then that would reveal the secret to the rest of the world and suddenly everyone be Making one piece nuclear reactor cores.

310
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,562
Rym: Yes, I'm sure.

311
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:31,024
Rym: Yeah.

312
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:36,185
Rym: Alright, so my quick I make one in my backyard my quickie news real briefly.

313
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,149
Rym: I just want to point this out.

314
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:39,756
Rym: According to some article this linked on slash shot.

315
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:44,167
Rym: It appears that six and only six botnets are responsible for approximately 85% of the world's spam.

316
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:55,770
Rym: I might have a lot to say about that but I think we should wait and do a show on botnets and spam or something like that because It would take a lot much more than the news.

317
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:02,530
Rym: But I have to point that out because there are debates along the lines of why don't we make secret evil?

318
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,021
Rym: Viruses that screw anyone who is infected by these botnets thus saving the internet.

319
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:10,593
Rym: Hmm, and there's a lot of any reasons why no one does that.

320
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:28,809
Rym: but I I just want to point this article out because If you're computer running windows and you think that your windows is fine and safe and there's nothing wrong with it You might want to double-check with some sort of third-party Firewall checking your own traffic.

321
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,567
Scott: You might want to get someone who knows something to check because obviously you don't because a large.

322
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:40,230
Scott: if you know how to check Then I can guarantee you you're safe because you know, but you might think you know and not know.

323
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:41,396
Rym: So, how do you know?

324
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:44,049
Rym: if you know or you just think you know you get someone who really knows.

325
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,662
Rym: But what if they just think they know then you're fucked.

326
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:48,912
Rym: or you could just ask us I don't know.

327
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,559
Scott: only you can only trust us cuz we know.

328
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,495
Scott: yes only I can only trust someone who is who is very Intelligent.

329
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:58,650
Rym: but what if we only think we know we know?

330
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,941
Rym: The thing is there's almost no way to tell.

331
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:04,749
Scott: there's an easy way to tell.

332
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,037
Rym: yes External outbound firewalls.

333
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:10,549
Scott: the wireshark can easily tell wireshark and eyeballs.

334
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:11,998
Rym: Well wireshark can tell.

335
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:14,170
Rym: but what if your TCP IP stack is compromised?

336
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:23,868
Rym: You can use the another computer with wireshark with a yes Like I said external monitoring external outbound monitoring is the only way to know.

337
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,194
Rym: Yes So now you know.

338
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:27,263
Rym: and if you thought something else you didn't know.

339
00:20:27,403 --> 00:20:28,488
Rym: and now you know that you didn't know.

340
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:29,974
Rym: and now you know That you know, yeah.

341
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:33,789
Rym: Anyway, you know, you know, so I got a real news here.

342
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:49,018
Rym: So, you know, there's been this problem lately with the FCC kind of not saying what their regulations are but then suddenly someone says fuck on the airwaves and $100,000 fine your network's gonna be shut down.

343
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:49,621
Rym: all this business.

344
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:55,243
Rym: the FCC has wide and broad powers and Some of those wide and broad powers are important and I agree with them.

345
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:56,730
Rym: and some of those powers.

346
00:20:57,312 --> 00:21:02,790
Rym: I'm of the mind that the FCC should have absolutely no regulation whatsoever over the content of what is on the airwaves.

347
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,696
Rym: I think that's that's they show.

348
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:22,330
Rym: but they should have full power to regulate how the airwaves are used exactly as in protocols as in companies having the right to use or not use them with such power and whatever as if people are preventing Shared technology spaces such as radio frequencies from working.

349
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:24,578
Scott: Then the FCC can step in.

350
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:31,269
Scott: if someone is using them for things which are legal Then they got it doesn't matter as long as they're not fucking it up.

351
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:35,728
Rym: There have been a whole bunch of Controversies and a whole bunch of problems with this in the u.s.

352
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:36,010
Rym: Lately.

353
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:50,521
Rym: I mean you might remember what happened at a Super Bowl a while ago, and there have been other incidents, but All the networks that have balls have basically stood up and challenged all these things And there have been a bunch of lawsuits going around because they

354
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:53,068
Scott: want porn on primetime TV And I'm all for it.

355
00:21:53,411 --> 00:22:00,039
Rym: Or maybe it's more that they don't like the fact that an entity over which they have no say and no control Can.

356
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,190
Scott: well they have saying control.

357
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,099
Scott: They just send lobbyists with lots of money to say in control.

358
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:08,030
Rym: remember the FCC is largely independent of other governmental structures.

359
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,181
Scott: Yeah, but you can still send people with money over there and get what you want.

360
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:14,412
Rym: not so much you have not on paper I remember.

361
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:22,219
Rym: the FCC generally follows the guidelines put forth by a Ridiculous minority of the American population.

362
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:30,245
Rym: yeah pretty much and this minority actually has very little Lobbying power when compared to the lobbying power of the entertainment industry.

363
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,716
Rym: you get the entertainment industry Industry people like.

364
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:38,028
Scott: it's very hard to tell because you read the news right and you see news about different things.

365
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:39,316
Scott: you see news about sports.

366
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:42,077
Scott: you see news about Entertainment industry.

367
00:22:42,097 --> 00:22:44,715
Scott: you see news about you know banks.

368
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:47,382
Scott: you see news about Technology industry.

369
00:22:47,443 --> 00:22:54,149
Scott: right it But it's hard to tell because you sort of get the idea of how big things are based on the quantity of news.

370
00:22:54,169 --> 00:23:09,390
Scott: like you See lots and lots of entertainment news and that sort of makes entertainment feel big, but if you really look at the numbers like Technology industry like Microsoft could buy probably the entire entertainment industry like all of it like every movie studio Microsoft could buy them all.

371
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,619
Scott: Probably it's that that's the size.

372
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:23,169
Rym: We're talking about him yep, but regardless This really came into stark relief here when there was a this problem where the FCC changes policy on so-called Bleeding expletives.

373
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:36,753
Rym: The biggest example was when someone at the Golden Globes three years ago caught five years ago Uttered didn't even say outright, but just uttered the phrase, and I'm gonna quote here fucking brilliant Mm-hmm.

374
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:46,279
Rym: and the FCC said well the f-word when used in any context is quotes Inherently sexual and connotation unquote.

375
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:48,365
Scott: all right even if it is what's wrong with that?

376
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:54,293
Rym: even beyond that Fuck you has no sexual connotations.

377
00:23:54,514 --> 00:24:02,782
Rym: with me saying it now it means that I rather dislike you that I'm blowing you off that I disagree even if it does have Sexual connotations, what's wrong with sexual connotation?

378
00:24:03,164 --> 00:24:05,172
Rym: ah ah well apparently I don't even know.

379
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:20,079
Rym: but the problem is the FCC has they changed their policy saying that they can enforce and Fine as a result of any network allowing expletives that are fleeting To be put forth to be on the airwaves?

380
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:28,210
Rym: and they protested this and a court said well You didn't really say why you changed your policy, and you didn't make your policy clear.

381
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:34,773
Rym: So your policy can't be enforced until you come forward with something and now they're appealing it And it's going all the way to Supreme Court.

382
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:36,616
Scott: Oh, it's the case of the century.

383
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:40,176
Rym: so the Supreme Court is Going to.

384
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:42,130
Scott: did they say yes, or did they just say no?

385
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:48,930
Rym: Well quote the Supreme Court on Monday stepped into a legal fight over the use of curse words on the airway.

386
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,615
Scott: Oh, what did the previous court say?

387
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:53,003
Rym: all the previous court was the court that said.

388
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:55,090
Rym: I already said, that's okay.

389
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,877
Scott: So the previous court was on our side.

390
00:24:57,017 --> 00:25:00,310
Rym: yes, okay, and they appealed it all the way to SCOTUS, okay?

391
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,487
Scott: But if SCOTUS says we don't want to look at that then we win.

392
00:25:02,507 --> 00:25:10,690
Scott: well I believe the news Scott as I pointed out was that they said they're going to look at well That's usually bad because that means there's a chance of losing whereas if they said no there'd be no chance of losing.

393
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,799
Rym: However, I'd rather them look at it.

394
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:15,430
Scott: well if they look at it, and then we still win.

395
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:29,249
Rym: That's like double-plus yes, and if they look at it and they rule otherwise I've learned that I now disagree with the Supreme Court on such a fundamental level because to paraphrase Seinfeld Freedom of speech and religion is the first one.

396
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:31,798
Scott: It is indeed so.

397
00:25:31,818 --> 00:25:45,992
Rym: the case will actually be argued in the fall and This in my eyes is other than maybe the whole Torture thing is probably the most important Supreme Court case to be put forth in Recent memory.

398
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:49,728
Scott: this is going to be the most important case until we have the wiretapping case.

399
00:25:49,989 --> 00:26:00,450
Rym: yes I want to point out that The wiretapping case you know a lot of people say oh the government can't do anything about that because blah blah blah blah blah Blah blah blah, and this is not big news yet.

400
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:12,650
Rym: But I point out that last week the house had a secret session for the first time in like two decades Which means that they're gonna debate something secret and obviously it was that and they voted to not give immunity.

401
00:26:13,094 --> 00:26:16,256
Scott: It really seems like you know lately I mean like.

402
00:26:16,316 --> 00:26:16,677
Scott: I don't know.

403
00:26:16,717 --> 00:26:26,370
Scott: maybe I just paid attention to the Supreme Court less earlier in my life But it seems like the Supreme Court like it's like every case is like the new case of the century.

404
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,676
Scott: It was like the Grokster case.

405
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,625
Scott: This is the public domain case.

406
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:31,558
Rym: there were a bunch of cases You didn't care about.

407
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,650
Scott: I know there were a bunch I didn't care about but it does seem like there's just it's.

408
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,155
Scott: Case after case.

409
00:26:37,215 --> 00:26:39,390
Scott: every case is bigger and badder than the previous one.

410
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,829
Scott: I think like in five years is gonna be a case like so crazy It'll be like should we end the world or not?

411
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:53,445
Rym: Well, I think the reason if a case gets to the Supreme Court It has to be the case of the century because that means that no not always.

412
00:26:53,506 --> 00:26:55,353
Scott: a lot of them are sometimes Just small.

413
00:26:55,413 --> 00:27:02,556
Rym: things are relatively small means they're so contentious that it has become a federal possibly Constitutional issue.

414
00:27:02,878 --> 00:27:14,121
Rym: we need the people who have the most authority possible to come down and deign to say what actually is going to be and No one can do anything about it except Andrew Jackson.

415
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:15,607
Rym: Yeah, and he's dead.

416
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:18,796
Scott: He's dead All right, so check this out.

417
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:22,590
Scott: I'm not exactly sure like I heard about this news on a podcast, right?

418
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,292
Rym: How great.

419
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,797
Rym: some guy on the internet love to it.

420
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:28,310
Rym: and well now you're hearing about this on a podcast that heard about it.

421
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:30,657
Scott: Well, they didn't hear about it from a podcast.

422
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:31,500
Scott: I heard about it from to it.

423
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:39,050
Rym: no, you're hearing about it from us And that podcast heard about it from.

424
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:44,417
Scott: So because I decided I wanted to talk about it I had to look for the article and I don't know.

425
00:27:44,437 --> 00:27:46,906
Scott: maybe I just couldn't find the article but I found.

426
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,295
Scott: basically it seems like Twit made up a news.

427
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:55,573
Scott: That was the combination of two other two articles that Man Regardless.

428
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:57,097
Scott: basically twit said.

429
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:58,622
Scott: this is what twit said to.

430
00:27:59,123 --> 00:28:09,978
Scott: it said that some Chinese company Made like routers and switches that were fake and put the word Cisco on them Sold them to the US but they had back doors in them.

431
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,710
Rym: now one buying a bootleg Cisco router with all the functionality unlocked.

432
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:17,177
Scott: Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

433
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:19,244
Rym: selling an awesome Cisco router.

434
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:23,035
Rym: That's obviously bootleg with everything unlocked Along with a back door.

435
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:24,118
Rym: brilliant.

436
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:27,590
Rym: Yes brilliant again, like my head is off to everyone involved.

437
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:30,178
Scott: Well, except for the morons.

438
00:28:30,198 --> 00:28:32,089
Scott: You don't realize they bought a router with the back door.

439
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,816
Scott: Like buying a router without a back door.

440
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:35,238
Scott: brilliant.

441
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:37,084
Scott: buying a router with the back door.

442
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:39,191
Scott: if you can find the back door and seal It up.

443
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:40,716
Scott: double brilliant God.

444
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:42,623
Rym: We just need someone to make an open-source router.

445
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:43,305
Rym: That isn't awful.

446
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:46,797
Scott: Yeah anyway anyway In looking for this news.

447
00:28:46,857 --> 00:28:48,384
Scott: I found actually two other stories.

448
00:28:48,425 --> 00:29:02,287
Scott: The first story is That there were bootleg routers made from China and sent to the US and Canada and that they confiscated bootleg routers Seventy million dollars worth of Cisco systems networking equipment.

449
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:02,910
Scott: That was bootleg.

450
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:04,829
Rym: I was right problem.

451
00:29:06,032 --> 00:29:10,606
Rym: If I was using it for my own use I wouldn't be that opposed to a bootleg router if it worked.

452
00:29:11,028 --> 00:29:11,249
Rym: Yeah.

453
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:18,050
Scott: Then I read another story that's basically says that PC Pro news in the you in the UK.

454
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:26,410
Scott: Right, I Said that it would be possible for Asian manufactured switchers and routers to have back doors.

455
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:28,219
Scott: I should watch about that.

456
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:28,681
Rym: that.

457
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,350
Rym: that see it's funny.

458
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,740
Rym: that sounds like a subtle change like it happened to.

459
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:38,037
Rym: it could happen but no that turned a Real article into nothing more than FUD.

460
00:29:38,057 --> 00:29:46,567
Scott: and basically what I'm linking to here is an editorial by a guy on CNET Who says that that FUD is xenophobic and bla bla bla bla bla bla fuck you.

461
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:48,193
Scott: granted I agree with that guy.

462
00:29:48,213 --> 00:30:04,370
Rym: if I were in China making bootleg Cisco routers in order to sell and make a gigantic profit You can bet you can Absolutely bet that there would be some sort of VPN back door credit card numbered password getting thing in there.

463
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,597
Scott: But that would be true for me.

464
00:30:05,658 --> 00:30:15,413
Scott: making bootleg routers in any country Yeah, the fact that they were specifically being all racist against you know, the Asians who are known for their bootlegs There is no doubt.

465
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,519
Rym: but well, mostly China Korea.

466
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:23,549
Scott: Yeah, you know what I'm on the Southeast Asia mostly China Yeah, and the Philippines, but you get you get the drift here.

467
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:32,629
Scott: so The I haven't found yet a news article that shows that these two things have actually been combined into a true story.

468
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:34,919
Scott: But there are two separate things.

469
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,050
Scott: They're interesting and they're worth thinking about.

470
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:51,224
Rym: You know what a much better way to go about this if you are a Chinese bootlegger instead of going the whole I'm gonna make fake Cisco stuff sell it and put it back door in is I'm going to take the Cisco stuff sell it, but I'm not gonna call it Cisco.

471
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:52,990
Rym: I'm gonna call it sasco.

472
00:30:53,271 --> 00:30:54,599
Rym: I'm gonna call it something sorry.

473
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,008
Scott: Oh, yeah, we'll go down to.

474
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:02,469
Scott: We'll go down to canal Street and right next to the verse H will be the sascoes.

475
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:05,522
Rym: It's a. it's a verse edge Disney cross over.

476
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,210
Scott: the guy will set a cross on the side.

477
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,179
Scott: I'll set up a table on the sidewalk.

478
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:15,160
Scott: He's like 24 foot switches 24 foot $10 with load balancing and a picks firewall.

479
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,490
Rym: I'll throw in a picks firewall picks firewall free without every purchase.

480
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:27,089
Rym: but what I would do is I'd make my own brand and I just it would happen to just be bootleg Cisco software and bootleg Cisco designs.

481
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:33,009
Rym: But I'd stand by my brand as in my brand is totally not full of bag doors.

482
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:40,319
Rym: Yeah, so that people are going to go buy bootleg Costco's are Totally gonna buy my bootleg Costco's.

483
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,350
Rym: and also now Cisco can't get me for trademark infringement.

484
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:46,724
Rym: They can only get me if they prove that I'm using their software.

485
00:31:46,744 --> 00:31:48,070
Scott: We should be hard.

486
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:50,370
Scott: Yes, I don't think they even know what software they're using.

487
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:55,508
Rym: All I'd have to do is change some checksums here and there and oh man, oh man.

488
00:31:55,569 --> 00:31:57,051
Scott: Yep Exactly.

489
00:31:57,071 --> 00:32:03,048
Rym: So if I were a Chinese large-scale pirate, that is what I would do.

490
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:06,949
Rym: Yep Wow, we just killed that hole if I was a pirate episode.

491
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:28,073
Rym: Alright Rym if you tried if you ever tried one of those digital to-do lists in the past I had a PDA once and I put to-do lists on him On it and then I never looked at that to-do list again ever.

492
00:32:28,374 --> 00:32:30,300
Scott: Yeah, you know I get it's weird.

493
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,806
Scott: It's like you.

494
00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:35,340
Scott: there's all these productivity tools and they seem sort of obvious, right?

495
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,228
Scott: But you end up not really using them.

496
00:32:37,268 --> 00:32:41,527
Scott: like Google Calendar is the only one I've kind of used But I don't really like.

497
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:42,933
Scott: I don't live by it like.

498
00:32:42,973 --> 00:32:44,199
Scott: I use it a little bit.

499
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:52,798
Rym: I just Google Calendar and things like that to remind me like Does this convention overlap with this other convention before I try to do events at both of them?

500
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:53,360
Scott: It's weird.

501
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:05,199
Scott: It's like they have these tools designed where you can like live by them like a like a day planner like the day runner products or something, you know, and I feel like That's like a thing you need to have or do but I never.

502
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:08,328
Scott: Every time I try one, I don't I might.

503
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:11,417
Scott: you know, I had calendars that I just never used.

504
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:20,529
Scott: the Google Calendar I do use but I only use it a bit Like I. I feel like I should be using it hardcore like putting everything in there and but I feel like that would take more time.

505
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:25,385
Scott: it would just be a waste of time because I don't forget to do anything and Like I just don't do it.

506
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:28,520
Scott: and the same thing is a to-do lists like that.

507
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:33,020
Scott: You know, I've had to-do lists in the past and I sort of use them and not use them.

508
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:36,079
Rym: I just remembered when I first got my new moleskine.

509
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:40,720
Rym: I put a to-do list in there and I realized I haven't looked at my moleskine in a long time.

510
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:44,825
Rym: Yep, let's see what I got in here Email katsu-kan about panels.

511
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:47,772
Rym: did it email uncle yo about katsu-kan?

512
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,677
Rym: did it make an archival feed?

513
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:50,238
Rym: I didn't do that.

514
00:33:50,258 --> 00:33:50,659
Scott: didn't do that?

515
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:53,107
Rym: Make C's.

516
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:54,016
Rym: I don't even know.

517
00:33:54,056 --> 00:33:59,220
Scott: but anyway I also did it to-do list of my moleskine and I kind of use it a little bit.

518
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:09,077
Scott: You know sort of like the same way as the Google Calendar like I don't live by it But I sort of use it some you know, and I look through it and I'm like, oh right I forgot about that thing, you know.

519
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:16,780
Scott: And sometimes like I'll come up with an idea and if I remember to write it down real quick then even if I forget that Idea later, it'll be in there and I kind of like that.

520
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:23,580
Rym: Yeah what I have used like things like that for is like whenever I'm in a bookstore if I see a book that I want I Write the name down in my notebook or something.

521
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:33,300
Rym: I see things I like useless doll for that, you know, like when I'm in the bookstore And I see a book Yep, and then I come home and I put it in Amazon and I buy it because it's always cheaper that way.

522
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:38,059
Scott: But anyway, if you're that kind of person, right I found here a is it?

523
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:42,159
Scott: you know There's a billion to-do lists on the on the web, you know, like oh we have a to-do list.

524
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,512
Scott: We have one, you know, there's one I found called.

525
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:50,150
Scott: Remember the milk remember the milk calm It's got this happy cow and he's kind of cute there.

526
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:56,199
Scott: and this to-do list Actually looks like it might have the potential to be a real to-do list.

527
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:59,580
Scott: It integrates if you have you know, Windows Mobile.

528
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:00,889
Scott: It works with that go.

529
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:03,022
Scott: Google Calendar works with that Got.

530
00:35:03,062 --> 00:35:05,491
Scott: an iPhone or an iPod touch works with that got.

531
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:06,716
Scott: Twitter works with that got.

532
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:07,660
Scott: Gmail works at that.

533
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:10,069
Scott: It works with all your stuff.

534
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:12,900
Scott: It just integrates and it's a happy awesome to-do list.

535
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,247
Scott: This is how web applications need to be made people.

536
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:25,020
Scott: All right, you know, I was dealing today with like I You know Twitter pounce and jaku and I was trying to sort them all out and none of them was good.

537
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:30,020
Scott: They all sucked in some way and we're all good in some way and it was horrendously annoying.

538
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:31,487
Scott: But remember the milk.

539
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:34,199
Scott: even if it's you know, you don't end up living by it.

540
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:37,592
Scott: This is a to-do list where it's not a problem in the software.

541
00:35:37,632 --> 00:35:41,480
Scott: if you're not, you know using it to the fullest It is the high quality.

542
00:35:42,022 --> 00:35:46,940
Rym: So I had a much more meaningful thing of the day something I generate some discussion about.

543
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:52,907
Rym: I'll save that maybe for a Thursday, but instead This video.

544
00:35:52,947 --> 00:35:54,155
Rym: there's a small chance.

545
00:35:54,235 --> 00:36:02,680
Rym: It was staged But I would believe that it isn't because I have seen people do things this dumb and I know video using.

546
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:03,402
Rym: I've.

547
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:07,433
Rym: I've witnessed people in actual workplaces doing things like this.

548
00:36:07,693 --> 00:36:10,140
Rym: All right, dudes taking a spool.

549
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:13,019
Rym: They got to get it up into another part of it.

550
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,584
Scott: I don't think everyone knows you mean by spool.

551
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:20,360
Rym: All right a spool of cable as in it's like five or six feet in diameter.

552
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:27,982
Scott: It's real heavy think a spool of thread but with giant heavy cable wrapped around it and it's big like as big as you Like.

553
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:32,258
Rym: the kind of thing a college kid will steal with when there's wired gone from it and make a table out of.

554
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:39,260
Scott: it's the kind Of thing you see on like the phone company truck with cable wrapped around it You know big wooden discs with a cylinder in the middle.

555
00:36:39,622 --> 00:36:43,000
Rym: Well, these guys have constructed some sort of ramp to get these things up.

556
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,474
Rym: It looks like they're probably wiring this building for connectivity.

557
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,600
Scott: Why did they use an elevator?

558
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:47,764
Rym: There's a lot of reasons for that.

559
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:56,657
Rym: a lot of buildings make the mistake of not having service elevators if they're small buildings not in cities and then it's like normal elevators just can't deal with stuff like that.

560
00:36:56,677 --> 00:37:04,260
Rym: or The elevators were broken or they wouldn't fit in the elevator or that floor was like a mezzanine that isn't supported by elevators.

561
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:06,188
Scott: It looks like it was sort of an open Lobby.

562
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:08,760
Scott: They could have used one of those like, you know lifting things.

563
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,380
Rym: Nah, how do you want how do you get that in the lobby?

564
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,840
Rym: You have to construct it in there because obviously there's no big way into that Lobby anymore.

565
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:16,910
Scott: Yeah, and also there will be soon.

566
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,120
Rym: Yeah, and also a lot of times like the floor.

567
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,531
Rym: There's a lot of reasons why they were poorly designed building.

568
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,580
Rym: There are a lot of legit morons.

569
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:26,452
Rym: No, there are a lot of legitimate reasons why I would be doing something like this.

570
00:37:26,492 --> 00:37:32,441
Rym: However, there are certain Safety precautions you take to do this sort of thing Safely.

571
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,771
Rym: these people did not take those precautions.

572
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:42,340
Rym: What results is nothing more than sheer Absolute hilarity bonus points when the car alarm starts going off.

573
00:37:42,641 --> 00:37:43,985
Scott: Yeah, that was like.

574
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:48,220
Scott: it's like you see some damage done from morons and then you there's like this two-second pause.

575
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,713
Rym: You're like, wow, and then there was more damage.

576
00:37:50,754 --> 00:37:51,940
Scott: That was off-camera.

577
00:37:53,422 --> 00:37:54,527
Rym: Like did it hit a car?

578
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:55,994
Rym: and sure enough you get to see.

579
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,180
Rym: yes it hit a car.

580
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,048
Scott: It was much off-camera damage.

581
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:00,234
Rym: I've no one got hurt.

582
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:04,300
Rym: So I don't feel bad about watching it Just laugh at the morons or the poorly designed building.

583
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:13,137
Rym: No the morons because the building there might have been a lot of legitimate reasons for what they were doing But when they designed the building they designed a stupid not necessarily there.

584
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:13,920
Rym: I don't want to get into this.

585
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,693
Rym: Yeah, there are a lot of legitimate reasons for doing what they were doing.

586
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:17,999
Rym: I don't think so.

587
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:18,601
Rym: Yes I've.

588
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:22,460
Rym: the only problem here is that they were doing these things in an unsafe manner.

589
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:23,999
Rym: There's a safe way to do that.

590
00:38:24,582 --> 00:38:28,980
Scott: You could have just kept the spool on the bottom floor and taking cable off of the spool as needed it.

591
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,489
Rym: No, that's really really inefficient.

592
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,298
Rym: All you do is have a winch at the top and you secure the thing.

593
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:34,600
Rym: That's it.

594
00:38:34,881 --> 00:38:36,720
Rym: Yeah, it's all you had to do anyway.

595
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:40,669
Scott: So I got to talk about programming again, right?

596
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:41,170
Rym: Yeah go now.

597
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,994
Rym: It's I'm gonna play Layton.

598
00:38:42,335 --> 00:38:42,857
Scott: Oh great.

599
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:54,340
Scott: So last time I talked about what is programming right and you know, I talked a little about that and Basically programming is you tell the chip what to do, right?

600
00:38:55,381 --> 00:39:09,141
Scott: But the next thing I was gonna talk about was programming languages and I was gonna go over like, you know Some of the big very popular programming languages of today and the past and talk a little about what each one does and how they're Different.

601
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:18,308
Scott: but I realized something I can't go talking about programming languages yet until I talk about What is a programming language?

602
00:39:18,468 --> 00:39:21,777
Rym: So we're not gonna have the what's better visual basic or see we're not.

603
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:22,940
Scott: there's no such thing.

604
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:29,520
Scott: No language is better than any other language unless you have a specific situation in mind.

605
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,020
Rym: I would argue that some languages are overall worse.

606
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,610
Scott: But well some languages can be less useful can all?

607
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:42,930
Scott: there are some languages that are always less useful than some other languages for every Possible situation but that you know, they're not like a worse language.

608
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,096
Scott: That's that's just not a valid kind of.

609
00:39:45,377 --> 00:39:46,500
Rym: I can submit a worse language.

610
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:50,238
Rym: I made it right now Anyway, it doesn't even work.

611
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:52,551
Rym: Anyway, go that's exactly.

612
00:39:52,652 --> 00:39:53,760
Scott: this is what I'm talking about.

613
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,460
Scott: Is that before you understand that kind of argument you have to understand what is a programming language?

614
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,629
Scott: Well a program telling you what a programming language is is very simple.

615
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,200
Scott: a programming language is a language that's used for programming.

616
00:40:05,524 --> 00:40:06,151
Scott: That's that's all.

617
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,926
Scott: there is The heart.

618
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:10,339
Scott: I already told you what programming was last week.

619
00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:14,137
Scott: So the part you don't know is what a language is.

620
00:40:14,217 --> 00:40:18,400
Scott: now you're thinking Oh, I know what a language is like English Spanish French Chinese.

621
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,365
Rym: It's just the thing that tells the computer what to do.

622
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:21,950
Scott: No a language.

623
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:25,600
Scott: and see there's the colloquial use of the word language.

624
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:30,164
Scott: You know English Spanish Spanish French Japanese Canadian right.

625
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:37,729
Scott: and then there's the sort of language theory use of the word language Which is a completely different meaning.

626
00:40:37,769 --> 00:41:00,013
Scott: well actually it isn't super completely different but basically according to the Wikipedia because I couldn't come up with the super exact definition on my own even though I know a Language is a system of visual auditorial Visual auditory or tactile symbols of communication and the rules used to manipulate them.

627
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:07,509
Scott: so you have some sort of Symbology right and there are some rules governing the symbology.

628
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,016
Scott: that is what a language is.

629
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:15,536
Scott: so a programming language is a set of symbols rules governing the.

630
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:18,408
Scott: How do you manipulate those symbols?

631
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,000
Scott: and those manipulated symbols are used to program?

632
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,087
Scott: That is what a programming language is.

633
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:24,930
Rym: well simple.

634
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,351
Rym: We're done.

635
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:25,853
Rym: No.

636
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:29,145
Scott: We're not really done because people have no idea What the hell I just said do they?

637
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:32,960
Rym: some people might but if you do then you don't really you're not gonna learn anything today.

638
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:40,867
Scott: Most likely yeah, all right, so the thing is when someone says okay You know I kind of understand that.

639
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:44,940
Scott: well the next thing what you know every language right you say, okay?

640
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:49,294
Scott: A language is a set of rules governing the use of a set of symbols.

641
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:52,789
Scott: right well How do we describe those rules?

642
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:55,040
Scott: How do I how do I tell someone a language?

643
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,699
Scott: Well if I was gonna tell Rym about a language.

644
00:41:58,543 --> 00:42:01,132
Scott: What those rules are called is the grammar.

645
00:42:01,734 --> 00:42:03,159
Scott: you see oh you see where this goes?

646
00:42:05,462 --> 00:42:14,336
Scott: The grammar yes, so the grammar is basically It's the set of rules that Tell you what the language is.

647
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:17,803
Scott: so Let's say here.

648
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:19,830
Scott: I'm gonna come up with a brand new language right now.

649
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,472
Scott: Okay.

650
00:42:20,673 --> 00:42:30,440
Scott: My language is called a B. That's that's what the name of my language and the alphabet of my language alphabet being a keyword has two symbols.

651
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,694
Rym: You know it's funny that you chose a B because alphabet literally alpha beta a B.

652
00:42:34,794 --> 00:42:35,576
Scott: I know anyway.

653
00:42:35,697 --> 00:42:37,926
Rym: Yes, you see me I see that you're clever.

654
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:38,930
Rym: You're yes.

655
00:42:39,453 --> 00:42:44,509
Scott: Yes, my language Maybe my language a B has an alphabet.

656
00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:45,973
Scott: that alphabet has two symbols.

657
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:51,954
Scott: you see the alphabet is the set of symbols for the language a And B. I hope you know what those are.

658
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:53,182
Scott: I'm not gonna you know.

659
00:42:53,283 --> 00:43:06,905
Scott: and they look like the letter a and letter B for the English alphabet and The way the rules of my language the grammar of my language is thus the language is comprised of Sentences.

660
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:10,588
Scott: all right You can have as many sentences as you want.

661
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:22,138
Scott: all right every sentence must begin with a a can be followed only by either B or the end of the sentence.

662
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:29,604
Scott: every B must be followed either by a B or an A. I Just made a whole new language.

663
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:31,610
Scott: you see that I made rules.

664
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:40,700
Scott: the rules make a language and now we can Take symbols and arrange them and then we can look at those symbols and we can say are those symbols grammatically correct?

665
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,095
Scott: Are they in this language or are they not in this language?

666
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:43,760
Rym: all right?

667
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,560
Rym: So you've got your language, and we know how to form things in the language correctly.

668
00:43:47,741 --> 00:43:48,605
Rym: You know what the rules are.

669
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,173
Rym: so how what what does that get me?

670
00:43:50,676 --> 00:43:51,440
Scott: What does that get you?

671
00:43:51,700 --> 00:44:01,420
Scott: Well you see when you have a language like the English language you see the human brain is Sort of flexi, and it is very has the fuzzy logic and the fusiform gyrus.

672
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:05,022
Scott: Yes as things which computers right now Do not have.

673
00:44:05,704 --> 00:44:12,555
Scott: so if you were to try to speak the English language to a computer which is a valid language It's a language just according to the definitions.

674
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:14,703
Scott: I just gave The computer.

675
00:44:14,723 --> 00:44:18,274
Scott: it'd be very very difficult to make a computer that understood that right.

676
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:31,062
Scott: and like I talked about last week You know the chip in the computer it knows like an assembly language Which is just numbers and then we sort of replace some of those numbers with letters to make it easier to type in but really It's not any different.

677
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:35,236
Scott: It's incredibly difficult for a human to think in the way a machine does.

678
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:36,580
Scott: so I assembly language is difficult.

679
00:44:37,363 --> 00:44:42,340
Scott: So it's incredibly difficult to tell a machine what to do because you have to think the way it does which is hard.

680
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,628
Scott: It's much easier to think in.

681
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:48,108
Scott: you know your native human language But it's very hard for the computer to understand that.

682
00:44:48,931 --> 00:45:03,180
Scott: so what we do in the world of programming is We basically if you made a chip that on the lowest level where the assembly language was easy That ship would be very slow because the assembly language is determined by the actual hardware.

683
00:45:03,722 --> 00:45:06,950
Scott: So we make the hardware where the machine language is very hard.

684
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:16,960
Scott: It's the assembly language right, but then we make another language That's a little bit easier for humans to read and then that language gets translated into assembly language.

685
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:28,599
Scott: you see and we make up these languages we make up grammars for these languages and Then you know we write we talk to the computer in these new languages that we just made up.

686
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,265
Scott: We can make up any language you want.

687
00:45:30,305 --> 00:45:39,452
Scott: we could even make a B into a programming language if we wanted to and then we Arbitrarily decide right because a language the meaning has nothing to do with the language.

688
00:45:39,712 --> 00:45:39,893
Scott: right?

689
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:47,276
Scott: what a means like a bbva End of sentence is a valid sentence in the a B language.

690
00:45:47,557 --> 00:45:48,180
Scott: What does that mean?

691
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,852
Scott: Oh, that's nothing to do with the language what it means.

692
00:45:50,933 --> 00:46:09,734
Scott: we arbitrarily decide what the things are going to mean outside of the language and What we do is we take a grammar we type in our programming language The computer looks at the grammar right it looks at the language And then it says aha that is in this language Or it is not.

693
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:12,209
Scott: if it's not that's how you get the syntax errors you see.

694
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:15,403
Scott: Because he says oh, that's not in this language that doesn't match up.

695
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:21,210
Scott: you put a b a b Which is wrong because a must either be followed by a or the end of a?

696
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:28,003
Scott: B or the end of a sentence and B must be followed by either a or B. So if B is followed by the end of a sentence is no good.

697
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,096
Scott: I Don't know this is getting confusing even for me.

698
00:46:31,517 --> 00:46:34,648
Rym: Don't do what Donnie don't does dude anyway.

699
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:39,679
Scott: Yeah anyway What we do is you make up a language.

700
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:43,210
Scott: the language can be a rules for how the symbols are arranged.

701
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:47,650
Scott: You can arrange the symbols however you want as you know you when you're making up the language.

702
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:58,310
Scott: But once the language is made up you obey the language And then the computer will translate that language according to the arbitrary things you set up, so we decide okay?

703
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:02,839
Scott: Aba that means you know the computer.

704
00:47:02,879 --> 00:47:05,547
Scott: do this and a bba that means computer.

705
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:11,430
Scott: do this other thing and We just come up with a language that is you know a B is hard for people to understand.

706
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:12,630
Scott: You know it's only got two symbols.

707
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,590
Scott: It doesn't mean a lot of stuff.

708
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:23,873
Scott: But if you come up a language like C. We can have things like printf if while do then return You know int x integer All sorts of.

709
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:33,048
Scott: you know things that mean something to a human being and we write rules for how we're going to arrange these things in a structured way that a computer can break them apart.

710
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:47,390
Scott: and Now you can tell a computer what to do in a language that makes sense to humans, but is still structured and According to a grammar that a computer can bust apart, and that is that is sort of a languages.

711
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,803
Scott: I didn't do the bad by planning on how to explain.

712
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:53,570
Scott: that was much better than my execution.

713
00:47:53,911 --> 00:47:56,198
Rym: That's fine because my what is IT was.

714
00:47:56,779 --> 00:48:00,430
Rym: I'm just filling time before I eat a bunch of food.

715
00:48:00,612 --> 00:48:01,810
Rym: Let's just keep trying.

716
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,316
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

717
00:48:03,376 --> 00:48:05,805
Scott: I will clarify more in the form if anyone wants, but here.

718
00:48:05,845 --> 00:48:06,990
Scott: I want to say one more thing though.

719
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:21,499
Scott: No, here's where this kind of stuff gets interesting, and this is the stuff that is like the the complex parts of computer science That you will learn if you go get a CS degree all right, so let's say I Want to write down on a piece of paper.

720
00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:23,430
Scott: right a definition of my language?

721
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,135
Scott: I want to write the grammar down.

722
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:27,422
Scott: if I want to write the grammar down.

723
00:48:27,442 --> 00:48:29,769
Scott: I need to write it in a language don't I?

724
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,990
Scott: So so we have languages for writing grammars.

725
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:39,823
Scott: We have one language in particular called back as an hour form or BNF.

726
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:47,683
Scott: most people just say BNF because back as an hour is hard to say And BNF is a language for writing down grammars.

727
00:48:47,783 --> 00:48:49,107
Scott: It's really not that complicated.

728
00:48:49,128 --> 00:48:50,755
Scott: if you look at it It's it's pretty obvious.

729
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:53,529
Scott: It basically says this this can you know?

730
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:55,675
Scott: This is that and this is that.

731
00:48:55,695 --> 00:49:03,661
Scott: so you can say sentence equals and then after that you put you know the form of a Sentence and then you could even do like sentence equals a number of words.

732
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:06,910
Scott: a word equals a number of you know letters.

733
00:49:07,613 --> 00:49:11,550
Scott: Letter equals a or B or C or D or E or F, and that's English right there.

734
00:49:11,893 --> 00:49:12,054
Scott: You know.

735
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,650
Scott: it's not that complicated.

736
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:19,545
Scott: But what if I wanted to write the grammar of back as an hour form?

737
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:21,090
Scott: because back as an hour form is a language.

738
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:26,769
Scott: So you could actually write the definition of the back as an hour form language in back as an hour form.

739
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:28,886
Scott: Think about that.

740
00:49:30,953 --> 00:49:32,445
Scott: So wait here, we're gonna get crazy.

741
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:32,929
Scott: Are you ready?

742
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,634
Scott: XML is a language.

743
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:37,505
Scott: It's a markup language not a programming language, but it's a language.

744
00:49:37,786 --> 00:49:38,810
Scott: right XML is a language.

745
00:49:38,931 --> 00:49:40,325
Scott: It's the extensible markup language.

746
00:49:40,406 --> 00:49:44,544
Scott: in XML there is a subset of XML called a DTD.

747
00:49:44,624 --> 00:49:47,556
Scott: a document type definition I believe is what it stands for.

748
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:48,740
Rym: I have no idea.

749
00:49:49,182 --> 00:49:50,808
Scott: I think it's a document type definition.

750
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:55,762
Scott: a DTD is a way is a subset of XML.

751
00:49:55,822 --> 00:50:00,217
Scott: so all DTDs are XML but not all XML or DTDs.

752
00:50:01,342 --> 00:50:06,320
Scott: and a DTD is a way of Writing a grammar for a language.

753
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:07,364
Scott: that is XM.

754
00:50:07,444 --> 00:50:09,009
Scott: that is a subset of XML.

755
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:13,890
Scott: so Xhtml for example is also another subset of XML, right?

756
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:21,737
Scott: So I could write the rules for writing Xhtml in a DTD.

757
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:24,810
Scott: in fact there is one you can go look at the rules for X HTML.

758
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:27,228
Scott: There is an X HTML DTD that you can look at.

759
00:50:28,372 --> 00:50:34,907
Scott: That's a set of rules for writing an XML document written in a subset of XML itself, so you can write.

760
00:50:35,509 --> 00:50:35,970
Scott: get this.

761
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:41,270
Scott: You can write a document type definition because DTDs are XML.

762
00:50:42,263 --> 00:50:45,250
Scott: right You can write a DTD for DTDs.

763
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:49,638
Scott: You have XML as a language.

764
00:50:49,678 --> 00:50:56,659
Scott: within that language you have a sub language that can define a Subset of the language so you can define.

765
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,070
Scott: it's it the subset of the language with itself?

766
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,614
Scott: You're writing languages.

767
00:51:02,674 --> 00:51:08,670
Scott: you're using languages to write rules for languages and therefore they can write rules about how to write themselves.

768
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:15,734
Scott: It's totally crazy, and I got an assignment to write the DTD for DTDs once and I didn't do well It was hard.

769
00:51:16,395 --> 00:51:19,183
Rym: man never had to do anything weird like that in IT.

770
00:51:19,203 --> 00:51:20,567
Rym: We're just like here's a router.

771
00:51:21,068 --> 00:51:21,670
Rym: set it up.

772
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:29,230
Scott: Yeah, if you can write if you want to go a real challenge try to write a document type definition for document type definitions.

773
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:30,276
Scott: I'm in fact there is one.

774
00:51:30,297 --> 00:51:31,745
Scott: you can probably just download it on the internet.

775
00:51:31,766 --> 00:51:32,389
Scott: See what it looks like.

776
00:51:32,732 --> 00:51:33,036
Scott: I don't know.

777
00:51:33,076 --> 00:51:39,250
Scott: Maybe I'll find it somewhere, but You know this is the kind of stuff that you know is like the core of computer science.

778
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,474
Scott: You know you have languages.

779
00:51:40,955 --> 00:51:43,282
Scott: It's language theory how languages work.

780
00:51:43,703 --> 00:51:46,130
Scott: You know different language structures.

781
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:48,057
Scott: You know because by restruck.

782
00:51:48,097 --> 00:51:51,408
Scott: This is why we have so many different programming languages.

783
00:51:51,448 --> 00:51:52,898
Scott: you think oh We'll just have one.

784
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,210
Scott: You know we'll just have a handful.

785
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,214
Scott: why do we need so many?

786
00:51:55,656 --> 00:52:02,500
Scott: it's because you can structure languages in so many different ways and It's really it's not about the computer so much.

787
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:04,228
Scott: We you know the computer speaks assembly.

788
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:04,790
Scott: we can trans.

789
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:05,818
Scott: You know we just need to come.

790
00:52:06,342 --> 00:52:15,955
Scott: when you're making a new language You just need to make sure that you can translate it into the assembly somehow somewhere right or you could even translate it into another Language that can then be translated to assembly.

791
00:52:15,996 --> 00:52:19,104
Scott: like Python translates to C translates to assembly.

792
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:22,077
Scott: so as long as I can translate to C I'm okay now.

793
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,809
Rym: You might say that seems silly, but think about it.

794
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:27,223
Rym: It's really a lot easier to write Python than it is to write C.

795
00:52:27,403 --> 00:52:28,608
Scott: Well depends on what you're doing.

796
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:30,400
Rym: well for me It is for non coder.

797
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:37,110
Rym: if I'm doing simple stuff I can get a lot of the performance of things that are written in C, but I only have to write them in Python.

798
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:59,309
Scott: Yeah, so you basically there's this whole science, and it is science is computer science of trying to work out languages working with languages and grammars to come up with languages that are Easy for people to understand and you know are structured in a way that you can use them to get different jobs done.

799
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:20,880
Scott: However, also you need to be able to get computers to understand these languages make sense of them understand them and Translate them into actual real assembly instructions that the chip in the computer you know reads and does something according to that and That's like the core of CS there.

800
00:53:21,102 --> 00:53:22,428
Scott: that that's the hardcore shits.

801
00:53:23,353 --> 00:53:31,130
Rym: Well, if you don't have anything else then I can tell you all that next Monday I'm gonna talk about a IT subject that is near and dear to a lot of people.

802
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:35,249
Rym: We're going to talk about the help desk and what that really is and what its purpose is.

803
00:53:35,691 --> 00:53:40,576
Scott: Those are the most annoyed people at the company and all the morons call them constantly The people.

804
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:45,221
Rym: when your Comcast thing is broken you call these people Everything that goes right.

805
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:45,928
Rym: these are the people.

806
00:53:46,654 --> 00:53:51,137
Rym: they're pretty much the interface between users and People who actually care.

807
00:53:51,157 --> 00:53:53,730
Scott: and the big problem, but I'll talk about it.

808
00:54:00,135 --> 00:54:02,717
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

809
00:54:02,737 --> 00:54:04,938

812
00:54:23,562 --> 00:54:25,732
Rym: Mondays are science and technology Tuesdays.

813
00:54:25,772 --> 00:54:27,540
Rym: We have video games board games and RPGs.

814
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:33,640
Rym: Wednesdays are anime manga comic nights and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

815
00:54:34,101 --> 00:54:38,317
Scott: You can send us feedback by email to GeekNights at front row.

816

823
00:55:14,257 --> 00:55:15,560
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
