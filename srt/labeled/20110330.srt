1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,024
Rym: It's Wednesday March 30th 2011.

2
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:12,464
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:15,428
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:17,350
Rym: comics in digital form.

5
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:22,908
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:31,670
Scott: So on on Saturday going to see this show the the Book of Mormon right by the guys.

7
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,415
Rym: I sadly don't get to go.

8
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:36,907
Scott: I'll have to go next week sometime, but anyway well good luck with good luck getting tickets.

9
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:39,717
Rym: Yeah It's easy to get two tickets.

10
00:00:39,937 --> 00:00:42,486
Scott: not really I had to get the Statler and Waldorf tickets.

11
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:43,470
Rym: That's fine.

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,594
Rym: I don't plan to sit up close.

13
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:45,378
Rym: I save my.

14
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,430
Rym: I'm not sitting in the front row for an untested musical.

15
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:58,290
Scott: Yeah, no, but basically if people were the line basically because I didn't want to buy tickets You know the only way to get them pretty much is to go to the box office physically.

16
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:02,338
Scott: So I go to this box office Which is on the same street as my office how convenient.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,590
Scott: and I wait in this line and the line is pretty much constant length.

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:12,231
Scott: They process people as fast as people get in line, and if the the light the line is the full length of the lobby in The theater.

19
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:15,604
Scott: right it's not a very big lobby, but still it's like a you know 15 20 foot long.

20
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:19,169
Scott: Yeah, the point is this line.

21
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:26,673
Scott: every single person in this line it deserved except for they got two guys behind me a Stabbing in the face.

22
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:28,842
Rym: What could they possibly be doing?

23
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:30,690
Rym: the line is moving what it is not.

24
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:31,976
Rym: Well, so there are two.

25
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:33,121
Scott: there are two ticket windows.

26
00:01:33,463 --> 00:01:34,306
Scott: right all right.

27
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:37,170
Scott: when the time I walked in there was a lady at the left ticket window.

28
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:46,503
Scott: I don't know how long she was there before I got there But she was there at that ticket window at least 10 minutes after I got there And she just kept being like she couldn't figure out a date.

29
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:47,286
Scott: She was like no.

30
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:47,928
Scott: That's a Wednesday.

31
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,535
Scott: It's no good I can't go on Wednesday.

32
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,021
Scott: then like five minutes later.

33
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,186
Scott: She was like okay.

34
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:56,804
Scott: Oh, no wait That's a Wednesday, and I'm like oh my god old people die in a fire.

35
00:01:57,085 --> 00:02:00,021
Rym: right the thing is the problem Here is that there's even a line.

36
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,952
Rym: It's just be online Online.

37
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:06,842
Scott: this is why Broadway.com where I work exists right.

38
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:14,981
Rym: but even even though the one who was like don't go to Broadway Com just buy it in person I would pay whatever it costs to not have to stand in this line.

39
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:22,222
Scott: now knowing the point is is that like even Broadway.com we have troubles because You know these theaters are just so old-fashioned.

40
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,078
Scott: You know but anyway Yeah, it's like.

41
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:27,130
Scott: and then another guy tried two different credit cards.

42
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,254
Scott: They were both denied and someone else was like I want to buy tickets for like November, and I'm like oh my god What the fuck people.

43
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:36,810
Scott: well, and I was just I was like give me can I get four tickets this weekend?

44
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:41,450
Scott: And then even me right I wasn't trying to get you know I was just like any date this weekend.

45
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:42,541
Scott: Give me four ticket.

46
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:44,492
Scott: You know the four tickets Right.

47
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:46,261
Rym: I think you're at the wrong booth for tickets.

48
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:48,130
Scott: Yeah, there's four shows this weekend.

49
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:49,397
Scott: I want four tickets.

50
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,910
Scott: right and he's like well, which of the four shows do you want?

51
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,362
Scott: I'm like I don't care, and he's like well You have to pick one, and I'm like you can't just search all four.

52
00:02:57,463 --> 00:02:57,744
Scott: It's like.

53
00:02:57,784 --> 00:02:59,670
Scott: What is what year is this 1970?

54
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,496
Scott: You know apparently yeah, it's like.

55
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,241
Scott: you know it wasn't just the people in line.

56
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:05,890
Scott: It was also the box-office people meanwhile.

57
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:10,051
Rym: date is that Broadway?

58
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:19,210
Rym: because people know Broadway like out in the wide world There's a lot of tourists, so they will sell out pretty much any popular.

59
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:20,821
Scott: Oh, it's actually bad for tourists.

60
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:22,149
Scott: how to tourists get the tickets?

61
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:30,987
Rym: I know I'm saying the tourists just get in that line because someone tells them to or They go through like their travel agency or whatever and they're like oh, we'll get you theater ticket.

62
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:31,890
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

63
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,056
Scott: It's like it's this big thing.

64
00:03:33,116 --> 00:03:35,106
Scott: if they would just put the tickets on I should know.

65
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:35,810
Rym: but here's the thing.

66
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:42,870
Rym: This is what I'm saying because they have this audience of people who aren't terribly savvy and who have money.

67
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:46,146
Rym: They don't have to upgrade shit.

68
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:52,170
Scott: meanwhile I think it's just because they're their theaters are relatively small and centrally located.

69
00:03:52,270 --> 00:04:03,330
Rym: But then again right you think that you didn't let me finish because when I buy tickets to the symphony Not only is the fee basically negligible to order online, but it's not easy to do it in person online.

70
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:09,670
Rym: Not only can I see all the dates not only can I do crazy complex searches like you know?

71
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:19,410
Rym: I could search multiple days or multiple times or price levels or anything But once I finally settled on something and I pick my seats I can see a view from each individual seat.

72
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,581
Scott: Yep, someone needs to make a system.

73
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:23,330
Rym: You know the thing is God, but you're not listening to me.

74
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:25,579
Rym: There's no incentive to they make the same money.

75
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,030
Rym: either way it would cost more to improve it in any way.

76
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:30,998
Scott: That is where you're wrong right.

77
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:35,190
Scott: the fact is is that Broadway actually doesn't really make all that much money.

78
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:40,850
Scott: Cirque du Soleil makes as much money as all of Broadway multiplied many many times.

79
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,160
Rym: I know that we've had this before but I'm Broadway.

80
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:48,139
Scott: and the thing is a lot of Broadway shows except There's a few shows right that basically sell out forever.

81
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,344
Scott: right because they're the good shows.

82
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:51,250
Scott: they sell out forever because the theaters are small.

83
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,500
Scott: So right, but all the other shows basically just keep.

84
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,590
Scott: you got flops all over the place fail fail close.

85
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,677
Scott: You know how many shows just closed at a point?

86
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:03,790
Scott: recently there were more closed theaters on Broadway than like a long long time.

87
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,372
Rym: So here's the thing.

88
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:05,175
Rym: they're how.

89
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:10,085
Rym: how is online tickets that work going to get more people to go to shows They've never heard of?

90
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:19,409
Rym: Because right there are people argue the in-person one is better because you get you got to get tourists who don't even know what they Want to see have a line that's like I want to see a Broadway show.

91
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:24,290
Scott: Yeah, that's called the TKTS line where the tickets are half-price yet to buy them day of it exists.

92
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,661
Rym: Yeah, so that's it.

93
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:26,609
Rym: How are they gonna make more money?

94
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:29,049
Rym: How are they going to sell more seats to crappy shows?

95
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,854
Scott: Because they're a lot there are.

96
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:34,908
Scott: there's at least some people who don't go simply because it's inconvenient.

97
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:35,350
Rym: think so.

98
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:42,084
Scott: I don't think those all those shows that don't sell enough tickets and go out They would sell at least one more ticket.

99
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:46,090
Rym: by doing it properly It's got one more ticket is not worth any amount of effort.

100
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,310
Rym: You're gonna put in that much effort.

101
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:56,003
Scott: And I said at least one because obviously I don't have any actual numbers, but I I suspect it would be a good Disagree with this.

102
00:05:56,023 --> 00:06:03,337
Rym: for one The popular shows meaning shows where people know the name of it who don't know anything about Broadway I probably do sell out most of the time.

103
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,210
Rym: I mean I even saw reports of spider-man selling out.

104
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,064
Scott: Well, that's just because you know because it has the proper noun.

105
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:10,250
Rym: Yeah, it's like a magic spell.

106
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:17,750
Rym: It's kind of like in Hollywood where every ticket to the Garfield movie was sold Before they made Garfield the movie was the least important part of the equation.

107
00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:18,129
Rym: Yeah

108
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:18,772
Scott: but

109
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:36,114
Rym: there's no way they'll make enough money to warrant any reinvestment because at its core the shows are crappy and If they modernize everything all that means is after maybe an initial rush of people going to the theater who wouldn't otherwise they'll realize those shows are crappy and Most people just don't care.

110
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,680
Rym: There's no way that would make money.

111
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:38,623
Rym: They're better off.

112
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,550
Scott: In fact, I definitely make money.

113
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:54,100
Rym: I would make it even more of a pain in the ass to where people want to get show the tickets to say the Book of Mormon and they can't but they're already in line and I'm like Hey tell you what if you want to go on to a different show on the same day I can get your primo tickets at a discount.

114
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,402
Rym: blah blah blah.

115
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:56,030
Scott: They don't want someone else to go to a different show.

116
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:59,529
Rym: No, those people selling the tickets at the booths do that.

117
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:01,178
Rym: That's what I would do.

118
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,510
Rym: I would have like a tickets line.

119
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,310
Rym: I would upsell at the tickets line to just sell every goddamn ticket to every show in aggregate.

120
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:09,630
Scott: I understand the way the tickets line works, right?

121
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,230
Scott: Is that the box office is of the individual shows?

122
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,530
Scott: The day if it was the day of the show and they have X a bunch of extra tickets.

123
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:24,990
Scott: They physically take those tickets over to TKTS sell them to TKTS and then TKTS sells them for half price or whatever.

124
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:32,756
Scott: So Scott say I'm the basically discount, you know It's like buy a ticket for a show today that no one else was gonna say I'm the guy in charge of I don't know spider-man.

125
00:07:32,937 --> 00:07:40,929
Rym: and spider-man sold out and some family of four tourists comes up to my box Office and it's like we want to see spider-man on this day and it's sold out.

126
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,823
Scott: What if I didn't go to the spider-man box office or the TKTS?

127
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:45,350
Rym: Let's say it's the spider-man box office.

128
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:48,859
Scott: Spider-man box office doesn't want any other Broadway show to make any money.

129
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,742
Rym: Ah, but here's the thing.

130
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:56,389
Rym: if their shows are already sold out Why don't they make a deal with some crappy show?

131
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,752
Rym: To where look?

132
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,922
Rym: we will also like they could upsell just that show.

133
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:07,649
Scott: anyone who comes who tries to buy a ticket to my spider-man They can't even search a whole weekend and you want them to cooperate with other shows.

134
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:10,565
Scott: remember This is a situation where it's old people being stupid.

135
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:16,809
Scott: I don't think it's that The whole thing is run by old people who are morons and old-fashioned he's got.

136
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:17,757
Rym: I agree with you.

137
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:26,618
Rym: But in this case, especially because of the limited size of the theaters and just the the scale of Broadway Which isn't as big as people think very small.

138
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,747
Rym: I just don't think modernization would help.

139
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,773
Rym: I think the problem Definitely.

140
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,183
Rym: Oh, I disagree with you extremely.

141
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:34,750
Rym: But anyway, it's not a Monday show.

142
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:40,802
Rym: So I guess I'll have to do a Monday show on why the person who works at Broadway calm Yeah, I work in the real money factory.

143
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:42,210
Rym: I can tell you that there's no money in it.

144
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,010
Rym: Otherwise it would have been done right but here but yet again, right?

145
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:51,350
Scott: So the money factory though if you were an old-fashioned money factory, how does that make money compared to the modernized money factory?

146
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,120
Scott: Yeah, but my eyes money factory is a lot better, isn't it?

147
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,270
Rym: But Scott that's because there's underlying money.

148
00:08:56,772 --> 00:09:01,830
Rym: I don't think there's enough underlying money in some in theaters that can sell out at such low numbers.

149
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:03,277
Scott: I think they're definitely is.

150
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,870
Rym: they can't just raise the price or not enough people will go.

151
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,300
Rym: I mean the symphony gets away with that.

152
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:12,589
Rym: not that many tickets But it's like 400 bucks a seat and the rich people go and it still sells out.

153
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:14,496
Rym: So they make a lot more money.

154
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:19,874
Rym: if you're gonna try to charge 400 bucks a seat for most of the seats for spider-man It's not gonna happen.

155
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:22,804
Scott: No you charge less and you have more shows.

156
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:24,470
Scott: the symphony only has a few shows.

157
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:27,282
Rym: You realize how hard it is on the actors to do musicals.

158
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:28,950
Rym: There's a reason they don't do more show.

159
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:30,636
Scott: It's your job dude.

160
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:31,438
Rym: Uh Scott.

161
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:31,880
Rym: It's not.

162
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,486
Rym: it's that's like saying yeah, ditch diggers.

163
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:34,770
Rym: Just dig twice as many ditches.

164
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:38,943
Scott: No, it's taking the same number of ditches per unit time.

165
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:41,250
Scott: You're just that you're just going on for more years.

166
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:42,554
Rym: You know why they don't?

167
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:43,919
Rym: because it stops making money.

168
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,809
Rym: or the actors get tired of it or they wear themselves out.

169
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:51,186
Rym: Actually a lot of shows have problems especially shows.

170
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:52,150
Rym: I was a fan of back in the day.

171
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:52,694
Rym: There's this one.

172
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:54,869
Rym: I forget the name of it, but it needed like three male leads.

173
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,230
Rym: So it would always only run for short times because even if they had understudies for all of them.

174
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:08,883
Rym: So six guys who are already like the rare male tenors that can do the parts and it's hard to get you know Multiple tenors in the same show because there aren't that many in the well that says for writing.

175
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:10,650
Scott: that's making the show purposely difficult.

176
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,938
Scott: That's like haha.

177
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:13,990
Scott: Come and see the torture chamber.

178
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:17,883
Scott: My point is this we stab the actors with spikes and flares.

179
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,930
Rym: my point is this you may know about the ticket selling.

180
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:21,810
Rym: I don't think you know anything about the rest of Broadway.

181
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:25,124
Rym: No, I don't think you know anything about what it takes to put out a show.

182
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:40,497
Rym: I know that Having stupid old-fashioned box offices, it's not Substantially, you know who it's hurting Scott you the same way that you got mad because you couldn't buy curtains online because Scott there's no money in it.

183
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,281
Rym: No one gives a shit.

184
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:42,707
Rym: if there's money would happen.

185
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:44,055
Rym: There's money There's no money.

186
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:44,539
Rym: didn't do it.

187
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,136
Scott: if there's so much money in it Yeah, the problem is is a cartel.

188
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:49,039
Rym: How is the?

189
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,461
Rym: so?

190
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:50,906
Rym: there's a cartel on curtains.

191
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:52,030
Scott: knows the cartel on tickets.

192
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:54,516
Rym: Why don't you just make?

193
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:59,034
Rym: I mean if it's so easy make a modern theater somewhere near Broadway Buy one of those warehouses.

194
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,723
Scott: on the west side is a cartel on theaters and digots.

195
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:03,829
Rym: So I'm saying make a new theater.

196
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,662
Scott: Yeah, where am I supposed to get this money?

197
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:07,556
Scott: So What?

198
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:09,450
Scott: what cartel is gonna sell me their theater?

199
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,993
Rym: Apparently if they're not making any money They'd gladly sell it.

200
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:18,897
Rym: if you paid enough and because you clearly have this magic money making if I had the money to begin with I wouldn't invest it in Broadway.

201
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:21,909
Scott: There's better places to invest it maybe because there's no money there.

202
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:31,009
Rym: The thing is Any comic or manga or animation related news.

203
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:34,887
Scott: You decided to hear my opening bit into this giant thing.

204
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:38,673
Rym: You're so wrong Disastrously wrong.

205
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:40,178
Scott: All right, so Rym we should.

206
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:40,720
Scott: they should hand.

207
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,530
Scott: they should study using tickets with you know barcodes on them.

208
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,133
Scott: They should.

209
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:47,410
Scott: they should actually have like hand written little notes that they scrawl.

210
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:51,468
Scott: They should hand them out only, you know on the second moon of the.

211
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:55,845
Rym: yes That's a real nice straw man that you're making right there.

212
00:11:56,228 --> 00:12:01,221
Scott: nice Because they would sell the same number of tickets.

213
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:02,870
Scott: it doesn't matter how old-fashioned they are.

214
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,728
Rym: But Scott it took more effort to sell those tickets.

215
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:07,879
Rym: Anyway, the production of the tickets cost more.

216
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,566
Rym: your straw man is already burnt.

217
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:14,442
Scott: There is a. There's isn't much comic and anime news going down really I think.

218
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,677
Scott: but in a few months like July It's gonna.

219
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:17,430
Scott: are you kidding there?

220
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:23,490
Rym: Well, there's anime convention news Like what like the fact that anime Boston is gonna be at the same time as PAX East next year.

221
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:25,295
Scott: Well, that's not that big a news.

222
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:26,579
Scott: No, it's not news.

223
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,669
Rym: Even it's big news to half the people involved.

224
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:33,997
Scott: Yeah, what do we do about it?

225
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:34,659
Scott: just now?

226
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,647
Scott: I guess we're not gonna get a Boston which is sad.

227
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:37,490
Rym: that's not my news.

228
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:39,825
Rym: I was just saying that there's more news than you're letting on.

229
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:42,380
Rym: Yeah You started being argumentative.

230
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,264
Rym: I gotta finish the deal.

231
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:47,880
Rym: I got I can argue Bunch of anime in theaters trygun movie.

232
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:48,704
Rym: what happened to that?

233
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,010
Rym: There's a bunch of stuff we could talk about.

234
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,479
Scott: All right, like what was here was your anime news?

235
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:54,667
Rym: I'm gonna talk about a Star Trek convention.

236
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,731
Rym: So you go first All right.

237
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:59,085
Scott: Well, I don't have any news because I don't think there is any Star Trek convention.

238
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,110
Scott: Definitely isn't news.

239
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:02,535
Scott: So I got a geek bite right?

240
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:12,650
Scott: I read all three volumes of that people to thing that people talked about And you know you look at the cover and it's all booby and stuff and you're like, what's this gonna be?

241
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:22,030
Scott: Booby yeah, so I actually read the whole thing and I was you know I bought volume one just because I was like, you know, it was like a test of the waters, right?

242
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,970
Scott: It's like I can't you know.

243
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,130
Scott: I got to figure out what the deal is with this thing that is so much talk and so much sort of infamy.

244
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:28,989
Scott: So I got volume one and I was like, huh?

245
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,530
Scott: So then I got more two more volumes cuz only three volumes.

246
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,836
Scott: So why the hell not get the other two?

247
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:37,030
Scott: so I got the other two and I read the whole thing and it was actually.

248
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,697
Scott: It's weird cuz like.

249
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:40,248
Scott: it's not what you think it is.

250
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:41,112
Scott: It's like.

251
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,222
Scott: I expected it to be one thing and it was another thing.

252
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:46,730
Scott: It's like a total disguise maneuver.

253
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,833
Rym: You know, what's interesting?

254
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:52,948
Rym: a lot of the a anime I can name or the b-plus anime even pull that shit.

255
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:56,861
Rym: I mean try gun Captain Tyler hold some of that.

256
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:01,778
Scott: I mean a lot of it is you know The otaku think Japan is like this.

257
00:14:01,818 --> 00:14:02,500
Scott: Well, they're stupid.

258
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,430
Scott: Japan is normal people and Japanese people think America is like this.

259
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,515
Scott: Well, they're also stupid.

260
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:10,070
Scott: right and that was like one of the core messages of the thing.

261
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,829
Scott: But if you look at it, it's like, you know, it looks like it's gonna be a big perverted, you know thing.

262
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:17,450
Scott: But really it's not that perverted at all.

263
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:26,590
Scott: It didn't mean it has perverted parts But yeah, and it also, you know the way it goes it goes in a very not expected direction at many many points.

264
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:30,865
Scott: So it was totally worth reading and I don't want to give too much of it away.

265
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:33,557
Rym: But yeah Scott There's plenty of anime news.

266
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:41,588
Rym: It turns out that on Friday last week There was a really awesome cosplay of Umineko no naku karoni.

267
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:49,530
Rym: sure Great news and the Oxford English Dictionary added the word hentai to the dictionary.

268
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:56,568
Rym: All right, it means a sub-genre of the Japanese genres of manga and anime.

269
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:58,652
Rym: Uh-huh Plenty of news.

270
00:14:58,733 --> 00:14:59,094
Rym: Sure.

271
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:00,057
Scott: Great.

272
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,026
Scott: Why don't you discuss this news in depth?

273
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:03,608
Rym: I just did.

274
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:12,289
Rym: Okay Alright, so a lot of people, you know anime cons have their pros and cons and there's the drama in some of them and not and whatever.

275
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:26,444
Rym: and For anyone who thinks that anime cons are this height of drama I just want to remind all of you kids that there are science fiction conventions and Star Trek conventions And those are the biggest drama there ever is but they're a different kind of drama.

276
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:27,226
Rym: They're like the.

277
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:30,677
Rym: this drama That is it's it's the.

278
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:37,493
Rym: I think anime cons are gonna go this road but in a long long time Like remember when we were at RIT There was like an amazement.

279
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:42,568
Rym: and all these like science fiction and such conventions in the area that get like 500 people.

280
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,749
Rym: They were in a hotel for a weekend.

281
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:54,987
Rym: Well many many of them their their sci-fi conventions all over the country and they all tend to Be run today by the same people who are running them 20 even 30 years ago.

282
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:59,145
Rym: Yep Imagine if 30 years from now the same people are running Pat.

283
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:00,150
Rym: Oh wait, that'd still be awesome.

284
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:08,847
Rym: Imagine if 30 years from now the same people running Otakon today We're still running Otakon and they'd had no new people join the staff for that entire time.

285
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,181
Rym: Yep that'd be a disaster.

286
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:17,669
Rym: and This is kind of an interesting thing that I don't think people think about when they think about the drama conventions.

287
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:20,029
Scott: Well, cuz the most of these other conventions, right?

288
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:28,690
Scott: The only only the conventions that we go to like, you know The taxes and the mag fests and some of the anime cons are actually social party events.

289
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:33,549
Scott: the vast majority of these conventions are Basically a room full of tables.

290
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:38,779
Rym: Scott you ever been to a sci-fi con Once or twice?

291
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,810
Rym: name them name one.

292
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:45,550
Scott: They were like, you know tiny hole in the wall where the crap and like you never went to an amazement with me.

293
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,756
Scott: I never went to an amazement.

294
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:47,881
Rym: No or the I can't.

295
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:48,565
Rym: not an amazement.

296
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:52,406
Rym: I know I keep saying an amazement God, I don't even remember the name of it.

297
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:55,516
Scott: Connecticut is Astronomicon not everyone's that either.

298
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:59,997
Scott: That's the one I'm gonna con technically is part sci-fi convention Yeah, but it's also part everything else.

299
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:02,974
Rym: It is also yes replace every mention of an amazement I don't know.

300
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:03,683
Rym: I kept saying that.

301
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:10,289
Rym: but anyway actually sci-fi cons are Party cons, they're primarily social.

302
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:11,696
Rym: They're not like.

303
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:17,069
Rym: you see you're thinking of comic cons Which are mostly or trading conventions like trading cards or baseball cards.

304
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,135
Rym: Where is just a bunch of tables.

305
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:24,000
Rym: a lot of the sci-fi cons are a bunch of nerds getting together semi in costume and Going to room parties and drinking.

306
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,854
Rym: It's just not as screechy But that's it.

307
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:32,956
Scott: But every convention even the comic cons right that are even the worst comic cons have room parties and drinking Yeah, and costumes right?

308
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:36,550
Scott: The fact is that the there's no socialization at the convention.

309
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,543
Rym: Yeah, there is like people hang out because they're a hotel convention.

310
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,290
Scott: So they're no but it's not an official.

311
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:48,698
Scott: there's no events at the convention itself does not have like, you know a rave or You know a game room or and none of the.

312
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,670
Scott: the programming of the convention is the social aspect.

313
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,123
Scott: Obviously no matter what convention you have a science, you know conference or whatever.

314
00:17:56,343 --> 00:18:00,653
Scott: There's always drinking in the hotel in the lobby Conventions.

315
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:04,610
Rym: that just the fact that a bunch of like-minded people are in the same area is the primary.

316
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:09,070
Rym: But I'm saying the few rare conventions that have convention itself.

317
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:13,590
Scott: The content provided by the convention does not include socialization.

318
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:19,046
Scott: It may include, you know, some autograph tables and some vendors and maybe some at the same time.

319
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:22,136
Rym: without the convention itself The socialization would not occur.

320
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:27,252
Rym: this socialization is a direct result of the drawing of these people saying it's not a part of the of the Convention.

321
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:27,735
Rym: why not?

322
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:31,050
Rym: What if it happens at the convention in the convention only to people who bought bad?

323
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:31,752
Scott: It's not.

324
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:34,806
Scott: it's not a sanctioned program of the convention.

325
00:18:34,826 --> 00:18:35,730
Scott: So it doesn't count.

326
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,153
Scott: Completely different thing.

327
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,659
Scott: All right.

328
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:41,064
Rym: I disagree with you.

329
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:44,315
Scott: But anyway, uh Well, you all disagree today.

330
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,286
Scott: Did you uh, what did you eat today poison?

331
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:48,490
Rym: I disagree with you often.

332
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,397
Rym: I just don't always vocalize my opinions.

333
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:50,698
Rym: Uh-huh.

334
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,188
Scott: Yeah, you're being all ornery today artery.

335
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:53,730
Rym: I don't think so.

336
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,337
Scott: I think so.

337
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:55,127
Rym: I don't think so.

338
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:58,216
Scott: What is a pony?

339
00:18:58,277 --> 00:18:59,422
Scott: he was good at arguing.

340
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:01,110
Scott: what is a cutie mark even look like picture.

341
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:09,664
Rym: main rims face, so The Riverside Star Trek fest is in trouble and is probably going to go bankrupt.

342
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:11,769
Scott: All right, and what state is this?

343
00:19:13,114 --> 00:19:14,203
Rym: You don't know anything about Star Trek.

344
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,030
Rym: Do you know?

345
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,016
Rym: James Tiberius Kirk was born.

346
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:18,938
Rym: do you know?

347
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,540
Scott: I do.

348
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:22,149
Scott: I do know that captain Kirk is the Star Trek captain.

349
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,549
Rym: So that much this convention has been going on for a long time.

350
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:27,714
Rym: How long really.

351
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:28,176
Rym: the only.

352
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:29,120
Scott: it can't be that long.

353
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,706
Scott: Star Trek's only a few decades old.

354
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:31,589
Rym: That's a long time.

355
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,046
Scott: It hasn't been going since the 50s.

356
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:53,877
Rym: No, it hasn't Okay anyway, so the only reason this convention has been going anyway, because it doesn't make money is because the city Gives it a whole bunch of money from this fund that it has to put on events that are useful to the community From the local hotel casino.

357
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:55,643
Scott: Oh hotel casino.

358
00:19:55,683 --> 00:19:56,064
Scott: I thought it.

359
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:56,887
Scott: what state is this?

360
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:57,790
Scott: The casinos are legal?

361
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:00,362
Rym: Well, maybe you should look up where James Tiberius Kirk was born.

362
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:09,610
Rym: I think you don't know and that's why you're not saying anyway, so Apparently now the conventions like look we need money from the city to run the convention again.

363
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,245
Rym: And the city was like, yeah, you don't make any money.

364
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:14,460
Rym: We've give you $90,000 over the last three years.

365
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:18,482
Rym: We're probably not gonna give you any more money.

366
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:26,670
Scott: This makes me wonder though Is there cities that would be willing to pay us to run conventions that we could make into profitable conventions?

367
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,169
Scott: Very likely and then you know.

368
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,290
Scott: so we should try to find.

369
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:35,290
Rym: Look at how many cities fall into the scam of building a convention center to increase the profitability.

370
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:47,182
Rym: You saw that chart that showed that as awesome as packs and everything is the BC EC and the Hines are not quite driving Revenues for the city as much as people pretended it wouldn't know.

371
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:49,270
Scott: some conventions moved across town, but it has.

372
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:57,089
Scott: Anyway, but yeah We should find one of those cities to help us run our convention and then we can give the money back to that city That we profit with just to make them happy.

373
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:59,057
Rym: But basically there's this crazy drama.

374
00:20:59,198 --> 00:21:05,477
Rym: and because Star Trek conventions tend to draw Older demographics who are not internet culture.

375
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:07,082
Rym: This is how I'm bringing it back to anime cons.

376
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:09,248
Rym: Yeah, there's no internet nerd outrage.

377
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:12,270
Rym: nobody Except the hardest of the hardest core.

378
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:19,070
Rym: Know anything about the Riverside Trek fest let alone the drama and the fact is probably gonna go away.

379
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:22,850
Scott: Can you imagine all the people who go to very Trekkies and Trekkers?

380
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:29,039
Rym: We're gonna be fighting with each other and God was like look We don't have enough money to do the con next year.

381
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:29,881
Rym: Well people pitch in.

382
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:32,550
Rym: they'd probably raise like hundreds of thousands of dollars.

383
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,477
Scott: Yeah, I'm gullible kids.

384
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:34,918
Rym: Yeah.

385
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:35,360
Scott: Yeah.

386
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:37,387
Rym: Hey if they got every attendee to give them a dollar.

387
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:40,941
Scott: Yeah Yeah, it still wouldn't be enough to run over can know.

388
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:43,310
Rym: but Otakon is not nearly as expensive as you think it is.

389
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,636
Rym: No, it's an order of magnitude less than tax.

390
00:21:45,816 --> 00:21:47,882
Scott: Yeah, but but but it's bigger.

391
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:50,749
Rym: but here's the interest the kind of where I'm getting at.

392
00:21:51,590 --> 00:22:02,090
Rym: Convention culture is a huge part of modern youth internet II culture because Kids now socialize more online than they do in person at least in terms of like their true identity.

393
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:08,348
Rym: Like the gamer nerd in every town knows the one other gamer nerd in every other town Even if there aren't that many gamer nerds near them.

394
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:16,085
Rym: So for kids younger than us who are internet II the internet like conventions are basically The focal point is for nerds.

395
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:16,830
Scott: We're not nerds.

396
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,215
Scott: It's not a big deal nerds and geeks.

397
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:23,033
Rym: but non nerds and geeks have enough local culture to where they don't need to seek it Elsewhere.

398
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:31,783
Rym: Yeah, I mean if you're into generic pop culture stuff There's plenty of people who are into the same stuff nearby you like three and a half men or two and a half men Or whatever that show is.

399
00:22:32,371 --> 00:22:34,747
Scott: Somebody nearby probably want to talk about TV.

400
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:45,450
Rym: in sports You don't need to go to a convention, but if you want to talk about James Tiberius Kirk's birthplace You got to go somewhere with other people and we don't have full-on virtual reality yet.

401
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,216
Scott: So what's the news about this convention?

402
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:47,958
Rym: That was the news.

403
00:22:47,998 --> 00:22:48,560
Rym: it's going out.

404
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,282
Rym: It's going down.

405
00:22:49,443 --> 00:22:50,245
Rym: There's no money.

406
00:22:50,747 --> 00:22:51,168
Scott: Okay.

407
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:53,358
Scott: Sure Yeah, great.

408
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:56,256
Rym: I'm just noting that Alright, never mind.

409
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:57,541
Rym: You don't care.

410
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,470
Rym: You don't care about Star Trek convention.

411
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,619
Scott: I don't really care about a Star Trek convention.

412
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:10,789
Rym: go the fact that the primary like convention culture I think is going to be one of the big moving forces of the upcoming generations of youth the yet born children.

413
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:30,809
Rym: and I think that the conventions that focus on having the dual aspects of user generated content coupled with Being a place for a whole bunch of nerds to get together who know each other online But don't know each other in person Cons of the twofold that are for-profit are going to make more money than big-box stores ever did

414
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:32,053
Scott: Probably and

415
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:33,719
Rym: that big-box stores could in fact.

416
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:37,030
Scott: but but big-box stores are open all day every day.

417
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:42,960
Scott: Conventions are gonna be once a year and for now, you can't have that many conventions You can't.

418
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:47,570
Scott: you can't like, you know You you know convention can run itself multiple times per year.

419
00:23:47,752 --> 00:23:56,659
Scott: And if there were conventions every weekend Like let's say you live next to a convention center and there was a convention a nerdy convention in almost every weekend Somewhere within shooting distance.

420
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:57,161
Scott: Yeah, right.

421
00:23:57,463 --> 00:24:03,449
Scott: You couldn't go to all of them You could no one can handle it and they would all be diluted heavily the fact that they are.

422
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:09,330
Scott: You know that there's sort of actually at this sweet spot right now where if there are any more of them Then it would dilute the rest of them.

423
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,737
Scott: But if there are any less we could still probably use some more.

424
00:24:11,978 --> 00:24:14,505
Rym: so you've headed toward my grand conclusion.

425
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:26,145
Rym: if you couple this with demographic movements showing that by and large young people are moving to the cities like in droves like young people are just they go to conventions because they don't have people right nearby them.

426
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:30,049
Rym: they're into their stuff and They're also all moving into cities.

427
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:37,550
Rym: So I think there's a rumbling rise in all the urban centers of nerdy stuff that happens at a low level all the time.

428
00:24:38,011 --> 00:25:08,715
Rym: so I think the far out of that is that the large gigantic conventions of today are either they're all gonna disappear within the next 40 or 50 years or The big conventions that are established that don't fuck themselves over with internal drama and bullshit will be the only Conventions and we'll have like the Pax's the Otakons the whatever survives and Everything else is just going to be like our nerd nights where there's just constant nerdery everywhere Cities.

429
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:12,395
Scott: I think that the conventions scene will pretty much You know stay.

430
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:18,967
Scott: the same conventions will come and go but the numbers Sizes and geographic locations of them will just sort of correct to the market.

431
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:21,670
Scott: and you know They I don't think it's gonna be it will correct to the market.

432
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,785
Rym: I'm saying the markets gonna change rapidly in the next 30 40 years.

433
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:28,763
Scott: Well, I mean, yeah, okay everything everything in the whole universe will change in 30 40 years.

434
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:38,800
Scott: It's like, you know, come on anyway things of the day.

435
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,977
Rym: my guess was 34 and I was Way off.

436
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:43,410
Rym: you can guess if it was high or low.

437
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:52,925
Rym: But uh, this is just a mash-up of every bone that Steven Seagal Acting as Steven Seagal in a movie has broken in another character.

438
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,450
Scott: Well, they weren't really bones broken.

439
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,234
Scott: They were in movie.

440
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:57,124
Scott: bones broke because it was a movie right.

441
00:25:57,144 --> 00:25:58,290
Scott: the thing you weren't real bone.

442
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:10,070
Scott: No the thing about this though that I wonder right is you watch a lot of these scenes and it's like he'll twist a guy's Arm and they'll make a cracking sound effect, but it's like Did he break the ulna and the radius should have counted that twice?

443
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,680
Rym: Maybe you should watch the video because they address that do they?

444
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:21,370
Rym: they address that very very specifically, uh-huh I also know there's one scene where he does something and a guy falls down, but there's no cracking noise.

445
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,101
Rym: I was about to say that's bullshit.

446
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:30,176
Rym: and then the guy on the ground yells and I quote But you don't just cuz he.

447
00:26:30,317 --> 00:26:31,662
Scott: maybe his leg just really hurts.

448
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,370
Rym: I think he broke his leg.

449
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:34,113
Scott: I don't know.

450
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,945
Scott: Like I've seen people like stub their toes like I broke my toe.

451
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:38,150
Scott: I was like you stub your toe.

452
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,732
Scott: You're a wuss.

453
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:41,664
Rym: Ah, it was pretty much broken in this case.

454
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:42,889
Scott: How could you tell it was a movie?

455
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,414
Scott: It definitely wasn't broken.

456
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:46,424
Rym: Ah it in the movie universe.

457
00:26:46,484 --> 00:26:47,669
Rym: It definitely was broken.

458
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,778
Rym: Maybe to quote.

459
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,790
Scott: keep in mind you're getting your Gandalf girth in these broken bones.

460
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,402
Rym: There are multiple bones in the forearm lower leg neck and hand.

461
00:26:57,863 --> 00:27:01,394
Rym: each break in those areas will only be counted once Uh-huh.

462
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:02,018
Rym: Okay.

463
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:02,602
Scott: Well, what if?

464
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:03,830
Scott: what if internet nitpickers?

465
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,552
Scott: What about this?

466
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:05,717
Scott: only I watched a video.

467
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,810
Scott: most of it is like him twisting and hitting and you know kicking, right?

468
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,616
Scott: What about when he shoots somebody?

469
00:27:10,656 --> 00:27:14,070
Scott: now if you shoot someone in the head, is that not breaking the skull bone?

470
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,172
Rym: You could argue that.

471
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:19,410
Scott: but what about if I shoot someone wearing body armor Scott with a powerful enough weapon?

472
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,373
Scott: He would break their ribs.

473
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:20,875
Rym: why in the?

474
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:25,971
Rym: how many rims got broken Scott why in the ever-living fuck would Steven Seagal ever shoot Someone?

475
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,758
Rym: his fist is clearly more power.

476
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:28,500
Rym: He shoots people.

477
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,508
Scott: I've seen it in movies.

478
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,190
Scott: He doesn't really shoot.

479
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,424
Rym: This is only when he breaks bones with manual action.

480
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:35,609
Rym: No propellants.

481
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:49,382
Rym: Yeah, the real person seems like I was a peaceful man, but now it moves multiple bones on the same person Disparately like there's one guy where he breaks one knee then the other knee Elbow then the other elbow and a couple of ribs.

482
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:50,687
Rym: all those counted.

483
00:27:50,888 --> 00:27:53,217
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so it's March.

484
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:56,009
Scott: Well, it's almost April and it's still fucking cold.

485
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:56,210
Scott: fuck.

486
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,756
Rym: Anyway, it was nice today.

487
00:27:58,137 --> 00:28:02,836
Scott: March in the United States for people who don't know means March Madness Which nerds also don't know.

488
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:05,970
Scott: it's basically when the the the college basketball has a tournament.

489
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:13,483
Scott: No, I'm a sports fan, but not so much a basketball fan Huge fan of the last 40 seconds of any basketball match.

490
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:16,292
Scott: Yeah basketball is not my favorite sport I don't know.

491
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:17,496
Scott: I think it has many problems.

492
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:18,681
Scott: It shares many with soccer.

493
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:31,794
Rym: But anyway basketball better or worse than soccer Equal all right basketball better or worse than curling Equal.

494
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:35,190
Scott: I think curling is probably a better sport, but it's not fun to watch.

495
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:38,881
Scott: Fun to watch Basketball is a little more fun is more fun to watch.

496
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:49,805
Scott: if you know what's going on, maybe I mean while the sport of basketball may suck the NCAA basketball tournament is actually a thing of beauty because it is.

497
00:28:49,946 --> 00:29:00,161
Scott: it is a single elimination Tournament with many many entrants now and it is quite often awesome How severe underdogs make it very close to the end or even win.

498
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:04,674
Rym: the NCAA tournament and the Stanley Cup are my two Favorite sports tournaments.

499
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:05,036
Scott: Yes.

500
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:07,525
Scott: It is an excellent tournament for a bad sport.

501
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:18,206
Scott: Anyway, I somebody who comic mix calm Created a webcomics March Madness tournament, which webcomic is the best single elimination voting.

502
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:19,349
Scott: Oh, let's go.

503
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:19,950
Rym: That would be easy.

504
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,916
Rym: I was like penny arcade xkc.

505
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:26,872
Scott: penny arcade made it but it lost to kawaii Not.

506
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:28,657
Rym: what the hell is that?

507
00:29:28,677 --> 00:29:30,825
Scott: I don't know that was in the that.

508
00:29:30,865 --> 00:29:36,322
Scott: so that was in the Second, so if it would have been kawaii not went to the final four.

509
00:29:36,764 --> 00:29:42,842
Scott: So if penny arcade had won It would have gone to the final four the final four.

510
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:44,288
Scott: So when was this going on?

511
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:44,910
Scott: How are they doing?

512
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:46,382
Scott: They finished it just now.

513
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:49,376
Rym: clearly None of us knew about it.

514
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:50,380
Scott: No, it just finished.

515
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:52,910
Rym: This is why I could something I've never heard of could win, right?

516
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:59,104
Scott: So kawaii not was against Gronk Which is Katie Cook's comic and they were up against the other two.

517
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:02,697
Scott: in the final four were earth world versus questionable content.

518
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,327
Rym: really questionable content is not that funny.

519
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:07,713
Rym: Yeah, and Earth worlds.

520
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:08,074
Rym: Okay.

521
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:11,086
Scott: I think it was just near the demographics of the people.

522
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:11,970
Rym: That's what I'm saying.

523
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:14,510
Rym: I'm saying was a heavily skewed turn.

524
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,587
Scott: It was skewed to the demographics of the readers of comic mix.

525
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:24,918
Rym: calm Of course this that would be the same as if I was like, alright, let's have a video game character mashup Who's better Mario or Sonic?

526
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:27,568
Rym: and I'm only gonna tell people on the Sega forums to vote.

527
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:30,981
Scott: Yeah Well, this is you know this whatever but the point is okay.

528
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:31,924
Rym: Kawaii knots not funny.

529
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:32,345
Rym: I'm sorry.

530
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:33,670
Scott: You never have you read it?

531
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,655
Rym: I'm reading it right now.

532
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:35,380
Rym: It's okay.

533
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:36,848
Rym: It's you know, what?

534
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:38,874
Scott: How many have you read?

535
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:41,203
Scott: You only learned about the webcomic less than a minute ago.

536
00:30:41,223 --> 00:30:42,207
Scott: I read like 10.

537
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,413
Rym: Okay 11 They're cute.

538
00:30:44,454 --> 00:30:44,896
Rym: But you know what?

539
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:46,845
Rym: They are they're threadless shirt the comic.

540
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:51,140
Rym: Oh, all right I never actually I like it, but it's not better than penny arcade or xkcd.

541
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:52,505
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

542
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:53,688
Scott: is xkcd even on here?

543
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,780
Scott: Yes It is Xkcd made it and also lost to Kawaii knot.

544
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,786
Scott: very early on Scott read Kawaii knot.

545
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:02,270
Rym: it is threadless the comic.

546
00:31:02,754 --> 00:31:04,529
Rym: Every one of them is just a threadless shirt.

547
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:09,670
Scott: Anyway, the point is is that you should you know, go check out this little tournament.

548
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:12,963
Scott: It's it's kind of fun, even though we may disagree with the results.

549
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:14,127
Rym: Okay, this was pretty funny.

550
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:14,850
Rym: It's humble pie.

551
00:31:15,811 --> 00:31:18,740
Rym: Yeah, I'm not the most important mathematical constant.

552
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:24,837
Scott: and the final battle is earthworld versus Gronk And the current revoked I'm voting for Gronk.

553
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,582
Scott: earthworld is winning 61% to 39%.

554
00:31:26,582 --> 00:31:27,344
Scott: why is earthworld the winner?

555
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:33,415
Rym: I Call bullshit on that tournament.

556
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:36,043
Rym: Anyway, I call absolute bullshit earthworld.

557
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,608
Scott: Oh, actually this Kawaii knot is cute.

558
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:38,110
Rym: It is cute.

559
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:39,907
Rym: I like it, but it's not better than xkcd.

560
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:42,334
Scott: Uh, this birdcage.

561
00:31:42,354 --> 00:31:42,515
Scott: Yeah.

562
00:31:42,535 --> 00:31:42,716
Scott: Yeah.

563
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:45,705
Scott: Yeah, it's not better than xkcd, but I do like it.

564
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:48,456
Rym: Yeah ice cream Yeah, but you see what I mean?

565
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:50,166
Rym: It's like threadless made a comic.

00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,516

Rym: Oh that milk one is good.

569
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:57,613
Scott: Okay, uh Jawbreaker.

570
00:31:58,176 --> 00:31:58,377
Rym: Okay.

571
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,263
Rym: I'm more of a threat.

572
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:07,910
Rym: Yeah Alright after having just read a whole bunch of Kawaii knot and while I call bullshit on the tournament Kawaii knot is an okay comic.

573
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:09,255
Scott: Oh, man, the yachts.

574
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:10,198
Scott: Did you read the yahtzee one?

575
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:10,760
Scott: Yes, I did.

576
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:13,330
Rym: I'm going to start reading Kawaii knot.

577
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,242
Rym: Yeah, but it's not better than xkcd or penny arcade or dr.

578
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:17,724
Scott: McNinja.

579
00:32:17,844 --> 00:32:20,793
Scott: Yeah, but it's I don't even think dr McNinja was on here.

580
00:32:20,914 --> 00:32:24,103
Scott: Oh, no, it lost to xkop early on.

581
00:32:24,123 --> 00:32:27,892
Scott: Okay, that's not lost to earth world What?

582
00:32:28,232 --> 00:32:31,481
Scott: Yeah, what earth world beat wonder mark - what.

583
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:33,827
Scott: and Johnny Wonder wasn't even on here.

584
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:44,159
Rym: Ah so anyway The meta moment if you saw us at a convention and you wanted to see these slides From a panel we did at that convention.

585
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:46,770
Rym: Look at the news on GeekNights the archive.

586
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,420
Rym: Yes on our website and the slides are up.

587
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:54,130
Rym: we also have video of one of our panels the triple threat from PAC.

588
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:59,038
Rym: so if you like any of our stuff and you didn't see that panel, you'll probably really like the panel.

589
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:09,030
Rym: and through the power of One HD camera and me zooming in and out on that one camera We've got an okay video probably the best video we've made ever.

590
00:33:09,311 --> 00:33:09,411
Scott: The

591
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:23,250
Rym: secret is that I zoomed in on me every time Scott was the hypno toting and I zoomed in on Scott every time I was like poking at my face or picking my nose And between the two I could zoom in on one of us and if we were both picking our noses I cut to the slide.

592
00:33:23,993 --> 00:33:25,893
Rym: nice The book club book.

593
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:28,222
Rym: when Scott finishes it is Michio Kaku's hyperspace.

594
00:33:28,564 --> 00:33:32,055
Scott: The next book club book is We're gonna find out.

595
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:33,121
Rym: you don't want to announce it yet.

596
00:33:33,603 --> 00:33:34,709
Scott: Wait till we're done with this book.

Rym: I will be out of town, but Scott will be there.

610
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:07,389
Scott: I'll be there.

611
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:09,681
Rym: I think Scott should bring a game of Monopoly to play.

612
00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:11,614
Scott: I will not be no fooling I'm just gonna.

613
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:23,059
Rym: it's gonna be real board game night And we will be at anime Boston in April doing a whole bunch of panels and hanging out and doing stuff And then we'll have a nice break until ConnectiCon and such.

614
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,610
Rym: Yep ConnectiCon the other packs maybe Otakon We I mean, I'm actually really looking forward to anime boss.

615
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:36,212
Rym: I'm really looking forward to any Boston to one get to hang out with Mike tool and Gerald and Daryl and all my anime con Friends.

616
00:34:36,452 --> 00:34:45,460
Rym: if they go to I get to eat the real goddamn food of Boston on Newbury Street instead of the Non-existent food by the BC going to the secret breakfast every time.

617
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:46,844
Rym: Oh my god the secret breakfast.

618
00:34:47,608 --> 00:34:49,748
Rym: Oh my god I want that food right now.

619
00:34:50,212 --> 00:34:53,248
Rym: Hunger, those are the best French toasts I've ever had.

620
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,942
Scott: I don't know if ever but that was the one of the best French.

621
00:34:55,962 --> 00:35:01,650
Rym: You know what I'm gonna say long Definitely in the top three because I don't want to commit absolutely top three.

622
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,144
Rym: I gotta think back to make sure there were pancakes I had.

623
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:05,070
Scott: that were definitely better.

624
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,434
Rym: And you know what?

625
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:09,100
Rym: I kind of want to go to Otakon.

626
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:11,450
Rym: actually, I'm feeling anime cons again after Zenkai County.

627
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,458
Scott: Yeah, you know, it's up to Otakon.

628
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:15,325
Rym: Yeah, it's a hundred percent up to Otakon.

629
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:16,449
Rym: We submitted all our panels.

630
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:21,750
Scott: So Out I'm not gonna pay for a badge and I really don't want to wait in line.

631
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:24,070
Rym: But but I believe I'll even wait in the line.

632
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:29,470
Rym: I'm just saying if we don't appear at Otakon it has nothing to do with us not wishing to appear at Otakon.

633
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,868
Scott: Yeah, and I would I would go.

634
00:35:31,752 --> 00:35:32,838
Rym: But I think what it is is at.

635
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:34,690
Scott: you know, every year wasn't too much of a pain in the ass.

636
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,408
Rym: I forget what conventions are like through the cold and horrid winter.

637
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:41,850
Rym: and Then we go to Zenkai Con and suddenly I remember that you know what?

638
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:43,908
Rym: I'm not here for me.

639
00:35:44,712 --> 00:35:52,012
Rym: I'm here for all those kids who came to the beyond Naruto panel and walked out of that room thinking hokuto zankai ken That's right.

640
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:53,496
Rym: That's why we do this.

641
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:54,600
Scott: We do it.

642
00:35:55,442 --> 00:35:55,803
Rym: So Scott.

643
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:58,210
Rym: Do you read any of the comics that you read digitally?

644
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:00,450
Rym: Yeah, which one's penny arcade?

645
00:36:01,031 --> 00:36:01,133
Scott: dr.

646
00:36:01,154 --> 00:36:04,417
Scott: McNinja Oh, you know all those.

647
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,790
Rym: so I guess digital comic distribution works just fine on the internet.

648
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:08,472
Scott: It sure does.

649
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,745
Rym: I mean granted people pirate penny arcade occasionally.

650
00:36:11,785 --> 00:36:13,130
Scott: How did you pirate penny arcade?

651
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,925
Rym: I mean, I've read it through unauthorized distribution channels in the past.

652
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,230
Scott: I'm sure they're so worried.

653
00:36:20,794 --> 00:36:21,606
Scott: They're coming after you.

654
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:25,730
Rym: Obviously, we're not gonna talk about web comics other than the fact that I don't know.

655
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,240
Scott: How could you not talk about web comics?

656
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:28,830
Rym: Well, what does web comics do?

657
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:35,719
Rym: I think people who do web comics do it primarily for the love of it and would do it Even if it wasn't profitable.

658
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:39,741
Rym: so as a result some of them Yeah, some of them most of them I think most of the good ones.

659
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:46,443
Rym: So as a result they do it and They don't worry so much about making money off of it.

660
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,970
Rym: And if they do make money, that's great.

661
00:36:48,312 --> 00:36:49,358
Scott: I actually think it's.

662
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,142
Scott: it's weird though.

663
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:51,550
Scott: There are a significant number.

664
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:57,450
Scott: It's obviously not a majority by any stretch right but there are a significant number of the really good web comics.

665
00:36:57,871 --> 00:37:04,209
Scott: right are either are done by people who do it for a living because their comic became popular and then they made money.

666
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:13,524
Scott: they make their living from merch and such or People who are really good artists who make money by doing art you know in other ways and they happen to also do a web comic.

667
00:37:13,544 --> 00:37:16,936
Scott: that may make supplemental or A significant portion.

668
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:20,210
Rym: knowing that case it's much like not to name names.

669
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,881
Scott: But for example, we just talked about this tournament right.

670
00:37:22,901 --> 00:37:24,970
Scott: the runner-up was Gronk by Katie Cook.

671
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:27,109
Scott: Katie Cook makes her money doing arts.

672
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:32,225
Scott: I don't think Gronk specifically makes her that much money, but you know, she still.

673
00:37:32,365 --> 00:37:34,050
Scott: she makes her money as an artist.

674
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,250
Scott: You know drawing like trading cards and all sorts of stuff.

675
00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:47,710
Rym: So yep, but I guess is that you can if you are an artist doing something You can have a community around yourself and use the webcomic that you do as a focal point for that community.

676
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:54,030
Rym: It kind of keeps everyone who discovered you at some point and is a fan of your work in a holding pattern around you.

677
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:57,570
Rym: So whenever you do something new you have this guaranteed audience ready to go.

678
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,258
Scott: Well take for example our friend the author of dr.

679
00:38:00,298 --> 00:38:01,261
Scott: McNinja, right?

680
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:04,270
Scott: He is now writing Deadpool, which is totally the right move.

681
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:05,214
Rym: Yeah, right.

682
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,882
Scott: So it's like hey, look at that.

683
00:38:07,264 --> 00:38:08,590
Rym: or look at Brian Clevenger.

684
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:13,425
Scott: He learned the business making a bit they made a bit theater and now he's doing a Tom Grover.

685
00:38:13,506 --> 00:38:14,830
Rym: Yeah, which is fucking awesome.

686
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:15,706
Scott: You can't go wrong.

687
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:18,294
Scott: But yeah, I want to.

688
00:38:18,354 --> 00:38:19,097
Scott: I want to talk about.

689
00:38:19,157 --> 00:38:23,130
Scott: you know digital comics themselves are sort of getting a resurgence now.

690
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:30,606
Scott: I mean You know we could talk about the same stuff We always talk about with the piracy and the DRM and the copyright and the companies.

691
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:31,930
Scott: companies don't want to up.

692
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:33,297
Scott: You know go digital.

693
00:38:33,317 --> 00:38:34,101
Scott: They're so hesitant.

694
00:38:34,182 --> 00:38:35,750
Scott: even it's like you think it's a new thing.

695
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,881
Scott: But really digital has been around for like over a decade.

696
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:41,590
Scott: It's already like they're already too late yada yada yada.

697
00:38:41,811 --> 00:38:51,690
Rym: well, what I would propose that we do is Remember the last 15 years of arguing about software piracy and then music piracy and then movie piracy.

698
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:57,370
Rym: Just pretend we'd said all of those things about digital comics, right?

699
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:05,410
Scott: The only other the only thing to add to that argument right about digital comics Is that we already sort of talked about it a minute ago?

700
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:11,569
Scott: Is that you know while people sort of have questionable business models for the other mediums?

701
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,716
Scott: There is a business model for digital comics.

702
00:39:13,757 --> 00:39:14,479
Scott: It's web comics.

703
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:15,061
Scott: It exists.

704
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:27,990
Rym: Yep, right and if you don't do it then But of course you do have to look at how web comics that do make money make money and it's always either like you We said they make money from alternate revenue streams that aren't even directly related to the car.

705
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,923
Scott: It's it's the same way a musician can make money from concerts as opposed to selling albums.

706
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:34,210
Rym: Yeah or merch or conventions?

707
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:35,450
Scott: Yep, exactly.

708
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:47,274
Scott: Anyway, but digital comics, you know as a thing has been getting more attention than the other, you know did problems meet artistic mediums are having in the digital space recently because of Tablet computing.

709
00:39:47,696 --> 00:39:51,530
Scott: right tablet computers have been around for a long time, but only recently have tablet devices.

710
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,226
Scott: I don't even know if I want to come, you know, I guess it's technically a computer.

711
00:39:54,266 --> 00:40:03,842
Rym: but you know, yeah I'm starting to think however that our clients I think large tablets are not going to be Super popular within I think within five years.

712
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,550
Rym: It's gonna be a fad that dies out a little bit.

713
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:06,209
Scott: Well, we'll see.

714
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:15,590
Scott: but anyway because of the tablets iPad specifically digital comics are having a resurgence of sorts in in Attention and popularity and development.

715
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:26,530
Scott: so I you know there are a significant number of things to talk about in the digital comics realm that do not apply to the You know the general, you know digital art discussions that you have all the time.

716
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:30,730
Rym: Well, there is the tactile issue of their days and books have the same thing.

717
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,606
Rym: We could basically have this exact discussion about books or comics.

718
00:40:34,169 --> 00:40:35,980
Scott: now It's all different for comics though.

719
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:46,401
Scott: comics for first of all they need color right and even if it's a black and white comic even if they're So few comics are straight black and white this grayscale and even it.

720
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:50,233
Scott: and even if it's grayscale you need higher resolution Right.

721
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:54,210
Scott: I mean I've seen some manga that looks pretty good in a Kindle or a Nook or whatever.

722
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:58,710
Scott: But really you need you know, it's been so much better on an iPad.

723
00:40:59,193 --> 00:41:02,290
Scott: You know, it looks it, you know, you can't be reading it on I would not.

724
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:05,821
Scott: Reading a manga on a Kindle would not be acceptable for me.

725
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,107
Scott: I don't think it just wouldn't be.

726
00:41:07,227 --> 00:41:07,890
Scott: it wouldn't be good enough.

727
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:08,956
Rym: Well, it depends.

728
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:11,310
Rym: we're not quite there with the screen technology on the Kindle yet.

729
00:41:11,551 --> 00:41:12,536
Scott: I mean, it's like, you know, it's.

730
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:15,409
Scott: it's sort of this same argument as like the bit rates of mp3s.

731
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:17,113
Scott: But it's like.

732
00:41:17,534 --> 00:41:19,119
Rym: but Scott technology solved that.

733
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:19,460
Rym: I mean.

734
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,850
Rym: eventually we got to the point to where I can encode all my music in.

735
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:26,321
Rym: You know 356 whatever like maximum mp3.

736
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:30,877
Scott: Yeah, but it's like there is a bit space while you know I'll listen to 128 bit mp3.

737
00:41:30,897 --> 00:41:31,580
Scott: That's just fine.

738
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,310
Scott: But there is a point at which it's like the bit rate is so low.

739
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,270
Scott: It's like unlistenable.

740
00:41:35,752 --> 00:41:36,193
Scott: Well, it's got.

741
00:41:36,273 --> 00:41:41,450
Rym: even I was listening to my old mp3s like from the early days when 128 was really the standard.

742
00:41:41,651 --> 00:41:45,167
Rym: Yeah, they actually sound pretty god-awful compared to modern mp3s.

743
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,277
Scott: Yeah, I don't have much of a problem.

744
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,889
Rym: part of it's because remember the encoding was done differently too.

745
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:52,210
Scott: Now that is true coding has gotten better.

746
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:57,750
Rym: Yeah, 128 made with modern codecs probably sounds way better than a 128 made with the original front offer.

747
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:58,409
Scott: That's true, too.

748
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,976
Scott: But I'm just making an analogy there.

749
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:04,254
Scott: right there, you know comics on some devices right digitally It's just.

750
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:07,250
Scott: they're just not acceptable quality to where you can't even read them.

751
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,726
Scott: Right, especially a lot of scans lations are scanned at low-res Scott.

752
00:42:10,746 --> 00:42:11,510
Rym: That's a current thing.

753
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,700
Rym: I mean that'll trivially be fixed by technology.

754
00:42:14,062 --> 00:42:15,930
Rym: Yeah, kinda kind of like how look at movies.

755
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,359
Rym: I mean the two sides of the coin in movies.

756
00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:22,574
Rym: at first it was the problem that there's no way to watch Movies on the go.

757
00:42:22,614 --> 00:42:23,617
Rym: TVs are gigantic.

758
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,530
Rym: Yep, and then we got LCDs and I my game gear.

759
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:30,220
Rym: I could have bought the TV adapter and watch TV.

760
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:31,546
Scott: It had that at summer camp.

761
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:32,670
Scott: He couldn't tune shit.

762
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,129
Scott: We were in a valley in the middle of the woods.

763
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:41,030
Rym: No, no, but like the technology got better and better and now there are people who just watch movies on their iPhones.

764
00:42:41,534 --> 00:42:43,388
Rym: Yep, and they don't complain at all.

765
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,743
Rym: But by the same token talk to some purists and you'll see arguments.

766
00:42:47,763 --> 00:42:51,295
Rym: to the point of if you think this is a quote You can look up online who said it.

767
00:42:52,419 --> 00:42:56,554
Rym: if you think you've seen a movie because you watched it on a phone You haven't seen the movie.

768
00:42:56,855 --> 00:42:57,497
Scott: That's bullshit.

769
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:57,879
Rym: Yeah.

770
00:42:57,899 --> 00:43:01,050
Scott: Well, it is a different experience Eva on the phone on the train.

771
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:05,934
Rym: Yeah, but you could argue that it is a different experience But it's slightly time.

772
00:43:05,974 --> 00:43:09,065
Rym: The technology has made it such that people don't care.

773
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:09,988
Rym: It's good enough for them.

774
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:15,131
Scott: Yep But yeah, but there there are you know, a lot of digital comics, you know, they might you know There's.

775
00:43:15,252 --> 00:43:18,690
Scott: there is a level good enough for them, but there's a lot that are good enough for nobody.

776
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:23,110
Rym: Well for now, but imagine I mean someday we're gonna have possibly paper.

777
00:43:23,431 --> 00:43:26,001
Rym: That's just like a paper like a comic and it's just digital.

778
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,346
Rym: every page shows whatever you want.

779
00:43:27,366 --> 00:43:28,170
Rym: You just read through it.

780
00:43:28,451 --> 00:43:29,256
Scott: Yeah, that'll be awesome.

781
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:31,428
Rym: Yeah, we'll have that someday and then it'll be a moot point.

782
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:36,250
Scott: Yep Anyway, the other problem with digital comics right is the interface of them, right?

783
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,860
Scott: So when you get comics in print, right?

784
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,130
Scott: They're the right size for reading, you know.

785
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,109
Scott: They're the size they were meant to be, you know.

786
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:46,655
Scott: But if you get them digitally You're only have.

787
00:43:46,716 --> 00:43:49,830
Scott: your screen is only one size but comics come in all shapes guys.

788
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:56,590
Rym: Clearly I should make a Kindle device just for comics that is as big as the library collections of like Hellboy.

789
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:58,056
Scott: Okay, and then what?

790
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:01,270
Scott: if you want to read a death note on it it's way too big letterboxed.

791
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,202
Scott: So you got this giant thing to read a tiny tiny guy?

792
00:44:04,222 --> 00:44:05,288
Scott: Yeah, that's great.

793
00:44:05,368 --> 00:44:09,043
Rym: Yeah Yeah, you realize the real answer in the far future.

794
00:44:09,123 --> 00:44:10,990
Rym: We'll just see it in our brain and won't matter.

795
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:13,541
Scott: Yes, but we're talking about right now, right?

796
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:15,529
Rym: I'm just saying technology will solve that problem, too.

797
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,662
Scott: Yes, technology will solve every problem.

798
00:44:17,683 --> 00:44:18,810
Scott: You don't need to state it of everything.

799
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:24,972
Scott: The point is that right now there's a significant problem with digital comics and that the user interface is Incredibly far.

800
00:44:25,153 --> 00:44:34,223
Rym: Well, actually I have a question then what could like design the device right now That you would just start reading the majority of your comics on if it existed?

801
00:44:34,846 --> 00:44:36,371
Scott: if it existed like a minimum Like.

802
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:40,344
Rym: obviously you could say the mind thing, but what's like the the minimum?

803
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:41,569
Rym: like what is the first remember?

804
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:41,930
Rym: way back?

805
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,097
Rym: We did a show on, you know smartphones.

806
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:45,723
Rym: What is the minimum smartphone?

807
00:44:45,743 --> 00:44:47,369
Rym: We would buy what is the you know?

808
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:49,154
Rym: Maximum smartphone we would buy.

809
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:54,570
Scott: I mean, I think you know, I would probably have no problem reading comics on an iPad to like device.

810
00:44:55,851 --> 00:45:05,970
Scott: You know cuz even if I had to zoom some in or resize some, you know, it sucks, but it's not the worst It's that you know, but the main thing that stops me from doing that is no mostly the pricing and the business models.

811
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:14,623
Scott: You know It's like they charge so much money to get the comics digitally legally That and it's such a pain in the ass to get them illegally.

812
00:45:14,684 --> 00:45:15,427
Scott: It's just not worth it.

813
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:19,986
Scott: It's easier Just order them all at his extreme discount in the old-fashioned way.

814
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:20,810
Rym: now, here's my trouble.

815
00:45:21,572 --> 00:45:26,388
Rym: I would buy digital comics and even a reader for them just because of the convenience.

816
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:29,301
Rym: but Not only is there DRM?

817
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:30,970
Scott: Oh, yeah, of course the DRM, right?

818
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,980
Rym: But the quality is also worse like you noted and it's expensive.

819
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:35,442
Rym: now.

820
00:45:35,582 --> 00:45:39,356
Rym: if they were dirt cheap with DRM and bad quality I might consider it for things.

821
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:40,282
Rym: I don't care about that much.

822
00:45:40,664 --> 00:45:43,762
Rym: if they were expensive But there was no DRM and they were high quality.

823
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,270
Scott: I would probably pay for it.

824
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:50,510
Scott: The other thing is not just you know, even with the DRM is availability, right?

825
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:54,106
Scott: And you know, we're not reading superhero comics that much so it's not like we need.

826
00:45:54,126 --> 00:46:00,430
Scott: you know I care that much if I get the spider-man comic on my iPad the day that the spider-man comic comes out.

827
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:02,190
Scott: Right because they actually don't do that.

828
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,359
Scott: The point is is like there's no.

829
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:10,629
Scott: Gary the comics that I want to read like fables I don't think is legally available to read on any digital place.

830
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:17,330
Scott: Is that there's two different demographic and there's no guarantee that it's always gonna continue to come out in that format.

831
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:25,653
Rym: it's got the Read and the comics that I read by and large are the ones that people who care about comics read not just superhero comics But comics in general.

832
00:46:26,014 --> 00:46:30,529
Rym: people have a wide voracious appetite for comics and graphic novels manga things like that.

833
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:41,010
Rym: Those are the people for whom the quality doesn't matter and for whom they probably have Some sentimental or personal reasons for wanting to own the physical volumes for the art for display.

834
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:44,078
Rym: There's all this other stuff to where they would.

835
00:46:44,238 --> 00:46:48,710
Rym: not enough of them would settle for the inferior digital versions to make it worthwhile to pursue.

836
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:54,232
Rym: Meanwhile on the opposite side of the coin the people who just care what happened to spider-man They will.

837
00:46:54,252 --> 00:46:55,517
Rym: they'll just pirate it if they can.

838
00:46:55,537 --> 00:46:59,490
Rym: so the that side of the coin is desperately afraid of having any digital version available.

839
00:46:59,572 --> 00:47:00,026
Rym: There's an FDR.

840
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:09,356
Scott: Well, I think the comics that I would read digitally right would be the ones that basically right now I go through the order form and I'm like No, I mean there's a bunch.

841
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:09,858
Scott: It's like nope.

842
00:47:09,898 --> 00:47:10,079
Scott: Nope.

843
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,124
Scott: Nope, not a chance in hell.

844
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:11,324
Scott: Nope.

845
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:11,545
Scott: Nope.

846
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:12,670
Scott: Nope, not worth a penny.

847
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,140
Scott: No poop poop poop, but there's a bunch that are like.

848
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,191
Scott: I would read that if it was like 25.

849
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:20,138
Rym: so Scott imagine you're at the mocha right?

850
00:47:20,158 --> 00:47:21,623
Rym: Yeah, you own an iPad.

851
00:47:21,904 --> 00:47:23,028
Rym: Yep, and you're walking.

852
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:23,490
Rym: you see a guy.

853
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,274
Rym: He's got something like Black bastard.

854
00:47:26,917 --> 00:47:29,990
Rym: black bastard because like bastard was not the best comic in the world.

855
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:33,924
Rym: But you know what the concept was worth me paying the 50 cents to have it.

856
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,670
Scott: and there's only 50 cents for black bastard.

857
00:47:36,213 --> 00:47:38,466
Rym: There was some ludicrously low price worth every penny.

858
00:47:38,707 --> 00:47:39,190
Rym: Oh my god.

859
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:45,670
Rym: So, you know, we liked those weird like indie things like the weird crap that I would never see this anywhere else.

860
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:46,816
Rym: I'd never think to pick this up.

861
00:47:46,876 --> 00:47:49,810
Rym: It's not even gonna be in my comic book order for most likely.

862
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:50,149
Rym: Yeah.

863
00:47:50,632 --> 00:47:52,780
Rym: now imagine if you see it and you like it like.

864
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,269
Rym: you see he's got just a picture of black bastard and he's like.

865
00:47:55,289 --> 00:48:02,524
Rym: you want to read it and you're like, yeah and You just swipe your credit card on his little device and it charges you five cents.

866
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,250
Rym: and now black bastard is on your iPad.

867
00:48:04,531 --> 00:48:05,073
Scott: That's awesome.

868
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:09,571
Rym: And if every time I would buy a lot more comics that things like the mocha if I didn't have to carry them All.

869
00:48:09,732 --> 00:48:10,997
Scott: yeah, definitely last year.

870
00:48:11,098 --> 00:48:13,770
Rym: I was limited by the fact that I ran out of space in my bag.

871
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:15,489
Scott: Not spit not space in the wallet.

872
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:19,104
Rym: Wallet is not the issue because they're like 50 cents half of those things.

873
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:19,767
Scott: Yeah, right.

874
00:48:19,988 --> 00:48:20,350
Scott: It's great.

875
00:48:20,752 --> 00:48:22,077
Rym: But though I think you're.

876
00:48:22,158 --> 00:48:25,030
Rym: but then again comics like that are almost the comics that could be a webcomic.

877
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:29,923
Scott: Yeah, that too I mean plus, you know if there were more webcomics that were.

878
00:48:30,023 --> 00:48:32,652
Scott: I think there are ways to easily read webcomics on The iPad.

879
00:48:32,672 --> 00:48:41,530
Scott: I think there's a few apps where you can add RSS feeds of comics and stuff like that to To easily, you know You could like turn it on every day and all your newest webcomics would be there and you could swipe through them.

880
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:42,514
Rym: Yeah, it's called Firefox.

881
00:48:42,574 --> 00:48:43,477
Rym: It opens a bunch of tabs.

882
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:46,789
Scott: I'm just saying it's the Firefox isn't on the iPad, you know.

883
00:48:47,352 --> 00:48:51,889
Scott: But yeah that you know, if I had that I would definitely be more convenient to to do that.

884
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:58,875
Rym: Yeah, because even now I have this problem lately if I carry books around to read them all the time and in New York You know, I'm eating over law.

885
00:48:58,916 --> 00:48:59,740
Rym: I'm reading over lunch.

886
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,730
Rym: I'm reading books everywhere on the subway.

887
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,543
Rym: Books get dirty and wrinkled and I bump them into things.

888
00:49:05,563 --> 00:49:08,079
Scott: cuz I'm carrying them everywhere with me But you can still read them.

889
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:13,950
Rym: Yeah, I can still read them But at the same time I would like to have the convenience of not having to carry books around everywhere.

890
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:19,150
Rym: Yeah, I'm actually real close to buying a Kindle or a note just because I don't want to carry physical books anymore.

891
00:49:19,553 --> 00:49:22,330
Scott: So DRM, I know I know you know what I've been doing.

892
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:26,510
Scott: I've been using my the iBooks on the iPhone and you think oh, that's DRM, too.

893
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:26,931
Scott: But you know what?

894
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:27,915
Scott: I don't buy any iBooks.

895
00:49:28,276 --> 00:49:31,206
Scott: the iBooks app is actually you can have it read.

896
00:49:31,246 --> 00:49:32,796
Scott: it can read text files and PDF.

897
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:33,790
Scott: so I got a project Gutenberg.

898
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:38,030
Scott: I get a text file or PDF and I can just read on my phone and it's actually incredibly readable.

899
00:49:38,131 --> 00:49:42,697
Rym: Oh, yeah, I've been using that too on my palm Pre-running web OS.

900
00:49:42,737 --> 00:49:45,607
Scott: if you got a new phone, that's proper then you could do the same thing.

901
00:49:45,628 --> 00:49:46,310
Rym: I'm getting a new phone.

902
00:49:46,813 --> 00:49:47,558
Rym: I probably will.

903
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:48,041
Scott: Yep.

904
00:49:48,725 --> 00:49:48,986
Rym: Yep.

905
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:52,156
Rym: Yep I don't know I. I feel like this is good.

906
00:49:52,517 --> 00:49:57,050
Rym: digital comic distribution is going to explode on let's say within five years.

907
00:49:57,672 --> 00:50:02,590
Scott: Well, I think digital I mean if you count web comics, I think digital, you know digital comics has exploded.

908
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,916
Scott: I think the problem here right is that you basically have like.

909
00:50:04,937 --> 00:50:09,770
Scott: there's like comic readers are like segregated into all these different.

910
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:13,590
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, I'm gonna go back to my Star Trek thing that no one cares about.

911
00:50:14,232 --> 00:50:16,257
Rym: So the Star Trek convention?

912
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:28,270
Rym: there's no outrage and it's kind of like there's two separate worlds of conventions the gigantic Modern conventions run by youth who know about technology and the old-school conventions run by old-school people who didn't keep up with the times.

913
00:50:28,743 --> 00:50:38,864
Rym: Yep the comic industry the superhero comic industry makes all its money on the people who haven't kept up with the times and those people are Extremely averse even if the digital things are perfected.

914
00:50:38,884 --> 00:50:40,110
Scott: They're like, nope gotta have paper.

915
00:50:41,431 --> 00:50:47,270
Rym: By catering to those people they also alienate new people who would probably love their superhero comics.

916
00:50:47,432 --> 00:50:49,067
Scott: Yes, and they're afraid of.

917
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,174
Scott: you know This is a lot of the.

918
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:56,117
Scott: pretty much every business has this problem and I guess this is sort of the thing We were supposed to skip, you know, we said we were skipping right?

919
00:50:56,157 --> 00:51:00,190
Scott: Is that every business that could move digital newspapers comics?

920
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,660
Scott: That right is there simultaneously?

921
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:11,250
Scott: they want to move because that's the way to go But they'll cannibalize the existing old business by making the move to full-on digital.

922
00:51:11,371 --> 00:51:13,341
Scott: But so they dip their toe in the digital.

923
00:51:13,623 --> 00:51:15,010
Scott: but dipping your toe doesn't work.

924
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:16,978
Scott: You can't swim if only your toes in the water.

925
00:51:16,998 --> 00:51:19,910
Scott: You can only swim if your whole body's in the water, right?

926
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:26,205
Scott: There's a chance you may drown Right, but you can't get wet if it would only dip in the toe.

927
00:51:26,265 --> 00:51:27,790
Scott: So they say oh digital failed.

928
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:28,453
Rym: I'm like Scott.

929
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:30,020
Rym: you by definition get wet.

930
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,230
Scott: If you dip your toe, you don't you won't get enough wet.

931
00:51:33,912 --> 00:51:37,470
Scott: I'm just saying you don't get wet enough right to actually get anywhere, right?

932
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:42,206
Scott: So everyone is like dipping their toe in the digital world right as a result.

933
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:43,210
Scott: They're not swimming anywhere.

934
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:44,877
Scott: So they declare digital a failure.

935
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:47,830
Scott: and so they do digital stuff and they don't do it full-on.

936
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:48,873
Scott: So they abandon it.

937
00:51:49,194 --> 00:51:54,314
Rym: and meanwhile Gabe and Tycho and all the webcomic artist if I was Marvel You know what?

938
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:54,737
Scott: I would do.

939
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,370
Scott: I would have the biggest balls in the world.

940
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:04,904
Scott: I would take right all that they have these Marvel and DC both They've got you know, the big ones spider-man Batman Superman x-men Avengers, right?

941
00:52:04,964 --> 00:52:06,710
Scott: I would keep those going for at least a little while.

942
00:52:06,732 --> 00:52:16,113
Scott: Yeah They have all these B and C Level comics that they put out right that are like the hero like the sub heroes the ones that normal people don't know who they Are like the Blue Beetle.

943
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:16,856
Scott: Yeah, like if you.

944
00:52:17,157 --> 00:52:24,006
Scott: exactly right if you buy you all the superheroes that have their own comic books Where if you walk up to someone on the street and you say do you know who X is?

945
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:27,430
Scott: and they say I have no Idea who that is that is a B or C level comic, right?

946
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:32,370
Scott: The only ones I would keep going at least for the start are the a-level ones or everyone knows who they are.

947
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:40,918
Rym: So x-men stuff exactly see like Batman, right all those other ones spider-man I would make them web comics just like penny arcade.

948
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:44,410
Scott: Boom a page X times a week for free on the web.

949
00:52:44,952 --> 00:52:46,399
Scott: You know, I'd be like moon night.

950
00:52:46,439 --> 00:52:47,424
Scott: He's a web comic now.

951
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:48,649
Scott: It's just free at marvel.com.

952
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,843
Scott: I'd go one step further and I wouldn't put it.

953
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:53,807
Scott: they keep and like for example They have Marvel digital and stuff like that.

954
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:55,317
Scott: Marvel digital doesn't.

955
00:52:55,377 --> 00:52:57,410
Scott: if you pay for it, you don't get every comic ever.

956
00:52:57,751 --> 00:53:05,922
Scott: you only get the comics that are in the library right now and they put some in and they take some out and Deep in other people and it's in some weird format.

957
00:53:05,942 --> 00:53:07,930
Scott: You can only read it with the Marvel reader.

958
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:11,850
Scott: It's not just like PDFs or whatever, you know, and people are paying for that.

959
00:53:12,312 --> 00:53:14,706
Scott: So if they've just made I would be like screw that.

960
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:15,490
Scott: it's a web comic.

961
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:20,070
Scott: It's a JPEG on a plain old website with an RSS feed and everything.

962
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:26,010
Rym: I would go one step further and make available from maybe the c-list like the stuff that really isn't worth anything.

963
00:53:26,151 --> 00:53:29,470
Rym: Yep, the entire archives just absolutely open, right?

964
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:37,860
Rym: but I'd watch and any one of those that started getting popular I Would consider having one making it an a title.

965
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:42,222
Scott: Well, no, I wouldn't you know, I would continue to let those things The old ones free but do a reboot.

966
00:53:42,424 --> 00:53:43,270
Scott: No, I wouldn't reboot it.

967
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:44,921
Scott: What I would do is I would those are the ones you.

968
00:53:44,961 --> 00:53:46,370
Scott: basically they're all these free web comics.

969
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:49,310
Scott: It doesn't cost you that much to have the web comic exist, right?

970
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,748
Scott: It's just a website with JPEGs.

971
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:55,290
Scott: Yeah, and if no one reads a webcomic just stop doing it because you have to pay the artist obviously, right?

972
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,289
Scott: So you stop paying the artist in that when you cancel it.

973
00:53:57,611 --> 00:54:04,072
Scott: But if people are reading one of them you monitor very closely how many people are reading each one and if one starts to get Popular.

974
00:54:04,654 --> 00:54:05,859
Scott: make sure they keep writing it.

975
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:08,550
Scott: maybe increase the number of pages per you know.

976
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:11,950
Scott: Maybe make it five pages a week instead of three or instead of one, you know.

977
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:21,010
Scott: And then start bringing out the merch and maybe you know Start putting it in print as in addition to being a webcomic and then maybe sell trades like on Amazon.

978
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:21,191
Scott: If

979
00:54:21,231 --> 00:54:28,112
Rym: the Blue Beetle stuff suddenly is getting really popular then you just announce Hey, if anyone wants to just buy physical copies the Blue Beetle We're doing

980
00:54:28,414 --> 00:54:29,861
Scott: one print run and sell them

981
00:54:30,163 --> 00:54:31,510
Rym: on one time only

982
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:38,530
Scott: Sell them on the website that has the webcomic, you know Blue Beetle or DC.com slash Blue Beetle, whatever.

983
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:40,570
Scott: Yeah, you know that's what I'll be doing.

984
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:45,837
Scott: But there's like they you know, they had to you know Stop making the few thousands.

985
00:54:45,877 --> 00:54:49,690
Scott: They make selling Blue Beetle paper comics in order to do this.

986
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,403
Rym: I also wonder how much money they'd save just on dead trees and distribution.

987
00:54:53,463 --> 00:54:55,310
Scott: I don't know how much the dead trees actually cost.

988
00:54:55,391 --> 00:54:56,237
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

989
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:57,184
Scott: not that I know right.

990
00:54:57,245 --> 00:54:57,970
Rym: I have no idea.

991
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:59,877
Scott: I'm pretty sure that I would.

992
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:03,250
Scott: my guess is that the most of the money they spend is on these artists salary.

993
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:08,809
Rym: So Scott, here's an argument that is going to be made that would destroy all comic book stores.

994
00:55:10,271 --> 00:55:11,354
Rym: Shit well, you know what?

995
00:55:11,996 --> 00:55:12,758
Rym: what happened to music?

996
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:14,062
Scott: stars gone.

997
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:16,669
Rym: Yeah, what happened to blockbuster gone?

998
00:55:19,552 --> 00:55:20,521
Scott: Borders gone.

999
00:55:20,865 --> 00:55:23,053
Rym: the thing is Tonight's doors.

1000
00:55:23,394 --> 00:55:31,932
Scott: If you yeah, it doesn't matter because whether you do this or not comic book stores They're going down to tie it back again, except for the really big ones They're going down.

1001
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:40,809
Rym: if we have the situation where music stores and video stores and comic book stores and gaming stores None of them are viable as stores anymore.

1002
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:55,589
Rym: But if the culture around these things grows due to the fact that distribution is free or cheap and people have a lot of access They'd like imagine if you know All this stuff is free and Superman is a ten times more popular because people who would never buy comics start just reading it.

1003
00:55:56,394 --> 00:56:07,029
Rym: You could probably then get away with having Cultural centers like instead of the old like Greek Patriots house in Queens You've got the Superman house where a bunch of nerds run the Superman Club

1004
00:56:07,512 --> 00:56:07,733
Scott: Mm-hmm,

1005
00:56:08,235 --> 00:56:20,836
Rym: and I think that could be the long tail of the kind of Generified diffuse geek and nerd culture centered in the cities where there's enough Superman fans to have critical mass of a low-level Constant Superman convention.

1006
00:56:20,936 --> 00:56:31,082
Scott: I think you could you could have like the PAX Clubhouse in New York City or Seattle And you could if one person's job to run the clubhouse and everyone out, you know It's just a hangout for those people who are members.

1007
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:32,430
Scott: Oh Scott a membership.

1008
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:41,070
Rym: I just imagined it the penny arcade in like Brooklyn It's just an arcade and a tabletop room and a store and that's it.

1009
00:56:41,971 --> 00:56:46,267
Scott: It sells penny arcade merch and some other stuff that's related like dice that you need.

1010
00:56:46,428 --> 00:56:48,937
Scott: I'd be there I'd be the ball.

1011
00:56:48,977 --> 00:56:49,581
Scott: I'd run the place.

1012
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:54,060
Scott: I'll run the play the manager I'd be the owner founder, whatever.

1013
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,426
Scott: It's my idea.

1014
00:56:55,466 --> 00:56:55,848
Scott: If you do it.

1015
00:56:55,868 --> 00:56:56,250
Scott: I'll sue you.

1016
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,876
Scott: But Yeah, do we have a moral here?

1017
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:02,062
Rym: we've gone on for about an hour.

1018
00:57:02,323 --> 00:57:06,281
Scott: the moral I think is you know It's a similar moral to all digital things, right?

1019
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,370
Scott: It's been over a decade.

1020
00:57:08,631 --> 00:57:10,598
Scott: They've been way too slow and making a move.

1021
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,850
Scott: the webcomic people have a business model has been proven to work.

1022
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:16,649
Scott: Quality web comics will make money and become popular.

1023
00:57:17,891 --> 00:57:21,502
Scott: the print comics need to you know, not just dip their toe in a digital.

1024
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:30,530
Scott: they need to jump in the pool with everybody else and I think you know, we still need though a lot of improvement in the user interface of reading digital comics.

1025
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:40,338
Scott: that's I mean like even people like me who are the most digital are not reading digital comics and paying for paper comics because laws Give it time.

1026
00:57:40,378 --> 00:57:41,790
Scott: because I'm gonna take some time.

1027
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:49,489
Rym: I remember years ago when we would both say things like I don't Carry around mp3 players everywhere because they're really expensive and they kind of suck.

1028
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:56,536
Scott: Yeah, like the for the diamond Rio, yeah, I thought there was a time I bought an iPod mini.

1029
00:57:56,636 --> 00:57:57,057
Scott: All right.

1030
00:57:57,118 --> 00:57:58,582
Scott: Yeah or gigabytes.

1031
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,087
Scott: Yeah, and that was that was good.

1032
00:58:00,107 --> 00:58:00,830
Scott: That was when it was good.

1033
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:04,519
Rym: We're not even at the iPod mini level of comic readers yet.

1034
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:06,003
Rym: That's the argument.

1035
00:58:06,063 --> 00:58:06,524
Rym: I'm making.

1036
00:58:06,825 --> 00:58:08,670
Rym: we're barely like we're past the Rio.

1037
00:58:09,492 --> 00:58:10,903
Rym: The Rio is my laptop.

1038
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:14,588
Rym: Yeah That's for sure, but we're not there yet.

1039
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:22,870
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1040
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:27,650
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

00:58:50,346 --> 00:58:51,630
Scott: It's actually recorded at night.
