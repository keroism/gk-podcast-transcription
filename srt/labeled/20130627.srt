1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,489
Rym: It's Thursday, June 27th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:10,670
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,707 --> 00:00:14,138
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,503
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:16,746
Rym: Tonight, we're back.

6
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:17,768
Rym: We're bad.

7
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,880
Rym: We're talking about Robert's Rules of Order and parliamentary procedure.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,920
Rym: Fascinating.

9
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:27,217
Scott: Let's do this.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,417
Rym: Yup, so I spent the last six or so days in the Midwest.

11
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:34,779
Scott: That's a shame.

12
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:40,600
Rym: In Chicago, Madison, Saginaw, Detroit, New Baltimore, going all around.

13
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:41,768
Rym: I saw my dad.

14
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:42,999
Rym: I haven't seen him in quite some time.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,267
Rym: Saw my grandpa.

16
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:45,720
Rym: Haven't seen him in quite some time.

17
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,960
Rym: He was happy to tell stories because I brought Emily along.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:56,320
Rym: So instead of just, "Hey, grandpa, this is what I'm up to," he basically got to retell every good story from his childhood all over again to a new audience.

19
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:58,780
Scott: I'm sorry you had to leave the city.

20
00:00:59,441 --> 00:00:59,822
Rym: You know what?

21
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:00,907
Rym: It was not that bad.

22
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,720
Rym: It was an experience because I haven't been to Michigan in a while.

23
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:04,184
Rym: Yeah.

24
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:06,100
Scott: How was the driving everywhere?

25
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:09,479
Rym: Not that bad because the speed limit's 70 and up.

26
00:01:11,124 --> 00:01:13,156
Scott: How was not being able to get food at 2

27
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:13,398
Scott: a.m.?

28
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:14,722
Scott: ?

29
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:16,053
Rym: I just stayed in at 2 a.m.

30
00:01:16,073 --> 00:01:16,840
Scott: for a run.

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,719
Scott: That sucks.

32
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,756
Rym: It's funny because I got there and we went to Wisconsin and we went to this wedding.

33
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:22,560
Rym: It was a great time.

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,297
Rym: And then we flew to Detroit and we drove around.

35
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:25,800
Rym: We did our thing.

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,280
Rym: But we got into Detroit at 9 o'clock at night and we're driving to my dad's house.

37
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:33,420
Rym: I actually kind of remembered my way around Michigan, which kind of worked.

38
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:34,638
Scott: I know where to go in Connecticut.

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,980
Rym: Well, the roads are just a big grid so you can navigate by dead reckoning.

40
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:42,560
Rym: So we're hungry, hadn't eaten dinner really, and we're looking for some food.

41
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:44,352
Rym: I'm like, "Oh, we'll go to a Coney Island

42
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:44,513
Rym: diner.".

43
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,880
Rym: But a Coney Island's a particular kind of diner that you really only get in that area.

44
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:52,241
Rym: But yeah, they all close at like 10.

45
00:01:52,241 --> 00:02:00,560
Rym: I knew of two that were 24/7, but they were way up in Sterling Heights and we were actually going around Sterling Heights up to our new Baltimore.

46
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,084
Rym: Yeah, it was nostalgic.

47
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,360
Scott: Is it still Sterling Whites even today?

48
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,120
Rym: So a lot of Chaldeans have continued to move into that area.

49
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:10,779
Scott: Okay.

50
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,338
Rym: Do you know what a Chaldean is?

51
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:19,580
Scott: You said that specifically to challenge my knowledge of Chaldean people.

52
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:20,539
Rym: I did.

53
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,655
Scott: But I know that there's an island of Greece, I believe, Chaldea.

54
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:26,040
Scott: Is that correct?

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,620
Rym: Keep going.

56
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:30,499
Scott: Yeah, I live in Astoria, I know Greek things, that's all I know.

57
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,020
Scott: There's an island in Greece that's called Chaldea, am I right?

58
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:34,740
Rym: That is in fact true.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,550
Scott: Yes, and the people are from there.

60
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:37,899
Scott: That's all I know.

61
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:46,400
Rym: They are basically an old race of Syrian Christians who were somewhat displaced and don't really have a homeland.

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,440
Scott: So Greek people don't live in the island, but it is a Greek island that belongs to the country of Greece.

63
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,520
Rym: I don't actually know if they are from that island specifically.

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,800
Rym: I just knew that they were Christians who were displaced from Mesopotamia and parts of what eventually became Rome.

65
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,140
Scott: Yeah, countries where things are actually old, not like our piece of shit country.

66
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:07,240
Rym: All right, I guess there's a lot of them today.

67
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,663
Rym: I filled up the Wikipedia article.

68
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:14,760
Rym: in Iraq and Syria, so things continue to go great for the Chaldeans.

69
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:20,120
Rym: Here, their homeland, migrant Chaldo-Syrian Catholic communities are found in the United States.

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Rym: I'll link to the Wikipedia, you guys can all read it, but a lot of Chaldeans have moved to Sterling Heights and have been for some time.

71
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,320
Scott: That's a good place to move, much better than Syria and Iraq.

72
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:44,300
Rym: But the things I can say about the Midwest, not my family or whatever, is that I forgot just how important trick-taking card games are to people in that area.

73
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:49,700
Rym: You sit down, not even old people, young people, every people, you play hearts.

74
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,860
Rym: Euchre is kind of a kid's game, because unless you cheat, it's a solved game.

75
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,277
Rym: But they were all the family, Emily's family, they were all really into pinochle.

76
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:58,760
Scott: I love pinochle.

77
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,420
Rym: I don't really like pinochle that much, I don't even know it that well.

78
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,820
Scott: You need a special deck of cards, you gotta take a bunch of cards.

79
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,720
Rym: It's just two Euchre decks.

80
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,800
Rym: But Scott, no one calls it pinochle, like if you were in Connecticut, it's pinochle.

81
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:12,840
Scott: New York people call it pinochle.

82
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,660
Rym: Yeah, the majority of pinochle playing peoples call it pinochle.

83
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,276
Scott: Pinochle.

84
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:17,998
Rym: Pinochle.

85
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:27,420
Rym: But I don't like pinochle, nor have I played it in the last decade and a half, so we played hearts, but we had five people.

86
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:32,820
Rym: So we played a pretty bastard cutthroat iteration of hearts.

87
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,900
Scott: How do you play hearts with five people?

88
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:35,924
Rym: Oh, it's simple.

89
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:38,400
Rym: The same way you play with three people with a little variation.

90
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,890
Scott: How do you play with three people?

91
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,120
Scott: It's a four people game, period.

92
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,900
Scott: It's not like one to four, it's four.

93
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,621
Rym: Actually, no.

94
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:47,877
Rym: And if you read any literature on it, three to five is kind of the accepted ratio.

95
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,820
Scott: I've never played a hearts that wasn't a four people heart.

96
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,702
Rym: So four is standard hearts.

97
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:57,280
Rym: In three player hearts, you play the same way, but the leftover card just kind of goes off to the side.

98
00:04:57,602 --> 00:05:01,100
Rym: And the first person to take a heart in a trick gets whatever the fuck that card was.

99
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,760
Scott: Oh, that fucker is like the queen of spades.

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,307
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

101
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:04,260
Rym: Shit sucks sometimes.

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,097
Rym: So with five player, you do not, basically, whoever...

103
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,640
Scott: How do you pass at the beginning?

104
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,419
Rym: So one to the left, two to the left, three to the left, four to the left, hold 'em.

105
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:17,823
Scott: Whoa.

106
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:18,978
Scott: That's a lot of passing.

107
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:19,801
Scott: Yeah.

108
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:24,120
Rym: More importantly, you do not start with the two of clubs.

109
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,120
Rym: You start with whoever is to the left of the dealer, and they lead whatever the fuck they want.

110
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:29,859
Rym: Unless it's a heart.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,302
Scott: You know what?

112
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,700
Scott: If it's one to the left, two to the left, three to the left, four to the left, hold 'em.

113
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:33,029
Rym: Yeah?

114
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,960
Scott: What I would do is I basically get rid of my fifth worst card, then my fifth and fourth worst card, and so on.

115
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,443
Rym: Well, no, no, no.

116
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:41,630
Rym: That's good, Scott.

117
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,315
Rym: No, no, no.

118
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:43,140
Rym: You're not getting this.

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,229
Rym: You pass three cards, one to the left.

120
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,500
Rym: Next hand, three cards, two to the left.

121
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,214
Rym: No, I didn't see where you were going with that.

122
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:50,960
Rym: That's not what's going on.

123
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,400
Scott: 'Cause then I would save up to build the four evilest cards and pass them all at once in the last.

124
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,559
Rym: But Emily had never really played hearts before, and it was a bunch of Michiganders, including me.

125
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:04,220
Rym: You know, my dad was like the shark of hearts.

126
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,365
Rym: So it was kind of rough for Emily.

127
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:12,577
Rym: We start playing, and she'd play a card, and everyone's like, "T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.

128
00:06:12,597 --> 00:06:13,359
Rym: Don't want to play

129
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:13,740
Rym: that.".

130
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:14,463
Rym: She's like,

131
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:14,925
Rym: "Why?".

132
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:15,548
Rym: Bam!

133
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:16,050
Rym: Queen!

134
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:16,914
Rym: All the hearts.

135
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:17,838
Rym: It was brutal.

136
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,996
Scott: Yeah, what's wrong with you?

137
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:19,941
Scott: She learned quickly.

138
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:29,020
Rym: Well, the thing is, it worked out, because the way that game works, remember, whoever goes over the edge ends the game, and whoever's the lowest score wins.

139
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,346
Rym: So you can't just pick on the noob.

140
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:36,439
Rym: You pick on the noob to a point, and then everyone's protecting the noob, 'cause they don't want the game to end.

141
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:43,960
Rym: But she caught on quick, but I gotta tell you, five-player hearts, which I've not played often, the only other thing, there's two cards in that kitty.

142
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,466
Rym: So hearts getting broken can be pretty goddamn dangerous.

143
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:55,200
Rym: And it's highly likely that even in the first hand, someone has de-suited themselves of at least one suit.

144
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,379
Rym: Sometimes multiple suits.

145
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,499
Rym: So if you pass someone three diamonds, they're fucked.

146
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:04,587
Rym: It was a good time to be had.

147
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:07,720
Rym: Hearts is a, I think we did a show on hearts, so go listen to that show on hearts.

148
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:14,612
Scott: While you're away, I played Netrunner, I cook food, I eat food.

149
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:18,580
Scott: Oh, actually, I went to the Whitney Museum I never went to before.

150
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:28,760
Scott: They have an exhibit from Edward Hopper, who I didn't know, and he painted that Nighthawks picture, which I used to, which I was stupid, and I thought Norman Rockwell did that.

151
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,640
Scott: You know, the people sitting in the diner picture.

152
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:35,015
Rym: I always kind of thought Norman Rockwell did that too, so don't feel bad.

153
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,619
Scott: Edward Hopper did it, and the thing about this exhibit that they have there.

154
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,599
Rym: The thing is, to this day, all I can think about that picture is someone photoshopped in a broken window, and a chair, and an anteater being like, "Come at me,

155
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:47,719
Rym: bro.".

156
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,341
Scott: Right.

157
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:59,280
Scott: Anyway, at the museum, they not only have all these paintings there, many of which are as incredible as that one, but it shows you all the preparatory drawings he did.

158
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:08,500
Scott: So you go into a room, it has this painting, and all along the walls in the rest of the room are all the drawings he did on other papers to help get ready for this one painting and build up to it.

159
00:08:08,962 --> 00:08:11,235
Scott: And I've never really seen that before in a museum.

160
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:12,000
Scott: It was pretty awesome.

161
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:20,100
Scott: It was also interesting, they had a wall that showed a timeline of his history, and it was that usually it's like some artist is troubled and whatnot, right?

162
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,120
Scott: His history, even though he was like around 100 years ago, was so like our histories.

163
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:35,499
Scott: It was like, "Yup, dude, grew up, you know, went to school, went to art school, got a job as an illustrator, didn't really like

164
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:35,578
Scott: it.".

165
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:44,320
Scott: Went to what basically sounded like the equivalent of mocha of the day, sold his first painting, switched over to painting.

166
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,476
Scott: It's like, "Dude went to college, learned his skills, was really fucking good at it, did it a

167
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:48,778
Scott: lot.".

168
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:51,732
Scott: And I was like, "Oh, that's reassuring.

169
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:52,657
Scott: I like that

170
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:52,999
Scott: story.".

171
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:55,100
Rym: So maybe we'll make it someday, little brother.

172
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,356
Scott: Paint a painting famous not to be in a museum?

173
00:08:59,436 --> 00:08:59,899
Scott: Unlikely.

174
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,550
Rym: But yeah, I mean, I was in Michigan, people say pop there instead of soda.

175
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:07,620
Rym: They say I-75 instead of just 75.

176
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,760
Rym: Google didn't know how to pronounce the names of pretty much any streets.

177
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,837
Rym: It's like, "Turn right on Gratiot Avenue,

178
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:13,877
Rym: M53.".

179
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:17,689
Rym: The thing is, there's really no way to know.

180
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,599
Rym: it's pronounced grash-it unless you live there.

181
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:25,160
Rym: Like, remember we were playing Train Game?

182
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,260
Scott: Ticket to Ride?

183
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,894
Rym: Ticket to Ride, and you were like Mackinac Island, or Salt St.

184
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:30,255
Rym: Mary.

185
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,299
Rym: There's just no way to know.

186
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:34,197
Scott: I think you could know Sault St.

187
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:34,440
Scott: Marie.

188
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,577
Rym: Most people don't know.

189
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,080
Scott: But Mackinac, yeah, it ends with A-C-K, I'm pretty sure.

190
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:39,747
Rym: That's pronounced

191
00:09:40,215 --> 00:09:40,276
Rym: "aww.".

192
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:42,578
Scott: Yeah, C-K, not pronounced

193
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:42,760
Scott: "wuh.".

194
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:47,760
Scott: That's a C and a K. A C and a K does not equal a couple W's.

195
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,400
Rym: But I had one observation.

196
00:09:50,961 --> 00:10:00,180
Rym: My family's there, and I grew up in Michigan, and it was fun to take Emily over to like, "Well, there's the high school I went to, and that's the park I'd go fuck around in, and these are all the places.

197
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:03,275
Rym: These are three of the houses I grew up in as a

198
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:03,537
Rym: kid.".

199
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:11,840
Rym: But a significant portion of the people that I would see around were, shall we say, rotund.

200
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:17,700
Rym: And more importantly, a simple observation.

201
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,420
Rym: When we went to a diner, and this diner is called Ciro's, and it is a Greek diner.

202
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,299
Rym: There's a lot of Greek diners in Michigan, like they're a thing there.

203
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,980
Rym: Ciro's is the same diner that my grandparents would take me when I was like four.

204
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,800
Rym: It's been there forever.

205
00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:38,800
Rym: As far as I can tell, it has the same menus from back then.

206
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,218
Rym: Because the menu still says, "Please, no cigar or pipe

207
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:43,700
Rym: smoking."

208
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:47,020
Rym: Even though smoking's not a thing in restaurants there anymore.

209
00:10:48,183 --> 00:10:50,119
Rym: And it pretty much looked like the same menu.

210
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:56,080
Rym: So that was very nostalgic, but the portion sizes are easily triple the New York portion size.

211
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,480
Scott: You can get some big portions in New York, especially at like an Italian restaurant.

212
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,300
Rym: No dude, go to the diner down the street, Court Square Diner or whatever, right?

213
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:04,000
Scott: You get a normal average kind of portion.

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,847
Rym: Yeah, get an omelet.

215
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,480
Rym: You get like a three egg omelet.

216
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,611
Rym: This must have been a 13 egg omelet.

217
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:10,380
Rym: It covered the entire plate.

218
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:12,880
Scott: How is this place not losing money hand over fist?

219
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,240
Rym: I paid $5.95 for that thing, and it came with home fries.

220
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,920
Scott: I mean, eggs are cheap, but if they give you just three eggs, they can make even more fucking money.

221
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,680
Rym: $15 bought me enough food to feed us for days.

222
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:29,259
Rym: But I also ate at a Big Boy, but unlike the time...

223
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,677
Scott: Doesn't sound like there's any high quality restaurants out there, Big Boy Diner with no old menu.

224
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,920
Rym: It was very nostalgic to me to eat at these places, because when I was in high school...

225
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,720
Scott: I thought Big Boy was here at the most hated place for you to eat.

226
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:40,940
Rym: No, so I don't think you know about Big Boy.

227
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:41,859
Scott: I know about Big Boy.

228
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:43,359
Rym: Tell me about Big Boy.

229
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:46,580
Scott: It's sort of like a generic diner with that big statue outside.

230
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:49,574
Rym: No, that doesn't really tell.

231
00:11:49,614 --> 00:11:50,359
Rym: So Big Boy...

232
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,040
Scott: Remember we ate at one on the way to Panguicon?

233
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,762
Rym: Yes, we did.

234
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:53,686
Rym: It was pretty good.

235
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:55,293
Rym: It wasn't on the way to Panguicon.

236
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:57,040
Rym: It was across the street from Panguicon.

237
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:57,453
Scott: Oh, right.

238
00:11:58,981 --> 00:12:00,460
Rym: We also ate at that Coney Island Diner.

239
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,699
Scott: So here's Mexican place.

240
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,480
Rym: The Big Boy we ate at at that rest stop wasn't really a Big Boy like the ones in Southeast Michigan.

241
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,080
Rym: Because Big Boy was the name of a burger before the Big Mac existed.

242
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:18,380
Rym: And it's arguable that the Big Mac was based on the Big Boy.

243
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:19,622
Rym: Yeah.

244
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:21,357
Rym: So the Big Mac...

245
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,199
Scott: So I'm not going to eat either one of those.

246
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,823
Rym: Oh, yeah.

247
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:28,400
Rym: But the Big Boy was basically... There were diners and they would have the Big Boy and it was named.

248
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,800
Rym: There's a whole story about how it was named or whatever.

249
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,175
Rym: And then some illustrator drew Big Boy.

250
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:34,929
Rym: But he doesn't look like that Big Boy.

251
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,820
Rym: you saw standing outside holding up the burger.

252
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:40,059
Rym: He's kind of this fat looking kid instead.

253
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,540
Rym: Long story short, Big Boy became a sort of widely infringed upon trademark.

254
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,740
Rym: So the people who had the original trademark went around and made deals with all these people who were fucking around with it to franchise it for real.

255
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:56,689
Rym: So they weren't franchises like you.

256
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:58,700
Rym: open a subway and it's like all other subways.

257
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,840
Rym: Shoney's was a Big Boy for a long time.

258
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:02,799
Rym: All those chains...

259
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,919
Scott: I thought Shoney's was just Shoney's.

260
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,100
Rym: I used it for a while.

261
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:13,940
Rym: It was Shoney's Big Boy or Elias Brothers Big Boy or Fritz's Big Boy or Bob's Big Boy.

262
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,419
Rym: Big Boy was a chain of chains.

263
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,320
Rym: It was a chain that would be like you've got the Big Boy menu and you might have your own shit too.

264
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,879
Rym: We make the Big Boy menu stuff in a central place and give it to you.

265
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:34,760
Rym: Big Boy's basically had this awful sort of chili and this awful chili hamburger and this awful chili hot dog and the Big Boy Big Mac.

266
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:44,820
Rym: And there's this crazy long story of Big Boy and it's very... The Big Boy we ate at on that road trip that we'll never be spoken of again was not an Elias Brothers Big Boy.

267
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,560
Rym: It was basically a shit boy.

268
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:58,280
Rym: All that along the way, we're in Michigan so I didn't really have internet access so much so I didn't really get to talk on the internet much about all the crazy bullshit that went down politically.

269
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,839
Rym: The Supreme Court shot down two anti-gay marriage things.

270
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,578
Rym: So we won two things.

271
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:15,560
Rym: And it also shot down the provision of the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act that said former slave states have to get permission before they get super racist in their voting laws.

272
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,753
Scott: So both these things are 5-4, right?

273
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:26,180
Scott: That means that there are basically four people on the Supreme Court who are not racist and not homophobes.

274
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,860
Scott: There are four people who are racist and homophobes and there's one person who is not a homophobe but is a racist.

275
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,705
Rym: You might say that he's a switch hitter.

276
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:39,280
Rym: He goes both ways on these issues.

277
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,880
Scott: He likes gays but not black people and Hispanics.

278
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:55,660
Rym: Well the thing is, he was consistent in a few ways in that they upheld states' rights in two of these decisions, a states' right to make their own voting laws however racist they might be.

279
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:04,920
Rym: In the idea that that state, if they make a racist voting law, there'll be a lawsuit in that state and it'll come back up to the Supreme Court and they can say that specific law is racist.

280
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:12,640
Scott: In other words, they can be racist until someone tells them not to instead of preventing them from being racist in the first place.

281
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Rym: They can be racist for one election and then we'll fix it.

282
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,120
Scott: And then they'll just be racist in a different way the next election and they'll have to fix it again.

283
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:27,560
Rym: But coupled with all this, we expected these rulings and they pretty much shook down exactly the way we expected.

284
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,260
Rym: I mean, the standing thing, Proposition 8 was guaranteed to go down in the way it went down.

285
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:43,220
Rym: They basically said the people who were continuing the appeals didn't have the right to continue the appeals because they were not affected, because they were straight people not trying to get gay married.

286
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:47,868
Rym: The only people who had standing were the gay people who wanted to get married.

287
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:54,180
Rym: that couldn't and the state who refused to continue to defend the bullshit law.

288
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,914
Rym: So the court was like, "Yeah, you people who are anti-gay have no right to even contest this.

289
00:15:59,954 --> 00:16:01,398
Rym: It doesn't affect you because you're not

290
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:01,679
Rym: gay.".

291
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,501
Rym: So, boop!

292
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:09,620
Rym: But the other one was a federal thing, but the civil rights one was, again, it was a states' right to determine its own stuff.

293
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:16,480
Rym: So, pretty much we're going to see more lawsuits now that are going to be interpreted based on some things that happen here.

294
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:20,800
Rym: And gay marriage is going to be forced out everywhere, but all of that was expected.

295
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:28,200
Rym: What I did not expect was that crazy-ass filibuster of that ridiculous abortion bill in Texas.

296
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,925
Rym: I saw what happened.

297
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:31,808
Rym: I went to bed.

298
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:35,800
Rym: I'm sleeping in Emily's grandmother's house.

299
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,011
Rym: She let us use her bed.

300
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:37,980
Rym: She wanted us to leave in the basement.

301
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:44,616
Rym: And I'm laying there with my one bar of 3G Twitter and I'm like, "Oh, there's a filibuster against that abortion bill.

302
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:46,020
Rym: Oh, this is getting kind of epic.

303
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:48,066
Rym: Oh, she failed on a technicality.

304
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:48,226
Rym: That

305
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:48,547
Rym: sucks.".

306
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:49,149
Rym: And I went to bed.

307
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:52,300
Rym: Then I wake up and see all the crazy drama that went down.

308
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,240
Scott: Yeah, I only pay the smallest amount of attention to those things because I got better shit to do.

309
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,060
Rym: You should have paid attention to this one.

310
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,906
Rym: Because I can affect it somehow?

311
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:03,452
Scott: Because it affects me?

312
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:04,454
Scott: I don't live in Texas.

313
00:17:04,596 --> 00:17:05,760
Scott: Nor should anyone else.

314
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:08,142
Rym: Well, it taught me two things.

315
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:20,420
Rym: One, the Republicans in Texas are perfectly willing to break the laws and break their own rules that they've already made to be stacked in their favor to prevent someone else from winning.

316
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,712
Rym: So if you rig the game and you're about to lose, you're willing to just cheat.

317
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,619
Rym: I feel like people should go to jail over what they tried to do.

318
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,012
Rym: They basically tried to just move the clock and lie about what happened.

319
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,080
Rym: Kind of relevant to the second half of the show.

320
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:41,580
Rym: But really, what this all comes down to is that former slave states are pretty much universally shitholes in one way or another.

321
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,278
Rym: And if you're smart, you should really just try to get out of those states.

322
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:48,760
Scott: Can we pass some sort of like, I don't know if it would take an amendment or a law.

323
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,013
Rym: Undo the Civil War and be like, "You know

324
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:50,236
Rym: what?".

325
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,746
Scott: No, the law, it should be simply the federal government, right?

326
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:56,310
Scott: The executive branch of the federal government.

327
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,820
Scott: If they think that anything your state does is racist, you get zero federal funding, but you still have to pay taxes.

328
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,265
Scott: Everyone in your state is supposed to pay taxes.

329
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:05,616
Scott: You get zero dollars from any federal program, period.

330
00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:06,319
Scott: Doesn't matter what it is.

331
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,368
Scott: You get no dollars, no bridges, no highways, no nothing.

332
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:11,450
Scott: Every single educate.

333
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,473
Scott: It doesn't even matter what it is.

334
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:13,455
Scott: Water, sewage.

335
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:15,860
Scott: You get no federal money whatsoever.

336
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,469
Scott: You still have to pay taxes if you do anything that is racist or homophobic whatsoever.

337
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:23,835
Scott: Even one law on your books that is racist, you shut down.

338
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,300
Scott: Your state is basically going to turn into a ruined shithole.

339
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:28,659
Scott: Unless you fix your shit up.

340
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,340
Rym: Well, Congress kind of has a power like that in the sense that, remember with the whole speed limit thing?

341
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:36,120
Scott: Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

342
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,420
Rym: They withhold specific federal funds if certain requirements weren't met.

343
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,747
Scott: Your state is, we're not going to make you secede.

344
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,038
Scott: We're not going to dump you, but we're basically going to say, "Yeah, we're going to ruin your state

345
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:45,560
Scott: completely.".

346
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,239
Scott: Unless you stop being racist shithole.

347
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,460
Rym: I'm pretty sure they're ruining their states pretty well on their own.

348
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,336
Scott: Yeah, but I'm saying we just basically bring it about quicker, right?

349
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:53,738
Scott: That way...

350
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,024
Rym: Oh, Scott, you want to bring it about quicker?

351
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:56,649
Rym: There's a much easier way to do that.

352
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,540
Rym: I'm not saying we should do this, but all we would have to do...

353
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,657
Scott: To states like Arizona, we could be like, "Turn it off the water,

354
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:01,899
Scott: guys.".

355
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,002
Rym: No, it's simple.

356
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:06,287
Rym: All you would have to do, Texas would be the only one to kind of come out.

357
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:13,519
Rym: okay, I think, is you just say, "All right, if you want fair taxation, you only get out of the federal government however much your state paid

358
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:13,639
Rym: in.".

359
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:15,360
Scott: Oh, that's a shame.

360
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,611
Rym: I mean, states' rights, self-determination.

361
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:18,618
Rym: If you don't want to be taxed...

362
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:20,539
Scott: That sucks, Alaska, Hawaii.

363
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:24,080
Rym: Hawaii might actually be okay.

364
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,457
Scott: Well, they don't need as much, but...

365
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:30,659
Rym: Pretty sure that a lot of the red states... How's that Wyoming doing?

366
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:42,380
Rym: But regardless, all of that was interesting, and if you ignore politics, whatever, but at least read the details of what happened in the filibuster overnight in Tejas.

367
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:46,640
Scott: If you consider politics a game, like a D&D kind of game, it's interesting.

368
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:54,320
Rym: Well, it's especially interesting because the game's rules are X. They're designed to protect old, scared white men.

369
00:19:56,442 --> 00:20:00,080
Rym: A woman was about to win the game anyway, so they just cheated.

370
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:09,880
Rym: It'd be like if we played Puerto Rico, and the rule was if you're white and old, you start with seven doubloons, and someone was about to win anyway, so I just reached in and started taking doubloons out of the box.

371
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:13,120
Scott: You gotta be pretty shitty at the game to lose if you start with seven doubloons.

372
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,320
Rym: I know, there's only one person filibustering.

373
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,249
Scott: Turn one, build a factory.

374
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,279
Scott: I just love that the balloon left.

375
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,520
Rym: Plus, I mean, really, Strom Thurmond filibustered the Civil Rights Act.

376
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:20,862
Scott: You know what?

377
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:23,180
Scott: On turn one, the university might actually be more powerful.

378
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,720
Scott: Turn one, university.

379
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,489
Scott: Someone's gonna settle.

380
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:28,459
Scott: You know it's gonna happen.

381
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,707
Rym: But anyway, yay gay marriage.

382
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,013
Rym: It's happening.

383
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:32,897
Rym: Gay is happening.

384
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:33,580
Rym: It's coming out.

385
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,478
Rym: It's happening.

386
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:38,260
Rym: So you got anything?

387
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:41,120
Scott: Did I do a news of some kind?

388
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,663
Rym: You got anything?

389
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:42,327
Rym: It's Thursday.

390
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,553
Rym: It's the lounge.

391
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:44,760
Rym: You can talk about whatever you want.

392
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,060
Scott: I thought I did a news of some kind already, didn't I?

393
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:48,248
Rym: We just got to talking.

394
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:49,360
Rym: You went to that museum, I guess.

395
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,720
Scott: Yeah, I can't even tell what's open event and what's news anymore.

396
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,965
Rym: It's Thursday.

397
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,535
Rym: We're just chilling, hanging out.

398
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:56,280
Rym: It's the lounge.

399
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:56,932
Scott: It's your mom.

400
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:06,200
Rym: The only other thing I have to say is that I've often taken red-eye flights, and for the first time ever, I took a morning flight.

401
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:08,024
Rym: Fuck morning flights.

402
00:21:08,124 --> 00:21:13,080
Rym: I would rather fly overnight than get up in the morning and fly somewhere.

403
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:14,840
Scott: I've had a lot of morning flights.

404
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,519
Rym: I do not like morning flights, especially when I basically flew in and then went straight to work.

405
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:21,420
Scott: I'm not that early in the morning.

406
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:24,319
Rym: I'm running on fumes and Red Bull right now.

407
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:28,780
Rym: Also, Spirit Air can eat a big old dick.

408
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,700
Scott: Why are you flying some weird ass shitty airline?

409
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,120
Scott: So Spirit Air is... You get what you deserve for buying a ticket from a weird airline.

410
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,350
Rym: I think we flew Delta, all the rest, which is fine.

411
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,500
Rym: They're, you know, they're hubbed out that area, so it worked out.

412
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,205
Rym: And I was in all these different airports.

413
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:43,880
Rym: I was in O'Hare, Midway, Milwaukee, all these airports.

414
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,475
Rym: But Spirit Air, seriously, eat a big old dick.

415
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,140
Rym: Here's Spirit Air's scam.

416
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,636
Rym: Now, it's an obvious scam if you know what they're doing, but it's a scam.

417
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:55,279
Rym: Fuck them.

418
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,320
Rym: Airlines like to lie about their fares.

419
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:00,840
Rym: They also like to hide their fares.

420
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:00,965
Rym: No.

421
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:08,040
Rym: Because they don't want you using things like Expedia or Google or Kayak to just see like, well, who has the cheapest flight?

422
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,180
Rym: So Spirit's one of those budget fucking airlines.

423
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,499
Scott: Which means not actually budget.

424
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,199
Rym: That'll have a really low price, but then they charge you a hundred bucks at the gate for a carry on.

425
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:26,920
Rym: If you register that carry on before you get to the airport, then it's like thirty five bucks.

426
00:22:27,423 --> 00:22:28,060
Scott: Is that legal?

427
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,478
Rym: Technically, yes.

428
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,410
Rym: They also charge you for each checked bag.

429
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:34,640
Rym: And if it's over a certain amount, then they charge you for that.

430
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,063
Rym: And it's it's crazy.

431
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:42,580
Rym: But basically, they hope that someone will forget to actually register their bag when they check in.

432
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:48,740
Rym: And then they get there and it's like, oh, well, you can either pay us a hundred bucks or throw that bag away.

433
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,960
Rym: So while we did not get caught by that, fuck Spirit Airlines.

434
00:22:55,162 --> 00:22:57,579
Scott: I don't know why you're flying some non JetBlue Airlines.

435
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,208
Rym: Yeah, we booked all this stuff all over the place.

436
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:01,492
Rym: Also flying to the Midwest.

437
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:03,540
Rym: JetBlue does not go to the Midwest.

438
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,660
Scott: Another reason never to fly anything that is not JetBlue.

439
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,064
Rym: But Scott, I got family there.

440
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:13,040
Rym: If your mom or your grandma was in the Midwest, would you just never visit her again?

441
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:13,612
Scott: Yes.

442
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:17,180
Rym: OK, I will go to the Midwest to see my dad and my grandfather.

443
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:18,870
Scott: They can come here.

444
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,180
Scott: It's actually better for them to come here.

445
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,940
Rym: Well, my grandpa is going to move to Arizona with my mom, which I think would be cool.

446
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,800
Rym: But I'm trying to get my dad to come to New York.

447
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,439
Scott: Pretty sure JetBlue goes to Arizona.

448
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,160
Rym: I'm going to fly to Arizona or Seattle on JetBlue than it is to fly to Detroit on basically any airline.

449
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,560
Rym: Ding, ding.

450
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,039
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

451
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:46,014
Scott: I think you had a lot of days to pick up a thing.

452
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:46,739
Scott: What did you pick up?

453
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,439
Rym: So I'm using a really old thing.

454
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:48,820
Rym: Great.

455
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:52,740
Rym: Prepare to be a little bit creeped out if you don't know what the deal is.

456
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,818
Rym: Scott, do you know what a potter's field is?

457
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,238
Scott: A potter's field?

458
00:23:57,404 --> 00:23:58,620
Scott: Is that like in Crying Freeman?

459
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:11,260
Rym: So I was one day I was talking about City Island, which is basically this weird sort of beach town in New York City, like in the Bronx.

460
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:12,899
Rym: Like there's the Bronx.

461
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,080
Rym: And on the east side of the Bronx, there's this huge park by Pelham Bay.

462
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,740
Rym: And if you drive all the way out through this park, there's basically like Wildwood.

463
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:24,000
Rym: It's like this beach town with beaches and beach houses.

464
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:25,150
Rym: So is Rockaway.

465
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,119
Scott: So is Long Beach.

466
00:24:26,402 --> 00:24:28,599
Rym: Yeah, but Rockaway and Long Beach are like the coastal...

467
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,999
Scott: Howard Beach, a little fancier.

468
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,800
Rym: They're south and they're coastal and they're a little different.

469
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:40,220
Rym: City Island, because it's in the Bronx and it's on the north side, like it's not down like by Long Beach.

470
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,180
Rym: It's like up in this place that people wouldn't think there's beaches.

471
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,339
Rym: Like people don't think, "Oh, I live in the Bronx," and there's a beach right there.

472
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,819
Rym: But anyway, I was talking about this place.

473
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:53,480
Rym: So I'm zooming in on Google Maps because I've only been there once just to kind of look at it while I'm talking.

474
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,680
Rym: And I see this little island next to it called Heart Island with an A, like a deer, you know, a heart.

475
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:03,080
Rym: And I see at the top, there's like a park symbol and it says Potter's Field.

476
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,658
Rym: So I hover over it because I'm like, "Oh, maybe there's like camping

477
00:25:06,698 --> 00:25:06,859
Rym: there.".

478
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:09,440
Rym: And it pops up five reviews.

479
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:11,818
Rym: Here's the review that Google gives me.

480
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,527
Rym: "Great place to drop off dead hookers.

481
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,272
Rym: Excellent service.

482
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:17,457
Rym: Repeat customer.

483
00:25:17,577 --> 00:25:18,099
Rym: Very, very

484
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,480
Rym: impressed.".

485
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:19,802
Rym: Huh.

486
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:23,800
Rym: So I click on this and I click on the five reviews.

487
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,978
Rym: Ah, here's the second review.

488
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,951
Rym: "Since I was a child, I've been fascinated with dead things.

489
00:25:29,514 --> 00:25:30,800
Rym: Birds, bugs, cats, dogs.

490
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:34,300
Rym: As I got older and hit puberty, my fascination turned to an obsession.

491
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:37,720
Rym: I started hanging out in graveyards looking for like-minded individuals.

492
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,500
Rym: At one point I had a relationship with a corpse, but she never wanted to go out and do anything.

493
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,379
Rym: Then I heard about Potter's Field and realized my life could never be complete if I didn't visit

494
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:45,460
Rym: it.".

495
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:48,247
Rym: Uh, yeah.

496
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:49,470
Rym: "Was there doing?

497
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,600
Rym: disinterment and the stink of human decomposing bodies is really something awful.

498
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,178
Rym: This place is littered with human bones dating

499
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:56,480
Rym: centuries.".

500
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,740
Rym: One hell of an experience.

501
00:25:59,021 --> 00:26:00,673
Scott: "Dead bodies

502
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:01,580
Scott: galore.".

503
00:26:04,382 --> 00:26:08,680
Rym: So I was curious at this point because it could have been a joke.

504
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:14,180
Rym: You know, people will sort of bomb reviews on Yelp and just kind of make an issue.

505
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:18,720
Rym: So I looked up and I'm going to link to the Wikipedia article on Heart Island.

506
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,540
Rym: Heart Island is New York City's Potter's Field.

507
00:26:22,262 --> 00:26:24,279
Rym: It was bought from the Indians a long time ago.

508
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,586
Rym: The city bought it from the guy... Yeah, who bought it from the Indians.

509
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:32,441
Rym: Some guy in the Bronx for $75,000.

510
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:38,020
Rym: We put civil war prisoners of war on this island and it is New York City's Potter's Field.

511
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:47,672
Rym: A Potter's Field is where a city buries people if they don't know who they are, if they die and no one claims the body, if it's a baby.

512
00:26:47,692 --> 00:26:55,040
Rym: in the times before they buried babies anywhere, it's also where they put limbs that are cut off of people, bones they find.

513
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,220
Rym: Basically, they just dumped bodies on this island for centuries and they still do it to this day.

514
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:09,918
Rym: So if you go to this island, and there's also crazy drama about this island, the press are not allowed to go to the island at all.

515
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,714
Rym: There have been all these lawsuits...

516
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:14,400
Scott: You will get arrested.

517
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,158
Scott: Will they shoot you?

518
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:16,584
Rym: No, they will arrest you.

519
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:20,460
Rym: People have filed freedom of information requests to find out who's buried there.

520
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,045
Rym: The city stonewalls.

521
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:31,200
Rym: There are a bunch of lawsuits where the city is obligated to let people visit the island if they can prove that they have a direct relative who is buried on the island.

522
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,600
Rym: That's difficult because a lot of the records were burned and a lot of the records are difficult to find.

523
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:42,759
Rym: But even if you prove that, they'll take you to the island, you can stand on a gazebo, you're not allowed to leave the gazebo or see any gravesite.

524
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:48,200
Rym: And they have prisoners who do the disinterment and such.

525
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:50,360
Scott: From Riker's Island, which is very close by.

526
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:59,480
Rym: I'm pretty sure that this island is just littered in piles and piles and piles of poorly kept human remains.

527
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,080
Rym: And it's a secret and the city is trying to hide malfeasance and there's crazy drama and stories about this place.

528
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,500
Scott: You can look at it with a satellite, it looks like trees.

529
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,000
Rym: Yeah, zoom all the way in and you see weird, abandoned, busted buildings and white stuff everywhere.

530
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:16,280
Rym: I think there's cool, creepy stuff and I really want to go to this island now.

531
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,720
Scott: So, right near freaking Heart Island, you may know about Little Brother Island.

532
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,900
Rym: Little Brother Island.

533
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,480
Rym: I don't know about Little Brother Island.

534
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,373
Scott: You don't know about, well it's North Brother Island actually.

535
00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:29,720
Scott: I was trying to be funny with Little Brother.

536
00:28:30,162 --> 00:28:31,320
Rym: You can make it, Little Brother.

537
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:36,259
Scott: In 1885, they built a hospital there and you know what the hospital was for?

538
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,939
Rym: Tuberculosis or insane people.

539
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:40,457
Scott: Quarantining of?

540
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,847
Rym: Oh, oh, oh.

541
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:43,500
Rym: It's going to be typhoid, right?

542
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,383
Scott: Typhoid and?

543
00:28:44,383 --> 00:28:44,423
Scott: 1885.

544
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,912
Scott: Doesn't exist anymore.

545
00:28:48,664 --> 00:28:49,158
Rym: One of the flus?

546
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,142
Rym: Smallpox.

547
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:54,778
Scott: In the 50s, they turned it into a rehab center and they abandoned it in '63.

548
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,960
Scott: And now, urban explorer people go there and take pictures and there's like a pile of books and some buildings and some toilets.

549
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:03,259
Rym: Hopefully they don't find smallpox.

550
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,243
Scott: Yep.

551
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:11,640
Scott: Because when it was a rehab center, you can still see stuff left over from the heroin addicts that were living there.

552
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:18,420
Scott: You know, it still remains there of stuff, but it's not like some island you're going to get shot or arrested if you try to go to.

553
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,629
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

554
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:22,538
Rym: I really want to go to Potter's Island, but I can't.

555
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,788
Scott: It's Heart Island.

556
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:24,860
Scott: Potter's Field.

557
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,680
Rym: Potter's Field on Heart Island.

558
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,740
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

559
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,628
Rym: You got a thing of the day?

560
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:33,292
Scott: So, there was an awesome person once.

561
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:34,899
Scott: Do you know what that person's name was?

562
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:41,960
Rym: I was going to say the guy who wrote The Little Prince or maybe Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

563
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,770
Scott: No, a person that I don't know if you've mentioned on this show before.

564
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,316
Scott: Anton LaVey.

565
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:47,140
Scott: Pretty awesome guy.

566
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,039
Rym: Pretty awesome guy.

567
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:52,940
Scott: So, did you know that he was awesome at playing what instrument?

568
00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:55,428
Rym: Now I got to guess.

569
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:56,940
Rym: I'm going to go with something crazy.

570
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,100
Scott: It's crazy, alright.

571
00:29:58,544 --> 00:30:00,460
Rym: Alright, the sack butt.

572
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:02,406
Scott: No, the calliope.

573
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:06,240
Scott: As in the thing that's inside the carousel at the amusement park.

574
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:15,680
Scott: So, here's a video with him playing and talking all about playing awesome, carny instruments.

575
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,948
Rym: That is pretty badass.

576
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:18,299
Rym: I want one of those now.

577
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,975
Scott: Yeah, well he's playing on an electronic keyboard in the 80s, I think.

578
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:22,196
Scott: Oh, '93.

579
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,500
Scott: But he had played all those kinds of crazy instruments in earlier days.

580
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:41,500
Rym: A school that I visited when I was in high school with my marching band to do a thing actually had basically an old calliope like the same kind of instrument just in the music room.

581
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:43,957
Rym: So, we just started playing with it.

582
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:45,626
Rym: Okay.

583
00:30:45,868 --> 00:30:46,151
Rym: That's all.

584
00:30:46,171 --> 00:30:47,080
Rym: There's nothing else.

585
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,540
Scott: Basically people couldn't afford an organ.

586
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,201
Rym: Yeah.

587
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:51,879
Scott: And I don't think Hammond organs existed yet, right?

588
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:54,259
Rym: Back then, no.

589
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,200
Scott: It was just pipe organs.

590
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:55,540
Scott: Yes.

591
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,120
Scott: Yeah, when did the Hammond organ get invented?

592
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,873
Rym: I would guess the 60s.

593
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,457
Scott: Yeah, let me check that.

594
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,002
Rym: That is my guess.

595
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:03,825
Rym: I might be really wrong.

596
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:12,120
Rym: That's the kind of guess I would make at a trivia night at a bar or perhaps on ATK9K, the trivia podcast.

597
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:12,723
Scott: I don't know.

598
00:31:12,864 --> 00:31:14,717
Scott: The people played Hammond organs in the 30s and the 40s.

599
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:15,558
Scott: Alright.

600
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,952
Scott: But I don't think it was the electric kind.

601
00:31:18,113 --> 00:31:18,697
Scott: Oh, maybe it was.

602
00:31:18,717 --> 00:31:19,240
Scott: They had electricity.

603
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,085
Rym: Okay.

604
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:20,290
Rym: Alright.

605
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:21,182
Scott: I don't know.

606
00:31:21,283 --> 00:31:22,247
Scott: I didn't read enough of the article.

607
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:25,060
Scott: I just looked for the first year in the history section on Wikipedia.

608
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,620
Rym: So, Scott, I move that we suspend Robert's rules of order for the remainder of the show.

609
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:38,420
Scott: I move that we skip the metamoment, except for the fact that ConnectiCon and Paxos are really fucking close.

610
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:38,681
Rym: Alright.

611
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:40,433
Rym: I do not second your movement.

612
00:31:40,493 --> 00:31:41,520
Rym: So, what?

613
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:43,345
Scott: So, we're going to do metamoment.

614
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:45,113
Scott: Go to ConnectiCon and Paxos.

615
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:45,736
Scott: Oh, my God.

616
00:31:45,756 --> 00:31:46,760
Scott: They're like freaking tomorrow.

617
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,422
Rym: Oh, my God.

618
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:47,743
Rym: I know.

619
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:52,800
Rym: I got to get my shit together for ConnectiCon and Paxos and the submissions for Paxdev.

620
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,265
Rym: A lot of people haven't gotten back with me.

621
00:31:55,747 --> 00:32:00,640
Rym: You who might or might not be listening to this, you need to get back to me in the next two or three days.

622
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,167
Rym: You're not going to be on that panel.

623
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:04,839
Rym: And if none of you get back to me, there won't be a panel.

624
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,129
Rym: But, yeah, ConnectiCon is going to be awesome.

625
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:09,760
Rym: Paxos is going to be awesome.

626
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:13,246
Rym: And I got to pick a book club book.

627
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:17,380
Rym: I've got a book I might pick, but I'm going to read a chapter of it first to be sure.

628
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:25,260
Rym: The only reason I'm deciding to maybe pick it is because Emily picked it up and started reading it on this trip and basically burned through the whole thing.

629
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:29,080
Rym: So, either it's really good or she has to write a paper on it or something.

630
00:32:30,421 --> 00:32:31,463
Scott: This Saturday.

631
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:32,265
Scott: Right.

632
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:33,849
Scott: Hold on.

633
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:34,832
Scott: I got to get the time.

634
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:38,060
Scott: I think it's pretty early in the morning.

635
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:41,951
Scott: This Saturday at 10 a.m.

636
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:44,420
Scott: is bar camp again in New York City.

637
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:51,540
Scott: I did not help it out this year because I've been busy with Paxos preparing this instead of, you know, bar camp.

638
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,960
Rym: We still haven't figured out our itinerary for shit.

639
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
Scott: We don't really need one that much.

640
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,284
Rym: We do.

641
00:32:56,324 --> 00:33:00,660
Rym: We need to arrange our transport and things ahead of time so that we don't waste time doing that shit that later.

642
00:33:00,901 --> 00:33:01,223
Scott: I guess.

643
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:02,089
Rym: Like go-karts?

644
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:03,580
Rym: If we don't have that shit prearranged, I'm not doing it.

645
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,092
Scott: Well, someone else is arranging the go-kart.

646
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:06,020
Rym: Are they arranging it?

647
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:08,448
Scott: I'm not doing it because we need a lot of people.

648
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:11,340
Scott: So if they don't just get to me and say this is the go-kart we're doing, I'm not doing it.

649
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,186
Scott: Well, then it's not going to happen.

650
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:12,710
Scott: Exactly.

651
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,354
Scott: So it's up to them.

652
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:14,100
Scott: That's not up to me.

653
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,066
Rym: Then it's not going to happen.

654
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:16,032
Rym: We're not doing no go-karts.

655
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,120
Scott: Anyway, then what are we doing?

656
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,144
Scott: We're doing plenty.

657
00:33:18,224 --> 00:33:18,727
Scott: OK, so.

658
00:33:19,451 --> 00:33:21,180
Scott: But, yeah, bar camp is tomorrow.

659
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:28,600
Scott: So if you want to go to it, you have to go to the website and register so that you can get into the frickin building with their stupid, you know, office New York security bullshit.

660
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:29,081
Rym: Yeah.

661
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:29,322
Scott: Right.

662
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:30,867
Scott: And then it's just free.

663
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:34,639
Scott: So, you know, if you want to go register on the website and then show up.

664
00:33:35,521 --> 00:33:37,465
Rym: There's also the big pride parade stuff.

665
00:33:37,846 --> 00:33:38,026
Scott: Yep.

666
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:39,088
Rym: This weekend.

667
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:44,059
Rym: Some people are coming into town and probably I'll probably hit at least one of the pride events.

668
00:33:45,183 --> 00:33:45,405
Rym: Maybe.

669
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:46,759
Rym: I haven't decided which one yet.

670
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:48,744
Rym: Oh, what else is going on?

671
00:33:48,804 --> 00:33:52,135
Rym: Cat Empire, I think, is doing a concert this weekend.

672
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,480
Rym: I didn't buy tickets yet.

673
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,971
Scott: A little tangential.

674
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:55,959
Scott: How about a book club book?

675
00:33:57,141 --> 00:33:59,028
Rym: I could pick it, but I don't have one right now.

676
00:33:59,048 --> 00:34:00,794
Rym: I could I could announce it right now.

677
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:02,380
Rym: But like I said, I haven't read any of it yet.

678
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,526
Rym: Do you want me to just pick it?

679
00:34:04,747 --> 00:34:07,760
Scott: People need to know a book to buy and start reading because they read way slower than us.

680
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,520
Scott: If you can, if you're going to keep with the same book and not change your mind, then pick one.

681
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,022
Rym: All right, fine.

682
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:12,422
Rym: You know what?

683
00:34:12,623 --> 00:34:12,946
Rym: Fuck it.

684
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:14,934
Rym: The book club book is a book.

685
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:16,500
Rym: Now I have to pull it up on Amazon.

686
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,149
Scott: It better not be the book.

687
00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:19,279
Scott: I hope it's not.

688
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:20,619
Rym: I still want to do that book.

689
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,043
Scott: Oh, good.

690
00:34:21,063 --> 00:34:21,879
Scott: You're not doing that one.

691
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,120
Rym: I really want to do that book, though, because I think that book is going to be a really good book.

692
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,639
Scott: Well, once you say something, you can't unsay it.

693
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,978
Rym: Why don't we just read that book and then review it?

694
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:31,614
Scott: Sounds OK.

695
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,120
Rym: So this book is called Stasi Land, stories from beyond the Berlin Wall.

696
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:44,560
Rym: And the deal is a reporter went and interviewed all these people who lived through, you know, East Germany, West Germany, Berlin Wall, the Stasi.

697
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:57,580
Rym: And it's basically a collection of stories of what it was actually like to live in a place like that, which, you know, a place where neighbors are spying on neighbors and the government is collecting ridiculous information intruding in people's lives.

698
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,179
Scott: Sounds like what we're living in now.

699
00:34:59,320 --> 00:34:59,601
Scott: Yeah.

700
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:07,360
Rym: I feel like all these people who seem not too concerned with what the NSA might be up to could probably stand to read this book.

701
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,639
Rym: I also suspect that none of you have read this book.

702
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:13,979
Scott: I didn't even know it existed till just now.

703
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:17,175
Rym: And I kind of want to read it because Emily burned through it so fast.

704
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:18,180
Rym: So I will link to it.

705
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:19,920
Rym: The book club book is Stasi Land.

706
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,148
Rym: It's nonfiction.

707
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,920
Scott: Get ready for a slog.

708
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,140
Rym: But it's a collection of narrative short story.

709
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,438
Rym: That makes it a little more palatable.

710
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:34,320
Rym: Remember, if you ever cross me, you're going to read that fucking Norwich Byzantine book that I still have not finished.

711
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,000
Rym: That thing is 500 dry as pages of Byzantine rulers doing their business.

712
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,450
Scott: Listen, I have counter, you know how many books have been written in the history of humanity?

713
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:45,420
Scott: I can counter attack with the ultimate counter attacks of doom.

714
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,613
Rym: Ulysses?

715
00:35:47,242 --> 00:35:49,200
Scott: That's only the most obvious of the counter attacks.

716
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:54,320
Rym: You realize counter attacking, you cannot counter attack me because we both have to read the book.

717
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,619
Rym: You're going to set yourself on fire just to bring me down with you.

718
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,238
Rym: That's right.

719
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:01,711
Rym: I can't think of many books that are poison to you.

720
00:36:02,374 --> 00:36:03,880
Rym: Poison to me, but not to you.

721
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,299
Rym: But I can think of many books that are poison to you, but not to me.

722
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,844
Scott: You are thinking wrong.

723
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:09,129
Scott: You are thinking wrong.

724
00:36:09,189 --> 00:36:12,020
Scott: I know many, many choices that would be very poisonous.

725
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:13,427
Rym: I don't know.

726
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:14,740
Rym: I think you'd have trouble with Norwich.

727
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,840
Scott: World Atlas 1986.

728
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,506
Rym: You're going to enjoy that book?

729
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:20,534
Rym: You're going to enjoy reading the dictionary?

730
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,220
Rym: Scrabble dictionary?

731
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:23,900
Scott: Oxford English Dictionary.

732
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,168
Rym: Spoilers, spoilers.

733
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:27,800
Rym: I'm going to steal a joke from Stephen Wright.

734
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,797
Scott: World Book Encyclopedia volume Q.

735
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,270
Rym: I'm about to steal a joke from Stephen Wright.

736
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,073
Rym: I think he told this in 1988?

737
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:34,414
Rym: Maybe earlier.

738
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:38,780
Rym: So, I'm the dictionary.

739
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:40,754
Rym: It turns out the zebra did it.

740
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,520
Rym: So, Robert's Rules of Order.

741
00:36:46,840 --> 00:37:00,780
Rym: Everyone who goes to college and joins the club probably learns what Robert's Rules of Order are, because you're going to go to some club meeting, especially if you go to a real school like a university, or a school that has formal clubs that actually have governance in the school.

742
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:11,960
Rym: You're going to go to your first meeting if you get involved in that stuff, and you're going to see a bunch of guys sitting around and one of them is going to say, "I move that we suspend Robert's Rules of Order for the remainder of this meeting.

743
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,092
Rym: I'm going to say yes, and then they'll have their

744
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,354
Rym: meeting.".

745
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:22,880
Rym: Robert's Rules of Order, if you don't know, are the pretty much definitive way to run parliamentary systems.

746
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:31,880
Rym: if you have to have a group of people who disagree and might be stupid come to some sort of agreement on something and avoid drama.

747
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:53,637
Scott: Yet, mostly these systems are really useful in a situation where there are a few smart, no-drama people to administer the system, and most of the people are drama-crazy or stupid or who knows what, and if you just let people talk and do whatever, it'll just be people shouting over each other for hours non-stop, and you'll never get anything done, right?

748
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,830
Scott: So it's how can you keep those people there?

749
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:11,460
Scott: because it's wrong to kick them out and have them not be heard, and actually have a discussion and make decisions, right, together, while most people are fucking just trying to ruin the thing all the time.

750
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,766
Rym: No, these were published in 1876.

751
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:14,194
Rym: They've been around a while.

752
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,655
Scott: This problem of stupid people making it impossible to come to group decisions is old.

753
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:21,020
Scott: It is an old problem.

754
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:26,659
Rym: But you know how you watch 1776, for example, and they keep like, "I move to do

755
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:26,880
Rym: this.".

756
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,185
Rym: "Well, I move that you're an ass,".

757
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:30,294
Rym: and that's the same thing.

758
00:38:30,335 --> 00:38:31,580
Rym: It's parliamentary procedure.

759
00:38:31,982 --> 00:38:34,353
Rym: Anytime someone says, "I second your motion,".

760
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:49,224
Rym: that's all Robert's Rules of Order, it behooves you to understand the basics of Robert's Rules of Order, because even if you never use them formally, knowing them will allow you to navigate these kinds of waters, if you ever find yourself in them.

761
00:38:49,927 --> 00:39:01,520
Rym: It allows you to rules-lawyer stupid people into doing what you want, and it just gives you a sort of idea of how you can get people to behave if you need some way to make them behave.

762
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:03,719
Rym: But don't have any direct authority over that.

763
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:34,780
Rym: So, yeah, Robert's Rules of Order, really, the main use of these, in my opinion, is not so much to get decisions to be made, but really, it's that it allows people to get decisions that are made where the people who lose, like we try to do X, we end up doing Y, the people who lose have to shut up, but more importantly, the people who lose don't necessarily take it personally because the system as a whole did it as opposed to one individual.

764
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,960
Rym: Remember in 1776, the guy at the front of the room presided over everything?

765
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:47,134
Rym: He was totally neutral, he had to be, and he was just like, "The representative from Rhode Island has moved to do X!

766
00:39:47,295 --> 00:39:47,616
Rym: Do you

767
00:39:47,817 --> 00:39:47,918
Rym: all!".

768
00:39:50,461 --> 00:40:06,120
Rym: One person will take all the ire, but at the same time, that person is very unpersonable and impassive and impersonal, and as a result, you can diffuse the drama that would occur when people don't get their way because the system did it, no individual person did it.

769
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,180
Rym: That is the greatest contribution Robert's Rules of Order will bring.

770
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,100
Scott: I think the contribution, I mean, we really said the same thing, right?

771
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:27,069
Scott: It's like, the contribution is, you can get this shit done with these crazy people, and that's the method, that is how, you know, the number one way how it diffuses all those crazy people and prevents them from shouting match, because it's like, yeah, what are you going to shout at?

772
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:28,976
Scott: We did it, it's done, what are you going to say now?

773
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:29,699
Scott: There's nothing to say.

774
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,160
Rym: So Scott, have you ever actually fully followed Robert's Rules of Order?

775
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:42,240
Scott: I've not fully followed them, but when we were in the youth groups of high school, we partially followed them and we did not dismiss them immediately.

776
00:40:43,420 --> 00:41:12,620
Scott: Basically, right, people, you know, we'd have a meeting, someone would make, you know, announcements, and then it would be, we would like, you know, be like, alright, you know, so and so wants to do something, you needed a second, and then they'd be like, alright, now we vote, and we'd just vote with hands, or we'd vote with yay and nay, and, you know, it wasn't, you know, by the book Robert's Rules of Order, but we kept them on pretty much the whole time, but it was more of a, it was less to shut down crazy people, right, because we didn't need the order, we could have just, you know, discussed things out and had it done properly.

777
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:22,480
Scott: It was more of a, this is a fun, ceremonial, ritualistic method of conducting meetings, and it was just sort of fun to do, you know, traditional kind of, you know, way.

778
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:28,758
Rym: There was R-WAG, there were tales from before we got to RIT where R-WAG, you know, there was the gaming

779
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:29,280
Scott: club on campus,

780
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:48,383
Rym: their constitution basically said something like, you know, all executive board meetings are provided over by Robert's Rules of Order, blah blah blah, and basically, they would do a technicality where they would say that Robert's Rules of Order are required, but not provide them, so you had to actually own the book and bring it, and cite it, It's

781
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:49,039
Scott: not a cheap book.

782
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:54,660
Rym: If you wanted to, and you had to bring the current book too, I don't think it's public domain.

783
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,059
Rym: Well, they keep publishing new versions that technically supersede the old ones in order to sort of make sure you have to keep buying it.

784
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:03,200
Scott: Who prints the thing, anyway?

785
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:03,984
Rym: I don't know.

786
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:07,760
Rym: All I know is I thought, I'm going to link to, Or is Robert like Webster with his dictionary?

787
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,225
Rym: There's a real Robert, but ULM actually has a post, and this is the greatest thing, it's this old PDF.

788
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:26,380
Rym: I found, I've referenced this several times in my life, this thing explains all the basic motions and the basic way that it works, and has a cheat sheet that looks a lot like the Burning Wheel Duel of Witch sheet.

789
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:31,340
Rym: If you want to adjourn the meeting, you say this, I move that we adjourn.

790
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,636
Rym: May you interrupt the speaker?

791
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:32,860
Rym: No.

792
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,775
Rym: Must you be seconded?

793
00:42:33,836 --> 00:42:34,000
Rym: Yes.

794
00:42:34,122 --> 00:42:34,935
Rym: Is the motion debatable?

795
00:42:34,956 --> 00:42:34,996
Rym: No.

796
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,593
Rym: What vote is required?

797
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,080
Rym: Majority.

798
00:42:37,901 --> 00:42:39,172
Rym: So you just look at this like, what do I want to do?

799
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:40,080
Rym: I want to amend a motion.

800
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,739
Rym: You find the row, you go down, you figure out if you can interrupt, and then you do it.

801
00:42:45,884 --> 00:42:47,699
Scott: What are the things you can do that allow interrupting?

802
00:42:48,362 --> 00:42:57,380
Rym: Oh, so you can interrupt the speaker to a point of privilege, so complaining about something, like something meta, like the room's too hot, I'm tired.

803
00:42:57,941 --> 00:42:58,706
Scott: Okay.

804
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:03,980
Rym: There's no vote, it doesn't mean anything, you just, point of privilege, I'm bored.

805
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:06,295
Scott: Nice.

806
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:11,720
Rym: I guess I could cite you for, you know, if you use that in an insulting manner.

807
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,120
Scott: Point of privilege, the air conditioner is not on, I'm melting in here.

808
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:19,080
Rym: You can object to procedure or personal affront as a point of order.

809
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,639
Scott: As you take personal affront, just boring shit.

810
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,240
Scott: I take that as personal affront, good sir.

811
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:33,340
Rym: Yeah, the problem is, you can interrupt the speaker, but there's no vote, the chair just handles your affront however he or she wishes.

812
00:43:34,342 --> 00:43:35,080
Scott: I'll keep affronting.

813
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:41,994
Rym: You can call for a point of information, where you, you know, I would like to know the rule of Robert's rule of order in this case, because I don't know it.

814
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:46,400
Rym: You can object to the consideration of an undiplomatic vote.

815
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,737
Scott: What was an undiplomatic vote?

816
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,420
Scott: Let's not go down that rabbit hole.

817
00:43:53,486 --> 00:43:54,700
Rym: I could explain it, but I'm not going to.

818
00:43:55,503 --> 00:43:57,879
Rym: You can reconsider something that was already disposed of.

819
00:43:58,624 --> 00:43:59,539
Rym: You can interrupt for that.

820
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,160
Rym: You can vote on a ruling by the chair.

821
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,860
Rym: So if the chair, if I make a point of privilege, I'm bored.

822
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:15,400
Rym: You make a point of order, you're offended and take personal affront at my boredom, and the chair says, yes, Rym, fuck you, you don't get to talk anymore.

823
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:21,399
Rym: And then someone else votes to appeal the chair's decision to tell me not to talk, and then we vote.

824
00:44:22,102 --> 00:44:24,100
Rym: All of those things can be interruptions along the way.

825
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:26,280
Rym: There's more, I'm not going to go down this one.

826
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,920
Scott: I mean, there are rules of order, right?

827
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,580
Scott: It's ways of maintaining order when there are a bunch of opposed people.

828
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:34,880
Rym: It doesn't get you justice, but it gets you quiet.

829
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,079
Scott: That is what Robert's rules of order do.

830
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:49,580
Scott: Right, and as long as there is some enforcement of the rules, right, where basically if anyone starts, you know, talking, who's not supposed to be talking or says something they're not supposed to say, the chair just fricking bangs the gavel and says, shut the fuck up.

831
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,467
Scott: Shut the fuck up.

832
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:51,779
Scott: You're not allowed to talk right now.

833
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,040
Scott: Order, order, order.

834
00:44:53,302 --> 00:44:55,720
Scott: And then maybe a bailiff takes you out or something, right?

835
00:44:56,061 --> 00:45:07,980
Scott: So you can all have a ton of people who are really passionate or crazed or really incensed and have a lot to say, but unlike at panels at cons where they'll just yell out, you can't just yell out.

836
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,160
Scott: You got to maintain order in this hereto proceedings.

837
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:22,240
Rym: Now in the RIT Anime Club, I think I forget, but I think our constitution basically said we use Robert's rules of order, but it was implied that we always went to, I think the term is informal discussion or whatever.

838
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:46,400
Rym: Basically, and this is kind of my advice to you kids out there, because a lot of you are in high school or in college, and if you're joining clubs and getting into all this business, like high school youth group or whatever, and you're in a position to decide how your procedures work, I would recommend that regardless of what your stupid constitution says, your board should meet in private, if you can, and just talk and try to always rule by consensus.

839
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:53,260
Rym: Talk until you have a unanimous agreement and only ever call a vote if you are sure that the vote will be unanimous.

840
00:45:53,641 --> 00:46:00,060
Scott: If you're in a situation where you need to use Robert's rules of order because there's drama crazy people, you're already in trouble because you have drama crazy people.

841
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,780
Rym: So what you do is you go until unanimous.

842
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,159
Rym: What are we going to show four weeks from now?

843
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,700
Rym: And we just talk about it until we all agree.

844
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,079
Rym: Now, maybe I didn't want to show fancy la-la, but everyone else does.

845
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,339
Rym: I might say, you know what, fine, I'll go with it.

846
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,759
Rym: I will vote yes when we vote.

847
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:21,160
Rym: I don't object strongly enough to make this an issue.

848
00:46:21,742 --> 00:46:23,680
Rym: I just want to go get some food because it's Friday.

849
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,719
Rym: It's like 5.30 and we've been here for an hour.

850
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,800
Rym: But at the same time, we would switch to Robert's rules of order.

851
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:44,340
Rym: if it was obvious, like if we'd been debating for a couple hours and it was obvious no consensus would be made, we would either just call a vote or formal Robert's rules of order.

852
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:49,619
Rym: Calling a vote is basically calling the question in Robert's rules of order of fuck it, let's just vote.

853
00:46:50,302 --> 00:46:52,540
Rym: And you need to vote on if you're going to have the vote.

854
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,739
Rym: and if you have the vote, then you vote.

855
00:46:56,561 --> 00:47:04,500
Rym: So the only other time you need to use Robert's rules of order, and this is when you use it from the beginning, is if there is prearranged drama.

856
00:47:05,443 --> 00:47:09,340
Scott: Like you're going into a meeting already knowing, drama is coming down.

857
00:47:10,082 --> 00:47:19,980
Rym: All right, all us smart people got together separately for the mutiny and we're like, we are going to strip the president of our club of his powers because he's a drama filled jackass.

858
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:25,140
Rym: We are going to do it and then you show up at the meeting and he's ready to do his normal bullshit.

859
00:47:25,644 --> 00:47:28,686
Rym: and then you all look at each other and someone says, I move that.

860
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:30,380
Rym: we begin with Robert's rules of order.

861
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:31,600
Rym: I second, it approved.

862
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:32,882
Rym: I move that.

863
00:47:32,903 --> 00:47:36,920
Rym: we remove Chairman Joey Jojo Shabadoo from the chair.

864
00:47:37,443 --> 00:47:37,925
Rym: I move that.

865
00:47:37,945 --> 00:47:42,520
Rym: we're that and you go through the full formal procedure from the beginning.

866
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:46,380
Rym: That way the drama person has no point where they can say anything.

867
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:47,595
Rym: They can't really...

868
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,139
Scott: They could interrupt what they're affronted.

869
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:55,360
Rym: They can follow all the rules, but they can't just speak their kind of drama piece.

870
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:57,659
Rym: They get their chance to speak per the rules.

871
00:47:58,582 --> 00:48:03,660
Rym: and the thing is, usually when you're doing this, it's because you're getting rid of someone full of drama.

872
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,640
Rym: They're pretty much immediately going to start yelling or crying or causing a scene.

873
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,000
Scott: Well, it's rules of order, it's not rules of making a scene.

874
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,619
Scott: so you're going to be in big trouble if you freak out.

875
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:18,459
Rym: So Robert's rules of order basically let you immediately win as soon as the person freaks out.

876
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:31,060
Scott: Exactly, that's really the fundamental thing here is that as rules of order, not only do they help you maintain order but really what they do is shut down anyone who goes out of order.

877
00:48:31,922 --> 00:48:41,759
Scott: And a lot of times when you have any emotional situations in group meetings that have some sort of power of decision making even over trivial matters like on an animated show...

878
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,540
Rym: I was in multiple eboard meetings where more than one person cried during the debate.

879
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:50,220
Scott: Yeah, and it's like really, it's just anime club and you're freaking out.

880
00:48:50,781 --> 00:48:55,279
Scott: But if people are freaking out, it basically makes it so the people who are freaking out lose.

881
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,220
Scott: That's what they're on, right?

882
00:48:57,661 --> 00:49:03,299
Scott: So the people who are calm and collected, intelligent, not freaking out people, win out.

883
00:49:03,764 --> 00:49:05,220
Scott: And I think that's a pretty good system.

884
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,694
Scott: I think you should be able to, you know...

885
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:13,440
Rym: Now in most cases, very few people will use Robert's rule on their own where there's no meta authority.

886
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:22,820
Rym: Like I found a local anime club, like just for me, I probably, you know, unless you watched our lecture on how to run an anime club, you probably don't think to write a constitution to have Robert's rules of order.

887
00:49:23,242 --> 00:49:26,820
Rym: But in that case, the rules are the full authority.

888
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:36,359
Rym: So there's the sort of Andrew Jackson option of the chair has made its decision, fuck the chair, get out of my basement all of you, the club is done.

889
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:37,015
Scott: That's right.

890
00:49:39,024 --> 00:49:41,839
Rym: And in that case, what I'm about to recommend doesn't really work.

891
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:57,730
Rym: But in the case of you're in a body where you could get sued, you're in a body where there's a meta authority, like you meet at the library, you're the city council, you are the university club, and there's the club board that

892
00:49:58,011 --> 00:49:58,594
Scott: reviews

893
00:49:58,634 --> 00:50:03,660
Rym: the bullshit you do, where if you kick someone out of your club, they can cause drama for you.

894
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,620
Rym: They can cause injury from outside.

895
00:50:06,082 --> 00:50:11,220
Rym: So you need to start formally and do everything we just said, not just so the drama person will lose.

896
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:11,979
Rym: They're going to lose anyway.

897
00:50:12,722 --> 00:50:16,960
Rym: So that you have a very formal record of how it all went down.

898
00:50:17,362 --> 00:50:27,080
Rym: So when that person tries to appeal to the ombudsman, the ombudsman comes and your secretary gives them the role of what happened fully following Robert's Rules of Order.

899
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:28,638
Rym: You've basically covered your ass.

900
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,440
Rym: Robert's Rules of Order is a combination of stop drama, cover one's asses.

901
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,021
Scott: Right.

902
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:37,149
Scott: And you know, the covering ass is like, you know, it's twofold.

903
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:41,419
Scott: It's number one, we followed these rules and that's how it turned out.

904
00:50:42,344 --> 00:50:43,420
Scott: What can you complain about?

905
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,660
Scott: It was neutral and fair according to these rules.

906
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,119
Scott: We played the game and I won.

907
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,418
Scott: That's how it is.

908
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,358
Scott: It's a very biased thing where everyone is out to get you.

909
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,660
Scott: And at the same time, it's also like, look, these rules benefit the not freaking out person.

910
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:58,440
Scott: You were the freaking out person.

911
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,529
Scott: That's why you lost.

912
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:04,040
Scott: Hey, look, third parties, the not freaking out people won out in this decision.

913
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:05,419
Scott: That's why it's the right decision.

914
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,520
Rym: Also, it's a lot like a burning wheel duel of wits suddenly.

915
00:51:11,005 --> 00:51:11,738
Scott: Oh, it sure is.

916
00:51:12,062 --> 00:51:13,418
Rym: And like you said, that's kind of fun.

917
00:51:15,464 --> 00:51:20,163
Rym: Now my sort of meta point about bringing this up is one, like I said, a lot of you listeners will probably be able to use this.

918
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,280
Rym: It's learn this stuff just enough.

919
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,100
Rym: Read this document for real.

920
00:51:24,462 --> 00:51:27,660
Rym: If there's drama, print it out and show it to the other non drama people.

921
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:35,040
Scott: It's weird that it seems sort of like an adult thing, but actually I used it way more when I was younger and hardly, pretty much zero, not at all since leaving college.

922
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,020
Rym: And you might feel awkward going through the motions.

923
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,747
Rym: You might feel awkward like actually following the procedure.

924
00:51:41,252 --> 00:51:41,960
Rym: Just go with it.

925
00:51:42,241 --> 00:51:46,000
Rym: Just like actually try to take it seriously and just do it.

926
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,780
Rym: Just be like, I move to whatever.

927
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:50,259
Rym: I move to the fuck Scott in the ass.

928
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,014
Scott: Whoa.

929
00:51:51,262 --> 00:51:51,937
Scott: I second that motion.

930
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,760
Scott: You can't second your own motion.

931
00:51:54,684 --> 00:51:56,040
Scott: And I take that as an affront.

932
00:52:00,223 --> 00:52:10,138
Rym: At the same time, if you're going to go through the motions fully and formally and all this, if you need practice because you don't feel like you can kind of keep it going and you'll feel awkward, just play mafia.

933
00:52:10,983 --> 00:52:13,000
Rym: That's how the voting to kill someone works in mafia.

934
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,539
Rym: You point and someone seconds, then you have a debate and then you vote.

935
00:52:17,381 --> 00:52:19,960
Rym: Mafia is just a tiny version of Robert's Rules of Order.

936
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:27,599
Rym: In fact, I wonder how interesting mafia would be if you instituted a slightly more formal version of Robert's Rules of Order.

937
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,799
Scott: No, I mean, because basically mafia, you're simulating the town council meeting the next day of who to kill.

938
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,560
Scott: So of course that meeting has Robert's Rules of Order or something similar to it, right?

939
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:37,900
Scott: It makes perfect sense.

940
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,939
Scott: Thematically, you know, you're role playing that meeting in the morning, right?

941
00:52:44,003 --> 00:52:46,438
Scott: And it also works as a game mechanic because it is a game.

942
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:51,600
Rym: But my meta point, and I got to do this earlier, is that certainly it bothers me about the US government.

943
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,578
Rym: We have parliamentary procedures in...

944
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,420
Scott: They're not exactly Robert's Rules of Order, though.

945
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,340
Scott: Each different body makes its own crazy rules that are always crazy different and changing and whatnot.

946
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,360
Rym: They're well beyond what the Constitution stipulates.

947
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,200
Scott: The Congress actually has a rules committee.

948
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:10,017
Scott: Both houses of Congress have rules committees that make up the rules for the friggin... It's crazy.

949
00:53:10,403 --> 00:53:11,099
Rym: I'm fine with that.

950
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,639
Rym: What bothers me is that people break the rules.

951
00:53:16,602 --> 00:53:17,200
Rym: I don't care.

952
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:26,194
Rym: The fact that the Congress can't just vote against the rules and then follow them a hundred percent, that they will break their own goddamn rules, the Republicans will start chanting, "USA!

953
00:53:26,657 --> 00:53:27,180
Rym: USA!"

954
00:53:27,462 --> 00:53:36,260
Rym: so that the chairman can actually pretend he didn't hear the point of order that was made because they'd broken the rules and had an illegal vote and that that shit counts.

955
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,400
Rym: That's what bothers me about our government.

956
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,871
Scott: Robert's Rules of Order are made by this dude, Robert, who I don't think exists.

957
00:53:43,911 --> 00:53:44,539
Scott: I think he's like Webster.

958
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,240
Scott: But you pretend the fictional Robert made up these rules.

959
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,920
Scott: Maybe there was a Robert at some point.

960
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,640
Rym: Robert, read the Wikipedia.

961
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,159
Scott: He can't still be alive.

962
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:52,099
Rym: God, no!

963
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,740
Scott: Right, so there was a guy named Robert.

964
00:53:54,220 --> 00:54:00,420
Scott: He didn't have, you know, Robert doesn't have an opinion on what anime is being shown this week, right?

965
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,000
Scott: He's got no stake in that game.

966
00:54:02,441 --> 00:54:06,400
Scott: He's pretty much, the only thing Robert really cares about is will Robert come back to life?

967
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,158
Scott: The answer is no.

968
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:08,578
Scott: So he's pretty much SOL.

969
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:13,340
Scott: So if you follow Robert's rules, they're not really benefiting one person or the other.

970
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:22,980
Scott: But when, say, a Congress that is dominated by one party makes up rules, they are not just making up these nice fair rules like Robert's rules, right?

971
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:25,860
Scott: They're making up rules that supposedly benefit them.

972
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,820
Scott: It's like if I'm playing Puerto Rico, I'm going to change the rules.

973
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:32,520
Scott: And if I'm playing corn, I'm going to be like, "Yeah, guys, corns were double the balloons now.

974
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:34,913
Rym: Actually, it's worth couldn't do double the balloons because I'm the corn

975
00:54:34,934 --> 00:54:35,177
Rym: king.".

976
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:43,140
Rym: That is fine in one sense, because one, Robert's Rules of Order kind of set up, you know, you can set up systems where changing the rules is way harder than just doing something.

977
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:51,320
Scott: Yeah, it's true, but still, there shouldn't be a system in which changing the rules benefits one or more of the people involved in the game.

978
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:52,400
Rym: That is a separate problem.

979
00:54:52,620 --> 00:55:00,380
Rym: What I'm getting at is that, one, the chair could be biased, but the rules have a way for people to appeal that.

980
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,300
Scott: Robert's Rules do, but not these congressional rules.

981
00:55:03,941 --> 00:55:04,678
Rym: Congressional rules do, too.

982
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:05,939
Rym: And this is what I'm getting at.

983
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,897
Rym: This is what bothers me.

984
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,599
Rym: They don't even follow their own goddamn rules.

985
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:15,379
Rym: It's one thing to make the rules stacked in your favor and then win because of that.

986
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,719
Rym: It's one thing to stack the rules in your favor and if you start to lose, to just cheat.

987
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:32,500
Rym: And the fact that people don't get that outraged about how we have this crazy procedure and sometimes we use it and sometimes we don't is one of the things that bothers me more than almost any other thing in American politics.

988
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,500
Scott: Do you think anyone even knows?

989
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,680
Scott: I mean, how many of these people even know Robert's Rules of Order exist?

990
00:55:37,662 --> 00:55:41,060
Rym: Yeah, so anyway, nerds especially, like D&D and gamer nerds.

991
00:55:41,142 --> 00:55:42,120
Scott: This is a super nerdy thing.

992
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:47,819
Rym: You could actually just take Robert's Rules of Order and figure out what you're going to eat for dinner.

993
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:50,120
Scott: Yeah, that's for a real decision.

994
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,580
Scott: I'm saying make up a fake decision.

995
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,039
Scott: Like, what's better, green or blue?

996
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:55,320
Scott: We're going to have a meeting.

997
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,066
Scott: You're the chair.

998
00:55:56,409 --> 00:55:57,540
Scott: Everyone else is just people.

999
00:55:58,529 --> 00:55:58,712
Scott: Go.

1000
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,320
Scott: It's a game.

1001
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,540
Rym: Point of order, I take personal affront to the fact that you even put blue in the same context.

1002
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:04,424
Scott: I agree.

1003
00:56:05,834 --> 00:56:06,357
Scott: Recognize.

1004
00:56:08,902 --> 00:56:11,900
Rym: But there's a certain mystique about Robert's Rules of Order.

1005
00:56:12,242 --> 00:56:19,692
Rym: If you talk to old grognards who play war games, they always have the story about how their gaming club on campus was meeting in like the 70s.

1006
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:28,579
Rym: And then the one fat dude showed up one day with a copy of Robert's Rules of Order and actually followed them and then ended up taking over the club and doing crazy crap.

1007
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:33,939
Rym: There's a certain mystique and sort of secret power in knowing about these things.

1008
00:56:34,381 --> 00:56:44,479
Rym: So if you want to be the cool kid and you're a freshman in college and you know Robert's Rules of Order, you can be the cool kid among a certain subset of the people at your school.

1009
00:56:47,206 --> 00:56:47,653
Rym: I move.

1010
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:48,140
Scott: I'm hungry.

1011
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,200
Rym: That we go get some dinner.

1012
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,580
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1013
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:02,700
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1014
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:08,100
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1015
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,040
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1016
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,759
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1017
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,291
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1018
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:23,600
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1019
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,720
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
