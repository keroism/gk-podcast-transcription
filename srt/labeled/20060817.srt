00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,216
Rym: It's Thursday August 17th, and this is GeekNights.

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,931
Rym: tonight We talk about hacking but not the kind of hacking you might expect for tonight.

3
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:19,879
Rym: We hacked the Wildwood, New Jersey boardwalk.

4
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,805
Rym: Let's do this Well GeekNights fans.

5
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:25,487
Rym: You're in luck.

6
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:26,249
Rym: today is prop.

7
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:30,460
Rym: well tonight is probably the last episode where I will not have a pop filter.

8
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:37,100
Scott: It's also going to be one hell of an entertaining episode if we know what people have liked in the past.

9
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:40,419
Rym: Yes, because we've done not one, but two stupid things.

10
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,505
Rym: oh Yeah, oh my god.

11
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:49,954
Rym: Oh my god, but before that because all of you You know really really seem to like it We have to do the news and the thing of the day and all that other stuff.

12
00:00:49,995 --> 00:01:00,553
Rym: but bear in mind That at every moment while we are speaking about these other mundane real-world issues We are just trying to hold back the torrent of awesome that is about to follow.

13
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:06,377
Scott: We are barely containing the Absolutely hysterical and crazy main bit for this episode.

14
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:06,860
Scott: You know what?

15
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:15,102
Scott: It's kind of weird because the main bit for this episode is in the same style as the things that people have greatly enjoyed in The past.

16
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:21,749
Scott: however all of those times in the past when people have greatly enjoyed an episode We said this episode is going to suck.

17
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,140
Scott: and now we're saying this episode is going to rock.

18
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:26,247
Scott: So let's see what happens.

19
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:32,760
Rym: in the very least even if the episode might end up being mad for whatever reason The things we did will speak for themselves.

20
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:36,828
Rym: They are the kinds of things that if we were not the ones doing them They would be things of the day.

21
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,854
Scott: They would be.

22
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:45,515
Rym: indeed now I believe Scott wanted to do a whole bunch of meta bits since we do have a Not a shit ton, but a good deal of new listeners from Otakon.

23
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:46,560
Scott: Oh, all right.

24
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:51,260
Scott: So for anyone out there GeekNights is a podcast.

25
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:52,706
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,980
Scott: Yeah, and we do four episodes a week.

27
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,570
Scott: So if you happen to subscribe to GeekNights Thursdays, guess what?

28
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:03,522
Scott: There are also GeekNights Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesdays And Let's see.

29
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:04,348
Scott: What else do you have to tell them?

30
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:05,174
Scott: We have a forum.

31
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:06,140
Scott: That's really awesome.

32
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:10,220
Rym: Yeah, the forum has people who may or may not actually even listen to the show at this point.

33
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,896
Scott: Yeah, and if you go there, they're cool people talking about stuff.

34
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:30,800
Scott: also surprisingly the forum comes up near the top on Google for a whole lot of really interesting search queries and Also, we have a frapper map if you go to front row crew calm, which is our website front row crew calm.

35
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:46,819
Scott: In the bottom right there's a little frapper link and if you click on it It brings you to this Google map and on the Google map You can put a pin on the map to show where you are And that way we can see where all the listeners are and it's pretty cool when for anyone to look at.

36
00:02:47,281 --> 00:03:00,500
Rym: But anyway, that's probably a good and not a good enough amount of that for now since somewhat soon As soon as we get new microphones and everything and we finish updating the website We're going to redo the closer and put all of that updated information in there.

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,296
Rym: So we never have to say this again when we get new listeners.

38
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:03,758
Scott: Hooray.

39
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:08,440
Rym: So without further ado, well, you've all been waiting for the news.

40
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:10,329
Scott: That's not what they're waiting for.

41
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:11,940
Scott: They're waiting for the mystery main bit.

42
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,133
Rym: No Because according to that thing we did trying to figure out what people like about the show.

43
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:19,125
Rym: the primary thing they like is the news And the things of the day.

44
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:19,990
Rym: Oh, okay.

45
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,860
Scott: Well here comes the news and the things today.

46
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,462
Rym: All right.

47
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:23,104
Rym: You want to go first?

48
00:03:23,144 --> 00:03:23,585
Rym: What do you got?

49
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:27,015
Rym: my news that you wouldn't tell me what your goddamn news was?

50
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:29,420
Scott: It's the main Mutant.

51
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,232
Scott: Apparently, I'm gonna paraphrase this entire story because it would go over.

52
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:36,435
Scott: all the details take too long.

53
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:41,540
Scott: in parts of Maine There is a legend of some sort of monster that way.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,483
Rym: Wait, wait a minute.

55
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:46,457
Rym: Is this that mutt dog with the deformed skull that someone ran over?

56
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,986
Rym: Yep That was on Fark a while ago.

57
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:49,067
Rym: Yep.

58
00:03:49,830 --> 00:04:01,320
Rym: Okay now I know exactly what you're talking about But go on anyway, because it's actually kind of interesting And of course everyone who is in the same camp as us was like crypto zoology, that's all bullshit.

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,344
Scott: There's no Bigfoot.

60
00:04:02,404 --> 00:04:04,091
Scott: There's no main monster.

61
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,315
Scott: There's no Loch Ness monster.

62
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:06,159
Scott: It's just a bunch of crap.

63
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:16,605
Scott: and You know this thing had like been attributed to like chasing down a few dogs and like it killed a Doberman or something That's Doberman will fight.

64
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,470
Rym: That's quite a achievement.

65
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:19,914
Scott: Yeah, and whatever.

66
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:22,140
Rym: I mean, I couldn't kill a Doberman with my bare hands.

67
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:32,750
Scott: No, so there was this legend of like this main monster that was like this horrible mutant deformed dog that did all sorts of bad things and you know, it was just a legend.

68
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:53,467
Scott: and Recently like I don't know in the past few weeks Someone was driving their car and his cat ran across the road and this mutant dog was chasing it and they hit it with their car and A bunch of people want to look at it and there's a couple of pictures I think on Fox News There was some pictures.

69
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:55,360
Rym: Yeah, the pictures are a little misleading.

70
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,720
Rym: It probably doesn't look quite that freaky because those pictures were post being run over by a car and rotting for a little while.

71
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,996
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much a slightly strange looking dog.

72
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:12,879
Scott: That's rotting and I think there were some pictures on another site that showed that it had weird claws that went up.

73
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:14,959
Scott: It was it was kind of strange.

74
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,820
Rym: Yeah, well that a lot of people have said that that part of the picture might just be an illusion.

75
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,451
Scott: No, no, no, I'll show it to you.

76
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,040
Rym: I only saw one picture on Fark.

77
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:25,067
Rym: I saw it for about 30 seconds.

78
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:31,607
Scott: the claws going up the extra claws that aren't natural for Dogs to have is definitely not an illusion.

79
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,149
Rym: Uh-huh.

80
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,900
Scott: So it's probably just some sort of strange dog.

81
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:45,892
Scott: Whatever, you know some cryptozoologist went to look at it and he said that it was probably a chow We that it turned feral Whatever.

82
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:51,790
Rym: Yeah, there was actually a long discussion on Fark as to what breeds of dog were probably mixed in there.

83
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,057
Scott: Yeah, it was just.

84
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,710
Scott: it was had a slight genetic Whatnot and it was a crazy feral wild animal.

85
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:08,782
Rym: Well, I do remember when I was in Michigan in high school in sterling heights There was a bit of a brouhaha when a liger Got loose and was roaming around.

86
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:10,208
Rym: Yes a real liger.

87
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:15,839
Rym: Okay Like it was Bradford skills and magic.

88
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,441
Scott: Okay.

89
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:16,983
Scott: There we go.

90
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:17,444
Scott: Okay.

91
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:25,695
Rym: Okay, and I Remember when I heard that on the news and the first thing I thought was there's no such thing as a liger What I thought?

92
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:30,910
Rym: and then I looked online and I found all this information on ligers and their magical powers.

93
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,934
Scott: Here's the thing about ligers.

94
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:34,620
Scott: I understand don't forget tigons.

95
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,362
Rym: They also exist.

96
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:37,890
Scott: Yeah, but if you're a lion, right?

97
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:43,730
Scott: Wouldn't you want to do the hot lion tempestresses and not the tiger tempestresses, I don't know.

98
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:46,410
Rym: I always thought tigers were generally better-looking than lions.

99
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:46,769
Scott: You know what?

100
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,518
Scott: I think there's only one way to find this out.

101
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,202
Scott: actually is we had to find some lion Furries and ask them if they're into the tiger furries and vice versa.

102
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:56,250
Rym: I think that's a good way to approach this.

103
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,437
Scott: Yep, so get right on that.

104
00:06:58,557 --> 00:07:00,764
Rym: It's no smoldering cheetah temptress.

105
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:02,289
Scott: But yeah, that's what I was going for.

106
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,279
Scott: Yeah yeah, of course, how can.

107
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:09,302
Rym: there's no cheetah's or Titus because the cheetah gets away.

108
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:14,230
Rym: Oh I Guess tigers went out because they have the nice stripes.

109
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,190
Rym: Some of them lions are generally kind of bland looking at least the females.

110
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,054
Rym: They don't know those big man.

111
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:23,509
Scott: We see like a Google video of a tiger clawing some guy.

112
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:24,989
Rym: Yes, we did.

113
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:30,770
Rym: So there was some idiot hunters on an elephant and they're throwing sticks at this tiger and this tiger is not happy.

114
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,082
Rym: So it jumps up and kills them all.

115
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:38,138
Rym: awesome Okay All right, yeah, so my thing of the day is somewhat.

116
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,883
Rym: very you mean your news yeah.

117
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:42,530
Rym: Oh, yeah news is right my news.

118
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,561
Scott: I know my news seems somewhat thing of the day.

119
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:45,928
Rym: is it is thing of the day ish.

120
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,803
Rym: Okay I got off track a little here.

121
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:52,878
Rym: Mm-hmm Yeah, my news is actually somewhat depressing and sad though It's really par for the course for this company.

122
00:07:52,939 --> 00:08:04,010
Rym: now for those of you who aren't familiar with Macro vision it is one of the earliest forms of well, I'd say DRM, but it's really ARM because it's analog.

123
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:07,970
Rym: I'm not going to explain how DRM or how DRM works.

124
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:27,056
Rym: I'm not doing to explain how macro vision works, but suffice to say macro vision is a method of Protecting things like VHS tapes where if you try to copy them Devices like VCRs all have a thing that will react to the macro vision that is in the signal and totally ruin the copy you're trying to make.

125
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:33,708
Scott: if you plug two VCRs into each other and try to copy a tape from one to The other macro vision will stop you.

126
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:42,034
Rym: Yes You also run into this problem as a side effect if you try to plug a DVD player Into a VCR.

127
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:50,960
Rym: because most people when DVD players came out didn't have RCA or component inputs into their TVs But they had VCRs which did so.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,467
Rym: what they did is most people tried to use their VCR as a RF modulator Which would have worked perfectly?

129
00:08:56,431 --> 00:09:10,196
Rym: Except for the fact that macro vision for a completely arbitrary reason blocks that and makes your DVD fade in and out and in and out because they don't want you to take your DVD and Record it onto a VHS tape.

130
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:16,559
Rym: so because there was such a trade in VHS rips of DVDs I know that there was gonna be.

131
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,590
Rym: I mean VHS is so high quality.

132
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:25,618
Scott: so the news about macro vision the evil fuckers is well the to put it very briefly a Company.

133
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:38,210
Rym: well there have been a lot of companies But there's one company in particular have made machines and methods of taking old VHS tapes and digitizing them in order to Archive the footage and record whatever video was in this old failing analog format.

134
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:52,030
Scott: There are many people who are in that business and all you really need is a computer with an in you know a card like an Aver or an ATI whatever Macro vision like the planet of the moles in Futurama was firing lawsuits everywhere about this.

135
00:09:52,411 --> 00:10:00,730
Rym: They do not want anyone to be able to crack macro vision or in any way Circumvent it in order to get data off of old analog tapes.

136
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,650
Scott: But what if I have my home movies on old analog tapes, and I want to put them on my computer?

137
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,386
Rym: Well the thing is your home movies probably don't have macro vision in them.

138
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:10,129
Scott: That is true.

139
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:22,336
Rym: However, however in general the best part about this is that they were trying to sue everyone under the DMCA the D MCA D D digital.

140
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:26,750
Rym: it is not a digital rights management is an analog rights management.

141
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:32,828
Rym: The law does not apply in any way because there is no digital mechanism whatsoever protecting the data.

142
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:35,240
Rym: good God, I almost ran out of breath there.

143
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,010
Scott: Wow that is true.

144
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:45,243
Rym: the thing is it's not just the issue that macro vision is being kind of evil and trying to Manhandle the laws into protecting their crappy DRM.

145
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:47,110
Rym: Well ARM that doesn't even really work so well.

146
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:58,170
Rym: I mean, it's trivially circum circumvented, but more so than that Macro vision has in general for as long as it has existed been one of the most evil entities out there in the world.

147
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:10,830
Scott: This is basically a company that has made a product and then they make a law that says Anyone who is in this business must purchase our product and become our customer.

148
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:15,230
Scott: I mean and they make another law that says we can never go out of business.

149
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:16,541
Scott: We must always get money.

150
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:17,610
Scott: Well, I mean what the hell?

151
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:29,710
Scott: I mean if what a McDonald's said everyone must eat at McDonald's it when they want a hamburger and if McDonald's doesn't make enough money then you know people have to pay McDonald's to keep it in business.

152
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:31,356
Scott: You don't make laws like that.

153
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:33,967
Scott: That's so far from what capitalism is.

154
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:34,670
Scott: It's insane.

155
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,246
Scott: I mean that's that's even worse than communism.

156
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:51,629
Rym: now luckily some good news here is that while they originally won their case pretty much the Injunction that was put in place is now being reviewed and on the whole number of organizations Including among other people the wonderful EFF

157
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,573
Scott: Of course

158
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:58,152
Rym: are right there and I have a feeling that the judges aren't going to be stupid and macro vision is going to die In a fire,

159
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:06,138
Scott: you know if I was like the FCC or whoever can do whatever about this I would just make say macro vision.

160
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:09,069
Scott: everyone in charge of macro vision goes to jail and the company's gone.

161
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:09,410
Scott: Goodbye.

162
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:11,879
Rym: No, I wouldn't put him in jail, yeah, I would.

163
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:14,550
Rym: now I just make their company go away.

164
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,794
Scott: No, I put him in jail.

165
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:16,235
Rym: Why would you?

166
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:21,370
Rym: but we have enough for we rail against the prison industrial complex constantly.

167
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:23,057
Rym: We hate jails.

168
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:27,229
Scott: That's the point is like, you know, cuz that most of the people put in jail Don't need to go to jail.

169
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:38,670
Scott: But the thing is if you take the heads of macro vision or probably these rich assholes You know who are just evil and you put him in jail You don't need to put them in there for like a month and it had to be a real jail.

170
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:45,670
Scott: None of this like, you know jail with no fences Country Club crap, you know, you know that there aren't so many of those.

171
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:47,116
Rym: It's not really that way.

172
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:49,206
Scott: the media really governor of Connecticut went to one.

173
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:53,084
Rym: I saw it yeah, but the media always makes it out like those minimum security.

174
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:59,570
Rym: prisons aren't so bad and There really are kind of bad because you're still trapped in there with a lot of really terrible people.

175
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,398
Scott: You're not being raped in the ass.

176
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:04,049
Scott: You have to send into a prison where you get raped in the ass.

177
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:07,610
Rym: I'm generally against this whole people being raped in the ass in prison business.

178
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:10,210
Scott: I'm for it as long as I'm not in prison.

179
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:14,230
Rym: Well, here's the thing the prison industry proves a whole bunch of stuff.

180
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,610
Scott: I mean look we can't keep God's not do an episode about prison.

181
00:13:18,012 --> 00:13:20,161
Scott: All right, the point is is the macro vision.

182
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:22,070
Scott: people are bad and I want them to be harmed.

183
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,137
Rym: Well, how about they just die in a fire?

184
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:28,230
Scott: that works, but can they be raped in the ass before they die in a fire?

185
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:35,925
Rym: I mean, I've run afoul of macro vision so many times and the thing is the vast majority of those times I was not even trying to break the law.

186
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:56,103
Scott: most of the time We were just trying to watch a DVD on an old television Through a VCR and they would fade dark and light and dark and light and it was just annoying things of the day of Today.

187
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:56,765
Rym: Oh, wow.

188
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:58,290
Rym: You didn't say thingy.

189
00:13:58,451 --> 00:13:59,735
Scott: I know I tried to change it up.

190
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:00,939
Rym: Wow good for you.

191
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,980
Rym: Yep, all right my thing of the day.

192
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:19,200
Rym: I had something else and it was some old thing that was actually kind of cool But I had to change it up because Scott showed me something and then I remembered that today is Pretty much the beginning of all the premieres for probably our favorite movie of the year snakes on a motherfucking plane

193
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,319
Scott: motherfucker.

194
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,325
Scott: Now, oh my god.

195
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,353
Rym: This is actually quite hilarious.

196
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:29,059
Rym: It is Samuel L. Jackson Appearing on The Daily Show talking about soap.

197
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:32,229
Scott: Yeah, that's actually worth, you know, it's like.

198
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:37,891
Scott: I'm not gonna pay to see this movie You know just because of what they've done.

199
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,580
Scott: I'm not gonna support it with money.

200
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:41,462
Rym: See, here's the thing.

201
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:44,972
Scott: However, I enjoy the craziness that's going around.

202
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:49,985
Rym: I support it for one reason and one reason alone Because originally I mean one.

203
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:59,940
Rym: I've told the story of snakes on a plane before because for anyone who isn't hit to the internet This snakes on a plane thing may seem like it's new like it's been exploding for the past few months.

204
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,032
Rym: I don't think you all realize just how long this is.

205
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:13,880
Rym: movie has been known about and made fun of on Fark Years, I mean to the point that the the line snakes on a motherfucking plane and got them.

206
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:17,170
Rym: The origin of that was not in the movie originally.

207
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:28,880
Rym: it can very likely be traced to some of the early photoshops when people heard about the title of this movie and Then they heard that Samuel L. Jackson was gonna be in it and they started making fun of it.

208
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:40,620
Rym: But the fact that Samuel L. Jackson and the people who were doing this movie Recognized that the internet had found their movie and liked it and took it was hard not to recognize.

209
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:44,718
Scott: Yes, it was literally be not on the internet to know about snakes on a.

210
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:52,819
Rym: well No, I mean when because the thing is a lot of this came after the fact They had to have been reading Fark or new people who read Fark or possibly like 4chan.

211
00:15:53,421 --> 00:16:01,600
Scott: I imagine they were doing it just going on casually and then Someone noticed and one guy came along and he's like, hey guys check this shit out.

212
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:09,660
Scott: Yeah, probably some intern was like, alright guys I was on Fark and they probably went oh shit Wait a minute and then dollar sign showed up in the eyeballs.

213
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,260
Rym: But the fact that they took all the advice of the internet and they basically made the movie the internet wanted.

214
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:21,619
Rym: We're going to find out if the movies that the internet wants are movies that the internet actually wants, you know, what's coming soon?

215
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:22,770
Scott: Go see.

216
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,706
Rym: the movie Go see is not a movie.

217
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,895
Rym: go see is if anything the flag of the Internet.

218
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:31,433
Rym: I agree Well that we have much to say about goat.

219
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:32,500
Rym: see me do indeed.

220
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:37,980
Rym: But first anyway, if you have any chance at all, I highly recommend you watch this video of Samuel L. Jackson.

221
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:41,220
Scott: It's probably just as good as watching snakes on a plane the movie.

222
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:45,615
Rym: Well, the thing is Sam is really a funny guy and I always enjoy watching interviews with him.

223
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:46,077
Scott: Yep.

224
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:46,418
Scott: Yep.

225
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,608
Scott: He's cool All right, my thing of the day now.

226
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:52,538
Rym: you didn't you refuse to tell me what your thing of the day was.

227
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:53,260
Scott: Oh, it's awesome.

228
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,100
Scott: It's called Just one Club card.

229
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:59,831
Scott: What this is is you have Club cards, right?

230
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:00,935
Scott: I got the shop right one.

231
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:01,598
Rym: Wait a minute.

232
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:02,080
Rym: Wait a minute.

233
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:07,217
Rym: Is this the guy who copied his barcode put it on the internet and told everyone to use it?

234
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:08,119
Rym: No, okay.

235
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:10,618
Scott: And you got the stop and shop one, right?

236
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:13,928
Scott: Yeah, and I think you know a bunch of places have.

237
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,873
Rym: I have the discount liquor one.

238
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:16,295
Scott: Yeah.

239
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,538
Rym: Well that I have a.

240
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:21,140
Scott: There's a Dominic's is a possibility.

241
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,503
Rym: No, you know why I have a Dominic's?

242
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:35,340
Rym: because when I went to anime central the first time which was God that was like 2002 We threw that party and we drove around Chicago looking for a grocery store to buy mixers for the non-alcoholic bar.

243
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:45,004
Rym: we were gonna run in the room because the room had a full bar in it and We found a Dominic's and Scott Johnson got a Dominic's card and then he gave it to me So he wouldn't lose it.

244
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:49,859
Rym: and then the next year when we went back to Chicago We went to the same Dominic's and used it again.

245
00:17:50,295 --> 00:18:00,619
Scott: Yeah well if you're like me and You have a Jimmy wallet or you have some wallet that can't hold a lot of cards or you hate having all that shit hanging On your keychain, you know one for every possible place.

246
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:20,939
Scott: There's a website where you can choose up to eight different cards from eight different places Or eight of the same place if you like that and you type in the number under your barcode For each of those places and it will allow you to print out one card with eight barcodes on it.

247
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,271
Scott: And it supports a lot of places.

248
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,778
Scott: I mean A&P Albertsons.

249
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:34,212
Rym: by low At least one-dimensional barcodes are not terribly difficult to reverse engineer.

250
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:37,720
Scott: Yeah, stop and shop staples PetSmart Petco.

251
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:46,562
Rym: The next step of this is to make a small website where people can publish much like bug me not numbers from their cards Mm-hmm.

252
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:51,897
Rym: That way we can totally randomize everything and completely ruin this entire tiny industry.

253
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:52,760
Rym: I agree.

254
00:18:53,622 --> 00:19:03,180
Scott: But yeah, this is just awesome because now if you have if your wallet is full of these club cards You know one for every store and you just have them to like get know what you know what forget the website.

255
00:19:03,747 --> 00:19:04,699
Rym: We're gonna do that in the forums.

256
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:10,681
Rym: I'm going to post all my discount card numbers and Scott will do the same and we urge all of you to do this as Well,

257
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:23,669
Scott: yeah, and that way if anyone needs a discount card instead of signing up for it you just go to this just one Club card website type in someone else's Club card number and Print out a working barcode card.

258
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,114
Rym: Yeah, and it's not like.

259
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:31,478
Scott: and you have one card, you know You can decrease the number of cards you have in your wallet by a factor of eight and it's not like.

260
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:34,731
Rym: this can be used To hurt anyone because there's no way you can you.

261
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,800
Rym: I mean, it's just information about what you buy.

262
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,866
Rym: Yeah, like these aren't.

263
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:39,173
Scott: these aren't credit cards.

264
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:40,400
Scott: These are discount cards.

265
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,085
Scott: I mean, we're not even talking about reward cards here, you know, I mean, well, I think some of them might be reward cards Whatever.

266
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:52,131
Scott: Yeah, these are mostly discount cards like if you have the card you get a discount.

267
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:56,159
Scott: if you don't you don't and It's you know, generally sort of a not.

268
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,800
Scott: I mean you can sign up for one of these things with fake information and they'll give it to you.

269
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:08,816
Rym: Yeah, in fact the Wegmans car or no the stop-and-shop car that I used for a number of years and I still have is One that I found on the ground outside of a stop-and-shop.

270
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:13,735
Rym: once yep The shop right one Scott got semi legitimately the Wegmans one.

271
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:14,819
Rym: I used a fake ID.

272
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:21,498
Scott: Yeah, the other the other advantage of this is you know Like I have a shop right card Rym has a stop-and-shop one.

273
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:31,065
Scott: now We both have both because we're both gonna print it out Great and if someone looks at you funny for taking a little piece of paper and waving it over the barcode thing You just give them the finger.

274
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:32,936
Scott: if it beeps it beeps fuck.

275
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:35,431
Scott: Yep So this is way cool way.

276
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:37,303
Rym: So, you know what.

277
00:20:37,765 --> 00:20:41,780
Rym: all of you go to the forums and post your information and we're going to make something awesome.

278
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:42,964
Rym: Yep, cool.

279
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:43,626
Rym: All right.

280
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:45,733
Rym: I don't think we can contain it anymore.

281
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:46,937
Rym: It is time.

282
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:47,940
Scott: Let's get on with it.

283
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:54,854
Rym: I think before we describe exactly what we did in the events that went down in Wildwood, New Jersey Talk about our new motto.

284
00:20:55,317 --> 00:21:05,037
Rym: All right I will tell the story of the motto and then Scott can describe what kind of place Wildwood New Jersey is because that is critical for the story that is about to be told extremely critical.

285
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:05,720
Rym: now.

286
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:09,040
Rym: We are good friend Yuko who she does a webcomic.

287
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,500
Rym: She's a wonderful artist and she hung out with us along with all of our other friends during what we call the week of awesome.

288
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:19,298
Rym: Every year the front row crew gets together and for an entire one the hobo one.

289
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:30,612
Rym: Yes For an entire week after Otakon we all congregate somewhere often Wildwood and Generally do things together and make an awesome week of it.

290
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:33,020
Rym: It's like our annual homecoming.

291
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:43,371
Rym: Now Yuko stayed at RIT along with our good friend Conrad and a bunch of other people at home bad home bad and we'd all graduated and they were all.

292
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:58,399
Rym: they were on the eboard of the RIT anime club and One day they were in one of the meetings and Yuko apparently drew on a little piece of paper a little note with a doodle on it and the words on this note were Hey Conrad, let's do dumb shit after this.

293
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,665
Rym: Now this was hilarious.

294
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:12,800
Rym: The note was hilarious and the the words let's do dumb shit after this which has been shortened somewhat to Let's do dumb shit has recently caught on as the new logo and catchphrase of the front row crew.

295
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,658
Scott: It's a motto not a logo motto, yeah, let's do dumb shit.

296
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:19,939
Scott: everybody You know, it's like we used to freak some squares.

297
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:23,134
Scott: That was the thing we used to do before is freak the squares now.

298
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:24,380
Scott: Let's just do dumb shit.

299
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:30,480
Rym: Yeah, basically we use this term to refer to the things we do that typically become funny stories later.

300
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:37,000
Scott: Yeah things that would have been previously referred to as freaking squares or possibly having a vision.

301
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:38,386
Scott: Oh my vision.

302
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:39,271
Scott: I have this vision.

303
00:22:39,572 --> 00:22:41,099
Rym: I have a vision of us doing dumb shit.

304
00:22:43,581 --> 00:22:46,230
Scott: Who might freak squares and we'll do dumb shit.

305
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:46,511
Scott: Okay.

306
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:47,293
Rym: Yeah, we should.

307
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:47,936
Rym: we'll tell the.

308
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:49,220
Rym: I have a vision story someday.

309
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:50,665
Scott: That's an okay story.

310
00:22:50,846 --> 00:22:52,974
Rym: Did we ever tell the bamboo story that goes along with it?

311
00:22:53,335 --> 00:22:57,245
Rym: No, good God That's a different episode.

312
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:59,674
Rym: someone remind us to talk about the bamboo.

313
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:04,528
Scott: the bamboo and The vision will be an episode together.

314
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,254
Scott: put that in the forum thingy.

315
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:09,404
Rym: I have a vision of bamboo Bamboo visions.

316
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:09,946
Rym: Oh god.

317
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:11,452
Rym: That was one of the worst days of my life.

318
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:18,680
Scott: So Wildwood, New Jersey Wildwood, New Jersey is basically a beach a public beach.

319
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:29,818
Scott: that means anyone who wants to for no money can go and sit on the sand in the sun and go in the Atlantic Ocean and get wet and play with crabs and get crabbed.

320
00:23:29,838 --> 00:23:36,140
Scott: and Yeah, jellyfish jellyfished and dig in the sand and all that good stuff by a fudgy wudgy.

321
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,317
Scott: Yep, there's a guy walking with ice cream, but you need to pay him.

322
00:23:39,357 --> 00:23:39,799
Scott: That's not free.

323
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:47,249
Scott: it's also incredibly touristy as Public beaches are want to be now attached to.

324
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:51,340
Rym: the beach is one of the biggest old-school boardwalks around.

325
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:56,840
Scott: Yes, it is a long boardwalk with many piers that aren't don't really jut out into the water.

326
00:23:56,941 --> 00:23:58,416
Scott: They jut out into the sand.

327
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:02,480
Scott: now The boardwalk is sort of far back from the actual water for anyone.

328
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,218
Rym: I mean boardwalks are really a thing that only exists on ocean coasts in New Jersey.

329
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,444
Scott: Yeah No, there's there's.

330
00:24:08,504 --> 00:24:09,791
Rym: there are a bunch of boardwalks out west.

331
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:11,400
Scott: there are but they're big in New Jersey.

332
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:12,522
Rym: Yeah There is.

333
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:18,279
Rym: he is like the boardwalk state and they're really not that common in the world as a whole.

334
00:24:18,661 --> 00:24:20,180
Rym: No, and they're kind of going out of style.

335
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,819
Rym: But basically you have a beach and then someone builds piers, you know for ships and they go out.

336
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:39,820
Rym: But instead of having ships go on those piers They put buildings on those piers and then the boardwalk which is literally a boardwalk it's a whole bunch of boards held up like a deck and Then they put shops and arcades and things all along it or casinos or whatever.

337
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:45,614
Scott: Yep So the boardwalk in Wildly, New Jersey is the schlockiest place on earth.

338
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:58,420
Scott: if you're looking for touristy dreck carny games arcades Any of that sort of shit, you know greasy food and funnel cake one dollar pizza one dollar pizza slices.

339
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:00,860
Scott: This is the place to go.

340
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,340
Scott: I mean if you want a cheap t-shirt if you want like a one dollar bathing suit

341
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:09,579
Rym: If I want a snow globe with a picture of a duck in it

342
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:17,600
Scott: Yeah, if you want like a bootleg, you know dollar store f1 car that where all the names on it are changed.

343
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:19,084
Scott: This is the place.

344
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,049
Rym: Yeah, I mean it's.

345
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,140
Rym: I don't want to say it's low-class, but it's pretty low-class in general.

346
00:25:25,282 --> 00:25:26,198
Scott: I'm quite low brow.

347
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:28,347
Rym: Granted we love Wildwood.

348
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:32,564
Rym: Oh, it's so great in addition to having all this stuff Which is just a hilarious to see.

349
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:38,260
Rym: it has probably one of the last bastions of true arcade culture in this entire country.

350
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:42,305
Rym: Indeed Wildwood has some of the best arcades I've been to in a decade.

351
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:46,322
Scott: three DDR supernovas right next to DDR.

352
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:52,076
Scott: seventh makes a in the groove two and two air hockey machine to regulation air hockey machine.

353
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:58,377
Rym: Yeah photons bitches Yeah, so Wildwood is our arcade capital where we go every year to play arcade games.

354
00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:04,580
Scott: now You might imagine that much of the boardwalk is not arcades and therefore what do we care?

355
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,433
Scott: You know, in fact to most geeks, it would be painful.

356
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:08,700
Scott: You see carny games.

357
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,354
Scott: You see food that while tasty and most geeks will eat it.

358
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:16,340
Scott: You can't eat too much of it or you'll die.

359
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:21,854
Scott: Yeah, and you see like schlocky t-shirt places selling t-shirts.

360
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:24,060
Scott: that's a really really dumb shit on them.

361
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:25,753
Rym: Yeah, like God, what was that one?

362
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:26,660
Rym: There was this one shirt.

363
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:34,780
Rym: It was big and black and it said like Master of the game in like four different fonts and it had this big bulldog and the bulldog was biting through a football.

364
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:39,680
Scott: Yeah, I mean that kind of crap like really cheap crap t-shirts and stuff.

365
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:47,671
Scott: So, you know that stuff is generally not interesting and even off-putting to most geeks Except the first time you go to a place like that.

366
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:49,620
Rym: Oh, yeah the first time you're just overwhelmed.

367
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,660
Rym: It's like this crazy carnival of color and lights and you can barely keep your senses.

368
00:26:53,721 --> 00:27:00,439
Scott: But if you go there You know for many many years year after year for and you stay there for many many days like an entire week.

369
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:06,100
Scott: I mean people barely spend a day there usually a weekend if they're lucky we spend a week there.

370
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:08,513
Rym: I once lived there for about a month.

371
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:15,520
Scott: Yeah, so Eventually you see through that and it just becomes like, you know, it's it's a boardwalk whatever.

372
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:19,154
Rym: Yeah, so we other than playing DDR we had grown somewhat tired with the boardwalk.

373
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:20,620
Scott: There are go-karts there, which are also cool.

374
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,952
Rym: I mean every year we'd walk the length of it to show the new people we brought.

375
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:24,775
Rym: but other than that.

376
00:27:25,156 --> 00:27:33,560
Scott: Yeah, so This year we finally figured out how to breathe new life into this carny sort of drech schlock.

377
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:35,366
Scott: You know crappy boardwalk.

378
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,152
Rym: The answer is hacking.

379
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:43,711
Scott: Yes now not computer hacking But hacking the boardwalk, I mean hacking is a really generic term.

380
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:46,498
Rym: I mean social engineering is really just people hacking.

381
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:48,268
Rym: Yep At RIT.

382
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:51,652
Rym: We always tried to do elevator hacking And we always failed.

383
00:27:51,935 --> 00:28:01,997
Rym: Yeah Now and Wildwood there are a number of ways that we've learned and we had so many ideas We only had the chance to undertake two of them.

384
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:09,179
Scott: Yep well now the idea of hacking in general is to take something and to sort of repurpose or enhance it.

385
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:19,077
Scott: like if you Find a way to use your cell phone to also open the door to your house and remote control your television That's hacking, you know.

386
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:29,980
Scott: so we're take we're going to or we did attempt and succeed to take the schlocky drek shit on the boardwalk and Repurpose it into awesome.

387
00:28:30,782 --> 00:28:38,040
Rym: So the question now is which of the two stories do we tell first the best t-shirt in the world or the best food?

388
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,760
Scott: In the world, I think the best t-shirt in the world has to come first because it came first chronologically All right.

389
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:46,690
Rym: So at one point we were walking past as a whole.

390
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:53,980
Rym: the whole front row crew for the most part was walking past this one Shop and we see a sign wait, but there are many many stores on the boardwalk.

391
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,496
Scott: They sell cheap t-shirts and this was one of them.

392
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:57,080
Rym: now.

393
00:28:57,301 --> 00:29:02,020
Rym: This one stood out to us in a way that none had ever had before and it was definitely a recent development.

394
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:21,659
Scott: Yes There was an eight and a half by eleven piece of paper poorly clipped on to one of their t-shirt displays and on it in plain black text was printed the words any band you want and Next to it was another one that said any wrestler you want and I said, all right.

395
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:29,675
Scott: All right They probably have every wrestler But there has to be some obscure ass band that they don't have a t-shirt for.

396
00:29:29,896 --> 00:29:31,620
Rym: and the t-shirts were fairly high quality.

397
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,013
Rym: They were definitely a couple steps up from just an iron-on.

398
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:40,292
Scott: Yep, and I said Alright either you know immediately after about a minute of thinking about it.

399
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:46,646
Scott: I'm like, okay either they're false advertising and we're gonna pun them or They have some sort of.

400
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:51,240
Scott: they can print t-shirts from computer images device.

401
00:29:51,775 --> 00:29:51,960
Rym: Yeah.

402
00:29:52,181 --> 00:30:00,740
Rym: So we basically realized that they were either going to be completely stupid and false advertising or they were doing something illegal and we decided That either way this was going to be hilarious.

403
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:03,558
Scott: So we go into the store and I asked my friend Pete.

404
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:10,078
Scott: I said hey Think of the most obscure band you can think of and he calls his brother who knows even more obscure bands.

405
00:30:10,178 --> 00:30:13,599
Scott: and they come up with the band nihilist spasm band.

406
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:16,104
Scott: and I'm like, okay, let's go in.

407
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:17,248
Scott: and Pete asked them.

408
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,119
Scott: Can we have a t-shirt for nihilist spasm band?

409
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:26,558
Scott: and They get to work on their computer and I'm like, okay, are they using Google Images?

410
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:27,140
Scott: What are they doing?

411
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:34,325
Scott: And Eventually this girl turns around with a pretty poor image of the nihilist spasm band logo and we go Oh, it's Google Images.

412
00:30:34,425 --> 00:30:35,248
Scott: Okay.

413
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:35,850
Scott: All right.

414
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:38,420
Rym: So we told the people, you know, what are you doing is illegal?

415
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,871
Rym: Not that we care, but you're totally breaking the law.

416
00:30:40,911 --> 00:30:41,915
Rym: and we walked out laughing.

417
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:45,196
Scott: Yeah, we're just like, yeah We just wanted to see how you did it, you know, etc, etc.

418
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,009
Scott: And we walked out laughing and they were kind of whatever.

419
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:48,672
Scott: and that was that.

420
00:30:49,053 --> 00:30:55,560
Rym: now later on that evening We were playing DDR and playing games in the house and an idea started to foment.

421
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:58,709
Rym: And I fermentation produces poison.

422
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:02,903
Rym: because we started thinking wait a minute so they can make a t-shirt of anything Huh?

423
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:12,110
Rym: by the same token We can tell them a word and they will look up a picture of that word and there is no way they will avoid seeing that picture.

424
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:17,363
Rym: Go see go see go see go to go to go to go to go to go to go to you We're just.

425
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:20,620
Scott: we figured we would walk into the store say can we have a goat's t-shirt?

426
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:22,748
Scott: Yeah, and they would see goatse and go.

427
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:23,813
Scott: Oh, oh god.

428
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:25,160
Scott: Oh god, and we'd laugh and walk out.

429
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:31,256
Rym: And then our friend Pete goes one step further and says why don't we actually get a goatse t-shirt?

430
00:31:31,777 --> 00:31:35,262
Scott: Oh my god brilliant genius.

431
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:45,659
Rym: now we're sitting there and we're just awed by this idea because nothing would please me more in the world than to wear on my Chest proudly a picture of a man stretching his own anus apart.

432
00:31:46,785 --> 00:32:04,911
Scott: I mean we've taken what was five minutes ago a Drexlock store that in no geek would care about and only stupid, you know American consumer tourists on vacation would even consider spending money at and turned it into an Amazing like pool of potential.

433
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:05,332
Scott: awesome.

434
00:32:05,935 --> 00:32:07,320
Scott: now go see awesome.

435
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:18,500
Rym: The final step came when and I'm not going to be modest about this I had a stroke of genius and I said the words We should put the First Amendment in text on this shirt.

436
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:22,300
Scott: And we said, holy shit, that is absolutely right.

437
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:33,980
Rym: so the t-shirt we envision now is goatse and then the First Amendment in text around it in Big black letters and we're like, ah, that would be the best t-shirt ever.

438
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:36,629
Scott: Like oh my god amazing.

439
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:38,736
Rym: and Pete says I'll do it.

440
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:40,481
Scott: We'll do it we.

441
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:44,098
Scott: so we went to the t-shirt place that night and we said, all right.

442
00:32:44,118 --> 00:32:56,133
Scott: and As soon as he walked in the girl recognized us and she's like, oh no, no, no You guys are here before you're not gonna do the same trick again, and we're like, no, no, we're serious You want a shirt really and she's like really really.

443
00:32:56,815 --> 00:33:00,007
Scott: so we go in and we're like Okay, guys goatse and I had to.

444
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:05,972
Scott: at first we had to instruct them how to turn off their filter on On Google Images.

445
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:13,370
Rym: now The other thing is the fact that they didn't immediately recognize the word goatse means that they are not Technology savvy people.

446
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,338
Scott: No, they were not.

447
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:17,125
Scott: we had To find the image.

448
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:23,205
Scott: I had to guide them to Wikipedia and then from there guide them to the Mirror of goatse.

449
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:28,605
Rym: I mean regardless of your feelings for the actual image, which is pretty horrific I'm not going to say it isn't.

450
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:31,439
Rym: that is an iconic thing at this point.

451
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,814
Rym: goatse is like this legendary piece of the internet and whether you like it or not.

452
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:37,580
Rym: That is a part of our human history.

453
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:38,524
Scott: Yes, it is.

454
00:33:38,544 --> 00:33:45,655
Scott: I mean if you've never seen it before it's quite horrific But once you've seen it a thousand times, it's just nothing.

455
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:46,158
Scott: It's just up.

456
00:33:46,218 --> 00:33:46,740
Scott: It look it's goats.

457
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:50,879
Rym: I mean in the mid 90s, there was nothing more fun than tricking people into seeing that image.

458
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:55,460
Scott: But nowadays it's like oh you haven't seen goatse if you've been living under a rock.

459
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,256
Scott: That's like saying you've never seen the American flag.

460
00:33:58,276 --> 00:33:58,880
Scott: What's wrong with you?

461
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,485
Rym: Remember that thing of the day we did where that one guy showed people who had never seen it and then took pictures of their faces.

462
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:14,467
Scott: the moment there is a Group or something of pictures of people seeing goatse for the first time the best was Ron Jeremy because his face is like What the fuck is that?

463
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:15,935
Scott: And he's Ron Jeremy.

464
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:16,920
Rym: and then his second face.

465
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,797
Rym: He's looking at it more closely and has this look of just utter disgust.

466
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:28,119
Scott: Yeah all right, so We go in and we try to wheel and deal this guy to make the goatse shirt.

467
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:39,154
Scott: And he seemed you know after all the employees in the store or you know having a fun time and we're having a fun time You know, they didn't really seem apprehensive about making it like that.

468
00:34:39,174 --> 00:34:40,418
Scott: You're like, yeah, we'll make it for you.

469
00:34:41,141 --> 00:34:44,678
Scott: And then we're like, alright, we want you to write the First Amendment on it and they're like, yeah, we can do that.

470
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,512
Scott: We're like, oh shit.

471
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:47,458
Scott: It's this awesome.

472
00:34:49,710 --> 00:35:01,280
Scott: And Eventually, you know, they had a printer there which printed out some sort of t-shirt Screening stuff and they had some sort of machine and they got a t-shirt and plain white shirt and they went.

473
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:05,664
Scott: And there you know it there's the shirt Really?

474
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:07,880
Scott: Well done very well done.

475
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,558
Scott: I mean it was a picture of goatse with the words the First Amendment on it.

476
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:14,159
Scott: Perfect It looked like a t-shirt you bought in the store.

477
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:15,838
Scott: It was so great.

478
00:35:16,703 --> 00:35:19,353
Scott: And then our friend had to deal with them on the price of the shirt.

479
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:33,440
Rym: now Pete pointed out later he wished he'd realized this earlier that he was in a very high position in terms of the Debate over the price because quite simply no one else in the world would have bought that shirt and it was already made.

480
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:41,470
Rym: So basically he could have said five bucks or I'm not taking it and then walked away and they would have been stuck with This shirt, they probably just throwing it out.

481
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,419
Scott: that shirt probably cost them less than five bucks.

482
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,338
Scott: Maybe they don't care, you know, but anyway now, but I think he eventually paid like 30 for it.

483
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:51,389
Rym: Yeah, I think it was worth it.

484
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,899
Scott: Yeah, it was definitely worth it.

485
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:56,419
Scott: And you know, it's sort of like, you know, we put the guy through a bunch of trouble.

486
00:35:56,902 --> 00:35:58,168
Scott: We made him look at goat.

487
00:35:58,188 --> 00:35:58,971
Scott: see what about.

488
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:00,740
Scott: it's okay if we get ripped off on it.

489
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:07,433
Rym: I think my favorite part is when you said something to him like Yeah, it's not as bad as like lemon party or all that other stuff.

490
00:36:07,654 --> 00:36:08,980
Scott: and then he wanted to look it up.

491
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:16,207
Scott: He wanted to look up lemon party and tub girl because I mentioned I Think we tainted them.

492
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:17,760
Scott: We did indeed taint them.

493
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,060
Rym: You know what have been the best if after this was all done we'd call the police because they were breaking the law.

494
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:25,540
Scott: Otherwise, that would have been hilarious should have been like give us this t-shirt for free.

495
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,771
Scott: We're calling the cops on your bootlegging operation.

496
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:28,334
Rym: You know what.

497
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,673
Rym: if they're next there next year I think we'll have some words with them.

498
00:36:31,097 --> 00:36:31,299
Scott: Yeah.

499
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:44,295
Rym: So anyway, the moral of the story here is that if you go to the link to the discussion from this post About this show right now in the forum are all the pictures of this shirt.

500
00:36:44,676 --> 00:36:45,780
Scott: It's two pictures of the shirt.

501
00:36:46,002 --> 00:36:46,631
Rym: Yeah, all of them.

502
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:58,719
Scott: Yeah Well, actually no, I think we can only do one link from the post to the forum and There's gonna be two forum things one for this story and one for the other story, huh?

503
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:00,547
Rym: Yeah, are we gonna do that?

504
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:01,169
Rym: I'll link to him.

505
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,740
Scott: some just link to him in the post instead of with the forum.

506
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:05,385
Rym: There will be an obvious link.

507
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:05,906
Scott: Yes.

508
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:06,990
Scott: All right.

509
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:10,240
Rym: Anyway now this emboldened us.

510
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:22,040
Scott: Yes, we realized wow, there is potential here and these things on the boardwalk to create amusement for us, you know Cuz these things are designed to amuse idiots who just like to buy crap.

511
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:24,913
Scott: So we need a lot more.

512
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,319
Scott: I don't know.

513
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:41,920
Scott: We need different things to bring us amusement and Places and things that previously brought us no joy and in fact often pain Where now could be repurposed to bring us hours upon hours of entertainment and joy.

514
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:53,100
Scott: So we just had to find more ways to utilize Things on this boardwalk to make them entertaining to create good to make lemonade from lemons.

515
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:55,439
Rym: If life gives you shit, what do you make?

516
00:37:56,402 --> 00:37:57,084
Scott: Shit pie.

517
00:37:57,264 --> 00:37:57,565
Rym: Yeah.

518
00:37:57,685 --> 00:38:04,121
Rym: Anyway now I noticed just now as I'm thinking about it that we use Pete more than anything to accomplish all of This.

519
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:07,811
Rym: yes, because Pete is pivotal in the second thing we did.

520
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:13,689
Rym: Mmm now last year Pete had ordered a caramel Funnel cake which defeated him.

521
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:16,899
Scott: Yeah, I mean you used to be you just got a funnel cake.

522
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:21,176
Scott: nowadays You can get deep-fried Oreos, which is Oreo in funnel cake.

523
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,145
Scott: It's really good You can get.

524
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:23,467
Scott: you know.

525
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:27,522
Scott: funnel cakes with powdered sugar on them funnel cakes with Caramel.

526
00:38:27,743 --> 00:38:31,878
Rym: now, there's one cinnamon apple funnel cakes that has pretty much anything in the world.

527
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:37,073
Rym: deep-fried I mean they have every candy bar Apples, they'll just deep-fry anything they've got.

528
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:38,520
Rym: Yeah, they'll do anything you want.

529
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,295
Scott: They'll put it in funnel cake batter deep-fry it and serve it up to you.

530
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:48,720
Rym: So Pete has always been thinking because he'd always order like the craziest thing like the cheese fry pizza or the caramel.

531
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:51,080
Scott: He has a history of eating weird things.

532
00:38:51,200 --> 00:39:09,939
Scott: I remember there was a place called pita pit where you could get in our God we get any pita you wanted and You know I. he said that there was impossible to make a bad pita from the pita pit menu and I challenged him to this and I Concocted from the pita pit menu perhaps the worst combination of pita you could get.

533
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:18,400
Scott: I mean It's pretty much like every kind of nasty sauce and all the seafood combination and it was crazy and he ate it.

534
00:39:18,788 --> 00:39:25,380
Scott: so Of course, this is his department to do the crazy things with deep-frying.

535
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:34,425
Rym: So he walks over to this place where they deep-fry a whole bunch of stuff and he asks if I bring something to you Will you deep-fry it?

536
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:36,891
Scott: and they said yes, they.

537
00:39:36,951 --> 00:39:38,175
Rym: and he said are you serious?

538
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:41,183
Rym: He said if you pay we will deep-fry it Mm-hmm.

539
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:46,160
Scott: He then was sure there are many health code violations with you bringing food to a restaurant for them to cook.

540
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:50,740
Rym: Well considering that I don't think anyone in Wildwood wears gloves.

541
00:39:51,282 --> 00:39:57,673
Scott: most of them are Europeans making barely minimum wage and Of course, I'm not too worried because it is deep-frying.

542
00:39:57,774 --> 00:39:58,960
Scott: anything that goes in there is dead.

543
00:39:59,888 --> 00:40:09,292
Rym: So then he goes immediately Immediately to the next-door pizzeria Buys a slice of cheese pizza and says to the man pepperoni pizza was it.

544
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:09,693
Scott: Yes.

545
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:10,536
Rym: Oh god.

546
00:40:10,556 --> 00:40:12,060
Rym: I wasn't paying attention.

547
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,743
Rym: No, you weren't.

548
00:40:13,586 --> 00:40:20,560
Rym: and then he says to the guy I am going to go have this deep-fried And we took pictures of like him shaking hands with the pizza guy.

549
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:32,679
Rym: Yes, you definitely want to look at the forum post about this because we have an entire photo archive courtesy of James Yep, and you just look at all the pictures in sequence and it kind of tells the story for you, you know.

550
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:39,404
Rym: So then he takes it back over to the deep-fried place and there's a little bit of debate and the people are like Are you sure?

551
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,034
Rym: and he's like yes bring it on.

552
00:40:41,115 --> 00:40:45,760
Scott: and he was like, you know We had to confirm that yes, they would do this and how much would it cost?

553
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,381
Scott: You know.

554
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:47,928
Scott: and they I think they said four dollars.

555
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:49,696
Scott: in the end was yeah, that was worth it.

556
00:40:49,857 --> 00:40:51,323
Scott: Yeah four dollars That's like free.

557
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:57,603
Rym: So then they cut it up and they deep-fry it in powdered sugar and Funnel cake batter.

558
00:40:57,744 --> 00:41:04,580
Scott: they had to cut the pizza up because it wouldn't all they couldn't get batter on the whole thing at once Because it's a pretty big slice, you know, that's what you get on the shore.

559
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:16,162
Scott: But yeah, they cut up and we had like three or four pieces of deep-fried Pizza slice of pizza covered in what is essentially funnel cake and Powder sugar.

560
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,250
Rym: now they are laughing hysterically the entire time.

561
00:41:19,692 --> 00:41:21,196
Scott: Everyone is laughing hysterically.

562
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:22,680
Scott: The employees are laughing hysterically.

563
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,066
Scott: It's a good time was had by all.

564
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:28,664
Rym: so Pete takes it back over to the guy who sold him the pizza to show that He wasn't bullshitting.

565
00:41:28,725 --> 00:41:29,748
Rym: He was not a shit talker.

566
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:29,949
Rym: Here.

567
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:31,174
Rym: It was the deep-fried pizza.

568
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:31,716
Scott: Yep.

569
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:32,920
Rym: He shook the guy's hand.

570
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,412
Rym: The guy was like you're gonna die.

571
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:39,733
Scott: Yeah And then we went back to the deep-fried place to sit down and eat it.

572
00:41:40,174 --> 00:41:44,126
Rym: now what follows can be described But is best seen in the pictures.

573
00:41:44,387 --> 00:41:49,283
Rym: Yes, because each one of us starting with Pete would take a piece Eat it.

574
00:41:49,765 --> 00:41:53,679
Rym: and then there is the reaction shot to the flavor of this item that we have made.

575
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:58,272
Scott: The only thing I can tell you is something that everyone else seemed to agree on.

576
00:41:58,734 --> 00:42:01,000
Scott: it tastes like a sugary hot pocket.

577
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,920
Rym: Surprisingly, yes, it tasted exactly like one of those hot pockets that you could buy for like middle school lunch and only sugary.

578
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:11,100
Rym: Well because we put powdered sugar on it.

579
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,731
Scott: Well, also the funnel cake is the sugary batter.

580
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:15,900
Scott: if it was a non it was a different batter.

581
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:18,491
Scott: It would have been a hot pocket now in retrospect.

582
00:42:18,551 --> 00:42:20,480
Rym: It was not the best piece of pizza to begin with.

583
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:29,359
Rym: no, it really wasn't and we probably could have done better, but The pictures of Pete eating it are some of the funniest things I've seen in a long time.

584
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,489
Scott: Pictures of everyone eating it are hilarious.

585
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:35,020
Rym: I mean for Pete there's a picture of him holding the slice up.

586
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,498
Rym: I like about to take a bite out of it.

587
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:42,940
Rym: Then there's a picture of him looking down like laughing but not able to quite deal with what is in his mouth.

588
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:49,214
Rym: Then there's a picture of him looking far more defeated as he tastes the full flavor of this item.

589
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:53,151
Rym: I Look like I'm about to vomit.

590
00:42:53,232 --> 00:43:07,229
Scott: I have this look of like what if you Ever go somewhere that has a deep fryer and funnel cake batter and they're looking like this cool employees there Try to get them to deep-fry weird shit.

591
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,815
Scott: Yeah, it's worth it.

592
00:43:08,835 --> 00:43:09,959
Rym: They probably will do it.

593
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:20,614
Scott: It's a lot of fun and you know, their jobs are boring and kind of unexciting and if you you know It'll be exciting for you and exciting for them and it just makes the world a better place.

594
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:26,676
Rym: now the funniest and scariest Part of this whole thing is that we as a group ate the entire goddamn thing.

595
00:43:26,736 --> 00:43:27,680
Scott: There were a lot of us.

596
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:33,479
Scott: I think that we had a small bit left over that we gave to the employees while we as a group ate most of it.

597
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,853
Rym: Pete ate More than he should have.

598
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:37,377
Scott: he did.

599
00:43:37,437 --> 00:43:42,577
Rym: indeed He ate an entire piece all the way through and he had parts of all the other pieces.

600
00:43:42,597 --> 00:43:47,056
Rym: Yeah Yeah, I had like two bites now for the rest of the night.

601
00:43:47,076 --> 00:43:55,720
Rym: about an hour later Pete turns to me says something like My stomach has decided that what we just did was not the best idea and like know what you did was not the best idea.

602
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,459
Scott: I didn't eat enough of it to make it bad.

603
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:00,720
Rym: I ate two bites of it and my stomach was a little grumbly.

604
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,068
Rym: My stomach said what the fuck did you just put in me?

605
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:08,245
Rym: Good God god damn got damn motherfucking damn Fried funnel cake on a pizza.

606
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:09,648
Rym: It's not a goddamn thing.

607
00:44:09,668 --> 00:44:10,370
Rym: You can do about it.

608
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:11,573
Scott: Okay kind of pizza.

609
00:44:11,634 --> 00:44:15,367
Rym: Hope I Can't describe this any better.

610
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:17,037
Rym: You really need to go see these pictures.

611
00:44:17,077 --> 00:44:21,240
Rym: They're Hilarious absolutely fantastic.

612
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,186
Rym: Now the moral of the story.

613
00:44:23,206 --> 00:44:28,423
Rym: because we're drawing this Thursday episode to a close the last episode of room will not have a pop Filter.

614
00:44:28,804 --> 00:44:32,358
Rym: you won't have to put up with my popping peas all over the podcast anymore.

615
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:40,038
Rym: penis You know, I really honestly did not expect you Scott Rubin to say the word penis.

616
00:44:40,439 --> 00:44:49,629
Rym: really I mean of all the times you've said that word This was not the moment, you know the moment when we're saying words that begin with the letter P That you would in fact say the word penis.

617
00:44:49,909 --> 00:44:52,257
Rym: really nah, nah, really?

618
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:53,100
Rym: Yeah, really?

619
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:59,241
Rym: But the moral of this story is that any time you were bored Anytime.

620
00:44:59,282 --> 00:45:05,071
Rym: you're in a place either with people you find uninteresting or a place that you don't think can entertain you.

621
00:45:05,091 --> 00:45:18,040
Rym: I Know there is no place on this earth where you cannot entertain yourself in some way by either hacking or pleasuring yourself.

622
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:26,705
Scott: Yeah, seriously if I was in solitary in a prison I could just I'll just whack it For days.

623
00:45:26,866 --> 00:45:27,810
Scott: who's gonna stop me?

624
00:45:28,453 --> 00:45:29,880
Rym: Yeah, you know, there's a story about that.

625
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,552
Rym: We're not gonna tell because it could get both of us in trouble.

626
00:45:32,572 --> 00:45:37,274
Rym: Oh, right, right Suffice to say.

627
00:45:38,242 --> 00:45:40,692
Rym: Hacking does not apply to computers and computers alone.

628
00:45:40,973 --> 00:45:42,500

629
00:45:42,902 --> 00:45:45,216

00:45:45,437 --> 00:45:45,800
Rym: Awesome.

631
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,226
Scott: Well anything awesome that is hacking.

Rym: Well, yes.

633
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:53,659
Scott: Yeah, I mean you can do awesome things that are not hacking such as heroic deeds.

634
00:45:53,679 --> 00:46:03,020
Scott: and Now if you hack in order to do heroic deed plus plus oh man Heroic hacking is the best is the most awesome thing you can possibly do.

635
00:46:03,663 --> 00:46:07,300
Scott: I don't think you can possibly be more awesome than hacking heroically.

636
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:09,585
Scott: All right, that's about it.

00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,171
