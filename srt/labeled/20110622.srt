1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,247
Rym: It's Wednesday June 22nd.

2
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:11,990
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,139
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight in the year 2011 We talk about anime that we have not seen.

4
00:00:18,706 --> 00:00:29,668
Rym: opposite wise Let's do this Awkwardly constructed episode title.

5
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:35,273
Rym: I think you could have come with a better title than I could have but I didn't come up with one And it already started saying the thing.

6
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:42,130
Scott: so yeah Just go back and redo it later, and then this part will make no sense Which is I don't know if I want to do that or not.

7
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,240
Rym: I think it's a good meta joke either way anyway.

8
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:56,480
Rym: So you know it's really upsetting a lot of things the fact that you know the Patriot Act got extended The wars in the world poverty obesity yeah sure anyway.

9
00:00:56,922 --> 00:01:00,800
Scott: So this New York Asian film festival is gonna be coming to New York again.

10
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:05,950
Scott: Oh, and I think there's one thing that we really wanted as it does every year And they're gonna show something.

11
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:10,500
Scott: that is you know last year There was some cool stuff that I wanted to see like there was was a crazy kaiju thing.

12
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,327
Scott: Oh, yeah, that was playing it like midnight or something.

13
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:18,843
Scott: It was like it was like kappa death kappa or something like that Something like.

14
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:23,700
Rym: I don't wanted to see that but it was like the kind of thing we would usually go to see it like the 11 o'clock showing at Otakon.

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:30,933
Scott: It was like a midnight showing and I think Scott Johnson people were over for some reason, but anyway Well, we didn't go see it, but I so this year.

16
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:37,373
Scott: They're showing Basically there's a new anime version of Tezuka's Buddha, or is it live-action.

17
00:01:37,414 --> 00:01:38,176
Scott: It doesn't matter.

18
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:39,560
Scott: I want to see that so bad.

19
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,514
Rym: I'm pretty sure it's animated either way.

20
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:54,620
Scott: They're showing it Thursday night and Sunday night Matt lining up right with ConnectiCon which also lines right up with that my little pony convention.

21
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:58,532
Scott: We could go see it Thursday night, and then leave for ConnectiCon mutley.

22
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:01,020
Rym: Yeah, we could but we have responsibilities at the con.

23
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:02,988
Scott: But it's at 630 so it's actually.

24
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,038
Scott: it's not late Thursday night, so we could go watch it.

25
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:09,958
Rym: 637 All right, so we get on the road at like 9. we get to the kind of like 11 all right all right.

26
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:11,345
Scott: What's wrong with that?

27
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:13,658
Rym: a lot of people check in on Thursday stuff to do?

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,951
Rym: Anyway, yeah, that's the trouble of having responsibilities.

29
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:19,653
Scott: That's all right.

30
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:20,255
Scott: Well.

31
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:24,798
Scott: It'll definitely be something We can see at some point in the future by hook or crook.

32
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:28,580
Scott: But if you are you know I guess this normally would be met a moment.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,233
Scott: But whatever, New York Asian film festival 2011 check it out.

34
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:33,678
Scott: There's a lot of good stuff to see.

35
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:36,169
Scott: yeah Kung-fu's etc.

36
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,280
Rym: so I heard up Spider-Man's dead.

37
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,228
Scott: Hey, Spider-Man's not real.

38
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,032
Scott: so how can he be dead?

39
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:43,460
Rym: well in the comic universe?

40
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,080
Rym: Well, I thought parker who was Spider-Man Was killed by some but that's only ultimate Spider-Man not regular spider-Man.

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,599
Rym: I didn't realize until I read this article that there was a difference because the guy writing the article was like.

42
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,334
Rym: I thought they were all in the same stupid universe.

43
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:04,720
Rym: then this guy's like oh But in this universe if you die you're really dead and in the other universes you can come back.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,492
Rym: So this is the real deal.

45
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:08,987
Scott: Spider-Man dead What I don't know.

46
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:09,289
Scott: who's right?

47
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,560
Scott: basically it for people who don't know right?

48
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:23,540
Scott: Marvel comics Recognized that there was a problem that people who had not been reading Spider-Man or x-men or whatever for a hundred years had a hard Time getting into these Spider-Man x-men and superhero comics.

49
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:26,672
Scott: You know that have been going on since the 60s and the 70s.

50
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:30,715
Scott: so they made some years ago Actually a very long time ago already.

51
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:32,825
Scott: you know Many many years ago.

52
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:40,340
Scott: They made ultimate Spider-Man ultimate x-men ultimate avengers I'll you know actually was called ultimates as opposed to ultimate avengers.

53
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,429
Scott: They made a whole bunch of ultimate ultimate fantastic four right.

54
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,074
Scott: and this is these comics.

55
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:46,960
Scott: these ultimate comics were in their own universe.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,823
Scott: So it's like they made a new universe that nothing to do at all with the old universe and all those comics had the word ultimate on the top.

57
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:56,355
Scott: so you could just read those and not worry about anything else.

58
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:58,495
Scott: and if you start at the beginning you'd be all good.

59
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:11,360
Scott: and You know if you can still easily go and acquire all the trades of all those comics and read them from the beginning And it won't be too expensive or take you that long and you won't miss anything, and there's only a couple crossovers

60
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:16,089
Rym: And they only cross over issues in spider-man.

61
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,536
Scott: yeah, they only cross over with themselves right.

62
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:19,720
Scott: so it's not really that big a deal.

63
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,478
Scott: It's all contained in like this little bubble.

64
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:26,500
Scott: So it you know, but the problem was is that they kept that going for so long.

65
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:34,318
Scott: It was actually kind of popular that It eventually itself became too long and too big and and too difficult for people to get into.

66
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:40,620
Rym: so now I've decided that the big it's not comics It's everything nerds like worlds where they can Gandalf girth.

67
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:48,949
Rym: And they like there to be continuity in things like if they read a Star Wars comic And it lines up good enough with the Star Wars movies.

68
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:49,631
Rym: They love that shit.

69
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:51,116
Rym: Yeah, and I'm no exception.

70
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:51,939
Rym: I like things like that.

71
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:54,608
Rym: Comics like this just take it too far.

72
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:58,185
Rym: you got to leave a lot more gaps and not I don't know I feel like too much.

73
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:02,140
Rym: continuity Hurts all but the hardest of the hardcore nerd.

74
00:05:02,582 --> 00:05:08,685
Scott: See the problem isn't necessarily the world building or You know such like that.

75
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:12,358
Scott: the problem is the linearity and the serial ness of it.

76
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:15,520
Scott: right for example I could create a world pick a fantasy world forgotten around.

77
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:17,445
Scott: Perfect example.

78
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:21,196
Scott: right I can tell you a story in forgotten realms about drizzet.

79
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:22,660
Scott: He was very popular.

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,727
Rym: Yeah, we pretty much know everything did.

81
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:26,593
Rym: I can tell you know who drizzed was?

82
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:28,319
Scott: he was some guy with two swords, right?

83
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,592
Rym: I What race was he?

84
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,828
Scott: I'm gonna guess drow all right.

85
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,517
Rym: Oh, you got that really oh shit.

86
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,893
Rym: Yeah Yeah, was he a good guy or a bad guy?

87
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:41,419
Scott: I'm gonna guess bad guy.

88
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:45,746
Scott: It's complicated actually okay sure anyway I only know is that he's.

89
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:48,440
Rym: you have no idea who artemis and troy is though not a clue.

90
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,059
Scott: Yeah, I can also tell you with another story about el minster.

91
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,652
Scott: All I know about him is he's like the most powerful wizard there was.

92
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:58,100
Rym: ah you know what I learned from elements like Merlin equivalent.

93
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,640
Rym: You know what I learned from el minster when he was a girl.

94
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:07,806
Rym: I learned a lot about what that author thought girls felt like when they had sex, okay, and From that same author.

95
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,937
Rym: I learned a lot about what turns elves on.

96
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:11,846
Scott: right now These are both in the same universe.

97
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,755
Scott: if you're a nerd you're gonna love these things right?

98
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:19,673
Scott: if you're that kind of nerd But you don't have to read the drizz story to also read the el minster story.

99
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:22,240
Scott: They don't go in order necessarily true, right?

100
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:22,922
Scott: They're not like.

101
00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:28,320
Scott: it's not like part one drizz part to a minster, but I think it's not a serial tale.

102
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:36,879
Rym: It's a bunch of separate tales all in the same world part of that Very large world and they didn't write that many stories inside of it.

103
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:43,240
Rym: They then and the word the stories they did write were broad and spread out across all these different places though Some of them were very linear.

104
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:55,740
Scott: There was like one series of like eight books But all went together and another set of books that also kind of anyway But the Forgotten Realms is more like a jigsaw puzzle and you can get each piece and sort of make out what's going on.

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,474
Rym: You know that I think jigsaw puzzles are better for the nerds in the long run.

106
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:02,700
Rym: Of course the line of spider-man

107
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:13,700
Scott: Yes, you know what Marvel has is they basically have one long reel of film and they give it to you in pieces And you it only goes in one order and if you're missing a piece of the film, you can't play the movie.

108
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:17,680
Scott: You know, I mean sure there are plenty of times where they don't do that, you know.

109
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,360
Scott: It's sort of like they have a jigsaw puzzle and film together sort of right like I read.

110
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,359
Scott: You know a bunch of Marvel cosmic stuff like all the you know annihilations, but every time I'm making the jigsaw puzzle There's all these missing Wolverine pieces.

111
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,145
Scott: Every piece has Wolverine on it.

112
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:33,991
Scott: Wolverines on every single piece.

113
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:36,840
Scott: It's either a claw or the horn on his hat thingy.

114
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,748
Scott: You know something he's on every piece.

115
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:47,727
Rym: team a will be Psylocke and Wolverine team be Cyclops and Wolverine team Just Wolverine, yeah, but so yeah, so they're.

116
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:54,303
Scott: they're killing ultimate spider-man, which I think they're sort of killing off ultimate Everything.

117
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:57,497
Scott: from what I can tell I think they're trying to end the ultimate stuff.

118
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:58,200
Scott: I could be wrong.

119
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,867
Scott: Well from what I read that's the door.

120
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:03,040
Rym: All right, there's already going to be another ultimate spider-man.

121
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,874
Rym: It's just not gonna be Peter Parker cuz he's dead.

122
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:08,614
Scott: Okay, I Thought that there I guess they're not ending ultimate everything.

123
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:09,440
Rym: as far as I can tell.

124
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:17,176
Rym: I mean this is I have not read a Marvel comic since The end of the executioner's song and x-men.

125
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:21,330
Scott: didn't you read Many for the show like x-men forever.

126
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,131
Rym: Oh, yeah, I've read all those like individual bits here and there But I have not like continued to read anything.

127
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:26,533
Rym: I don't know.

128
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:27,980
Rym: I don't know the continuity.

129
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:34,275
Scott: I you know, I bought you know, I stopped sort of when they you know, they that cosmic stuff I just talked about sort of ended.

130
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:38,614
Rym: ish I started with the end of excuse your song going back and read that whole like arc.

131
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:41,708
Rym: and then I read I kept reading from There for a little and I just kind of give up.

132
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:42,131
Scott: Yeah.

133
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:46,251
Scott: Oh No, well, so yeah the killer.

134
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,600
Scott: I wonder if they will actually bring him back or not.

135
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:54,317
Scott: I will bet you because it's ultimate that they won't for quite a long time, but they will eventually.

136
00:08:54,397 --> 00:08:56,386
Scott: but it's like Captain America Who got brought back?

137
00:08:56,729 --> 00:09:05,626
Rym: Oh in the very least I will bet you this I'll bet you $100 that within three years Peter Parker will reappear in something that isn't a flashback But it has to be in ultimate spider-man.

138
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,669
Rym: Yeah ultimate spider-man.

139
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,100
Rym: Yeah, they'll probably go back in time and like talk to him about something.

140
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:10,949
Scott: They do that.

141
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:12,020
Scott: That's another thing, right?

142
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,680
Scott: It's like a lot of characters die and even though they're still dead They find some way to manage to put them in a story even when they're dead.

143
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,614
Rym: Just go back in time and kidnap right before they die and bring him into the future.

144
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:24,636
Rym: Who knows anyway Didn't I do that to chrono?

145
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,954
Scott: anyway, so We all know about a lot of virtual idols like Hatsune Miku and such right?

146
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:32,077
Scott: That's that's sort of old news.

147
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:32,739
Rym: It's not Ruben.

148
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:41,105
Scott: Yeah, that's old news to us by now, even though it's news to the rest of the world, but check this out All right, so, you know What are their names?

149
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:42,293
Scott: girls generation, right?

150
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:43,420
Scott: GGG, right?

151
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,027
Scott: We talked about them on the show before.

152
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,154
Scott: song never got stuck in my head.

153
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:47,180
Scott: You didn't listen to it enough.

154
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:49,366
Rym: Oh, yeah, you should very pointedly.

155
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:50,028
Scott: It's a good song.

156
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:53,539
Scott: It's okay kind of anyway, it's a good song for sticking in heads.

157
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:58,733
Scott: So, you know over in Japan Korea, I don't know about China.

158
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,720
Scott: They have you know, these these girl idol groups.

159
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,051
Scott: It's like a big team like morning moves.

160
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:05,000
Scott: Yeah, it's like we can't just have Britney Spears.

161
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:11,007
Scott: We got to have 20 Britney Spears in a in a group and Like something different.

162
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:12,331
Scott: So no matter who you are.

163
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:13,776
Scott: One of them will be your favorite one.

164
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:16,010
Rym: That's the surly one That's the bubbly one.

165
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,220
Rym: That's the strange one.

166
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,247
Scott: And instead of sexy one instead of having you know one person do a bunch of commercials.

167
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,159
Scott: we can have them all doing all the commercials all the time because it's so.

168
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:37,399
Scott: so AKB 48 is one of those groups very popular especially among the nerds and they recently released a commercial for For a sort of candy called ice no me sweet.

169
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:41,873
Scott: and In this commercial was a new member of the group named.

170
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,419
Scott: I me a Gucci.

171
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:49,297
Scott: what they did not tell you until just now is that this I am.

172
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:51,824
Scott: II Gucci is Not a real person.

173
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:57,100
Scott: It looked like a real person in the commercial and sounded like a real person not like Hatsune Miku Which is obviously a digital person.

174
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,043
Rym: Yeah well I read a number.

175
00:10:58,063 --> 00:10:59,791
Rym: I was poking around about this because I didn't.

176
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:04,630
Rym: I wasn't aware until Scott pointed it out and It seems like a lot of nerds had suspicions.

177
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,393
Rym: They're like, wait a minute.

178
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,180
Rym: I can't find any info on this girl.

179
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:12,100
Scott: Yeah, and they sort of put some fake info out there about her on you know, their website like, you know.

180
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:15,522
Scott: oh she you know did a photo shoot and Right.

181
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,250
Scott: They made like a fake biography to try to convince you.

182
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:19,373
Scott: This is a real person.

183
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:20,456
Scott: I get hiccups.

184
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:21,198
Rym: Good job.

185
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:30,504
Scott: And so, you know people were like But they it looked like a real person and it was in it and then they finally came out with it like nope It's not a real person.

186
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:34,980
Scott: They took different visual aspects of many different members of the group.

187
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:45,620
Scott: So they took like one girl's eyes and one girl's hair and one girl's you know Lips and one girl and they digitally pasted them all together to make a new person that did not really exist.

188
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:55,720
Scott: I predict they had one of their sort of you know research students Which is like one of the you know B team like girl who works for them and is training to become a real member.

189
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:57,230
Scott: But isn't they had her do the voice?

190
00:11:57,331 --> 00:11:58,680
Rym: That would be a good plot for an anime.

191
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:06,593
Scott: Yeah, and so they made this fake person for this commercial Which is pretty cool two predictions from Rym.

192
00:12:06,854 --> 00:12:08,400
Rym: one, you know what our future is now.

193
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:10,627
Rym: It's not gonna be the Terminator 2 apocalypse.

194
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,474
Rym: It's Macross Plus, of course.

195
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:15,727
Rym: Yeah, and two Currently, what do they do?

196
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:18,620
Rym: They used to you know, we have the one idol like a Megumi or an I you me.

197
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:22,779
Rym: But then you have the idol team, you know one idol for every kind of person.

198
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:30,840
Rym: The real future now is going to be the virtual person where it detects who's watching and makes the perfect idol for that one person.

199
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:35,334
Rym: Oh shit, so everyone sees their perfect idealized idol.

200
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,360
Scott: That is some forward fucking thinking right there.

201
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:40,020
Scott: Yeah, yeah, you get points for that one because that's gonna happen.

202
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,722
Scott: That is so gonna happen like it knows what your tastes are and of all the idols it combines all of your favorite aspects of Each one.

203
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,087
Scott: so you're watching TV.

204
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:49,592
Scott: I see something different from what you see.

205
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:51,720
Rym: Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna be seeing some Rainbow Dash.

206
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,639
Scott: Okay But yeah, that's that's pretty fucked up right there.

207
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:04,978
Rym: So I have one more little news because Emily pointed this out to me and she would have totally gone forward if it was more convenient.

208
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:15,660
Rym: Makoto shinkai studio is recruiting a very specific type of intern Or the fall unpaid and all that you got to get to the studio yourself.

209
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,062
Scott: I wonder what?

210
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:19,739
Scott: the laws of an unpaid orange pad probably much more lax than they are here.

211
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,740
Scott: The thing is they're not followed here at all.

212
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,520
Rym: I imagine in Japan you're given some sort of medal for if you hire the most people and pay them the least.

213
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:35,403
Rym: So specifically they're looking for young interns to do Makoto shinkai Background art.

214
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:38,554
Scott: so but they would to do anything like his backgrounds.

215
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:40,460
Scott: You would need to hire God of interns.

216
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:41,487
Rym: I guess they're looking.

217
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:46,352
Scott: or the quality is gonna go way down Or they're gonna whip them until they do.

218
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,100
Rym: maybe they're trying to make more people.

219
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,760
Rym: They're just gonna put them in front of sad videos of puppies and just wait until they start crying and then make them draw.

220
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,576
Scott: listen, if you really like clouds, this is a job for you.

221
00:13:56,596 --> 00:14:00,364
Rym: or possibly Cherry blossoms.

222
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:01,812
Scott: Yeah clouds though.

223
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:03,160
Rym: Mostly cloud blossoms.

224
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:05,684
Scott: It's be hard trains.

225
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,132
Scott: It's gonna be real hard power lines for trains.

226
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,820
Rym: Sure with clouds in the background always class.

227
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:19,109
Rym: So things of the day, what do you got for me?

228
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:27,706
Scott: So, I'm pretty sure I used this before but I Extensively searched and may have failed at finding when I used this before.

229
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:28,328
Scott: so I'm using it.

230
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:31,515
Scott: Fuck you I don't know if you've heard of this.

231
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:32,558
Scott: It's called.

232
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:33,881
Scott: you definitely heard of it.

233
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:35,405
Scott: Mama Shiva.

234
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:41,804
Scott: It is dogs That are also beans Basically, what is foreign you use that.

235
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,813
Scott: I also would have That.

236
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:48,789
Rym: maybe we had a party and you used it for our crew But you did not ever put it on the show.

237
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:50,737
Scott: I don't know but the I was.

238
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:53,086
Scott: I found out about it from our crew at a party.

239
00:14:53,407 --> 00:15:01,147
Scott: So anyway Mama Shiva is these bean dogs and basically there's this YouTube TV episodes which are like incredibly short.

240
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:05,084
Scott: There's books This cut there's all kinds of you know, this you can buy.

241
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:06,210
Scott: you can buy plushies.

242
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:08,216
Scott: It's a whole Empire sort of the same way.

243
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:10,784
Scott: moyashi Mon was an empire of you know stuff.

244
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:17,150
Scott: and basically the shtick is this Somebody's sitting around and maybe they're doing something and a mama shiba appears.

245
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,140
Scott: It's a bean that looks like a dog and there's all different.

246
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:27,784
Scott: There's one for every kind of bean and then It says some sort of weird fact that may or may not be true.

247
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:29,429
Scott: That is just like what the fuck.

248
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:32,656
Scott: and Then it goes mama Shiva and that's it.

249
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:36,550
Rym: That is definitely a formula for success is a formula for success.

250
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:42,238
Scott: the official mama shiba website says What exactly is mama shiba?

251
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:44,890
Scott: they're not quite a bean nor a dog but rather a hybrid of both.

252
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,390
Scott: They love to appear out of nowhere and offer random bits of trivia whether you asked for it or not.

253
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:51,510
Scott: That is pretty much sums it up entirely.

254
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,114
Scott: It's pretty funny.

255
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:53,718
Scott: I like it.

256
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,050
Scott: if I've used it before I don't give a shit.

257
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,344
Scott: There's nothing no other good things of the day to use that aren't just college humor.

258
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:03,791
Scott: So this is what you get Repeat for a long time like.

259
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:10,545
Rym: I would just pick like some random funny video the kind of thing that when it's like 1130 and one of our parties is winding down.

260
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:11,550
Rym: There's like three people left.

261
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:17,410
Rym: We always end up in front of the TV watching random internet shit, usually going through the things of the day.

262
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:21,442
Rym: But recently we've been using a lot of more newsy kind of things the day like.

Scott: cuz the Creative Commons.

339
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,440
Rym: Yeah, pretty much everything we do is Creative Commons.

340
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:17,902
Scott: That's right.

341
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,670
Scott: So so but that's all you.

342
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:21,876
Rym: So a while ago some time ago.

343
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:26,249
Rym: I was watching way more anime than Scott and now that was a long time ago.

344
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:27,835
Rym: now We're a few years ago.

345
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:28,438
Rym: Now.

346
00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:31,430
Rym: We're pretty much in the exact opposite situation.

347
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:37,299
Scott: Well, actually not anymore because I sort of I watched a fuck ton of anime in the past few months and in the past one Month or so.

348
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:38,110
Scott: I stopped watching.

349
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:40,059
Rym: I think what happened to you is you were.

350
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,410
Rym: you're like a spaceship that got caught in a gravity.

351
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,960
Rym: Well of things like Hajime no Ippo where it pulls you in.

352
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,370
Rym: you gotta watch the whole thing and then you catapult out of it.

353
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:50,409
Scott: Yep, I mean I would if I could get a hold of it.

354
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:56,170
Scott: I would watch Queen millennia But I can't seem to find all the episodes with subtitles so I can't get pulled into it.

355
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,150
Rym: Yep, and I've been working on a lot of stuff where I've also been working on a lot of stuff.

356
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:02,630
Rym: I'm doing stuff and I want to watch anime or something.

357
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:07,330
Rym: But I want something I can watch kind of not with the full attention like not looking directly at the screen.

358
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,081
Scott: Also a pony sort of ruined everything.

359
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,470
Rym: Yeah ponies kind of got in the way.

360
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:15,505
Rym: Yeah, so we're gonna both talk about anime that we know the other person hasn't seen.

361
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,158
Scott: also comics also some comics You know.

362
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,329
Scott: it's pretty much like hey This is gonna be like a flurry of geek bites of things that I watched and Rym didn't watch and vice versa.

363
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,886
Rym: sir I'll start because we don't review a lot of recent anime lately, and I want to rectify that.

364
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:34,352
Rym: so I've been watching three anime Simultaneously.

365
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:42,358
Rym: oh shit because as you all know madhouse and Marvel teamed up to make Four anime based on Marvel properties.

366
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:43,943
Scott: really I didn't.

367
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:46,430
Scott: wow really I guess I did sort of know.

368
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:52,540
Scott: It's like I knew it, but I sort of also forgot about it And it sort of felt like something that was in the future.

369
00:20:52,761 --> 00:21:01,233
Rym: There's there's a madhouse Wolverine X-men separate from Wolverine Iron Man, and I think blade is the one that is now yet Or I haven't seen.

370
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,465
Rym: I don't really care about because I don't really care about blade.

371
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:10,553
Rym: Yeah, okay, so I've watched a few episodes of all of them and the animation is Fantastic.

372
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:10,794
Rym: well,

373
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:13,230
Scott: I imagine they put a ton of monies into it

374
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:25,495
Rym: And it looks great like rent aro did the pilot for I think the x-men one and a lot of big people you know it's Like all the different teams at madhouse are on this and it's looking pretty great, so the Iron Man one I think has the most potential,

375
00:21:26,097 --> 00:21:27,100
Scott: but I hate Iron Man.

376
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,150
Rym: Yeah, you know what Iron Man is a gigantic douche.

377
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,390
Scott: I know that's why I hate Iron Man, and it's great.

378
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:40,589
Rym: No, no because in Japan he gets interviewed like in one of them I think the first episode and they're like so uh he's like how can I be more popular with the Japanese people?

379
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:45,788
Rym: they don't seem To like me that much and the reporters like well, you could stop being such a douche.

380
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:50,604
Rym: basically She's like you could be more humble, and he's like yeah, that's really outside of my abilities.

381
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:51,909
Rym: you ask too much.

382
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:57,162
Rym: I Feel like to not spoil anything.

383
00:21:57,503 --> 00:21:59,630
Rym: It's about a dude with a power suit.

384
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:02,428
Rym: Yeah, I feel like Japan could not cock that up.

385
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:08,870
Rym: Yeah It's pretty much their specialty and the plot seems to be kind of giant robo e Iron Man or Ava.

386
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:19,949
Rym: Iron Man made a production model of the Iron Man suit and they got a bunch of pilots from Japan and other places to Be Iron Man so he can retire from being Iron Man and just be a guy again.

387
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:29,730
Rym: Yeah And the suit goes crazy and kills all the pilots and he has to get in the prototype Iron Man suit and save the day Me and play gods.

388
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:31,095
Rym: It's pretty great.

389
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:32,460
Scott: It's it's caveman.

390
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,022
Scott: science fiction.

391
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:39,664
Rym: x-men is pretty much just Imagine the the x-men cartoon we knew and loved only done by madhouse.

392
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,049
Rym: Okay, it's great.

393
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:44,604
Rym: All the characters look.

394
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:45,510
Rym: they're very like.

395
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:51,399
Rym: I don't know the 90s like the cut the style of x-men that we like and the Animation is great kind of thick line, but I like it.

396
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,166
Rym: the fighting is super awesome.

397
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:53,950
Rym: It's a good show.

398
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:55,516
Scott: Oh, yes, that's something else.

399
00:22:55,556 --> 00:22:57,704
Scott: You know, I don't see too often is actual fighting.

400
00:22:57,745 --> 00:22:59,070
Scott: That's fun to watch.

401
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:05,775
Rym: It's fun to watch fighting in the same way that a lot of old like a birdie the mighty had similar Like even in Hajime no Ippo.

402
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:15,270
Scott: the fighting, you know is fun not because intense and very rarely is the animation of the fighting something That's other than like repeat of a special move.

403
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:21,090
Scott: This to the North Star fighting is fun to watch only because only because the dude fucking explodes all over the place.

404
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:23,360
Scott: Yeah, it's not animated in a cowboy bebop.

405
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:24,787
Rym: No, it is not the first fight.

406
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:29,789
Scott: a cowboy bebop I think is like, you know, that's one of my favorite fights in anything ever as the first lesson.

407
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:40,778
Scott: Dead wife kick in iron monk I know but I'm talking about animated fight choreography cowboy bebop episode one fight outside The cantina is pretty much number one.

408
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,385
Rym: I think it's specifically the kick and the table like.

409
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:45,251
Rym: that part right there got me Yep.

410
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:49,866
Rym: Anyway, uh, the Wolverine one is the only one that sucks.

411
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:50,890
Scott: Oh, it actually sucks.

412
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:52,115
Scott: So it's not like.

413
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:53,240
Scott: oh shit is Wolverine.

414
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,610
Rym: So in the regular x-men, it's oh shit is Wolverine.

415
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,370
Rym: Wolverine is always hunched with his arms out and the blades he's like.

416
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:14,596
Rym: And if they didn't tell you that the Wolverine anime is Wolverine and if the fan sub didn't keep using bub, even though I don't hear anyone actually saying bub You would not know it's Wolverine.

417
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:20,052
Rym: It is unless you knew all the plot of Wolverine and you recognize the plot Mm-hmm.

418
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:26,890
Rym: It's basically the shonen looking guy who happens to be invincible and have claws is in Japan fucking shit up.

419
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:32,350
Scott: It's just really well, that's that's interesting cuz it's like Iron Man never really went to Japan as far as I know.

420
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,010
Scott: So yeah, all the places are men don't go to Japan that often but Wolverine is all about Japan.

421
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:43,611
Rym: He's a huge Japan part of the Wolverine in Japan plot, except he's all kind of be shown in Uh-huh.

422
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:44,955
Rym: He's not nearly gruff enough.

423
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:49,689
Scott: Alrighty, and the thing is when he was in Japan, that was the most gruff ist.

424
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,870
Scott: I know that he was comics wise.

425
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:53,375
Scott: So that's it.

426
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:53,877
Rym: So I was.

427
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:57,574
Rym: I basically I watched one episode of that and gave up on it But the regular x-men one.

428
00:24:57,855 --> 00:25:02,513
Rym: it's like they took all his gruff out of Wolverine and put it all into the x-men anime Mm-hmm.

429
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:03,517
Scott: All right.

430
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:04,019
Scott: Let's see what.

431
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:13,251
Scott: I watched a ton of animes, but most of them were oh And also they're like one show that you went all the fuck way through and a lot of them are Like.

432
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:26,510
Scott: I see I saw so many lazy Matsumoto's like space battleship Yamato all of Captain Harlock all of Galaxy Express all Galaxy Railways all Space Symphony may tell right many of these are shows that I've seen several episodes of but just didn't finish.

433
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:28,377
Rym: Yeah, I mean Galaxy Express.

434
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:30,405
Rym: I got like 40 in and then I just haven't.

435
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:31,590
Rym: I got to watch more.

436
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:35,850
Scott: Alright, so I think the one I want to talk about those I wanna talk about Galaxy Railways, right?

437
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,570
Scott: Cuz that's that's newer and it's uh, you can just get like all the DVDs in a whole bunch.

438
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,468
Scott: I think it might even be on Netflix or something, right?

439
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:47,930
Scott: So the deal with Galaxy Railways is basically when you're watching Galaxy Express, right?

440
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:54,030
Scott: Sometimes it'll be like the Galaxy Railways will have to enforce the law of the trains.

441
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:58,270
Scott: Yeah, and the rules of the trains basically change episode to episode to serve the plot.

442
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,421
Scott: But they're always jerks like the like.

443
00:26:01,622 --> 00:26:05,580
Scott: you can't get out of train without a ticket except We'll make a special exception for main characters.

444
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:07,430
Rym: you mess with our train will kill you all.

445
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:11,470
Scott: Yeah, if you fuck with the train, we'll just blow your brains out and all these sorts of things.

446
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:15,230
Scott: So Galaxy Railways is like two separate TV series, right?

447
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:23,785
Scott: It's a season one and a season two and basically It follows the story of this kid whose dad works for the Galaxy Railways and his dad get.

448
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:28,118
Scott: his dad is like the best pilot Ever the best, you know train captain.

449
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,362
Rym: I was gonna say pilot.

450
00:26:29,402 --> 00:26:34,933
Scott: Yeah train captain engineer, whatever it is right, and basically his dad is He.

451
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,478
Scott: his dad rides the train.

452
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:38,545
Scott: that is like the defense train, right?

453
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:38,966
Scott: It's not.

454
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:46,189
Scott: it's not a passenger train It's the train that goes out when another trains in trouble to save it from whatever horrible secret of space Is attacking it this week?

455
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:52,210
Scott: So his dad dies and this kid grows up and then tries to get the same job as his dad, right?

456
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,670
Scott: So he goes to work for the train and of course it makes us.

457
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,616
Scott: Oh, no, and his mom is all upset.

458
00:26:58,238 --> 00:27:13,010
Scott: and the story follows this, you know, both seasons follow this kid who grows up obviously, you know working in the Galaxy Railways on the defense train and It's sort of like, you know the quality of it.

459
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,026
Scott: You know some of the episodes are episodic Galaxy Express style, right?

460
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:24,090
Scott: It's like this episode They have to go and there's some weird thing happening on this planet and they go and they rescue a train and this episodic stuff.

461
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:32,983
Scott: But there's also a plot that sort of also, you know goes on not only development of the characters But also like ooh, there's a secret of the Galaxy Railways.

462
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:33,685
Scott: What is it?

463
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:34,809
Scott: Someone's up to no good.

464
00:27:35,374 --> 00:27:36,424
Scott: Will you uncover this?

465
00:27:36,465 --> 00:27:36,889
Scott: no goodness?

466
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:48,778
Scott: You know and it has to do with like oh the Galaxy Railways themselves the technology that makes them work is tearing a hole in space and Disrupting this other universe and that other universe.

467
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,630
Scott: who wants to attack the Galaxy Railways and someone's covering it up?

468
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,168
Scott: And there's something along those lines.

469
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:56,567
Rym: How Matsumoto-ey is it?

470
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,336
Scott: It's kind of Matsumoto-ey, right?

471
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:00,380
Scott: It's like half right?

472
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,692
Scott: It's like half Matsumoto half modern, you know I Enjoyed it.

473
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:10,489
Scott: I wouldn't say it's like the greatest show ever of all time, but it's definitely like, you know, it's like a b-plus show.

474
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:22,750
Scott: You know the second season like, you know sort of goes, you know in a like the first season has sort of an end But the second season builds up to a more real ish and that like puts a nail in everything.

475
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:25,279
Scott: But the second season has like different characters.

476
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,627
Scott: they bring in, you know, and all that kind of stuff that you know Usually happens in the second season.

477
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:36,895
Scott: Yeah So it's like if you're really attached to this stuff in the first season you feel a little bit detached in the second season because these characters you care less about.

478
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:40,147
Scott: there's also an OAV that goes between the two seasons.

479
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:56,956
Scott: that Basically is a crossover between Galaxy Express and Galaxy Railways where Maytel and Tetsuro You know, they meet up with the Galaxy Railways guys and some weird dimension planet for that, you know against the bad guy It's an OAV.

480
00:28:57,076 --> 00:28:57,740
Scott: That's what they do.

481
00:28:57,901 --> 00:28:59,409
Rym: That is what they do, you know.

482
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:07,130
Scott: But yeah, if you know, it's like if you're already a Galaxy train fan, then Galaxy Railways will probably work out for you.

483
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:12,469
Scott: If you're not you might be a little bit lost, but you should be able to understand it.

484
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:21,396
Scott: but I think the reason that you'll be lost is because a lot of the enjoyment I got show from the show honestly is because I was like I already knew what the Galaxy Railways was.

485
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:25,390
Scott: and in the other shows the Galaxy Railways like they never show you anyone's face.

486
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:36,138
Rym: It's like this mysterious and incredibly powerful overseer of the train would be kind of like if you what if they made an Ava spin-off that was about like all the Background character.

487
00:29:36,178 --> 00:29:37,830
Scott: Yeah, an Ava spin-off that was about Sele.

488
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:42,026
Scott: It was just like Sele guys hanging out like what's up and you could totally see them and they were yeah, right?

489
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:42,749
Scott: That's her.

490
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,850
Scott: so it's like you know.

491
00:29:45,910 --> 00:30:00,744
Scott: so the fact that I had this mystique of the Galaxy Railways and the show builds on that is what sort of gives it a Lot of its feeling and if you don't have that care for the Galaxy Railways as an organization Some of that feeling may be lost but the show Still hold up.

492
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:06,445
Scott: I feel like You don't need to have any pre knowledge to understand what's going on of the Galaxy Express.

493
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:07,468
Rym: 3 9 that I've seen.

494
00:30:07,488 --> 00:30:12,403
Rym: the Galaxy Railways is basically the in the Chinese kung-fu movie.

495
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,090
Rym: The guy in the white suit is not doing anything.

496
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,985
Rym: Yeah, well, he does something a couple every now and then he comes in and does something.

497
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:18,413
Rym: then he goes away and you want to Know where he went.

498
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:21,070
Scott: Yeah, this is guy in white suit kicking ass every episode.

499
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:26,130
Scott: Of course, of course, you know, there's another level of guys in white suits, you know to keep the show interesting.

500
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:32,056
Rym: So it wasn't that long ago actually that I watched, you know, remember birdie the mighty the old anime That was actually pretty fun.

501
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:32,719
Scott: I never watched.

502
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,021
Rym: Yeah.

503
00:30:33,182 --> 00:30:34,650
Rym: Yeah, so birdie the mighty was remade.

504
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,258
Rym: I think I did a geek bite on this a while ago.

505
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,203
Rym: birdie the mighty decode.

506
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:53,070
Rym: and then they made a sequel to that which I haven't watched yet and it has the all the same things that I like about the x-men anime birdie the mighty actually had because it's like Superhero sci-fi well choreographed fights good music good animation fun to watch.

507
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:55,364
Rym: I don't really want to say much more about it other than that.

508
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:59,069
Rym: if you're an anime fan Not you know, like an actual like I enjoy anime.

509
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:06,670
Rym: Birdie the mighty decode is one of those kinds of anime that reminds you how much you like even the dumb sci-fi anime.

510
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:07,294
Rym: You know, I've been.

511
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:09,995
Rym: there's something to the dumb sci-fi anime I've been trying to.

512
00:31:10,177 --> 00:31:13,018
Scott: you know, because I've been an anime drought I've been looking for one to go next.

513
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,950
Rym: you really should watch birdie the mighty decode.

514
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,886
Scott: Maybe I'll do birdie the mighty then birdie decode and then birdie decode do.

515
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:19,810
Scott: I'll do the whole thing.

516
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:20,915
Scott: Ah, I've been.

517
00:31:20,935 --> 00:31:21,899
Scott: I've been good at that lately.

518
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,450
Rym: The thing is the original birdie the mighty is a pretty good show.

519
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,050
Rym: I didn't finish it, but I'd seen a whole bunch of it because Gerald recommended it.

520
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,710
Scott: I've seen zero but I haven't heard anyone say anything bad.

521
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:33,178
Rym: Anime had always told me to watch it.

522
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:37,316
Scott: Yeah, I've only heard good things about all birdie the mighties But I've never seen any.

523
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:38,725
Scott: so maybe I'll maybe I'll get on that.

524
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:39,530
Rym: It's just one of those.

525
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:45,044
Rym: It's it's got the kind of over-the-top Anime kind of plot kind of stereotypical.

526
00:31:45,064 --> 00:31:46,130
Rym: you can kind of see where it's going.

527
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,110
Rym: But at the same time the plot is interesting.

528
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:56,469
Rym: It's kind of a giant robo II plot, but bring it scale it back like a hundredfold And her power suit has high heels.

529
00:31:57,691 --> 00:31:58,575
Scott: Maybe now I don't want it.

530
00:31:58,615 --> 00:31:58,776
Scott: Now.

531
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,363
Scott: You're making it not appealing now.

532
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:01,830
Rym: See you'll think that but then you watch it.

533
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,382
Rym: You're like wow, really high heels.

534
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:11,011
Rym: Hey, okay It's definitely like it's kind of playing with the tropes of old anime but doing it in a fun way Mm-hmm.

535
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:12,416
Scott: All right, another show.

536
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:14,282
Scott: I watched completely all of that.

537
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:21,106
Scott: I know I think there's some OAVs and movies I haven't seen but I watched the entire Votoms TV series all three parts.

538
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:24,230
Rym: I've seen 11 episodes of photons, right?

539
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,244
Scott: So basically the deal with photons is this right.

540
00:32:27,264 --> 00:32:29,896
Scott: you got this guy Who is on.

541
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:37,803
Scott: he's in some military where they use, you know powered armors that are sort of like battle mechs But smaller kind of gun to me, but you know the shit gun lower non Gundam.

542
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,669
Scott: Yeah, the slow lumbering type, right?

543
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:49,290
Scott: and he's on some secret mission and During the secret mission he encounters some weird secret of space like this Magical girl of some kind and he doesn't know what the fuck's going on.

544
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:54,566
Scott: And then he you know sort of escapes this secret mission and he loses memory.

545
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:59,230
Scott: and he like all you know He basically he doesn't have any memory before that mission and he's sort of like what the fuck.

546
00:33:00,572 --> 00:33:02,624
Scott: So the show's you know, and it's the story of what.

547
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:03,690
Scott: what's up with this guy.

548
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,770
Scott: He has no memory really but he's an awesome pilot of mech suits.

549
00:33:08,472 --> 00:33:13,047
Scott: So part one is like he's trapped in this city, you know where there's all this bad guys going on.

550
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:21,077
Scott: in part two He's on another planet in a jungle scenario and in part three He's on a completely different planet.

551
00:33:21,118 --> 00:33:23,405
Scott: Well, he's first he's in space then he's on a different planet.

552
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:38,390
Scott: So part one You know obviously starts off with that secret mission and then it's sort of you know Builds and it's a big sort of gets in this groove of being a pretty typical mech show like be quality You know, it's alright, you know, we got a mech show going on here some interesting stuff

553
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:46,350
Rym: I mean, it's the kind of thing like while people in our crew put it on while we were in Wildwood on the shore And just like, you know put six episodes on in a row while we're dicking around playing games.

554
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,850
Scott: It's sort of like a Gundam but a little bit less, you know good, right?

555
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,860
Rym: Yeah, also a little less gun to me and a little more military.

556
00:33:53,402 --> 00:34:00,610
Rym: Yeah, and it's a little more like this from what I saw It's a little closer to some of the stuff that goes on like Venus Wars in terms of the way people fight.

557
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:09,833
Scott: Definitely the style of it is definitely more that you know early 90s, you know tank police kind of aesthetic Tank police again.

558
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:13,967
Scott: Anyway, so part two in the jungle actually starts off.

559
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:26,989
Scott: We were kind of like But then it sort of builds towards something and you're like, oh, okay They're bringing it back into the plot because the beginning of that second arc with the jungle I was sort of being like what should I stop watching because I'm not too interested now

560
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,409
Rym: It seems like it's definitely a show worth watching and I will finish it someday.

561
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:34,250
Scott: But then the third part, right?

562
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,952
Scott: This is you know, it's like, you know people talk about shows like Gao Gai Ga and how they start off crap and then get Good later.

563
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:45,150
Scott: So right and I'm always like it's not worth sitting through crap for to get to the good part, right?

564
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:51,670
Scott: But photons is like you sit through the slightly above average part to get to the above average part.

565
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:53,496
Scott: It doesn't get amazing.

566
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:54,803
Scott: It gets pretty great.

567
00:34:54,943 --> 00:34:56,530
Scott: Good great good, right?

568
00:34:56,831 --> 00:35:03,530
Scott: So it's basically BB BBB and you get to part three and it's like a - right a - that's some pretty heady praise.

569
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,861
Scott: It's pretty good, you know, but it's not like the best.

570
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:22,390
Scott: Yeah, but yeah the So that third part basically is where it busts out, you know The anime sci-fi stuff we're like, there's the terrible secret of space What it is love old sci-fi stuff where the terrible secret is revealed and then there's like ten more episodes.

571
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:23,156
Rym: Yeah, that's exactly.

572
00:35:23,176 --> 00:35:29,166
Scott: that's the thing right because in a lot of shows There'll be a terrible secret of space that might be revealed at the very very end.

573
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:31,815
Scott: eska flown a yep Right the very very end.

574
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:39,278
Scott: they reveal it and we're done or they'll sort of half reveal it and they won't Completely answer everything and then they're done vote Tom's.

575
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:46,190
Scott: they answer 99 or a hundred percent of the terrible secret of space Well before the final final final episode.

576
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:57,210
Scott: So they actually you know It's like you learn a lot of terrible secrets of space and they build on it over quite a few episodes Towards the end of that third arc and there's sort of also sub secrets of space.

577
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,502
Scott: So it's like square bosses upon square bosses and each one is a good one.

578
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:04,370
Scott: So that third arc is is pretty good.

579
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,779
Scott: I liked it and you're pumping me up.

580
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,430
Rym: I think I'll have to move this up in the queue.

581
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:13,901
Scott: Yeah, so if you haven't watched the vote Tom's and you like sci-fi Animes go for it.

582
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,410
Scott: and then you know, it is a mecha show.

583
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:25,590
Scott: There are robot fights, but actually there's like a lot less robot fighting than say, you know a Gundam or whatever It's and when there is it seems like I said more like a venus wars fight.

584
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:33,474
Scott: Yeah, and the thing is in the early lucky a little there are some things that are you know presented as like tournaments But not really.

585
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:47,279
Scott: it's pretty much like, you know, hey you you know, we're it's part of the plot like hey We're gonna use you You know to fight for money in in the games because you have these mad robot skills and then he sort of tries to escape From them is not like it's not like they ever

586
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:50,150
Rym: actually why would you try to escape for one must fall 2097?

587
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,990
Scott: Yeah, it's not like a tournament ever actually happens or anything like that.

588
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:58,430
Scott: Right, all the robot fighting is actually battles that make that have a reason in the context of the plot.

589
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:09,470
Scott: It's never like one battle per episode because you have to like that and because and the robots actually are sort of all you know More I mean there are sort of superpowers, right?

590
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:16,438
Scott: And sci-fi things that make them, you know, some people just awesome Coordinators new types.

591
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,847
Scott: Yeah, pretty much exactly that.

592
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:25,640
Scott: but Even though eat despite that the robots are pretty slow and lumbering and the weapon attacks are pretty real, you know more.

593
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,305
Scott: I Guess not realistic but more like battle tech and less like less firing the lone greens.

594
00:37:31,426 --> 00:37:32,529
Scott: Yeah less of that.

595
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:42,410
Rym: So speaking of B plus a minus anime and terrible secrets of space I watched all of scrap princess instead of going to a class at RIT and I then failed.

596
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:45,999
Scott: I never watched the scrap print Watch four episodes at an anime club meeting.

597
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,610
Rym: that princess is a solid B plus.

598
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:50,718
Scott: I think it's largely forgotten by people.

599
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:53,127
Rym: I know scrap princess the plot of scrap princess.

600
00:37:53,408 --> 00:37:57,343
Rym: on the surface It is a fantasy world, you know, there's wizards and it's not remember.

601
00:37:57,383 --> 00:37:59,110
Scott: There's not too many fantasy anime out there.

602
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,426
Rym: Yeah, I should add this to that animation C panel on hey fantasy anime.

603
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:07,210
Rym: There aren't that many Yeah, but it's a fantasy world on the surface, but really it's sci-fi.

604
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:11,710
Rym: It's one of those worlds where everyone is magic and wizards and swords and whatnot.

605
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,338
Rym: But yet the terrible secret of space.

606
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:24,512
Rym: it's kind of obvious from a meta level that the magic is actually very advanced science but people have forgotten and There's space plot that people don't see coming Uh-huh.

607
00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:30,227
Rym: I'm trying to avoid spoiling but also spoiling just enough to get people to consider watching the show that yes.

608
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:35,150
Rym: This is a space Sci-fi terrible secret show that pretends to be fantasy.

609
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:37,690
Scott: So it's like it was a sci-fi world.

610
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:41,290
Scott: But then some sort of apocalypse happened that turned it into a fantasy.

611
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:43,459
Rym: It picks up in kind of in media res.

612
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:53,890
Rym: the story is that the scrapped princess is a girl Who for various reasons is destined as far as the establishment of this world says the protectors of the world the rulers?

613
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:54,612
Rym: Everyone.

614
00:38:55,155 --> 00:38:56,702
Rym: she will destroy the world.

615
00:38:56,944 --> 00:39:00,209
Scott: So when she turns a certain age Why don't you just kill her before then?

616
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:02,860
Rym: The world is like, alright, we figured this out.

617
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,664
Rym: We're going to murder her.

618
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:04,790
Scott: Well, how do they know this?

619
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,236
Scott: Where's the legend come from?

620
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,662
Rym: So this is that's part of the plot.

621
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,490
Rym: You don't know right away where this comes from.

622
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,594
Rym: It's just everybody knows it.

623
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:11,879
Rym: That's like the legend of forever.

624
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:12,883
Scott: So how do they know?

625
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:13,184
Scott: it's her?

626
00:39:13,204 --> 00:39:14,710
Rym: Uh, well, that's the plot.

627
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:15,135
Rym: they know.

628
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:21,664
Rym: okay, and some people Smuggle her away and try to protect her because they think this is all bullshit.

629
00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:23,090
Scott: Oh, oh they did.

630
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:24,632
Scott: They really just care about her They don't.

631
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:27,206
Scott: I thought that they were just people who you know wanted the world.

632
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:27,769
Rym: one of them.

633
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:33,347
Rym: So one of them cares about her but basically says if it turns out that this is true I love you, but I will kill you.

634
00:39:34,132 --> 00:39:34,734
Scott: See I thought it.

635
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:38,307
Rym: see but that's like the other person just cares about her and thinks this is bullshit.

636
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:39,150
Rym: It's it's complicated.

637
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:40,230
Scott: Yeah, that's kind of weird though.

638
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:49,769
Scott: It's like they they saving her because they care about her as if it's like the real reason to save her because you want the World to end not because well, maybe there are people who want that too.

639
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,432
Rym: It's a kind of.

640
00:39:50,453 --> 00:40:00,347
Rym: there's a lot of characters in this show and it kind of it starts out slightly Episodic like a lot of shows like that do and then it actually the sci-fi plot builds and builds and builds.

641
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:01,170
Rym: the characters are great.

642
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,574
Rym: There's a couple of really big turnabouts.

643
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:05,342
Rym: It's BB plus BB plus all the way through.

644
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:10,578
Rym: it would have been an a-minus show Except you know how I said.

645
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:13,990
Rym: I like a show where the terrible secret is revealed and then you've got like ten more episodes.

646
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:16,610
Rym: So the last episode, right?

647
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:21,930
Rym: The I catch happens halfway through the episode, you know, Jack and shit.

648
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:31,975
Rym: Okay, the second half of the last episode Reveals the entire terrible secret from space resolves it all and has the epilogue Mm-hmm.

649
00:40:32,418 --> 00:40:39,870
Rym: I don't know if they ran out of money I don't know what but this show could have been a-minus if they had done that like even an episode earlier.

650
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:42,181
Scott: Yeah, so does it like.

651
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:43,850
Scott: does the pacing get really fast at the end?

652
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:48,570
Rym: Like oh the pacing is the same rate all the way through and then after the I cash.

653
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,603
Rym: And yeah, like it's it's crazy.

654
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:52,984
Rym: I can't.

655
00:40:53,044 --> 00:41:00,190
Rym: I can't think of any show short of What's that show that ended early.

656
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:04,993
Rym: They ran out of money as they said fuck it A lot of them.

657
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,904
Rym: Well, I'll look it up later and put it in the show notes.

658
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:08,325
Rym: cuz I can't.

659
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:09,530
Rym: the title just escapes me.

660
00:41:10,074 --> 00:41:11,729
Scott: Okay, there's a lot of shows that did that.

661
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:17,770
Rym: Yeah But anyway that that's my only complaint with the show and that brings it down to the B plus instead of the a-minus.

662
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:21,384
Rym: But it's definitely worth watching if you're looking for a pretty good anime to watch.

663
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:22,368
Rym: pretty good.

664
00:41:22,408 --> 00:41:25,993
Scott: Not great All right Let's see here.

665
00:41:26,033 --> 00:41:26,334
Scott: You know what?

666
00:41:26,355 --> 00:41:29,446
Scott: I watch what you are 100% of the galaxy.

667
00:41:29,507 --> 00:41:30,410
Rym: frow line, Yuna.

668
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:32,255
Scott: I only watched a part of that.

669
00:41:32,436 --> 00:41:34,703
Scott: Anyway, I should finish it though.

670
00:41:34,863 --> 00:41:35,485
Scott: It's not that long.

671
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,328
Rym: Oh, it's not.

672
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:37,070
Rym: I've got it right there.

673
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:44,741
Scott: I watched all the Pat LeBourde the OAV TV series second TV series second OAV movie movie movie.

674
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:45,784
Scott: I've watched all of.

675
00:41:45,864 --> 00:41:47,970
Rym: I've only seen movie see.

676
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,376
Scott: But here's something that happened, right?

677
00:41:49,396 --> 00:41:51,747
Scott: So I knew Pat LeBourde was a cool thing at RIT.

678
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,670
Scott: I tried to watch a bunch of it.

679
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,261
Scott: I watched two movies on VHS and I watched.

680
00:41:56,523 --> 00:41:58,210
Scott: the VHS is from the anime club.

681
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,670
Scott: But the VHS from the anime club were sort of screwy.

682
00:42:01,411 --> 00:42:04,245
Scott: See people don't know this but the laser discs of Pat LeBourde.

683
00:42:04,406 --> 00:42:09,625
Scott: if you bought them The first episode on the laser disc would be an episode from OAV.

684
00:42:09,646 --> 00:42:11,574
Scott: I think one or two I don't remember.

685
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:14,150
Scott: but then the rest of the laser disc would be TV episodes.

686
00:42:14,591 --> 00:42:19,950
Scott: So it was sort of like OAV and TV episodes were mixed on the laser discs and the VHS is restraint from the laser discs.

687
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:26,196
Scott: So they were also mixed up also and I sort of didn't know I didn't have that kind of information in the year 2000.

688
00:42:26,196 --> 00:42:29,802
Scott: Kind of watching you're like man Encyclopedia was not so fully flesh.

689
00:42:29,862 --> 00:42:31,450
Rym: the animation jumps all over the place.

690
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,644
Scott: Well, it was like why the opener changed and the plot wasn't.

691
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:44,188
Rym: you know, I was I you know But I wasn't paying close Like I remember watching this fan sub of like project a co and it had just all this random shit.

692
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:51,710
Rym: after project a co ended Just like 45 minutes of like music videos and stuff Yep, but anyway.

693
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:59,190
Scott: So I went back You know recently and I rewatched all the Pat LeBourde and I understood which parts are which and I'm the right order and everything.

694
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:00,468
Scott: So here's here's how it breaks down.

695
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,305
Scott: Everybody in the entire universe should watch Pat LeBourde OAV number one.

696
00:43:05,345 --> 00:43:06,650
Scott: that is made by Mamoru Oshii.

697
00:43:07,172 --> 00:43:08,759
Scott: It is the first Pat LeBourde there is.

698
00:43:08,779 --> 00:43:11,350
Scott: it is a hundred percent awesome and it's only a few episodes.

699
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:15,650
Scott: It's made of tons of win, right and that introduces you to everything.

700
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:24,710
Scott: Everyone in the entire goddamn universe should watch Pat LeBourde movies one and two also made by Mamoru Oshii Also made of tons of win all over the place, right movies are good.

701
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,698
Scott: That's some of the best anime movies ever.

702
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:29,710
Scott: and the thing is you can watch the movies without having seen that first OAV.

703
00:43:30,011 --> 00:43:35,058
Scott: But I recommend watching the OAV first anyway Because you'll get more familiar with the characters.

704
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,670
Scott: and really characters are what drives Pat LeBourde right more.

705
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,929
Scott: So, you know it has robots, but it's basically the robots in the show.

706
00:43:43,471 --> 00:43:47,445
Scott: They're just basically police cars, you know, it's like kind of like Gasaraki.

707
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:48,790
Rym: the robots are just tanks.

708
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:52,289
Scott: Yeah, they just happen to be drawn as robots, right?

709
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:54,652
Scott: The show would work.

710
00:43:55,013 --> 00:43:56,437
Scott: It's basically a police show.

711
00:43:56,497 --> 00:44:01,070
Scott: It might as well be Odoro Daisousasen only they happen to have police robots.

712
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,778
Rym: Oh my god, I could watch that movie again.

713
00:44:02,898 --> 00:44:05,590
Scott: In fact, it's incredibly like Odoro Daisousasen.

714
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:07,156
Scott: I put it in the exact same genre.

715
00:44:07,236 --> 00:44:09,565
Rym: We've done a show on Odoro Daisousasen, right?

716
00:44:09,826 --> 00:44:10,930
Scott: I think we did a long time ago.

717
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:14,224
Rym: I feel like we should watch it again and do it a show on it.

718
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:15,710
Rym: I know I'll get it.

719
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,379
Scott: I'll get both of them.

720
00:44:17,419 --> 00:44:18,243
Scott: Rainbow Bridge also.

721
00:44:18,263 --> 00:44:23,550
Scott: Rainbow Bridge wasn't as good though But it was still the part of the beginning that opening scene with the boat with the paintball.

722
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,266
Rym: Yeah, actually the whole thing was great except for the very end, which is kind of just a yeah.

723
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:31,889
Scott: But I mean, you know Rainbow Bridge wasn't as good as part as the original but it was still.

724
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:48,050
Rym: I mean For all you listeners who probably don't know what we're talking about Odoro Daisousasen is a TV series and some movies in Japan about cops Like if you like like you're under arrest like a character driven cop drama mostly humorous also kind of serious.

725
00:44:48,110 --> 00:45:07,657
Rym: But the first movie we watched at RIT and we liked it so much that when I was president of the RIT anime club one of the few one of the big like privileges you get is that on the last day of your tenure the Final like meeting of the year of the season of everything you show whatever the fuck you want And I showed the live-action.

726
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:11,610
Rym: Odoro Daisousasen Bayside Shakedown, baby, and I gave all these hints.

727
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,963
Rym: I was like, yeah, the opening theme is also in Dance Dance Revolution, which is true.

728
00:45:16,184 --> 00:45:16,385
Scott: Yep.

729
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:18,875
Rym: None of you have seen it Which is true.

730
00:45:18,895 --> 00:45:20,829
Rym: It's about cops, which is true.

731
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:25,982
Rym: The show got a standing ovation from the crowd at the end.

732
00:45:26,403 --> 00:45:28,369
Rym: It is one of the best goddamn movies.

733
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:32,940
Scott: Huh this according well not not best in like citizen.

734
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,877
Scott: according to Wikipedia Bayside Shakedown 3 came out in summer 2010 But I'm checking that right now.

735
00:45:37,937 --> 00:45:38,883
Rym: What's wrong with us?

736
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:40,250
Rym: You know, what's wrong with us?

737
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:43,021
Rym: We don't have a video bar to tell us when stuff like that comes out.

738
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:44,467
Scott: I'm doing some searching right now.

739
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:47,502
Scott: But anyway Bayside Shakedown 3.

740
00:45:47,502 --> 00:45:50,517
Scott: Yeah Got hot as a 5.7 and IMDb is it?

741
00:45:53,595 --> 00:45:54,589
Scott: It might be awful.

742
00:45:54,891 --> 00:46:02,938
Rym: Yeah, I think the trouble is Bayside Shakedown is the kind of movie that is besto if you're the kind of person who likes Movies like Attack the Gas Station.

743
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:03,902
Scott: So back to Pat LeVoir.

744
00:46:03,922 --> 00:46:04,725
Rym: Back to Pat LeVoir.

745
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:06,250
Scott: Which is the same genre, right?

746
00:46:06,971 --> 00:46:09,668
Scott: So, you know you got movie 1 movie 2 OAV 1 awesome.

747
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:12,577
Scott: Then you got TV series 1.

748
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:17,590
Scott: TV series 1 is not actually directed by Mamoru Oshii, but a lot of it.

749
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:25,870
Scott: I think he's written some of it directly or indirectly and you can sort of tell Some of the episodes that he had a major influence on and the ones that he didn't, right?

750
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:32,590
Scott: Like there's an episode that has no robots in it and is all about waiting for the Chinese food order to show up.

751
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,538
Rym: There was a Seinfeld about that too.

752
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,519
Scott: And that episode is so clearly Mamoru Oshii's doing, right?

753
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,410
Scott: There's like no robots in it whatsoever and he's like one of the best freaking episodes.

754
00:46:44,812 --> 00:46:48,330
Scott: But anyway, it actually has a contiguous plot that you know goes.

755
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:58,070
Scott: Oh, you know tells a story but some of the episodes are more episodic than others And it's a little bit more light-hearted and less serious sci-fi anime than the movies in the first OAV.

756
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:03,052
Rym: Well kind of like look at the differences between like Ghost in the Shell the anime versus the manga versus the movies Exactly.

757
00:47:03,072 --> 00:47:07,508
Scott: So this is more like the standalone complex to the Ghost in the Shell movie.

758
00:47:07,649 --> 00:47:09,737
Scott: Yeah, right But it's still.

759
00:47:09,757 --> 00:47:11,410
Scott: I really like it a whole lot.

760
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:20,610
Scott: You know, you might not like it as much as the first OAV in the movies But it's still good and it gives you more of those characters and they're in character and it totally works.

761
00:47:20,992 --> 00:47:26,030
Scott: So it's like you're all- Palobor is all about being attached to the characters And if you're attached to them, you're gonna want to watch TV series.

762
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:31,890
Scott: The second OAV comes after the first TV series before the second TV series, right?

763
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:40,983
Scott: I'm pretty sure if I remember correctly and it sort of ties, you know, it's sort of basically Continuation of TV series into.

764
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:46,445
Scott: you know The second yeah, it's like the in-between part.

765
00:47:48,394 --> 00:47:53,561
Scott: It's just like a plot connector Right, so I got a fairly egregious one.

766
00:47:53,601 --> 00:47:54,464
Rym: You do need to see it.

767
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,755
Rym: And then the second time you see gone Yeah, you got more Palobor.

768
00:47:57,935 --> 00:48:03,444
Scott: Yeah, and the second TV series is sort of like, all right, you know we're just gonna keep going.

769
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:05,321
Scott: and The quality- Just like you?

770
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:10,729
Scott: Yeah You know the quality goes down.

771
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,081
Scott: You know a little bit but you know, it's still good.

772
00:48:14,403 --> 00:48:19,727
Scott: Yeah, it's one of those like A to A minis I'm trying to remember like maybe there isn't a second TV series.

773
00:48:19,747 --> 00:48:21,592
Rym: Oh Careful now.

774
00:48:21,753 --> 00:48:22,495
Scott: This is the problem.

775
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:24,422
Scott: According to Anime News Network, there isn't.

776
00:48:24,522 --> 00:48:29,123
Scott: I'm just remembering things fucked up like Anyway, all right old man Scott.

777
00:48:29,224 --> 00:48:29,910
Scott: Yeah old man me.

778
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,590
Scott: But anyway, you should watch all the Palobors.

779
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:38,702
Rym: So a show that you Scott should watch so we can do a show on it because I think it's actually a great goddamn show Is the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

780
00:48:39,004 --> 00:48:40,070
Scott: I'll have to watch that at some point.

781
00:48:40,171 --> 00:48:43,249
Rym: It's really good and it's not about what you think it's about.

782
00:48:43,752 --> 00:48:44,535
Rym: What do you think it's about?

783
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:46,543
Rym: because you've you've obviously heard about it.

784
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:48,250
Rym: people have said things about based.

785
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:50,481
Scott: I've absorbed a lot of information.

786
00:48:50,601 --> 00:48:52,330
Scott: I've watched a few episodes, right?

787
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,985
Scott: So from what I can tell the few episodes I watched was like, okay, they're in school.

788
00:48:57,406 --> 00:48:58,370
Scott: There's a girl named Haruhi.

789
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,376
Scott: She's totally weird.

790
00:48:59,718 --> 00:49:01,489
Scott: She drags in these other weird people.

791
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:05,462
Scott: Clearly each of the people has something weird about them, right?

792
00:49:05,502 --> 00:49:07,950
Scott: That is some something sci-fi ish, right?

793
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:14,830
Scott: And from what I can tell it's you know It looks to be high school silliness with a weird girl at first glance.

794
00:49:15,392 --> 00:49:22,034
Scott: But really based on all the things people say and all the things that I've just sort of absorbed pulls Scott is Scott.

795
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:23,079
Rym: it pulls a big o2.

796
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,330
Scott: Yeah, it's some sort of end of the world.

797
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,697
Scott: Haruhi is Aliens and who knows well?

798
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:32,650
Rym: here I will summarize it yet simultaneously not actually spoil anything.

799
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:37,289
Rym: I think most of our listeners have probably already seen Haruhi and there's more Haruhi that was made later, but whatever.

800
00:49:37,953 --> 00:49:47,930
Rym: Basically it's about a girl who's obsessed with finding Anything crazy like magic or aliens or ESP or you know any just finding something like that like our friend Scott Johnson.

801
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,323
Rym: If you find one then odds are some other ones out there too.

802
00:49:51,343 --> 00:49:53,210
Rym: Like if you find one vampire shit is on.

803
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:53,852
Scott: That's right.

804
00:49:54,354 --> 00:49:57,587
Rym: So she's obsessed with this and she never finds anything.

805
00:49:57,607 --> 00:49:58,330
Rym: cuz you know cuz whatever.

806
00:49:59,274 --> 00:50:07,849
Rym: It just so happens that everyone around her is one of those things Except for this one guy who's friends with her and he sees all this crazy stuff and she doesn't see it.

807
00:50:08,532 --> 00:50:11,329
Rym: Like she can't find it, but he's always like running afoul of it.

808
00:50:11,872 --> 00:50:15,930
Rym: There's a lot more to it than that, but that's kind of the the first layer gist of this.

809
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:20,607
Scott: That's why she's melancholy because she can't find any of these awesome things bored with existence.

810
00:50:20,627 --> 00:50:21,410
Rym: She's bored with life.

811
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,514
Rym: She's bored with everything.

812
00:50:22,534 --> 00:50:24,721
Rym: Uh-huh, and it's just.

813
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:25,705
Rym: it's a good show really.

814
00:50:25,745 --> 00:50:26,527
Rym: It's solidly done.

815
00:50:26,547 --> 00:50:30,422
Rym: The animation is great The story is great that the the moral of it is pretty good.

816
00:50:30,482 --> 00:50:33,474
Rym: It's it's I call it an anime Mm-hmm.

817
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,747
Scott: All right, so I figured out why I was fucked up in the head with Pat LaVoir.

818
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:41,142
Scott: because you're old No, because OAV - basically might as well be TV - right.

819
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:43,691
Scott: so I was remembering them sort of like two separate things Really?

820
00:50:43,711 --> 00:50:44,172
Scott: They're the same.

821
00:50:44,212 --> 00:50:49,786
Scott: so you watch right so it's the TV right and then the OAV - comes after it.

822
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,915
Scott: the OAV one Comes first.

823
00:50:52,995 --> 00:51:08,930
Scott: So it's OAV one then TV then TV - then movie movie movie if you want to go chronologically Right, but the movie standalone the third movie actually Doesn't really have the characters in it has like these other characters who aside characters gonna be see destiny.

824
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,310
Scott: Yeah, it has like, you know, it's basically focuses on these two detectives.

825
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,139
Scott: It's still an okay anime sci-fi movie, but it's not.

826
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:18,912
Scott: it's not like super awesome Pat LaVoir, but it's in the Pat LaVoir universe All right.

827
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:24,330
Rym: All right, you know the even more egregious than Hari the fact you haven't actually seen Irresponsible Captain Tyler.

828
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:25,755
Scott: I watched a ton of it though.

829
00:51:25,775 --> 00:51:27,682
Scott: Yes, but 11 episodes.

830
00:51:27,763 --> 00:51:29,088
Rym: Yeah, but you didn't even get to.

831
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:29,710
Rym: it's one of those shows.

832
00:51:29,872 --> 00:51:32,173
Rym: It's like big O where you know What's part of the movie.

833
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:33,397
Rym: the first half is great.

834
00:51:33,778 --> 00:51:36,528
Rym: And then the second half is like oh, oh, oh, I see.

835
00:51:36,548 --> 00:51:40,849
Scott: Oh, oh I'm sure I'll watch it at some point, but it's I don't have a DVD box.

836
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:42,015
Rym: it I've got it.

837
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:45,090
Rym: if I didn't lend it to anyone I'll lend it to you, but I think I lent it to someone.

838
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:47,164
Scott: Oh, well, then I can't be borrowing again.

839
00:51:47,184 --> 00:51:47,728
Rym: I will find it.

840
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:48,633
Rym: It's.

841
00:51:49,316 --> 00:51:55,942
Rym: it's on my like triple-a top list Like I put it at the top with cowboy bebop and Ava.

842
00:51:56,203 --> 00:51:56,724
Scott: No you do.

843
00:51:56,945 --> 00:51:58,250
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what else does.

844
00:51:58,672 --> 00:52:00,038
Rym: Oh, I think you might.

845
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:04,795
Rym: then once you see it all it has It's definitely possible.

846
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:11,650
Rym: It has a scene at the end where somebody salutes somebody and it is off the hook Rainbow Dash.

847
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:16,843
Scott: Anyway, so I'm gonna talk about a manga that I read now.

848
00:52:16,964 --> 00:52:18,370
Scott: it's called seven billion needles.

849
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:22,110
Scott: It was put out by vertical in the US and it's actually only four little volumes.

850
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:29,605
Scott: so you can totally get the whole thing real easy like all right, and Basically the story in seven billion needles is this is girl who's mad bored with everything.

851
00:52:29,886 --> 00:52:31,855
Scott: All right, she's in school She doesn't have friends.

852
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:32,681
Scott: She doesn't talk to anyone.

853
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:34,050
Scott: She sits there with the headphones on all day.

854
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:44,315
Scott: she's like I fuck this shit, right and then she's on the beach for some reason and something comes crashing out of space terrible secret and Actually possesses her.

855
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:47,550
Scott: but it doesn't possess her like you're possessed by the demon.

856
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:53,590
Scott: It's sort of like aha now, I'm living in your body alongside you right some sort of space spirit.

857
00:52:53,710 --> 00:53:00,230
Scott: I'm sort of symbiote right something and it talks to her in her brain, right and It also has incredible powers.

858
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:05,990
Scott: But this thing has morals so it won't just control her without her permission or use her body without her permission.

859
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,038
Rym: Right, how birdie the mighty is a lot of that.

860
00:53:08,098 --> 00:53:11,190
Scott: Anyway, yeah, cuz it pretty much is about the guy who transforms into right.

861
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:13,882
Rym: Yeah, because she punches him to death by accident in any way.

862
00:53:13,922 --> 00:53:22,350
Scott: Yeah, but anyway, so So this thing possesses her and basically tells her look there's some horrible evil thing is basically the opposite of me.

863
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:29,492
Scott: It's an horrible evil thing that possesses and doesn't have morals and wants to like eat your whole world and I chase it here from Outer space.

864
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:32,181
Scott: so we have to find it and you know do what I say.

865
00:53:32,201 --> 00:53:37,841
Scott: and over the course of four volumes It actually, you know, you think of four volumes.

866
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:42,665
Scott: this the story is gonna be find it Get beat by it then come back beat at the end.

867
00:53:42,746 --> 00:53:53,476
Scott: But actually Pretty early it's like they encounter it and some crazy shit happens and a big change happens and it swings another direction Really quickly, huh?

868
00:53:54,077 --> 00:54:01,208
Scott: And it's like whoa, that's really surprising and I didn't actually read the fourth volume yet I'm gonna reread from one two, three, four and one go just so I can get the whole picture.

869
00:54:02,651 --> 00:54:06,885
Scott: So I could imagine another big swing near the end being very likely.

870
00:54:06,905 --> 00:54:26,310
Scott: so, you know If if you like, you know sci-fi animes or mangas at least, you know And you like things that are short and cheap, but also a highbrow Right without a lot of dragging out of fights or anything like that You should definitely pick up all four volumes of seven billion needles at your earliest opportunity.

871
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,500
Rym: Alright, we should probably wind this down.

872
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,506
Rym: I guess I just got one more.

873
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:30,230
Rym: I don't you have any more.

874
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:31,118
Scott: I could do a quick one.

875
00:54:31,158 --> 00:54:37,950
Rym: if I'll do a quick one, too I'll skip on all these things that I got listed here, but this is kind of an old one.

876
00:54:38,393 --> 00:54:40,790
Rym: But have you actually read any of the earthsakes are a manga?

877
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:42,919
Scott: No, I didn't know there was a manga.

878
00:54:42,939 --> 00:54:44,509
Scott: I thought it was incredibly long anime and that was it.

879
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,578
Rym: It's also incredibly long manga.

880
00:54:46,598 --> 00:54:48,988
Scott: I did not know that because it's done by miss.

881
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,980
Rym: Let's write incredibly long manga that don't go anywhere.

882
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,767
Scott: Oh, I guess that's true.

883
00:54:53,787 --> 00:54:59,766
Rym: Yeah Yeah, so the earthsakes are a manga is up your alley to a degree that is startling you realize.

884
00:54:59,847 --> 00:55:02,398
Scott: I'm sure I know it is But it's like I got to get.

885
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,330
Scott: all of earthsakes are is very difficult.

886
00:55:04,663 --> 00:55:09,278
Rym: Yeah I mean everyone I know Read the old volumes that were put out in America.

887
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:13,510
Rym: that were bound very poorly and fell apart immediately like so fast.

888
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:18,818
Rym: It's ridiculous, but it's like you like Hakaba, Kitaro, I do.

889
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,142
Rym: it's a lot like that.

890
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:22,590
Rym: It's very like inside baseball.

891
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:27,190
Scott: I would have gotten I would get the entire TV series and all the movies from anime ego.

892
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:31,330
Scott: But they sort of stopped some of this printing some of them and the DDS are always so expensive.

893
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:37,310
Scott: The thing is they would have just made a slim case with the whole thing Guaranteed in one shot with one empty spot.

894
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:41,230
Rym: Remember there was that box set of all the movies except two, but that's all the movies.

895
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:50,526
Scott: I want the whole TV series in a slim case of some kind right and all those movies except for number two You know in a box for like a hundred bucks.

896
00:55:50,566 --> 00:55:51,290
Scott: Yeah, I do it.

897
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,606
Rym: So I guess my thing here is all the roomie go Takahashi stuff because I don't think you've.

898
00:55:54,707 --> 00:55:57,590
Rym: actually I mean Did you how much Ranma have you actually seen or read?

899
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,238
Scott: Maybe five to ten episodes.

900
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:02,749
Rym: I've seen like at least half of Ranma.

901
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:04,729
Rym: How about mezani koku?

902
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:08,699
Scott: One or two episodes and maybe half a manga volume.

903
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:10,624
Rym: I read the whole manga cow style.

904
00:56:11,025 --> 00:56:11,547
Scott: I know you did.

905
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:15,542
Rym: Yeah But I love that that stuff is great.

906
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:17,630
Rym: And I think ursa dessert is my favorite of it.

907
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,481
Rym: But you know what Ranma is some funny shit And I feel like people don't give it enough credit for being so.

908
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:28,804
Rym: I feel like new fans never go to watch Ranma, but I feel like new fans would love Ranma if they just watched it.

909
00:56:29,005 --> 00:56:30,389
Rym: I don't think they realize it's a goonie.

910
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:30,590
Rym: calm.

911
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:38,538
Scott: Yeah, it's almost like it was a gateway drug of you know, some some bygone era and That it was sort of all used up.

912
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:41,030
Scott: and now people are you know using Naruto or whatever?

913
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:50,764
Rym: Yeah, cuz in the old days like I would take friends in high school and they'd never even heard of anime I'd be like watch this I'd show them like one episode of Ranma and they're like wait so this is a show about a guy who turns into a girl and that guy

914
00:56:50,804 --> 00:56:51,729
Scott: and I really get wet and

915
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:55,425
Rym: And they love it and they turn into anime fans.

916
00:56:55,766 --> 00:56:58,557
Scott: Yeah Maybe we should try out some Ranma on.

917
00:56:58,577 --> 00:56:59,802
Scott: some people see if it still works.

943
00:57:56,522 --> 00:58:03,580
