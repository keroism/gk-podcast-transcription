1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,934
Scott: It's Monday, May 24th.

2
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:11,575
Scott: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:12,317
Rym: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:13,720
Scott: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,210
Scott: Tonight we will talk about the non-SQL, non-relational databases.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,928
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,888
Rym: Oh Adobe, why do you have to do this to me?

8
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,000
Rym: So, Audition, I learned how to auto-tune, so watch out.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,229
Scott: You're gonna auto-tune all of GeekNights?

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,173
Rym: I thought about it.

11
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:37,640
Scott: Didn't you have to put a song into auto-tune?

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,083
Rym: Nah, well, there are many ways.

13
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,269
Scott: Doesn't it usually work, like you put the notes in and then it goes...

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,940
Rym: What I didn't realize until recently was that the built-in functionality of Audition, I went back and you know what?

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,164
Rym: Cool that it can do it too.

16
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:53,468
Rym: I can just auto-tune.

17
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:54,852
Rym: I could have auto-tuned at RIT.

18
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:57,120
Rym: Just as good as the auto-tune now.

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,818
Scott: Just as well.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,619
Rym: Yeah, just as goodly.

21
00:01:02,683 --> 00:01:03,959
Scott: Just as well-y.

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,400
Rym: So I'm sad at Adobe for the fact that now I have the ability, if you couldn't tell, to auto-tune, which is not a power that should be put into hands such as mine.

23
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:21,200
Rym: But I'm also sad because Audition, just before we tried to do the show tonight, so I go to record and the input goes red line and then Audition crashes.

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,086
Rym: And I think, huh, that's fucked up.

25
00:01:23,568 --> 00:01:24,130
Rym: That's awesome.

26
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,114
Rym: Let's try this again.

27
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:26,560
Rym: And it happens again.

28
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:30,589
Rym: So I'm trying to troubleshoot and poking around and Scott's getting impatient.

29
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:34,940
Rym: and then I see that, oh, somehow Audition has decided, you know what?

30
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:44,800
Rym: It doesn't want to record from the nice, you know, USB external sound card interface or even the interface on the sound card built into the computer.

31
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,281
Rym: No, no, no.

32
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:47,868
Rym: It found the speakers and said, you know what?

33
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,853
Rym: That is what I'm recording from.

34
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:52,380
Rym: And I don't even know what kind of signal it was getting.

35
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:53,895
Scott: Uh-huh.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,584
Rym: So, you know what?

37
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:58,957
Rym: I think audio software should work 100% by now.

38
00:01:59,057 --> 00:01:59,780
Rym: Fuck you, Adobe.

39
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:04,228
Scott: You know, I realized people, you know, the complaints about Linux.

40
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:06,472
Scott: audio are, you know, slightly bubbling again.

41
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:10,660
Scott: It sucks since, I don't know, the year 1990 and it still sucks, right?

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,962
Scott: Linux isn't that old.

43
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:22,976
Scott: So, but, you know, the thing is, I was looking at some other stuff and like audio sucks on pretty much every OS.

44
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:25,660
Scott: It sucks on OS X. It sucks on Windows.

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,084
Scott: This guy had a flow chart, right?

46
00:02:27,124 --> 00:02:33,000
Scott: And the flow chart was like, okay, which, if you're making a game, what audio thing do you use on Windows?

47
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,465
Scott: And it was like a big flow chart.

48
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:39,720
Scott: And pretty much the only one that didn't suck was this one that cost a fuck ton of money.

49
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,361
Rym: Well, that's it.

50
00:02:40,422 --> 00:02:46,140
Rym: I mean, a lot, like if you really want to edit Pro Tools, despite all the problems that I still say it has, it's not that bad.

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,800
Rym: What really bothers me is that way back in the day, like I would try to use something like, well, I guess the precursors to Audition, you know, before I learned Cool Edit.

52
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,866
Rym: And I would complain about the interface, like, ah, this interface is crap.

53
00:02:57,387 --> 00:03:01,696
Rym: And experts would always say things to me like, well, you're just not an expert in the field.

54
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,940
Rym: You don't understand what a good interface is for this application.

55
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Scott: Are you going to talk about how people psychologically like a complicated interface?

56
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,260
Rym: No, I'm going to go straight, I'm going to go in a slightly different tack because that was true about audio.

57
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,400
Scott: Because there was, someone figured that out, that basically, you know, like, let's say I'm a so-and-so engineer, right?

58
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,480
Rym: Well, the best example was the stupid Bloomberg terminals I deal with at work.

59
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,921
Scott: Exactly.

60
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:29,239
Scott: Well, I have to remember, that's what the article is talking about, is why the Bloomberg terminal is complicated and silly looking with a fancy keyboard when it doesn't need to be.

61
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:34,340
Scott: It's because it makes people who know how to use it feel like they're special and feel like they're smart.

62
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:42,113
Scott: And, you know, it makes them feel like they have a valuable skill when really they just, you know, learn this arbitrarily complicated interface.

63
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:43,776
Scott: that psychologically makes them feel good.

64
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:45,520
Scott: And that's pretty much it.

65
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:50,411
Rym: But, you know, back in the day, I complained about, I'm trying to learn how to use CoolEdit to do stuff, and I complained.

66
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:51,834
Rym: I was like, "Eh, this interface sucks,".

67
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:53,598
Rym: and the expert said, "No, you just don't understand

68
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:53,699
Rym: it.".

69
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,713
Rym: And then I learned audio engineering, and I realized that the interface was actually freaking awesome for what I was trying to do.

70
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:00,214
Rym: It was great.

71
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:02,520
Rym: The interface was exactly what I needed.

72
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:06,869
Rym: And the interface in Audition is still exactly what I need.

73
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:11,840
Rym: The problem is, half the time, the interface just doesn't fucking work and things just break and crash.

74
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:15,994
Rym: So they finally got the front end of audio right, as far as I can tell.

75
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:17,800
Rym: It's just the back end is garbage.

76
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:26,594
Rym: So then, you know, I have Premiere, I have the whole production premium creative suite, Adobe, everything, and I had all these complaints.

77
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,077
Rym: Like, I tried to use Premiere, and I'm like, "You know what?

78
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:29,058
Rym: This sucks for

79
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:29,399
Rym: video.".

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,435
Rym: And I went to some video experts, and they're like, "Well, you're just stupid and don't understand.

81
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:35,499
Rym: It's just like you were with audio

82
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:35,820
Rym: before.".

83
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:49,140
Rym: But then I talked to people who do audio and video both for a living, and the uniform consensus among experts is that Premiere is a god-awful piece of shit, and no one worth any amount of skill or money would ever touch it.

84
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,740
Scott: It seems like everyone uses the really expensive Apple Final Cut thing.

85
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,811
Rym: Yeah, everyone said, "Why don't you use Final

86
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:54,992
Rym: Cut?".

87
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,099
Rym: And I was like, "I'm not gonna buy a

88
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:56,220
Rym: Mac.".

89
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:57,726
Scott: You wanna pay for it?

90
00:04:57,786 --> 00:04:58,851
Scott: Think about how much that costs.

91
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,920
Scott: You get the cost of a Mac plus the cost of Final Cut.

92
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,640
Rym: Or Avid, but we're not going there.

93
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,960
Scott: Yeah, I don't know what that is anyway.

94
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:16,300
Rym: Regardless, and more and more I've been finding that as an audio engineer, audio software, it's really only back-end details and polish behind the interface that are the problems these days.

95
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,262
Scott: Oh yeah, I mean, think about it.

96
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:18,304
Scott: You're playing a game, right?

97
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:19,847
Scott: Or you're making a game.

98
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:22,934
Scott: The interface of interacting with the audio is not bad.

99
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:24,197
Scott: You get a little volume meter, right?

100
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:25,480
Scott: There's nothing bad about that.

101
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,411
Scott: The problem is, is like, the audio just won't work.

102
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,540
Scott: Or your surround sound won't actually be surround.

103
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,242
Rym: But here's the worst part.

104
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:33,370
Rym: The audio stuff itself is great.

105
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,460
Rym: Like all the direct, like this filter, that filter, all that stuff is great.

106
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:46,440
Rym: The problem really is that Adobe doesn't bother to finish all the kind of minor details like the program doesn't crash and the program can import all forms of audio correctly.

107
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,858
Rym: Anyway, I'm just, I'm feeling angry at Adobe lately because it fails me in minor, but...

108
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,280
Scott: And 'cause you paid a lot of money for crap.

109
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,616
Rym: Basically I paid a lot of money because it's the professional stuff and it does what I need, which, you know, the non-professional stuff literally doesn't.

110
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:03,380
Rym: Like CMYK and Photoshop.

111
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,826
Rym: And Photoshop is the same as Audition in my opinion.

112
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,450
Rym: Like the interface, like it is good.

113
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,553
Rym: It's a good application.

114
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:12,600
Rym: But it still fails in these subtle integration things.

115
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,212
Rym: Like the fact that the Adobe installer is not well integrated with Windows bothers me.

116
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:23,860
Rym: The fact that Adobe software does not talk to other Adobe software very well bothers me.

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,499
Scott: Well isn't that supposed to be what the Bridges thing is for?

118
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:34,340
Rym: Yeah, but the Bridge has issues and a lot of times when I import files, even if I use the Adobe Media Converter, it just fucks up.

119
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:42,758
Rym: And if I go to the Adobe support and say, "And open a ticket," their answer is basically, "Yeah, we don't actually really support that format like FLV or

120
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:43,279
Rym: MPEG4.".

121
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,800
Rym: Never, I'm not gonna get into containers and all that, but you get my drift.

122
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,843
Scott: Yeah, anyway.

123
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,129
Scott: So I got this new laptop here.

124
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,336
Scott: It's a Lenovo X201.

125
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:55,860
Scott: It was like a crazy sale.

126
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:03,220
Rym: I gotta say, if I could not make due with my current laptop and I needed to buy one right now, I would have bought pretty much the same one.

127
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,531
Scott: See, I could have continued to make due with the one I had, the Fujitsu P7230.

128
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:10,996
Scott: But it was getting a little breaky, right?

129
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:12,780
Scott: First of all, that's a technical term, breaky.

130
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:20,220
Scott: Basically, it had two batteries, but if I used both of them at the same time, sometimes it would just turn off.

131
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,892
Scott: And I could tell it was a problem with the extra battery, which, by the way, wasn't lasting all that long.

132
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,776
Scott: It was lasting 20 minutes.

133
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,820
Scott: It wasn't really boosting me very much at all.

134
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:35,280
Scott: So I got rid of that second battery and I put the plastic placeholder to reduce the weight.

135
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,759
Scott: And the big battery in the back was still all good because I had barely used it ever because I had mostly lived off the small one.

136
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:46,712
Scott: And, you know, it wasn't turning off randomly, but it was still getting a little eh.

137
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:50,260
Scott: The screen had a little scuffiness on it, you know.

138
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,332
Scott: And, you know, just generally the core solo was a little slow.

139
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:56,380
Scott: Like you go to YouTube and it'd be eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

140
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,096
Scott: You know, you'd try to play like certain Flash games, it'd be like, "Uh, I can't really do this very

141
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:01,398
Scott: well.".

142
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,859
Scott: And we started working on, you know, like Project Dorf or whatever, and it'd be like, "Uh, I can't even do Project Dorf, I'm so

143
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:09,100
Scott: weak.".

144
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,800
Rym: Well, I remember way back when you started playing Dwarf Fortress and you were playing on that laptop and it was so slow and you were complaining about it.

145
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:20,200
Rym: And I turned it on my laptop with the Core 2 and it blew by just a million turns a second.

146
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,561
Scott: Yep.

147
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:26,100
Scott: So, you know, I kept looking at the Lenovo site because I knew it wanted a tiny X series, you know.

148
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:33,460
Scott: And, you know, I kept checking it once in a while and I checked it, you know, one day a couple weeks ago and the price was like crazy low.

149
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,844
Scott: It was like $1400 for like the best X201.

150
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:36,969
Scott: I got like a 128 gig solid state drive and it's got like an i5.

151
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,387
Scott: They just announced like newer i5s and i7s for laptops.

152
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:49,300
Scott: But it's basically almost, it's only slightly faster than the one I've got, so big deal, right?

153
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,085
Rym: Actually, it worked.

154
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:52,120
Rym: They just, you know, I kept complaining my computer was slow.

155
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,064
Scott: And this one is so crazy fast.

156
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:56,980
Scott: This computer is like, you know, the video card and it's just some Intel poop, whatever.

157
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:04,118
Scott: So I can't do for real 3D gaming like I can on my desktop, but the CPU is the fastest CPU I own because my home theater PC has an i3.

158
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,639
Rym: You can probably get away with playing.

159
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,696
Scott: My desktop has a Core 2 Duo and this has an i5.

160
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,460
Scott: Oh, yeah, I could definitely play Civ 4, Civ 5, but I can't play like, you know, any FPSs or anything.

161
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,686
Scott: Not that I would with a laptop.

162
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,152
Scott: You know, it's got three USBs.

163
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:20,295
Scott: It's real quiet.

164
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:21,860
Scott: It's got really fast networky.

165
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,808
Scott: It's got, you know, awesome wireless.

166
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:26,594
Scott: It's got a really nice screen.

167
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:28,780
Scott: Everything about it is pretty terrific.

168
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,351
Scott: And the thing is, right, I remembered two things that I forgot.

169
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:35,260
Scott: Number one, oh, three things I want to discuss.

170
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,660
Rym: Number one is that fanatical devotion to the pope.

171
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,019
Scott: Number one is that Thinkpads have a little light in the top.

172
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:42,320
Rym: Oh, I totally forgot about that.

173
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,420
Scott: I totally forgot about those, but Thinkpads have always had those and they still have them.

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
Rym: Because I used to have a Thinkpad at IBM.

175
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,619
Scott: Other laptops don't have them and really they should.

176
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,627
Rym: Well, I have a feeling going forward.

177
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:57,480
Rym: we're going to get to the point to where backlit keyboards will be the standard as opposed to the option.

178
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,762
Scott: Maybe.

179
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:04,980
Scott: The second thing is that the keyboard on this has a whole lot of buttons.

180
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,348
Scott: It's like, whoa, way more buttons than regular.

181
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:10,380
Scott: I mean, look, you don't even have like F keys integrated in the numbers.

182
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,950
Scott: They're separate F keys and everything.

183
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:13,400
Scott: There's a lot of buttons on this keyboard.

184
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:20,380
Scott: The thing is, like the keys are really good, but the like positioning is not so great.

185
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,319
Scott: It's like I had the escape key is way far away from my vintage.

186
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:27,260
Scott: So I learned that control left bracket is actually escape.

187
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:31,140
Scott: Oh, so now I'm like I'm re muscle memory.

188
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:35,820
Scott: So I always use control left bracket instead of pushing escape and when using them.

189
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:39,616
Scott: So that way I don't have to reach all all the way over to F1 by accident.

190
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,640
Scott: When you hit F1 by accident, it opens up the help, which is not what you want.

191
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:47,700
Rym: I mean, looking at my Fujitsu, you know, the boutique ultra portable.

192
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:54,100
Rym: The keys are in a perfect rectangle and the F keys are separate, but they're tiny keys in a line.

193
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,435
Scott: These are tiny, but in the line across the top.

194
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,099
Scott: But it's, you know.

195
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:02,240
Scott: Anyway, the other thing is that this came with Windows seven professional already installed.

196
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,260
Scott: All my other Windows sevens are home premium, but I didn't, you know, a premium professional was the only choice.

197
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,366
Scott: Not that it makes a difference.

198
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,000
Rym: And so that means you could theoretically use the XP mode if you wanted to.

199
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:12,949
Scott: Theoretically, I guess not that I would.

200
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,360
Rym: You could run a cool added pro.

201
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,465
Scott: I'll just use virtual.

202
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:17,834
Scott: I'll just use virtual box.

203
00:11:17,854 --> 00:11:17,975
Scott: Why?

204
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:18,820
Scott: Why would I anyway?

205
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Rym: Because it's basically pair virtualized as opposed to fully virtualized.

206
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,844
Scott: It doesn't matter.

207
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:23,450
Rym: That matters.

208
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,560
Rym: Huge performance difference.

209
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Scott: Yeah, but it's not not doing it for performance and doing if I'm doing virtualization, I'm doing it for, you know, virtualization and separation.

210
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,160
Rym: Well, the XP compatibility mode is primarily there for businesses who have like some old program.

211
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:37,419
Scott: I don't have any old program I need to run.

212
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:44,080
Scott: The thing I learned is that, number one, this doesn't have an optical drive, so it didn't come with any disks.

213
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,847
Scott: So how do I get like?

214
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:48,260
Scott: if I want to restore it to factory settings, how do I do that?

215
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,160
Scott: I got to plug in some sort of USB stick that's big enough and four gigs apparently wasn't big enough.

216
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:54,642
Scott: Right.

217
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:58,200
Scott: Or an external USB DVD ROM of some kind.

218
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:02,840
Scott: And you can there's a tool that lets you create the factory.

219
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:05,025
Scott: I have to do that.

220
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:10,940
Scott: And then there's like a factory restore partition on there also that I just left alone because it's so small.

221
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,683
Scott: I don't really care.

222
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:14,415
Scott: But it is annoying that they put that on there.

223
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:15,319
Scott: But I guess they have to.

224
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:15,540
Scott: Right.

225
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:20,580
Scott: But then the thing that really got me is just how much shit was pre-installed.

226
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:21,343
Scott: Right.

227
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:23,778
Scott: Like there was all sorts of Lenovo tools.

228
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:26,920
Scott: They installed on top of Windows.

229
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,440
Scott: Now, what was nice is that all these went to add or remove programs uninstalled and they went away, which was good.

230
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:34,362
Scott: Right.

231
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:37,640
Scott: The thing is, why are they on there in the first place?

232
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:47,520
Scott: I mean, some of them I could sort of understand, like there was one that like if you don't have the solid state drive, it, you know, controls the motion sensors to turn off your magnetic drive if you drop your laptop.

233
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,876
Scott: I could understand having a software tool for that and a driver for that.

234
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:51,460
Scott: That makes sense.

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,241
Scott: Right.

236
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:57,460
Scott: They also did some things that were just sort of, I guess, nice, depending on who you are, like they pre-installed flash.

237
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,147
Scott: So you don't have to go get it yourself.

238
00:12:59,228 --> 00:12:59,469
Scott: Right.

239
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,999
Scott: So I guess that's nice for someone who doesn't want to go.

240
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,234
Scott: It wasn't like they installed some hokey flash.

241
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:07,979
Scott: It was the real deal.

242
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,320
Scott: The thing is, they installed a bunch of other useless crap, like something that manages the wireless card.

243
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,622
Scott: It's like Windows already has that.

244
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:24,640
Scott: Why did you give me this really shitty GUI that removes the wireless thing from the taskbar, puts a big ugly wireless thing, a replacement in the taskbar.

245
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:25,620
Rym: That's what amazes me.

246
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,905
Scott: And just makes it a worse experience overall.

247
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:35,100
Scott: And they did the same thing for the battery, like the power icon was removed from Windows, all the Windows power stuff, and they put in their own power stuff.

248
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,644
Scott: Luckily, it uninstalled nicely.

249
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:37,346
Scott: Even with Fujitsu.

250
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:38,629
Scott: But why did they put it there?

251
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:40,413
Scott: It's not, I don't even care so much.

252
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,058
Scott: Why does it, why did they even write it?

253
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:42,820
Rym: Why does it even exist?

254
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,086
Rym: I don't care so much that they put it there.

255
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,680
Rym: Like that, like maybe they're stupid, whatever reason they would have put it there.

256
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,397
Rym: Why do they always make the icons for that stuff so fucking ugly?

257
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:52,100
Scott: And big.

258
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:54,875
Rym: I mean, they look like they're out of the Windows 95 era.

259
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,981
Scott: They're so horrendous.

260
00:13:57,362 --> 00:14:10,340
Scott: Really, if I was Microsoft, what I would do, right, is I would say, look, anyone who is shipping Windows pre-installed OEM on a computer, laptop or desktop, may not modify in any way whatsoever, except for these prescribed ways of modifying.

261
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:11,242
Scott: Right.

262
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:12,005
Scott: That is it.

263
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:14,391
Scott: You may not pre-install any driver.

264
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:17,620
Scott: You know, I mean, you know, obviously you have to have the drivers installed on there.

265
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:18,301
Scott: Right.

266
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:21,327
Scott: But you can't be installing like these separate gooeys and shit.

267
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:21,608
Scott: Right.

268
00:14:21,648 --> 00:14:22,510
Scott: Just the driver.

269
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,160
Scott: You know, they need to heavily regulate the OEMs and tell them what they can and cannot do.

270
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,013
Scott: I think it's because I think that what's happening is Windows is a bad reputation.

271
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,539
Scott: It's always had a bad reputation.

272
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:32,880
Scott: Right.

273
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:36,629
Scott: And I think the vast majority of its bad reputation comes from two things.

274
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,020
Scott: Number one, stupid people filling up their computers with viruses and spyware because they're morons.

275
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,543
Rym: Which not much you can do about that yet.

276
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:44,408
Scott: Not much you can do about that yet, really, you know.

277
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:47,777
Scott: And number two, OEMs putting all this shit on Windows.

278
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:48,900
Scott: that just makes it worse.

279
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,229
Scott: And Microsoft really should put the foot down and say, look, you cannot put this on here.

280
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:55,593
Scott: You must use the built in Windows wireless thing.

281
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:58,800
Scott: You can put the driver for the wireless card on there, obviously.

282
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:04,407
Scott: But you can't go replacing the Windows wireless card controlling interface with your own.

283
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:07,832
Rym: The landscape of the industry has changed significantly.

284
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:13,900
Rym: I mean, think to back in the day when someone would go to like CompUSA and buy a computer.

285
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:21,960
Rym: There were revenue streams along the way for, you know, a company to preload software that some other company paid them to do.

286
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,076
Scott: You pay compact to put the AOL icon on the desktop and AOL would get, you know, money because you signed up for AOL.

287
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,600
Scott: And compact would get money from AOL.

288
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:37,160
Rym: There was a time when Microsoft basically, if they fought that, it would have been something like they couldn't have fought it too much or they would have really hurt all the resellers.

289
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,003
Rym: I think now we're at the point.

290
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:43,254
Rym: Microsoft is powerful enough to tell all the OEMs, fuck you, get in line.

291
00:15:43,635 --> 00:15:45,519
Rym: And there's basically nothing they can do about it.

292
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,946
Scott: None of the things that were pre-installed were things that were going to make anyone money, right?

293
00:15:50,006 --> 00:15:58,680
Scott: It's not like they make more money if I use the Intel Lenovo wireless card, you know, access thing as opposed to the one that's built into Windows.

294
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,383
Scott: It's not like I'm signing up for anything.

295
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:03,248
Scott: They're not making any money on that whatsoever.

296
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:03,849
Scott: Zero.

297
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,330
Scott: Nothing.

298
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:09,980
Scott: There was not a single thing that was installed that was a money making deal like sign up for AOL or anything like that.

299
00:16:11,122 --> 00:16:12,587
Rym: Why do they even bother in the first place?

300
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:13,912
Rym: What is the addition here?

301
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:14,655
Rym: What do they do?

302
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,100
Rym: And why are they so ugly?

303
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:16,702
Scott: I don't know.

304
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:17,907
Scott: I don't know why they do it.

305
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:20,460
Scott: Even the worst part, they're paying someone to develop that.

306
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,582
Rym: My Fujitsu, right?

307
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:25,489
Rym: It came with, it had the window, Microsoft Windows power stuff works just fine.

308
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,719
Rym: It put another icon next to that, that did the same thing with an ugly Windows 311 interface.

309
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,775
Rym: And they had the software that turns off the hard drive and all that stuff, you know, that's the thing I wanted.

310
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:38,080
Rym: And that little software thing.

311
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,650
Scott: I don't even need it because I have solid state, but they put it on here anyway.

312
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,200
Rym: But it would show you like the pitch and yaw and all this information.

313
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,608
Rym: Then when service pack one came out, it just broke that.

314
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:52,600
Rym: And every time my laptop boots, it says no driver found for that thing.

315
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,250
Rym: And Fujitsu basically said, you know what, we're never going to make it fix.

316
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:56,872
Rym: We're done.

317
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:59,420
Rym: Your laptop is going to have this thing broken forever.

318
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,228
Scott: Yeah, well, at least, you know, what you could do, though, couldn't you just like?

319
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:08,079
Scott: if you just installed an actual clean windows that doesn't have any of their stuff in it at all, you wouldn't get the message, though.

320
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,665
Rym: Well, I'd have to turn off the service.

321
00:17:10,685 --> 00:17:16,259
Rym: I don't want to get into the details of it, but basically they broke one of the fundamental functionalities and never fixed it.

322
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,346
Scott: Anyway, that's just something I got to complain about.

323
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:30,965
Scott: And anyone out there, you know, if you have a bad impression of Windows or you know people have a bad impression of Windows, don't judge Windows.

324
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:37,200
Scott: unless you're judging the clean Microsoft pure windows directly from the desk with no extra bullshit on it.

325
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,066
Scott: That is the only thing that you can pass a valid judgment on.

326
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:45,700
Scott: if you're judging windows based on some spyware infested thing or you're judging windows.

327
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,040
Rym: If you're judging communism by one or two poor implementations.

328
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,885
Scott: I'm just listen.

329
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:52,511
Scott: All right.

330
00:17:52,812 --> 00:17:54,800
Scott: It's a totally different story.

331
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,359
Rym: Yes, if we just did it right from the start, it would work.

332
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:00,348
Scott: I'm not saying that Windows is like the greatest ever.

333
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:04,700
Scott: You know, I mean, you know, I hate all the OS's.

334
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:07,980
Scott: You know, I got something to hate about each and every one that's ever existed.

335
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,285
Scott: You know, it's funny.

336
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:12,700
Rym: It's the same thing with phones, with all the phone OS's and all the phone hardware.

337
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:18,760
Scott: Yeah, all the OS's are great and all the OS's suck, except OS X only sucks.

338
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:26,300
Rym: It's interesting, though, in the very least, something that sucks but doesn't have some sort of important redeeming quality fails immediately.

339
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:35,440
Rym: So all we're left in the situation where everything has one killer app you can't get anywhere else, coupled with one fatal flaw that is fixed everywhere else.

340
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,420
Scott: Yeah.

341
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:45,760
Scott: Why can't someone just it's like if one guy has the thing fixed, why can't you also have things that would be patents, patents, patents, patents, bullshit patents.

342
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,047
Scott: It's not all patent.

343
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:47,872
Rym: That's a big part of it.

344
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,120
Scott: We're going to talk about patents right now.

345
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,822
Rym: Yes, we are.

346
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:54,620
Rym: Let's get right into that, because I don't want to spend the whole show talking about stuff, because this is hopefully a good thing.

347
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:59,559
Rym: Back in the day, neuro-burning ROM was the almighty shit in the CD era.

348
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,459
Scott: Well, this isn't even the whole, this is like a sub-story here.

349
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,780
Scott: So the real, the big story is that, OK, we got the HTML5 video situation.

350
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,740
Scott: A bunch of people want to use H.264, but the open source people want to use like Ogg Fiora.

351
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,249
Scott: Thing is Ogg Fiora, technologically inferior.

352
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:21,078
Scott: H.264, patent encumbered.

353
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:21,640
Scott: What do you do?

354
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:22,122
Scott: Right.

355
00:19:22,684 --> 00:19:26,100
Scott: Some of them are using H.264, but Firefox ain't going to do that.

356
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,768
Rym: The worst thing is that most times when this has happened in history, all the normal people and a lot of the techs go the third way of.

357
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:42,940
Rym: they'll use the patent encumbered stuff semi-illegally and basically make it the defacto standard, which then forces anyone who wants to make software to sell to deal with the bullshit.

358
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,340
Scott: Yep.

359
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,760
Rym: Which is why we remember with GIF where nothing could legally use.

360
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,046
Scott: You don't even know the whole story.

361
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,040
Scott: You're like way, way off the full information's here.

362
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,106
Scott: So Google, right, bought that company that made like.

363
00:19:55,526 --> 00:20:04,700
Scott: they bought basically the other video codec company that had made the original codec that like Fiora was based off of, which was like version three or four or something like that.

364
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:14,020
Scott: And but then now they just at their Google I/O, they released like version, I think, eight or nine, like the newest best version of this, this, you know, codec that I forget the name of.

365
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,304
Scott: It's like on something like on nine or something like that anyway.

366
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:19,647
Scott: And they released it out.

367
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:24,853
Scott: They're like, here, here's, you know, the the the open source patent free, awesome video codec.

368
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:30,440
Scott: Let's let's rock with this one that's, you know, far technologically superior and is not patent encumbered.

369
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:38,640
Scott: So the thing is, there's now this whole, you know, thing it's like, OK, if you want to actually use this right now, you've got to install this WebM thing.

370
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,689
Scott: If you go to WebM project dot org, you can learn all about it.

371
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:45,480
Scott: You can install it in Firefox or whatever and all kinds of stuff.

372
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:48,932
Scott: The thing is, you know, people are still discussing.

373
00:20:48,972 --> 00:20:50,600
Scott: It's like, OK, you made this better codec.

374
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:59,800
Scott: The thing is, if I've got like a phone and I want to play some video, like the iPhone has a hardware H264 decoder in it, you know.

375
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:08,340
Scott: So if you're playing an H264 on an iPhone, it's going to be way better and it's going to use a lot less battery compared to even if you use this, you know, better codec.

376
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,206
Scott: That's not patent encumbered.

377
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:11,873
Scott: There's no hardware decoder for it.

378
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:13,319
Scott: And there's that whole situation.

379
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:13,580
Scott: Right.

380
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,745
Scott: So on top of that, right, there's the MPEG law.

381
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:25,680
Rym: Well, basically all that is, is a consortium of companies who all have basically they have contributed one or more patents to a pool.

382
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:32,280
Rym: And then collectively, they all share this pool of patents with a sort of not mutually assured destruction, but mutual.

383
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:37,699
Rym: We will not sue each other over patent infringement by agreeing to license these things all to each other.

384
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:39,625
Scott: And basically, it's not just that.

385
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:40,527
Scott: It's on top of that.

386
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:44,820
Scott: What they do is they charge people like a zillion dollars for the license.

387
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,121
Scott: Right.

388
00:21:45,141 --> 00:21:51,340
Scott: So if you want to use if you're making a Web browser and you want H264 in there, you have to pay to be in the MPEG law.

389
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:51,982
Scott: Right.

390
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:53,949
Scott: So basically they have this.

391
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:57,300
Scott: it's like a huge racket, basically, to where people pay.

392
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:58,362
Scott: They're in.

393
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:04,360
Scott: Then they have this huge interest in maintaining, you know, the MPEG law situation.

394
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,843
Scott: It's like once you're in, you're in.

395
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:13,120
Scott: And they're basically you can't use anything else because everyone who's in is going to is going to use the thing that they paid for or have.

396
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:14,584
Rym: Now, here's where it gets really bad.

397
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:20,380
Rym: The way the laws are, it really comes down to the fact that software patents are even what little of them we have.

398
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:34,020
Rym: An algorithmic patents are way too powerful and long lived because they have so many patents in the pool that if anyone competed with them, even if you in a you know what, you know, a clean environment built a brand new video codec.

399
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:40,960
Rym: The odds are you have at least on the surface level infringed upon one or more of their longstanding patents because a lot of the patents are generic bullshit.

400
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:45,800
Rym: So they basically have a complete monopoly and the power to destroy.

401
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,622
Scott: It's not a real.

402
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:49,874
Scott: it's like a weird legal monopoly, but it's not actually a monopoly.

403
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:51,199
Scott: It's not like every it's not like H.264.

404
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,839
Scott: I mean, it's a very popular video codec, but plenty of other video codecs are being used, you know, like Divix and all kinds of other MPEG-4 codecs.

405
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,220
Rym: Of course, remember, a lot of the MPEG-LA owns a lot of codecs.

406
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:03,641
Rym: They do.

407
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:06,332
Scott: But, you know, they don't have every single codec.

408
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:08,220
Scott: There are many codecs being used that are not there.

409
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,152
Scott: So they don't have like a physical monopoly, but they've got this legal monopoly, at least in the

410
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:12,593
Scott: U.S.,

411
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:14,880
Scott: to where you pretty much you're doing video.

412
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:19,920
Scott: If you're not doing some one of their stuff, then you're probably they can sue you.

413
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:25,860
Rym: Now, they have also claimed that Theora and a lot of other codecs that they don't have an interest in actually infringed upon all their patents.

414
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:29,412
Rym: And this is where Nero Burningrom has stepped in.

415
00:23:29,432 --> 00:23:31,220
Rym: I don't think they're actually called Nero.

416
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,566
Scott: They're called Nero AG.

417
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:35,340
Rym: Yeah, I just know them from their first greatest product.

418
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,529
Scott: Yeah, Nero is, you know, they're a pretty cool company.

419
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,000
Scott: I mean, they don't make, you know, too much open source stuff.

420
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,180
Scott: But they made Nero Burningrom, which is pretty much the only way to burn disks back in the day.

421
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:50,960
Scott: And the only reason they stopped using it is because all the operating systems sort of, the only time I ever used it was to burn an ISO, pretty much.

422
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,420
Rym: Or to burn, like, an overburn, which I don't need to do anymore.

423
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,580
Scott: You don't need to do that anymore, right?

424
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,438
Rym: Back in the day, I needed to.

425
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:56,941
Scott: Yeah.

426
00:23:57,243 --> 00:24:00,520
Scott: So their product, you know, these Nero Burningrom is no longer useful.

427
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:02,190
Scott: But I do remember, right, a lot.

428
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,800
Scott: They pretty much had all this great stuff.

429
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,920
Scott: Like if I played an MP3 in Nero, like it just sounded way better because they had way better MP3 decoders.

430
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,080
Rym: I forget what the codec was that they used, but it was some special one because I remember pulling it out and using it in something else.

431
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,380
Scott: It was like I could do a double blind test on it like every single time because there was just something they did that just.

432
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:20,881
Rym: Wow.

433
00:24:21,222 --> 00:24:21,924
Rym: I think I'm old.

434
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:23,509
Rym: I actually forgot the names of all.

435
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:27,060
Rym: Remember back there's the front offer like reference and then there are all these kind of other ones.

436
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:27,461
Rym: Yep.

437
00:24:27,562 --> 00:24:29,049
Rym: Because Lame used one and something.

438
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,336
Rym: It's all gone.

439
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,059
Rym: I'm old.

440
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,879
Scott: It's disappeared from my brain.

441
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:40,220
Scott: And then they made like Nero Burningrom for Linux in the days when burning a disk on Linux is really painful, you know, and I don't know what they're doing now.

442
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,044
Rym: Well, here's what they're doing now.

443
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:46,100
Rym: They've filed a straight up full on antitrust complaint against the MPEG LA.

444
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:46,747
Scott: Yeah.

445
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:47,460
Scott: Take that, bitches.

446
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,437
Rym: And they're basically saying.

447
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,239
Rym: Nero coming out of the booth.

448
00:24:49,560 --> 00:25:01,120
Rym: Exactly what Scott said, that the MPEG LA has this kind of weird loophole legal monopoly that is preventing anyone else from competing in the market whatsoever.

449
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,490
Rym: And this is probably, you know, it might seem like a little thing like, all right, some people are fighting over these video codecs.

450
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,960
Rym: If this goes our way, few things do in the courts, guys, but if this goes our way, this is one of those game changers.

451
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,760
Rym: This should be like DMCA getting repealed.

452
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:17,563
Scott: Yeah.

453
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:22,180
Scott: Like Internet videos would be like, oh, snap, videos in the house, all those situations.

454
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:25,740
Scott: Like, you know, you have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get all your video codecs in line.

455
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:26,644
Scott: Right.

456
00:25:26,665 --> 00:25:28,180
Rym: That's because of this bullshit.

457
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,460
Rym: Yeah.

458
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:34,780
Scott: If Nero like wins this, then basically like every video player will play every kind of video.

459
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:37,460
Scott: You know, that's that's the best possible situation.

460
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:38,600
Scott: I'm not saying that's going to happen.

461
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,320
Scott: Here's the best possible case.

462
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,700
Scott: There might be a court ruling that's like every Linux can just come with every video codec installed.

463
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:50,900
Scott: You know, your every video player will play every video file, every audio file, just totally awesomely.

464
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:55,179
Scott: You won't have to install any weird stuff, no hoop jumping, no nothing.

465
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:59,380
Scott: You'll be able to have streaming video of any kind going to any device.

466
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:00,435
Scott: It'll be frickin crazy.

467
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:00,780
Scott: Awesome.

468
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:01,543
Rym: I'll say this.

469
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:02,446
Scott: This is the.

470
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:05,840
Scott: this is one barrier to that to reaching that golden paradise.

471
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:10,020
Rym: I have three kind of levels of optimism in terms of my prediction of what will happen.

472
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:16,300
Scott: I guess starting at the top, most likely Nero loses because they don't have as much money as everyone else combined.

473
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,900
Rym: Well, that aside, because, you know, because the MPEG law is everyone else combined, right?

474
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,740
Scott: It's Microsoft and Apple and Daylou and everyone, everybody.

475
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:37,299
Rym: But like one thing that could happen, and this is kind of the the most likely optimistic outcome I have, is that the courts would install or enforce some sort of statutory royalty to where the MPEG L.A.

476
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,640
Rym: could continue to force people to license, but it would have a statutory royalty that they would have no control over.

477
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,700
Rym: That would be much lower, which I could live with that.

478
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,206
Rym: That's kind of the status quo.

479
00:26:47,246 --> 00:26:48,090
Rym: You know, don't rock the boat.

480
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,340
Scott: The thing is, even the one dollar royalty.

481
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,960
Rym: So, so, so, so, so too much is going to fix a less likely, more optimistic outcome.

482
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,820
Rym: Statutory royalties based on the sale price of whatever it is you're selling.

483
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:12,899
Scott: That'd be good, because if it's if it's not zero, right, then, you know, Firefox and whatever, you know, even if it's even even if it is zero, if it's not open source, Firefox and Linux's distributions might not include it.

484
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:20,020
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, the non gnu neckbeard distros would if it was completely free and guaranteed and protected by law.

485
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:20,680
Scott: Yeah.

486
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,980
Rym: But, you know, statutory royalty based on cost be something I could.

487
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:36,800
Rym: But the real what we really need, but I basically have zero optimism for this whatsoever, is that I think the biggest hindrance to incremental improvement in all technology today is the fact that patents are too powerful.

488
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:43,740
Rym: And basically software and evolved so quickly that, all right, someone makes a slightly better codec.

489
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:48,534
Rym: If they can't step on the shoulders of the previous codecs, you know, take the MPEG L.A.

490
00:27:48,654 --> 00:27:50,520
Rym: own stuff and incrementally improve it.

491
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,800
Rym: Everyone who has a good idea has to either pay out the nose, join the racket or start from scratch.

492
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,161
Scott: Right.

493
00:27:56,181 --> 00:27:57,128
Scott: Well, think about think about it.

494
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:58,619
Scott: this way is is a good analogy.

495
00:27:58,679 --> 00:27:58,820
Scott: Right.

496
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,765
Scott: So I'm making a car.

497
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:01,152
Scott: No, I say I'm making tires.

498
00:28:01,494 --> 00:28:01,735
Scott: Right.

499
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:02,760
Scott: I'm Michelin.

500
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,419
Rym: Oh, but I got the patent on a round.

501
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:05,543
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

502
00:28:05,604 --> 00:28:05,905
Scott: Right.

503
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:09,155
Scott: Because, you know, the thing is, the wheel is such an old invention.

504
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:10,178
Scott: The patent is expired.

505
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:10,660
Scott: Right.

506
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,980
Rym: So so if I may realize if Thog were still alive and he had sold those rights to Disney would be fucked.

507
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,240
Rym: Right.

508
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,610
Scott: So there's a way we'd have square tires on our Linux mobile on the wheel has expired.

509
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:23,640
Scott: So if I make like all sorts of different wheels.

510
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:24,362
Scott: Right.

511
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:29,600
Scott: That improve upon, you know, the default wheel or tire in various ways, the patent on the tire even.

512
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:32,648
Scott: Why did you do you hit me in the nose?

513
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:33,511
Rym: I bang down.

514
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:34,053
Rym: I'm sorry.

515
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:36,100
Scott: Don't do that anyway.

516
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,448
Rym: So we had an accident in the studio.

517
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:43,180
Scott: Even the patent on the tire is so even the tire much newer than the wheel.

518
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:43,540
Scott: Right.

519
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:45,203
Scott: It's so old that it's expired.

520
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:56,440
Scott: So I can make all sorts of tires and improve upon the you know, the invention of tire in many ways without having to worry about patent infringement, you know, because it's just it's wide open.

521
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:01,112
Scott: Now, imagine if the tire straight up was invented like five years ago.

522
00:29:01,514 --> 00:29:03,920
Scott: and I'm sitting here making improvements on the tire.

523
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:04,581
Scott: Right.

524
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:08,332
Scott: Because the tire was just invented, that hasn't expired yet.

525
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:11,080
Scott: So pretty much only one person in the world can make tires.

526
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:13,699
Scott: Or if I want to make tires, I have to pay them a boatload of money.

527
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:23,620
Scott: When, you know, patents were made in a time where the rate of invention was very it was relatively slow to what it is now, to where all the fundamental inventions were very old.

528
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:37,380
Scott: And the problem is computer science is so new, relatively speaking, programming is so new, software is so new that patents on these fundamental things like the tire of programming are still in effect.

529
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,760
Rym: The Amazon one click.

530
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,460
Scott: Yeah.

531
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:39,981
Scott: Right.

532
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:48,540
Scott: So there are these fundamental things to software that are pretty much in all software that are still patented and is bullshit.

533
00:29:49,101 --> 00:30:03,100
Scott: And the thing is, I think this the if you're going to even argue that patents should even exist for software or for anything or for whatever, the thing is, if nothing else, the time of a patent needs to be relative to the rate of invention.

534
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:03,703
Scott: Right.

535
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:07,120
Scott: If we are making improvements upon things on a daily basis.

536
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:08,123
Scott: Right.

537
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:10,559
Scott: Then a patent really just be a few hours.

538
00:30:11,512 --> 00:30:11,720
Scott: Right.

539
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:19,920
Scott: You know, if it takes a week to bring something to market and then something's obsolete a month after that, then a patent should be a month and a week.

540
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:24,939
Scott: You know, and the thing is, patents are still what, 17 years, I think they're there.

541
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,040
Rym: They're so long that basically if I get a pet, if I got a patent on some fundamental, like say I come up, there's a new video codec and I have the patent on it.

542
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,620
Scott: That video codec will be useful for maybe two or three years.

543
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,614
Rym: And then after that, for the next 15 years or so.

544
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,478
Scott: You're just obstructing the entire world into having shitty video for 14 years.

545
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,180
Rym: No one but me can take the thing I invented and perform what I think is obvious incremental improvement.

546
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,640
Rym: So and this I think this is one of the most far reaching issues in technology today.

547
00:30:52,940 --> 00:31:03,880
Scott: Something else we can do is you can make an exception to where it's like, if you improve upon something that's patented, then, you know, if you just reuse something that's patented.

548
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:04,243
Scott: Right.

549
00:31:04,283 --> 00:31:06,700
Scott: Like, OK, you made MPEG.

550
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:07,502
Scott: Right.

551
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:10,960
Scott: And I took MPEG and I just included it straight up in my shit.

552
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,123
Scott: No, no, no, no, no, no.

553
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:18,400
Scott: But maybe if I take your MPEG and I make it better, then your patent doesn't mean shit because I made your shit better.

554
00:31:18,822 --> 00:31:20,180
Rym: I thought about the same idea.

555
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:33,260
Rym: Imagine if you applied it to just straight up copyright, not just patents, with the idea that, for example, like duplicating someone's work in its entirety with no substantial change and then just reselling it or whatever were still illegal for some short period of time.

556
00:31:33,702 --> 00:31:36,380
Rym: But remixing, mashing up parody and all that.

557
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:47,400
Scott: The thing is, the only problem with this is you get the mega time, mega two, mega two, mega two situation where everybody will you read just infringe everyone else's patents and copyrights, but crook them slightly so.

558
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:53,920
Rym: But at the same time, if they can be crook slightly so, then there's probably the patent is a little too fundamental.

559
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:55,826
Scott: I don't know.

560
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:56,859
Rym: It's hard to say.

561
00:31:57,965 --> 00:31:59,160
Rym: I really don't know the solution.

562
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:10,100
Rym: All I know is that I wish Nero the best of luck because I can't not overstate how impactful this would be on the world if they won or even if there was a compromise.

563
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,677
Rym: There was 90 percent against them.

564
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:12,541
Scott: Yep.

565
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:20,840
Scott: But anyway, the the the fight over the future of video on computers is like full on.

566
00:32:21,403 --> 00:32:23,880
Scott: And it's right now it's Nero versus the world.

567
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,839
Rym: I feel ready to take out the world.

568
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:33,720
Rym: Oh, and Google TV, but there's not enough info to really say much about it yet.

569
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:41,840
Scott: So the one thing that is interesting about Google TV is that, you know, if it's built into your TV, then you don't have the one extra box problem.

570
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,321
Scott: Right.

571
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:53,300
Scott: And what what Google TV seems to be able to do is you could hook in your cable and your DVR and your boxy and whatever other video, your Netflix and whatever other video sources you've got.

572
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:54,222
Scott: Right.

573
00:32:54,282 --> 00:33:03,340
Scott: And then you can just instead of ever changing channels or specifically picking videos to play or anything like that, all you would do is turn on your TV and search for what you want to watch.

574
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,240
Scott: So if you want to watch Hokuto no Ken, you would turn on your TV and you type in Hokuto no Ken.

575
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:18,620
Scott: And if it found any Hokuto no Ken on your DVR, on Crunchyroll, on YouTube, on any anywhere, it would bring it up and you'd pick one and it would play.

576
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,241
Scott: And that's what.

577
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:25,877
Scott: so that basically it changes your TV by aggregating all your video sources and then allowing you to search.

578
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,300
Scott: it sort of like desktop does.

579
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,540
Scott: And that's that's Google TV now independently.

580
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,266
Scott: Logitech sort of does this.

581
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:35,079
Scott: And I think Google TV would actually be a good like front end on the boxy.

582
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,859
Scott: You know, if you just open a boxy and you just searched and then played.

583
00:33:38,442 --> 00:33:40,540
Rym: Yeah, well, it's hard to say what's going to happen with the boxy and everything.

584
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:47,220
Rym: I think who's really interested in this is remember when Hulu blocked boxy because they don't want people to actually use the Internet to watch TV.

585
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:55,100
Rym: I think basically I think what Google TV is going to do now, we don't have enough details to know exactly like what video formats does it really support?

586
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,042
Rym: What does it really do?

587
00:33:56,664 --> 00:34:01,540
Rym: Logitech's making a box that'll basically let anyone use it if they don't have one of these Google TVs.

588
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:09,860
Rym: Yeah, but this could be the device that basically is the death knell of cable TV for most techie people and young people.

589
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,663
Scott: Well, I hope right.

590
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:13,779
Scott: The thing is, it seems like a lot of people are probably going to still have cable and DVR.

591
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,893
Scott: They're just never going to watch channels.

592
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:16,780
Scott: They're just going to search.

593
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:24,239
Scott: So if it's time to watch Super Bowl, right, you go to your TV type Super Bowl and you push enter and then he just turns on the channel, whatever channel it is on that year.

594
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:25,143
Scott: And there you go.

595
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:28,060
Scott: People aren't going to flick through the channels anymore.

596
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:28,699
Scott: Right.

597
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:37,400
Rym: And also a lot of people, I mean, more people in our generation, I think studies show more and more dropping cable entirely because idle entertainment is trivially found on the Internet forever.

598
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Scott: But hopefully what this will do is more people will, you know, the problem is, is that right now you can plug your computer into your TV for awesome, but not enough people do it.

599
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,027
Rym: And it's not super easy.

600
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:51,280
Rym: It's not drop in place for grandma to do it.

601
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,206
Scott: Well, some of it is, depending on what box you get.

602
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,491
Scott: Like if you do a Roku, it is.

603
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,180
Scott: But if you do like a computer like I have, it's not.

604
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,500
Rym: But it's not like the Roku is great for Netflix and all that stuff.

605
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,980
Scott: An Apple TV is, but it's useless.

606
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:02,522
Scott: Yeah.

607
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:05,453
Rym: I think multiple articles basically said the Google TV versus Apple TV.

608
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,239
Scott: The boxy box is not out yet.

609
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:08,780
Rym: Yep.

610
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:10,263
Rym: But we'll see.

611
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:18,039
Rym: Google, they have a reputation for coming out with cool things like this and making it 80 percent there and then just not finishing it.

612
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,320
Scott: That's pretty much everything.

613
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,121
Rym: Yep.

614
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:24,776
Rym: But lately they've been getting to like 85 percent with things like Google Apps.

615
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:26,080
Rym: So we'll see.

616
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:29,269
Rym: It's like 82 percent, maybe.

617
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:29,671
Rym: We'll see.

618
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:31,600
Rym: There's not enough information to say for sure.

619
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:39,200
Rym: But Google TV, for if it does what it what we think it may do will be a game changer between that and boxy.

620
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,159
Rym: That's going to scare a lot of the old.

621
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Scott: I hope they give Google TV out for like free as software so I can just install it on a computer.

622
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:46,781
Scott: Right.

623
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:53,720
Scott: The way I install boxy, I could foresee them doing or they make up like maybe I can if they have an API for it, I can make a boxy app for Google TV.

624
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,540
Scott: Because the boxy guys said that like Google TV, they see it as complimentary, which I totally agree with.

625
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,560
Rym: Well, Logitech and Sony, I believe, are smart.

626
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,879
Rym: Sony will sell their new OLED TV with Google TV built into it.

627
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:09,840
Rym: And the people who will buy that TV are not the people who would go buy some separate box.

628
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:10,363
Scott: Yep.

629
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,860
Rym: So that market, they'll basically make money anyway.

630
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,486
Scott: The thing is, they've got to set it up.

631
00:36:14,526 --> 00:36:17,240
Scott: so we turn on the TV and the Google thing like comes out at you.

632
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:17,461
Scott: Right.

633
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:18,508
Scott: Because like, look at your TV.

634
00:36:18,528 --> 00:36:20,340
Scott: Your TV has some Internet Yahoo widget thing.

635
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:20,541
Scott: Right.

636
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:20,722
Scott: Yep.

637
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:23,640
Scott: But that doesn't just come out at you when you turn the TV on.

638
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,539
Scott: You have to actually do a bunch of stuff to make it appear if you even know it's there.

639
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,839
Rym: It's also slow as shit.

640
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:28,501
Scott: Yeah.

641
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,604
Scott: So the Google.

642
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:29,845
Scott: Right.

643
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:34,840
Scott: What they've got to do is they've got to make it so that if you have a TV with Google TV, it has to be a Google TV.

644
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,715
Scott: Like you turn the TV on and there's the fucking search box.

645
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:38,037
Scott: Boom.

646
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:38,640
Scott: Right up top.

647
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:41,400
Scott: You know, like as soon as you turn it on, it's good.

648
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:41,941
Scott: Right.

649
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:44,807
Scott: And the thing is, I think they'll actually get a lot of.

650
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:50,320
Scott: they're not competing with anyone, really, because what it does is it doesn't actually have any video sources of its own.

651
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,301
Scott: Other than the Internet.

652
00:36:51,602 --> 00:36:51,822
Scott: Right.

653
00:36:52,323 --> 00:37:04,080
Scott: So what it does, it brings in all these video sources the way that Boxy does, you know, is like greatest fear of the current content generation regime, because basically there's so much free content out there.

654
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:09,857
Rym: If it's all aggregated and easy to get, that really hurts their bottom line in a huge way.

655
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:14,340
Scott: I think it's just another example of the middlemen being eliminated.

656
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:14,682
Scott: Right.

657
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:18,820
Scott: Because you've got TV networks like some TV station, some cable network.

658
00:37:19,301 --> 00:37:24,240
Scott: They buy productions from some, you know, production company that's making TV shows.

659
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:28,940
Scott: Then they put it on TV with some ads and people buy ads even if no one's watching.

660
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:29,582
Scott: Right.

661
00:37:29,903 --> 00:37:34,400
Scott: Whereas now, if you remove the middleman of the network, it's just people watching videos direct.

662
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:35,302
Scott: Right.

663
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:41,340
Scott: Then it's pretty much all these production companies who make shitty shows, but managed to survive by selling them to networks.

664
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,081
Scott: They're going to die.

665
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:43,484
Scott: The networks are going to die.

666
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:52,920
Scott: And pretty much the only people left are going to be the consumers, the tech companies who are providing the technological services because the, you know, and the production companies can't do it themselves.

667
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:57,293
Scott: And the production companies who actually make shows that people actually watch.

668
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:57,936
Scott: And that's going to be it.

669
00:37:58,016 --> 00:37:59,039
Scott: Everyone else is going to be dead.

670
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,520
Scott: It's the same in every entertainment industry.

671
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:16,360
Rym: The reason I think that they're going to let the software be free is that Logitech, you know, the people who would sell the boxes, I don't think the people who would use it on their own computer and then install it are competing for the same demographic as the people who will just buy the Logitech box and put it down.

672
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,020
Rym: Logitech box is for mom or for me because I don't really feel like building an HDPC maybe.

673
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,521
Rym: Maybe.

674
00:38:21,763 --> 00:38:25,258
Rym: But I already have a bunch of PCs, so maybe I'll just throw it on my Mac or something.

675
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:25,619
Rym: I don't know.

676
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:27,844
Scott: Something else that's interesting.

677
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:34,960
Scott: I was reading about, you know, how it's pretty annoying that, like, all the Android phones are sort of like different versions and you can't upgrade them and all this kind of stuff.

678
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:40,857
Scott: Basically, I read and the reason for this isn't because, you know, you think, oh, it's because Google's lazy, whatever.

679
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:41,118
Scott: Right.

680
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:41,760
Scott: But really, no.

681
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,285
Scott: What it is, is that Google just keeps improving Android constantly.

682
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:54,500
Scott: They keep upgrading and upgrading and upgrading and upgrading and upgrading all the time, constantly thinking about how many new versions have come out in such a short time versus how long it took like a new version of Windows Mobile to come out.

683
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:54,860
Scott: Right.

684
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:58,828
Scott: And the thing is, it's not like Windows Mobile.

685
00:38:58,848 --> 00:39:03,877
Scott: If I'm a phone carrier, if I'm a phone maker, I license Windows Mobile to put it on my phones.

686
00:39:04,197 --> 00:39:04,357
Scott: Right.

687
00:39:04,398 --> 00:39:05,700
Scott: I'm paying Microsoft for this.

688
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:14,636
Scott: So, you know, it's up to Microsoft to, like, make sure the shit works and everything so I can upgrade and whatnot because I'm paying them with Android.

689
00:39:14,696 --> 00:39:16,239
Scott: It's just like you just get it for free.

690
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:16,920
Scott: It's open source.

691
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,681
Scott: It's just out there.

692
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:18,182
Scott: If you're you can.

693
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:27,900
Scott: just if I start a phone company and I just start making phones from like, you know, I'm basically soldering soldering together old Nokias to soldering, not soldering soldering.

694
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,081
Scott: Oh, no.

695
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:31,025
Scott: I just start making phones in my garage.

696
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:34,170
Scott: I can just put Android on them without giving Google a second look.

697
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:34,511
Scott: Right.

698
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:39,580
Scott: But then it's up to me to make my phones have all the newer androids on it.

699
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,168
Scott: And the thing is, the shitty phone makers and shitty phone carriers can't keep up.

700
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:45,029
Scott: Right.

701
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,193
Scott: So some of them are better than others.

702
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:50,698
Scott: Like HTC is better at keeping up, you know, than you see.

703
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:51,580
Rym: I just I like them.

704
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,081
Scott: Yeah.

705
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:54,925
Scott: But, you know, like Samsung, they can't keep the fuck up.

706
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:55,986
Scott: They just suck ass.

707
00:39:56,187 --> 00:40:01,715
Scott: They can't you know, the Google keeps updating the phone and Samsung keeps updating Android and Samsung.

708
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:05,340
Scott: We can't oh, we can't keep up with all these Android updates because we suck so bad.

709
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,262
Scott: That's the reason.

710
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,704
Scott: Don't blame Google for this.

711
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:10,149
Scott: Google's actually just upgrading as fast as possible.

712
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:12,493
Scott: It's the phone makers and the phone carriers.

713
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:13,194
Scott: You can't keep up.

714
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:16,460
Scott: And I see the same thing in like the HTC area.

715
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:25,807
Rym: Well, that went on for a while.

716
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:30,752
Rym: So I guess things of the day, about half the people I run into knew this.

717
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:31,632
Rym: The other half didn't.

718
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:33,774
Rym: So you guys have a 50 50 shot.

719
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:34,555
Rym: I did not know.

720
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:40,520
Rym: Mark Twain said that 100 years after his death, his autobiography, which was in escrow, should be published.

721
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,623
Rym: And it's now been 100 years.

722
00:40:42,703 --> 00:40:43,063
Scott: Right.

723
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:43,564
Scott: OK.

724
00:40:43,924 --> 00:40:46,107
Scott: They put it in escrow, but they didn't have to.

725
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:48,250
Scott: They didn't have to obey him for 100 years.

726
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,332
Scott: Well, they could have chose to not obey.

727
00:40:50,352 --> 00:40:51,214
Rym: Now, here's the thing.

728
00:40:51,474 --> 00:40:56,340
Rym: Had someone had the person who had it just released it against Mark Twain's wishes.

729
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,283
Rym: I would not have faulted him because I would never.

730
00:40:58,344 --> 00:41:01,790
Rym: I will never fault someone morally for revealing truth.

731
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:07,260
Rym: But at the same time, if he chose not to reveal it, I will not fault him because he did honor the wish.

732
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:07,460
Rym: Oh, yeah.

733
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:08,683
Scott: I'm saying they had to do it.

734
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:10,265
Scott: I'm saying they didn't have to not.

735
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:18,100
Rym: I'm saying it's interesting that I don't I wouldn't fault someone either way, nor would I fault the third party who broke in, stole it and revealed it.

736
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,601
Scott: Well, it was stealing.

737
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:21,743
Scott: property doesn't belong to you.

738
00:41:21,763 --> 00:41:28,531
Scott: But at the same time, revealing truth through investigative reporting, investigative reporting doesn't include breaking and entering and stealing.

739
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:29,512
Rym: What what?

740
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:30,813
Rym: what if it wasn't breaking and entering?

741
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:33,897
Rym: It was digital breaking and not even breaking just digital copying.

742
00:41:34,017 --> 00:41:36,540
Scott: Did they physically enter property that was not theirs?

743
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,180
Rym: Let's say no.

744
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:42,424
Rym: But they did trespass to Chateau's by breaking into like an email server, but they didn't cause any harm.

745
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:43,785
Rym: They just copied.

746
00:41:43,825 --> 00:41:46,467
Scott: See what they would have to do to to make it totally kosher.

747
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:46,748
Scott: Right.

748
00:41:47,128 --> 00:41:47,388
Scott: Is that?

749
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:53,973
Scott: use X-ray vision to see into the vault, read it and then type it into a computer while sitting out in the public street.

750
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:54,774
Scott: That would.

751
00:41:55,314 --> 00:42:01,579
Rym: that would be because there's legal precedent that if it's like, for example, I can take a picture of your house and you have to be naked in the window.

752
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:02,039
Rym: Fuck you.

753
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,360
Rym: I can do whatever I want with that picture.

754
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:10,785
Rym: If I take a picture of your house through the window into your bedroom with a telephoto lens, not cool because you had a reasonable expectation of privacy.

755
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:12,406
Rym: So the inside of the safe.

756
00:42:12,466 --> 00:42:14,748
Scott: Do you have a reasonable expectation of privacy?

757
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:19,891
Rym: If everyone has X-ray vision, but not everyone does yet.

758
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:23,494
Scott: Anyway, my thing is real quick.

759
00:42:23,534 --> 00:42:27,476
Scott: Do you remember this flash game called the the codex of chemical engineering?

760
00:42:27,536 --> 00:42:31,119
Rym: Yeah, it was basically teach kids the cool fun parts of coding version one.

761
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:32,820
Scott: Yeah, there's another game out.

762
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,441
Scott: It's called Manufactoria.

763
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:38,324
Scott: It's a lot less subtle than the codex of chemical engineering.

764
00:42:38,464 --> 00:42:40,945
Scott: It's pretty much like, hey, kids, Turing machines, check it out.

765
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:44,728
Scott: But it's a good game and it's good Turing machines and you'll learn something.

766
00:42:44,908 --> 00:42:45,989
Scott: So play this game.

767
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:48,130
Rym: So I don't know how long we'll talk about this.

768
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,672
Rym: Scott has a lot more direct experience with it than I do, though.

769
00:42:51,052 --> 00:42:53,374
Rym: I've played with CouchDB quite a bit.

770
00:42:54,334 --> 00:43:02,820
Rym: Basically, we want to talk about, you know, when people think databases, at least tech people, they think things like Postgres or MSSQL or.

771
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:10,486
Rym: Oracle or DB to, you know, they think of relational databases, which for most people, if you think database, you think relational database.

772
00:43:10,786 --> 00:43:12,728
Rym: That is what a database is in most people's minds.

773
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:13,148
Scott: Yep.

774
00:43:13,688 --> 00:43:19,853
Scott: But nowadays it's been really trendy lately to go with the non SQL databases.

775
00:43:19,873 --> 00:43:22,235
Scott: You know, there's some of them are key value stores.

776
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:24,597
Scott: Some of them are documented oriented databases.

777
00:43:24,637 --> 00:43:28,780
Scott: So, you know, they go by many different names, but no SQL is like the trendy term.

778
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,140
Rym: Yeah.

779
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:35,624
Scott: I mean, even though it's sort of it's an accurate term, though, because I've seen some of these that actually can work with SQL, even though they're not relational.

780
00:43:36,085 --> 00:43:37,145
Scott: You just can't do a join.

781
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,427
Rym: I mean, you can go all the way down to like an LDAP.

782
00:43:39,447 --> 00:43:41,168
Rym: That's literally just a flat CSV.

783
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,209
Rym: And then you exactly.

784
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:42,449
Scott: All right.

785
00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:43,570
Scott: So this is the first thing, right?

786
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,911
Scott: These are way trendy lately.

787
00:43:44,931 --> 00:43:45,331
Scott: All right.

788
00:43:45,371 --> 00:43:46,912
Scott: All these no SQL databases.

789
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:50,775
Scott: But the thing is, the original databases weren't relational.

790
00:43:50,815 --> 00:43:54,377
Scott: They were flat databases is basically a blast from the past.

791
00:43:54,437 --> 00:43:54,597
Scott: Right.

792
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:55,398
Scott: It's like they made.

793
00:43:55,658 --> 00:43:58,180
Scott: we finally got to the point where we can make relational databases.

794
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:58,640
Scott: And we're like, yes.

795
00:43:59,620 --> 00:43:59,940
Rym: Awesome.

796
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,862
Rym: Kind of like object oriented programing was a whole new paradigm.

797
00:44:02,902 --> 00:44:06,705
Scott: Now, now people are like, oh, yeah, these relational databases.

798
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:10,808
Scott: It's so hard to replicate with them, you know, even though it's kind of.

799
00:44:10,868 --> 00:44:13,130
Scott: it's not that hard, but it's harder than it could be.

800
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:13,750
Scott: Right.

801
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:19,174
Scott: And oh, you know, I don't actually need this relational bits or oh, my Web site is hard to scale.

802
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:21,235
Scott: You know, the database is totally getting crushed.

803
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:22,736
Scott: You know, what do I do?

804
00:44:23,257 --> 00:44:27,860
Scott: You know, so they go back and they've made basically these modern non relational databases.

805
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,141
Scott: They're like the databases of old, but they're new.

806
00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:31,823
Scott: And the replication is easy.

807
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,444
Scott: The load balancing is easy.

808
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,585
Scott: The partitioning is easy in many cases.

809
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:44,231
Scott: And the other thing is that many of them are schema lists, which is very, very useful for many, many applications of the modern days is not having a schema at all.

810
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:45,412
Scott: All right.

811
00:44:45,772 --> 00:44:53,177
Scott: So the first thing that bothers me right is some of the people who are like zealoty about these no SQL databases.

812
00:44:53,197 --> 00:44:54,938
Rym: That's just silly.

813
00:44:55,078 --> 00:44:55,418
Rym: Yeah.

814
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:56,719
Scott: For example, right.

815
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:57,820
Scott: Some people will be like, OK.

816
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:58,801
Scott: My SQL.

817
00:44:58,841 --> 00:44:59,461
Scott: Yeah, yeah.

818
00:44:59,481 --> 00:45:00,322
Scott: My SQL sucks.

819
00:45:00,402 --> 00:45:00,782
Scott: Why?

820
00:45:01,102 --> 00:45:08,707
Scott: Well, because if you use my SQL in the default mode with the default engine of my ISAM, then you don't get any of the foreign key constraints.

821
00:45:08,787 --> 00:45:09,228
Scott: And it's all.

822
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:10,428
Scott: it's not acid compliant.

823
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:11,849
Scott: And you might it might screw up.

824
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,210
Rym: And let's translate that.

825
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:19,154
Rym: If you take a product off the shelf, make no customizations and don't read the documentation and don't configure it.

826
00:45:19,454 --> 00:45:22,016
Rym: It doesn't perform exactly what you might have wanted it to do.

827
00:45:22,296 --> 00:45:27,880
Scott: No, no, it's not even that it will perform exactly what you want it to do, but it won't be super hard core for database people.

828
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,600
Scott: They won't like it.

829
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:30,642
Rym: Well, those people shouldn't be using my SQL anyway.

830
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:35,285
Scott: But if you use my SQL in a DB mode, right, then it will do all those things.

831
00:45:35,345 --> 00:45:38,007
Scott: just as you know, it's acid compliant and totally awesome.

832
00:45:38,547 --> 00:45:41,289
Scott: But it'll be slow, but it won't be slow.

833
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:44,151
Scott: It is be slower than the non acid compliant mode.

834
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:44,671
Scott: Right.

835
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:47,573
Scott: And it'll basically be as fast as Postgres is.

836
00:45:48,154 --> 00:45:48,414
Scott: Right.

837
00:45:48,654 --> 00:45:51,796
Scott: But the thing is, so these hard core people like, oh, you got to use Postgres.

838
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:52,857
Scott: Postgres is for real.

839
00:45:53,457 --> 00:45:53,717
Scott: Right.

840
00:45:54,097 --> 00:45:57,880
Scott: And the thing is, I used to be like, yeah, OK, Postgres is for real and my SQL isn't for real.

841
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,440
Scott: You know what?

842
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:05,305
Scott: I have yet to find someone who can actually explain to me why Postgres is for real and my SQL is not.

843
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:11,449
Scott: If you use my SQL, if you really need your data to be for real, then you can use the my SQL in the slow mode.

844
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:15,091
Scott: It'll be easier to use because Postgres is wicked user unfriendly.

845
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:15,952
Rym: That's for sure.

846
00:46:16,052 --> 00:46:16,392
Rym: Right.

847
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:27,820
Scott: It'll be easier to replicate because my SQL slaving is way better than Postgres, even though the newest newest newest version of Postgres that might be coming soon apparently makes the slavings.

848
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,142
Rym: Yeah, I'm running the beta on my windows box.

849
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:30,882
Rym: I've been playing with it.

850
00:46:31,162 --> 00:46:31,362
Scott: Nice.

851
00:46:32,063 --> 00:46:33,304
Rym: So you can even do like.

852
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:41,349
Rym: as an example, you know, just to give a specific concrete in my SQL is actually very easy to set up master master two way replication.

853
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:43,471
Rym: You can have two database really want to do that.

854
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,272
Rym: Well, there are situations where you might want to.

855
00:46:45,312 --> 00:46:48,134
Rym: However, you got to know what the fuck you're doing or you're just going to make a mess.

856
00:46:48,174 --> 00:46:49,755
Scott: But master slave is way easy.

857
00:46:49,795 --> 00:46:55,559
Scott: And most of the time, even if you don't need to scale or anything, you want to do master slave to have a warm backup.

858
00:46:55,819 --> 00:46:56,020
Scott: Right.

859
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,420
Scott: That's right.

860
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,380
Scott: Right.

861
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,582
Scott: In Postgres, even that is difficult to do.

862
00:47:00,002 --> 00:47:00,262
Scott: Right.

863
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:01,824
Scott: Just because Postgres is difficult.

864
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:05,466
Scott: So I I want to hear from the Postgres zealots out there.

865
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:05,726
Scott: Right.

866
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:06,167
Scott: Why?

867
00:47:06,187 --> 00:47:08,088
Scott: You know, if I'm not a bank.

868
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:08,668
Scott: Right.

869
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:12,751
Scott: And I don't care about like data integrity, hardcore, like wicked hardcore.

870
00:47:12,851 --> 00:47:14,292
Scott: I need everything to be perfect.

871
00:47:14,733 --> 00:47:14,973
Scott: Right.

872
00:47:15,653 --> 00:47:17,234
Scott: Why would I use Postgres?

873
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:17,595
Scott: It's just.

874
00:47:17,675 --> 00:47:18,895
Scott: it's just like a blog.

875
00:47:19,316 --> 00:47:19,776
Scott: Who cares?

876
00:47:19,816 --> 00:47:21,457
Scott: I'll use my SQL with my ISAM.

877
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:22,138
Scott: There's no sure.

878
00:47:22,178 --> 00:47:23,158
Scott: it's not as compliant.

879
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:23,719
Scott: Who gives a shit?

880
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:25,300
Scott: It works and it's crazy fast.

881
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,541
Rym: Well, here's here's my reasons for using it.

882
00:47:28,002 --> 00:47:30,764
Rym: I basically am a bank and I do need that.

883
00:47:30,844 --> 00:47:35,787
Scott: I'm saying that you are a bank, but I'm talking about people are saying like even for websites, like, oh, you got to use Postgres.

884
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:37,068
Scott: It's like, what the fuck?

885
00:47:37,108 --> 00:47:38,509
Scott: It's a fucking website.

886
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:39,069
Scott: The only other.

887
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:43,052
Scott: why would I use something that's harder to use, difficult to replicate and whatever.

888
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:45,453
Scott: There's some under the hood differences.

889
00:47:45,513 --> 00:47:48,275
Scott: Tell me what they are and why they matter to someone who is not a bank.

890
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:53,839
Rym: One thing I have found is that there are performance advantages to Postgres depending on what kind of reading it might.

891
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:55,320
Scott: it might be that Postgres.

892
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,062
Scott: You know, it being all compliant and super perfect.

893
00:47:59,143 --> 00:47:59,343
Scott: Right.

894
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:03,686
Scott: On the database, low level is faster than the MySQL in the perfect mode.

895
00:48:03,726 --> 00:48:04,186
Rym: But you know what?

896
00:48:04,226 --> 00:48:08,209
Rym: If you're if you're at the point where performance matters that much, you should be doing your own benchmarking.

897
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:08,609
Scott: Yeah.

898
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:10,450
Scott: So anyway, the second thing.

899
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:16,514
Scott: So people these same people, right, will come to you and say, yeah, we couldn't scale any of those relational databases.

900
00:48:16,554 --> 00:48:18,195
Scott: So we use the no SQL database.

901
00:48:18,255 --> 00:48:19,236
Scott: So it's like, oh, wait a minute.

902
00:48:20,016 --> 00:48:21,317
Scott: The no SQL day.

903
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,038
Scott: It's like we couldn't.

904
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:25,320
Scott: they couldn't use my SQL in the my ISAM mode because if you don't use it, you're not going to be able to use it.

905
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,101
Scott: It wasn't compliant and awesome, right?

906
00:48:27,121 --> 00:48:27,321
Scott: Yeah.

907
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:32,985
Scott: So they used either my SQL, you know, DB or Postgres, but they couldn't use those because they were too slow.

908
00:48:33,465 --> 00:48:41,211
Scott: But they could use like Mongo DB or CouchDB or Cassandra or any of these no SQL databases.

909
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:43,032
Scott: Like, ah, now we can scale and replicate.

910
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:43,652
Scott: And it's awesome.

911
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:48,275
Scott: I'm like, dude, that no SQL database that you're using is no more compliant.

912
00:48:48,315 --> 00:48:53,039
Scott: In fact, it's much less compliant than the my SQL in the fast, crappy mode.

913
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:55,120
Scott: Why didn't you just go back to using my SQL?

914
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:04,486
Rym: I think my belief is that a lot of the people who are for this are not actually super good coders.

915
00:49:05,086 --> 00:49:11,711
Rym: And basically, I've noticed like an IT, at least a lot of people shy away from learning about databases on the low level.

916
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:16,534
Rym: Like a lot of IT people, NCS people don't know much about, like, really using databases.

917
00:49:17,295 --> 00:49:25,100
Rym: So real relational databases probably scare them, and they find it a lot easier to develop for and optimize for things that aren't actually doing well.

918
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:39,709
Scott: Here's the thing is that these no SQL databases, though, what I found through extensive research, including I went to the Mongo NYC like conference last Friday, and I learned all about Mongo and about this stuff in general, right, is there are two use cases for it.

919
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:44,112
Scott: One use case is if you actually need to scale big, right?

920
00:49:44,152 --> 00:49:48,856
Scott: For example, I heard a talk from the guy who does the tech for Sluggy freelance, right, the webcomic.

921
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:52,118
Scott: And he basically just does it because he's friends with the guy, the webcomic artist.

922
00:49:52,138 --> 00:49:53,259
Scott: And, you know, he's not getting paid for anything.

923
00:49:53,279 --> 00:49:55,140
Scott: He's just doing it because, you know, he's, you know, he's not getting paid for anything.

924
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:55,801
Scott: He's a pal.

925
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:59,303
Scott: And basically, their servers couldn't handle it.

926
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:01,485
Scott: And their goal is to save money, right?

927
00:50:01,505 --> 00:50:04,247
Scott: Because basically, tech is just a cost for them, right?

928
00:50:04,287 --> 00:50:05,668
Scott: And the Sluggy guy's living off of it.

929
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:12,754
Scott: So they just want to be able to get the website to handle all the traffic, and it gets a lot of traffic comparatively to other webcomics, right?

930
00:50:13,254 --> 00:50:18,979
Scott: But they need to like as few servers as possible as with as little hardware resources possible to keep the price down.

931
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:20,240
Scott: They want to use free stuff, right?

932
00:50:20,941 --> 00:50:26,746
Scott: And in that case, right, using, you know, the NoSQL database definitely helps them out.

933
00:50:26,786 --> 00:50:40,458
Scott: It lets them, you know, scale way bigger, right, with replication, with very easy replication, easy partitioning, easy load balancing, right, easy backups and all this stuff for way cheaper than even using MySQL in the fast mode.

934
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:42,180
Scott: So that is totally good reason to use it.

935
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:51,326
Scott: Second good reason, Bitly also, there was a guy from Bitly talking about how they use it for like one function of Bitly, not the whole thing, you know, just one function of it.

936
00:50:51,386 --> 00:50:56,570
Scott: They apparently the actual Bitly part, the URL shortener is still MySQL, I think he said.

937
00:50:57,311 --> 00:50:59,932
Scott: But there's like one part of Bitly that uses Mongo.

938
00:51:00,032 --> 00:51:05,977
Scott: And they've got it like, you know, split between two machines that both have like slave backup things.

939
00:51:06,077 --> 00:51:09,079
Scott: It's like they needed to be all reliable like that and also fast.

940
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:10,700
Scott: And it totally works for that.

941
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,743
Scott: Another reason to use it is you have lots of writing going on, right?

942
00:51:15,043 --> 00:51:17,905
Scott: Because the fast mode in MySQL is really good for reading.

943
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:22,748
Scott: But if you're writing a lot to the database, it basically locks the table while it's writing.

944
00:51:22,808 --> 00:51:26,972
Scott: So if a whole bunch of people are trying to read it, while you're writing to it, it goes ahh.

945
00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:30,294
Scott: And you could use a slave and make everyone read from the slave.

946
00:51:30,374 --> 00:51:38,500
Scott: But then there's some problems occasionally where you'll write to the slave and then read immediately, write to the master, read from the slave before the write is propagated, then it's wrong.

947
00:51:38,902 --> 00:51:43,440
Scott: And if you care about that, then, you know, but that can happen in the NoSQL databases also.

948
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,120
Rym: It won't happen with Postgres, but then you need to know what you're doing to get at the replication.

949
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:50,424
Scott: You get a lot of writing going on, right?

950
00:51:50,925 --> 00:51:56,532
Scott: For example, let's say you want to put your like your tracking, your like Google Analytics, right?

951
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,896
Scott: So every time someone hits your page, you're writing to the database, right?

952
00:51:59,977 --> 00:52:02,560
Scott: That would be a good reason to use a NoSQL, right?

953
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:09,108
Rym: I guess one other case I've found, at least for me, is rapid prototyping of things.

954
00:52:09,188 --> 00:52:12,213
Rym: I'll use Couch TV just as a quick backend to stuff stuff in.

955
00:52:12,514 --> 00:52:16,080
Rym: Then I replace it with a proper database like interface once I'm done.

956
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:22,580
Rym: With like just getting my, you know, like the basic, basically the logical side of my code before I get to the actual like recoding it properly side.

957
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:27,030
Scott: Now, another reason to use a NoSQL database is because they don't have a schema, right?

958
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:31,680
Scott: So if you're using MySQL, even in the fast mode, you have to choose what columns are in your table.

959
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:39,760
Scott: And if you want to change something about your application that requires a database change, like, oh, I have to add a new field, then you've got to go to the database and add a new field.

960
00:52:40,061 --> 00:52:41,404
Scott: That's a huge pain in the ass.

961
00:52:41,744 --> 00:52:43,709
Scott: If you want to remove a field, God help you, right?

962
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,736
Scott: Most of these NoSQL guys are schema-less.

963
00:52:46,756 --> 00:52:48,740
Scott: You can just add and remove fields willy-nilly.

964
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:57,972
Scott: Two separate like, you know, rows in quotes, right, are in the same exact, you know, table in quotes also.

965
00:52:58,012 --> 00:53:03,760
Scott: Because, you know, sometimes it's like two different documents in the same collection or whatever they want to call it, right?

966
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,183
Scott: Could have completely different fields.

967
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:06,726
Scott: One could have like a name and a date field.

968
00:53:06,746 --> 00:53:13,380
Scott: Another one could have like a time and a video field, you know, and they'll be right next to each other and it won't give a shit at all.

969
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,562
Scott: And this is really useful.

970
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:17,889
Scott: Like, let's say you're making something like IMDB, right?

971
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:23,000
Scott: So you put all these movies in and, you know, OK, most movies have like a year and a director, right?

972
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,206
Scott: But, oh, my God, this movie has like a sub director and no other movie had that.

973
00:53:26,807 --> 00:53:31,677
Scott: If you're using a NoSQL database, you just be like, boom, sub director field on this one and not on any of the others.

974
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:32,920
Scott: Just do it, right?

975
00:53:33,341 --> 00:53:40,198
Scott: But if you're using a MySQL database or a relational database, you have to go and explicitly add the field just because one fluke movie came along.

976
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:41,180
Scott: And that's a pain.

977
00:53:42,321 --> 00:53:48,351
Scott: The sluggy guy actually talked about how for their e-commerce part, PayPal keeps changing like what fields they send you.

978
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:54,100
Scott: So basically he just stores every field PayPal sends them in the non-relational database, no matter what they send.

979
00:53:54,521 --> 00:53:57,028
Scott: And it doesn't matter if PayPal changes what fields it's sending.

980
00:53:57,308 --> 00:54:01,320
Scott: They just keep all of them and they only pay attention to the ones that they care about and it's all good.

981
00:54:02,361 --> 00:54:08,693
Scott: And, you know, it totally just works out because whatever PayPal sends them, they can just store every single thing that PayPal sent them, no matter.

982
00:54:08,733 --> 00:54:12,440
Scott: They don't have to keep changing their database to match PayPal's changing API.

983
00:54:12,861 --> 00:54:13,767
Scott: Just always good.

984
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:15,779
Scott: And that's another good reason for them.

985
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:21,850
Rym: I would argue, too, now that I think about it, I think another thing that drives a lot of, I guess, less apt coders to this.

986
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:27,580
Rym: I found that a lot of serious tech people I know don't actually know SQL.

987
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:31,455
Scott: I know that's like I'm really, really good at SQL.

988
00:54:31,756 --> 00:54:32,599
Scott: At least I think so.

989
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:34,247
Rym: So I'm no guru.

990
00:54:34,569 --> 00:54:36,480
Rym: I've seen some queries that make me quake.

991
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:42,579
Scott: A lot of times, you know, people try to use these ORMs, which is where you can interact with the database by objects that having to write any SQL.

992
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:47,475
Scott: And the thing is, they always frustrate me because sure, there might be easy to code and I use them.

993
00:54:47,495 --> 00:54:48,519
Scott: That's basically my job.

994
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:48,800
Scott: Right.

995
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:58,079
Scott: But it always frustrates me that they write such shitty SQL or they force me to create such shitty SQL when I know that I could write basically, you know, some page will do like 20 queries.

996
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,327
Scott: I know I could write one query to do the whole page.

997
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:03,960
Scott: I know I could do it, but I just, you know, there's an ORM sitting there.

998
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,479
Scott: And of course, you can always write raw SQL, but it's like, well, it's just more work.

999
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:07,901
Rym: Yeah.

1000
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:15,060
Rym: I mean, whenever I write stuff, you know, interfaces or things internally, like I got to grab stuff from a database and then send it via SOAP to some other thing.

1001
00:55:15,642 --> 00:55:21,880
Rym: I'll usually write, like I'll spend most of my time writing the query to get exactly what I want out of the database in the most efficient way possible.

1002
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,091
Rym: And then that will be my point of interface.

1003
00:55:24,111 --> 00:55:25,540
Rym: So my actual code is very simple.

1004
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:33,280
Rym: I'm not doing like a million transformations and like secondary lookups to figure out what, you know, this field say is defined in some other table.

1005
00:55:33,641 --> 00:55:37,574
Rym: So I'm not like doing multiple lookups or anything, just one awesome joined query.

1006
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:39,160
Rym: That's the most efficient thing possible.

1007
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:40,586
Rym: It gives me exactly what I need.

1008
00:55:40,968 --> 00:55:43,780
Rym: But a lot of coders, I just don't think can do that.

1009
00:55:44,064 --> 00:55:44,267
Scott: Nope.

1010
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:45,080
Scott: I don't think they can.

1011
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:55,120
Rym: And I think part of it is that I don't think most IT and CS education emphasizes, I think data access and data storage and SQL are actually very important subjects that are overlooked by a lot of programs.

1012
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:55,341
Scott: Yeah.

1013
00:55:55,361 --> 00:55:57,259
Scott: I took one database class and it was kind of weak.

1014
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:58,360
Scott: RIT forced us.

1015
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,092
Scott: I didn't actually learn databases in that class.

1016
00:56:00,132 --> 00:56:01,160
Scott: I learned them later on my own.

1017
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:06,040
Rym: See, RIT forced all IT majors at least to take one pretty hardcore intro to database class.

1018
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:09,748
Rym: Like it got like in the beginning it was like, this is a database.

1019
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:14,340
Rym: And by the end it was, you know, right complex outer joins from multiple heterogeneous databases.

1020
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,603
Scott: So this is another thing.

1021
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:15,923
Scott: Right.

1022
00:56:16,024 --> 00:56:21,259
Scott: So if you saw a lot of Web applications out there aren't actually relational in nature.

1023
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:21,580
Scott: Right.

1024
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,925
Scott: So think about, say, WordPress.

1025
00:56:23,186 --> 00:56:23,448
Scott: Right.

1026
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:26,320
Scott: You make a post and a post has a whole bunch of stuff in it.

1027
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,142
Scott: It's got comments.

1028
00:56:27,363 --> 00:56:28,566
Scott: It's got body text.

1029
00:56:28,627 --> 00:56:29,609
Scott: It maybe has some videos.

1030
00:56:30,111 --> 00:56:30,352
Scott: Right.

1031
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:33,260
Scott: But it's not related to anything.

1032
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:33,982
Scott: Really.

1033
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:36,289
Scott: You know, there's no reason you have to make that relational.

1034
00:56:36,589 --> 00:56:36,790
Scott: Right.

1035
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:40,300
Scott: You could totally make that non-relational where each post is its own row.

1036
00:56:40,441 --> 00:56:43,000
Scott: And every single piece of data about that post is in that row.

1037
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,123
Rym: Like think of CouchDB.

1038
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:50,972
Rym: You've got, you know, your identifier for, if you use that as an example, identifier for my blog post, you know, X. And then say I have a video associated with it.

1039
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:51,193
Rym: All right.

1040
00:56:51,213 --> 00:56:52,240
Rym: That's just in the database now.

1041
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,959
Rym: You know, video and then the file or video and then the link.

1042
00:56:56,281 --> 00:56:56,501
Scott: Right.

1043
00:56:56,521 --> 00:57:08,480
Scott: So if you don't have a relational application using one of these, you know, it does you do lose some things in terms of data integrity and data safety and, you know, making sure your data is like always correct.

1044
00:57:09,261 --> 00:57:11,849
Scott: But you make up for it because it's so scalable.

1045
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:12,231
Scott: Right.

1046
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:14,980
Scott: If you need to scale, if you don't need to scale, I say don't bother.

1047
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:15,441
Scott: Right.

1048
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:21,240
Scott: But but, you know, it is also more flexible because, you know, the fact that you can just change the schema at any time is not restricted.

1049
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,828
Rym: That's why I say it's especially good for rapid prototyping.

1050
00:57:23,848 --> 00:57:26,115
Rym: Like say like I'm I was writing I gave up on this.

1051
00:57:26,155 --> 00:57:27,660
Rym: I'm going to use something else instead.

1052
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:31,560
Rym: Say I needed to make an application is going to track like panels for a convention.

1053
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:32,520
Rym: So.

1054
00:57:33,002 --> 00:57:33,302
Rym: All right.

1055
00:57:33,322 --> 00:57:39,720
Rym: So I define define my database schema and figure out like all the data I need to track and make the database and then start writing the code.

1056
00:57:40,181 --> 00:57:44,039
Rym: Every time I decide like, all right, this logical flow is bad, I have to change it.

1057
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:46,379
Rym: I either have to change all my database schema.

1058
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,820
Scott: Alter table blah.

1059
00:57:48,221 --> 00:57:53,400
Rym: Or I have to work my code around the scheme I already wrote, as opposed to just solving the problem.

1060
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,240
Rym: So like CouchDB is perfect to just have a back end that's functional while I'm figuring out the logic.

1061
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:08,020
Rym: Because, you know, a good coder, you might get 90 percent through a project and then realize you made a fundamental flaw in your flow and you're better off kind of going all the way back and writing again.

1062
00:58:08,682 --> 00:58:12,740
Rym: Then you are writing around this problem with all this existing infrastructure.

1063
00:58:13,142 --> 00:58:17,160
Scott: The thing is, there are some applications out there that are inherently relational.

1064
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:17,861
Scott: Right.

1065
00:58:18,021 --> 00:58:21,539
Scott: You know, maybe you've got something where, you know, like.

1066
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:28,840
Rym: I don't know, you know, address books are a good example, keeping track of people, keeping track of inventory.

1067
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:36,920
Rym: Yeah, these are things where you have a list of assets and every asset has a series of defined relationships to like who owns it and all that sort of stuff.

1068
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,146
Scott: Yeah, it's like, OK, you know, who owned it?

1069
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:39,808
Scott: This person.

1070
00:58:39,888 --> 00:58:43,980
Scott: What else does this person own when you want to start asking crossways questions?

1071
00:58:44,141 --> 00:58:44,402
Scott: Right.

1072
00:58:44,422 --> 00:58:46,049
Scott: Like, OK, what are the?

1073
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,777
Scott: what are the tags in this blog post?

1074
00:58:47,797 --> 00:58:48,360
Scott: That's an upset.

1075
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,504
Scott: That's a straight up question.

1076
00:58:49,545 --> 00:58:52,740
Scott: You can just look at the blog post object and see what tags are on there.

1077
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,021
Scott: Right.

1078
00:58:53,343 --> 00:58:56,600
Scott: But a sideways question to show me all the blog posts with the tags of food.

1079
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:59,540
Rym: Suddenly you're in a lot of trouble with these non-relational database.

1080
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,659
Scott: Right now, you could do that very easily with a query or a join in SQL.

1081
00:59:04,581 --> 00:59:09,080
Scott: But using the non-relational database, you basically you have to do it yourself.

1082
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,866
Scott: You have to write your own join.

1083
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,472
Scott: What a pain in the ass is that?

1084
00:59:12,492 --> 00:59:14,580
Scott: And it's not really that fast.

1085
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:18,100
Scott: You know, I mean, sure, you're still getting the scaling and load balancing and all those good things.

1086
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:23,740
Scott: And maybe if you don't have to do it too often or you do in controlled cases with indexes and stuff like that, you'll be all right.

1087
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,510
Scott: You know, but you have to do that a lot like.

1088
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,320
Scott: that's what your application is constantly doing, that sort of thing.

1089
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,688
Scott: Like show me all the movies directed by food.

1090
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:33,996
Scott: OK, now for that movie directed by food.

1091
00:59:34,036 --> 00:59:35,100
Scott: Show me everyone who is in it.

1092
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,501
Scott: OK.

1093
00:59:35,521 --> 00:59:35,923
Scott: All right.

1094
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:45,520
Scott: You keep going cross ways and ups through the data in multiple different directions, joining and selecting across and also different or never mind data mining.

1095
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:52,240
Rym: Like if you want to be able to use this data for some sort of complex analysis later on, you really want relational databases.

1096
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,763
Scott: Yeah, if it's relational data.

1097
00:59:54,224 --> 01:00:01,820
Scott: So these people, like some of them are even suggesting, right, to use the NoSQL database when the data is highly relational.

1098
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:17,700
Scott: And, you know, maybe I can understand these people, you know, they keep making websites that are, you know, so big they need to scale so big that they, you know, it's easier for them to just write a join themselves than it is to try to get MySQL or Postgres to scale in some way, which is somewhat understandable.

1099
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:20,508
Scott: But really, that's not the right way.

1100
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:24,640
Scott: You could just, you know, put the memcache out in front and, you know, get it going properly.

1101
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,448
Scott: You know, think about, you know, even the Bitly people, right?

1102
01:00:27,548 --> 01:00:41,760
Scott: They talked about how they were using the MongoDB for this one like history feature, but they're using MySQL for the straight up, you know, URL shortener, which is far more trafficked and they've obviously made it scale and it works.

1103
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,365
Scott: Bitly ain't slow, you know?

1104
01:00:44,385 --> 01:00:47,711
Scott: So you don't need, you can scale without using these things.

1105
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:52,480
Scott: You know, scaling alone is not a reason to pick NoSQL, non-relational, over-relational.

1106
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,989
Rym: So here's the trouble, I guess, for a lot of our non-technical listeners or the not super technical.

1107
01:00:58,011 --> 01:01:06,620
Rym: It seems like the only way to know if you need a relational database or not, or if you need scaling or any of this stuff, is to already be an IT or CS expert.

1108
01:01:07,001 --> 01:01:07,162
Scott: Yeah.

1109
01:01:07,182 --> 01:01:09,488
Scott: But the thing is, even a lot of experts, like they've totally drunk.

1110
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:13,480
Scott: There were so many people there who drank the Kool-Aid on this, you know, like a lot of the people.

1111
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,639
Rym: I can say that no one in the enterprise world has.

1112
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:19,329
Scott: Granted, you know, it was the Mongo NYC.

1113
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:21,314
Scott: It was about this one product, right?

1114
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:23,440
Scott: And it was the company that, you know, supports it was there.

1115
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,100
Scott: There was obviously, you know, you pay us to learn about our thing and we try to sell it to you situation.

1116
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,267
Scott: And the thing is, a lot of the talks were straight up educational.

1117
01:01:31,348 --> 01:01:36,200
Scott: A lot of them were like really high quality people, you know, giving you the pros and cons of different setups.

1118
01:01:36,641 --> 01:01:39,189
Scott: You know, suggesting some best practices and all this stuff.

1119
01:01:40,132 --> 01:01:42,800
Scott: But there were like a couple people who were just totally Kool-Aid.

1120
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,704
Scott: And I was just like, dude, not cool.

1121
01:01:46,064 --> 01:01:46,425
Scott: Not cool.

1122
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:48,668
Scott: Like, whatever.

1123
01:01:49,550 --> 01:02:03,600
Scott: But yeah, you know, if you're out there and you want to, you know, learn some databasing or whatever, you know, it's worth playing around with these things because, you know, you can just sort of start them up and start poking at them and learn about some databasing.

1124
01:02:04,101 --> 01:02:05,606
Rym: Yeah, it's actually pretty straightforward.

1125
01:02:05,646 --> 01:02:10,359
Rym: In fact, if you really want, I would recommend if you're in like a corporate environment, you have access to it.

1126
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:22,614
Rym: The IDE, the MS SQL like server management tool, if you have an MS SQL database installed somewhere at work is actually super awesome.

1127
01:02:22,654 --> 01:02:27,100
Rym: for, you know, if you have a tail, like you import a database for writing queries and seeing how they work.

1128
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,227
Rym: And it kind of guides you in writing the SQL.

1129
01:02:29,769 --> 01:02:32,780
Rym: That's actually I've seen a lot of people learn how to do SQL with that.

1130
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:39,400
Rym: So if you're in college, you can probably get a hold of that and just, you know, use the query analyzer, write some queries, find like some test database, just mess with it.

1131
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:47,920
Scott: The other thing is that, you know, like if you connect to Postgres or MySQL on the terminal, I mean, MySQL is a lot easier to use on the shell than Postgres is.

1132
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:48,664
Rym: Postgres is really easy.

1133
01:02:48,684 --> 01:02:51,780
Rym: You just type, you know, Postgres basically.

1134
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,406
Scott: No, but the shell itself is kind of shitty.

1135
01:02:55,547 --> 01:03:01,880
Scott: It's got all these backslash commands, whereas in MySQL, you just be like, show databases, use this database, show tables.

1136
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,786
Rym: See, I guess I'm used to that.

1137
01:03:02,826 --> 01:03:03,934
Rym: Never mind fucking Oracle.

1138
01:03:03,954 --> 01:03:04,799
Rym: I got to look at like the...

1139
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,260
Scott: Yeah, I don't even know what the Oracle is like.

1140
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,940
Rym: I've learned it again.

1141
01:03:08,261 --> 01:03:08,621
Scott: Okay.

1142
01:03:09,143 --> 01:03:16,960
Scott: But, right, if you use one, a lot of these know SQL guys, their shells are even easier to use, like Mongo, for example, right?

1143
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,591
Scott: The one that I went to the conference about, their shell is basically a JavaScript.

1144
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:23,460
Scott: You can just, any JavaScript, you can type in there, right?

1145
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,086
Scott: And it's just, the whole thing is JavaScript.

1146
01:03:25,467 --> 01:03:27,695
Scott: So it's totally, it's like, you know, the Python shell.

1147
01:03:27,755 --> 01:03:29,020
Scott: It's like totally fun and awesome.

1148
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,725
Scott: You can do all sorts of crazy stuff in it.

1149
01:03:31,126 --> 01:03:35,240
Scott: And it's great for learning how their stuff works if you just open up their shell and go nuts.

1150
01:03:35,501 --> 01:03:42,780
Rym: Of course, SQL too, a lot of people are afraid of SQL, but it really is very close to natural language until you get to more advanced queries.

1151
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:49,960
Rym: I mean, anyone can understand the statement, select all from, you know, foo table where bar equals one.

1152
01:03:50,261 --> 01:03:59,340
Scott: Select name from, you know, shows dot people where name, you know, where age equals 30.

1153
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:06,800
Scott: Well, that's going to give me all the names of all the 30-year-old people in the shows table, shows database, whatever.

1154
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:12,480
Rym: I mean, it remains intelligible as a natural language further along than you'd expect.

1155
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,719
Rym: Of course, once you have like 10 case statements thrown in, you're not going to really read so well.

1156
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:16,780
Scott: I never use case statements.

1157
01:04:17,142 --> 01:04:20,316
Rym: I use case a lot when I, well, I won't get into the details.

1158
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:21,240
Rym: We've gone on too long enough.

1159
01:04:21,502 --> 01:04:21,615
Scott: Yep.

1160
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:30,090
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1161
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:35,210
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1162
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:40,610
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1163
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,550
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1164
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:48,310
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1165
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:51,806
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1166
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:56,070
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1167
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,230
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
