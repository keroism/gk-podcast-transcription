1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,945
Rym: It's Thursday April 22nd 2021.

2
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:10,346
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,352
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:17,058
Rym: tonight We are talking about pets.

5
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:19,398
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:31,671
Rym: so, uh the Rangers according to I typed Rangers odds of playoffs into Google really low because After the gate the game maybe one four in a row.

7
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:40,740
Scott: the Bruins also won four in a row suiting catch up to them Lose some games that were the elders fell back But then they just beat the shit out of us to create a bigger gap.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,417
Scott: So now not only and the Bruins won again, so it's like not only the gap got bigger Yeah, and we haven't caught up to anybody.

9
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:47,840
Scott: even worse.

10
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:55,294
Rym: I looked at the schedule because some teams got better or worse at different parts of the season But the Bruins actually have a pretty easy schedule for the rest of the year.

11
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:57,884
Rym: the way things are going right now Games remain.

12
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:00,534
Scott: it's the grab is the most important thing.

13
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,120
Scott: the games remaining against Buffalo.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,726
Scott: Yeah, the grab is the stat.

15
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:07,038
Rym: then of course we uh, we notably lost a buffalo earlier.

16
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:08,883
Scott: So One time.

17
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:09,546
Scott: Yeah, that was yeah.

18
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:15,331
Rym: Yeah, so if that doesn't happen again, cuz that could be a problem Oh, it was OT loss wasn't OT law.

19
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:20,820
Rym: So we got that point but I did Check because the odds were a lot higher before the game.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,996
Rym: We just lost and then they dropped on the on the tee.

21
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:28,533
Rym: on the TV They said they have a seven point five percent chance of winning based on some bookie.

22
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:30,660
Rym: So making it into the playoffs.

23
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:41,968
Rym: So according to Google as of right now Based on games that happened in the intervening period from the last time we checked that their odds have risen to a sparkling 8.1 percent chance.

24
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:49,715
Rym: Yeah, so either roll a natural 20 or roll a 19 and then get lucky like that's.

25
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,740
Rym: that's the odds of the Rangers making the playoffs.

26
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:53,747
Scott: Not good odds not great.

27
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,429
Rym: Ah, that's fine.

28
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:55,272
Scott: That's fine.

29
00:01:55,312 --> 00:01:57,400
Scott: Well, just you know, we weren't expected to make the play.

30
00:01:58,142 --> 00:02:00,310
Rym: There won't be hockey and it'll be warmer and then we'll continue.

31
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,120
Rym: we'll finish reading the tale of Genji instead of watching hockey.

32
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:04,183
Scott: Sure.

33
00:02:04,364 --> 00:02:11,910
Rym: I I did turn off that game the other night And I was just like fart noise.

34
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,633
Rym: nice, you know what I did.

35
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:14,620
Rym: instead I played kid Icarus on the NES.

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,325
Rym: Okay, I'm fighting.

37
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,673
Rym: actually I made it pretty far.

38
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:22,364
Rym: I'm way better at that game than I was as a kid I can only get.

39
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:29,339
Scott: I've only ever like playing honestly without passwords or anything, you know I've only ever gotten past like the first vertical level.

40
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:34,540
Rym: I've gotten to the to the end of the first dungeon and beaten it legit on a real NES as a kid.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,205
Rym: But I really couldn't get beyond that without codes.

42
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:42,787
Rym: I am using save states now, but I'm not doing any other cheating Like I'm just figuring the game out Dave states.

43
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:49,506
Scott: Oh, you're already just I'm doing the biggest possible cheating, but no other - yeah It means it's the best.

44
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:53,120
Rym: most perfect realization of me is what is me is playing this game.

45
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:58,798
Scott: Yeah, I've got a. I've got a motor in my bicycle that's hidden but no other cheating.

46
00:02:58,818 --> 00:02:59,781
Scott: that's the only cheating I'm doing.

47
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:04,620
Rym: thing is what I will say playing kid Icarus without that is an exercise in misery.

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,243
Rym: Fuck that game.

49
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:12,193
Rym: playing it just with save states is actually Way better and more fun than I expected.

50
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:17,460
Rym: because I hated that game so much I never tried this before on an emulator to actually like try to beat kid Icarus.

51
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:40,603
Rym: So anyway in some news and this is actually moderately big news that I wish the u.s would emulate France This month has voted to ban any flights Where there is a train that could do the same route that is active and available to the public it within a certain amount of time Just straight up.

52
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:46,559
Rym: So right now currently it's going to ban five routes, which might not sound like a lot.

53
00:03:46,619 --> 00:04:03,719
Rym: but to analogize this for you us ians Despite the fact that there's like a two ish hour Amtrak to Boston or DC from New York City like it's a real short Amtrak a Terrifying number of flights go between New York City Boston and DC on a daily basis.

54
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:12,203
Scott: I mean, it's like that, you know, the train is a little bit slower than the plane, but no TSA Don't.

55
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,539
Rym: yeah, there's no takes to get to the airport.

56
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:27,595
Scott: Right, exactly the you know, the train has some advantages and it's sort of evens out for those For those trips a little bit But also that they evens out for those trips in America where Amtrak sucks in France.

57
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:28,940
Rym: The trains are pretty good.

58
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:34,961
Scott: Yeah If that if that was a bullet train that went from New York to Boston the the plane would make no sense What?

59
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,233
Scott: so the worst part is it would carry less people in less time.

60
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,000
Rym: It actually kind of is a bullet train.

61
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:41,360
Rym: What one thing people always forget?

62
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,753
Rym: I think we've talked about psychicness before the Acela.

63
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:52,070
Rym: like the fast train Everyone makes fun of in America the Amtrak because it's so slow That train is actually a bullet train and can go very very fast.

64
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,280
Scott: However, technically it's like yeah sure what you know some semantic meaning.

65
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Rym: Well, the word bullet does go that fast for short segments.

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,900
Rym: The sole reason though that route in America is so slow is because they have to redo all the tracks that have really tight turns.

67
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,941
Rym: Right, they can't compare.

68
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:09,323
Rym: it does.

69
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:27,800
Scott: when I when I say bullet train I mean the real bullet trains not in the Semantic, you know, no true Scotsman sense but in the sense that on the other side of the world there are trains that go 400 500 kilometers an hour and the Accela isn't even close.

70
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:31,914
Scott: Right, if you put the Accela next to that in a race, it would look like a snail.

71
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:33,740
Rym: They also serve different purposes.

72
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,750
Rym: Those super fast trains actually cover much longer distances and The Shinkansen in Japan.

73
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,420
Scott: It depends what those aren't the fastest.

74
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:44,806
Scott: They're not.

75
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:54,337
Scott: they are not the fastest but they are still several times faster than the Accela and Japan as a country is about the size of California.

76
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:55,542
Scott: ish Yeah, right.

77
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:56,847
Scott: so you could think of the.

78
00:05:56,947 --> 00:06:03,519
Scott: it is making a trip from like, you know, LA to San Diego Which isn't too different from I'd say a Boston New York trip, right?

79
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:10,040
Rym: The point is simply this those trains that trip would be shockingly short even with our existing technology.

80
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:19,260
Rym: The sole barrier to that is the tracks themselves That NIMBYs won't allow anyone to upgrade and no government entity is willing to fund.

81
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:27,100
Rym: But even now with the current shitty Accela, I still think the US should ban flights between New York and Boston.

82
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:28,270
Scott: Oh, yeah, I'm 100% agreement.

83
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:29,681
Scott: So

84
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:55,980
Rym: in Paris, like this is a big step of Paris to a Bordeaux to Lyon to Nantes to Rennes and to Marseille are just banned and It seems like the evidence is this will have a world impacting Decrease in carbon dioxide emissions like it is a sea like it's not like enough to change our trajectory But it's like a measurable noticeable amount of reduction by not having those flights.

85
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:59,680
Rym: Mmm, and actually the rule is pretty good too.

86
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,795
Rym: The rule is if there if there's a train route that is 2.5 hours or less.

87
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:06,600
Rym: That is the trigger that will ban flights.

88
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,910
Scott: So the Accela time from New York to Boston is about three hours and change.

89
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,770
Rym: Yeah, the last I read if they fix the tracks, it would be a little under two hours.

90
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:23,815
Scott: So it'd be like seven.

91
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:24,637
Scott: it takes you.

92
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:25,821
Scott: if you leave at 7 p.m.

93
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:27,485
Scott: Today you'll get there at 1048 p.m.

94
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:27,646
Scott: Right?

95
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:36,304
Scott: If the Shinkansen can go 320 kilometer running at speeds and actually runs at speeds of 320 kilometers an hour.

96
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:44,495
Scott: Yeah, and it from New York to Boston is 346 kilometers, it would probably get there in an hour and change.

97
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:52,200
Scott: Yeah, so even the Accela with fixed tracks, right is Well, the Accela with fixed tracks is almost an hour slower.

98
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:57,140
Scott: Well, actually the Accela could go in, which is not fastest train on earth.

99
00:07:57,582 --> 00:08:00,820
Scott: So if you had the fastest train on earth, you'd probably be at least an hour.

100
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,161
Rym: Pretty sure.

101
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:02,628
Rym: the fastest trains on earth are those two Chinese bullet trains.

102
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,265
Scott: So twice as fast as the best the Accela could do under ideal conditions Right.

103
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:15,500
Rym: It looks like the Accela could go on those routes something like 220 230 kilometers an hour with relatively minor improvements to the tracks that they can't even do.

104
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:26,600
Rym: Point is it's still a laughably, you know not as Until Biden didn't actually want to invest in trains at all in the last century.

105
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:33,419
Rym: Anyway, yep operating speed 240 kilometers an hour is a baseline operating speed.

106
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,558
Rym: Looks like they picked that number because that's the number that was reasonable to expect all the tracks to be upgraded to in.

107
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:44,734
Rym: the u.s Couldn't even hit that But I encourage this.

108
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:51,160
Rym: I hope the u.s Does something similar someday and I hope we do whatever we need to do to at least connect the Northeast Corridor via Amtrak.

109
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:54,238
Scott: So yeah, I mean there should there definitely should just be.

110
00:08:54,258 --> 00:09:06,367
Scott: you know The original point right is that if there are several options several options to achieve the same thing and one of them is just Measurably more damaging.

111
00:09:06,387 --> 00:09:09,638
Scott: Yeah, you should absolutely just make that decision.

112
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:15,708
Rym: for people Like it's like having a bus or a train like those two options Make sense because they're comparable.

113
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:17,916
Rym: like there's there are slightly different use cases.

114
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:18,980
Rym: one could be the budget option.

115
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,180
Rym: There's a lot of stuff going on But planes for that kind of route is just objectively more harmful and benefits almost no one.

116
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:29,720
Scott: The same thing is like plastic bag at the grocery store, right that the paper bag is just better?

117
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,563
Scott: Yep, right.

118
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,231
Scott: Don't put the moral and take the pass on the consumer.

119
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:34,294
Rym: That's the lesson.

120
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:38,671
Rym: never put the moral hazard choice on the consumer Because that's not fair.

121
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:39,620
Rym: We all live in a society.

122
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:42,419
Rym: So you got any news.

123
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:46,200
Scott: Do I have any news Katie coop?

124
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,366
Scott: No, that's not a news.

125
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:50,214
Scott: That's that's my thing of the day for next Wednesday.

126
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,199
Rym: Oh for next Wednesday.

127
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,604
Rym: Okay I got some more news that I.

128
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:54,309
Scott: it's not even what's not even Wednesday.

129
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,497
Rym: I just figured you wanted to talk about it.

130
00:09:56,577 --> 00:10:01,715
Rym: I did And then you sent me another link that was like.

131
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:06,793
Scott: and then I said I said I said I said I said, what did I say?

132
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:11,127
Scott: Wait, I'll use that on a Wednesday Thing of today for today something else.

133
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:12,551
Rym: I didn't notice that part.

134
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:14,577
Scott: Wait, I'll use that on a Wednesday.

135
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:14,919
Scott: Yeah.

136
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:15,843
Rym: All right There we go.

137
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:16,829
Rym: So I got some news.

138
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:17,795
Rym: This is actually a big deal.

139
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:24,300
Rym: So New York City, I'll summarize this because you can go read Wikipedia if you care about all the details.

140
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:47,166
Rym: there basically are two gigantic tunnels that get all the water New York City needs into the city and they are so old and So necessary that I want to say since 1917 and 1936 for those two tunnels neither one has been inspected at any point Because there's no way to

141
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:47,748
Scott: inspect it.

142
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:51,260
Scott: You got to turn the water off exact because otherwise you go into the tunnel you drown.

143
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:54,195
Scott: Yeah, so tunnel number one waters in there moving.

144
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:55,100
Scott: how fast right?

145
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:55,902
Scott: Death.

146
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:59,419
Rym: if you go in there and you might think well turn one off leave the other one on turning one.

147
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,127
Scott: Oh, no, it's not water.

148
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,329
Rym: turning one off would literally start killing New Yorkers Like there's not enough water.

149
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,315
Scott: You can't just have one.

150
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:07,059
Scott: how I get a shit.

151
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:16,923
Rym: So tell us number one and two Thankfully just seem to still be trucking but we have no idea how hot like how they're doing So.

152
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:23,649
Rym: the city has been trying for a little over 50 years To build tunnel number three.

153
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,826
Scott: This is like even mind these these tunnels right are Just to give you a perspective right?

154
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:33,440
Scott: So the water comes from upstate New York like many Harmon type places.

155
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:39,560
Scott: There are many there are many reservoirs and we have the Catskill aqueduct is like the biggest longest.

156
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:42,549
Scott: It's like the longest man-made tunnel is I don't know.

157
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:47,006
Scott: It's this humongous aqueduct right that gets the water to the city right.

158
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:52,459
Scott: that system Once it's in the city There's like this place that you know.

159
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,446
Scott: I've seen it on.

160
00:11:53,768 --> 00:12:02,762
Scott: I seen a picture one time of like Where the water comes from the aqueduct and enters the New York water system and that's where these other tunnels come into play the tunnel One and two.

161
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:05,069
Scott: Yeah, it's a tunnel one and two doesn't?

162
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:13,020
Scott: outside isn't like, you know up in New York's, you know somewhere north Right, that's actually that's the Catskill aqueduct and other things that feed in or whatever.

163
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:19,760
Rym: Yeah, the system that gets water to New York is both very complicated but also surprisingly simple in terms of how it operates.

164
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:22,894
Scott: It's just as if it's complicated and simple hard and easy.

165
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,060
Scott: Yeah and expensive.

166
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:27,012
Rym: That's how I would describe most major infrastructure like.

167
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:28,860
Rym: the principles involved are fairly simple.

168
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:37,980
Rym: Like a lot of these things are designed so that they're slightly downhill For like miles and miles and miles and miles and miles to the point that you don't need pumps water will just go.

169
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:53,360
Rym: but To design that system to actually get the water from all the places and get it to the right place in the right quantities Figuring out that exact angle and figuring out exactly how to put it all together and how to deal with exceptions That is very complicated.

170
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:57,219
Scott: Also the further away you get from the start of the tunnel the deeper you got to dig.

171
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:02,060
Rym: Like well the tunnel number three, I think it's gonna be six hundred feet underground.

172
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:03,404
Scott: That's far.

173
00:13:03,705 --> 00:13:09,360
Rym: that is very far especially because this area is a lot of like bedrock kind of ground.

174
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,243
Rym: Just it's way.

175
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,952
Scott: it's way lower than subways like not even close.

176
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,100
Scott: It's it's way down there.

177
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:21,438
Rym: So work has begun on the final phase of tunnel number three.

178
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:31,332
Rym: tunnel Number three actually is as far as I've read it started supplying water to Manhattan But it is not linked to the rest of the New York City system yet.

179
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:34,080
Rym: And the final segment is in Long Island City.

180
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:35,318
Rym: That's the last part they have to dig.

181
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:42,820
Scott: Yeah, so what's interesting about these these tunnels right is that you know, yeah, you have to be able to access them somehow.

182
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:45,147
Scott: So there's these shafts, right?

183
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:48,597
Scott: It's like a various spots along the tunnel, right?

184
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:52,127
Rym: There's a vertical Jeopardy question or jeopardy answer.

185
00:13:52,388 --> 00:14:01,116
Rym: What are places river really would like to break into if he wouldn't be around Along that's along the tunnel right at various spots.

186
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:11,895
Scott: every so often There is some vertical hole like a straight down hole that there where you could go from the surface of the earth Open it up and go downstairs elevator.

187
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:12,276
Scott: I don't know what.

188
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:15,758
Scott: they got in there And go down to where the tunnel is.

189
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:18,292
Scott: Obviously, they're all fucking locked.

190
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:21,827
Rym: because yeah In fact, the city has actually started.

191
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:22,068
Rym: they've.

192
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,422
Rym: there were a lot more photos and press access to the sites where they were building tunnel Number three.

193
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:31,940
Rym: they have actually started scrubbing all those images off the internet wherever they find them and they have control over them.

194
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,709
Rym: They've banned press access.

195
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:35,197
Rym: They've shut down archives.

196
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:48,408
Rym: They're basically There's a lot of secrecy now around the exact details of where tunnel number three is Well, I mean for security reasons and also for you know picky me out, of course Yeah, people who are going there and die.

197
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:51,140
Scott: Yeah, it's a super dangerous place to work.

198
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,540
Scott: You know the people working there's are you know, risking their lives just to dig the thing, right?

199
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,750
Scott: So they don't want anyone unnecessarily you would.

200
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,400
Scott: you would never be fat if you went in there and died.

201
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,205
Scott: You would never be found.

202
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:12,645
Rym: I bet it's probably mafia bodies in the tunnel But like these stores always fascinating because any any piece of information you learn even reading this article I'm gonna link to You'll notice something.

203
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:16,280
Rym: and if you wonder about that you could go down a rabbit hole that would consume the rest of your night.

204
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:27,602
Rym: Like for example tunnel number three first began delivering water to Manhattan in 1998. and Why those?

205
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:28,964
Rym: why the end is there?

206
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:35,310
Rym: I'm not sure but that links to another article that There's a whole bunch of nonsense going on.

207
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:46,919
Scott: The point is is that once tunnel three is done and fully operational then they're going to shut down Temporarily tunnel number one, which will be by humans in over a hundred years.

208
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:59,159
Scott: There will be enough capacity to turn the water off on the other tunnels at least enough to go in there Yeah, and hopefully not die when going in there and clean it fix it, etc.

209
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,912
Scott: Which will probably take many many years.

210
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:10,400
Rym: and then now there is a danger Because apparently we New York City partly due to climate change has started to hit already.

211
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,060
Rym: It's bumping up against the maximum throughput of tunnels one and two combined.

212
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:22,596
Rym: So we got to do the maintenance on one and two before we get to the point where we now can't turn off any of them Again, which is probably coming.

213
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:28,860
Rym: The last interesting thing is so work began on the last two shafts there.

214
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,800
Rym: It's like a 14 mile one and I think an 11 mile one.

215
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:46,040
Rym: The final end of this looks like it's going to be in Mm-hmm, and then they have to build even more tunnels to connect it to even more parts of the city that are not as important.

216
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:49,860
Rym: I think in 2026 is when they can plan shutting down to the number one temporarily.

217
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:57,892
Scott: Yeah, you know SimCity 2000 when they added the water system really under you know You could just drag pipes and just like diggity diggity instantly.

218
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:02,259
Scott: It's like they while the game is paused They really did not accurately simulate.

219
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:07,180
Rym: This feels more like you haven't played hearts of iron with us yet when we did some live games.

220
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:08,428
Rym: It's like all right.

221
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:09,519
Rym: I want to make a new ship.

222
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:14,257
Rym: I want to another destroyer in my fleet and you click a bunch of buttons and then it'll.

223
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:23,556
Rym: you'll look at the game and the Game says like yeah, it's October 4th 1937 that's next destroyer will be done in 1941 and that's as fast as it's gonna be there.

224
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:31,970
Rym: and Four hours later, you'll get a notification like hey that one ship you asked for is done in some other news.

225
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:47,839
Rym: This is interesting because we talked about this on GeekNights and you but I think we even linked to the documentary of course but as you know the the character Apu on The Simpsons is problematic for a bunch of reasons and There's been a lot of conversation around that.

226
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:48,984
Rym: We're not qualified to talk.

227
00:17:49,024 --> 00:18:02,708
Rym: wasn't there a whole documentary Fantastic documentary and one of the points in it was that Hank Azaria in the documentary like Basically seemed to disagree didn't want to engage was defensive and the documentary kind of focused on that.

228
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,482
Rym: rightly The news which just happened.

229
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,587
Rym: this looks like it's breaking.

230
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:24,670
Rym: as of like 7 a.m Today or at least very recently in the last few days Hank Azaria actually turned around and issued not a press release saying like I apologize But he was doing some interview thing and he talked about this topic and how the documentary actually forced him to see things.

231
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,553
Rym: He changed his like.

232
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:26,536
Rym: he realized he's wrong.

233
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:27,619
Rym: He up.

234
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:33,076
Rym: He like openly and it appears very earnestly apologized and I'm not gonna like.

235
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:35,690
Rym: this does not excuse anything that happened in the past.

236
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,490
Rym: That is not even a not something we could even like discuss because we're two white dudes doing a podcast.

237
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:41,233
Scott: I mean, it's not.

238
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:45,470
Scott: how can we I can't you know, accept someone's apology because I'm not the harmed person?

239
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:57,941
Rym: Yeah, right but I think this article is worth reading because it is also from the perspective of an Indian American talking about Like this apology and it links to the apology and it's.

240
00:18:58,623 --> 00:19:00,490
Rym: it's something I honestly didn't expect to happen.

241
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:13,228
Rym: I expected that that documentary like we all watched it and that Hank Azaria We're just never saying anything about this again and everyone just try to avoid being in any way tied to that controversy and instead kind of out of nowhere.

242
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:18,510
Rym: he like Apologized and there was at least a step forward in that conversation.

243
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:22,240
Scott: Yeah, if anyone doesn't know he's like he's the voice actor.

244
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,568
Scott: He voices like half the characters on the show.

245
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:26,623
Scott: Yep He's also a real actor.

246
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:27,389
Scott: He's been a lot of movies.

247
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:32,297
Rym: But yeah, I know what you mean.

248
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,857
Scott: voice actors are real actors, right but you know, they're like you people.

249
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:41,356
Scott: I think people don't realize like you'll be watching a movie like I Think he was in Heat, right?

250
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:41,718
Scott: He's never.

251
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,850
Scott: I've never think he's ever been like the main character.

252
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:53,935
Scott: He might have been in certain things I don't know about but it's like you'll see him in like he'll be in a movie and you won't realize it's like that's fucking Chief Wiggum Because he's not using that voice.

253
00:19:53,956 --> 00:20:00,209
Scott: He's using whatever voice is appropriate for the movies and you know, which is not you know, it's not like.

254
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:03,866
Scott: You know the the bender Jake guy who sounds the same.

255
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:04,409
Scott: What's his name?

256
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,709
Rym: Why do I always forget that dude's name?

257
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:09,941
Scott: If you told me the name, I'd be like.

258
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:14,584
Scott: if you said the name first I'd be like, oh that I know that is I literally forget this dude's the Joe DiMaggio.

259
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:23,789
Rym: Yeah, exactly Literally every time I just forget that dude's name, but anyway, it's not like.

260
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:29,940
Scott: you know Joe when he's voicing a character like you can tell it's him, right but His area like you can't.

261
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,128
Scott: he does different voice every time.

262
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:38,390
Rym: yep It's interesting how over time that voice became in my brain the voice of Jake and like if I ever watched a few drama.

263
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:40,918
Rym: It's just like oh that's Jake's voice and it feels weird.

264
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:43,707
Rym: instead of looking at Jake and saying oh that's bender's voice.

265
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:44,349
Rym: That feels weird.

266
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:47,515
Rym: But yeah, just I was.

267
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:51,410
Rym: I was surprised that there was a further note in this story.

268
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,910
Rym: Like I didn't think anything would ever come of this story again, at least from the white dude.

269
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:58,905
Rym: So yeah read this and form your own opinion.

270
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:02,489
Rym: I'm not gonna Really comment on that further.

271
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:04,887
Rym: So do you have any news?

272
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:08,376
Scott: There's nothing.

273
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,667
Scott: there's nothing really happening.

274
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:12,434
Rym: I Mean, there's a lot happening.

275
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:16,930
Rym: It's just stuff that we're not qualified to comment on or really don't want to center our voices on here.

276
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,535
Rym: I'll go to FARC.

277
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:19,006
Rym: It's going on a FARC right now.

278
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:19,470
Rym: Let's see.

279
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:23,456
Rym: Uh Something about the yellow pages.

280
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:25,101
Rym: all these headlines are all hard.

281
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:25,944
Scott: No, no.

282
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:27,509
Scott: No, I'm at Google News.

283
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:30,147
Scott: No No, those are our Monday newses.

284
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:31,643
Scott: No, no, no.

285
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:39,070
Rym: Tech company razor announces plastic free single-use toilet bamboo toilet paper, which raises more questions than it answers.

286
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:42,782
Rym: Yes An RV exploded somewhere.

287
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:55,439
Rym: All right, that's sad Uh, I got a bunch of phone calls today from an alarm company telling me that a temperature sensor was continuing to get hotter and Hotter at some middle school in New Jersey.

288
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:57,430
Rym: They have not called back recently.

289
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:13,128
Rym: So I'm assuming that that school did not burn down and that they've realized they were calling the wrong number all day things Of the day, so check this out.

290
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:22,367
Rym: I'm gonna link to a Twitter thread from a fantastic Twitter account in Kuna Bula which mostly talks about Historic writing historic texts.

291
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:26,700
Rym: can a form tablets that kind of thing like Dead Sea Scrolls stuff like really good history.

292
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,483
Scott: Yeah form isn't it?

293
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:28,969
Scott: CUNY form can.

294
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,479
Rym: a form is how I've heard most professors pronounce it.

295
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:32,946
Scott: I mean, I don't know the end.

296
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:33,771
Scott: I don't know the answer.

297
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:34,575
Scott: I'm just asking.

298
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:37,625
Rym: Yeah, I'm good but most professors pronounce it.

299
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:55,471
Rym: that way in my experience could also be wrong because as you all may remember if you listen to gig nights a Long time in my middle school and in my high school multiple teachers pronounce the name Goethe as goeth and I was too stupid to realize they were wrong.

300
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:59,896
Scott: I Didn't know you were so adamant about saying Heracles.

301
00:22:59,936 --> 00:23:01,765
Scott: all the time I am adamant because I.

302
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:02,990
Rym: that's something I care about.

303
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,914
Rym: I'm weirdly mad about.

304
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:05,460
Rym: I still don't know why I'm so mad about that.

305
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:20,612
Rym: Anyway, so I'll link to the Twitter thread because the thing that is the thing that day is amazing But this Twitter thread does a really good job of Framing a particular aspect of why this thing is so amazing.

306
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:21,876
Rym: if you've never heard of it.

307
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:24,540
Rym: This is the trippytaka coriana.

308
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:29,755
Rym: If I describe this without explaining like without just telling you what it is.

309
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:42,799
Rym: It's basically possibly the most complete and error-free transmission and storage of about two gigabytes of data from in the course of human history.

310
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:55,160
Rym: this is two gigabytes of data that has been maintained error-free since long before the year 1200 and The story behind how it was made and what it is is just amazing.

311
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,208
Rym: Basically it is.

312
00:23:58,268 --> 00:24:09,659
Rym: if I had to summarize it is a collection of the Buddhist scriptures carved into 481258 wooden printing blocks.

313
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:21,434
Rym: Those printing blocks are stored in a special building that was built in the 13th century with the idea it was designed to be a permanent archive of this information.

314
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:26,271
Rym: it tended to last forever and It does continue to exist.

315
00:24:26,553 --> 00:24:35,760
Rym: It's the same building It's the same wood blocks and the cool thing about it is the design was such that the wooden blocks are the authoritative source of truth.

316
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:47,260
Rym: They spent like 13 years carving these blocks with the characters not only so that they could then say this is the official Unedited version of this text where there couldn't be a disagreement about it or a way to forge one.

317
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:51,919
Rym: It's it's intricately catalogued and stored in a way to where it's persisted to this day.

318
00:24:52,702 --> 00:25:03,358
Rym: But what they would do is take those blocks out and use those blocks to print Books and the books were what people had access to the monks who ran or run this site.

319
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:06,130
Rym: to this day They just maintained the blocks themselves.

320
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:08,745
Scott: Mmm, I can't believe.

321
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:18,561
Scott: this thing is basically like a wonder of the world that like no one I've never heard of it It wasn't designated as a UNESCO heritage site until like 1995.

322
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:19,912
Scott: UNESCO is an interesting thing.

323
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:20,859
Scott: I always think about UNESCO.

324
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:24,219
Scott: It's like it feels like every country in the world except the United States.

325
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:24,963
Scott: Maybe like.

326
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,333
Scott: do we not like, you know, like sighs.

327
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,020
Scott: do we like not sign up with them or something?

328
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:35,600
Scott: And every other country in the world UNESCO like dictates like this is a cultural heritage site.

329
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,965
Scott: This is an important thing.

330
00:25:37,065 --> 00:25:38,449
Rym: I mean we do that too, but we're like.

331
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,031
Scott: are there any?

332
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:41,640
Scott: are there any UNESCO cultural heritage sites in New?

333
00:25:41,864 --> 00:25:42,060
Scott: York City?

334
00:25:44,282 --> 00:25:50,100
Rym: What was that Eddie is a bit long ago where it was like oh this mall was built in.

335
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:57,420
Scott: Yeah in the United States like, you know, we we dictate our own things.

336
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,300
Scott: We're like, ah, this is a national monument, right?

337
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,525
Scott: We don't know.

338
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:10,740
Scott: when there's no international people like saying ah This is an important thing even even things in the United States in our territory that are older than our very I don't know.

339
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:11,182
Rym: I do.

340
00:26:11,242 --> 00:26:14,497
Rym: I probably do not know how many UNESCO World Heritage sites there are in the u.s.

341
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:15,060
Scott: I don't know that.

342
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,321
Scott: I don't.

343
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:24,617
Scott: yeah, I just know that like that's I just know that UNESCO is an organization and and you know picking You know designating cultural heritage sites is one of their functions.

344
00:26:24,657 --> 00:26:25,240
Scott: That's what I know.

345
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:26,565
Rym: But think about this.

346
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:28,091
Rym: most of you probably never heard of this.

347
00:26:28,473 --> 00:26:32,285
Rym: so yeah in the year like 1000 they made this thing.

348
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:34,652
Rym: in the year like 1200 something.

349
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:42,075
Rym: it got burned down by the Mongols and then the nation State of the place at the time decided you know what we're gonna rebuild this thing.

350
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:43,079
Rym: We're gonna make it even better.

351
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:48,951
Rym: and that data is That data has made it further than a lot of data.

352
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:51,700
Rym: I have generated in the last 10 years, right?

353
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,623
Scott: So it's in Korea.

354
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:58,541
Scott: so think about all the shit that has happened in Korea including obviously Korean War yeah between 1200 something.

355
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:06,939
Scott: and today Yep, and nobody went there and messed it up even though a lot of people wanted to take it.

356
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,566
Rym: That really sets this up.

357
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:18,372
Rym: the production of the Tripitaka Coriana was an enormous national commitment of money and manpower Perhaps comparable to the u.s.

358
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:29,139
Rym: Mission to the moon in the 60s Mm-hmm and this Twitter thread really frames it like the Transmission of data over the centuries like libraries do this.

359
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:41,480
Rym: But this Twitter thread makes a good point about how that is usually serendipitous like the intention of a library Especially like in the United States is not necessarily to preserve an unedited have access.

360
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:43,406
Scott: Yeah, it's to spread access.

361
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:47,800
Rym: Yeah, but this was this was the kind of thing that you see in sci-fi.

362
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:55,460
Rym: This was an archive that is intended to stand the test of time and last forever And it's doing a pretty fucking good job of lasting forever.

363
00:27:56,946 --> 00:28:01,560
Scott: Yeah, all right well That's it's a really high quality thing of the day not as good as my thing of the day.

364
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:04,820
Rym: So the day is real good, so is it okay?

365
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:26,976
Scott: So there are these things in the United States, and I imagine no other country though I guess I could be wrong about that, but this feels like a very United States white people thing and that is Pig calling Contests which is you know you go to the country fair, and there's a microphone and you go to the microphone And you call a pig like here piggy piggy piggy.

366
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:28,983
Scott: you know come on You know what it's you.

367
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:33,919
Scott: what would you what noises would you make using you just your body and a mic and you know in?

368
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,135
Scott: order to Convince a pig to come to you and move in your general direction right.

369
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:46,260
Scott: and then I assume There's some sort of judging scoring system that I know nothing about and a winner is chosen.

370
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:47,267
Scott: Maybe they get a ribbon.

371
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:48,254
Scott: Maybe you get a prize.

372
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:49,120
Scott: Maybe some bacon.

373
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,076
Scott: I don't know what your prize is for winning the pig calling contest money.

374
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:56,273
Scott: I don't know But obviously they're really hilarious to watch.

375
00:28:56,353 --> 00:29:02,240
Scott: you know people making pig noises People jumping up and down people taking it seriously people taking it not so seriously.

376
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,363
Scott: Etc.

377
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,612
Rym: I participated.

378
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:11,560
Rym: I learned how to do Pig calling as part of a 4-h thing with my Cub Scout pack when I was a little kid.

379
00:29:12,524 --> 00:29:13,330
Scott: We did not do that.

380
00:29:13,431 --> 00:29:14,760
Rym: Okay, but I got good.

381
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:26,254
Scott: In this video somebody has taken Video footage from some pig calling contests and edit it together.

382
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:48,515
Scott: on the right side of the screen and on the left side of the screen is a person with an electric guitar and Effectively They are playing the electric guitar With quite a bit of distortion along with the edited pig calling noises to create a somewhat good heavy metal song.

383
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:55,439
Scott: because What's how far away is pig calling from heavy metal vocalists?

384
00:29:57,764 --> 00:30:07,599
Rym: Little more so reeling and a little less growling but otherwise No, I'm just saying Excellent excellent mashup here.

385
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:15,860
Rym: In the meta moment my reading of the tale of Genji did not accelerate as expected because I thought I could sit outside and read.

386
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:16,611
Rym: It got cold again.

387
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:20,793
Rym: So I think it'll accelerate soon.

388
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:21,680
Rym: give us another week or two.

389
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,058
Rym: It's weirdly extra cold for some reason now, and hopefully it will be warm again soon.

390
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:30,735
Scott: Gig night they gave us the super cold winter with all the snow and I was inside.

391
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:33,004
Scott: it had to go outside and now it's Like ah, okay.

392
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:34,951
Scott: We're almost ready to go outside still cold.

393
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:36,376
Rym: Yeah, like it was so warm.

394
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:37,500
Rym: I went for a bike ride.

395
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:38,103
Rym: I'm home.

396
00:30:38,123 --> 00:30:42,280
Scott: Like I said the upside of the climate change is that it's global warming.

397
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:48,518
Scott: It's like if you're gonna kill us all and raise the sea level at least in the meantime.

398
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:51,668
Scott: if that's somehow Unavoidable because obviously I would like to avoid that.

399
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:56,004
Scott: but if it's unavoidable at least make it 90 degrees every day While I'm done.

400
00:30:56,184 --> 00:31:00,180
Rym: Well, you're talking about how New York City is a humid subtropical climate and has been for about five.

401
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:01,479
Scott: Then why is it fucking 40 degrees?

402
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,597
Scott: Because it's spring at the end of April.

403
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:11,600
Rym: At least in the old days we wouldn't have that like couple weeks of it being weirdly warm before we had the cold snap again.

404
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,038
Rym: It would just be cold and still be cold right now.

405
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:20,100
Rym: There weren't many years where I was outside running and it was like 75 degrees and sunny on April 22nd in the fast.

406
00:31:21,165 --> 00:31:21,777
Scott: Just make it warm.

407
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:23,466
Rym: Well, let's get in there.

408
00:31:23,587 --> 00:31:24,070
Rym: Stay tuned.

409
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:25,580
Rym: I think it'll be warm this weekend.

410
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:28,229
Rym: Maybe I'll go bike up on that South County Trailway.

411
00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:29,333
Scott: It's gonna rain.

412
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:31,440
Rym: I only on Sunday last I checked.

413
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:33,326
Rym: I'm gonna check right now.

414
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,500
Rym: Let's see 10-day forecast for Queens.

415
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,311
Rym: So no Saturday 69 degrees.

416
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:39,512
Rym: No rain.

417
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:42,505
Scott: What's the low?

418
00:31:42,606 --> 00:31:46,820
Scott: you and your high one the lowest 50 is gonna be 69 degrees for like two seconds.

419
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,773
Rym: Now the low is 53 and that's mostly at night.

420
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:51,038
Rym: It's gonna be mostly warm all day.

421
00:31:51,058 --> 00:31:52,763
Rym: It looks like This one.

422
00:31:52,883 --> 00:31:55,754
Scott: I says says it's gonna be 52 at like 8 in the morning.

423
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:57,179
Rym: Yeah, I'm not gonna be up biking.

424
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:58,506
Rym: then I'll be biking at like 10.

425
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:01,200
Scott: You can't get very far if you're not up at 8 in the morning.

426
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:04,618
Rym: I got a lot more daylight now than I used to have at the end of the season last year.

427
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,084
Scott: sunset 746 yeah, that's fine.

428
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:08,767
Rym: I can bike in the dark.

429
00:32:08,787 --> 00:32:09,248
Rym: I got lights.

430
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,456
Scott: sunrise 6 a.m Good.

431
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:11,858
Scott: There you go.

432
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:12,380
Scott: You got a skit.

433
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:18,100
Rym: I only get up that early if I'm like hiking mountain climbing or skiing or something.

434
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:19,859
Rym: I'm not getting up that early for a bike ride.

435
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:31,281
Scott: It's a good strategy actually to get up that early for the bike ride because by the time you have escaped the car area The you know that there's no traffic at 6 a.m Really true Zone

436
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:40,360
Rym: because usually I go to the west side because I like that route and I go up to Cortland up to Cortland Park to Get to the trail way, but it is much faster and more direct to just go over Randall's Island into the Bronx.

437
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:41,739
Scott: That's the way I go.

438
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,959
Rym: But those routes have a lot of cars and a lot of people parked in the bike lanes.

439
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,242
Scott: They're not really.

440
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:48,129
Rym: I've run into a lot of.

441
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,779
Rym: in fact, I have a video of all the cars blocking the bike lanes.

442
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:53,146
Scott: Yeah, it's not a bad.

443
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:55,199
Rym: I get a time-lapse almost every time I do that ride.

444
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,191
Rym: Anyway, so, uh, that's the meta moment.

445
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:00,475
Rym: like can find our stuff.

446
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:04,451
Rym: We're uh We're not doing any cons anytime soon.

447
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:06,160
Rym: Like there won't be any guns anytime soon.

448
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,248
Rym: Don't go to cons that happen anytime soon.

449
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:10,980
Scott: Obviously, if you live in New Zealand, you can go to a car.

450
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:17,389
Rym: Oh, yeah, if you live in New Zealand, you can go to a car packs off maybe some other Other countries, but that's toward the end of the year.

451
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:18,573
Scott: I don't know.

452
00:33:18,653 --> 00:33:20,479
Scott: I can't say if you should go to that or not.

453
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,667
Rym: Yeah, it looks like it's scheduled at least and they're still talking about increasing the capacity.

454
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:26,869
Rym: Australia is doing better than us.

455
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:27,410
Rym: we can say that.

456
00:33:28,889 --> 00:33:30,974
Scott: Okay It's hard not to be.

457
00:33:31,055 --> 00:33:33,407
Rym: yeah All right, so we'll get right into it.

458
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,899
Rym: Oh, we didn't have a lot of Thursday shows queued up.

459
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:41,000
Rym: Uh, so we're gonna talk about pets which is something yet is very near and dear to me.

460
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:50,854
Scott: I've had a lot more pets than Scott at least but yes somehow in 15 16 years of GeekNights We haven't done a topic so basic as pets something that comes up just every day.

461
00:33:50,874 --> 00:33:52,620
Rym: just review the Simpsons.

462
00:33:54,081 --> 00:34:04,015
Scott: Sure, you know just saying I mean we did talk about Simpsons in the past at some point just not as the main bit Directly as itself, you know, it was incorporated into some other shows.

463
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:04,958
Scott: right that happens a lot.

464
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:10,034
Scott: Yeah But yeah, it's like said something so basic and fundamental to everyday life.

465
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:11,199
Scott: We have not done a show on it.

466
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:14,900
Scott: It's really hard to think of those things as they're hiding in plain sight.

467
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,752
Scott: It's like what should I do a show on?

468
00:34:16,831 --> 00:34:21,588
Scott: and you could almost imagine a Simpson scene where someone's like hmm.

469
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,871
Scott: What should I?

470
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:25,719
Scott: something something and there's a giant something something walking around?

471
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:27,998
Rym: Well, you know why?

472
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:35,760
Rym: Well, I'm through the the process now like we used to have different processes We used to plan a lot more for a Thursday episode is well both bit during kovid.

473
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,016
Rym: we'll both be in our respective computer rooms and we'll have a discord conversation of what should we do the show on.

474
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:51,060
Rym: and Usually this now involves both of us looking around the room and typing nouns That we see that we don't think we've ever talked about that class of noun before.

475
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:53,527
Rym: Usually I'm not out of the room.

476
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:55,054
Scott: It's not likely to be a show.

477
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:58,197
Rym: Yep, but Usually only to find out that.

478
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:06,202
Rym: oh, yeah We actually did a show on that in 2006 and then we did it again in 2012 and here we are in 2021.

479
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:09,700
Scott: But yeah, somehow we've never done a single pet show ever.

480
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:25,299
Rym: So at least so easy if you think of other ideas along these lines something that is so simple and it's not Especially things that are not science technology gaming Anime animation comics manga something that is not one of those things.

481
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,196
Scott: Yeah, tell us cuz we need a Thursday ideas.

482
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:42,280
Rym: Yep So what's interesting is in my life partly like my family my entire family pretty much is very Like animal centric like we just always were even my extended family for the most part like not just like my direct family.

483
00:35:42,823 --> 00:35:53,359
Rym: So I basically lived surrounded by pets ranging from standard cats and dogs to exotics to Straight up like deer and raccoons at times.

484
00:35:53,962 --> 00:36:12,594
Rym: so I've interacted with a lot of animals and it was actually a a weird not a homesickness cuz I was jazzed to be in college, but There was a very weird time in my life when I was at between RIT and the living in Beacon where I didn't have a pet and That like gap was very like prominent in my just feelings.

485
00:36:13,136 --> 00:36:24,698
Rym: and when we moved to New York City I have a pet again and I think that there that one period where I didn't have pets will hopefully be one of the only periods in my life That is of any significant length of time where there are not pets in my home.

486
00:36:25,622 --> 00:36:26,324
Scott: Yeah, I'm not the.

487
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:31,862
Scott: I mean, I'm not the exact opposite like never had a pet but I've not had Many pet right?

488
00:36:31,943 --> 00:36:32,263
Scott: It's like.

489
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:35,612
Scott: what did I you know when I was very very young like?

490
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,440
Scott: I can't even remember so young, right?

491
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:46,642
Scott: My parents had a cat that was named Sherlock, right and my memory of this cat is not the cat itself I don't.

492
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:49,940
Scott: I couldn't even pick it out of a row of cats in a lineup, right?

493
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,820
Scott: Though I guess it was orange maybe but I think there's a photo of it somewhere.

494
00:36:55,262 --> 00:37:14,291
Scott: But when I was young I remember the furniture my parents had in their bedroom Had all these like lines on it like all around the base of the furniture all the furniture Right and it wasn't until later that I realized Right that basically that cat was an evil demon cat.

495
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:17,240
Scott: My parents were afraid was gonna kill me when I was in baby form.

496
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:27,390
Scott: That scratched the shit up basically everything and you could tell how high the cat could reach because all the furniture was scratched Like this horizontal.

497
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:33,487
Scott: it looked like, you know Like you go to the beach and you see the line where low tide is high tide reaches It's low cats.

498
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:36,901
Rym: what it was like, it's low Exactly.

499
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:44,024
Scott: So I think that you know, my parents they had you know a dog or you know different pets in their lives, but We didn't get.

500
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:50,100
Scott: the only pet I had when I was a kid was I had some fish and then I didn't have fish.

501
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:59,106
Scott: and then when I left to go to college they got dusty the dog and Then that's pretty much it in the Reuben family his pets go.

502
00:37:59,166 --> 00:37:59,990
Rym: That's it was a good dog.

503
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:06,539
Rym: I enjoyed my times hanging out with dusty though as I as he got older and dusty would definitely bark at me a lot more than he used to.

504
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:09,884
Scott: Well dusty, uh, you know, I couldn't get him to bite you.

505
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:19,239
Scott: but you know, yeah I did my best he'd bonk his head against me and then run away or go chase a Paper towel, I mean when you know, we haven't dusty.

506
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:22,510
Scott: Yeah when dusty was a was like a baby dog.

507
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:26,830
Scott: He would like eat paper towel, you know, yip a hole way too much.

508
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:30,790
Scott: But then when he got older he sat on the couch and watch TV like a Reuben.

509
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,392
Rym: Yeah, we What that?

510
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:39,166
Rym: the only like common pet we never had like the really common pet was probably cats.

511
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:40,470
Rym: not because no one like cats.

512
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,235
Rym: We just ended up.

513
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:48,930
Rym: our family never had cats Not even because anyone was allergic to them or anything and I at least when I was a kid was not allergic to cats.

514
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:58,628
Rym: I am now as an adult like Frighteningly allergic to cats like to a degree that is like comical in an 80s movie.

515
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:02,049
Rym: the character Who's only beat is they are allergic to cats allergic?

516
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,973
Rym: But yeah, let's see we had So new.

517
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:19,500
Rym: so when I was born my parents already had a bunch of dogs like just three bunch of dogs in the house And I have a lot of very like kid memory of those dogs like mascot and Libby Springer spandrels, and then we rescued dogs.

518
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,945
Rym: We got Brock it.

519
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:22,550
Rym: then we adopted different dogs.

520
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,369
Rym: We just had dogs in the house for my entire life.

521
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:34,786
Rym: We had fish The first pets that we like me and my little brother would like to have to take care of and there were our pets instead Of just the family pets hamsters.

522
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:35,250
Rym: we had figgy.

523
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,395
Rym: Hamsters don't live that long.

524
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:40,285
Rym: Then we had figgy the second and we had figgy the third.

525
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:41,510
Rym: then we had a fourth one.

526
00:39:41,571 --> 00:39:42,606
Rym: We just called figgy again.

527
00:39:43,752 --> 00:39:47,614
Rym: There was I want to say we had a fifth figgy and We just as kids.

528
00:39:47,996 --> 00:39:54,010
Rym: figgy was such a good name for a hamster that we apparently Ademantly refused to ever name a hamster anything but figgy.

529
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:57,178
Scott: That was just a hamsters at once.

530
00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:59,490
Rym: just two figgies now only ever had one hamster at a time.

531
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:03,003
Rym: You know hamsters do not like to be around other hamsters for the most part.

532
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:04,650
Scott: How do they make more hamsters?

533
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,169
Rym: They're around them long enough to make more hamsters.

534
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:12,890
Rym: Okay, interesting We had gerbils at one point that we got from a nun.

535
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:15,584
Scott: I still know the difference between a gerbil and a hamster.

536
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:16,730
Scott: Isn't it the same fucking thing there?

537
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,438
Rym: They're completely different animals.

538
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,110
Rym: They're not even remotely close to each other.

539
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:28,094
Rym: okay, a hamster imagine like a tiny little bear a Gerbil imagine like our.

540
00:40:28,736 --> 00:40:33,130
Rym: take a rat and a squirrel mash them together and make them bitey.

541
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:40,448
Rym: They're cute Not super like human focused smart compared to a lot of other small animals like that.

542
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:46,659
Rym: Honestly, I don't think gerbils make good pets for like most people I think they should be treated more like an exotic pet.

543
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,988
Rym: hamsters are much easier for people to deal with.

544
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:56,810
Rym: I think Gerbils require special cages or you can literally drive them insane for reasons I don't really want to get into but we got these gerbils found.

545
00:40:56,911 --> 00:41:03,536
Scott: I always found those interesting the hamster and the gerbil because I've never seen them out in the wild ever.

546
00:41:03,556 --> 00:41:06,304
Rym: Oh, I've seen wild.

547
00:41:06,806 --> 00:41:08,270
Rym: I've never seen a wild gerbil in person.

548
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,418
Rym: I've seen wild hamsters in a zoo before.

549
00:41:10,438 --> 00:41:13,610
Rym: I've never encountered an actual wild hamster on my own in the wild.

550
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:17,363
Scott: Yeah, it's like I don't know like I'm talking like out in the wild.

551
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:18,910
Scott: It's like where did these animals come from?

552
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,195
Scott: I'm sure I can all different place.

553
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:23,810
Scott: Like I've only ever seen them as pets in a cage in someone's house, you know?

554
00:41:24,212 --> 00:41:27,247
Scott: Oh, yeah, I know I've seen guinea pigs in the wild.

555
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:32,396
Rym: Yeah, yeah But I think The like not actually not.

556
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:37,349
Scott: I haven't personally seen them in the wild but I've seen in the wild on you know video.

557
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:40,069
Rym: at one Point we had we had a little mouse who was our pet.

558
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,343
Rym: we rescued him from a tragic pet shop that the owner.

559
00:41:44,363 --> 00:41:52,210
Rym: and when we were kids because one thing my mom did one of her Jobs was basically rescuing animals from abusers and dangerous situations and like doing animal welfare stuff.

560
00:41:52,935 --> 00:42:01,910
Rym: and there was this one moment where a Owner of a pet store basically just gave up and just left just like abandoned a pet store full of animals to die.

561
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:09,610
Rym: So my mom was part of like that rescue effort and we adopted a little mouse From that among some other animals that we helped foster.

562
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,416
Rym: I forget I'm actually trying to.

563
00:42:11,757 --> 00:42:17,015
Rym: I'm old enough to not be able to fully piece together chronologies from my youth But I think that's the same time.

564
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,099
Rym: We got our second love bird.

565
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,290
Rym: I think frisbee also came from that pet store if I recall correctly.

566
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:36,614
Rym: But I think that class of like small animal that is Reasonably durable and doesn't require super specialized knowledge to take care of and only lives a couple of years is probably like.

567
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:50,164
Rym: I think there's something good for Children to be able to experience that and also honestly to experience that loss and to learn about like the real world and death And everything along the way without also having the commitment of that.

568
00:42:50,184 --> 00:42:51,670
Rym: chinchilla is gonna live 20 more years.

569
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:55,092
Rym: That's something I've noticed.

570
00:42:55,153 --> 00:43:10,578
Rym: a lot of people Will like a lot of people who which chinchilla is I think specifically Don't actually know how long they live and assume that they live like a hamster or a gerbil or or a squirrel or something And then discover that they can live a lot longer and don't know what to do.

571
00:43:11,563 --> 00:43:13,274
Scott: That seems to have a parent and out lives you.

572
00:43:13,294 --> 00:43:16,860
Rym: Oh, yeah Dusty we got dusty when I was very young.

573
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,986
Rym: My mom still has dusty.

574
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:23,035
Rym: dusty will probably outlive both my parents the way Parrots tend to go dusty the bird outlive.

575
00:43:23,075 --> 00:43:23,700
Scott: dusty the dog.

576
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:28,775
Rym: Yeah, dusty the bird still remembers me to this day despite the fact that I don't see dusty very often.

577
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:31,764
Rym: It's really funny and cute Mm-hmm.

578
00:43:31,804 --> 00:43:32,686
Scott: Why wouldn't they yeah?

579
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:36,475
Rym: Well, it's not every animal would necessarily remember that kind of thing.

580
00:43:36,515 --> 00:43:38,600
Rym: like different animals have different relationships with humans.

581
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:49,920
Rym: but One thing that's it's interesting how in America There's certain pets that society just treats as standard and people have a lot of basic knowledge.

582
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:56,530
Rym: like a lot of people get dogs and cats and hamsters and They don't know anything about those animals at all.

583
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,100
Rym: like a parent's getting for their kid like oh kids should have a pen.

584
00:43:59,561 --> 00:44:01,087
Rym: I'll go to the Petco and get a pet.

585
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:08,460
Rym: or in the old days before a lot of places started banning this go to like One of those dodgy pet stores like literally in a mall to get like a dog.

586
00:44:09,186 --> 00:44:10,478
Scott: There was a pet store in the mall.

587
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:13,852
Scott: there Lived for quite a while right, but it's like yeah, you know people.

588
00:44:13,872 --> 00:44:15,660
Scott: I think people just don't think too hard about it.

589
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,950
Scott: They're like you know buy a dog all right.

590
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,618
Scott: You know you got to buy dog food.

591
00:44:19,678 --> 00:44:22,320
Scott: obviously You know give it water, and you're in the pet store.

592
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:24,846
Scott: What else you got to do?

593
00:44:24,866 --> 00:44:26,353
Scott: yeah, what else you got to do?

594
00:44:26,674 --> 00:44:29,876
Scott: take it to the vet one time You know and then you're good to go.

595
00:44:29,896 --> 00:44:33,429
Rym: yep And the problem is they just even those animals do require.

596
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,880
Rym: a lot of people have problems especially with a lot of dogs and cats.

597
00:44:37,402 --> 00:44:51,690
Rym: Where the problem is they don't actually know shit about dogs and cats and they do the wrong thing Feed the wrong food train the wrong way and cause interesting social or physical Disorders in the animals that end up like.

598
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:56,018
Rym: a lot of problematic behavior of pets usually comes from owners Not actually knowing about those animals.

599
00:44:56,982 --> 00:45:01,476
Scott: Yeah, a lot of times people will you know and you'll hear people say like oh my you know like.

600
00:45:01,496 --> 00:45:02,720
Scott: they'll say little act like.

601
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,655
Scott: It's just the nature of their animal.

602
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:09,567
Scott: like you know Like yeah is your dog my dog isn't.

603
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:11,613
Scott: my dog is not very social.

604
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:13,900
Scott: It's like he doesn't go well with other dogs.

605
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,880
Rym: Have you ever introduced him to another dog?

606
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:18,760
Scott: How did your dog get that way?

607
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:21,586
Scott: You know?

608
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:29,425
Rym: yep, uh But at least with those animals so many people have them and so much like.

609
00:45:29,525 --> 00:45:34,957
Rym: really basic knowledge is in popular culture that a Lot of people do well enough.

610
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:44,609
Rym: so those animals don't particularly suffer even if they're not necessarily raised particularly Well, like they might eat bad food and have like some minor health problems, but they tend to do also.

611
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:54,570
Scott: There's that also there's enough infrastructure around those Grocery store, there's dog food in this cat food at the grocery store, right?

612
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:59,630
Scott: You know if you go to a vet even in the middle of nowhere, they know what to do with a cat or a dog.

613
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:07,818
Scott: You know, it's common right if you show up with your I don't know monkey to the vet and you know Just a standard vet in a suburb.

614
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,790
Scott: They're gonna be like, I don't know what to do with monkey.

615
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:11,716
Rym: Yeah The classification there you'll.

616
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:23,230
Rym: you'll notice that normal vets will usually only be able to handle Dogs cats and a small number of other common animals and most other animals you might have as a pet are technically classified as exotics.

617
00:46:23,774 --> 00:46:25,247
Rym: Many vets will not treat them at all.

618
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:30,346
Rym: Some vets will treat them but they'll warn you like yeah, I'm gonna do the best I can like.

619
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:38,150
Rym: I'm not an expert here But like for even rabbits like we have to take the rabbit to a specialized vet that can handle exotics.

620
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:42,385
Scott: And then there's the other kind of animal like, you know, gerbil hamster where it's like.

621
00:46:42,586 --> 00:46:43,530
Scott: do you really take it to the vet?

622
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,197
Scott: It's sort of like I think you should.

623
00:46:46,217 --> 00:46:49,847
Rym: I think generally it's sort of an aside goldfish goldfish.

624
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:50,810
Scott: Don't go to the vet, right?

625
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:51,488
Scott: It's it's a gold.

626
00:46:53,110 --> 00:47:03,157
Rym: Those goldfish goldfish can live a long time and have a very different Profile from what most people think is most people drastically Terribly mistreat goldfish, right?

627
00:47:03,177 --> 00:47:03,678
Scott: So we got.

628
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,123
Scott: so the fish I had right.

629
00:47:05,183 --> 00:47:07,170
Scott: so I wasn't even like planning to get fish.

630
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:13,570
Scott: But you know We were at like the perm festival Right and they had the old throw the ping-pong ball in and get a goldfish in a plastic bag.

631
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:14,613
Scott: So I got.

632
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:20,610
Scott: I got a goldfish in a plastic bag and then I put it in like a bowl of water, right?

633
00:47:21,651 --> 00:47:22,957
Scott: And then we went to the stood.

634
00:47:23,038 --> 00:47:25,006
Scott: there was a little aquarium store in the mall, right.

635
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:26,797
Scott: and I was like, all right What do I need for the?

636
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:28,329
Scott: you know, the goldfish see a little bowl?

637
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,270
Scott: Right and they're like you got to put in distilled water.

638
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,921
Scott: You can't be putting in your sink water.

639
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:34,069
Scott: and I was like, oh, yeah.

640
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:39,738
Scott: And then they were like, yeah, you also got to put this stuff in the water So the fish doesn't get.

641
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:40,904
Scott: there's a disease called ik.

642
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:43,152
Scott: Yeah Thanks.

643
00:47:43,974 --> 00:47:44,336
Scott: It's like.

644
00:47:44,576 --> 00:47:46,081
Scott: what disease could you come like that?

645
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:47,966
Scott: What is the most disease name?

646
00:47:47,986 --> 00:47:48,668
Scott: Right?

647
00:47:48,728 --> 00:47:50,982
Scott: It's like We need a disease name.

648
00:47:51,184 --> 00:47:51,729
Scott: He's got the ik.

649
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:55,963
Scott: It's a. basically the fish will get white spots and die.

650
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:57,310
Scott: I don't know what causes it or anything.

651
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:57,872
Scott: I'm not a vet.

652
00:47:57,932 --> 00:48:05,602
Scott: All I know is that if you see a white spots a little parasite like a malaria kind of thing Okay, if you see white spots on your goldfish, it's not good.

653
00:48:05,662 --> 00:48:07,974
Scott: Right and then it's like here Here's some fish food.

654
00:48:08,054 --> 00:48:08,697
Scott: Shake it in the bowl.

655
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:11,250
Scott: Once or once a day, you know, it's like, okay.

656
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:12,860
Scott: So we got the bowl and we did all.

657
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:23,373
Scott: I just followed the instructions, you know I did what they told me to and The fish lived and it got pretty big started as like the tiniest goldfish and then it was like a couple inches long Goldfish.

658
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:29,262
Scott: and then one day my mom came home from wherever she was and the goldfish was not in the bowl It was on the kitchen counter.

659
00:48:29,343 --> 00:48:30,230
Scott: So I guess he had a little jump.

660
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:36,607
Scott: So my mom picked it up and put it back in the bowl and it came back to life.

661
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:37,310
Scott: it wasn't dead.

662
00:48:38,852 --> 00:48:40,950
Scott: So we're like, well, I guess it doesn't fit in the bowl.

663
00:48:41,473 --> 00:48:44,610
Scott: So we would put like a cutting board so we couldn't jump out of the bowl.

664
00:48:46,895 --> 00:48:47,969
Scott: And then we got a fish tank.

665
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:55,136
Scott: so then we had this big old fish tank and honestly, I was actually more interested in the Bubbly treasure chest than the fish.

666
00:48:55,156 --> 00:49:08,450
Rym: Yeah, I honestly I generally find that fish aren't the best like fish teach different Sets of lessons to kids and I find a lot of kids seem to just get bored with fish After a certain point or a certain age unless they get into the technical aspects.

667
00:49:09,391 --> 00:49:16,978
Scott: Yeah, I was mostly you know, like I had a friend who was like aquarium nerd, you know, like he was into aquariums But I was just like it looks cool.

668
00:49:17,179 --> 00:49:19,066
Scott: I like it, you know, bubbly treasure chest.

669
00:49:19,187 --> 00:49:24,743
Scott: Awesome, you know But I didn't actually you know, it's like the fish is just fish.

670
00:49:25,024 --> 00:49:25,526
Scott: It's cool.

671
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:31,370
Scott: Watch it sometimes, you know I think like you're not like I'm making a relationship with the fish more interactive.

672
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:35,590
Rym: Cuddling with the fish I think like in general like other kinds of pets are just very much.

673
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:44,747
Rym: I think they can generally be a very positive influence on kids Like I know like the fact that we had pets my whole life Really shaped who I am as a person today.

674
00:49:44,787 --> 00:49:49,470
Rym: like that I think I might have ended up being a very different person had we not had so many pets and animals.

675
00:49:50,012 --> 00:49:58,179
Rym: because if you actually I've noticed most people who have problems with their pets another thing that they don't do is not just that they Don't learn like they don't have the book knowledge, but fine.

676
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:58,801
Rym: Sure.

677
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,510
Rym: They also just don't actually pay attention to their pets.

678
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:07,610
Rym: They don't actually like look at our pets behaving and think about like why is that dog doing that?

679
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,355
Rym: What's going on in their little brain?

680
00:50:09,395 --> 00:50:14,110
Rym: like try to understand and empathize and like deal with that?

681
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,510
Rym: A lot of people just don't and then they're surprised.

682
00:50:16,576 --> 00:50:24,138
Scott: Yeah the people are the people living their own lives and living the dog live their own life like it was a person and then only paying attention to the dog when it's like.

683
00:50:24,198 --> 00:50:25,623
Scott: I feel like having some dog time.

684
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:31,196
Scott: the same way you would feel like I Feel like reading that book on the shelf and then when you're not reading it It's on the shelf and I think

685
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:41,570
Rym: that attitude is less than it used to be but it was definitely exacerbated by the Proliferation of shitty like puppy mill pet stores in malls and places like that.

686
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:43,905
Rym: I'm glad we're moving toward banning that kind of pet store.

687
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:46,230
Scott: Yeah Yeah, we just to round out my fish story.

688
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:47,878
Scott: So that fish was in that tank.

689
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:48,903
Scott: right lucky the fish.

690
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:52,510
Scott: and then we got a sec We're like, well, we got this big old fish tank now, right?

691
00:50:52,590 --> 00:51:01,221
Scott: So we got a second goldfish a fancy-looking one and then we got a tiny little I don't know if it's technically a catfish But it looked like a catfish and it was really tiny and cuz.

692
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:06,485
Scott: it was supposed to supposedly like, you know Eat a lot of the dirt towards the bottom of the tank, which it did.

693
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:08,273
Rym: Oh, yeah bottom fitter That's your.

694
00:51:08,293 --> 00:51:14,317
Rym: you were getting towards starting to make like a mini ecosystem, which is how yeah I'm a real aquarium has to be managed.

695
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:21,560
Scott: Yeah, but anyway the point that all that happened was the The fancy goldfish and the little catfish looking guy.

696
00:51:22,262 --> 00:51:25,030
Scott: They both died before the original fish died.

697
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:30,957
Scott: The original fish last of the longest was eventually alone Right all by himself.

698
00:51:30,997 --> 00:51:36,781
Scott: this this goldfish that you got for free at the at the carnival For like a ping-pong ball right.

699
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:38,890
Scott: that shouldn't have lived more than like a week.

700
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:42,343
Scott: I imagine none of the other fish at that little carnival probably survived.

701
00:51:42,363 --> 00:51:49,321
Scott: a week lasted many years And then even though we kept doing every it preventative measure.

702
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:51,286
Scott: They got the egg, right?

703
00:51:51,386 --> 00:51:53,986
Scott: So I Guess the egg is unavoidable.

704
00:51:54,067 --> 00:52:02,343
Rym: Yep It's one thing that a lot of people who get pets especially when a family gets a pet for a kid Especially a longer-lived pet like not a hamster or something smaller.

705
00:52:03,006 --> 00:52:05,535
Rym: They tend to also like.

706
00:52:05,596 --> 00:52:12,086
Rym: there's a certain amount of Gross or grim animal husbandry knowledge that honestly people should know.

707
00:52:12,648 --> 00:52:24,528
Rym: like when I was a kid You could definitely tell the people who had read at least one book that talked about the serious real stuff about dogs versus the people who had never done that and relied on their vets for anything like those are the people like.

708
00:52:24,568 --> 00:52:27,800
Rym: the latter were the People who like didn't know they had to clip their dog's nails.

709
00:52:27,841 --> 00:52:31,633
Rym: like that kind of nonsense would happen, but also like Guy kind of.

710
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:33,301
Scott: I don't know too many people like that everyone.

711
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:34,245
Scott: I know is like fuck.

712
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:35,269
Scott: I hate clipping the dog's name.

713
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,315
Rym: Yeah, oh god.

714
00:52:36,355 --> 00:52:37,581
Rym: I hate dying you.

715
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,390
Rym: you think living a dog's nails is a pain in the ass?

716
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,130
Rym: It's got clipping a rabbit's nails.

717
00:52:41,531 --> 00:52:45,243
Rym: Most rabbits do not fucking want you to clip their nails and they can kick.

718
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:48,777
Rym: you don't say they can kick way harder than you Would expect for a tiny little guy.

719
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:49,923
Scott: you're huge.

720
00:52:49,963 --> 00:52:53,930
Rym: They're tiny just just holding down Yeah, but they're also fragile can't hold them down too hard.

721
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:54,391
Rym: You got to be very.

722
00:52:54,412 --> 00:52:56,338
Rym: it's a delicate dance dog.

723
00:52:56,358 --> 00:52:59,890
Rym: You can just like wrestle them down and cut the nail tranquilizer.

724
00:53:00,731 --> 00:53:04,343
Scott: Yeah, so what's that thing people always post on the internet about cats like bunny burrito.

725
00:53:04,363 --> 00:53:05,206
Scott: That will mess you up.

726
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,370
Scott: be smart use drugs.

727
00:53:08,192 --> 00:53:15,180
Rym: I Like the the the burrito method of you wrap the small animal in basically a blanket and then pull the little leggy out And that's how you do it.

728
00:53:16,271 --> 00:53:20,230
Scott: Well, there's also that thing like you grab a cat in a certain way, and then they just don't move get him by the scruff.

729
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:21,562
Rym: Yeah, yep.

730
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:27,266
Rym: But yeah, basically that kind of knowledge like it should be more normalized.

731
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:30,970
Rym: learning that stuff Even though some of it is gross and terrifying.

732
00:53:31,632 --> 00:53:40,470
Rym: It's kind of your responsibility if you're gonna have a pet to know at least like more about the pet Same as if like not to compare to a car which is a very different thing.

733
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:41,509
Rym: The car doesn't have feelings.

734
00:53:42,032 --> 00:53:52,276
Rym: But if you're gonna have a car you should at least know the bare minimum about how that thing works or else it's gonna run down and break way earlier than you'd expect or you're gonna go to a Mechanic way too late.

735
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:54,590
Rym: I know a lot of money and not understand what you're paying for.

736
00:53:55,213 --> 00:54:05,729
Rym: There's a lot of tragic situations where people take a pet to the vet way too late And what would have been a $50 thing is now a $3,000 thing or a very sad conversation with the family.

737
00:54:07,072 --> 00:54:17,430
Scott: You know the fact that you said the word animal husbandry made me think of a nerdy thing which is in Civilization 6 the first three the first three technologies that you research in civilization 6.

738
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,635
Scott: It's the first three available.

739
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:24,238
Scott: And so the most basic ones are animal husbandry Mining and pottery.

740
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:29,819
Scott: right and even someone even me It's like do I know pottery?

741
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,763
Scott: not really?

742
00:54:30,943 --> 00:54:31,686
Scott: No, it's like.

743
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:32,670
Scott: do I know mining?

744
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,096
Scott: Not really.

745
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:35,689
Scott: Do I know animal husbandry?

746
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,696
Scott: Not really.

747
00:54:37,756 --> 00:54:38,058
Scott: It's like.

748
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:39,327
Scott: those are the three basic one.

749
00:54:39,347 --> 00:54:46,410
Scott: Yes I Don't think sib6 should be like the defining, you know, the sib6 text tree should define.

750
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:56,489
Scott: You know how we should behave as a society, but the fact that most people Self-included don't know all that much about those three basic things.

751
00:54:57,432 --> 00:55:08,230
Rym: I remember what I did my thing today a while ago about a tackle block like the practical use of police like That knowledge does not exist in a lot of people's heads because they don't have to do it on a day-to-day basis.

752
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:09,938
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

753
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:12,470
Scott: it's like writing might be the earliest one actually.

754
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,910
Rym: Oh Yeah, thea ours are our rabbits.

755
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:19,710
Rym: Oh, we only have one rabbit or movie now.

756
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,249
Rym: But Theo his thing was he hated his nails getting clipped and he was mad about it.

757
00:55:23,752 --> 00:55:24,518
Rym: But he didn't like.

758
00:55:25,043 --> 00:55:29,304
Rym: when we clipped his nails It wasn't like he'd bite us while we're clipping them like panicking or anything.

759
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:30,590
Rym: Like we'd get him clipped.

760
00:55:31,332 --> 00:55:55,048
Rym: he would after the nail clipping was done like make a face and Like with malice a forethought Bite us or bite a nearby thing on purpose as an act of anger and/or revenge like it was so clearly Intentional and so clearly in response to what we had done as opposed to oh, no I'm freaking out and I bit you but more like fuck you mom and dad bite

761
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:57,013
Scott: What did?

762
00:55:57,174 --> 00:56:00,210
Scott: what do bunnies do out in the wild if there's no one clipping their name?

763
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:03,488
Rym: They only live two years out in the wild at best so they don't need it.

764
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,549
Rym: Also, they wear him down by digging and scraping and stuff.

765
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:07,955
Scott: Why don't you give.

766
00:56:07,995 --> 00:56:10,430
Scott: let him have some digging and scraping then you may even clip less often.

767
00:56:10,592 --> 00:56:13,885
Rym: Oh, yeah, but it's still not enough like clip You're still gonna have to clip at some point at least.

768
00:56:13,905 --> 00:56:14,329
Rym: check out him.

769
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,960
Scott: Give him a diggin a diggin scraping rocks and really where isn't?

770
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,469
Rym: actually you can't and that reduces how often you gotta gotta clip them.

771
00:56:20,153 --> 00:56:21,781
Rym: But that's something people to underestimate too.

772
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,469
Rym: Like how long do you think a squirrel lives?

773
00:56:26,251 --> 00:56:36,630
Scott: I mean judging by the fact that there was one black squirrel in the park nearby and I saw it for at least You know four or five years in a row it's got to be at least that much probably.

774
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,113
Scott: Yeah, they could.

775
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:39,970
Rym: they could live like especially if they don't get sick or eaten by something.

776
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:45,502
Scott: I don't think there were two black squirrels in the same tree in the same park in consecutive years and it was a different one.

777
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:46,226
Rym: a good observation.

778
00:56:46,246 --> 00:56:51,126
Rym: they can live like 14 to 20 years if they're well cared for like rabbits still like in the wild.

779
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:55,303
Rym: they make it like a year Maybe two just because it's so dangerous to be a rabbit in a house.

780
00:56:55,584 --> 00:56:56,649
Rym: They can live more than ten years.

781
00:56:56,689 --> 00:57:04,030
Rym: Just fine Okay Put a human naked out in the woods and got to survive on your own your whole life.

782
00:57:04,532 --> 00:57:05,475
Rym: Not that likely.

783
00:57:05,495 --> 00:57:07,743
Rym: you're gonna make it past like 30-something probably.

784
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:09,189
Scott: Well, not a domesticated human.

785
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:14,305
Scott: but is that rabbit that lives two years in the wild like dying on its own?

786
00:57:14,385 --> 00:57:16,453
Scott: or is it cuz it got eaten if Never gets?

787
00:57:16,573 --> 00:57:18,821
Scott: if it if it doesn't got eaten by anything.

788
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:21,009
Scott: Yeah, how long will it go for?

789
00:57:22,394 --> 00:57:28,630
Rym: Not eaten but also like malnutrition or just like they are more susceptible to illnesses when they get older just like humans are.

790
00:57:28,972 --> 00:57:40,933
Rym: Like if I eat some rotting meat when I was 15 I could probably survive that if I had a bunch of rotting meat today I might not look so good compared to how I would have handled that when I was 17.

791
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:47,522
Scott: Eat some rotting meat when you're your 60s like yeah Yeah, I don't know if you know the building we're in now.

792
00:57:47,663 --> 00:57:49,230
Scott: actually you can bring a pet here.

793
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,740
Scott: They actually only charge.

794
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,022
Scott: they don't.

795
00:57:51,163 --> 00:57:54,670
Scott: a lot of buildings in the city They want to make you have a pet fee where you can all the time.

796
00:57:55,071 --> 00:58:00,870
Scott: This building just has pet deposit where you pay one time and they just told that money like that and that's your pet doesn't?

797
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:02,356
Rym: That's fairly fair.

798
00:58:02,758 --> 00:58:05,450
Scott: I'm a building is the building's full of pets.

799
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:08,628
Scott: There's you know this dog and as long as your pet doesn't make trouble they don't give a shit.

800
00:58:08,728 --> 00:58:09,050
Scott: our building.

801
00:58:09,691 --> 00:58:10,796
Scott: There's also a size limit.

802
00:58:10,816 --> 00:58:11,761
Scott: I guess I don't know what it is.

803
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:17,349
Rym: pets are technically not allowed in our building But there are a lot of pets in our building cuz the super literally doesn't care at all.

804
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:19,735
Rym: But we're looking around.

805
00:58:19,755 --> 00:58:27,405
Rym: there's some pet friendly buildings in the area and Rents are way down in this neighborhood like right now for a short time.

806
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:31,368
Scott: Yeah, I got a Yeah better leave now.

807
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:33,196
Scott: But yeah, it's like I don't know.

808
00:58:33,216 --> 00:58:33,738
Scott: What do we?

809
00:58:33,759 --> 00:58:35,930
Scott: you know Amanda had like corgis?

810
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,479
Scott: I guess her parents just keep getting more for some reason.

811
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,249
Scott: Yeah, because they're they're losing it.

812
00:58:41,891 --> 00:58:43,916
Rym: I mean all like most ever of my family.

813
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:46,783
Rym: Just keep getting pets cuz just I don't know pet.

814
00:58:46,843 --> 00:58:48,509
Scott: It's like should I get one.

815
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:49,814
Scott: It's like on the one hand.

816
00:58:49,914 --> 00:58:52,788
Scott: Maybe yes, but on the other hand It's like I.

817
00:58:52,808 --> 00:58:58,294
Rym: you know if you two had a pet It would be a very enriching experience cuz it's still a pain in the ass.

818
00:58:58,335 --> 00:58:59,580
Scott: the problem is like a pain in the ass.

819
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,829
Scott: Oh, it is invention.

820
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,140
Scott: someone's got to watch the pet.

821
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:07,380
Rym: I mean think of it this way though like if you had a kid that's a lot more responsibility.

822
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,783
Scott: No, no We're not doing that.

823
00:59:08,823 --> 00:59:09,806
Scott: forget that nonsense.

824
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:12,093
Rym: think about it as like it.

825
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:17,392
Rym: you get some of those kinds of benefits And some of that pain in the ass, but it's way less.

826
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:18,316
Scott: one in someone's.

827
00:59:18,376 --> 00:59:19,360
Scott: one person works at night.

828
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,445
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh great.

829
00:59:20,485 --> 00:59:21,288
Scott: So I got to take care.

830
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,698
Scott: I got to do all the pet taking care of is you know?

831
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:25,739
Scott: Well, we just split money's not a problem.

832
00:59:26,081 --> 00:59:30,780
Scott: Yeah, like I uh, well if someone we have one imagine if you were only awake at like night.

833
00:59:31,302 --> 00:59:34,600
Rym: Well, you could get a patty that is of crepuscular and is awake both times.

834
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:38,652
Scott: You got it, but you can't take it to the vet at night.

835
00:59:38,934 --> 00:59:41,392
Rym: or you know, yeah You shouldn't have to take it to the vet.

836
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:47,240
Scott: that often I'm just saying is that the responsibilities of take, you know, you got you get a dog, right?

837
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,719
Scott: You're you're not walking it, you know, well morning, right?

838
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:50,924
Rym: Well, that's the like.

839
00:59:51,366 --> 00:59:52,954
Rym: if we got a dog because one person's

840
00:59:52,994 --> 00:59:56,068
Scott: doing several dog walks The other person is doing not so much

841
00:59:56,088 --> 01:00:06,460
Rym: like because we both work and it's not like eventually cope It'll be a post-covid time where we're out of the house all the time Like I would probably literally drop a dog off at doggy daycare all day every day while we were at work.

842
01:00:07,442 --> 01:00:08,940
Scott: It's like, you know, doggy daycare is nice.

843
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,889
Scott: I actually saw a photo today of like, you know the world's I Assume the world's best dog walker.

844
01:00:13,929 --> 01:00:16,240
Scott: There's like the semi-famous dog walker in the city.

845
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:19,891
Scott: They walk like a huge pile of dogs at once.

846
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:22,840
Scott: It's sort of amazing, but they only they're very picky.

847
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,360
Scott: They're like they won't walk the dog unless it's like the best dog.

848
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:35,446
Scott: So it's like this person's walking around with like the 10 or 11 best dogs that meet their approval all at once, you know But rather more than once a day.

849
01:00:35,526 --> 01:00:44,041
Rym: probably like not just because I really like rabbits like because you know Every type of animal like whatever kind of pet you're gonna get you just have to learn about that kind of animal like.

850
01:00:44,101 --> 01:00:53,949
Rym: I had to learn a lot about rabbits about a decade ago when we got two little bunnies because I didn't know a lot about rabbits, but Rabbits are very Specifically good as New York pets.

851
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:58,309
Rym: just because they're silent They don't really cause a bunch of damage.

852
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,635
Rym: They're litter trainable.

853
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:00,620
Rym: Like they'll just you can just train them.

854
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,531
Rym: They'll just go in a litter box.

855
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:02,239
Rym: Just like a cat would.

856
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:05,009
Rym: Their poop doesn't smell like anything at all.

857
01:01:05,069 --> 01:01:07,400
Rym: Like the poop like if their pee smells a little in the litter box.

858
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:09,428
Scott: Yeah, does your apartment?

859
01:01:09,468 --> 01:01:11,235
Scott: your apartment didn't smell like poop ever.

860
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:12,058
Scott: It smelled like hay.

861
01:01:12,078 --> 01:01:14,532
Rym: Yep That hay is a very fairly pleasant smell.

862
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:15,920
Rym: It's like it almost smells like matcha like.

863
01:01:18,422 --> 01:01:20,410
Scott: I'd rather not smell the hay, but there's.

864
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:20,652
Scott: it's.

865
01:01:20,993 --> 01:01:21,455
Scott: you know, it's not.

866
01:01:21,656 --> 01:01:22,821
Scott: it's not a bad smell Like.

867
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:24,045
Rym: I mean go to like my house.

868
01:01:24,085 --> 01:01:28,820
Rym: when we were kids the house smelled like dogs because we had dogs dog house.

869
01:01:29,822 --> 01:01:34,140
Scott: Yeah, I would rather hay smell than dog smell but I would still rather no smell than hay smell.

870
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:36,560
Rym: Yeah, but it's just especially during COVID.

871
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,615
Rym: Just having a little guy like mooching around the house has been a very enriching like.

872
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:43,586
Rym: it honestly helped us Just stay sane during this whole experience.

873
01:01:44,128 --> 01:01:53,642
Rym: I only worry that he's gonna be mad if we start going to work again Because he's really used to like I'll be working and he'll just like wake up and come into the computer room and be like, hey What's up?

874
01:01:54,706 --> 01:01:58,943
Scott: I Didn't really work out too.

875
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:03,759
Scott: Well, but I think in our lifetime we could have a robot dog that doesn't suck.

876
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:06,185
Scott: Yeah, it's possibility.

877
01:02:06,225 --> 01:02:09,013
Rym: Look at how many people are emotionally attached to their Roombas like.

878
01:02:09,274 --> 01:02:09,695
Rym: seriously.

879
01:02:09,735 --> 01:02:17,991
Scott: I'm not even joking like that's a thing Yeah, and it's like it's not even to say that like you might be thinking like, oh, you know You just want the robot dog because you're lazy.

880
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,560
Scott: It's like well, hold on a second.

881
01:02:19,661 --> 01:02:30,180
Scott: There are people who are lazy who don't want to have to take care of it as much But there's also people who might need the companionship of a pet but are incapable of taking care of it.

882
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:40,540
Rym: that feels of AI driven Companion is a big field of study Especially for people who are very old who might be experiencing cognitive deficits.

883
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:48,699
Scott: I'm seeing very senior or disabled person can you know be helped a great deal by like a nice doggo Yeah, but they can't take care of the doggo.

884
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:53,760
Scott: So suddenly now if they want to have one they got to have money to have someone else take care of the doggo.

885
01:02:54,282 --> 01:02:55,388
Scott: And it's like it's a whole thing.

886
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,298
Scott: But you know, what solves that robot doggo.

887
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:02,280
Scott: Yeah At least it has to be good enough though that it actually, you know serves the purpose.

888
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:08,357
Rym: But I uh, I think it's because having pets is also something that's very.

889
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,240
Rym: it's not uniquely human.

890
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:15,577
Rym: There are other animals that have done similar husbandry type things But humans like weak and well because we've killed time enough.

891
01:03:15,618 --> 01:03:18,104
Rym: on this episode We co-evolved

892
01:03:18,144 --> 01:03:18,846
Scott: with dogs

893
01:03:18,926 --> 01:03:33,218
Rym: like we've made dogs over time like they evolved with us and we kind of made them More able to socialize with us in a really interesting weird way Which is part of why I think dogs are the most common most popular like just out there.

894
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:37,119
Rym: pet Mm-hmm cats are a decent number two.

895
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:39,264
Scott: Yeah, we got horses too.

896
01:03:39,646 --> 01:03:40,830
Rym: But what about the ethical concerns?

897
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:52,037
Rym: What if you have an AI robot dog that can learn and Eventually starts to get to the level of Apparent intelligence of a small animal a real one?

898
01:03:52,218 --> 01:03:52,600
Rym: then what?

899
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,684
Scott: Good, it'll live forever.

900
01:03:54,704 --> 01:03:55,587
Scott: It'll be friggin awesome.

901
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:57,333
Rym: Yeah, but what did you?

902
01:03:57,353 --> 01:03:59,080
Rym: can you throw it away now ethics start coming in?

903
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:00,482
Scott: It doesn't.

904
01:04:00,563 --> 01:04:02,498
Scott: if you throw I mean, it'll be able to take care of us all.

905
01:04:04,906 --> 01:04:06,319
Rym: All right, we don't even have to find food.

906
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:08,240
Rym: We killed enough time.

907
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:14,346
Rym: I'm gonna go give my little rabbit in there some pellets and a couple crazins and then I'm gonna Watch the Rangers.

908
01:04:14,366 --> 01:04:15,008
Rym: I don't know.

909
01:04:15,028 --> 01:04:16,956
Rym: I was about to say lose, but I don't know.

910
01:04:16,976 --> 01:04:17,840
Rym: I don't know how this game will go.

911
01:04:18,382 --> 01:04:19,144
Scott: It's the Flyers will.

912
01:04:19,164 --> 01:04:22,154
Rym: probably I feel like we'll win but you know what it'll.

913
01:04:22,174 --> 01:04:26,429
Rym: probably I'll bet it'll be a moderate blowout But not a crazy blowout like four to one is my game.

914
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:34,160
Rym: We really we really did bad things to them I know but I feel like they had to have studied those games like what were we doing?

915
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,017
Rym: But it might be like like we are with Ovi like.

916
01:04:37,279 --> 01:04:41,498
Scott: well I could go so I can go so I can go watch the counter-strike world championships a thousand times.

917
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:43,886
Rym: Yeah Like everyone knows Ovi.

918
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:44,529
Rym: He's there.

919
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,780
Rym: He goes to that spot and then he scores a goal.

920
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,308
Rym: Just don't let him go to that spot.

921
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:51,578
Rym: and then they scores the goal from that spot and the coach is like What did I fucking say?

922
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,785
Rym: Do you want to watch the video again?

923
01:04:54,046 --> 01:04:54,468
