Rym: I like Repeatedly the same way that happened to us with the prince of nothing book.

13
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:19,768
Scott: It's better to be in their position where you watch it for the first time and then talk about who the people who are already bored of it.

14
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:29,057
Rym: The thing is sometimes when you do that you get in a situation where you're like, man I just saw a cool thing and the prince of nothing and they're like, yeah Well, you haven't gotten to the cool part yet.

29
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:10,289

169
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:15,808

174
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:34,706

175
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:39,119
Rym: Licenses bikes, it's ridiculous.

176
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:49,250
Rym: Yeah, but regardless Bike thieves are one of the few exceptions I might add to my list of things that are worth corporal punishment for when the thieves are caught.

177
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:53,063
Scott: Do we just set up bikes like bait bikes and they're electrified exactly.

178
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,689
Scott: Yeah, you just die if you touch them.

179
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:59,910
Scott: Or if you touch them for longer than sir or if you try to actually ride them you die.

180
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:03,544
Rym: How about one that just clamps you to it or explodes or no?

181
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:08,609
Scott: if you actually try to bike on it Like it's X when you're sitting on it and a knife comes out the seat right up in your ass?

182
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:14,389
Scott: That way you can't possibly accidentally hurt someone with it who doesn't deserve it.

183
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:25,859
Rym: what if a poor beat cop chasing down a serial like double murderer is Tries to commandeer that bike is a tied up and locked.

184
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,621
Scott: How's he gonna get it?

185
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:32,023
Scott: He uses his bike commandeering equipment By the time he undoes the bike.

186
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:33,129
Scott: It's the guys gone.

187
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:37,730
Rym: There's some exigent circumstance that cause you use your cop car or your cop bike.

188
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:51,220
Rym: So, yeah, so if you see this guy's bike anyway things of the day.

189
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:53,567
Rym: So this is not related to anything.

190
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,209
Rym: We've talked about.

191
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:07,083
Rym: this is a documentary from vice vice comm vice Came out of nowhere and went from shock journalism to some of the best journalism or investigative journalism I've seen in Recent memory.

192
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:11,380
Scott: I mean I watched one about this crazy drug in Colombia and it seemed true.

193
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,363
Scott: But I'm still.

194
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:12,664
Scott: it's.

195
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:17,320
Scott: it's weird because it's like they have these documentaries about the crazy underworld in real life.

196
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:23,465
Scott: But it's like so unbelievable, which is why it's compelling, but it's also Slightly unbelievable.

197
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:23,706
Rym: Yeah.

198
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:28,500

199
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:28,861
Rym: That's.

200
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:29,664
Scott: yeah, it's the one I saw.

00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:31,592
Rym: Yeah, but you know what Google image search for that.

202
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:33,640
Rym: That is not much of an exaggeration.

00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:35,325
Scott: Was that the same?

204
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:36,351
Scott: it might have been a different drug.

205
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:37,780
Rym: the one there was a different one.

206
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,856
Scott: You barely get any of it and you could die but also mostly just lets you control people.

207
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:43,277
Rym: Yes.

208
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:44,000
Rym: That's a different one.

209
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:47,053

215
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,660
Rym: Do not actually Google image search for crocodile like really you might you might not be happy.

216

222
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:38,980

Rym: This is pretty cool.

251
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:01,071

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,763
Scott: Well guy had a gun.

256
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:21,419

270
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,560
Scott: I think you're the one who would be unhappy.

271
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:56,176

272
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,239
Scott: I'll win easily.

273
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,625

274
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:06,200
Rym: the book club book is a canicle for Liebowitz the precursor to all modern post-apocalyptic science fiction.

275
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,417
Rym: Pretty much started the genre of me and play God destroy the world.

276
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:13,711
Scott: post-apocalypse I don't know.

277
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:15,000
Scott: I'm talking about one.

278
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:25,469
Scott: I don't think it did post-apocalyptic in general I but I pretty sure it was the first one where the post-apocalyptic situation and Humanity is isolated in some way.

279
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,320
Rym: Well, I think it's partly that it was yield in society.

280
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:40,880
Rym: It was one of the earlier novels that moved from the old style story of apocalypse to this new style Mostly nuclear driven because we should go and try to find like an old like the first story.

281
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,474
Scott: That's truly post-apocalyptic.

282
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:45,382
Scott: the Bible It's up.

283
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,110
Scott: that's apocalyptic not post-apocalyptic post-apocalyptic.

284
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,096
Rym: the apocalypse happened in that story.

285
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:51,320
Rym: No is bullshit.

286
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:55,459
Rym: isolated human on a boat surviving the apocalypse.

287
00:16:56,781 --> 00:17:00,214
Scott: It's pretty much straight up saying mechanical for Liebowitz is a Noah's Ark metaphor.

288
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,637
Scott: Uh, yes And where all the animals at?

289
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:06,509

307
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,520
Rym: We would not be plugging it unduly.

308
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:02,780
Scott: I wouldn't go to it every year for X years in a row and do hard work to make it happen.

309
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:07,240
Rym: If it wasn't worthwhile if we ever lied to you about a convention, I rest my case.

310
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:12,300
Rym: And also just to bring it up again watch our show on shoujo kakamei utenna.

311
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:13,758
Rym: The 12th episode is online.

312
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,266
Rym: Share that shit around.

313
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:22,380
Rym: in fact share all of our videos on the reddits and all those places Because the more views they get the faster will crank those things out.

314
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:24,709
Rym: I've dumped a ton of videos on one.

315
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,180
Scott: make some of our shit so popular right on to work anymore.

316
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:35,740
Rym: Yeah, guys if we don't have to work anymore You realize there's GeekNights like multiple times a week reliably for the rest of your lives a multiple times a day.

317
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:38,228
Scott: More geek morning geek afternoon.

318
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:41,400
Rym: you realize I would just stream every video game.

319
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:43,669
Rym: All of them I would play.

320
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,697
Rym: I would let you guys pick.

321
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:48,784
Scott: I don't care RPGs every day.

322
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:54,160
Rym: yeah stream the RPGs I had time to set up like a studio to stream us playing burning wheel.

323
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:59,819
Scott: anyway anyway, so Bravest warriors.

324
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,710
Scott: So bravest warriors, it's a show.

325
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:06,080
Scott: I watched it when there was only one episode of it.

326
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,851
Scott: I was like hey, this is new show on YouTube, but it's like.

327
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:10,900
Scott: it's a real show that they're making for reals.

328
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:14,239
Scott: But the episode is short, but it's made by the Adventure Time guy.

329
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,609
Scott: Yeah, I just watch it on YouTube for free.

330
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,460
Rym: like I ignored it in the beginning because there was a lot of stuff on YouTube.

331
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:25,658
Rym: I didn't really put the pieces together I didn't realize there's the Adventure Time people right away, or at least I didn't realize the Pendleton Ward.

332
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:32,503
Rym: yeah, and then I sort of paid attention to it because Scott was watching it and It's awesome.

333
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,230
Rym: It's really awesome.

334
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:42,877
Scott: So it's it's a weird thing right because it's sort of Most things like this will give you some sort of like origin story for like what are the bravest warriors?

335
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:43,960
Scott: who are all these characters?

336
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,080
Scott: Right, but bravest warriors doesn't introduce anything.

337
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,812
Scott: It just puts you right in the middle of whatever it is.

338
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:51,620
Rym: the term for that is in media res.

339
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,189
Scott: No, it's not in media.

340
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,779
Scott: res is for like when you're in the middle of the act.

341
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:57,934
Rym: Action to some some episodes.

342
00:19:57,974 --> 00:20:02,700
Rym: it doesn't some episodes It does for almost every episode starts in the middle of like the one you just watched again.

343
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:10,832
Rym: It just starts in the middle of there in this crazy war with these bugs Sure, but in terms of character introductions, right?

344
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:13,318
Scott: It's not like oh by the way everyone.

345
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,160
Scott: This is cat bug.

346
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,329
Scott: It's just like they're hanging out and cat bug comes in.

347
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,293
Scott: It's like hey cat bug.

348
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:18,879
Rym: Don't hit me.

349
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:20,587
Scott: It's like they don't introduce this.

350
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:21,833
Scott: Where did this cat bug come from?

351
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:23,160
Scott: I didn't know they had a cat bug.

352
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,224
Scott: What is going on here?

353
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:28,260
Scott: and it's just there suddenly and then there's millions of merchandise about it out of nowhere.

354
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:28,682
Scott: the way

355
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:48,288
Rym: I described it originally after I'd watch a little bit of it was that take Adventure Time and pare it down to the essence of semi-random and humor like remove even the the Small framing story that season 1 episodes of Adventure Time had remove even that And that was what bravest warriors was.

356
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:55,960
Rym: but then it did the same thing Adventure Time did and got Increasingly plotty and serious and all these threads kind of came together.

357
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,720
Rym: But yet it didn't lose that start in the middle of something without any introduction or explanation.

358
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,685
Rym: Aspect that has got going for it.

359
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:07,020
Scott: pretty much every episode no matter what it has is some sort of monster of the week.

360
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:08,126
Scott: But it's they're not.

361
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:10,500
Scott: you're usually not monsters, right?

362
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:19,976
Scott: It's usually like like take for example the episode where they have to get the two Creatures that inhabit their butts to like fall in love during the whatever.

363
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:20,680
Rym: Oh my god.

364
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,117
Scott: It's like they're on a mission to save something or to help some alien somewhere, but it's very.

365
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:27,100
Scott: it's actually pretty rare.

366
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,580
Scott: I mean sometimes it is just go and shoot things like on a you know that kind of mission.

367
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:35,214
Scott: But even episode one it's like oh is a time-traveling thing to deal with.

368
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,020
Scott: what's the deal, right?

369
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,545
Scott: There's a lot of time travel going on in general.

370
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:43,960
Rym: I think what married me to the show was you're married now.

371
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:45,600
Scott: Yeah, where should I send the gift?

372
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:49,192
Rym: It was in that the first episode.

373
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:53,420
Rym: when they come into the room You know there's like this time paradox loop happening.

374
00:21:53,902 --> 00:22:01,937
Rym: And then when they come into the room and find themselves all dead in the room, and they're like yeah, nope I'm done Nothing to do with this.

375
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:05,678
Rym: Yeah, it's that kind of show mmm.

376
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:19,626
Rym: But I think what's interesting is I like you and other people were watching it further before I watched it So I'd see like the tail end of an episode and normally like I remember I'd see snippets of Adventure Time like I saw Before I watched the show.

377
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,637
Rym: I saw that like all the characters singing a song in front of a door.

378
00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:28,300
Rym: it looked really good But it looked like there'd been a whole bunch of character development and build up that led to that moment.

379
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:36,021
Rym: So it felt like that's something that happens later in a show like this and then watching the show again and seeing all the build-up To that.

380
00:22:36,664 --> 00:22:39,413
Rym: like that added a lot to it with this show.

381
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:57,759
Rym: if you catch the end of an episode and Then later you see the entire series there what that little bit you caught at the end of the episode is basically it Like I saw the bit about the paralyzed horse and then when I saw that whole episode I was like oh that was just in that one episode like just in that one part.

382
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:00,125
Scott: Have you seen all of season two?

383
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,939
Scott: I think I'm one episode behind okay, because there's more paralyzed horse then.

384
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:05,905
Rym: okay I'm one episode behind spoil.

385
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:07,411
Scott: Yeah, but it's like take for it.

386
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:08,575
Scott: It's weird.

387
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:21,980
Scott: I'd like in Adventure time I guess because it's longer because they have more episodes right they can really introduce something and Recurrent a bunch before bringing it back right, but like wanker shim, which is a big fucking deal.

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,251
Scott: It's always been wanker sure, but it's like.

389
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:25,678
Scott: when did he first appear in?

390
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:34,959
Scott: The butter lettuce episode in the best in the hollow John which is the best episode And he's just a dude in the hollow John is like there's nothing about him.

391
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:40,960
Scott: Right when a jelly kid appear the episode with the losing memory every dog on the spaceship, right?

392
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:47,567
Scott: and it's just oh, there's just some jelly kid on the thing and he ejects and There's nothing about him, but then later.

393
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:48,832
Scott: It's like jelly kids.

394
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:49,816
Scott: suddenly a big deal.

395
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:53,029
Scott: this character that Didn't even have any building.

396
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:53,974
Scott: It was just there.

397
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:58,532
Scott: like a second You know becomes like a whole episode later on or more.

398
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:00,438
Rym: yep, but oh, you're right.

399
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:08,913
Rym: cuz adventure time I think it's just more episodes, and they fill in the details like this show Just is like the peaks along the way of what would be a show.

400
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:11,762
Rym: you could have a show with the same pacing as adventure Time.

401
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:15,577
Rym: that was just bravest warriors filling in all the time between those points.

402
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,780
Rym: instead It's like they have this whole story, and they pick these points along the way, and they only animate those points.

403
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:22,133
Scott: Yeah, I have some of the comics.

404
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:22,780
Scott: I haven't read them.

405
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,870
Scott: I'm curious if the comics are just more bravest warriors Or if they fill in a lot of those blanks in between.

406
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,673
Scott: like are they Canon?

407
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:30,220
Rym: I almost don't want them to one thing I?

408
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:38,496
Rym: Like about bravest warriors that adventure time has its own lexicon like its own Language like P the way thin and people say things like that's Greece.

409
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:41,384
Scott: algebraic Mathematical said that in a while.

410
00:24:41,765 --> 00:24:43,470
Rym: yeah lately Greece has been the thing.

411
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:48,950
Rym: I've been saying that lately myself, but in this show Instead of doing that with adjectives.

412
00:24:49,392 --> 00:24:52,342
Rym: They've been doing it with straight-up nouns Mm-hmm.

413
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:58,760
Rym: I mean they'll be they'll be like blah blah blah the calliope of space And they just use these terms that literally mean nothing.

414
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,966
Rym: It's just the gobbledygook that you'd use in.

415
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:06,380
Rym: like Star Trek the next generation just applied whenever they needed some crab people nouns.

416
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:17,597
Scott: I thought like a lot of the sort of Technologies that go on that they somehow keep consistent right like they all have these basically Pokemon holograms in these gym.

417
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:20,005
Rym: that has zero Explanation right.

418
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:23,500
Scott: well, but they keep coming up and actually mattering a whole lot.

419
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:27,433
Scott: And yeah, and holograms have like mad powers.

420
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:34,180
Scott: apparently they can turn them into bazookas and wings And you know basically all these powers come from like these little pokemons that they have.

421
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:35,603
Scott: It's like whoa.

422
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:38,210
Scott: those things do a lot, but they're mostly there visually.

423
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:56,830
Scott: they rarely draw attention to them except for I think once when they're introduced And maybe one other time they're just always there, and if you don't actually look it's like oh he you know Chris always has the B and Dan always has the dog and Bets is a cat and wallow is The Eagle Hawk thing.

424
00:25:56,931 --> 00:26:02,815
Scott: yeah, whatever it is right It's like if you're not paying close attention you won't realize that or just the little things like.

425
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:13,020
Rym: all the characters are actually really well Developed, but you only see it through these little Snippet lenses like wallows got all those little animals hanging around him all the time like he collects little guys.

426
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:14,169
Scott: He's also the doctor.

427
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:17,467
Scott: yeah, I'm gonna Lee Even though he's the big guy.

428
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:20,300
Rym: He's walls are way better than Zoidberg ever was it being a doctor.

429
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:27,180
Rym: The level of technology they possess is approaching culture level - well I think it's right.

430
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:31,593
Scott: I guess the idea is that their parents were even better than them and we're like the real.

431
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:33,820
Scott: what were they called the courageous battlers?

432
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:36,397
Scott: Right yeah, and they're they guess their parent.

433
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:39,219
Scott: all this shit I think is their parents shit Which is why it's so fucking awesome.

434
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:46,559
Scott: And there's sort of like the half-assed people taking over for their parents and aren't as good and they often fail.

435
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:50,299
Scott: So I guess that's where all their cool stuff comes from.

436
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:54,035
Rym: Yeah, also just the level of technology in this world is pretty high.

437
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:57,746
Rym: That's also true But the only other really interesting.

438
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:59,633
Rym: I mean the episodes are so short.

439
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:03,759
Scott: if you they have a video That's watch all of season one in one video.

440
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,422
Scott: It's an hour.

441
00:27:04,603 --> 00:27:13,400
Rym: even if you could not ask yourself to watch all of adventure time with its short episodes Evens because there's so many of them you could watch this entire show.

442
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:17,578
Scott: You could watch almost all of season one in less time than it takes to all listen to this.

443
00:27:17,598 --> 00:27:24,692
Rym: GeekNights Exactly, and it's worth watching because this show And Frederator studios in general.

444
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:25,837
Scott: Well the cartoon hangover.

445
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:29,004
Rym: Yes are The like they're.

446
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:34,160
Rym: this is the model for how to do the equivalent of television in a future of technology.

447
00:27:34,341 --> 00:27:38,836
Scott: Yeah, make a show that's pretty relatively cheap to produce but still high quality.

448
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:46,618
Scott: put it on YouTube for free Everyone loves it and then sell a million zillion dollars of cat bug merchandise and more importantly invest in creating the show.

449
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:52,475
Rym: and Before you've made that money And if you know a bunch of the pilots fail who cares?

450
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:56,316
Rym: because the one that succeeds you're gonna sell a lot of cat bug backpacks.

451

457
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:20,099

460
00:28:25,797 --> 00:28:38,060
Rym: Yeah Cat bugs greatest moment was What also I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that they do the voice acting for some of these episodes all in the same room.

461
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,688
Rym: Yeah, like you should well like a lot of Japanese shows.

470
00:28:56,141 --> 00:29:00,320
Scott: Well, if they do it all at the same time that you're not multiplying 20 minutes times the number of people.
