1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,742
Rym: It's Tuesday January 29th 2019.

2
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:15,190
Rym: I'm Rym I'm scared and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,776
Rym: We are reviewing the 2014 board game.

4
00:00:18,197 --> 00:00:21,877
Scott: La Cosa Nostra Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,682 --> 00:00:29,840
Rym: We're finally fully back from all those Pax's all those mag fests all that biz.

6
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:33,735
Rym: All we got coming up is Pax East which won't significantly disrupt GeekNights.

7
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:40,440
Rym: Mm-hmm We would have done a show last week, maybe two shows, but I did get a Pax Fox.

8
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:43,080
Rym: It took a few days to kick in but I got a full-on Pax Fox.

9
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:44,691
Scott: There's a Pax Fox Twitter account.

10
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:45,799
Scott: if anyone it's pretty good.

11
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:54,125
Rym: I tweeted at that Twitter account and was like yo, I got the Pax Fox and it actually was like, thank you It's pretty good account.

12
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:56,215
Rym: I'm still fighting off the tail end of that Pax Fox.

13
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:57,120
Scott: Oh, why am I here?

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,126
Rym: Well, we'll see if Emily comes down with it.

15
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:00,969
Rym: Why am I here?

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,811
Rym: I don't know.

17
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:03,316
Scott: I'm unboxed.

18
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,743
Rym: Don't don't touch anything Okay.

19
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:09,500
Rym: Well, yeah, the thing is when I was sickest was when we skipped the show last week.

20
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,285
Rym: So stay tuned.

21
00:01:10,628 --> 00:01:14,665
Rym: our next Wednesday show will be Spider-man into the spider-verse.

22
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:20,625
Scott: I have basically no plans until like weekend plans until Pax East except for a few small things Nothing.

23
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:24,628
Scott: So there's gonna be a Consistent yeek nights now until March ish.

24
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:26,294
Rym: Yeah, so that'll be good times.

25
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:26,615
Rym: Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:28,763
Scott: So I guess president's day I don't have to work.

27
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:29,547
Scott: We'll see what goes around.

28
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,416
Rym: Yeah, I'll probably go skiing that whole weekend.

29
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:32,260
Scott: See what goes on there.

30
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,870
Rym: Yeah, but we're gonna be playing a lot of games.

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,251
Rym: I'm gonna.

32
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:37,560
Rym: I'm gonna actually start streaming some advanced wars.

33
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,204
Rym: I've just been feeling that mm-hmm Might stream some other games.

34
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:42,168
Rym: I've been playing recently.

35
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:45,379
Rym: I will not stream VR chat because good fucking God.

36
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:48,192
Scott: So I got kicked off to it.

37
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:49,019
Rym: What do you got in the news?

38
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,122
Scott: Well, so first of all I just want to briefly cuz you're gonna probably do a full episode on this at some point if I can get Rym to actually Play it.

39
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:58,216
Scott: There's a hot new thing called auto chess.

40
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:04,760
Scott: if you haven't heard of it It is a mod for dota 2 which is totally free because dota 2 is free and the mod is free on the steam workshop.

41
00:02:05,402 --> 00:02:18,360
Scott: And basically it's a game where you draft units from a common pool but you spend money you put the units out in the field and then they fight and Then you draft more units and they fight and if you get three of the same unit they combine.

42
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,400
Scott: So if you get nine of the same unit you get three level two guys.

43
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,744
Scott: They combine to a level three guy.

44
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:24,791
Scott: you get the idea and you get up.

45
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:32,420
Scott: you're up against copies of other people's armies that come To your battlefield every round and there's no reason for the other person to be sitting there, right?

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,292
Scott: You don't have to do any micro because it's auto chess.

47
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:36,055
Scott: They just fight you.

48
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:37,200
Scott: all you do is position them.

49
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:46,220
Scott: You know you draft dudes make armies manage your resources sell dudes put them in the field See how they fight rearrange them by different guys, right?

50
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,919
Scott: And you're all drawing from the same pool of dudes.

51
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,090
Scott: So if Rym buys all the warlocks guess what?

52
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:51,940
Scott: there's a lot less warlocks in the common pool.

53
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:54,994
Scott: My odds of drawing a warlock to buy are less.

54
00:02:55,296 --> 00:03:01,280
Scott: there is some RNG But this game is way fun, but also way jank because it's a dota 2 mod.

55
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,400
Scott: Yeah, so if anyone out there is a game developer make a non jank elegant version of auto chess.

56
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,487
Scott: I can totally help you.

57
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:09,720
Rym: Yep doesn't even have to be that great.

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,089
Rym: Just be the first one to make a polished experience.

59
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:13,233
Rym: if you just take this.

60
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:19,520
Scott: like this core concept is Relatively new and unique even though it combines some existing mechanics like drafting.

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,008
Scott: Yeah If someone makes a polished version of this core concept You will kick ass the same way.

62
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:32,320
Scott: fortnight kicked pub G's ass in terms of polishing a turd Not like, you know polishing something that wasn't as good.

63
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:45,280
Rym: I feel like this will scratch the same itch in some ways because remember all those kind of janky PC games that were like Make an army of liches or whatever in a stacked order and they'll kind of auto fight against other people's armies.

64
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,220
Rym: But they were all like text-based websites like no graphics.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,088
Scott: This would make a great tabletop game.

66
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:52,036
Scott: This is like it's got a lot going for it.

67
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:53,000
Scott: It's really good.

68
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:54,484
Scott: Definitely try it out.

69
00:03:54,504 --> 00:04:02,613
Scott: the bad UI almost had me quit early on as I have done many times But I'm only playing this enough to review it.

70
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:04,562
Rym: I ain't gonna play it long term I don't think.

71
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,720
Scott: I've almost gave it up after like round the first play.

72
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:13,956
Scott: I was ready to bash the developers face in for making such a bad UI But then I got it in round two.

73
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:15,062
Scott: in round two I didn't.

74
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:19,964
Scott: I fucked up way less and was able the fun was able to shine through over the UI.

75
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,456
Scott: that still makes me want to kill somebody.

76
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:23,886
Scott: so There you have it.

77
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:24,349
Scott: You got to check.

78
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:25,719
Scott: the auto chess is the new hotness.

79
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,509
Rym: We didn't say hey, maybe we should.

80
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,677
Rym: we said you should because I ain't got time.

81
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:31,440
Scott: I ain't got time for that.

82
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,402
Scott: Yeah I already got.

83
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:32,643
Scott: I can.

84
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:36,317
Scott: I can consult with you in exchange for a fee and I'll tell you a guarantee.

85
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:39,127
Scott: if you follow my Advice you will make an amazing game.

86
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:40,933
Rym: We already got like 1.25 like games.

87
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:42,157
Rym: We're actually working on it.

88
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:43,200
Scott: All I got time for is advice.

89
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:44,419
Scott: Anyway, so real news.

90
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:55,214
Scott: So we already talked about in a previous ignites episode about the epic stored right other stores trying to compete with steam Right in the whole deal with having too many game stores or not enough game stores and

91
00:04:55,254 --> 00:05:00,317
Rym: all this nonsense like people thinking that Influencers will be the way to get people to buy their game

92
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:00,760
Scott: anyway.

93
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,232
Scott: So what's happening now is for there's.

94
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:09,360
Scott: there's now going to be this game called Metro Exodus Which is there's a FPS called Metro.

95
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:20,454
Scott: It's a FPS series called called Metro that involves like FPSing and sort of a post Apocalyptic Russian ish kind of space with like monsters and shit.

96
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:21,597
Scott: I played one of them once.

97
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:23,111
Scott: I got it for free or something I don't know.

98
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:27,080
Scott: But anyway, the new one is coming out and you can pre-order it on Steam.

99
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:28,847
Scott: But they just announced.

100
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:32,300
Scott: guess what this game is going to be exclusive to the epic store.

101
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,460
Rym: Well for one year, right?

102
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:35,845
Scott: Which means so?

103
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:40,141
Scott: this is because the steam store charges the developers 30%.

104
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:44,490
Scott: So if I sell a game on Steam for 10 bucks Valve takes three bucks and I get seven bucks.

105
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:49,369
Scott: if you sell a game on the epic store The epic store takes what 10 or 15 percent?

106
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,112
Scott: I think 15.

107
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:50,393
Scott: Yeah.

108
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:51,417
Rym: I already forget.

109
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:52,381
Scott: I think it's 15.

110
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:53,767
Rym: So definitely a lot less.

111
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:55,656
Scott: It's a lot less than what steam takes.

112
00:05:56,078 --> 00:05:59,267
Scott: so But here's the thing.

113
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:01,920
Scott: so they announced we're gonna be exclusive on the epic store.

114
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,184
Scott: So all the people pre-ordered on Steam are still gonna get the game on Steam and people are in a rush to pre-order on Steam today.

115
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:10,700
Scott: so they get it on Steam so they don't have to use the epic store.

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,655
Rym: But and physical copies will include steam keys.

117
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:15,459
Scott: That's good to know.

118
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:19,740
Rym: But anyway, I think that's just because they already printed them and it's too late - I think so, too.

119
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,860
Scott: But if you want to get the game starting tomorrow digitally, you have to go to the epic store now.

120
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,382
Scott: Here's the thing.

121
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:31,100
Scott: They're like, it seems like they made this deal right because They'll save a lot of money.

122
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,050
Scott: They'll make more money if they sell it in the epic store.

123
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,678
Scott: taking that epics taking less of a cut.

124
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,178
Scott: but The thing is on the epic store.

125
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:40,874
Scott: Game is $50 and on the steam store.

126
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:42,261
Scott: It's $60.

127
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:47,956
Scott: So per copy the developer is gonna make 50 extra cents per copy if they sell.

128
00:06:47,976 --> 00:06:57,372
Scott: if you buy in the epic store versus the steam store That's I guess that adds up if you have like thousands of sales But it only adds up to like hundreds or thousands of dollars.

129
00:06:57,412 --> 00:06:59,120
Scott: It's not like a shit ton of money, right?

130
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:01,968
Rym: Granted the margins in gaming are not great.

131
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:06,331
Scott: No, it adds up, you know, whatever but I don't know how many sales Those games can expect.

132
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:06,959
Scott: I have no idea.

133
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:13,440
Scott: But it's like hey, well clearly this is a move that favors not the developer so much.

134
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,100
Scott: But the epic store is doing this to try to get people to come over to the epic store.

135
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,815
Rym: The thing is it's also the fact that they're still hedging their bets.

136
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:24,269
Rym: It's a Time limited exclusive which is always like.

137
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:28,980
Rym: I'm really really suspicious of time limited exclusives because it's not an exclusive.

138
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,224
Rym: Anymore, it's just a delay.

139
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:37,520
Rym: Yeah, like honestly, I would probably just wait a year And then buy the game on Steam directly.

140
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:44,580
Scott: Yeah So most people are saying hey wait a year or two and get the complete redux gold game of the year edition for $7.

141
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:51,080
Scott: And then the cut reply to that is on GOG where there's no DRM because this game is gonna have mad DRM, by the way

142
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,102
Rym: Yep,

143
00:07:52,302 --> 00:08:00,520
Scott: I was actually looking at Resident Evil 2 because that just the remake came out and it's supposed to be pretty sweet compared to Playing actual Resident Evil 2 which is tank controls and sucks to play.

144
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,033
Scott: I was eyeing that but it has met it right on Steam.

145
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:05,619
Scott: It says yo this shit has mad DRM.

146
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:09,459
Scott: So what happens is usually after a while they remove the DRM.

147
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:13,017
Scott: So I'm gonna wait for them to remove the DRM and then I'll play Resident Evil 2.

148
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:18,820
Rym: Meanwhile, so Regarding that DRM, you know, we did our panel and we talked about retro games and we talked a lot about Bionic Commando.

149
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:22,490
Rym: So I had this urge to play Bionic Commando Rearmed.

150
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:25,820
Rym: I bought it on a store that hasn't existed for a long time.

151
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,007
Scott: Oh, you didn't buy it on Steam?

152
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:29,320
Rym: I bought it a long time ago like direct.

153
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:33,159
Rym: Oh, no, uh, but I bought it in a place that didn't have DRM.

154
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,452
Rym: So I just had an EXE that's still on my NAS that downloaded.

155
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:36,874
Rym: It worked.

156
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,440
Scott: Yeah, I have that's having me.

157
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:46,000
Scott: I have a Blood Bowl the first Blood Bowl PC game Not the super old one the more right because the Blood Bowl 2 is out now has been out for I think years already.

158
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:50,560
Scott: But I bought that in some weird-ass store that doesn't exist anymore, but I saved the EXE in the key.

159
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:53,378
Scott: So theoretically I believe I could install and play it.

160
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:58,289
Rym: So it's interesting because on one, you know, we've talked about this a lot But this issue is only gonna get bigger.

161
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:03,166
Rym: on one hand as a consumer Not looking at any other considerations.

162
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:06,036
Rym: I only want to go to one place to buy my games.

163
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:11,860
Scott: Yeah, it is very It's inconvenient to have to have multiple accounts and multiple stores, right?

164
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,139
Rym: It's like I get like I hate the oculus store my oculus store Literally my oculus account exists solely for me to launch Steam VR.

165
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:23,300
Scott: It's not even really that I don't mind having more than one store, right?

166
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,994
Scott: It's like going to different places to get the games is fine.

167
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,140
Rym: I only want one launcher.

168
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:32,906
Scott: I want only one user interface that lists all the games, you know It lists all my software to play.

169
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:40,200
Scott: if that I wish people would still use say the start menu Then I wouldn't need to use a separate interface, but everyone's decided to make a separate interface.

170
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,740
Scott: So it's like I have all these games I got for free in the twitch store.

171
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:52,720
Scott: I have a bunch of GOG games But when I sit down in my computer to play games I open steam and all those games and the other interfaces don't get played because I don't think to look there, right?

172
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:56,713
Rym: Well, I open steam and blizzard launcher specifically.

173
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:57,375
Rym: Oh, right.

174
00:09:57,395 --> 00:10:01,261
Scott: I have a blizzard battle net also Watch.

175
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,006
Rym: it's literally just the overwatch launcher.

176
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:07,038
Scott: compared to say on my iPhone or my iPad all the games are just icons.

177
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:07,840
Scott: They're all together.

178
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:08,548
Scott: I don't need to like.

179
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:16,793
Scott: I have a separate, you know If I had to open the steam app to play games on my iPad I would have a steam icon and all those other games wouldn't get looked at.

180
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:18,840
Rym: there are ways to make that work.

181
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:24,800
Scott: All these stores could have made say APIs to their launchers that someone can make a universal game launcher.

182
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,380
Scott: I would totally be willing to make a universal game launch.

183
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,666
Rym: So there are a lot of ways.

184
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:28,807
Rym: like.

185
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:31,660
Rym: you can just have steam launch games that are just from the desktop.

186
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:32,650
Scott: Oh, you could do that.

187
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:33,540
Scott: It's a pain in the ass.

188
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,138
Rym: You can make links that'll launch steam games from the desk.

189
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,046
Scott: There's It sucks.

190
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:43,832
Rym: Well, the thing is all those ways take a minimum amount of effort.

191
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:48,740
Rym: that when I was younger I was willing to do in the same era when I was willing to customize the shit out of my desktop.

192
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:52,015
Scott: But nowadays I guess I could write a script.

193
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:53,080
Scott: maybe that does it right?

194
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:03,020
Scott: I kind of semi automate like finds all your if it makes a folder in your start menu Finds all your steam games make icons for them finds all your games and all your others like GOG or just DRM free.

195
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:11,100
Scott: So it would go to your GOG library get all the games Yeah, and they make a folder full of icons for all your games and then make a separate interface for searching that folder.

196
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:12,060
Scott: That's full of shortcuts.

197
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:12,643
Rym: Here's the thing.

198
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:21,043
Rym: if I'm looking universal game launch if I'm looking for a game to buy Kind of like when I just go to Amazon I just want to go to one place and type the name of the thing I'm looking for.

199
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:23,695
Scott: it would be annoying to have to open like five stores though there.

200
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,940
Scott: cuz someone could just make a website.

201
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,127
Scott: I'm sure there are websites.

202
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:34,551
Scott: this track the prices of games on all the stores I already don't care like and then you just you that would be your place would be that website Here's the and then you would go there and it would.

203
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,320
Rym: there's the non-video game thing.

204
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Rym: So what I want to watch the next episode of a show like some show or some movie.

205
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:46,995
Rym: What I do is I log into Netflix That's the one that's just there and open on the HDPC and I type the name of the thing.

206
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:52,419
Rym: if I if it doesn't show up there Maybe I go to Crunchyroll and type the name of the thing there.

207
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:53,327
Scott: You know what I do.

208
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:57,370
Rym: if it also doesn't show up there I type the name of the thing into Pirate Bay next.

209
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,960
Rym: You know what I do even if I pay for it.

210
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:09,380
Scott: I go I go to google.com and I say where can I stream X and I look at what it says And if it doesn't say one of the things I'm currently subscribed to I go to Pirate Bay.

211
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:13,093
Rym: I'm not even willing to put the effort in to find out where it is first.

212
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:14,960
Rym: I just type it into the streaming services.

213
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:16,067
Rym: I'm already paying for.

214
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:18,020
Scott: that's too much effort because then I go to go three places.

215
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,060
Scott: I start by going to the Google search immediately.

216
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:23,720
Scott: I just skip past step one, but maybe I have to do that for games now also.

217
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:33,926
Scott: But the thing is if I have to do it for games right Streaming services when you pay for the streaming service you get everything on that service for free and you have this Pirate Bay Alternative for games.

218
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:37,460
Scott: the Pirate Bay alternative is not the greatest like it is for say just a file.

219
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,352
Scott: I'm a lot less willing to pirate a game because that's software.

220
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:48,960
Rym: they could jack up my computer, so I only Pirate streaming media even if I'm like already paying for it on a service just because it's convenient.

221
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:51,109
Rym: But with games piracy is not convenient at all.

222
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:51,812
Scott: right exactly.

223
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:57,900
Scott: and the thing is let's say I go to that website And I search where can I buy game X and it's available on five different games.

224
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,256
Scott: It's available on GOG and steam and epic and ea origin or whatever in that case.

225
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:04,740
Rym: I probably buy it on steam.

226
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,165
Scott: It's cheaper on.

227
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:08,212
Scott: you know about getting the epic one.

228
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:10,520
Scott: I don't have an account on the epic store right now.

229
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:20,063
Scott: I'm gonna go out Google make an account on the epic store just to buy one game and then Remember that to play that game have to open the epic store and not see I'm not motivated by price Just like online.

230
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:24,380
Scott: this is why people are paying 10 extra dollars to get metro on steam things.

231
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,125
Scott: You know it's 10 extra dollars.

232
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:31,440
Rym: a lot of things I buy on Amazon cost more on Amazon than they would cost in a local store.

233
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:33,558
Rym: I just don't want to go to a store.

234
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,933
Scott: well You're getting an extra service with that which is exactly what the extra service here is.

235
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:39,639
Rym: it's just in steam yep.

236
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:51,432
Scott: So actually dad I guess though if you were starting today And you didn't already have a steam games going back to literally the day steam launched in 2004 or whatever then you could start with the epic store today.

237
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:52,195
Scott: be fun right.

238
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,540
Rym: so dazzle points out in the chat.

239
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,919
Rym: It's actually a pretty good thing that we can mention here.

240
00:13:56,702 --> 00:14:02,480
Rym: The advantage of having a game launcher is the integrated online features like chat community parties voice chat.

241
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:05,200
Rym: I want to say I don't use any of that in steam.

242
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:07,376
Scott: I don't use any of that, but you know what's really annoying you?

243
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:12,156
Rym: that in Blizzard I don't know game launcher has anything better than just discord.

244
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,060
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

245
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:24,440
Scott: It's super annoying that now when I open up a game There's like a steam overlay and a discord overlay And it's like it's like overlay central right with all these things piled up on top of a game.

246
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:25,919
Rym: It's like if someone messaged me.

247
00:14:27,124 --> 00:14:29,860
Scott: One at least at least the Microsoft one died and went away.

248
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,460
Rym: Yeah, if I get used to be a Microsoft one my reaction is what why are you using steam to talk to me?

249
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,944
Scott: I occasionally get steam messages.

250
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:38,249
Scott: It's weird you get.

251
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:41,440
Scott: I got steam and battle net and discord like all layered on top of each other.

252
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,465
Scott: It's like no murder.

253
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:42,947
Scott: all of these.

254
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,132
Scott: there can be only one.

255
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:56,547
Rym: like when I play overwatch either I use discord just because that's what I happen to have open or sometimes I've literally just like made a direct Google chat call to someone Because people abandon Federation.

256
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,433
Scott: we should have gone full-on with the Federation.

257
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:00,540
Rym: well because no one can make money in Federation.

258
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,383
Scott: That's too damn bad.

259
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:03,752
Scott: You're not making money with your battle net chat.

260
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:04,715
Scott: That doesn't make you money.

261
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:06,020
Scott: selling games makes you the money.

262
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,659
Scott: Why do you even have the chat in there?

263
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:12,725
Rym: So well so speaking of chat I have a brief geek bite.

264
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,316
Rym: all right because I have been poking around in VR check.

265
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:18,820
Rym: cuz I got VR play around with this Alright, so what is it?

266
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,948
Scott: You just put the VR helmet on you walk around.

267
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,936
Scott: what like a cyberspace like second life.

268
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:23,760
Scott: and yes and chat.

269
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:25,366
Scott: Yes, there's no games.

270
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:26,049
Scott: There's no nothing.

271
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:26,249
Scott: well.

272
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:28,699
Scott: There are chatting there are games like what.

273
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:29,040
Rym: so here?

274
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:36,372
Rym: So here's the deal with VR based games like no No like full-on capture-the-flag fucking FPS.

275
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:36,773
Rym: Let's go.

276
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:39,040
Rym: It's just in there really in the world.

277
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,685
Scott: You can just program games in it.

278
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,515
Rym: Yeah, you can prove the deal with VR chat.

279
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:44,820
Scott: That's pretty good is one?

280
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:46,092
Rym: It's not the.

281
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:50,680
Rym: its primary Function is that it is an SDK to make VR shit, okay?

282
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,504
Scott: That is it?

283
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:52,758
Scott: so it's like Gary's mod of VR.

284
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:57,777
Scott: Yeah, but if I'm playing CTF can I just like spawn like a bomb and I blow it up.

285
00:15:57,837 --> 00:16:01,394
Scott: and no Cuz you use the physics engine to send people flying.

286
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:02,400
Rym: it depends on the room.

287
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:07,860
Scott: So you can make a room That has whatever you want in it and then someone's the admin of the room and the other people can't mess with it.

288
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:17,080
Rym: Basically, but people can make a mod like the mod of the IRC channel And people make avatars that do stuff and there's like yeah, my avatar is an enormous wall.

289
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:24,155
Scott: Yep, so I spy I wait until my team moves the flag pattern and then I spawn.

290
00:16:24,336 --> 00:16:28,959
Rym: so if someone's avatar is shitty You can block it from interacting with you and just walk through it.

291
00:16:29,562 --> 00:16:33,659
Scott: Ah, oh, but then I can block walk through the person who's blocking me from capturing the flag.

292
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:38,626
Scott: Oh, yeah, so block the entire enemy team so they can't block me Maybe.

293
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:40,119
Rym: so it depends on how someone made the game.

294
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:44,960
Rym: Anyway the deal with it is that it's also you can make your own avatars just import stuff.

295
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:47,036
Scott: So it's a willing Gibson style cyberspace.

296
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:54,840
Rym: Yes So oculus has it's like social nonsense through Facebook to like hang out in rooms with people steam has it like ever.

297
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:57,540
Rym: Everyone has their hangout in VR space.

298
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,294
Rym: So it's it's it's third life because you already had second and no one uses any of those things because they're hard to use and They suck and they're very gated.

299
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:04,980
Scott: That's good.

300
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:09,980
Rym: The reason VR Chad has exploded so big like it's big a lot of people are in there.

301
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,175
Rym: How many people own VR headsets that are in so you can also enter it without a VR headset?

302
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:16,508
Rym: Oh, that's why okay There's a desktop client just works.

303
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,623
Scott: Oh, that's why everyone's in there and Picking.

304
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:27,138
Rym: and so if you make an avatar give it whatever emojis you want or if you meet someone who has a cool avatar I guess if you're using VR you wouldn't see your own avatar?

305
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:30,199
Rym: No, but you can look down and you see your body there.

306
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:31,524
Scott: Guess you would.

307
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:33,696
Scott: hey, yeah, and you can abuse in the desktop client.

308
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:35,486
Scott: You're doing third-person You're not doing first person.

309
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,760
Rym: Most people seem to do first person, but you can do third person.

310
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,054
Scott: I would do third person with a desktop client first person via.

311
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:46,180
Rym: so in VR The avatar will just move with you, but you can also program things like do a backflip or do a dance.

312
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:49,220
Scott: So you can sort of tell if someone's VR and cuz they're moving differently.

313
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,562
Scott: Yeah if people are VR guess I could like get a VR controller and not use the headset and then get the Right.

314
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:58,351
Scott: get the realistic VR movements without.

315
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,560
Rym: yeah, the problem is you'd need the head movement to make it all really feel.

316
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,697
Scott: I could just get people use nerds for playing military FPS is use those head trackers.

317
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:08,209
Rym: Yeah Sensors to make those work.

318
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:09,720
Scott: Yeah, it's a sensor thing you buy.

319
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:14,156
Rym: If you're going to start an effort just wear the real VR headset at that point a little.

320
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,792
Scott: it's a little weightier than Anyway, so all VR chats.

321
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:26,420
Rym: India like this is the jankiest one But all of them the one thing they do really really really well, but the jankiest one is the most popular one.

322
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:29,380
Rym: Yeah, is that the way the movement works?

323
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,956
Rym: It's really immersive and you really feel like there's a real human being right there in the room with.

324
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:35,020
Scott: it goes in the shell time.

325
00:18:35,103 --> 00:18:35,397
Scott: Let's go.

326
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:41,820
Rym: So the deal with VR chat is that all the other things are like make this space and like invite people to the space.

327
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,165
Rym: It's just fucking anarchy.

328
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,000
Rym: in VR chat you walk into a hub and there's just people on and around.

329
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:47,967
Scott: That's how it's supposed to be.

330
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:49,840
Rym: you can be like wander to a random world.

331
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,487
Scott: That's the cyberpunk vision in a world.

332
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:54,038
Rym: You can drop a portal to another world and be like everybody.

333
00:18:54,058 --> 00:18:54,941
Rym: follow me Is there?

334
00:18:54,962 --> 00:18:56,789
Scott: how do you get a list of worlds slash list?

Scott: There is sort of.

336
00:18:58,657 --> 00:19:01,446
Rym: there's just a list But it's so long you could never like.

337
00:19:01,547 --> 00:19:02,831
Scott: you can search it though.

338
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:04,115
Scott: Barely barely.

339
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,620
Rym: You got to just fucking explore.

340
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:09,900
Rym: So you browse yeah or find a friend or go to a world meet someone cool.

341
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,140

Scott: Can I just can I?

Rym: you can drop a portal and you jump through it.

350
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,059
Scott: Oh, everyone physically walks through the portal in the game.

351
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,683
Scott: Yeah, if they want to I choose a world and I make a portal and now people can walk into it and I'll go to Same place together.

Rym: Same thing with avatars.

356

Rym: if someone has a cool avatar just steal it from them.

359

Rym: so here's what I have in order.

378
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:41,787
Rym: one Unity-chan, which is this cute anime girl because that's because that's the only default avatar that isn't ugly as shit Okay, and also it's cute.

379
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:42,952
Scott: Whatever what else would remake?

380
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:45,763
Scott: my second avatar was Bulbasaur And then Spiritomb.

381
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:46,446
Scott: That's a Rym thing.

382
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:49,257
Rym: Then the Hachiroku full-scale.

383
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:49,980
Scott: Just a Hachiroku.

384
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,682
Scott: Yeah, is it?

385
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:55,275
Scott: is it like on its hind wheels standing up or is it just driving?

386
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,858
Rym: Just a car like flap the headlamps open and close.

387
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,008
Rym: It is it's just anarchy in there.

388
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,757
Scott: All right, so it sounds like my kind of place.

389
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:10,034
Rym: it is worth Poke it around in its race gets totally free.

390
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:11,340
Scott: I'm going to get the desktop when I go.

391
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:12,524
Rym: Yeah, it is.

392
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:15,293
Scott: It's just can't make a GeekNights world GeekNights world.

393
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:16,437
Rym: I think we should.

394
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:17,460
Scott: what's in the GeekNights world?

395
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:18,547
Rym: So here are the.

396
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,420
Rym: before we move on my last bit of the geek bite.

397
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:27,640
Scott: Here are the places I ran into broadcast every night's episode in VR chat and could make a stage with a desk.

398
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:34,884
Scott: I went into a world that was and then it'll be a screen that shows the YouTube stream on it and then they'll be Some people can sit.

399
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:37,834
Scott: I went into a back of the back of this.

400
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:39,560
Scott: seats will be a dig-dug machine.

401
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:43,140
Rym: I went to do a world that was called running in the 90s and it is the song.

402
00:21:45,961 --> 00:22:00,040
Rym: It's that song running in a loop and it's basically like Part of Mount Akina and everyone was just dressed as initial D cars Except a bunch of people who were dressed as Pokemon and they were just arguing about random internet shit hanging out.

403
00:22:00,762 --> 00:22:05,118
Scott: I would I would be dude and I would stand on the side behind the guardrail and pump my fist.

404
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:08,340
Rym: Yeah So then I went to a world that was called karaoke world.

405
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:13,000
Rym: It was just a bunch of people legit singing karaoke and taking turns so you can use microphone action.

406
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:13,985
Rym: It just works.

407
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,572
Scott: But what if you're in a room with a lot of people?

408
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:16,115
Scott: How does that work?

409
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:17,220
Rym: audio proximity?

410
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,069
Scott: The closer you actually have that program.

411
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:19,732
Scott: Yeah, that's good.

412
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:26,060
Rym: It's it's Just what if I yell real loud if you annoy people.

413
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:34,316
Rym: So the one thing that really but the reason I'm talking about VR chat is because This is this is a place that is rife for like 4chan style abuse.

414
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:40,814
Rym: Yeah it Anti harassment features are first and foremost really by default.

415
00:22:41,054 --> 00:22:46,661
Rym: your shield level is to two people You haven't friended meaning their avatars can't do crazy shit Like.

416
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:50,355
Rym: they can't spawn particle effects that you would see they can't be too big.

417
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:56,336
Rym: They can't play audio They can only talk and it is real trivial to block someone.

418
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:59,271
Rym: they just disappear You just don't see him anymore.

419
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,736
Scott: Mm-hmm Was there a Nazi Channel?

420
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,835
Rym: I assume there is in there somewhere, but I did not encounter any Nazis.

421
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:07,920
Scott: It's not just like deleted.

422
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,587
Rym: So here's the trolling I encountered.

423
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:10,088
Scott: Are there any?

424
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,735
Scott: are there any sexy sexy channels?

425
00:23:11,815 --> 00:23:13,000
Rym: Yes, there's a million of them.

426
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,971
Rym: Good fucking God.

427
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:17,186
Scott: All right Which one are we going to be?

428
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:19,032
Rym: as NSFW as you wants?

429
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:21,260
Rym: you can't bring that shit into a public channel.

430
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:25,052
Rym: Uh-huh, you can have the boobiest avatar you want.

431
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:26,818
Scott: But how do I get into the private channel?

432
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:27,380
Rym: find it?

433
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,494
Scott: I need a password or know what you need to know the name private world.

434
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:32,323
Rym: get invited to it by a friend I don't know.

435
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,234
Rym: meet somebody and they password it.

436
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:35,120
Scott: or can I just click on one?

437
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:36,627
Rym: Uh, I guess just click on it.

438
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:37,672
Rym: meet some dude in a shady.

439
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:39,140

Rym: So here's the trend.

443
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:45,452
Scott: I can hand out invites to the porn channel.

444
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:46,496
Rym: I turned shields down.

445
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:47,200
Rym: I went to a room.

446
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:51,240
Rym: I was hanging out and this kid is just like hey everybody follow me and he drops a portal.

447
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,528
Rym: I'm like, all right.

448
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:53,473
Rym: I got my shields down.

449
00:23:53,735 --> 00:23:54,500
Rym: I go into the portal.

450
00:23:55,361 --> 00:24:02,919
Rym: it's just this black world where you're falling to the void forever and then his avatar was like this Thousand-foot Godzilla that starts screaming.

451
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:06,347
Rym: It almost made me sick.

452
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:08,176
Rym: I had to like jump out of the room in a hurry.

453
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:09,000
Scott: Oh cuz you're a VR.

454
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:13,486
Scott: Yeah, I was mean I was falling through Desktop, that would just be hilarious.

455
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:19,140
Rym: Yeah, it was still hilarious because I don't get VR sick, but We'll talk about VR chat in the future.

456
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:23,020
Rym: But it this is where post-millennials are hanging out.

457
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,740
Rym: This is like the place that people are just socializing on the internet only cyberpunk place.

458
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:31,160
Scott: Well, that's great, but I'm still not buying some oculus headset.

459
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:36,400
Rym: No, so it also works with oculus go which is the light headset that doesn't need sensors and doesn't need a computer.

460
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,470
Scott: That is vastly superior, but still too big.

461
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:38,993
Scott: I've seen it.

462
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:40,099
Rym: Yeah, it's pretty good.

463
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:42,467
Rym: So one last gaming news.

464
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:44,996
Rym: really briefly that took longer than I expected.

465
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:49,060
Rym: if you didn't notice There was a sports ball game a football game, right?

466
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,840
Scott: So that basically here's the deal in the NFC championship game Which is a game that they play and the winner goes to the Super Bowl.

467
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,886
Rym: That's a big deal game.

468
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:58,299
Scott: It happened two weeks ago because the Super Bowl is this weekend.

469
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:05,464
Scott: The winner of the game likely won because the ref did not make a call They should have made.

470
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,999
Scott: had the ref made the call the other team probably would have won.

471
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,038
Scott: Therefore the legitimacy of the Super Bowl is in question.

472
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,069
Scott: now It should be a different team in the Super Bowl this weekend.

473
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:20,260
Rym: in a lot of Lee in a lot of other big major sports There are more games and fewer opportunities.

474
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:24,596
Rym: Yes one bad call in one game base literally determine who gets the Stanley Cup baseball.

475
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:27,700
Scott: the National League Championship Series is four out of seven.

476
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:34,663
Scott: So if there's a no call in one of the games and you still lose the series say five one Guess what?

477
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:38,017
Scott: Yeah, you can't really complain but football with it for four.

478
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,829
Rym: I mean for one American football for a variety of reasons.

479
00:25:42,371 --> 00:25:44,960
Rym: one bad call literally could determine it goes to the Super Bowl.

480
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:53,280
Scott: now They do have lots of rules for replay and challenging But they are not extensive enough as that you could run out of challenges or in this case There was a no call.

481
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:53,883
Scott: So it's like.

482
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:55,590
Scott: you're not allowed to like you challenge.

483
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,365
Scott: if like you think the ref like, you know Didn't made a wrong call.

484
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,452
Scott: not if they just didn't call something.

485
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:02,495
Scott: There's nothing to challenge.

486
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:06,760
Rym: Yep, right like in hockey You can't just be like hey that was sparing and you didn't see it.

487
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,893
Rym: They might find the guy after the game, but it's highly unlikely.

488
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:13,440
Rym: They're gonna back up and say, okay There's a two-minute minor from five minutes ago.

489
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:16,637
Scott: There's also a lot of hypocrisy on the part of the NHL.

490
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:24,599
Scott: for example There was a guy who committed a hit to the head right and got a fine after the game But in the game, it was not penalized.

491
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:29,200
Scott: So so they missed that call, but they sought to rectify it after the game.

492
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,939
Scott: But here they miss a call that actually affects the result of the game.

493
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,042
Scott: They don't rectify it.

494
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:36,872
Scott: also to add to the arrogance of the the NFL right.

495
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:40,220
Scott: the commissioner hasn't even made a comment on it.

496
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,233
Scott: He's not going to make a comment until the Super Bowl press conference.

497
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:48,456
Scott: No, he's basically just ignoring it Like I don't have to do to you, you know, please I ignore.

498
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:54,400
Scott: I ignore I feel like he'll get away with it in the right, but the the basically regardless the the consequence is unavoidable.

499
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:59,033
Scott: Is that the integrity and credibility of the league has taken a lot of damage?

500
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:03,603
Rym: So here's the news attorney Frank DiMaggio D'Amico.

501
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:06,253
Scott: that sounds like the name of an attorney like Vinny.

502
00:27:06,474 --> 00:27:12,920
Rym: Vinny someone right so Says he has filed a civil suit in New Orleans on behalf of Saints season ticket holders.

503
00:27:13,502 --> 00:27:16,090
Scott: That's the wrong person to file on suit behalf of yep.

504
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:17,936
Scott: So legally I think he's got nothing.

505
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,465
Scott: so not not a lawyer But I feel like he's got nothing.

506
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:24,000
Rym: So there is a lawsuit that is actually moving.

507
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:27,096
Rym: The lawsuit has now been moved to federal court.

508
00:27:27,237 --> 00:27:30,914
Scott: Yeah, I Think it'll be dismissed or won't win.

509
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,705
Scott: Yeah NFL lawyers.

510
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:39,699
Scott: Yeah, so I don't because going up against NFL lawyers your rich season ticket holders But you're up against NFL on one hand.

511
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,610
Rym: Yeah, the like a bad call was made.

512
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:49,300
Rym: and yeah, because this is a big-money sport There are real-world consequences for players not for fans.

513
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:56,015
Scott: The only consequence that they have gambled yep the industry the city.

514
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:57,358
Scott: well one's gambling is legal.

515
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:04,600
Scott: suddenly then Real that the bookie can sue and they have a case but the team that might not go to this is out.

516
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:08,253
Scott: The gambler has a small case, but the bookie has a big case.

517
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:10,040
Rym: So there's a lot of money involved.

518
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:12,371
Scott: So season ticket holder has a small case.

519
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:17,300
Scott: There's like oh you got denied Super Bowl tickets But you know what denied the right to scalp Super Bowl tickets, right?

520
00:28:17,481 --> 00:28:22,916
Scott: But the if the team sued which they won't but they could then the players could sue.

521
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,287
Scott: they have a bigger case But they're not suing.

522
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:26,234
Scott: They're just complaining.

523
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:35,655
Rym: So I am 100% unsympathetic to the fans like don't especially yeah Because the sports ball game didn't go the way you want it, even though that sucks.

524
00:28:35,796 --> 00:28:38,844
Rym: Yeah, but in Terms of the rest of it.

525
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:40,169
Rym: There are real-world consequences.

526
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:43,140
Rym: So you could almost see where like where a lawsuit like this go ahead.

527
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:46,080
Scott: I don't want sports gambling to be legal actually, but you know what?

528
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,000
Scott: I say make it legal just so I want to see the bookies sue the leagues for fucking up.

529
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,847
Rym: Yeah, but here's the other thing.

530
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:54,172
Rym: It's the NFL.

531
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,377
Rym: They can do whatever the fuck they want.

532
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:56,220
Scott: Yeah legally.

533
00:28:56,342 --> 00:29:05,766
Rym: They probably got a contract League and Commissioner Rym and Commissioner Scott say you know what this team wins because I don't like your hat There's actually people were claimed.

534
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:11,911
Scott: There is a clause actually in the NFL whatever Whatever, you know, I guess it has a charter.

535
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:17,769
Scott: I don't know a lot about the NFL Charter Some kind of document because NFL is a nonprofit right itself.

536
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:20,717
Scott: Just the individual teams are for profit, right?

537
00:29:20,737 --> 00:29:28,109
Scott: But anyway the the oh the Commissioner can actually just Unilaterally change the result of a game.

538
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:31,605
Scott: the Commissioner could have said, you know what Saints win Don't is never.

539
00:29:31,665 --> 00:29:34,120
Scott: I don't think he's ever done it and he didn't do it in this case.

540
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,705
Rym: So I'm also pretty confident.

541
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:42,292
Rym: all the contracts within the NFL probably together have clauses that effectively say The NFL can do whatever the fuck it wants.

542
00:29:42,493 --> 00:29:43,480
Scott: I'm also curious.

543
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:45,005
Scott: Conspiracy time.

544
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:46,229
Scott: the Ellie.

545
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:52,729
Scott: the LA Rams who recently moved to LA from st Louis are the team that beat the Saints because of the no-call.

546
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,553
Scott: was the fix-in?

547
00:29:54,814 --> 00:29:57,200
Scott: because LA is a bigger market than New Orleans.

548
00:29:57,942 --> 00:29:58,464
Rym: You know what?

549
00:29:58,785 --> 00:29:59,547
Rym: I bet there's.

550
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:01,915
Rym: no I bet they could do that if they wanted to.

551
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:02,758
Scott: was the fix-in?

552
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:04,441
Rym: I Doubt it.

553
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:10,075
Scott: if the no-call had been the other way would they have done something to put the Rams in the Super Bowl over the Saints?

554
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:14,658
Rym: I mean, I remember a time where the Red Wings are on the way to get a Stanley Cup and they were sweeping people.

555
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:17,488
Rym: and Then in the Stanley Cup Finals, it was or was?

556
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,033
Rym: it was the semi-finals the finals.

557
00:30:19,314 --> 00:30:22,522
Rym: They won three games in a row Ridiculously.

558
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:25,239
Rym: the fourth game was away and then the fifth game would have been at home.

559
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:34,048
Rym: They lost that away game after winning three ridiculous games in a row just by a little bit And then they crushed in the home game.

560
00:30:34,731 --> 00:30:36,619
Rym: So did they just try to bring the cup home?

561
00:30:37,626 --> 00:30:49,800
Scott: Maybe yeah, I just want to say though There really is that all sports all professional sports are not using replay technology Effectively enough or creatively enough, right?

562
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,120
Rym: I think the enemy the NHL is pushed it way further than other sports, right?

563
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:04,593
Scott: But what I'm saying you could do that no one does is have separate people watching basically every part of a game On video right the whole time.

564
00:31:04,674 --> 00:31:08,107
Scott: not you don't even rest on the ice They're asking the ice can be looking out for the basic stuff, right?

565
00:31:08,187 --> 00:31:11,940
Scott: Yep, and call things just as the game is going on, right?

566
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:16,127
Scott: All rules in real time.

567
00:31:16,147 --> 00:31:19,440
Rym: so it's got have one lot one like linesman version two.

568
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,420
Rym: We'll call him a. screens min one screens min per player.

569
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:25,132
Rym: Yeah, and they just watch each player and be like up he hooks.

570
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:25,734
Rym: Yep.

571
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:27,563
Scott: He got hooked exactly Why not?

572
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:30,440
Scott: and then in real time they could just call right you don't even to stop play.

573
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,039
Scott: You can just be like put that guy in the box.

574
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,925
Scott: You open up the box.

575
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:33,650
Scott: people are still playing.

576
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:37,700
Scott: he skates over to the box gets in Especially for a game like soccer where they don't even stop the clock.

577
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:46,140
Scott: Yeah You can just have guys watching every all 22 soccer players cuz it's 11 on 11 right all the time and call everything perfectly perfectly.

578
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,200
Rym: Yellow cards just start falling.

579
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:56,420
Scott: Just have people watching every second of every game, especially, you know doing that to great lengths for just a regular season game.

580
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,228
Scott: Alright, maybe that's too far.

581
00:31:58,309 --> 00:31:59,273
Scott: Maybe it cost too much.

582
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:00,640
Scott: Maybe it's too resource intensive.

583
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:02,360
Scott: You guys have a couple people doing it.

584
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:10,997
Scott: Just look a little bit more closely, but for the NFC championship game and the Super Bowl and the World Cup Why would you not do this?

585
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:18,320
Rym: Yep I mean, there's a reason why for important hockey games Toronto is reviewing every goal regardless of the situation what I'm saying.

586
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:21,231
Rym: So yeah, this will be funny to follow.

587
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:30,108
Rym: But anyway, it's time for Things of the day.

588
00:32:30,128 --> 00:32:36,399
Rym: I am finally disposed toward randomizers But I haven't watched a lot too deeply until now.

589
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:41,660
Rym: Holy crap this Final Fantasy 4 free enterprise randomizer.

590
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,450
Rym: It was way better than I thought it was gonna be.

591
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:47,957
Rym: I'm gonna play this randomizer.

592
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:49,423
Scott: Holy crap I watched.

593
00:32:49,443 --> 00:32:50,551
Scott: part of that speedrun is pretty good.

594
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:52,101
Rym: This is from AGDQ 2019.

595
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:57,480
Rym: It's a four-way race in Final Fantasy 4 where everything's randomized and they're all playing the same seed.

596
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,468
Rym: It's pretty intense and the commentary is A+.

597
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:04,960
Scott: if you're wondering how the hell do you randomize a JRPG watch this speedrun.

598
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:07,640
Rym: They explain it and like you watch you're like wait a minute.

599
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:13,120
Rym: There haven't been any random encounters and as soon as you think that the commentators like so you might have noticed there's no random encounters.

600
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:15,882
Rym: well They can.

601
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:18,853
Rym: the players can turn on random encounters if and when they choose.

602
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,121
Rym: if they want to level something up I need that It's.

603
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:22,226
Rym: I'm playing this.

604
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,010
Rym: I'm playing this.

605
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,693
Rym: This looks good.

606
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:25,320
Scott: Anyway, should we do a GeekNights race?

607
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:26,308
Rym: The problem is no 40 hours.

608
00:33:26,328 --> 00:33:31,329
Scott: No Anyway, so speaking of football.

609
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,514
Scott: Here's a great thing of the day.

610
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:34,260
Rym: Oh, this is so good ESPN.

611
00:33:34,501 --> 00:33:39,480
Scott: What they did is they went on Twitter and they saw this during college football.

612
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:44,340
Scott: You know where people are not as professional and not as good at playing as professional football.

613
00:33:45,162 --> 00:33:46,206
Scott: When kickers missed.

614
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:49,196
Scott: they would see fans of the team tweeting things like.

615
00:33:49,276 --> 00:34:00,288
Scott: I could have made that you bum The kind of thing that I would say like I you know Right yelling at the team stuff that we in the old days and in the current days We would just yell at the TV.

616
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:03,240
Scott: people were typing their yell at the TV things on Twitter.

617
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:07,100
Rym: I have in fact yelled the words I could have made that shot in hockey.

618
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:13,795
Scott: I only say it on the rare occasion But I know it's like when it's like empty net and he's five feet away and they still miss.

619
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:16,527
Rym: but the thing is I Say that in the privacy of my own home.

620
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:19,443
Rym: I don't say it to the person who missed the shot Definitely not.

621
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:23,460
Scott: But anyway, there are people on Twitter who are tweeting like at college kicker her.

622
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:27,460
Scott: I could have made that you bum that kids got homework, right?

623
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:28,926
Scott: He's got a finish.

624
00:34:28,946 --> 00:34:31,099
Scott: that guy's not going to the NFL probably but anyway.

625
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:37,255
Scott: So they called these Pete the contact of these people and they're ESPN.

626
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,350
Scott: they're like, hey, we're ESPN We're gonna give you money right.

627
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:42,300
Scott: come and fly out to be on a TV show.

628
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,429
Scott: You see you're a football fan of this college team.

629
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,196
Scott: You seem like a real passionate fan.

630
00:34:46,257 --> 00:34:47,040
Rym: It sounds like a trap.

631
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:48,553
Scott: We're gonna make a video thing.

632
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:49,239
Scott: Come on out.

633
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,563
Scott: Well, we can't tell you what it is.

634
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:56,306
Scott: It's a prize, but it's it's a thing related to your extreme fandom of this college Football team right?

635
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:56,949
Scott: It's ESPN.

636
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,797
Scott: You're gonna be on TV or on YouTube or whatever.

637
00:34:58,857 --> 00:34:59,239
Scott: Come on out.

638
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:09,980
Scott: So the people in exchange probably for money came on out and they brought him out onto this indoor Field area and they showed them their tweet like I could have kicked that you bum.

639
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:17,282
Scott: And then they're like, alright, go ahead It was what that kick that they missed in that 31 yard line was a 31 yard kick All right.

640
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:17,704
Scott: Here you go.

641
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:18,951
Scott: Make this 31 yard kick.

642
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,560
Scott: Look there isn't even anyone in the field.

643
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:24,912
Scott: It's gonna be even easier than the actual college kicker had to deal with.

644
00:35:24,932 --> 00:35:28,947
Scott: you're just in this no wind right indoors No one rushing at you.

645
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:32,967
Scott: You got all the time in the world and everyone Failed spectacularly.

646
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:39,212
Rym: they kicked about as well as I would yep The woman being like doing the the the shake with them.

647
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:40,416
Scott: She's like holding in her laughter.

648
00:35:40,577 --> 00:35:41,500
Rym: Her face is great.

649
00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:43,209
Rym: She is she is.

650
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,619
Rym: she is also a plus in this.

651
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,233
Scott: But yeah, maybe you know watching this gives you that sort of like.

652
00:35:48,254 --> 00:35:49,880
Scott: haha you you you jerks.

653
00:35:50,121 --> 00:35:55,220
Scott: But it also gives you that respect for the people who actually kick the football to the field goal.

654
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,386
Scott: Like yeah, it's fucking hard.

655
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,160
Rym: Like yeah a 30-yard field goal is relatively easy.

656
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,393
Scott: It's like it's routine for NFL dudes to kick like 40 50-yard field goals.

657
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:05,460
Scott: They're supposed to make those burning wheel.

658
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,850
Scott: It's like yeah, you can't kick a 10-yard field goal.

659
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,733
Scott: Look at holy shit.

660
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:10,420
Scott: That person's gonna keep it like burning wheel.

661
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:12,626
Rym: It's a it's an OBS three or four.

662
00:36:12,747 --> 00:36:14,151
Rym: They just have a b7.

663
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:17,200
Scott: Yeah, it's like he's like he's like g7 and kicking.

664
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,775
Scott: That's why I think right but the college people don't.

665
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:20,137
Scott: they're like b5.

666
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,603
Rym: And I think g7 was that guy who was missing the front half of his foot and had that special shoe that basically turned his Foot into a hammer.

667
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:32,264
Scott: He wasn't as good as current day control, but in his era because it was different in his era He was unbelievable.

668
00:36:32,304 --> 00:36:35,097
Rym: But you know in the meta moment the book club book is the 2001 space.

669
00:36:36,524 --> 00:36:37,531
Scott: I guess I should read bugs.

670
00:36:37,692 --> 00:36:38,639
Rym: I will read it soon.

671
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:44,907
Scott: Coming up this is approaching like the longest not read Book for the book one.

672
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:48,900
Rym: We've been busy - there's been a lot of quality television that I've been watching.

673
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,565
Scott: It's not too much television.

674
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:55,140
Scott: But finally there is a large gap here between now and PAX East where I don't have many plans.

675
00:36:55,241 --> 00:37:00,609
Rym: I will say there is a TV show on regular fucking TV.

676
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,736
Rym: That is actually good.

677
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:05,538
Scott: Yeah the good place Everyone keeps talking about I don't care.

678
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:15,366
Rym: so the all also the deal all those I got a deal is it's a show that acts like the kind of crap someone to watch on TV and then it actually just teaches Them moral philosophy like for real.

679
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:17,131
Scott: I already know moral philosophy though.

680
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:19,960
Scott: Do you really I mean, I know my moral philosophy?

681
00:37:20,202 --> 00:37:25,814
Rym: Well, but I don't need to know anyone else's It addresses the trolley problem in the correct way.

682
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:26,437
Scott: Uh-huh.

683
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:29,447
Rym: So Anyway, we'll do that book at some point.

684
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:32,220
Rym: We put two videos on YouTube.

685
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,953
Rym: So if you want to see our pre-judging of all the anime, they're out.

686
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,120
Rym: now it is on Scott's YouTube channel.

687
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:40,708
Scott: I was watching a Dororo.

688
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:41,631
Rym: I was too.

689
00:37:41,832 --> 00:37:44,300
Scott: I think there's a newer episode I can maybe watch.

690
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,739
Scott: I don't know when new episodes come out, but I'm sure there's one I haven't seen.

691
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:50,500
Rym: now I think Dororo is good enough to where I'm just gonna watch the whole thing and we can review.

692
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,302
Scott: I read the whole manga and so far it's the same but without the Tezuka silliness I did.

693
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,557
Scott: we will do a Wednesday episode on it soon.

694
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:57,019
Scott: Yes

695
00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:58,405
Rym: We're doing spider-man first

696
00:37:58,646 --> 00:37:58,887
Scott: sure

697
00:37:59,188 --> 00:38:18,720
Rym: and also our most recent packs panel nostalgia vs Game design is on YouTube in its entirety with for the first time We have our full complete new production process in terms of how the slides get put into the panel the camera a versus Camera B the color and the temperature and everything is set.

698
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,956
Rym: This is like how all our panels will look from now on and also it's a pretty good panel.

699
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,599
Rym: people seem to like it.

700
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:30,500
Rym: The first one of the comments on the panel after we put it up was literally please come back to ConnectiCon.

701
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:34,977
Rym: Another one was when will you make the next do ten a chapter?

702
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,540
Rym: Both of those may happen in the nearing future.

703
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,449
Rym: I don't know if Scott will go to ConnectiCon, but I will.

704
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,600
Scott: hopefully depends on the circumstances.

705
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,620
Rym: I'm probably gonna only go for like Saturday and having the thing is ConnectiCon doesn't sell out, right?

706
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,606
Rym: Yeah, you don't have to decide till right before.

707
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:55,949
Scott: so if there's already a hotel just like waiting for me in case yeah I can be like oh, it's raining this weekend.

708
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:57,436
Scott: I don't know can't go biking.

709
00:38:57,456 --> 00:38:58,180
Scott: Let's go to ConnectiCon.

710
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:00,519
Rym: Yeah, cuz if I go I'm gonna roll in like Friday night.

711
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:03,699
Rym: I do like a full day Saturday and then leave like Sunday early afternoon.

712
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:10,401
Scott: I can't even just go for like one day like I can go to like Connecticut and then go there like early Saturday morning And then

713
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:14,277
Rym: it's not a bad idea cuz it's a good excuse to go to Connecticut anyway like yeah, yeah

714
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:15,080
Scott: anyway

715
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:18,210
Rym: Beyond that look for our stuff on the internet.

716
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:27,945
Rym: It's time to talk about not good critters Which we also played but La Cosa Nostra all right a 2014 board game that is Relatively new to us.

717
00:39:28,106 --> 00:39:29,290
Rym: I'd played it a couple times.

718
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,093
Scott: I played it one time.

719
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:31,699
Rym: then we got Scott to play it.

720
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:32,825
Rym: It's pretty good.

721
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:40,510
Scott: Yeah, we got a friend who really likes mafia themed games and I like mafia thing, but I don't really like mafia things right.

722
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,000
Scott: I just I regular like mafia things hiding in the stove.

723
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:55,296
Scott: But yeah, so this game the way the fundamental concept is that you're a mob boss And there are other mob bosses, and you got people in your mob because that's what a mob is.

724
00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:59,419
Scott: you get some drug dealers You got some fences you got some I don't know.

725
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,314
Rym: Oh, no is board game geek down just as I'm trying to do the show.

726
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,182
Scott: you got some hit man You know.

727
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:04,944
Scott: you got all the kinds of.

728
00:40:05,044 --> 00:40:11,303
Scott: no you got all kinds of like the no-do gooders that you would have in your mafia Crime squad.

729
00:40:11,364 --> 00:40:15,939
Scott: right, but you can only have so many bad dudes right working for you.

730
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:18,378
Scott: Everyone else is bad dudes working for them, too.

731
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:27,120
Scott: You can hire more dudes with money sure But you got jobs you need to do to get money and each job requires a set of dudes.

732
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,033
Scott: Yeah, so in order to do this job.

733
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:32,589
Rym: I need a nightclub I need a pimp and I need a shitload of drugs.

734
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:33,050
Scott: right.

735
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,057
Scott: so it's like I only have a nightclub.

736
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:37,968
Scott: hey Rym Can I have your pimp?

737
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,136
Scott: I need his help to do some work.

738
00:40:40,557 --> 00:40:42,827
Scott: Hey Joe Can I borrow your night?

739
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:45,839
Rym: your your drug dealer and my response might be?

740
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:56,996
Rym: Yes, Scott you can use my pimp at some point in the future if you will let me at an undetermined point use your loan Shark yep, but my response might also be you know what fuck you in fact?

741
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:58,041
Rym: give me $4,000.

742
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,400
Rym: I'm gonna kill all the other pimps on the table.

743
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:06,480
Scott: Use my nightclub, but I understand that you were using my nightclub for a very lucrative party.

744
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,960
Scott: You will have to give me half the revenues of the party that occurs in my nightclub.

745
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:15,364
Rym: How about how about I'll just give you six grand cash Right now?

746
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:20,102
Scott: that tells me that the party you are going to do in my nightclub is going to make you more than $12,000.

747
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,790
Scott: so now I want even more.

748
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:25,519
Rym: yep, so we say we make our deal, and we're like our deals.

749
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:27,854
Rym: fine We're both gonna make a lot of money, then it's our friends.

750
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:28,680
Rym: You're Joe Joe's turn.

751
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,945
Rym: He's like Rym and Scott.

752
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:33,280
Rym: you both have to give me five grand or I'm fucking killing Scott's pimp right now.

753
00:41:33,582 --> 00:41:37,396
Scott: Yeah, you can kill people yep and then the job won't happen.

754
00:41:37,457 --> 00:41:42,700
Rym: and The game is pretty like we're not gonna go through the rules because the game is actually pretty complex.

755
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,490
Rym: There's a lot of phases, but it's not complex to play.

756
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:51,168
Rym: the complexity just makes the game work because Everything happens.

757
00:41:51,188 --> 00:41:59,959
Rym: you just keep going clockwise Sequentially and first you're taking your mobsters and some of them are smart and some of them are kind of shitty Yeah, and they make money for you.

758
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:03,795
Rym: Yeah So you got some mobsters and every turn it comes to your turn all your.

759
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:15,279
Rym: every round it comes to your turn and all you Is you put a mobster down and you say Smiley two-face is doing this job, and you put the mobster face up and the job face down mm-hmm.

760
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:16,620
Rym: And then it goes around again.

761
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,790
Rym: You say Tommy two toes is doing this other job.

762
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:22,940
Scott: you put the job face down and some of them are better than others.

763
00:42:23,662 --> 00:42:26,810
Rym: Yeah, so one job might be like wreck somebody.

764
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:32,048
Scott: so the job of the like five gun strength super mobster Right the guy in the white suit.

765
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:33,919
Scott: He's doing the most important job.

766
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:39,380
Scott: Yeah, but the job that the one gun guy is doing is probably like some lame-o job.

767
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:47,099
Rym: Some of the jobs are public like I might put Joey Jojo Shabbat ooh down is one gun mobster and be like he's just buying that nightclub.

768
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:50,613
Scott: legit He's buying this for I sent him out to go buy a nightclub.

769
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:51,295
Scott: That's all he's doing.

770
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:51,777
Scott: He's Johnny.

771
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,389
Rym: Johnny Can't fuck this one up.

772
00:42:53,591 --> 00:42:54,519
Scott: He's going to buy.

773
00:42:57,722 --> 00:42:58,549
Rym: He's buying a pimp.

774
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,517
Rym: like there's a new pimp in town.

775
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,527
Rym: We're gonna buy him.

776
00:43:00,587 --> 00:43:01,920
Rym: get him get him into first.

777
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,166
Scott: But he's gonna buy a caravan from some.

778
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:12,419
Rym: but the jobs might be things like this job will pay out 20 grand But you need a nightclub and a senator and a shitload of cocaine.

779
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:15,089
Scott: Yeah, you need like the jobs that pay out a lot.

780
00:43:15,129 --> 00:43:16,254
Scott: the requirements are big.

781
00:43:16,575 --> 00:43:26,172
Scott: so the way to win this game is To get lots and lots of people to agree to do things with you right like if I make a deal with Rym and I Make a deal with every other play like one deal with each other player.

782
00:43:26,574 --> 00:43:29,386
Scott: I'm now doing four deals I'm making bank right.

783
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:38,300
Scott: you want to get as many things to execute as possible and You got to look at who's winning and you you can just direct screwing right in terms of murdering people.

784
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:40,340
Scott: So you look at who's winning and you target their shit.

785
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:46,065
Scott: so it doesn't happen and make sure that you're the person who successfully executes the most deals, but Everything is.

786
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,115
Scott: all that matters at the end of the game is how much money you got.

787
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:49,140
Rym: all you want at the end is money.

788
00:43:49,381 --> 00:43:50,605
Rym: Everything is transaction.

789
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:51,828
Scott: just mobster wins.

790
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:55,560
Rym: well you do get some bonuses for if you still have all your mob.

791
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:56,744
Scott: Turn into money though.

792
00:43:56,764 --> 00:44:02,044
Rym: I yeah everything turns into money and for mobsters you have killed yep So you got.

793
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:11,580
Rym: there's a little bit of an extra incentive to kill some people toward the end Because I sensibly if you have more mobsters alive, and you've killed other mobsters It makes your mob in like a better position.

794
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:18,652
Scott: It's also a side effect like if you've done if you're if you're in the position where you've killed more and have your guys killed Less you've probably completed more jobs.

795
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:19,719
Scott: Oh, yes done more stuff.

796
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:25,440
Rym: So like some jobs are like whack like literally just kill some right some other mobster.

797
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:29,940
Rym: Some of them are like bust somebody up like bust up someone else's pimp.

798
00:44:30,161 --> 00:44:32,570
Scott: Yeah, so they're like they're out of commission, but then they come back.

799
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,300
Rym: Yeah, this is oh, here's a specific job senators party.

800
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,325
Rym: This is what I was thinking of.

801
00:44:36,746 --> 00:44:39,237
Rym: it'll pay out if you get two successes 24 grand.

802
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,220
Scott: Yeah There's a little bit of randomness going on if you get one sick.

803
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:47,960
Rym: But you can mitigate that randomness by putting the better mobsters on something or like putting a henchman down and you roll more dice.

804
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:58,208
Rym: Yeah, if it's only one success 18 grand, but you need a politician a nightclub a pimp and a drug dealer All the things you need for the senator's party.

805
00:44:58,449 --> 00:44:59,473
Rym: It's very thematic.

806
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:01,240
Rym: Like the theme of this game is a plus.

807
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:06,960
Rym: Yeah, so you go around putting all your guys on the jobs and then you go around again executing the jobs.

808
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:12,379
Rym: So I might I might have a job that when I trigger it thought I need a nightclub and a pimp.

809
00:45:13,362 --> 00:45:16,914
Rym: What if I trick don't trigger that job right away on Scott's turn?

810
00:45:17,235 --> 00:45:18,299
Rym: He just murders the pimp.

811
00:45:19,726 --> 00:45:22,220
Rym: Now my job is gonna fail if I trigger the mobster.

812
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,200
Rym: Now I'm gonna make a deal to get another pimp in a hurry.

813
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:31,460
Scott: So if you're gonna do the senator's party, which is worth a lot of money You're gonna want to do that when you're gonna go first so you can do it before anyone kills the senator.

814
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:39,732
Rym: So a lot of games that have this like a scenario confluence Let's say where you can just make binding deals with everybody all the time forever.

815
00:45:40,253 --> 00:45:42,640
Rym: They tend to bog down in the deal-making phase.

816
00:45:42,842 --> 00:45:50,980
Rym: Yeah, this game avoids that because every player takes a short simple action and you just keep going around and going around and going around and going around.

817
00:45:50,980 --> 00:46:00,351
Scott: That's a nice modern design there, you know, wait, no waiting constant doing game doesn't feel long, but it also means that Negotiations will happen when they're relevant.

818
00:46:00,732 --> 00:46:01,977
Rym: I might make a deal in advance.

819
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:02,740
Rym: I might make deals.

820
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:06,875
Scott: You're usually only making a deal relevant to if it's relevant to the one simple action.

821
00:46:06,895 --> 00:46:07,578
Scott: You're about to take.

822
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:13,416
Scott: Yep, or Have a deal in my hand and during the before it's time to put out the deals.

823
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:14,380
Scott: That's what I'm like.

824
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,187
Scott: Well, I want to make this deal happen this turn.

825
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:17,874
Scott: I'm missing these two things.

826
00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:19,540
Scott: Let's see who has those two things.

827
00:46:19,842 --> 00:46:21,577
Scott: I'm gonna try to deal with those two things.

828
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:21,879
Scott: Yep

829
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:41,136
Rym: so the player whose turn it is to do their action is likely to be making the more urgent deals and capturing the attention whoever they need but simultaneously if Joey Jojo is taking a long time on his turn because it's a complicated turn or he's negotiating a big deal Me and Scott on the side might just talking about start talking about like hey Let's trade pimp for pimp for the future like things like that.

830
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:44,812
Rym: Mm-hmm The mechanic of the deals is really elegant to the.

831
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:50,754
Rym: if you want to use someone's thing You get the right to put a deal marker on that thing.

832
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:51,396
Rym: Mm-hmm.

833
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:54,625
Rym: The other player Can't renege on that deal.

834
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:59,040
Rym: Nope, nor like I can use that pimp for whatever I want, right?

835
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,580
Scott: It's like Rym says okay, you can put your marker on my pimp.

836
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:02,840
Scott: I put the marker on his pimp now.

837
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,799
Scott: That means I can use it once and remove the token.

838
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:10,640
Scott: But now everyone else when they're like killing they look around the board and they see like a pimp with like three tokens on it.

839
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,575
Scott: They're like, I guess I'm killing that pimp.

840
00:47:12,716 --> 00:47:18,697
Scott: Yep That's gonna kill like mess up three other people's plans, yep, so it's it's.

841
00:47:18,737 --> 00:47:25,123
Scott: on this one hand It's like a good mechanic, but it's also a great indicator and really mess with people's heuristics You don't want to like.

842
00:47:25,324 --> 00:47:30,565
Scott: do I really want to ask him if I can borrow his pimp if it already has a marker from Someone else on it.

843
00:47:30,665 --> 00:47:31,309
Scott: Oh, right.

844
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:32,576
Scott: That's gonna get that pimp killed.

845
00:47:32,597 --> 00:47:33,140
Scott: There's no point.

846
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:35,124
Scott: Do something else?

847
00:47:35,365 --> 00:47:36,108
Rym: No, no, I want to use.

848
00:47:36,129 --> 00:47:38,740
Scott: maybe I'll buy my own pimp from the middle even though it cost me money.

849
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,537
Rym: No, no, I want to use your other pimp Scott not the one you're loading up that other pimp.

850
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:44,024
Rym: That's right Give me your good pimp.

851
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:44,487
Scott: That's right.

852
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:47,200
Scott: And then when I go around then I say oh which pimp do I want to kill?

853
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,809
Scott: Well Rym's losing the game.

854
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:50,260
Scott: I don't really need to kill any of his stuff.

855
00:47:50,383 --> 00:47:50,979
Scott: Oh, but what's that?

856
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:56,280
Scott: I see Joey Jojo's got a marker on Rym's pimp and Jojo does win in the game.

857
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,738
Scott: I can hurt Joey Jojo and Rym by attacking that dude.

858
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:20,355
Rym: Yep so despite being highly political the politics is deeply constrained by the Realities of the game and the deal-making ends up being the right level of complexity like the kinds of deals I've seen having played this game a few times are things like here's God if you let me use your pimp I'll cut you in 50% on the deal that that pimp facilitates.

859
00:48:20,415 --> 00:48:26,660
Scott: That's perfectly fine deal Especially if you make such deals frequently with a lot of players and most of them execute.

860
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:31,560
Scott: You will end up on the plus side because everyone else will have executed one deal and you'll have executed three or four.

861
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:34,454
Rym: Yep, or I might make a deal like listen Scott.

862
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:44,760
Rym: Let me use your pimp I'll give you five grand in cash right now because if you have a deal that pays out Until you trigger the deal as one of your actions, you don't have that money.

863
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,375
Rym: So getting cash up front might be very valuable to be able to afford the business.

864
00:48:50,435 --> 00:48:55,134
Scott: I forget if you can kill your own dudes Yeah, you can bash your own dude, I think right.

865
00:48:55,154 --> 00:48:55,879
Scott: so maybe not?

866
00:48:56,462 --> 00:48:57,045
Scott: I don't remember.

867
00:48:57,105 --> 00:48:57,486
Scott: if you could.

868
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:58,109
Scott: I don't think I did.

869
00:48:58,149 --> 00:48:58,611
Scott: no one did.

870
00:48:58,631 --> 00:48:59,696
Rym: I don't think I would.

871
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:05,339
Scott: I think I might have asked But it's like I could make a deal or like alright, you can use my pimp Give me some money and then I shoot my pimp.

872
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:11,260
Rym: Yeah, but that generally like the other thing I've seen happen is the because this thing is just keeping the pimp.

873
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,498
Scott: He does spit out money all the time and because it's a real transactional negotiating game.

874
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:22,900
Rym: I've found reliably that players who act in good faith tend to get ignored by the other players or just attacked outright.

875
00:49:24,033 --> 00:49:32,448
Rym: and Revenge is a powerful mechanic in the context of this game in a way that I haven't seen play out in other games that have Similar themes and mechanics.

876
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:51,160
Rym: Yeah, this game is just a very Well-crafted Perfect storm of the right mechanics the right turn length the right level of interaction To give you all that fun feeling of a kind of serious and realistic mafia game Without getting too bogged down in details and without being just advanced werewolf.

877
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:54,854
Scott: Yeah, the thing about the other thing about this game is that it's just cards.

878
00:49:55,456 --> 00:49:57,425
Scott: Yeah, it's just all cards So it's real cash.

879
00:49:57,606 --> 00:49:58,168
Scott: It's all.

880
00:49:58,189 --> 00:49:59,716
Scott: the cash is a little is papers.

881
00:49:59,776 --> 00:50:00,520
Scott: It was not the greatest.

882
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:01,566
Scott: I think I might replace it.

883
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:02,492
Scott: wasn't see.

884
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:03,658
Scott: usually when I see paper money.

885
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:03,900
Scott: I'm like.

886
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:10,320
Scott: But actually I thought that when I saw the game set up on the table But actually when I was playing it was never a problem.

887
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,127
Rym: Oh, it feels good.

888
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:12,558
Rym: when you like I asked someone to go.

889
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:18,066
Scott: I think I would still replace it with chips just because you know Right, but I don't know.

890
00:50:18,146 --> 00:50:20,537
Scott: I feel it didn't upset me like bad paper cash.

891
00:50:20,557 --> 00:50:21,040
Scott: in other games.

892
00:50:23,066 --> 00:50:27,380
Rym: Something felt good about getting a fat stack of cash and then doing the one for you one for me.

893
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,407
Rym: Yeah, I want to do for me one.

894
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:31,213
Scott: It's two for you one two for me.

895
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:39,220
Scott: But anyway, but the If you made chips or replace the money you could really pack this game small.

896
00:50:39,521 --> 00:50:42,690
Rym: Yeah, sighs the games already really small.

897
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:46,040
Scott: I'm saying size per game really good ratio.

898
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:48,650
Rym: It also ain't that expensive like I forget.

899
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:55,396
