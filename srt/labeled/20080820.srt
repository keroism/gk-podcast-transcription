1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,307
Rym: It's Wednesday August 20th.

2
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:11,949
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,034
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:25,882
Rym: tonight after our week at the beach We return to bring you our somewhat haphazard coverage of Otakon 2008.

5
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:26,918
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,839
Rym: Well here it is the moment the night.

7
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,284
Rym: You've all been waiting for.

8
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:40,207
Rym: it's finally the Otakon coverage that I'm sure a lot of new listeners have been asking about waiting for looking for.

9
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:46,130
Scott: yeah We really kind of stink at this Otakon coverage because first of all it always comes way after Otakon.

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:56,343
Scott: It's already been like a week and a half since I ended a week and a half right and We don't cover any of the news or anything that actually happened there.

11
00:00:56,443 --> 00:00:58,730
Rym: so much because it is the rationale for that.

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,794
Rym: I mean we go to all these conventions And we could do that.

13
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:09,326
Rym: the report of and such and such company licensed such and such and then so and so said that they were going to license such and such.

14
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:12,945
Rym: but You get that on the anime news network, and what are we gonna say?

15
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:14,070
Rym: well that show was good?

16
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:20,098
Rym: And that show was bad, and I don't know why they license that show, but you get that from us anyway, so Yeah, I don't know.

17
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:23,155
Scott: It's it's more of a Review of.

18
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:25,470
Scott: you know what it was like at Otakon.

19
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,739
Rym: Well that is that is convention coverage to me.

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,992
Scott: when someone says they're coming as we've done that show We've done me what it was like an Otakon show two or three times already yeah, and every year It's different.

21
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:36,578
Rym: I guess I think so.

22
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,285
Scott: It's a little bit different plus.

23
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:39,390
Rym: We have a lot of new people.

24
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,110
Rym: I mean we have more new listeners than we had listeners from previous Otakons.

25
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:43,867
Scott: I hope so.

26
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:49,529
Scott: Anyway, so before we do that should we do some non Otakon news and such?

27
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:50,557
Rym: well We should at least you know.

28
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:51,343
Rym: blah blah blah.

29
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:52,673
Rym: This is GeekNights I'm sure you.

30
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,300
Rym: I'm glad you finally found our website.

31
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,983
Rym: you listen to us.

32
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:56,209
Rym: you saw our panels whatever.

33
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:02,690
Rym: if You really want those lists of anime you should see or the creators or all that we're gonna put together something.

34
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:09,201
Scott: Yeah, we promised like some stuff to people who came to our panels like we did an anime You should see panel, and it was like.

35
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:15,270
Scott: yeah, we'll put a list of anime You should see on a website somewhere cuz we know you haven't been writing it down and well We'll get around to it.

36
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,565
Rym: I think I've got about half of it done because I'm making a good slideshow to use that.

37
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:26,992
Scott: future cons where we've been asked to Do this actually just upgraded our the WordPress you know so that it would work with the iPhone app You know.

38
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:32,738
Scott: so we'll be able to do a little bit more until I eventually redo the site completely when we'll be able to do anything we want.

39
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:38,650
Scott: and In addition anyone who is not in the forums you should join them.

40
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,670
Scott: I mean if you're listening to this right now that means you're a listener of GeekNights.

41
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:43,920
Scott: Why aren't you in the forum?

42
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,550
Rym: talking might just be people who are like?

43
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,590
Rym: Oh Otakon coverage and all the other Otakon coverage is gone, and I'm bored, and I'm looking forward to the next Otakon.

44
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,132
Rym: Oh my gosh.

45
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:55,650
Scott: Well if that's the case you're awesome because you have found the best Otakon coverage in the universe.

46
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:04,710
Scott: And now that you found it and you realize that you have stumbled into this world of the most amazing podcast Why would you not want to join the forum of this amazing show?

47
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,033
Rym: Anyway, so yes well I mean just so.

48
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:14,109
Rym: you know the way the show works the way we do this every night for the last six hundred or so Episodes is we talk about the news a little bit.

49
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:20,889
Rym: We have a little bit called things of the day Which if you can't figure out what what that is then you might have some problems with the rest of our show.

50
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,587
Rym: And then we talk about what we're talking about.

51
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:28,590
Rym: and tonight We're talking about Otakon, but before that I want to talk a little bit about the New York Anime Festival.

52
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,013
Scott: When is that?

53
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,363
Rym: that is actually at the end of September.

54
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:37,638
Rym: in fact it is specifically September 26th 27th and 28th.

55
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:39,406
Rym: and Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

56
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:42,515
Rym: ah We got plenty of time.

57
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:43,439
Rym: It's still.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,403
Scott: it's too close.

59
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:46,170
Rym: It's several weeks after Pax.

60
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:48,599
Rym: I think we'll live plus live.

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,985
Rym: MC Chris is going to be there.

62
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:51,310
Scott: Oh that helps me out of it.

63
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,529
Rym: Yeah, you never actually saw him in concert.

64
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,643
Rym: I'm curious if he's the man the same set that he's done before.

65
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:58,850
Rym: if he's going to do something new he could do any set.

66
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,102
Scott: He could just get up there and give me the finger and walk off and obviously that.

67
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:05,680
Rym: but anyway for one The New York anime festival.

68
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,304
Rym: we're going to be there.

69
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:07,290
Rym: We're doing a ton of panels.

70
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,704
Rym: We're actually we are doing the final.

71
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:10,428
Rym: This is it.

72
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,315
Rym: It is never going to be run again.

73
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:15,164
Rym: Gekiga panel there Saturday night first off.

74
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:17,130
Scott: Yeah, we're only going to be there Saturday.

75
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:19,709
Scott: We're not going to go Sunday or Friday.

76
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:34,590
Rym: So if you for whatever reason have heard of the infamy of the Gekiga panel that we've run at other Conventions like Otakon or Katsucon this is your last chance to see it And I don't want to run it again because I don't want to get any more hate mail.

77
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:37,328
Scott: Yeah, we're pretty much we're going to start with.

78
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:42,130
Scott: you know We basically I think we decided we're going to come with new panels every year and then retire them.

79
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:51,110
Scott: So if you go to any of the conventions we go to odds are you can you'll get a chance to see most of the panels For the year, you know depending on what that convention wants.

80
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:55,704
Scott: But we're not going to run any you know Say the same panel at the same convention.

81
00:04:55,745 --> 00:05:06,004
Scott: two times now We did actually is the one time where the rule is sort of being broken because I thought the Gekiga panel was retired But the New York Indian festival really wanted us to run it.

82
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:07,870
Scott: It was really even though we ran it last year.

83
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,895
Rym: But here's the thing you know.

84
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:13,586
Rym: we the Gekiga panel has like all these different levels I mean we every con we're like.

85
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:20,209
Rym: alright We can run this anywhere from PG-13 to beyond the beyond quintuple X and boom.

86
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:26,219
Rym: We ran it as the kind of PG-13.

87
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,533
Rym: you know this is purely educational and not so much hilarious And not so.

88
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:35,134
Rym: it was like a Friday morning panel to wasn't at the New York anime festival and you know that's what they wanted.

89
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:43,517
Rym: and apparently they heard tell of the the epicness that was this panel at Otakon and Katsucon and they asked us all right.

90
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:50,939
Rym: Can you run the Otakon one here, and I said no We're willing however to run the Katsucon one there.

91
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,770
Rym: yep, I don't want to fly Gerald out to show us that thing again.

92
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,421
Scott: No, I don't want to see that thing again.

93
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,233
Rym: That was one of the worst things I ever seen.

94
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:00,870
Scott: it was also funny, but also the worst thing I ever seen.

95
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:07,759
Scott: I think that was the most offensive and it's like take this stinkiest poop in the world But then put a smiley face sticker on it.

96
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:11,033
Scott: It doesn't reduce the stinkiest Wasn't poop.

97
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:11,997
Rym: it was an eyeball.

98
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:13,101
Rym: That's all right.

99
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:14,005
Rym: and a tree.

100
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:15,150
Rym: the tree was pretty good though.

101
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,276
Scott: Yeah, we're gonna do the tree.

102
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,670
Rym: we are gonna do the tree all right anyway.

103
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:31,950
Rym: But there's other news about the New York anime festival And this is the main reason I'm bringing this up because there's plenty of time before the con to actually talk about the con But Hideyuki Kikuchi is the creator of Vampire Hunter D. You may have heard of him.

104
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,375
Scott: I thought you should talk.

105
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,960
Scott: Amano was the creator of Vampire Hunter D.

106
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:37,509
Rym: No actually this guy wrote the novel.

107
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:42,515
Rym: ah Okay, he created Vampire Hunter D. Amano just gave him.

108
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,990
Scott: so is his idea to put the eyeballs in the hand or the mouth in the hand?

109
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,690
Rym: I have never actually read them on the novel, so I don't know exactly.

110
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,458
Scott: I know it's for sale in English.

111
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:53,182
Scott: Maybe you should buy it.

112
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:54,890
Rym: I should I just I haven't read it.

113
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,873
Rym: I don't know why.

114
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:59,165
Rym: all right, but he's done a bunch of other stuff.

115
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:00,630
Rym: I mean he's done a lot of work.

116
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:08,508
Rym: I don't want to get into all these things like you did the original manga for like Wind of Amnesia Which oh I want to read that was a really good anime that suddenly turned pornographic.

117
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:10,055
Rym: did it Remember that?

118
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:12,490
Rym: you realize that they showed it on sci-fi?

119
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,250
Rym: I was like all right, but I rented it later to show my parents.

120
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,223
Scott: Wasn't that the one that was all sort of pastel and kind of wiggly?

121
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:20,126
Rym: it was the one.

122
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,450
Rym: where are I humanity?

123
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:29,290
Rym: Aliens come down take away all of mankind's memory and the deal is They're trying to test to see if mankind at its core is good or bad.

124
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,179
Rym: And if they're good great memories back.

125
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,827
Rym: if they're bad destroy the planet.

126
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:33,270
Rym: move on.

127
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,174
Scott: well That's not the one that's.

128
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,609
Rym: I'm thinking of a different show that involved win, but then at the end they all have sex.

129
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,551
Rym: Okay, yes, so I didn't see this coming and I'm my mom's watching it with me, and she's like all right I can.

130
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:45,720
Rym: these these cartoons aren't as weird as I thought.

131
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:46,844
Rym: that's a nipple.

132
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:48,310
Rym: He's low.

133
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:49,949
Rym: This is why you watch these.

134
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:54,809
Scott: She didn't believe you for shit.

135
00:07:56,181 --> 00:08:11,750
Rym: but He wrote a bunch of little stories and a bunch of other things, but one thing in particular that he wrote has never been published Anywhere in English or Japanese in English or Japanese in America or Japan not even in moon language.

136
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:18,490
Rym: He was doing this conference in Japan, and he wrote a short story entitled entitled the wanderers ship for end.

137
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,400
Rym: He gave the publishing rights to one of his fans.

138
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,005
Rym: Just because he's a really nice guy.

139
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:25,630
Scott: wow that's sort of crazy.

140
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:27,459
Rym: So one thing led to another man.

141
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:34,350
Scott: if I was if I was a crazy writer or something I would like write little tiny things create tiny works and just give them out to fans.

142
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:35,376
Scott: You have the rights to this.

143
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:36,140
Scott: you have the rights to this.

144
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,789
Scott: you know that'd be crazy awesome.

145
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:51,625
Rym: so yasue hitomi who had the rights took it and Gave it gave the the New York anime festival the right to publish it for the first time ever in The con book at the New York anime in the con book.

146
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:56,038
Scott: oh, man No one's gonna be throwing that shit away.

147
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:57,745
Rym: I'm really excited about that's.

148
00:08:57,825 --> 00:08:58,769
Scott: that's pretty good.

149
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:06,038
Rym: The thing is this is the kind of thing a lot you people who read the Anime news network might have seen that headline and gone.

150
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:09,330
Rym: ah no the story is much more interesting than you might have thought.

151
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,530
Scott: Wow, that's pretty good.

152
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,495
Scott: I'm suddenly like I read that headline, and I was like a man, but now you tell me the story And I'm like oh shits.

153
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:16,038
Rym: Yes.

154
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:16,721
Rym: He will act.

155
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:18,450
Rym: I mean he will be at the convention.

156
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:19,574
Scott: I might take two of those.

157
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:22,264
Rym: him and Yoshitaka Amano are going to be together.

158
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:23,448
Rym: add to the convention.

159
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,617
Rym: in fact He's having a birthday party there.

160
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:26,240
Scott: Well.

161
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,847
Scott: It's the writers birthday party.

162
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,861
Scott: yes, man I should get him to write a story.

163
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:33,078
Scott: give me the publishing rights And then get a monitor to illustrate it.

164
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:36,329
Scott: then get the publishing rights to that and then I won't have to work anymore.

165
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:39,741
Rym: now Obviously it is going to be published in Japan after the fact.

166
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:42,210
Scott: I'm sure I'm sure Japanese wouldn't stand for that.

167
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:46,736
Rym: I think this is really cool because that is way cool Especially since vampire hunter D in particular.

168
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:48,462
Rym: that was the first anime I ever saw.

169
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:50,488
Rym: that that got me into anime.

170
00:09:50,709 --> 00:10:01,509
Rym: the reason I'm here talking about anime the reason I go to these conventions all of it Because of a vampire where the mouth in his hand that mouth in the hand was the snarkiest coolest hippest mouth in a hand ever.

171
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:03,782
Scott: It's one of the only mouths at hand ever.

172
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:05,872
Rym: There's been a couple more man we should make.

173
00:10:05,913 --> 00:10:15,270
Scott: I just thought what if you had mouth in a hand, but also eyeball from Gitaro and Thing from Adams family and all the sort of body part creatures together.

174
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,437
Scott: That's called a person and it does know.

175
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:26,290
Rym: but like you have all those characters together and like a doujinshi You know, it could be like that gonna guide Chibi Kara world except not stupid exactly.

176
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:28,524
Scott: Anyway, is that all you got to say?

177
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:29,450
Rym: That's all I got to say.

178
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:30,270
Rym: So, all right.

179
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:37,604
Scott: well as people may or may not know all the anime news that we can get because we speak English it comes to man in the news network calm and

180
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:38,892
Rym: Anime news

181
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:46,115
Scott: network calm has this habit of whenever the USA today book list comes out if there are any mangas on it They tell you about it.

182
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:53,509
Scott: So for many many weeks, they'd be like, you know Naruto volume 29 is number six on graphic novels.

183
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:53,569
Scott: it.

184
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,930
Scott: Well first it was like, you know, it's number ten on the book list.

185
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:02,808
Scott: Then it was number three on the graphic novels book list, you know.

186
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:08,684
Scott: and now All mod is no manga on the USA today book list.

187
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:10,730
Scott: Not even the graphic novels book list anymore.

188
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:23,135
Scott: So now they've resorted to saying hey, you know what Naruto volume 30 Is number three on the you know direct market Best-selling graphic novel.

189
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:27,489
Scott: All right, so that means in comic book stores Naruto volume 30 is number three.

190
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:43,941
Scott: So if you judge that really that doesn't tell you anything about the manga market as a whole But it tells you that the big hitting manga their sales are decreasing relative to the sales of other Graphic novels and other books in regular bookstores.

191
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:54,920
Rym: now, this is why I feel like the time is ripe To take the weird stuff from Japan the golf monger from going it, you know All those sorts of things and bring them out in America.

192
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:55,763
Scott: I know I got.

193
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:56,104
Scott: I got.

194
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:58,410
Scott: two other sort of combined news is here.

195
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,929
Scott: I don't think they tie in that much but here we go ready.

196
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:09,646
Scott: So it's a gumi Oba and Takeshi Obata the creative team of Death Note, you know One of whom is an anonymous person who has only done Death Note.

197
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:14,524
Scott: It's totally L I know and the other person is the person who created the art for her car.

198
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,693
Scott: no go and some other awesome things Right.

199
00:12:17,297 --> 00:12:25,646
Scott: They're making something new called bakuman Uh-huh, and it's actually it's about making manga or something.

200
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:32,649
Scott: But anyway Bakuman you can read it right now But it's not in the store.

201
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,697
Scott: It's also this price scan.

202
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:39,629
Scott: I don't know if there's cancellations or not, but legally you can read it right now.

203
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:51,390
Scott: Because if you go to jump land calm, which is the official, you know shonen jump Kind of website put up by Shueisha, you know, the Japanese publisher of shonen jump.

204
00:12:52,311 --> 00:13:05,090
Scott: they have bakuman available there digitally in English French German and Japanese and You basically download this file and then you download the little reader and you can read it in English.

205
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:07,098
Rym: Wait, so I need a file and a reader.

206
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:08,242
Scott: they give you the reader for free.

207
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:09,387
Rym: But why?

208
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:10,230
Rym: I mean, what kind of format?

209
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:10,955
Rym: I'm just curious.

210
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,770
Scott: It's it's some kind of weird file format.

211
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,230
Scott: I downloaded it just before I came in this room and I didn't actually open it yet.

212
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,645
Rym: so I can't tell you what it's like because I was curious if maybe it's like.

213
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:23,136
Rym: this reader is some sort of Optimized for reading manga thing.

214
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:28,090
Scott: It might be but bakuman actually began and showed and jump like in early august.

215
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,770
Scott: So there are probably cancellations also that you can read if you don't like this particular reader.

216
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,561
Scott: But you know you can.

217
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:45,374
Scott: here we go in English Translated a manga that's coming out right now by a hit team and it's it's in four languages English French German Japanese Is a big move.

218
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:49,190
Scott: now, there's another similar big move that's going down, right?

219
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:56,050
Scott: Yoshitoshi Abe Serial experiments lane, you know him also does some stuff in robot.

220
00:13:59,072 --> 00:13:59,314
Scott: What.

221
00:13:59,354 --> 00:14:00,842
Rym: that's an interesting way of putting that.

222
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:05,859
Scott: yeah, um He made a doujinshi, you know a lot of that's.

223
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,095
Scott: the one thing is that people don't seem to understand is that um, you know Doujinshi isn't just.

224
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:14,850
Scott: you know, I take naruto and make it porn and put it out there.

225
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:17,584
Rym: That's only like 98 of it, right?

226
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:24,665
Scott: That's only 98 Actual real creators, you know professional creators in japan make doujinshi sometimes.

227
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:28,059
Rym: I mean for example, I have you know The azumanga guy azuma.

228
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,647
Rym: I have a doujinshi.

229
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:33,559
Rym: he did Of tenji muyo and it's hilarious, right?

230
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:37,670
Scott: And it's not always a fan, you know parody of of an existing work.

231
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,096
Scott: Sometimes it's an original thing.

232
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:42,110
Scott: I mean, you know in this in the united states, right?

233
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,505
Scott: Let's say I get a job for dc comics and i'm the guy who makes superman.

234
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:48,110
Scott: I write it and I draw it, right?

235
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:49,576
Scott: Let's say i'm frank miller.

236
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:50,741
Scott: I wish right.

237
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,070
Scott: Uh, i'm doing batman or something.

238
00:14:53,731 --> 00:15:02,329
Scott: If I just decide if I decide to go and make some comic on my own Not for any company just for myself right and put it out there.

239
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:07,590
Scott: It's called sin city in the united states and it someone picks it up and publishes it.

240
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:20,067
Scott: But in japan if you go if you're even if you're a professional if you just go out and make something on your own You know, you don't have a publisher tell you to make it or you don't put it in a manga magazine You just sell it at comic cat.

241
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:27,459
Scott: Uh, that's called the doujinshi even if it's not Parodying or using characters from existing works or anything.

242
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,669
Scott: All right, so yoshizobi toshiabe made this doujinshi called pochiama at the pharmacy.

243
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:47,043
Scott: pochiama at the pharmacy Is 53 pages and you can buy it in 20 countries In the itunes app store for five bucks or equivalent.

244
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,106
Scott: I bought it.

245
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:51,658
Scott: I got it on the iphone And I tried to read it and you know what?

246
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:52,501
Scott: It's not.

247
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:53,244
Scott: uh, I don't.

248
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:56,849
Scott: I didn't read more than a couple pages of it So I can't tell you if the manga is good or not.

249
00:15:57,492 --> 00:16:00,244
Scott: But I can tell you is that the translation is terrible.

250
00:16:00,264 --> 00:16:00,846
Scott: Really?

251
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:01,770
Scott: Oh, it's bad.

252
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:05,047
Rym: I was expecting this build up to be that it's great.

253
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:11,130
Scott: Oh Oh the translation it's like it might as well be bootlegs from southeast asia.

254
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,254
Scott: Because at a time like this even at a time like this It is a bad trend.

255
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:19,849
Scott: and the other thing about it right is basically what it's the software that they've built this on.

256
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:27,607
Scott: Uh, it seems like the way it works Is they erase they have the images and you can zoom and pan and that's all good.

257
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,958
Scott: The images are fine With the text.

258
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:43,849
Scott: the way it seems to work, you know My programmer's intuition looking at the interface of a program and then determining how it works underneath Is that in addition to all these image files they have text and then they have you know?

259
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,237
Scott: location on the page And so the font of the text.

260
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,517
Scott: it really doesn't fit in with the images around it and it sort of Crappily fits in the bubbles.

261
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,509
Scott: Sometimes it sticks out and it looks kind of dumb and it's.

262
00:16:58,254 --> 00:17:07,289
Scott: it's not so great, but You know 58 pages a month 53 pages of manga for five bucks on your iphone or ipod touch.

263
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:15,022
Scott: He's trying something, you know, you know, and this it actually, you know I read two pages of it and there were some funny jokes in there because he could.

264
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:21,250
Scott: you can't understand what's going on You know, but it's just a little bit painful with the bad translation at least into english.

265
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:24,042
Scott: It's been translated into 19 other languages too.

266
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:25,269
Scott: So who knows about those?

267
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:26,329
Rym: You know what?

268
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,193
Rym: They probably did.

269
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,364
Rym: is they just translated from each language into every other language?

270
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,070
Rym: and english was like the eighth one along the way.

271
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:33,689
Rym: Who knows who knows?

272
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:47,627
Scott: The point is is they're adding a whole bunch of other Uh mangas to the uh, ab store in japan also with bad translations in america I don't know in japan, but the other ones don't have translations at least not yet.

273
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:55,609
Scott: So You know, if you're if you like yoshitoshi habe which I do, you know if you want to spend I would wait if the translation's bad.

274
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,287
Scott: Yeah, if you want to spend five bucks on a bad translation on your iphone.

275
00:17:59,327 --> 00:17:59,849
Scott: go for it.

276
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:06,716
Scott: I just did it mostly not because I actually wanted it but because I wanted to report on it, you know It's like the same reason.

277
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:12,443
Scott: I just bought four ssh clients for the iphone So I could report on which one was the best.

278
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:13,930
Scott: one of them is useless.

279
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:16,470
Scott: The other ones are all good and bad simultaneously.

280
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:17,256
Scott: So there's.

281
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:23,409
Scott: no there's no one good one not yet But it looks like one of them is the next version is going to be the good one, but it's not out yet.

282
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:31,095
Rym: Anyway enough of that.

283
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:34,270
Rym: we should get right into things of the day so we can actually talk about odecan for a while.

284
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,280
Rym: So my thing of the day luckily is from odecan.

285
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,470
Rym: You see the last panel we did it wasn't actually our panel.

286
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,342
Rym: It was you know a front row crew panel, but it was katsu doing his kendo panel.

287
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:46,810
Rym: and katsu does one hell of a kendo panel.

288
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:49,330
Rym: He does it like every count we go to now and it's always great.

289
00:18:50,034 --> 00:19:01,607
Rym: but uh there was some unfinished business with kendo and maybe I was the undefeated vice president of the kendo club at rit who had never actually attended a meeting and never actually accepted the challenge.

290
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:05,730
Rym: and uh That ended and I present to you the video of me dying.

291
00:19:06,818 --> 00:19:08,369
Rym: Oh my god, is he fast?

292
00:19:09,052 --> 00:19:09,479
Scott: Is that it?

293
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:10,028
Rym: that's it?

294
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:11,034
Rym: This isn't?

295
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:12,321
Rym: we have a better video of this.

296
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:19,854
Rym: In fact, we have two videos of this but Someone else in the audience captured a third video and since it's already on youtube I figured I would just use it.

297
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:30,902
Scott: All right, so check this out, you know, you go to websites maybe our forums maybe you know Twitter something else and a lot of these sites now, especially the social networking sites They need you to have an avatar.

298
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:38,770
Scott: maybe you know I mean it started with buddy icons and aim but now you need an avatar all over the place And a lot of people don't have a good photo of themselves.

299
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:40,856
Scott: So someone made this website.

300
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:45,110
Scott: face your manga.com and it's basically an avatar generator.

301
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:54,243
Scott: It's sort of like a me kind of thing where you you know, choose eyes choose nose choose hair But it makes a manga style you and no matter what combination you pick.

302
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:56,730
Scott: It looks really good and it's it's really really slick.

303
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:59,120
Scott: It's like amazing professional website.

304
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:01,349
Scott: It's free to make an avatar on there.

305
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:02,576
Scott: Uh, there's.

306
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:06,629
Scott: I think you can pay for some other shit, but whatever Go there face your manga.com.

307
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:25,887
Rym: so otakon 2008. now We've realized it's it's often difficult for us to do our reviews or coverage of a lot of conventions because Not so much otakon but like ConnectiCon or often Katsucon we basically are staffed the whole time and as a result our Our perspective is kind of skewed toward the things we do.

308
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:39,490
Rym: because you see When you really think about it And this is something I didn't realize when I first started going to fan conventions not just anime but any sort of convention That it's such a different experience depending on like where you are and what your function is and why you're there.

309
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:51,469
Rym: I mean if i'm a dealer and I go to an anime con I have a completely different experience from a fan Or from someone in the artist alley or from a guest or from a staffer or from a press guy Or from a hobo out in the street.

310
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,971
Scott: Yep, I mean you Listeners.

311
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:59,086
Scott: most likely you are going to a convention as an attendee.

312
00:20:59,106 --> 00:21:00,170
Scott: You want to go to events?

313
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,469
Scott: You want to go to dealer's room?

314
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,742
Scott: You want to go to things and experience them.

315
00:21:04,783 --> 00:21:05,728
Scott: then you paid to get in?

316
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:11,790
Scott: Or maybe you go to artist alley and sit at a table for most of the con but you still go around and experience stuff.

317
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:18,570
Scott: We do something else and it's very unlikely that you will be doing the thing that we did If you go to any of these conventions.

318
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:27,764
Scott: So it's not really helping you to review the convention if we tell you what it was like for us Because that's not what it's going to be like for you.

319
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:28,970
Scott: It's going to be completely different.

320
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:35,149
Rym: But at the same time I remember the window when I first realized like I really realized this I became fascinated with.

321
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,615
Rym: it was a friend of ours.

322
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:58,707
Rym: they actually, you know, they're they're dealers in a lot of the conventions and we talked to them a lot and We were we're in a con one day and we use our press badges and we got in early and we're hanging out in the dealer's Room talking to these people and it was interesting, you know They were telling us about you know loading and getting the dock set up and sitting in the dealer's room all day and dealing with a shoplifter and All the kind of details and stuff that you never even think of.

323
00:21:58,727 --> 00:21:59,330
Rym: you go to a con.

324
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:02,707
Rym: Oh the dealer's room i'll buy that and i'll buy that and i'll buy this and then.

325
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:06,890
Rym: but Actually talking to someone who sat there and did this completely different.

326
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:11,530
Rym: We're both at the same convention for the whole weekend and yet they basically were at a different convention.

327
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,790
Rym: They were at the sit in a small box yelling at kids convention.

328
00:22:15,323 --> 00:22:23,819
Scott: Yep So we're going to try to do this otakon review instead of just telling you what we did in chronological order Which is our typical convention review style.

329
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:26,630
Scott: I mean we've done two otakon reviews in this style.

330
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:33,220
Scott: If you like that style, you can go listen to the old ones because really if we did it for this one It wouldn't be that much different.

331
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,310
Scott: It would be different but not that much different.

332
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,116
Rym: Well, it'd be different.

333
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:41,262
Rym: in regards that I mean in previous otakons We actually did a lot more things at the con as fans.

334
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:44,230
Rym: I would go to panels to see what was going on And actually sit through them.

335
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:49,250
Rym: I'd go to the rave and dance for like an hour, you know all the stuff that you're supposed to do with the con.

336
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:50,950
Rym: We don't have time for that anymore.

337
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:51,206
Rym: No

338
00:22:51,591 --> 00:23:08,729
Scott: So now we're going to try to review the con by telling you we're going to go through all the different Perspectives of people at the con and tell you what it was like from that perspective and obviously some of those perspectives aren't ours But we talked to people while we were there and we can make educated guesses and all such and such and such.

339
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:15,910
Scott: So let's start with the perspective of the special guests the super people who come to the con perhaps the musical guests?

340
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:18,041
Scott: Okay, they have no idea what it's like to be them.

341
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:19,690
Scott: They're super rich and famous and everyone goes.

342
00:23:20,752 --> 00:23:34,110
Rym: Uh, actually just having work staff at other cons the way that works is pretty much you fly in and you're picked up by a con staffer who you know introduces you and drives you to the con and They basically take care of you for the whole weekend and then they make sure you get on your flight home.

343
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:41,610
Rym: Yeah If you're an american voice actor you then proceed to go and get totally smashed And then come back to the con drunk and sit on one of our panels randomly.

344
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:51,285
Scott: One thing I can definitely say though is that the special guests at this convention or at least there were many special guests But the most special of guests at this Otakon was jam project the musical act.

345
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:57,545
Scott: I think one of their members is missing I'm, not sure And I didn't actually get to go to the concert because we had a panel during it.

346
00:23:57,626 --> 00:24:01,449
Scott: Otherwise, I would have gone All right, so I don't know what it was like, but I heard only good things.

347
00:24:01,951 --> 00:24:06,004
Rym: I can say this there were a lot of people who were really like they.

348
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:18,318
Rym: they either weren't aware of the concert Even though they were at the convention or they just they're like, yeah It's not really up my alley and I actually spent much of friday at all our panels and everything I could do Telling people look go to the concert.

349
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:18,780
Rym: Trust me.

350
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,144
Rym: Oh my god, it's in the arena.

351
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:30,339
Rym: It's a real concert live music And every one of these people came back to our table at some point during the con the next day basically saying That was one of the best cons.

352
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,262
Rym: Oh my god.

353
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:33,350
Rym: I I can't believe I was thinking of not going.

354
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,535
Scott: Yeah It was surprising.

355
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:42,030
Scott: i'd go to a panel and i'd say who here's going to the concert tomorrow And like not many people raise their hands and be like what the hell is wrong with you?

356
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,762
Scott: You don't have a panel to run during the concert.

357
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:44,629
Scott: Why are you going to it?

358
00:24:44,911 --> 00:25:07,774
Scott: don't come to my stupid panel, but um We actually walked in on the bandai surprise panel and the bandai surprise was lucky star shirts And jam project and I was only in there for maybe a minute But I could totally tell the jam project was living it up and hanging loose and they were just oh, man They they totally.

359
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:11,990
Scott: there is no doubt that they had a wicked awesome time and they were just letting it all hang out.

360
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,177
Rym: Because I know I mean they.

361
00:25:13,197 --> 00:25:15,130
Rym: they did a full concert in the arena.

362
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:25,429
Rym: and the thing is Before larku came a few years ago and they did a full concert in the arena and I remember that they had a crazy awesome time and they that was like the best thing ever for them.

363
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:31,147
Rym: and These arena concerts I know are very taxing on the odicon staff and on the odicon budget and everything.

364
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:40,290
Rym: but at the same time They're so amazing and I think more than anything else These are starting to really make odicon stand out as like the ultimate anime convention.

365
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,666
Scott: Yep, I mean tmr sent a special message to odicon which the staff read to us at.

366
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:46,910
Scott: I think the closing ceremonies.

367
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,416
Rym: I don't have the text some other time.

368
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:51,127
Rym: It basically was like yeah, you guys are awesome.

369
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:51,930
Rym: I had a good time.

370
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,054
Rym: I want to come back someday.

371
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:54,198
Rym: Omg, lol.

372
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:56,145
Scott: Yeah, he's cool dude that tmr.

373
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:56,828
Scott: Yeah, he is.

374
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:57,390
Scott: All right.

375
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,236
Rym: So, uh, what are we going to start with?

376
00:25:59,276 --> 00:25:59,818
Rym: I mean we can.

377
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,410
Rym: we already said everything about the guest and there's the low-level guest.

378
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:08,983
Rym: But it's not that different except people don't cater to your every whim And usually you disappear.

379
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:09,728
Rym: then they're looking for you.

380
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:15,030
Scott: Let's talk about the artist alley because we do spend a lot of time in the artist alley because we had a table there.

381
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:16,830
Rym: I mean, I remember how to go to early cons.

382
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:27,780
Rym: I'd be amazed that I had friends who would like show up at a con And thursday they'd set up in their artist alley and they would stay at their artist alley table through the entire con And then go home and they wouldn't go to anything.

383
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,070
Scott: and i'd be like, oh, how could you not go to anything?

384
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,852
Rym: So for one odicon's artist alley was handled Magnificently.

385
00:26:34,872 --> 00:26:39,170
Rym: this as usual, I mean the staff are all right there and together everything was organized.

386
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,037
Rym: There was not a single problem with it at all.

387
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:44,210
Scott: You go up you sign up they get your table everything's set.

388
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:46,339
Scott: You can set up your stuff on thursday.

389
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:47,243
Scott: nice and easy.

390
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:48,850
Scott: You have plenty of time.

391
00:26:49,312 --> 00:26:52,504
Scott: everything's all good in terms of setting your stuff up and doing your business.

392
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:58,739
Rym: and the thing is It seems this was the biggest and best Artist alley i've ever seen at an odicon.

393
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:06,712
Scott: the way they arranged those tables allowed for more Take more actual seats and tables than ever ever before and at the same time They eliminated.

394
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:12,270
Rym: the only problem with last year's artist alley was that there are too many people in it and you couldn't walk around.

395
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:17,992
Rym: Yep, this year the aisles were just big like they spread it out just enough to where it was perfect It was.

396
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:19,438
Scott: it was really nice and also the the.

397
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:22,370
Rym: the quality of the art every year just staggers me.

398
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,210
Rym: I mean, I cannot believe some of these people that are just sitting in the artist alley.

399
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:26,932
Scott: there was.

400
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:30,662
Scott: one thing is that it seemed like a lot of the booths there were.

401
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:41,670
Scott: they seemed to be all the same thing like Picture of a character and a gigantic print that was really on shiny glossy paper with shiny glossy printing.

402
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:49,710
Rym: Yeah, it seemed like it seems like the problem there was like at least 10 booths like that Those particular booths and luckily they were at the minority.

403
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:55,450
Rym: I mean most of the stuff there was either really interesting fan art or really good original art or just a lot of neat stuff.

404
00:27:55,873 --> 00:28:04,503
Rym: one guy in the back, which is live djing through the whole thing, but those particular people it's like That fan art is almost I don't want to say obsolete.

405
00:28:04,523 --> 00:28:08,304
Rym: But I mean, it's good art, but It doesn't really add anything to the character.

406
00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:14,149
Rym: It's not like it's special It's just a good rendition of the character as though you would see an official merchandise stuff.

407
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,653
Scott: It's like xkcd.

408
00:28:15,854 --> 00:28:19,404
Scott: right xkcd has no graphical art to it.

409
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:19,986
Scott: That's you know.

410
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:22,536
Scott: quality, you know, it's not bad But it's sick figures.

411
00:28:22,697 --> 00:28:25,050
Rym: it is there are better stick figures than I can draw.

412
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:28,527
Scott: Yeah, it has something to it in its content.

413
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:40,085
Scott: in addition You know that in a lot of this art there a lot of these super glossy prints that a lot that these booths had Has art graphically but it doesn't have anything below the surface.

414
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,349
Scott: There's no heart in it.

415
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:42,773
Scott: There's no Life in it.

416
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:43,595
Scott: There's no content.

417
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:48,290
Scott: It's just a rendering of the character that's shiny and it's not so exciting.

418
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,765
Scott: But that's maybe 10 booths at most and most of the booths were not those.

419
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:57,997
Scott: but it was still kind of weird to see like You know so many, you know Because it's hard no matter where you look.

420
00:28:58,017 --> 00:29:01,290
Scott: there would be one booth like that because there are hundreds of booths in artist alley.

421
00:29:01,812 --> 00:29:04,846
Scott: But there would be one booth like that no matter where you looked and it was kind of like, uh, huh?

422
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:13,444
Rym: Yeah, and I really want to give shout outs, but I don't have time and I don't I have a list but There were a lot of cool people in that alley that we met.

423
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:15,215
Scott: All right, the one shout out I do want to.

424
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:16,890
Rym: you're gonna give it to the radish mart, aren't you?

425
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:21,007
Scott: You knew I was gonna give it to the radish mart, but I bought something from the radish mart.

426
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:21,710
Rym: What did you buy?

427
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,796
Rym: I bought a bookmark.

428
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:23,702
Scott: All right, you did.

429
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:24,869
Rym: It's a really good bookmark, too.

430
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:28,266
Rym: It's got the young radish the older radish and the rotten radish.

431
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:29,110
Scott: So check it out.

432
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,570
Scott: There's this one girl and she set up this booth.

433
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:37,470
Scott: That was the radish mart and she was just selling like stuffed radishes and bookmarks with pictures of radishes on them.

434
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:43,230
Scott: It wasn't really anything, you know complicated but the setup of the booth was like.

435
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:53,442
Scott: It was like oh my gosh she was wearing this costume of radish mart merchant and It was all these radishes and she had these buckets like with little wooden barrels.

436
00:29:53,563 --> 00:29:57,797
Scott: and uh, but the thing is around the corner Was fake radish mart.

437
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:12,710
Rym: well fake radish studios because the deal is the artist there We've we talked a lot of these people and the story was that an anagram of her name is fake radish Which gave her the idea to have fake radish studios and then a radish mart.

438
00:30:13,571 --> 00:30:15,437
Scott: The radish mart booth was just so.

439
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:22,137
Scott: I mean, I don't need a stuffed radish, but the radish mart booth makes you want one Desperately, they're really high quality too.

440
00:30:22,217 --> 00:30:25,770
Rym: Like if you want a stuffed radish, I can't think of a better place to go.

441
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,804
Scott: But I mean just the presentation of the booth.

442
00:30:27,885 --> 00:30:28,530
Scott: Oh my gosh.

443
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:30,682
Rym: Yeah, I mean I walked around.

444
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,910
Rym: I looked at every table.

445
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:34,058
Rym: Most of the art there was amazing.

446
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:34,701
Scott: Yeah.

447
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:36,389
Scott: Oh the art show the art show.

448
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:49,938
Scott: Uh, the art show every year is basically, you know, instead of selling an art at your table You can put it in the art show to have someone buy, you know The auction is a silent auction and then at the end if something gets seven bids It goes to the live auction on sunday.

449
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:57,650
Rym: now granted that a lot of people will put something in the art show nominally to sell It but mostly to get people to see it and then find them in the artist alley and buy prints.

450
00:30:57,871 --> 00:30:59,850
Scott: Yep, it sort of works both ways.

451
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:03,225
Rym: I love the art show and this year actually was better than last year.

452
00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:04,350
Scott: It was much better than last.

453
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,476
Rym: It was a good art show.

454
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:10,379
Scott: There was a lot of really interesting stuff in there And for the first time I won something in the art show.

455
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:10,861
Scott: Yeah.

456
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,850
Rym: Yeah scott bought this really cute thing.

457
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,435
Rym: What's it from?

458
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,190
Scott: I think it's from something called hat.

459
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:19,530
Scott: I didn't know it was from something until after I bought it and there was a url on the bottom of it.

460
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,878
Scott: But it's a it's just.

461
00:31:20,918 --> 00:31:23,030
Scott: basically it's a painting on a little canvas.

462
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:28,050
Scott: It's square and it's of something called the hatpire which is I guess is a vampire that wears a top hat.

463
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:35,110
Scott: But it's basically this little hatpire and he's swimming and there's like a big squid and it's just sort of like yay.

464
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:37,796
Scott: And uh, I it's.

465
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:41,789
Scott: it's the kind of painting you would hang up in the bathroom because it's just sort of watery and happy.

466
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:45,735
Rym: And and it was it was 15 bucks Despite all the good art in there.

467
00:31:45,755 --> 00:32:04,030
Rym: I I have to mention as always the uh adult content area because Last year there was a grand total of one thing in there and that thing was the rod of light which was Basically a crudely drawn penis on a piece of lined paper highlighted.

468
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:14,910
Rym: It was a good time and it had a bit of a dollar and I remember last year on my oticon coverage I basically said You know, it would be hilarious if we took turns bidding it up so that it had to go into the auction.

469
00:32:15,114 --> 00:32:15,810
Scott: That would be great.

470
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,600
Rym: Well this year I went in there to see just to see.

471
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,389
Scott: I was curious if there's anything you gotta go in for the lulls.

472
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,770
Scott: You don't go in to act for series you go in for lulls and also for another reason.

473
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:32,962
Rym: I wanted to prove something to myself that i'll talk about after this because I noticed a trend in the artist alley that is very heartening to me.

474
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:43,210
Rym: But anyway, I walk in there And the first thing I confronted with is actual pornography as in someone took a picture of themselves many pictures of themselves.

475
00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:45,328
Rym: I I don't know.

476
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:58,368
Rym: I mean, I guess it wasn't against the rules and i'm sure the only reason it was in there is because what would be worse Than taking pictures of yourself and trying to sell it in an artist alley at a convention being denied that privilege.

477
00:32:58,508 --> 00:33:02,000
Rym: Yeah But at the same time a little frightening it was.

478
00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:03,144
Scott: it was pretty scary.

479
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:04,890
Scott: I mean, it wasn't super scary.

480
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:08,725
Scott: You'll easily find worse on the internets because you know, it's the internets.

481
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:12,650
Scott: everything is on there But it was kind of disturbing to see it in there.

482
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:17,450
Scott: It's like someone took pictures of themselves in you know, so it had nothing to do with geekery at all.

483
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:22,484
Scott: It was just someone took naked pictures of themselves in sort of scary.

484
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:24,510
Rym: I could have understood if it was cosplay.

485
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:25,636
Rym: Yeah, it wasn't.

486
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:27,224
Scott: it was just scary bondage whatever.

487
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:35,670
Rym: but while I My horrifying disappeared when I looked one step to the right and saw the dracula penis.

488
00:33:36,553 --> 00:33:41,590
Rym: Ah the dracula penis which was in the same vein as the rod of light from the previous year.

489
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,785
Rym: It was probably by the same person but I have to say very very very very.

490
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:47,190
Scott: Dracula penis is the win.

491
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:50,410
Rym: It was bid all the way up and it went into the auction.

492
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:55,327
Rym: I I need to find the staffer who did the auction and find out what came of that.

493
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:56,030
Rym: Oh, really?

494
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,550
Rym: It was bid all the way up and you could see it was two people.

495
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:06,589
Rym: I don't know if they were inspired by us or if just the idea of getting that into the auction is so overpowered You just can't resist it.

496
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:12,530
Scott: This one thing is that the Otakon auction is not perfectly silent because you put you basically works with these barcode stickers.

497
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,449
Scott: It works really well.

498
00:34:13,891 --> 00:34:20,870
Scott: You put the sticker on the bidding thing and it says bidder number like 1010 and then you're right in the dollar amount.

499
00:34:21,232 --> 00:34:35,810
Scott: But someone can look at the bidding list and see you know 1010 2222 1010. they know that both of those visit the same person and thus the auction is not perfectly silent Which is fine because it allows the dracula penis to make it to the art auction.

500
00:34:36,464 --> 00:34:38,094
Rym: Yes But and there were.

501
00:34:38,134 --> 00:34:44,320
Rym: actually it was about 50 50 back there actual pornography versus Just kind of hilarious things that are.

502
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,389
Scott: obviously there's a sequel to the rod of light.

503
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:50,572
Rym: Yes, we've spent too much time talking about we have but here's the point I wanted to make.

504
00:34:50,612 --> 00:34:55,290
Rym: the main reason I went back there was to see if this trend of I don't know.

505
00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:09,030
Rym: It seems like there was almost a backlash Against the yaoi bs that has been pervading anime conventions for the past several years because there was less Less of that garbage to put it bluntly in the artist alley this year than there has ever been.

506
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:10,616
Rym: I mean it was there.

507
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,002
Rym: there were some slashy things.

508
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:22,270
Rym: There were some bl things but a lot of it was Light-hearted ironic or funny or actually very artistic and there was very little of that kind of scary.

509
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:28,149
Rym: You know You go to a lot of artist alleys and you just see people just porn porn porn porn porn porn porn porn And in the dealer's room porn porn porn.

510
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:35,790
Rym: But this year even in the dealer's room Not nearly so much porn and that yaoi guy wasn't yelling nearly as much as he usually does.

511
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,636
Scott: I don't think he was yelling at all.

512
00:35:36,697 --> 00:35:37,281
Scott: At least I didn't.

513
00:35:37,362 --> 00:35:38,430
Scott: I only went to the dealer's room once.

514
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:39,930
Rym: Yeah, I didn't hear him yell at all.

515
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:47,429
Rym: I was very thankful because I have horrible memories of being in the dealer's room and hearing that guy yell and then hearing girls scream just all day.

516
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:53,124
Rym: But really it seems like It's coming around and people are kind of sick of that stuff.

517
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,390
Rym: I it was a fad.

518
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:55,612
Rym: I can't.

519
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,339
Rym: i'm so happy that it was a fad.

520
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,685
Scott: Well, the artist alley kicked ass for you know People buying as well as people selling.

521
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:03,530
Scott: it was totally awesome.

522
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,490
Rym: You know to talk about the perspective of people sitting behind a table.

523
00:36:06,952 --> 00:36:08,199
Rym: We noticed something interesting.

524
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:10,130
Rym: and there's another trend that I didn't quite expect.

525
00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:14,130
Rym: By and large people do not buy prints of things anymore.

526
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:15,915
Scott: No, not a lot.

527
00:36:16,356 --> 00:36:17,279
Rym: No just compared to.

528
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,268
Scott: I mean I bought one but they're not as much as they used to.

529
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:22,350
Rym: but come I mean in the back in the day.

530
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:32,867
Rym: I mean I remember people would bring you know 50 60 prints of something and sell out and it's I don't know if it's because of digital media because most of this art is available on people's deviant art sites.

531
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:39,830
Rym: now if You know, maybe it's the rit anime club wall scroll syndrome where we kind of we broke our local economy.

532
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:53,870
Rym: we had the golden ticket raffles where we would give away wall scrolls to members and Eventually all the hardcore members of the anime club had wall scrolls on every free space of wall in their dorm room And thus did not want to win another wall scroll.

533
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,283
Rym: Maybe people just ran out of space.

534
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:56,948
Rym: I have no idea.

535
00:36:56,988 --> 00:37:03,778
Rym: but By and large and I talked to a lot of artists and they all said the same thing People are not buying prints as much as they used to.

536
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,626
Rym: what they are buying is social currency.

537
00:37:06,947 --> 00:37:18,040
Rym: if you have a Sticker or a button or something that you can carry around or put on your badge or wear a t-shirt something that shows off Your geekery something you can say check me out.

538
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:27,389
Scott: I'm a fan of naruto cell phone charms Necklaces, you know anything that is wearable placeable doable usable anything like that?

539
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:28,918
Scott: Then people are buying.

540
00:37:28,938 --> 00:37:30,550
Scott: if it's a print what can people do with it?

541
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,430
Scott: They put it in a folder to bring it home then they put it in a frame maybe in their house.

542
00:37:34,993 --> 00:37:36,400
Scott: It's not really doing it.

543
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,950
Rym: in terms of the social I think what's really happened Is that back when I used to go to anime conventions?

544
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:47,318
Rym: If I saw a print or a piece of art in an artist alley that was really clever like wow That's hilarious.

545
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,270
Rym: or wow, that's really good.

546
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:54,629
Rym: I would buy it mostly to show to other people and for the novelty of it It's like check this out and I'd show it to people.

547
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:58,750
Rym: But seriously nowadays I can just go to whoever's deviantart and see everything.

548
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:03,050
Scott: Yeah, or if I see something at like an artist alley, that's really clever.

549
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,635
Scott: You know a lot of times it's clever things.

550
00:38:05,675 --> 00:38:07,258
Scott: The art quality is not so great.

551
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:11,150
Scott: Like I saw there was uh, It was like was it a snoopy evangelical?

552
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:22,010
Scott: It was a snoopy lord of the rings mashup I think I saw and I basically just said hey look at that and pointed it out to people I knew who were also in The artist alley and thus there was no need to actually have it and bring it to show anybody.

553
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:28,928
Rym: So I guess people, you know If you want if you're in the artist alley and you want to sell stuff bring your art your art will sell.

554
00:38:28,948 --> 00:38:39,850
Rym: and also It's not so much about selling anymore because a lot of people what they told me was that yeah people didn't buy prints But they took business cards and I made a bunch of friends and we traded a bunch of art.

555
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:43,810
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people were trading prints, but not actually buying and selling prints.

556
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,503
Scott: That's a lot of people do at mocha is they trade their mini comics.

557
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:54,030
Rym: That's always good times Yep, but you know if you're just if you want to sell stuff in an artist alley You've got the clever idea the print bring your prints make a bunch of friends.

558
00:38:54,471 --> 00:39:08,147
Rym: But if you actually want to make money you have to make the clever social currency the clever t-shirt the space makeout button the things that are That in some way people will buy them because they can show off to other people at the con.

559
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:08,809
Rym: All right.

560
00:39:09,452 --> 00:39:12,943
Scott: So for an attendee, that's that's the most important one, right?

561
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:14,528
Scott: What was it like there?

562
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:20,147
Rym: Well, well I guess we should start with the reg line because Has like the best reg lines of any convention ever.

563
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:25,714
Scott: Yeah the reg line was a little bit weird on thursday and that You know, it didn't.

564
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:29,710
Scott: usually it flies like you there'll be no line after like a couple hours.

565
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:34,577
Scott: There was actually a little bit of a line after a couple hours But then again, not that much of a line.

566
00:39:34,617 --> 00:39:35,721
Rym: It was still a real quick.

567
00:39:35,862 --> 00:39:38,553
Scott: It was very quick, but it wasn't stupid quick It was just.

568
00:39:38,653 --> 00:39:40,765
Scott: but yes, it was definitely quick enough.

569
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:41,690
Scott: I did plenty quick.

570
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:41,932
Scott: I didn't

571
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:54,971
Rym: actually verify this with anyone but my guess is that Over the years more and more people are showing up thursday night Because there were a lot of people hanging out around the con thursday night way too many more than last year And

572
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:59,905
Scott: at the front of the reg line It was the same guy the army guy at the front of the reg line from last year.

573
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:00,910
Scott: He didn't die.

574
00:40:01,313 --> 00:40:02,889
Rym: Yeah, remember the guy who we showed up?

575
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:13,570
Rym: We asked him why he was in line and his answer was basically that he was shipping out to iraq the next day But he wanted to be at odicon and be the first one in just because he loves odicon so much.

576
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:21,730
Scott: Yep, I didn't actually get to go talk to him But I did see him from afar and other people said he was there and well, uh, I have to take their word for it.

577
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:22,312
Rym: now.

578
00:40:22,352 --> 00:40:37,752
Rym: the only issue really with reg, I mean panel registration all those sorts of things was fine, but Because we were pressed to this this is delving into us a little bit They had the special needs line, but the special needs line was basically for anyone with an issue anyone who couldn't just you know Walk up.

579
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:38,717
Rym: Here's my free reg.

580
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:39,401
Rym: Give me my badge.

581
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:41,070
Rym: They had to go into the special needs line now.

582
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:45,109
Rym: The idea was you can skip the real line and then have your problem dealt with.

583
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:50,268
Rym: But because everyone with a problem with it was in that line They didn't have a lot of staff over there.

584
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:54,770
Rym: They had a few staff who were very hard working, but I think they needed another special needs booth.

585
00:40:55,852 --> 00:41:00,421
Rym: We got in that line because our press thing way back told us yes You have to go into this line, which we found out later.

586
00:41:00,442 --> 00:41:01,910
Rym: We could have just not gotten into that line.

587
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:03,537
Rym: Yeah, but that's fine.

588
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:04,762
Rym: a staffer came and saved us.

589
00:41:04,803 --> 00:41:10,350
Rym: He pulled us out and got us our badges, but We got into that line skipping the entire outside line.

590
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:14,510
Rym: Our friends with pre-reg badges got into the giant outside line.

591
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,196
Rym: Within a short span.

592
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:21,150
Rym: we saw them and their line get into the building get up get their badges and leave.

593
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:23,102
Rym: Meanwhile, we had moved four feet.

594
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:24,290
Scott: Yeah, it was not good.

595
00:41:24,531 --> 00:41:25,797
Scott: Not good in the special needs line.

596
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,750
Scott: the special needs line needs two or three booths instead of one booth.

597
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:36,761
Rym: See my only real concern is that if I if I had been you know Someone who had a medical condition and you know, the idea was I don't I can't stand in this line I need my badge.

598
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:37,288
Rym: help me out.

599
00:41:38,013 --> 00:41:41,550
Rym: It was faster to stand in the real line than it was to get into the special needs line.

600
00:41:41,591 --> 00:41:42,630
Scott: Yeah, that's a problem.

601
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:45,923
Rym: But I mean that was the only complaint I could see.

602
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,810
Rym: other than that thursday night was super smooth.

603
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:55,942
Rym: Plus people who had odicon badges could go see a screening of I think it was tropic thunder a movie in the area Yeah, and that seemed to go real well.

604
00:41:55,982 --> 00:41:57,530
Rym: a lot of people were real excited about that.

605
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,427
Rym: It gave people something to do on thursday.

606
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,830
Rym: Yeah It's a good tie-in and A lot of people say they want a four-day con again.

607
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,110
Rym: And i'm sure jim bowles if he's listening to this right now about had a heart attack at the mere mention.

608
00:42:09,762 --> 00:42:18,150
Rym: But If odicon does this again make a deal with the area have local venues do stuff that is not directly related to odicon.

609
00:42:18,652 --> 00:42:22,930
Rym: But you know, hey if you have an odicon badge happy hour at the local bar.

610
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:28,853
Rym: Hey, if you have an odicon badge, uh, there's a concert down at the power plant thursday night, you know Something like that.

611
00:42:28,873 --> 00:42:31,304
Rym: The con doesn't have to do any adcon work.

612
00:42:31,324 --> 00:42:32,630
Rym: They only have to do pre-con work.

613
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:38,910
Rym: And it seems like it worked really well with this thing this year And I really hope odicon is able to pull off bigger things next year.

614
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:45,970
Scott: Yeah, just get places to say anyone with an odicon badge special shit for you on thursday And it can be totally awesome.

615
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,559
Scott: I think that's something that other cons should work towards.

616
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:56,889
Scott: also is getting places in the area To do special things for anyone in the badge, you know the day before the day after anything like that.

617
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,057
Rym: Yep, because I mean we actually ran into daryl.

618
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,563
Scott: I know for an example packs.

619
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:04,886
Scott: I just realized looking at the pack schedule Pax doesn't begin until 2 p.m.

620
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:05,290
Scott: Friday.

621
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:15,224
Scott: The seattle area around the convention center should do stuff for packs people with their badges before 2 p.m On friday, but granted odicon did it it worked.

622
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:16,470
Rym: I hope they do it again in the future.

623
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:21,470
Rym: So, uh, yeah friday, you know, actually the regular reg line was gigantic.

624
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:22,615
Rym: There were a lot of people.

625
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:24,926
Rym: i'll tell you right now the the number this year was like 26,000 something.

626
00:43:26,693 --> 00:43:33,790
Rym: but beyond that the general con I mean Actually unlike previous years crowd control was very little of a problem compared to what has been in the past.

627
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:37,683
Rym: I mean It was very easy to get around the con for once and there were.

628
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:39,650
Rym: they didn't seem like they needed as many staffers.

629
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:40,745
Rym: Pushing people around.

630
00:43:40,928 --> 00:43:47,910
Scott: yeah They maintained the same layout as last year utilizing the area in the front under the reg for the dealer's room exit.

631
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:53,790
Scott: But in addition they opened up the doors in the back of the artist's alley to use that as an additional entrance.

632
00:43:53,851 --> 00:43:56,010
Scott: Exit you could actually was brilliant.

633
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:04,790
Rym: It was awesome because one that was an in and out for the artist alley and there was the other main entrance for the artist Alley, but it was only the exit to the dealer's room.

634
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:08,150
Rym: You couldn't enter the dealer's room from back there unless you were a dealer or press or something.

635
00:44:08,692 --> 00:44:18,578
Rym: So as a result people would you know, the dealer's room is crazy crowded and gigantic and people are in there They're coming out and they're kind of funneled into this extra space Thus keeping them out of the rest of the con.

636
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,072
Rym: and you know people can hang out there and chill There.

637
00:44:21,152 --> 00:44:29,270
Rym: extra bathrooms back there, which was real important, but then hey since you're here Here's the artist alley and it just kind of funneled these people.

638
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:35,559
Rym: There's a constant stream of people coming into the artist alley from the back Walking all the way through the tables and going out the front.

639
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,222
Rym: the whole con and as a result the main issue here The back of the artist alley was rocking.

640
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:45,640
Rym: the people who were stuck in the back back corner Had just as much traffic as the people in the front.

641
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:46,885
Scott: Yeah, no longer was it.

642
00:44:46,905 --> 00:44:50,539
Scott: Ah back at the artist alley No one's gonna see me chirp chirp cricket cricket.

643
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:52,145
Scott: It was back the artist alley.

644
00:44:52,245 --> 00:44:54,129
Scott: Oh, yeah better than the middle All right.

645
00:44:54,411 --> 00:45:02,565
Scott: the other thing was I was using the artist alley is pretty much a shortcut to get under most of the con because It had an entrance on one side and exit on the other side.

646
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:10,870
Scott: so I could go Both ways through the artist alley rather than going upstairs through the crowds walking in the hallways to get from one side to the other.

647
00:45:11,558 --> 00:45:17,390
Rym: Now the dealer's room If you've never been to an odeacon before and you've never listened to our previous shows about an odeacon.

648
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:19,630
Rym: You can go to them to hear all about it.

649
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:26,295
Rym: But basically the dealer's room at odeacon is bigger than you're imagining and whatever you're thinking about right now It's bigger than that.

650
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:28,270
Rym: It is gigantic.

651
00:45:28,814 --> 00:45:30,710
Rym: It is bigger than most conventions.

652
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:36,910
Scott: Think of like, you know the size of three best buys and it's all anime store.

653
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:42,470
Rym: That's what the odeacon dealer's room was like and it was Actually, I think it was better than last year in a lot of ways too.

654
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,984
Rym: There were the dealers were had a lot more stuff.

655
00:45:45,004 --> 00:45:46,030
Rym: There was a lot more variety.

656
00:45:46,532 --> 00:45:54,209
Rym: There were fewer porn peddlers and while there were a lot of those sword dealers They there didn't seem to be nearly as many as there were last year.

657
00:45:54,751 --> 00:46:03,360
Scott: yeah, there were also lots of people actually selling lots of dvds and lots of manga at Decent prices and with a lot of pretty good selection.

658
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,624
Rym: I actually bought the whole.

659
00:46:04,644 --> 00:46:06,089
Rym: I bought all of the deshigo for like 30 bucks.

660
00:46:06,711 --> 00:46:07,113
Rym: Well, that's.

661
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:10,730
Scott: the other thing is that there's all since all the companies are sort of going downhill.

662
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,442
Scott: There was lots of blowouts on stuff.

663
00:46:12,482 --> 00:46:19,226
Scott: You can get basically 80 v leftovers, you know wicked cheap lots and lots of slim case boxes.

664
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:20,429
Scott: It was pretty much.

665
00:46:21,233 --> 00:46:32,943
Scott: Oh, man's if you had money at odeacon and you wanted anime stuff You were going to be in good time and I saw stuff that wasn't on the internets, you know It wasn't so good maybe for the robot buying but for the manga dvd buying.

666
00:46:32,963 --> 00:46:34,990
Scott: it was right up there with the awesomes.

667
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:46,604
Rym: Yeah the only thing I really didn't see that I kind of wanted and I don't know why because I see him less and less was I need I had a really nice utenna pin that I used to always like put on my lapel Pretty much anywhere I went, you know dressed up nice.

668
00:46:46,664 --> 00:46:50,750
Rym: I was a little lieutenant pin And I eventually lost it because you know those things wear out.

669
00:46:51,771 --> 00:46:55,644
Rym: I could not find anywhere in that dealer's room high quality pins.

670
00:46:55,905 --> 00:46:57,470
Scott: There were a lot of that misato pin.

671
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:04,989
Rym: Yeah, there was and while the art was high quality the actual manufacturing quality of that pin was very low And I suspect that it was a bootleg.

672
00:47:05,714 --> 00:47:10,137
Rym: I highly suspect most of those are yes, but You used to be able to get.

673
00:47:10,157 --> 00:47:13,258
Rym: this is my only gripe and it's not a gripe with odeacon It's just a gripe with anime dealers.

674
00:47:13,278 --> 00:47:13,781
Rym: What can I do?

675
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:18,430
Rym: I should just buy it online, but I could not find high quality pins anywhere.

676
00:47:19,055 --> 00:47:25,850
Rym: Yeah, but of course all the cool people were in there Like, you know, there's always that the table selling the old like leji matsumoto movie posters.

677
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,319
Scott: Oh, it's that same guy every year every year.

678
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:29,101
Rym: I say wow.

679
00:47:29,443 --> 00:47:31,550
Rym: I really want that arcadia of my youth poster.

680
00:47:31,954 --> 00:47:33,226
Rym: Wow, it's seventy dollars.

681
00:47:33,306 --> 00:47:40,930
Scott: every year He has that same non-bootleg wall scrolls of like ronma hanging up there for like hundreds of dollars and he never sells them.

682
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:43,400
Rym: But there they are and I always want them.

683
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,810
Scott: I can always go over there and say hey you see that.

684
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:47,676
Scott: Yeah, that's a real wall scroll.

685
00:47:47,777 --> 00:47:50,186
Scott: You're not going to see any others like that around here.

686
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:51,410
Scott: These are all bootlegs.

687
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:57,105
Scott: Yes, even those that every single booth is selling all bootleg or that they're american.

688
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,770
Rym: It's it's a tricky subject.

689
00:47:58,973 --> 00:48:00,872
Rym: Yeah, we don't really need to get into that I know we don't.

690
00:48:01,093 --> 00:48:05,892
Rym: let's just say that wall scrolls in america are not quite held to the same standard as wall scrolls were In japan,

691
00:48:05,952 --> 00:48:16,089
Scott: no, but as for what, you know while we're talking about what it's like to shop in the dealer's room, basically Uh, if you've never bought, you know had access to anime goods before and you don't buy stuff online

692
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,396
Rym: You'll have a nerdgasm.

693
00:48:17,456 --> 00:48:18,059
Rym: Oh my god.

694
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:23,760
Scott: Oh my god, if you're a dealer Right mad money's raking it in people.

695
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,550
Scott: I saw people buying stuff all over the place.

696
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,795
Scott: It was not every like.

697
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:31,189
Scott: oh it seemed like everyone walking around the con is some bag with something in it.

698
00:48:31,591 --> 00:48:37,750
Scott: You know, we interviewed actually people sitting at the front of the dealer's room line because we were like, why are people waiting it?

699
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,649
Scott: You know, why do people wait in the dealer's room line every year, you know?

700
00:48:41,113 --> 00:48:43,170
Scott: Is do you really need to get in there right away?

701
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,601
Scott: Is something really going to sell out that you want so desperately there?

702
00:48:46,622 --> 00:48:48,026
Rym: and almost everyone we talked to.

703
00:48:48,067 --> 00:48:50,898
Rym: their answer was basically Yes, I want this thing.

704
00:48:50,918 --> 00:48:52,605
Rym: It sold out last year.

705
00:48:52,726 --> 00:48:53,730
Rym: I'm not going to miss it again.

706
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,140
Scott: I can't buy it online because it's hard to import.

707
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,245
Scott: It's too expensive.

708
00:48:57,325 --> 00:49:00,777
Scott: I you know and uh The people the prices are higher.

709
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:01,941
Scott: the shipping costs whatever.

710
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:06,259
Scott: i'm buying the dealer's room and a lot of the people wanted like import video Games and stuff like that.

711
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:08,450
Scott: So import video games are big money.

712
00:49:08,872 --> 00:49:16,717
Rym: Someone was making money in the dealer's room and a lot of people were selling import video games Which tells me something really interesting.

713
00:49:16,757 --> 00:49:17,439
Rym: now think of this.

714
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:26,722
Rym: the anime industry is basically collapsing in the united states Yet The industry around it is largely thriving.

715
00:49:26,762 --> 00:49:33,384
Rym: I mean you go to that dealer's room and More money probably changed hands there than went into advs coffers last year.

716
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:42,930
Scott: Yeah, I know if you look The video games with anime characters in them are probably selling better than the dvds with those same anime characters in them.

717
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:44,530
Scott: It's kind of crazy.

718
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:55,243
Rym: But I mean people were buying stuff like crazy and people were buying like 70 80 90 Imported video games that they could probably if they wanted to pirate.

719
00:49:55,563 --> 00:50:05,190
Rym: probably the fact that they're buying them Is really interesting to me and it it really starts to hurt the idea that piracy is the only thing destroying the anime industry.

720
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:08,287
Scott: Yep, there's also someone near the front of that line who went to rit.

721
00:50:08,307 --> 00:50:10,039
Scott: They were like, yeah I went to a really nerdy school.

722
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:10,945
Scott: We're like was it rit?

723
00:50:10,965 --> 00:50:12,473
Rym: They're like, yeah No, but he went.

724
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:14,682
Rym: he was funny because we're like was it rit?

725
00:50:14,722 --> 00:50:15,285
Rym: and he stopped.

726
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:17,594
Rym: she's like, uh, Yeah, it was.

727
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:20,005
Scott: and we're like, how did you know what's up?

728
00:50:20,386 --> 00:50:22,678
Rym: and i'm like yeah I was the president of your anime club.

729
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:24,327
Rym: He's like i'm in that anime club.

730
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:26,474
Rym: Yep Thank god, though.

731
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:28,502
Rym: He didn't know who I was for.

732
00:50:28,622 --> 00:50:28,743
Rym: It's.

733
00:50:28,803 --> 00:50:30,510
Rym: finally there's a generation at rit.

734
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,597
Rym: You don't know who the hell I am.

735
00:50:31,617 --> 00:50:32,907
Rym: I could i'm done.

736
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:33,370
Rym: I'm gone.

737
00:50:33,571 --> 00:50:37,071
Scott: Actually rit was representing pretty strong at the otakad I saw.

738
00:50:37,091 --> 00:50:44,676
Scott: I saw at least two people with rit shirts and then add in the people that said rit that weren't actually Wearing any rit stuff.

739
00:50:44,737 --> 00:50:49,140
Rym: a lot of people came up to our table in the artist alley and we're like, yeah Blah blah rit anime.

740
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,878
Rym: and I was like word to your mother Yeah, do you know these people that I I?

741
00:50:52,938 --> 00:50:56,130
Scott: they were like the last people I met before I never went to rochester again.

742
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:57,115
Scott: And i'm like, yeah, I know them.

743
00:50:57,156 --> 00:50:58,583
Scott: Those are the last people I met.

744
00:50:58,624 --> 00:50:59,770
Scott: they were from the anime club before.

745
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,110
Rym: Yeah, people come up and like yeah, I was there when president so and so was present.

746
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,114
Rym: I'm like, yeah.

747
00:51:04,134 --> 00:51:07,067
Rym: Well, I was the president before the person before the person before that person.

748
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:09,996
Scott: Yeah Uh good times good times.

749
00:51:10,338 --> 00:51:12,306
Rym: Yeah, but uh, I really want to get into.

750
00:51:12,326 --> 00:51:15,609
Rym: you know, I don't want to go forever On this review, but let's talk a little bit about panels now.

751
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:19,250
Rym: Last year otakon had some trouble with the panels department.

752
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,596
Rym: You can listen to our review and we talked all about what happened.

753
00:51:21,637 --> 00:51:26,390
Rym: But this year the panels people particularly omar and meredith.

754
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,445
Rym: They had their act together to a degree that was frightening.

755
00:51:30,585 --> 00:51:42,316
Rym: otakon put on As far as I could see and from what everyone that I talked to said The best panels as a whole that they have ever had in terms of quality and perhaps quantity I mean, well, I don't know.

756
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:43,039
Scott: i've seen panel.

757
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:50,043
Scott: I've seen conventions that have more panels Technically like that new york comic con and technically like 200 something panels is ridiculous.

758
00:51:50,464 --> 00:51:54,232
Scott: But the quality of the panels was Outstanding.

759
00:51:54,332 --> 00:52:04,307
Scott: now absolutely every single panel before our panels every single panel I walked in on Every last one was like top tier quality of panel.

760
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:05,250
Rym: I mean look we did anime.

761
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:12,868
Rym: You should see on friday right early more like at noon We walked in, you know during the panel before it dubs that time forgot that was mike tool.

762
00:52:12,888 --> 00:52:15,256
Scott: that Was amazing.

763
00:52:15,396 --> 00:52:18,630
Scott: Oh my god, and we only saw 10 minutes of it, but I knew it was amazing.

764
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:21,487
Scott: And afterwards I was like, oh you're mike tool that awesome guy.

765
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:25,945
Rym: No wonder Yeah, and you know like every panel there's this panel on samurai and ninja.

766
00:52:25,985 --> 00:52:27,410
Rym: that was right before one of our other panels.

767
00:52:27,593 --> 00:52:28,549
Rym: It's also amazing.

768
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:38,630
Rym: and you know, I went around with the kind of the press pass and I poked my head into all the full panels to see what was going on and Every single panel I laid eyes on was extremely well put together.

769
00:52:40,652 --> 00:52:43,384
Rym: And part of that, you know, as we said was that otakon the staff.

770
00:52:43,685 --> 00:52:48,790
Rym: they were really good about Reading out panelists who either wouldn't do a good job or wouldn't be professional.

771
00:52:49,314 --> 00:52:50,767
Rym: They made panelists check in.

772
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:56,468
Rym: make you know They made sure the panelists were there who were going to do their panel and that worked with the only exception.

773
00:52:56,488 --> 00:53:06,147
Rym: I think was this toho panel that apparently a lot of people wanted to go to and the panelists didn't run and there was some Minor debacle there, but other than that the panels were fantastic.

774
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:09,503
Scott: Yep Another thing there was this rakugo guy.

775
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:10,810
Scott: You want to talk let's talk about him for a minute.

776
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,656
Rym: Yes, this was more of an event than a panel.

777
00:53:12,676 --> 00:53:17,070
Rym: now rakugo is this traditional form of japanese comedic storytelling.

778
00:53:17,191 --> 00:53:20,830
Scott: Yes, basically, it's sit down comedy instead of stand up comedy.

779
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:27,596
Scott: This guy sits on a pillow right kneels on it and he has a fan And some chopsticks.

780
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:30,887
Rym: right and no no, he has a fan and a towel.

781
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:31,710
Scott: Oh fan and a towel.

782
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,136
Rym: He does not have chopsticks, right?

783
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:35,346
Scott: He folds the fan together and it becomes chopsticks.

784
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:36,170
Rym: Ah, he fooled you.

785
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:37,074
Rym: I see he did.

786
00:53:37,355 --> 00:53:45,950
Scott: he has a fan and a towel and he sits on this pillow kneels on it And while he sits there, he tells you his story and it's always a hilarious story.

787
00:53:46,113 --> 00:53:55,070
Rym: now the cool thing is I mean This is a traditional japanese art and you can read all about it But the man who performed at otakon was sent basically by the japanese government.

788
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,078
Rym: He travels the world because he speaks english.

789
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:12,004
Rym: So he does this traditional japanese comedic art form In english for american audiences and he goes around the world Spreading rakugo and showing people check this out And it was super awesome.

790
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:12,890
Scott: It was so great.

791
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:17,670
Scott: The only there's one criticism of it is that he had this big panel and it was so great.

792
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:24,088
Scott: But he spent a lot of the panel teaching what rakugo was rather than actually doing rakugo.

793
00:54:24,108 --> 00:54:33,686
Scott: He only did Full on rakugo and actually telling funny stories for maybe like the last Five ten minutes of the panel and I just wish he would have done that the whole time.

794
00:54:33,747 --> 00:54:34,409
Scott: people get it.

795
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:38,349
Scott: You know, you don't have to spend half the panel telling us what you're gonna do.

796
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,462
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like, you know, you don't see a hockey player.

797
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:44,639
Scott: come in and say i'm along and hit the puck Into the goal.

798
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,849
Scott: It's like no just do it.

799
00:54:45,909 --> 00:54:48,090
Scott: I You know i'll figure it out.

800
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:52,569
Rym: See the thing is I mean he came to otakon not really knowing what to expect and he's he hasn't.

801
00:54:52,629 --> 00:54:55,259
Rym: I mean He was trying to figure out how to do this how to?

802
00:54:55,419 --> 00:54:57,226
Scott: actually I understand why he did it that way.

803
00:54:58,592 --> 00:55:03,125
Rym: But on the other hand, it's like, okay, we get it You know, but I think he still did a really good job and it was.

804
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:03,750
Scott: he was amazing.

805
00:55:04,173 --> 00:55:05,160
Rym: He's going to be performing.

806
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,550
Rym: I forget when i'll have to look it up again.

807
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:11,180
Rym: I'll let you guys know in the forum in new york city Sometime in the near future

808
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:13,090
Scott: as well as some other cities in the us

809
00:55:13,431 --> 00:55:19,663
Rym: And if we i'm gonna find out if he's doing just like a full normal ad because if that's the case You can bet your butt that we're gonna be there.

810
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,895
Rym: Oh, man But the thing.

811
00:55:21,915 --> 00:55:23,039
Scott: i'm sad I forgot the guy's name.

812
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:24,183
Scott: I don't have the con book on me.

813
00:55:24,344 --> 00:55:26,810
Rym: the thing that really made me happy Was that you know?

814
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,412
Rym: We we show.

815
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:33,429
Rym: we walked over about a half hour 45 minutes before the event was going to start because they had a a seating time a lineup time.

816
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:36,323
Rym: The line for this was insane.

817
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:38,294
Rym: The panel

818
00:55:38,314 --> 00:55:39,900
Scott: filled up and it was one of the bigger

819
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:49,105
Rym: panel rooms to the point that the line went all the way down One hallway and then they cut it off and formed a new line that went all the way down the other hallway And then they had people at both ends telling people not to line up.

820
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:50,030
Rym: It was already full.

821
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,732
Scott: It was the second biggest panel room and it was full up 100.

822
00:55:53,732 --> 00:55:55,299
Rym: See i'm sure there was worry.

823
00:55:55,339 --> 00:55:56,765
Rym: I mean, what if people don't come?

824
00:55:56,805 --> 00:55:57,970
Rym: what if this was all a big waste?

825
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,094
Rym: Are people interested in this?

826
00:55:59,435 --> 00:56:07,110
Rym: and i'm very heartened by you anime fans for the fact that you all Really thought this would be cool and wanted to see it and the fact that everyone seemed to get it.

827
00:56:07,211 --> 00:56:14,110
Rym: Everyone seemed to enjoy it And i'll admit sadly the only reason we were able to get in is because we had our press passes.

828
00:56:14,653 --> 00:56:17,350
Rym: Otherwise by the time we got there we couldn't have gotten into this thing.

829
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:21,363
Scott: Yeah, and that was actually something that was the one problem that I noticed.

830
00:56:21,383 --> 00:56:23,550
Scott: that was the biggest problem at the convention this year.

831
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:28,278
Scott: And if that's the biggest problem, you know, not too bad The biggest problem is that things are too popular.

832
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:29,242
Rym: exactly people

833
00:56:29,422 --> 00:56:47,650
Scott: things at this convention, you know They use a hundred percent of the space they can't use any more of it and many of the things that are happening were just too popular and People would line up for things well before they were over And sometimes they would clear the room out.

834
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:48,554
Scott: sometimes they wouldn't.

835
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:53,950
Rym: now despite a few people tried to complain about this at the feedback session, but Otakon actually makes it very clear.

836
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:59,857
Rym: They only clear out the room before an event if they have scheduled a hey We're clearing out the room before this event.

837
00:56:59,997 --> 00:57:10,324
Scott: or if it's an 18 plus event that follows a non 18 plus event Then they clear the room also for obvious reasons Yes But otherwise they don't clear the room which I guess is an okay policy.

838
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:14,409
Scott: because the problem with clearing the room is this You clear the room let's say you clear the room.

839
00:57:14,892 --> 00:57:20,639
Scott: That means the people who are waiting in line for the event get to go in and they're going to get a seat Whatever seat they want.

840
00:57:20,942 --> 00:57:21,829
Scott: that's kind of good.

841
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:23,494
Scott: The problem is what?

842
00:57:23,534 --> 00:57:27,610
Scott: if people really did want to see two events in a row now, they're fucked.

843
00:57:27,851 --> 00:57:35,250
Scott: They can't possibly see the second event because they're not in line They're going to get kicked out of the room while they're in it sent to the back of the line and they're screwed.

844
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:40,727
Scott: That's not really so great because usually similar events are scheduled next to each other.

845
00:57:40,747 --> 00:57:41,490
Scott: because it makes sense.

846
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:43,191
Rym: but I mean really I mean You can't.

847
00:57:43,232 --> 00:57:51,810
Rym: it's not a thing you can really complain about because there's really nothing that can be done about it Other than having a lot fewer panels and having spaces between them and staggering it out.

848
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,918
Rym: But that doesn't really serve Otakon's purposes.

849
00:57:53,979 --> 00:57:54,561
Scott: No, it doesn't.

850
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:56,770
Scott: so the other solution never clear the room.

851
00:57:57,152 --> 00:58:06,830
Scott: Okay, so now i'll just camp out in this room see two panels I don't care about just so i'll be in a good seat for the third panel Which I do care about which is going to be crazy crowd.

852
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:10,824
Rym: Basically if they clear the rooms out all the time half of Otakon will complain.

853
00:58:11,165 --> 00:58:13,735
Rym: if they don't clear the rooms out The other half will complain.

854
00:58:13,795 --> 00:58:15,442
Scott: It's a it's a no-win situation.

855
00:58:15,523 --> 00:58:15,965
Scott: Luckily.

856
00:58:16,085 --> 00:58:19,215
Rym: It's a moot point because I actually got a chance.

857
00:58:19,255 --> 00:58:23,650
Rym: I walked over and I looked around the new wing of the convention center.

858
00:58:24,456 --> 00:58:26,052
Rym: It is gigantic.

859
00:58:26,373 --> 00:58:29,286
Rym: it is connected via a skyway like just from you know, where the rave is.

860
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:33,650
Rym: there's like a sky Way that goes across the street to the rest of the convention center.

861
00:58:34,373 --> 00:58:37,769
Rym: And i'm not sure exactly how Otakon is going to be using this space.

862
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:45,489
Rym: but Believe me when I say that i'm going to be following up with them And talking to them to find out what they're going to do because that space is going to allow them to.

863
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:56,316
Rym: I think next year's Otakon is going to transcend all Otakon's previous in terms of layout in terms of function in terms of lines because There's so much more space.

864
00:58:56,477 --> 00:58:58,023
Rym: Yeah, they can do so much like.

865
00:58:58,063 --> 00:58:59,630
Scott: I think it'll be two years from now.

866
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:04,588
Scott: That'll be transcending because they I think they need a year to learn to use the space properly.

867
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:13,690
Scott: true The first year it'll still be great because they'll be using this extra space but in the second year They'll realize fully how to use the space most efficiently.

868
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:17,930
Rym: But the staff has already been doing walkthroughs and it it's looking to shape up pretty nicely.

869
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:21,829
Rym: There's that whole new hotel the hilton right there kind of connected to this thing.

870
00:59:22,353 --> 00:59:24,348
Rym: Apparently there's a million panel rooms in there.

871
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:25,900
Rym: I could I don't know what they'll do.

872
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:29,197
Rym: I got a lot of crazy ideas But maybe i'll save all that for a future.

873
00:59:29,238 --> 00:59:32,650
Rym: show what I would do if I had any say in how Otakon has run.

874
00:59:32,811 --> 00:59:33,621
Scott: Right, right, right.

875
00:59:34,842 --> 00:59:40,587
Scott: But yeah There were some events that were very difficult to get into even if you lined up well in advance.

876
00:59:40,687 --> 00:59:43,717
Rym: most for example The uh, there was a phoenix right kind of like.

877
00:59:44,078 --> 00:59:47,770
Rym: it was basically a long cosplay skit that these people wanted to do as an event.

878
00:59:48,132 --> 00:59:50,890
Rym: You know, they're all in costume and they kind of acted out a phoenix right trial.

879
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:55,356
Rym: the line for this thing Was already larger than the.

880
00:59:55,617 --> 01:00:00,450
Rym: basically people waited for two hours and still didn't get into this event.

881
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:03,424
Scott: Yeah, and they feel it was the largest panel room.

882
01:00:03,705 --> 01:00:04,610
Scott: the room filled up.

883
01:00:04,831 --> 01:00:07,549
Scott: We went in with our press badges to see what was going on.

884
01:00:08,551 --> 01:00:11,850
Scott: It was pretty corny to be honest what was going on up there.

885
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:19,079
Scott: It felt like it could have been good if they put more effort into it and were a little more Professional and clean and more prepared.

886
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,367
Rym: but at the same time it was weird because the half the crowd seemed to be really Really digging it.

887
01:00:23,651 --> 01:00:32,582
Rym: but there were other people there who were just kind of playing on their ds and they were kind of walking out or And I looked into picto chat and it was well, it was basically just penises picto chat's not useful for anything Yeah.

888
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:43,770
Scott: But anyway, it was you know, it was still pretty amazing that hey, there's this huge huge panel Oh my gosh, and I feel like with new space and with you know, Otakon could have a lot of events like that.

889
01:00:44,212 --> 01:00:54,165
Scott: And I imagine if you put a phoenix right trial and then something else Equivalently appealing to the audience in another place simultaneously I think that would solve a lot of the problems.

890
01:00:54,608 --> 01:00:57,926
Scott: Yep uh of lining up for things but mostly what the?

891
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:06,441
Scott: The problem that the things we had to wait in line for that were problematic were the live action 18 plus showings that happened on friday and saturday night.

892
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:08,970
Rym: Let's talk a little bit about the showings video rooms, whatever.

893
01:01:09,131 --> 01:01:23,279
Rym: I don't really watch stuff but the live action asian cinema and in classic otakon fashion They did in fact have the asian tasteless movies late at night in video five, yep let's see the movies were tokyo gore police, which is uh, So other.

894
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,877
Scott: I didn't see it But the people who did see it said it was very nice With the many gores.

895
01:01:27,977 --> 01:01:30,550
Rym: a lot of people said it was the best of the tasteless movies.

896
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:32,398
Scott: Uh, so sad because I didn't see that one.

897
01:01:33,061 --> 01:01:34,086
Scott: Uh, there was a movie.

898
01:01:34,106 --> 01:01:38,615
Rym: Uh, the one after that was Don't you have it pulled up?

899
01:01:39,077 --> 01:01:44,688
Scott: Oh, no the one before it would think was bohachi bushido Which is based on a kazuo koike manga.

900
01:01:44,808 --> 01:01:48,160
Rym: now I the only reason I didn't stay this is the only.

901
01:01:48,301 --> 01:01:57,763
Rym: the only complaint I personally had with otakon was that In some of the video rooms the subtitles were too low on the screen So you could not read them unless you were in the front row.

902
01:01:57,783 --> 01:01:58,850
Scott: because I mean it's obvious.

903
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,054
Scott: There's no stadium seating.

904
01:02:00,255 --> 01:02:04,310
Scott: obvious, you know, it's just a bunch of chairs laid out flat with the projector in the aisle.

905
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:13,442
Scott: Okay, you can't fix that but you can aim the projector higher, you know, because it's a wide screen movie You don't need black at the top of the screen.

906
01:02:13,804 --> 01:02:14,750
Scott: Just aim it higher.

907
01:02:15,092 --> 01:02:18,708
Scott: You can use the remote control to do it and everyone be able to see the subtitles.

908
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:20,197
Rym: sadly I talked to the tech guys.

909
01:02:20,217 --> 01:02:21,446
Rym: I was like, hey, can you do something?

910
01:02:21,486 --> 01:02:21,969
Rym: They said no.

911
01:02:22,331 --> 01:02:23,576
Rym: So I talked to an otakon staffer.

912
01:02:23,596 --> 01:02:24,621
Rym: He's like now we're not.

913
01:02:24,761 --> 01:02:26,870
Scott: well, some people aren't allowed to touch the projector.

914
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,177
Scott: You need someone who's allowed to touch it.

915
01:02:28,237 --> 01:02:30,750
Scott: Yes, and the people who are allowed to touch it leave earlier.

916
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:37,970
Scott: They're not there, you know 11 o'clock at night, but regardless that movie Actually looked really good.

917
01:02:38,151 --> 01:02:45,430
Scott: We just couldn't stay there for more than like 15 minutes because not being able to read the subtitles Through the person in front of me's head was not worth it.

918
01:02:45,490 --> 01:03:02,575
Rym: I mean it started out weird and scary and actually in the beginning I almost wanted to walk out because I thought it was going to be really kind of disgusting and tasteless and not in the good Way, but then like there's a twist about 10 minutes in and that made the movie go from scary and perverted to Hilarious and amazing.

919
01:03:02,615 --> 01:03:04,944
Scott: It was totally you could tell right away.

920
01:03:05,044 --> 01:03:13,030
Scott: It was all Kazuo Koike You know, he only wrote the manga that it was based on but it had a strong influence on the movie, super strong.

921
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:22,477
Rym: I had an idea because you know, but I'll admit this is the one time in the entire convention where I Slightly abused my press pass.

922
01:03:22,839 --> 01:03:26,310
Rym: All right, because the line to get in to see this movie was crazy.

923
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:31,150
Rym: So I walk up and we're like, hey, we're press we'd like to cover this event and the staffer stops.

924
01:03:31,191 --> 01:03:37,670
Rym: He says wait a minute You want to cover a really violent tasteless movie that we're showing at this con late at night.

925
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:43,860
Rym: and I said yes, and he stands there and he says That's the most awesome thing i've heard all night.

926
01:03:44,141 --> 01:03:44,784
Rym: go right in.

927
01:03:45,105 --> 01:03:46,170
Scott: Yeah, that's good times.

928
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:49,406
Rym: So I stood in the front of the room and as people walked in I walked around.

929
01:03:49,446 --> 01:03:51,737
Rym: I asked people You know, do you know what this movie is?

930
01:03:51,778 --> 01:04:02,022
Rym: I kind of interviewed all these people around the room and Half the audience was like this is some Kazuo Koike thing Oh my god, and the other half were like, I don't know i'm just here.

931
01:04:02,323 --> 01:04:10,817
Rym: so I started explaining to people who didn't know What this movie was and who Kazuo Koike was and all that business and they were really interested.

932
01:04:10,897 --> 01:04:19,969
Rym: and actually a few people the next day came up to me at the artist alley and were like man, I went Kazuo Koike and I looked up and you guys should do that at more video showings.

933
01:04:20,049 --> 01:04:22,650
Rym: and What if this is a crazy idea?

934
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:28,849
Rym: this is the kind of thing that would need a lot of dedicated volunteers because There's no way Otakon could provide staff to do this.

935
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,249
Rym: What if you had showing rooms?

936
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:38,608
Rym: Maybe not all of them but select showings that had an MC where instead of just people file in you show a film It's people file in.

937
01:04:39,235 --> 01:04:44,166
Rym: Someone is up at the front of the room They talk for maybe five ten minutes about what you're about to see.

938
01:04:44,206 --> 01:04:49,630
Rym: they explain, you know This is directed by so-and-so or this is a Kazuo Koike based on this movie.

939
01:04:49,932 --> 01:04:53,553
Rym: If you don't know who Kazuo Koike is lone wolf and cub and such Oh my god.

940
01:04:53,614 --> 01:04:54,197
Rym: and just kind of.

941
01:04:54,699 --> 01:04:55,021
Rym: do that.

942
01:04:55,061 --> 01:05:05,909
Rym: do a short really quick panel 10 minutes at most about the movie and then give some context And then let people watch the movie and then after the movie have a short discussion and then let everyone go.

943
01:05:06,672 --> 01:05:21,880
Scott: Yeah, I definitely think that certain video showings especially showings of you know Uh videos that have a history to them or you know There could be definitely be enhanced by some sort of MC Briefing the audience before or after the showing.

944
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:22,762
Rym: now even better.

945
01:05:23,043 --> 01:05:30,048
Rym: look at the anime showing rooms, which honestly I feel as though anime showing rooms are an artifact a holdover.

946
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:34,050
Rym: There's something that does not need to exist as they did in the old days.

947
01:05:34,151 --> 01:05:36,855
Scott: You don't need that many of them Anyway, it's more it also.

948
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:41,466
Rym: I mean there are a lot of people surprisingly who come to anime cons to watch anime but not that many.

949
01:05:41,487 --> 01:05:43,395
Rym: but You don't need a showing room.

950
01:05:43,415 --> 01:05:48,330
Rym: that's showing like eight episodes of a show or an entire show or anything like that.

951
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:52,970
Scott: Well, some of them you need basically to satisfy the industry, you know, they come in they set up a booth.

952
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:56,390
Scott: They're like we want you to show this anime so that people will come in and buy it.

953
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:04,030
Rym: But at the same time Otakon is classically known for not being beholden to the industry and they could just say no Yeah, yeah, we'll see anyway.

954
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,561
Rym: But what if instead I would like to see showing rooms that are not?

955
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:10,210
Rym: we are showing the first four episodes of slayers revolution.

956
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:17,804
Rym: But imagine if there's a showing room called So you want to get into anime or you've already seen bleach watch.

957
01:06:17,864 --> 01:06:28,029
Rym: next like showing rooms Or showing room events that are like an hour two three hours long That are themed or titled or set up like a panel.

958
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:29,636
Scott: So it's like a panel.

959
01:06:29,676 --> 01:06:46,870
Scott: but you know during a panel usually if you have a video panel Usually showing many short clips with talking in between each one But what you could do is you basically have it be a panel room But it's a panel where you say a little bit and watch a lot of video And say a little bit and watch a lot of video.

960
01:06:47,091 --> 01:06:54,626
Rym: So for example, what if you had a show on your own that was called, you know Anime next steps and the description is basically, you know, you've just gotten into anime.

961
01:06:54,646 --> 01:06:55,689
Rym: You don't know a lot about it.

962
01:06:56,412 --> 01:07:01,029
Rym: What is out there and what it would be is you have an mc and you show like?

963
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:05,172
Rym: Six different shows the first episode of each one From like.

964
01:07:05,233 --> 01:07:15,306
Rym: six different like the heavy hitters from six different genres of anime show like the definitive robot show Show the first episode of evangelion show the first episode of cowboy bebop.

965
01:07:15,707 --> 01:07:25,629
Rym: and you know Talk a little bit about each one between them and have it be an extended panel where you're explaining anime you're showing anime You're getting people excited about anime.

966
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:31,368
Rym: It's a. it's a format that i've never seen anywhere and I think otakon is the kind that could pull it off.

967
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:32,810
Scott: Yep anyway.

968
01:07:34,212 --> 01:07:34,695
Scott: So yeah, there was.

969
01:07:34,735 --> 01:07:41,570
Scott: there was a little problem lining up for things in advance But there's really not a solution to that other than have a lot more things going on.

970
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:43,657
Rym: And just to understand the scale of this.

971
01:07:43,778 --> 01:07:46,527
Rym: and at otakon it wasn't just these crazy big events.

972
01:07:46,869 --> 01:07:55,530
Rym: our anime You should see panel not only had a line out the door too big But they actually came in and for fire code reasons kicked a whole ton of people out before we started.

973
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,922
Scott: Yeah, because the panel before us is standing room only.

974
01:07:57,962 --> 01:08:00,862
Scott: but they decided you know No one's allowed to sit on the floor.

975
01:08:00,923 --> 01:08:01,710
Scott: No one's allowed to stand.

976
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:02,997
Scott: It's once all the chairs are filled.

977
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:03,399
Scott: That's it.

978
01:08:03,459 --> 01:08:03,982
Scott: Everyone out.

979
01:08:04,545 --> 01:08:08,650
Rym: But yeah, I mean overall This was a fantastic otakon for the fans.

980
01:08:08,776 --> 01:08:17,084
Rym: I mean There was always something to do and a lot of times i'd be at an anime con especially even older otakons And at a certain time be like i'm bored.

981
01:08:17,144 --> 01:08:18,250
Rym: Let's see what there is to do.

982
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:19,558
Rym: And I wouldn't really be excited about.

983
01:08:19,578 --> 01:08:25,830
Scott: last year at otakon the previous one There were definitely long swatches of time where it felt like uh, what do I do?

984
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:31,379
Scott: And I sat in the artist's alley bored at the you know The table doing my fanboy feud survey.

985
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:34,470
Scott: I would go to the dealer's room multiple times this otakon.

986
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:43,430
Scott: I was only able to make it into the dealer's room once on saturday for like an hour And I was always worrying about the time of the next event that I had to get to at a certain time.

987
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:51,874
Rym: I mean if I went through the schedule there was something that I would like to do at every point throughout this con pretty much And I mean what else.

988
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:56,395
Rym: the video game room was as always gigantic and a lot of people were in there And there were a lot of good games.

989
01:08:56,455 --> 01:08:59,490
Rym: and I always like otakon's video game room because it's actually kind of chill.

990
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:00,649
Rym: It's a good place to go and relax.

991
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:09,049
Scott: They have a lot of shoot-em-ups and a lot of good ones and they had the witch one again the versus which one And they have a lot of just kind of weird japanese games and they have.

992
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:12,523
Rym: you know They run the tournaments and all that stuff, but it's a really chill place to hang out.

993
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:15,435
Rym: I like it and uh The lark was crazy as always.

994
01:09:15,456 --> 01:09:16,500
Rym: there were a lot of people in there.

995
01:09:17,022 --> 01:09:18,790
Rym: otakon was rocking as always.

996
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:23,390
Scott: Yeah, I never actually went into otakon before which is basically the otakon daycare.

997
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:27,429
Scott: It's a place you can bring your kids, you know little kids at otakon to give them something to do.

998
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:30,319
Scott: That room is actually rocking in there.

999
01:09:30,341 --> 01:09:32,970
Scott: There's all sorts of arts and crafts going on There's.

1000
01:09:33,171 --> 01:09:36,122
Scott: they got a little, you know kids anime showing on the screen.

1001
01:09:36,624 --> 01:09:38,050
Scott: It is totally awesome in there.

1002
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:40,456
Scott: I mean It is worth the price.

1003
01:09:40,475 --> 01:09:43,046
Scott: just to if you have little kids just bring them to otakon.

1004
01:09:43,106 --> 01:09:44,250
Scott: forget about the rest of otakon.

1005
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:48,010
Scott: Just bring your kids to otachan and it's like totally awesome weekend daycare.

1006
01:09:49,091 --> 01:09:59,511
Rym: And I mean I was told that like all the events I didn't get a chance to go to, you know we kind of sent people out and they they really had a good time, uh, really of note, I do have to say something about the Animation.

1007
01:09:59,873 --> 01:10:04,170
Rym: we've talked about it before but you know, we actually saw the otakon opening animation.

1008
01:10:04,271 --> 01:10:04,815
Rym: They showed it.

1009
01:10:05,177 --> 01:10:11,809
Rym: they were actually as we found out later Contractually obligated to show it no more than once or any given day.

1010
01:10:11,829 --> 01:10:19,078
Scott: Yeah So the way it works is jim vowels and you know otakon Teamed up with madhouse the japanese animation studio.

1011
01:10:19,098 --> 01:10:22,107
Rym: jim is credited in the animation as producer.

1012
01:10:22,127 --> 01:10:23,732
Rym: That is so cool That's pretty cool.

1013
01:10:23,832 --> 01:10:34,630
Scott: And they are um, you know madhouse is really buddy buddy with otakon muriyama The guy that basically the head of madhouse dude is always at otakon always being awesome.

1014
01:10:34,811 --> 01:10:36,900
Scott: He had a couple panels, you know hanging out.

1015
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:38,667
Scott: He loves otakon that guy.

1016
01:10:39,089 --> 01:10:42,784
Scott: and You know, they teamed up and they made this short animation.

1017
01:10:42,824 --> 01:10:44,250
Scott: It was maybe a minute or two long.

1018
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,285
Rym: It was basically if otakon were in anime, this is the opener.

1019
01:10:47,466 --> 01:10:50,530
Scott: Yes, and They played it at the opening ceremonies.

1020
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:55,030
Scott: They played it at the cosplay the masquerade and they played it at the closing ceremonies.

1021
01:10:55,392 --> 01:10:58,710
Rym: And well, we actually weren't going to make it to the opening ceremony.

1022
01:10:58,750 --> 01:10:59,673
Rym: So we had a panel to run.

1023
01:11:00,014 --> 01:11:09,498
Rym: so we sent emily to cover it for us and she came back just bubbling about how great it was and actually Opening ceremonies partly because of that animation.

1024
01:11:09,538 --> 01:11:12,850
Rym: but from what she said otakon really stepped up the opening ceremony.

1025
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:16,542
Scott: Yeah opening ceremonies the most anime conventions is lame.

1026
01:11:16,603 --> 01:11:20,696
Scott: It's basically like hey, we're having a con And everyone goes in.

1027
01:11:20,716 --> 01:11:22,343
Rym: I mean basically anyone there.

1028
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:30,909
Rym: until this otakon The only con I had been to that had a really good opening ceremonies was like one of the two anime centrals I attended a long time ago.

1029
01:11:31,191 --> 01:11:31,872
Rym: Yeah, it was just.

1030
01:11:32,053 --> 01:11:34,700
Rym: they're always kind of weak, but it was a great opening.

1031
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:43,329
Rym: and then they showed the animation and that animation It did not just meet expectations it exceeded them to a degree that I could not believe.

1032
01:11:43,369 --> 01:11:46,278
Rym: yeah It was full of inside jokes.

1033
01:11:46,499 --> 01:11:50,010
Rym: the the level of homage in there was epic.

1034
01:11:50,652 --> 01:12:02,549
Scott: I mean when the manhole covers start flying across the screen to destroy the eva and only someone who was at the otakon Which is the year all the manhole covers in the city exploded would know would get the joke.

1035
01:12:03,191 --> 01:12:08,730
Rym: It was it was it was clearly made with with all the love and dedication it was.

1036
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:15,810
Rym: Otakon is clearly the best american anime convention and there is nothing you could say to change my mind on that.

1037
01:12:16,233 --> 01:12:18,428
Rym: And this is just the solid proof of that.

1038
01:12:19,632 --> 01:12:24,010
Rym: So if you can find it somewhere to see it, yeah animax, but where's your opening animation?

1039
01:12:24,651 --> 01:12:25,153
Scott: You got nothing.

1040
01:12:25,454 --> 01:12:29,690
Rym: I'm sure there will be a way if you did not see it to see it someday.

1041
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:41,327
Rym: Because if if no other way at the next otakon it is so worth seeing it is worth going out of your way to see Especially these two minutes of animation because it's really well animated.

1042
01:12:41,507 --> 01:12:48,258
Rym: and I mean It's not just so much to otakon the things the references They I can't even I don't even want to get into it.

1043
01:12:48,298 --> 01:12:51,148
Rym: There's so much in there and that's such a short span of time.

1044
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:54,420
Rym: Yep but also I mean briefly otakon.

1045
01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:01,877
Rym: as always they're running the masquerade in the Arena next door, which is great because you know, we talk about lines at otakon.

1046
01:13:01,897 --> 01:13:07,939
Rym: but otakon has solved the one of the biggest problems of cons, which is What do you do with the masquerade line?

1047
01:13:07,979 --> 01:13:10,530
Rym: because at most cons the masquerade cannot seat?

1048
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:15,670
Rym: Everyone in the con who wants to see it and the line will be forever and it's crazy and horrible.

1049
01:13:16,093 --> 01:13:20,007
Rym: And people basically had to give up their entire saturday to attend at otakon.

1050
01:13:20,991 --> 01:13:26,478
Rym: You can see like 30 000 people in that arena And it was like there were a lot.

1051
01:13:26,498 --> 01:13:32,129
Rym: there were at least 10 000 people in there during the masquerade by my rough Count and you can just walk in and out.

1052
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:33,618
Rym: You might not.

1053
01:13:33,638 --> 01:13:48,997
Rym: I mean you have to wait in line if you want to sit in front But you don't need to because the masquerade if you've never been to an otakon This is pretty much the best masquerade you're going to see because one they have a full three camera camera crew live And giant jumbotron screens everywhere.

1054
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:53,710
Rym: So they have real professional cameramen doing a real professional job.

1055
01:13:54,233 --> 01:13:57,410
Rym: Even you're sitting in the back watching the cosplay is amazing.

1056
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:03,109
Rym: Yeah, if you're into that sort of thing and two I walked in and I watched five skits.

1057
01:14:04,031 --> 01:14:07,030
Rym: They were all actually really funny and well put together.

1058
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:12,010
Rym: The thing is they were all basically musical numbers like choreographed dance and music.

1059
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:20,362
Scott: Yeah, because I mean doing the the the the spoken word sort of voice Talking and things because they make you they don't let you talk into microphones.

1060
01:14:20,402 --> 01:14:22,690
Scott: They make you pre-record all your audio.

1061
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:28,210
Scott: So if it's talking and you're going to lip sync the talking it always comes off sort of bleh.

1062
01:14:28,893 --> 01:14:38,250
Rym: See the thing is I actually saw one group that they did that first and then it was the song and dance number And it worked really really well that I I mean I didn't stay through the whole thing.

1063
01:14:38,331 --> 01:14:46,790
Rym: I can't say how good it all was but the ones I saw Were actually good and I wouldn't have I was actually If I didn't have things to do I kind of wanted to hang out in there and watch a bunch more.

1064
01:14:47,012 --> 01:14:48,384
Scott: Yeah, I still do.

1065
01:14:48,505 --> 01:15:08,790
Scott: I miss Sort of the old otakon of three or four years ago where I would sit and watch the last hour of the cosplay on the simulcast video screen not in the masquerade room, but in another room just watching it on video and Then as soon as it was over the horribly violent movies would come on on the very same screen.

1066
01:15:09,193 --> 01:15:11,310
Scott: That I just love that and I sort of miss it.

1067
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:12,473
Rym: But think about otakon.

1068
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:13,676
Rym: what this says about otakon?

1069
01:15:14,137 --> 01:15:15,681
Rym: every other con they have their cosplay.

1070
01:15:16,002 --> 01:15:21,137
Rym: otakon's cosplay is in a 30,000 person arena With a real professional camera crew.

1071
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:21,679
Rym: Yep.

1072
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,850
Rym: It is if you're a cosplayer that is the place to be.

1073
01:15:25,571 --> 01:15:30,489
Scott: Another thing that was done professionally at least from what I heard I didn't actually go to it was the otakon game show.

1074
01:15:30,529 --> 01:15:39,902
Scott: now otakon never lets us do our match game because they have the official game show and they do pre-screening forward and the whole thing and basically It's jeopardy but with a twist of some kind

1075
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:46,370
Rym: and the key is Super professionalism coupled with the fact that they screen the people before they let them in the contest.

1076
01:15:46,853 --> 01:15:57,809
Scott: They also apparently have really like they have wicked high technology like using wiimotes to buzz in and It's totally off the wall in terms of the production quality of the show.

1077
01:15:58,393 --> 01:16:01,390
Scott: So it's tough for us to compete with that with our little match game.

1078
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:03,741
Rym: See the thing is though the match game doesn't need the high technology.

1079
01:16:03,841 --> 01:16:05,207
Rym: All it needs is the star power.

1080
01:16:05,288 --> 01:16:08,360
Rym: That's right Of course, it also requires the stars.

1081
01:16:08,421 --> 01:16:10,630
Rym: Thank you ConnectiCon for not providing it.

1082
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:18,109
Rym: Oh All right, oh well, but yeah, you'll be seeing our match game at every other convention this year.

1083
01:16:19,212 --> 01:16:19,855
Rym: I think I don't know.

1084
01:16:19,896 --> 01:16:21,565
Rym: I think we're running at the new york anime festival.

1085
01:16:21,585 --> 01:16:22,510
Rym: Not a hundred percent sure.

1086
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:24,177
Rym: I gotta actually look at that schedule.

1087
01:16:24,217 --> 01:16:24,719
Rym: It's coming up.

1088
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:24,960
Scott: Yep.

1089
01:16:25,402 --> 01:16:27,370
Rym: But yeah, I mean otakon was fantastic.

1090
01:16:27,811 --> 01:16:28,794
Rym: Everything went smoothly.

1091
01:16:28,814 --> 01:16:34,670
Rym: if you went to the con feedback session, there were really practically zero legitimate complaints.

1092
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:37,843
Scott: Yeah, there were some people complaining that the masquerade went long.

1093
01:16:37,863 --> 01:16:39,148
Scott: It was pretty long.

1094
01:16:39,168 --> 01:16:43,850
Rym: last year They complained that it went short and otakon knows they're trying to figure out exactly how to make it the right length.

1095
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,199
Scott: Yeah, it pretty much, you know, there's too many factors in there.

1096
01:16:46,219 --> 01:16:47,263
Scott: You can't account for everything.

1097
01:16:47,303 --> 01:16:47,865
Scott: It's difficult.

1098
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:51,597
Scott: Um, What are the complaints to be here at the feedback session?

1099
01:16:51,757 --> 01:16:53,904
Rym: really nothing that was worth talking about.

1100
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:55,589
Rym: some people complained about dumb things.

1101
01:16:56,331 --> 01:17:01,467
Scott: They there was the complaint about the subtitles being unreadable but to which they basically said duly noted.

1102
01:17:01,487 --> 01:17:02,290
Rym: We'll fix it next year.

1103
01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:03,256
Rym: I mean what more do you want?

1104
01:17:03,599 --> 01:17:07,657
Rym: There was the guy who was like but 4chan 4chan, why can't we come back?

1105
01:17:08,038 --> 01:17:10,083
Rym: and the otakon staff was fantastic.

1106
01:17:10,324 --> 01:17:18,169
Scott: Oh, there was a complaint about the um, The wristbands, right and as soon as he got up there and he's like, yeah, maybe we should just idea that a boo.

1107
01:17:19,195 --> 01:17:19,609
Scott: I love it.

1108
01:17:19,811 --> 01:17:22,123
Scott: That's the one thing I love about the otakon feedback panel.

1109
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:27,821
Scott: if you go up there And you complain about something stupid and you're wrong, right?

1110
01:17:28,022 --> 01:17:31,110
Scott: The whole audience will boo you like you're wrong.

1111
01:17:32,433 --> 01:17:33,096
Scott: You know where that?

1112
01:17:33,116 --> 01:17:35,768
Rym: oh it was so good when the guy was like you should let 4chan in.

1113
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:50,013
Scott: But Otakon's response is so great like you have to prove to us that you're not gonna be idiots and that's pretty much impossible But even better.

1114
01:17:50,074 --> 01:17:56,340
Rym: actually one guy went up and he asked the question of the staff and his question was What is your favorite anime?

1115
01:17:56,622 --> 01:17:57,406
Rym: and they all answered.

1116
01:17:57,426 --> 01:17:58,069
Rym: and I gotta say?

1117
01:17:58,552 --> 01:18:02,390
Rym: The otakon staff like the head staff have some classy taste in anime.

1118
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,619
Scott: Yeah, and one guy even said I can.

1119
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:09,063
Scott: he said the otakon opening animation Which is perfectly okay?

1120
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:14,725
Rym: But before we stop I mean otakon was great, but i'd love to.

1121
01:18:14,825 --> 01:18:16,010
Rym: i'd love to give you guys a little insight.

1122
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:28,078
Rym: I'd like to talk a little bit of meta because you know most cons we get the press badge or we don't kind of willy-nilly but Unlike any other con otakon is a convention where if we want to cover the convention We want to see all the events.

1123
01:18:28,118 --> 01:18:29,710
Rym: We want to kind of get the feel of everything.

1124
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:35,030
Rym: We actually do need the press pass because otherwise we can't get into the events without lining up for an hour.

1125
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:36,096
Rym: I mean katsu kana.

1126
01:18:36,137 --> 01:18:38,410
Rym: I just kind of walk into everything and amazement.

1127
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:39,675
Rym: I just kind of walked into everything.

1128
01:18:39,695 --> 01:18:43,650
Rym: but otakon the press badge actually gets you everything you need.

1129
01:18:43,971 --> 01:18:46,479
Scott: Yeah, but we didn't do a lot of the stuff it gets you like.

1130
01:18:46,539 --> 01:18:50,050
Scott: it gets you like interviews in quiet rooms with guests.

1131
01:18:50,575 --> 01:18:51,626
Scott: We didn't do any of that.

1132
01:18:52,056 --> 01:18:53,394
Scott: All right We didn't want to do that.

1133
01:18:53,414 --> 01:18:59,679
Rym: but luckily if you want all that press coverage our dear friends in anime world order They kind of covered the other half of press.

1134
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,904
Rym: They got all the interviews.

1135
01:19:01,205 --> 01:19:02,310
Rym: They did all that sort of stuff.

1136
01:19:02,592 --> 01:19:08,450
Rym: we kind of went around and got the fans perspective, but For the first time I actually went in, you know, I did the paperwork.

1137
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:14,490
Rym: We got the press badges walking it out and I got to say otakon is so professional when it comes to the press.

1138
01:19:14,911 --> 01:19:19,650
Rym: They it was better than the freaking new york anime festival, which is a professional for-profit con.

1139
01:19:20,731 --> 01:19:21,835
Scott: Yeah, it was good times.

1140
01:19:21,895 --> 01:19:24,705
Rym: I mean i'm holding the press kit they gave us and it was.

1141
01:19:24,966 --> 01:19:26,030
Rym: it was perfectly put together.

1142
01:19:26,351 --> 01:19:35,763
Rym: They gave us these really really nice little press notebooks to say otakon 2008 with like business card holders And pretty much if you wanted that business card holder was real useful.

1143
01:19:35,783 --> 01:19:37,449
Scott: We got a whole bunch of business cards in there.

1144
01:19:38,471 --> 01:19:40,941
Scott: Yeah, well actually they gave us a pen otakon pens.

1145
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:43,390
Scott: We will actually have really suck it up to the press.

1146
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:54,620
Rym: We'll have a lot of kind of tertiary and follow-up otakon coverage In the next several shows as news is as I get to kind of Writing them up and I got to clarify things with otakon, you know I want to talk about something.

1147
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:57,369
Rym: but I want to ask them like well What were the numbers and what were this sort of thing?

1148
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:58,956
Scott: But yeah, we'll also talk about.

1149
01:19:58,996 --> 01:20:01,890
Scott: you know, here's we met so-and-so in the artist alley check out their arts.

1150
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:04,588
Rym: That's the thing and we also will have talk in the future about.

1151
01:20:04,609 --> 01:20:08,968
Rym: you know here's all the actual announcements like this was licensed and that was licensed and all that stuff.

1152
01:20:09,069 --> 01:20:11,639
Rym: but Pretty much otakon was fantastic.

1153
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,770
Rym: It was a great time to be had by all there.

1154
01:20:14,153 --> 01:20:16,370
Rym: I can't think of anything that really really went wrong.

1155
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:17,318
Rym: Nothing affected us.

1156
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:18,670
Rym: Everyone had a great time.

1157
01:20:19,372 --> 01:20:22,049
Rym: I'm kind of tired because the show went on for a long time.

1158
01:20:22,342 --> 01:20:25,653
Scott: Yeah My only real problem with otakon is that it would felt It all.

1159
01:20:25,713 --> 01:20:30,992
Scott: it felt a little bit shorter than other otakons because I was doing stuff the whole time and I didn't You know other.

1160
01:20:31,052 --> 01:20:36,007
Scott: I kind of liked, you know, sort of having more time to go around look at stuff.

1161
01:20:36,027 --> 01:20:36,990
Scott: See what was going on?

1162
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,385
Rym: Oh, no, I kind of had too much good stuff to do.

1163
01:20:39,465 --> 01:20:40,090
Rym: What will I do?

1164
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:40,651
Rym: I was.

1165
01:20:40,812 --> 01:20:46,050
Scott: I really felt like I only experienced a smaller fraction of the con, you know.

1166
01:20:46,431 --> 01:20:53,214
Scott: As opposed to previous years where I felt like I really went around and saw what there was to see this year I felt like I was missing.

1167
01:20:53,234 --> 01:21:02,418
Rym: something does really well is that there's so much good stuff going on at any given moment now That no matter what kind of anime fan you are You'll always have something to do.

1168
01:21:02,679 --> 01:21:04,386
Rym: if you want to watch anime you can watch anime.

1169
01:21:04,607 --> 01:21:05,350
Rym: you want to see a panel?

1170
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:06,949
Rym: There's five of them and they're all great.

1171
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:08,815
Rym: You want to go to a concert?

1172
01:21:08,835 --> 01:21:11,265
Rym: There's a giant concert and then there's another concert missing.

1173
01:21:11,285 --> 01:21:14,300
Scott: the concert was pretty painful But packs is no way.

1174
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,130
Scott: i'm going to see at least one of the two concerts.

1175
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:19,566
Rym: Yeah, but you know that was the price we pay for doing a million panels.

1176
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:24,030
Scott: Yep Oh, well Can we end the show so I can like get a bed or whatever?

1177
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:31,270
Rym: I think we can end it if you guys have any specific questions about otakon other than Kind of the general stuff that we didn't have like an outline prepared and we did the show.

1178
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:33,641
Scott: So we sort of just kept talking and talking and talking partly

1179
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:46,710
Rym: because we're kind of really I mean This is basically the only chance we get to kind of relax and recuperate a little bit before we fly out to packs To do that big panel there and all that business and then right after that we have the new anime festival coming up.

1180
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:52,782
Scott: So right, so if you have a specific question about otakon go to the forums Don't email us.

1181
01:21:52,823 --> 01:21:59,846
Scott: go to the forums And go to the thread for this episode And ask it and then we'll answer it there for everyone to see the answer.

1182
01:22:00,147 --> 01:22:00,910
Rym: or just email us.

1183
01:22:01,172 --> 01:22:09,610
Rym: I mean if you want generic otakon coverage you haven't listened before you could go back and listen to all our other otakon shows because Previous otakon coverages we've talked a lot more about.

1184
01:22:09,992 --> 01:22:18,986
Rym: You know what all the things that otakon is like that We really don't need to talk about again because they're the same every year You know, you go and watch anime and hang out and all that sort of stuff.

1185
01:22:19,328 --> 01:22:21,602
Scott: Yep All right Oh and you can.

1186
01:22:21,825 --> 01:22:26,830
Scott: uh, you know You can find all about the violent movies by go if you want to find out more about the violent movies you watched.

1187
01:22:27,252 --> 01:22:30,990
Scott: Go to the otakon schedule and then go to imdb and put them together.

1188
01:22:31,331 --> 01:22:36,870
Rym: Oh, yeah, and I want to give a big shout out to all the people who were at our panels who actually knew about anime.

1189
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:43,848
Rym: That was real refreshing to to mention an old obscure anime and have half the crowd scream and yell and go.

1190
01:22:43,888 --> 01:22:44,450
Rym: Oh my god.

1191
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:48,049
Scott: Yeah, on the one hand it made it hard to do a panel because the audience knows more than we do.

1192
01:22:48,512 --> 01:22:50,890
Scott: On the other hand it made it awesome because the audience is awesome.

1193
01:22:51,373 --> 01:22:54,050
Rym: Well, the cool thing is we're trying to start this meme.

1194
01:22:54,130 --> 01:23:02,384
Rym: We explain this at every panel how you go to any panel at a con and people say just the name of an anime the crowd goes Whoa Every time they did that we stopped them.

1195
01:23:02,424 --> 01:23:03,310
Rym: We're like, what are you doing?

1196
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:13,344
Rym: And we've been doing this for at ConnectiCon too and it's starting to work a little bit like at uh, otakon By our third or fourth panel people kind of stopped doing it.

1197
01:23:13,786 --> 01:23:14,750
Rym: Yeah, it was amazing.

1198
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:19,127
Rym: Maybe we can change anime culture a little bit making them stop going.

1199
01:23:19,147 --> 01:23:29,341
