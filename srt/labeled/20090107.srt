00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,746
Rym: It's Wednesday, January 7th.

2
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:12,508
Scott: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:13,190
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,837
Rym: And this is GeekNights tonight, K.O.

5
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:16,820
Rym: Century Beast!

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,908
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:37,230
Rym: So at work We kind of through various means ended up acquiring like basically the whole floor that we're on in the building.

8
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:38,862
Scott: Did you have most of the floor ready?

9
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:53,830
Rym: We had a lot of it But now we've got like enough of it to where we're gonna do major construction and because we the whole thing about our office That's cool is that all the walls are glass and there are some people or groups that have I guess separate rooms because you know Various reasons we don't want the thing to be one giant room.

10
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,470
Rym: So we've got glass walls everywhere just to make it still feel open and everyone can kind of see everyone and talk to everyone.

11
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:11,283
Rym: And we have video Conferencing running all the time between all the different offices conference rooms and things and even around the world like every office We've got has 24/7 video conference with like the conference rooms and all the other offices.

12
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:11,945
Scott: Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:18,710
Rym: It's actually really cool, but Now that we've got all this new space that old companies were in we're going all out.

14
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,590
Rym: So we're like knocking down all the walls between all the spaces and replacing it with these other companies have like big offices or what?

15
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,569
Rym: Well between all of them we got a lot of space.

16
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:43,598
Rym: So, you know we got to knock down all the walls and basically they built the new space completely based on all our new designs And everything and now they moved a bunch of people in there And now they got to move people out of the second space that we got a long time ago Into the first space so that we can move people.

17
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:54,349
Rym: basically we're shuffling all around and my department which is only four people Anyway, that's how badass we are got Put into one of the old conference rooms near where we used to be.

18
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:59,530
Rym: So now I effectively have a corner office, but it's on the wrong corner of the building.

19
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,987
Rym: So I basically get to look at the back of Pershing Square and like 41st Street.

20
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:09,430
Scott: Yeah, hey like those there's a lot of like windows depending on which side of the building you're on.

21
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,970
Scott: You could be looking at like an alley or you could be looking at like the water.

22
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,337
Rym: It's like well like some streets.

23
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:16,690
Rym: to like 42nd Street is like a main street.

24
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:23,867
Rym: So if you go to a 33rd Street or 41st Street It's mostly like the backs of big buildings as opposed to the fronts of smaller buildings.

25
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,389
Scott: Yep.

26
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:27,829
Rym: Yep Yep, so it's all like loading docks here working in a conference room.

27
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:30,630
Rym: Well, we turn the conference room into our office.

28
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:32,436
Scott: You brought desks in there.

29
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:33,962
Rym: actually, you know, we got desk.

30
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:34,644
Scott: or did you just have?

31
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:36,350
Scott: are you just sitting around one big table?

32
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:37,697
Rym: You know how we got desks.

33
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,350
Rym: hmm because so many, you know, the economy's bad.

34
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:42,650
Rym: So a lot of other companies aren't doing really well.

35
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,479
Scott: You just took them from the companies moved out the office.

36
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,433
Rym: the building basically said look we own all this stuff down We don't want it.

37
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:51,403
Rym: So anyone who wants it take it.

38
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,394
Rym: So we took it all and we're yeah Why not?

39
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:54,808
Scott: the worst is you can sell it.

40
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:59,970
Rym: So I got this brand new desk and the four of us have this like corner office and we're private from everyone.

41
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,262
Rym: but the problem what I was worried about?

42
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:08,570
Rym: they moved while I was on break and That room Woman space is one cold mother.

43
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:10,779
Rym: That room was so cold.

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,269
Rym: Like it just it was in a freezing room.

45
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:18,610
Rym: So we got boiler heat on the windows that we turn all the way up and it's bearable.

46
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:29,070
Rym: But the only reason it's bearable is not because the room is a comfortable temperature But because the air conditioning from the ceiling is fighting to grim death with the boiler heat from the windows.

47
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,417
Scott: Why is there air conditioning?

48
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:31,000
Scott: that's on.

49
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:32,529
Rym: there's no way to turn it off.

50
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,877
Rym: Really It's an old building now old.

51
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:36,780
Rym: the Lincoln building is.

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,410
Scott: yeah, but I mean usually each floor has like control.

53
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:46,669
Rym: Yes, so we could turn it off thus ruining the entire rest of the floor, which is also all ours and making it too hot.

54
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,495
Scott: You know, that's how it is.

55
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:54,250
Rym: No, so basically we've got this kind of like having to humidifier and a dehumidifier fighting.

56
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:59,966
Rym: Wow, so as a result, there's like this constant whirlwind in the room.

57
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:05,270
Scott: It's better than our office Of a floor but there's one in control for the whole office, right?

58
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,730
Scott: But basically it's a blower into a vent and then you can either get heat or cold out of this vent, right?

59
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,250
Scott: But it's a long event with many openings.

60
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:18,850
Scott: It's like the end of the vent doesn't get blown out very much But the beginning of the vent gets a lot of pressure right because it's one long vent.

61
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:24,911
Scott: So if you sit like the way end of the vent the temperature is totally different than if you sit at the way beginning of The vent.

62
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:32,947
Rym: well, it didn't help that the one of the people in HR didn't like the fact that the vent in their office Which is also being renovated basically points at them from the ceiling.

63
00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:33,750
Scott: Yeah, I hate that too.

64
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,090
Scott: That's it's like you put a desk with a vent blowing at it.

65
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,410
Scott: That's the worst because even if the air conditioner is set just right that person is wicked cold.

66
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:43,224
Rym: Not only that but the contacts dry out apparently.

67
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,189
Scott: Yeah that too.

68
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:49,110
Rym: So she just put a piece of cardboard over it, but that increased the pressure on the rest of the floor.

69
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,542
Rym: We're not allowed to do that.

70
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:58,499
Rym: Yes Let's because I have Two and a half computers under my desk, which are all kind of high-powered.

71
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:05,410
Rym: They're being space heaters and because I'm up against the boiler heat My desk is basically a kotatsu.

72
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:07,836
Rym: It's kind of awesome.

73
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:10,830
Scott: Like I should go buy a kotatsu and bring it over everyone.

74
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:16,390
Rym: But I kind of get like way under my desk in this giant leather chair that I also purloined from failed company.

75
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:17,597
Scott: I don't like leather chairs.

76
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,342
Scott: It's not a fan neither.

77
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:19,529
Rym: Do I but leathers chair?

78
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:23,090
Scott: I guess if I had a leather freedom chair, you know as the material be okay.

79
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,826
Scott: But I'm leather chair like the big cushy executive chairs.

80
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:31,300
Scott: They suck They look impressive, but they don't Better than really cheap office chair.

81
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,022
Scott: That is true.

82
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:32,965
Scott: That is true.

83
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:34,790
Rym: So that's what I got rocking.

84
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,538
Rym: I basically my desk is a kotatsu.

85
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,507
Rym: I keep the Linux box that I don't use on.

86
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:39,050
Scott: apparently.

87
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:43,450
Scott: Did you see there's no law about like the temperature of a workplace?

88
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,506
Scott: So there's a guy who's got like a pizza place and he's keeping it really easily.

89
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:55,070
Scott: turn the heat off Because the employees forgot to turn the heat off one night and so now there's just no heat for the employees and it's freezing cold.

90
00:05:55,393 --> 00:06:05,070
Scott: awesome, yeah, but you know, so It's weird because you go to an office and everyone's always fighting over the temperature in most offices, but there's no law.

91
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:12,261
Scott: They the boss could just say we're turning the heat off tough shit or we're turning the heat all the way up We're gonna melt you all fuckers like in the summer.

92
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:13,387
Scott: The boss could just turn the heat on.

93
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:14,576
Rym: Uh-huh.

94
00:06:14,818 --> 00:06:15,586
Scott: Nothing you can do about it.

95
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,139
Rym: Well, I remember a long time ago with the AC.

96
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:26,210
Rym: we don't have anything important in the building obviously But the AC the supplementary AC to our tiny little like backup server room went out.

97
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,656
Rym: So we just opened the door and it was fine.

98
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:33,370
Scott: Yeah, usually is of course then you're you know, negating the security of the door.

99
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:38,144
Rym: Well the door I can see because the walls are all glass.

100
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:38,966
Scott: All right.

101
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:42,798
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so check this out right check in.

102
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:45,890
Scott: All right, so I go to work this morning, right?

103
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,825
Scott: And first I scrape off my car with the ice.

104
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:50,970
Rym: Oh my god There was like a centimeter and a half of ice on my car.

105
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,129
Rym: I was I. basically I body slammed my door to knock enough ice off to open it.

106
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,277
Scott: Yeah, that wasn't really wasn't necessary.

107
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:01,390
Rym: But I get up hours before you and I body slam was the only way into my car.

108
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,857
Rym: I guess Bellybuster would have done it.

109
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,524
Scott: I go to the choo-choo.

110
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:09,990
Scott: I get on the choo-choo I'm listening to something and sort of nap in a little bit, right?

111
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,861
Scott: And I wake up to get off the choo-choo and you're still not at work.

112
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:18,557
Scott: No, I'm starting to collect my things, you know and My head is not there.

113
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,030
Rym: Did someone steal the head off your head?

114
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:26,150
Scott: I don't know if they took it from my head, but I I didn't even get off the train.

115
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:36,825
Scott: I know I had it on the train for sure because there's no way I would have made it from my car to the train Without Realizing I would have died just without realizing my winter hat was not covering my ears.

116
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:37,427
Rym: It's too cold.

117
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:38,250
Rym: You just wouldn't have made it.

118
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,658
Scott: Oh, I wouldn't I wouldn't wreck.

119
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:41,267
Scott: I would have known that I wasn't wearing it.

120
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,490
Rym: Oh my god I almost didn't make it to the platform today.

121
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,025
Rym: I was running late anyway, cuz I had to body slam my car open and you fell down.

122
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:48,150
Rym: I didn't fall down.

123
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:52,027
Rym: I didn't fall down once but I almost fell down like 15 times.

124
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:55,061
Rym: So and I have the worst thing is I get to the platform.

125
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:56,046
Rym: This guy's like watch the ice.

126
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:56,729
Rym: I'm like, whatever.

127
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:05,266
Rym: Okay And I refuse to slow down because that guy warned me and it was like dignity time.

128
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:06,450
Rym: I don't need your warning.

129
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,739
Scott: Yeah, I wore my boots today said I'm a problem.

130
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,663
Scott: But I was.

131
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,130
Scott: you know, I looked under the.

132
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,482
Scott: I looked above the seat.

133
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:14,950
Scott: I looked in the adjacent seats.

134
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:22,589
Scott: I looked above below around everywhere on the whole car and you know, the doors are gonna close and my hat was not there.

135
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:26,965
Scott: Someone must have taken it either from me or from my.

136
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:29,154
Scott: I don't know where they took it But it's it wasn't there.

137
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:30,157
Scott: So someone took it.

138
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,260
Rym: I don't know.

139
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:34,350
Rym: I'm I'm leery of thinking that someone stole.

140
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,979
Scott: I don't know they stole it, but they might have taken it.

141
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,323
Rym: But why?

142
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,030
Scott: maybe it was like attached to them.

143
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,797
Scott: I mean it is wool.

144
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:42,229
Scott: It could have been a static cling deal.

145
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,070
Rym: What so some like fat lady gets to work and she's got like four people's hats stuck to her gigantic gargantuan body.

146
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:48,698
Rym: I mean why?

147
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:55,010
Scott: oh maybe you know It was just on the seat next to me and someone you know sat on it and maybe it got into their bag somehow.

148
00:08:55,994 --> 00:09:00,409
Scott: How could that possibly have the same way that a bundle of wires gets tied up and knots on its own?

149
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:03,990
Rym: You put yeah, we've identified that first hand.

150
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:09,470
Rym: You know, we're gonna make a YouTube video of just a webcam of like Christmas lights in the closet.

151
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:11,389
Scott: Yeah, just roll them up real nice.

152
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,520
Scott: Put them in the closet put a camera on there and just watch them.

153
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,868
Scott: time, you know, do a stop-motion time-lapse.

154
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:20,650
Rym: I think the real issue is you have more than one kind of cable together.

155
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:24,210
Rym: Like I had a bunch of like pay-to-cables and a bunch of like USB and shit together.

156
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:29,627
Rym: But I put one of my old scuzzy cables in there and like the next day those cables were done.

157
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:32,010
Scott: That sucks They're still tangled anyway.

158
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:33,898
Scott: So my hats gone.

159
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,890
Rym: Well, do you have another hat?

160
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,874
Scott: Yeah, but it kind of sucks.

161
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,039
Scott: That's why I bought that newer one.

162
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,967
Rym: You wanna I got a backup hat.

163
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:41,670
Rym: It's terrible.

164
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,585
Rym: No, it's my backup ski hat.

165
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:50,946
Scott: I think Dollar, I think if the if the Giants wins on Sunday, maybe I'll buy a Giants head.

166
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:52,772
Rym: Giants head Why not?

167
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:54,117
Rym: I don't know Sam.

168
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:59,758
Rym: by some anime head by like a Gurren Lagann kind of head It's not gonna have with ears coming out of it.

169
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:03,110
Rym: I can maybe a big square print of a character's face.

170
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:14,190
Scott: So also right You know work we did the secret Santa thing All right, and I bought chocolate because I decided I was you got to do something clever like when I worked at IBM.

171
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,467
Scott: No one did anything clever because everyone clever was laid off.

172
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:29,170
Rym: Remember at IBM when I basically had a package full of liquor bottles But when they opened it all the liquor bottles were empty other than water and there was actually a bunch of anime DVDs in there.

173
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:34,603
Rym: Well, I just mean or the Unix an who gave a copy of the Star Wars Christmas special.

174
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:35,866
Scott: That's a good game.

175
00:10:35,906 --> 00:10:41,643
Scott: But no so Someone got me a typical Best Buy gift card, right?

176
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:43,470
Scott: So I'm just like ah fuck, right?

177
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,608
Scott: What am I supposed to buy with this?

178
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,663
Scott: So I went to the Best Buy website and just sort of loached for like.

179
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:50,753
Scott: the first thing to buy and I bought this.

180
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:54,830
Scott: there was a DS game for learning Japanese and the thing was the only one.

181
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:57,910
Rym: So that's what that game was you opened yesterday.

182
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:03,349
Scott: So is it's like my Japanese coach is actually made by Ubisoft, which is a real game currently.

183
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:04,982
Scott: Yeah Well, it's published by Ubisoft.

184
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:07,756
Scott: It's made by Scanning something something.

185
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:08,077
Scott: I don't know.

186
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,040
Scott: So I tried it out and It's terrible, it's good and bad at the same time.

187
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,162
Rym: not learning Japanese.

188
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:18,308
Scott: I'm learning more than none.

189
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:20,890
Rym: Can you say You are shocked?

190
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:28,695
Rym: Can you say my name is Scott Boku?

191
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:30,425
Scott: I don't have to say name Boku.

192
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:32,353
Rym: No, not my Something.

193
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:32,774
Scott: so yeah.

194
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:34,619
Rym: No, but mostly say like Boku.

195
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:41,918
Scott: Ah, I guess yeah, I know it taught me why and it didn't teach me What part of speech is why it's.

196
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:45,168
Rym: it's like something that doesn't exist in English, yeah, it's like a.

197
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:54,249
Scott: It's sort of like an article but not you put it after the subject and before the whatever, okay Yeah, but no I so I'm doing.

198
00:11:55,572 --> 00:12:06,930
Scott: I'm doing like the hiragata stuff right and it's like it shows you wanted It's like this is ah, and then it's like this is a Right, so I'm looking at him real careful like, you know.

199
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:11,150
Scott: And then it's like, okay, and then it gives you an ah, and it says trace this.

200
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:13,049
Scott: So I'm tracing it with the stylus, right?

201
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:15,662
Scott: And I'm like a high traced it with the stylus.

202
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:25,692
Scott: and then when you trace it with the stylus It says ah, and then you and then it fades to gray and it says trace it again And then it's white and it says, you know trace it again Right.

203
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:28,610
Scott: So I do it three times and I'm like, okay all good, right?

204
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:38,210
Scott: Then you know it comes up and you go read a little bit more the lesson and then it's like, okay Here's a blank square draw ah, and it's like oh fuck.

205
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:45,389
Scott: Because when you're tracing it three times in a row you're just doing you know You do it you do it and then you do it one more time.

206
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:53,670
Rym: But if they just give you a blank slate and they're like, ah, it's like oh, yeah Yeah, I remember when I was I got to start practicing again, especially if Emily and I are gonna go to Japan.

207
00:12:54,011 --> 00:13:01,889
Rym: I got about halfway through learning my hiragata, but I got to a point where I could read it pretty quickly But I had a lot of trouble writing it.

208
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:06,450
Scott: Yeah, writing it and the worst part right is that this thing's complex thing I ever wrote was Gankutsu.

209
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:12,710
Scott: Oh, yeah, the thing will teach you like, okay, here are all the tea ones like, you know, tate to date, right?

210
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,803
Scott: I'll tell you today, too Yeah, but then it's like if you put the little quotation mark, it turns his daddy.

211
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,168
Rym: do they do know doesn't it?

212
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:18,389
Scott: do G?

213
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,608
Scott: I forget which one turns to G. I don't know tie goes to da anyway, right?

214
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:25,294
Scott: It's like it's.

215
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,490
Scott: it just tells you that like on one sentence.

216
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,325
Scott: It's like oh, yeah By the way, if you put the quotation mark, it changes them all to the other letter.

217
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,410
Rym: that makes it really easy.

218
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:35,500
Scott: It does make it easy, but you never practice.

219
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,989
Scott: It never does the practice test things with that other letter So you don't actually like learn them.

220
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:47,990
Scott: And then it's like when you're when you're doing the practice things like the letters real big like it takes up almost the whole screen.

221
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:54,130
Scott: But when you've got like the smaller font size, you can barely see if that little quotation mark is there or not.

222
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:56,649
Scott: So it's it's a little bit rough.

223
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:09,030
Scott: It's sort of like it feels like someone sort of just threw it together rather than actually, you know scientifically and using education Knowledges to make something that is easy to learn.

224
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,790
Rym: Maybe we should go with the the you know Expensive lazy option and just buy one of those Rosetta's no stone things.

225
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,254
Rym: The thing

226
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:28,789
Scott: is the way the Rosetta stone thing works at least from what I heard and what I saw a guy using it on the train to learn Hebrew right is it gives you Like all these pictures and then it gives you the word and you got to click on the right picture That goes with the word or vice-versa.

227
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:31,580
Scott: It sort of works like that from what I saw.

228
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,323
Rym: I don't like that.

229
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:38,745
Scott: Okay, so I don't know if that's worth Whatever they charge for the stupid Rosetta stone.

230
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,343
Scott: This was $30.

231
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:44,058
Rym: so Yeah, all right.

232
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:44,943
Rym: Maybe I'll try it out.

233
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:46,150
Rym: Yeah, I want to see this thing.

234
00:14:46,295 --> 00:15:02,610
Scott: Yeah The thing is that does have like a lot like if you actually go through with this thing It might not be like the best at learning and you might have to just sort of you know Force yourself to do a lot of the stuff that you know, it doesn't help you out with but eventually it teaches like a whole shit.

235
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,610
Scott: Ton of kanji are in that little DS cartridge apparently.

236
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:12,121
Rym: So anyway, there is actually some anime news here And I actually want to talk about it because I didn't notice that.

237
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:17,520
Rym: I didn't know there were rumors about this Until I saw rumors confirmed.

238
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:20,270
Scott: That's cuz we don't read like anime forums and shit.

239
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:34,410
Rym: Well, pretty much if anime news network is the AP wire Here I go, yeah, but turns out Koji Masanari who was the director of One of my favorite shows ever read or die the OAV that not the TV the manga?

240
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,699
Rym: Well, no, he I think he also directed the TV.

241
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:39,269
Rym: Okay, but I can't really blame him for that.

242
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,478
Rym: Anyway, read or die.

243
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:46,235
Rym: if you have not seen the read or die OAV Three episode OAV.

244
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,822
Rym: right the title tells you what it's about.

245
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:49,067
Rym: read or die.

246
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,438
Scott: Then should we should name our book club?

247
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,661
Rym: that I think we should.

248
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:54,424
Rym: it is so.

249
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,947
Rym: so it has been said and so it shall be done.

250
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:03,990
Rym: Read or die is one of the most epically full of win things ever made the OAV at least.

251
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:07,850
Rym: Yes, it is epic in a way that is hard to describe.

252
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:14,149
Rym: It is a show where a character will create a gigantic paper airplane and then you will all write it.

253
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:19,339
Rym: But yet it is neither Comical nor undramatic that this has happened.

254
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,705
Rym: And in fact instead of thinking what the fuck you're thinking.

255
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,488
Rym: Oh my god Is that awesome?

256
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:30,409
Scott: Meanwhile, they're fighting against you know, freaking like Goku on his cloud with an extending stick.

257
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:37,982
Rym: But anyway Apparently he is making his first feature film.

258
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,510
Rym: It is going to be called the space show.

259
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:42,450
Scott: Sounds good to me now.

260
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:49,150
Rym: That's the kind of title that leads me to believe it'll be similar to read or die in terms of how awesome it is.

261
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:49,956
Scott: I hope so.

262
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:51,024
Rym: I really hope so.

263
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:51,609
Rym: I don't know.

264
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:56,730
Scott: Anyway, there aren't a lot of anime full-length features these days anyway.

265
00:16:56,851 --> 00:17:00,190
Scott: So anyone that you know, like it anyone at all?

266
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,439
Scott: I'll take what I can get as long as it's not like another Pokemon movie.

267
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,261
Rym: Yeah.

268
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:14,650
Rym: Oh, he did do a read or die TV And he did storyboards for bunt openers and enders and I that's not so bad and he produced it.

269
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,219
Scott: He's fully responsible for the travesty.

270
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,127
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time it Probably made money.

271
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:23,814
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

272
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:25,662
Rym: I watched it all the way through really.

273
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:27,147
Rym: I was living alone.

274
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:27,429
Rym: I'd nothing.

275
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:28,954
Rym: I also.

276
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:34,995
Rym: that was the era of my life when I didn't even have internet access or a cell phone that worked because I lived on that mountain.

277
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:39,178
Rym: I watched a Gunslinger girls at about the same time.

278
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:41,185
Scott: Did they have cable television up there?

279
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:42,067
Scott: No satellite?

280
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,250
Rym: not well We didn't have satellite at the house, but you couldn't get cable even if you wanted to buy.

281
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,684
Rym: I was renting some rich lady's house and she was never there.

282
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:51,290
Rym: So it was basically her house.

283
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:53,730
Rym: I watched every DVD she owned which wasn't that many.

284
00:17:56,234 --> 00:18:01,421
Scott: If only I had Netflix in those days, I know oh My god that said the DVD bag.

285
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:13,430
Rym: like all three back every day I would drive a half-hour down the mountain and park at this elementary school and sit in the parking lot on the top of The slide where I got cell service and call people in my boredom.

286
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:22,210
Rym: So yes, I watched all of read or die TV and all of gunslinger girls And if only you had had like, you know, something like coke don't okay in those days.

287
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:24,249
Rym: Oh my god You realize during that time?

288
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:30,708
Rym: That is when I got all s ranks on everything I could in both of the original GBA advanced wars.

289
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:35,320
Scott: All right Anyway So, you know Hatsune Miku, right?

290
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:46,963
Rym: In fact because of Emily I've got the Hatsune Miku mixing box including the DVD and the chibi little PVC staring what's on the DVD bunch of stuff.

291
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,730
Rym: I haven't really fully explored explored it yet.

292
00:18:49,011 --> 00:19:00,290
Scott: It's not the software so don't think that yeah, but basically I found out Basically from this anime news network article that there are things I didn't know right this yo Yamaha's Vocaloid software engine, right?

293
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:06,009
Scott: And that's the thing that lets you do this sort of typing lyrics and notes and making someone sing it.

294
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:15,636
Scott: but This other company Krypton right is basically what they do is they make sort of like voice samples for Vocaloid.

295
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:31,545
Scott: so it's not Yamaha that's doing these character things it's Krypton is making these character things that you sort of put into Vocaloid so that you you know and You know they get sort of like famous people to are very talented people to do them like.

296
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:36,770
Scott: there's a there's a gak poid I think it says here right, you know done by gak and whatever.

297
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:43,367
Scott: so They got There's a new character for their new one, right?

298
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,090
Scott: So this is the third one because it was Hatsune Miku then it was those twins, right?

299
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,898
Scott: And now it's the third one.

300
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:54,534
Scott: The third one is named Megarin Luca.

301
00:19:56,316 --> 00:20:04,330
Scott: She doesn't look as hot as Hatsune Miku as far as I'm concerned but She is done by Yuu Asakawa.

302
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:16,863
Scott: They had her do the voicing for it and there's a couple demo songs You can listen to like Amazing Grace and some other song and it sounds okay But it still sounds like Vocaloid, you know, it's.

303
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:23,230
Scott: it is what it is And I'm sure that if people like this character, they'll be flood of internet stuff.

304
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:27,283
Scott: Really I think the problem with this character at least that is the visit.

305
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:29,392
Scott: the graphical design of it Is.

306
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:40,070
Scott: it's more like a Square Enix character where there's a lot of stuff on her, you know It's like she's got the boots with a lot of laces and then a sock leg thingy and then a you know an armband.

307
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,818
Rym: Miku isn't super complex.

308
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:48,140
Rym: She's got what the tie and the long sleeves and the big hair Yeah, it's mostly the tie is like the only real accessory.

309
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,950
Scott: This girl's got like two belts and a bunch of neck shit.

310
00:20:52,675 --> 00:21:00,247
Scott: No one should have that many belts Yeah, but yeah, I guess we'll see if this character becomes as popular as Hatsune Miku.

311
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:05,569
Scott: I doubt it, but Maybe I maybe people would be able to make like better music with her voice.

312
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:10,788
Rym: I don't really want to go through it all because if you care, you'll just go to a website and read the list.

313
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:16,743
Rym: but The the anime industry is recovering from the I guess crash it had earlier.

314
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:19,150
Scott: Well, no, it's not the industry's not recovering.

315
00:21:19,672 --> 00:21:22,907
Rym: The industry is consolidating which is the closest thing to recovering.

316
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:26,457
Scott: we're gonna see So more like spoils of war.

317
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:33,843
Rym: so a lot of good titles that got lost You know genie on titles are being picked back up mostly by one funimation.

318
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:35,970
Scott: Yeah, but funimation just had big layoffs.

319
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,350
Rym: Well that think about it lay a bunch of people off, right?

320
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:52,698
Rym: So now I have a lot fewer people to pay, you know, really contract my operations Pick up a whole bunch of already put together titles and just re-release them in thin packs super cheap to build capital and wait out the bad times.

321
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:58,223
Scott: Oh Wait, it says they laid off at least two people from funimation North America.

322
00:21:58,243 --> 00:22:00,008
Rym: That was probably like 60% of their staff.

323
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:02,315
Scott: Yeah, it says last.

324
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,141
Scott: it says a while ago in July.

325
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,685
Scott: They cut staff by 10%.

326
00:22:05,685 --> 00:22:07,170
Scott: so now they got two more people.

327
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:12,888
Rym: Oh, I totally didn't realize that Koji Masunari was the director for the miko 2010 anime.

328
00:22:14,452 --> 00:22:17,221
Scott: Oh, dude, miko 2010 is like the wind miko 2010.

329
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:18,705
Scott: It's not the manga though.

330
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:27,018
Scott: No the manga porn porn but the anime Hilarious not poor god.

331
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,609
Rym: We watched that when we were freshmen at RIT.

332
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:41,142
Scott: It's basically a story about a sex bot that gets a job at working at a radio station as like you know the host of a talk show but in The manga she's a sex bot and she's sexting it up.

333
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:45,187
Scott: But in the in the show She's a sex bot but she never sexes it up.

334
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,434
Scott: So it's it's just that comedy.

335
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:55,038
Rym: Didn't we only get to watch that because the tape Nazi basically translated it himself From the SVHS masters like that.

336
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:59,810
Rym: he got from a friend in Japan and he showed it only to the RIT anime club And he wouldn't give it to anyone.

337
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,473
Scott: Let's see if I can.

338
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:01,457
Scott: I guess I'm gonna have to.

339
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:04,230
Scott: I don't know if it's gonna be available on any bid torrents or anything.

340
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:05,337
Scott: I wonder if any.

341
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,685
Scott: I just looked at a couple.

342
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:07,289
Scott: I didn't see it.

343
00:23:07,591 --> 00:23:09,470
Rym: I'll have to look cuz someone else had to have done it.

344
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,283
Rym: Otherwise we have to track down the tape Nazi and steal his SVHS.

345
00:23:13,544 --> 00:23:14,046
Scott: Yeah, great.

346
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,310
Scott: That's what we need an SVHS.

347
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:17,877
Scott: That'll be real useful.

348
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:22,236
Rym: and I guess one more thing I've got We're not gonna really review it yet.

349
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:32,798
Rym: Obviously because one it deserves a full review - I don't feel like we need to review it before any of you have seen it because the Summed-up review is see it.

350
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:33,881
Rym: It's fantastic.

351
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:44,612
Rym: But Miyazaki's new movie ponyo by the sea We uh, we acquired an advanced copy and we watched it and it is absolutely Amazing.

352
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,836
Rym: like if you didn't like howls.

353
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:50,169
Rym: it kind of goes back to what makes Miyazaki movies.

354
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:52,617
Rym: Awesome It is so awesome.

355
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,905
Rym: Like I I'm not gonna even say anything else.

356
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:56,430
Rym: if you can see it see it.

357
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,570
Rym: It's gonna get a theatrical release in the US.

358
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,949
Rym: So if you live in any major city, you will definitely be able to see it in a theater And it is definitely worth seeing in a theater.

359
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,234
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty good.

360
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:08,763
Scott: But it's not like the most amazing Miyazaki movie ever.

361
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,830
Rym: No, it's not but it's a fantastic movie.

362
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,412
Scott: It's all right.

363
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:12,396
Rym: All right.

364
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:14,565
Rym: Yeah, I would call it fantastic.

365
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,630
Scott: It didn't blow me away.

366
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:17,656
Rym: All right, I would say it was.

367
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:19,902
Rym: I mean it had lots of cubies.

368
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:21,808
Scott: I was better than howls moving castle.

369
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:25,101
Scott: Yeah, sure That's not saying much how.

370
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:25,764
Rym: this was pretty good.

371
00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:31,228
Scott: I think the only problem now I think like howls moving castle like without Calcifer the talking fire.

372
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:31,810
Scott: It had nothing.

373
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:38,969
Rym: I think the problem with howls was that it had too much Unexplained stuff from the book that you wouldn't know what was going on unless you read the book.

374
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,297
Scott: That's true like in Pawnee.

375
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:45,650
Rym: Oh the the few unexplained things don't really matter at all to what you're watching.

376
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:47,839
Scott: I didn't think anything was unexplained.

377
00:24:48,562 --> 00:25:01,841
Scott: I just thought it was sort of it was like Pawnee by the sea was like a shorter story that felt like it was extended with like lots of scenes of you know, just Awesome animations and cool things going on, but you know not.

378
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:02,283
Scott: it was like it.

379
00:25:02,343 --> 00:25:04,529
Scott: the plot was actually very short and simple.

380
00:25:05,372 --> 00:25:08,223
Rym: No, I really liked it and you'll be able to see in the theater.

381
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:09,930
Rym: So hold out if you live in a city.

382
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:11,336
Rym: Yeah, we'll review it.

383
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:11,978
Scott: I liked it.

384
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:14,610
Scott: I just didn't think it was like, oh my god amazing spirit of ways.

385
00:25:14,731 --> 00:25:15,577
Scott: Oh my god amazing.

386
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:15,859
Scott: Yeah.

387
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:25,643
Rym: All right, so other than Spirited or other than all the other Miyazaki movies An animated feature that has come out recently.

388
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:27,470
Rym: that was better paprika.

389
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,717
Rym: How recent was that though?

390
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,245
Rym: a couple years couple years?

391
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:31,869
Rym: Is that recent?

392
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,376
Scott: What do you quit?

393
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:38,020
Scott: Okay, so if you're gonna Say compared to anything that came out.

394
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:47,628
Rym: It's the best thing in the last five minutes Plus, I think I could put it in the top 15 or 20 anime features Maybe top 50.

395
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:47,910
Rym: I don't know.

396
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,171
Rym: Maybe I'm thinking 15 or 20 when I think back to all the anime movies I've seen.

397
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:54,000
Rym: a lot of them are fun, but vampire hunter D.

398
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,444
Scott: It's like sky crawlers more.

399
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:57,310
Rym: I like sky crawlers a lot.

400
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,933
Rym: Consider them fairly equal.

401
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:04,660
Rym: Yeah, I guess one was more enjoyable, but one had a lot more interesting things to say.

402
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,829
Rym: I Think you can figure out which one was which people.

403
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:17,373
Rym: Anyway, the movie is great and it kind of reverses the trend of how and I think goes back toward more Miyazaki ish roots.

404
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:20,863
Rym: Yeah, plus it definitely in the opening bits has the.

405
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,408
Rym: yeah, it's Miyazaki.

406
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,293
Rym: pollution's bad We know let's go.

407
00:26:24,313 --> 00:26:25,255
Rym: Yeah, right.

408
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:30,870
Scott: He also really really likes to do like swarms of shit, especially if it's blobby shit.

409
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:33,010
Rym: Yeah, but I kind of like doing that a lot.

410
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:39,717
Rym: I like how the blobs of sea water are kind of like he did it in Princess Mononoke Did it in spirited away did in this movie?

411
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:43,950
Scott: Just you know, lots of you know move lots of moving swarms of blobs.

412
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:46,770
Rym: Yeah, meanwhile shiro not so many blobs.

413
00:26:47,495 --> 00:26:49,410
Scott: No shiro is not really about the blobs.

414
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:53,210
Rym: It's mostly people sitting quietly while being oppressed by their own existence.

415
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:55,369
Scott: Are you talking about oshi?

416
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:06,390
Rym: Yeah, yeah, it was like shiro doesn't have blobs, but then I was like, I admit it I was talking about she but there's so intertwined in my mind because it goes in the shell that I kept saying shiro.

417
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,073
Rym: now I'm an oshi.

418
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:10,590
Rym: shiro has blobs, but they're blobs of a different source.

419
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:20,936
Rym: So anyway things of the day this has nothing to do with anime.

420
00:27:20,957 --> 00:27:21,499
Rym: How about yours?

421
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,466
Rym: Comics awesome good enough.

422
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:27,535
Rym: I'll go first then because mine is totally irrelevant.

423
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:39,460
Rym: It's a video by some guy at RIT about how to take a shower at RIT and I bring it up only because he makes a couple of good jokes, but I realized why this video was made.

424
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:56,719
Rym: It was a project for freshman year in Richmond or FYE which at RIT is a class that they added when we got there as freshmen and The reason for the class is to teach people who suck How to not fail and moving out of their parents house.

425
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:01,240
Rym: It is like the worst class ever and if you don't take it you don't graduate.

426
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:03,340
Rym: It's not even worth any credits.

427
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:04,665
Rym: You just have to pass.

428
00:28:04,905 --> 00:28:09,020
Rym: you have to attend it and not be flunked in it, but the grade doesn't count for your GPA.

429
00:28:09,503 --> 00:28:10,430
Scott: I remember that class.

430
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,700
Scott: that class was a joke.

431
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,592
Rym: The class was like if you're gonna have sex use a condom.

432
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,200
Rym: if you're gonna drink don't drink until you puke.

433
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,289
Rym: If you get a credit card don't spend all your money.

434
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:22,594
Rym: Here's how to shower.

435
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:24,000
Rym: Here's why you should shower.

436
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:25,889
Rym: Here's how to go to class.

437
00:28:26,091 --> 00:28:27,138
Scott: I barely remember it.

438
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:32,460
Rym: I kind of remember it because I actually it was mine was in the dorms and it was on a Friday.

439
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:34,331
Scott: I was also in the dorms in that room.

440
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:37,265
Scott: That was at the bottom of What building.

441
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:37,688
Scott: was it?

442
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:39,499
Scott: the one right near the ATM machine?

443
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:43,854
Scott: ATM not ATM machine and the one we played board games in a few times.

444
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:45,260
Scott: Oh, yeah, it was in that room.

445
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:54,939
Rym: It was the only class at every RIT I ever had on the dorm side and it was only class I ever had at RIT on a Friday because I didn't get to pick it and I couldn't get out of it.

446
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:59,540
Scott: No, it's right near the the ResNet whatever room, you know what I'm talking about.

447
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:07,600
Rym: So one thing I would like to point out is that when his little shower caddy falls off the thing That's because those things were designed to not hold anything up.

448
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:11,877
Rym: they would fall down if you put more than like a pound's worth of even a half a pound of weight on him.

449
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:12,700
Scott: Wow and

450
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:27,373
Rym: Because RIT showers were like that and because I had nothing better and because I suddenly remembered how disgusted I was at the majority of people entering RIT and colleges in general Who kind of needed a class like that because as I would like to point out

451
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:28,757
Scott: that's the funny says the thing.

452
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:31,709
Scott: this video is Sort of a stupid YouTube video whatever.

453
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:42,400
Scott: but the thing that makes this video Powerful is that you just think of watch it realizing there are seriously no joke people who need this video.

454
00:29:42,924 --> 00:29:44,496
Scott: Otherwise, they won't know what to do.

455
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:50,923
Rym: one time I went to the shower guy was just standing in the bathroom naked trying to dry himself with that hand dryer Really?

456
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:54,820
Rym: Yeah, one time I found poop in one of the showers.

457
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:55,904
Rym: Awesome.

458
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:58,380
Rym: Yeah, you know how many time one?

459
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,780
Rym: You know how many times people would be in there barefoot and then like a month later, they would totally have funguses.

460
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:08,334
Scott: That was the funniest part where he said yeah one guy would go in without flip-flops.

461
00:30:08,454 --> 00:30:09,899
Scott: They'll have fungus up to his kneecaps.

462
00:30:12,122 --> 00:30:20,879
Rym: That's kind of lame but you know what that That video was not a joke to at least a third of the people who took my freshman year in Richmond class with me.

463
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,390
Rym: Wow, these were people who would like seriously my class.

464
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,815
Scott: last two quarters also.

465
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:26,256
Scott: Yes.

466
00:30:26,276 --> 00:30:33,362
Rym: Yeah like in the middle of class They would ask like we'd have the little Q&A at the end where we could like ask anything about RIT and one kid was Like.

467
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:36,880
Rym: so, how do I like not fail out of class?

468
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,316
Rym: Like I keep going to class, but I'm just not doing really well and like what do I do?

469
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,623
Scott: Be smart.

470
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:49,315
Rym: so the teachers like all right, so, uh, do you study?

471
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,980
Rym: he's like, yeah, well, I didn't really buy any of the books.

472
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:55,448
Rym: Do you go to class?

473
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:56,333
Rym: he's like like try to.

474
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:03,539
Rym: yeah You know what that kid wasn't in the second half of freshman year in Richmond because he totally failed out of RIT.

475
00:31:05,603 --> 00:31:06,287
Rym: Good.

476
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,040
Scott: Yeah his money paid for your education.

477
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:13,500
Rym: It was either that or I was gonna use the videos of the riot at RIT because I found those suddenly out of the blue.

478
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:20,965
Scott: so Quite often me and other people, you know yell about hey Monthly.

479
00:31:21,126 --> 00:31:22,332
Scott: comic books are stupid.

480
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:23,760
Scott: We should get rid of them, right?

481
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,886
Scott: Why do we still have these stupid little pamphlets?

482
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:32,440
Scott: and why are they raising the price of the pamphlets from 350 to $4?

483
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:44,355
Rym: probably because the market for Comics in that form is contracting due to the fact that the majority of those comics are marketed at it Increasingly shrinking due to old age and death demographic of people who must buy them all.

484
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:44,917
Scott: Yeah.

485
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:51,039
Scott: Anyway, So here is an editorial on a blog on news or Amma.

486
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:55,714
Scott: And basically it's a guy saying we should kill the monthly, right?

487
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:57,380
Rym: We should let me guess.

488
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,212
Rym: Is your thing of the day the comments of people replying to this?

489
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:09,379
Scott: Well, the comments are okay, too, but basically, the thing is that he brings up a point that is Interesting and somewhat new and that is why it's a thing of the day.

490
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:17,841
Scott: mostly the big point he brings up is that Putting out, you know, even if you excuse the format and the price or whatever right.

491
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:38,060
Scott: the idea of coming out with a small amount of comic every single month like Only works if you're you know Marvel or DC that doesn't work for anyone else, you know for anyone else like being you know Just coming out with a pamphlet that is of comic every month doesn't do it.

492
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,424
Scott: I mean who?

493
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:52,723
Scott: who really out there writes like serial stories that can be told in incredibly small Installments at four dollars apiece besides Marvel and DC with their superhero soap operas Nobody.

494
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:54,252
Scott: so it's like.

495
00:32:55,197 --> 00:33:16,100
Scott: it's like yeah I guess you know the fact that because that format is there and all these other people are somewhat forced to buy into that format even though it doesn't match the art they are creating, you know, it's sort of like if All these painters were forced to use like a small canvas when they're to like and then you know They were actually making really big paintings.

496
00:33:16,181 --> 00:33:19,260
Scott: You had to sort of put all these little small canvases together to get the big painting.

497
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:21,266
Scott: It's like now that's it's.

498
00:33:21,386 --> 00:33:25,439
Scott: it only works for the people making small paintings, which there are only two of all right, huh?

499
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,743
Rym: Yeah, all right.

500
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:27,627
Rym: I don't know.

501
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:30,500
Rym: I didn't need any more reasons to dislike the business model.

502
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:38,751
Scott: No, but honestly there are a shit ton of comments that are sort of they range from like yeah Fuck the monthly to all.

503
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:39,940
Scott: the monthly will always be here.

504
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:51,918
Rym: So when we were at RIT, I want to make you all realize how old we are compared to half of you But at the same time how young we are compared to the other half of you.

505
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:59,859
Rym: There were no Digital fan subs like what that came about in the course of us being at RIT like when we got to RIT.

506
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,803
Rym: Well, there were none.

507
00:34:00,823 --> 00:34:07,191
Scott: Well think about this everything in my senior year of high school Watching like a Kira on a VHS, right?

508
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,339
Scott: I own freshman year of RIT.

509
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:17,271
Scott: DVDs started to get popular but like people were buying Ps2s which were brand new to get the DVD player.

510
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,179
Scott: Yes DVD standalone DVD players were so expensive.

511
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,467
Rym: We think about this when we got to RIT.

512
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:26,279
Rym: None of us had DVD players because those were a crazy extravagance.

513
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,330
Scott: I know one had a DVD ROM either.

514
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:32,246
Rym: I had a DVD ROM but whoa So old, you know.

515
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:38,873
Rym: because they were expensive it could only play single-layer discs Because I couldn't afford DVDs.

516
00:34:39,337 --> 00:34:41,545
Rym: I didn't have any Right.

517
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:44,899
Scott: So we were buying anime on VHS, right?

518
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,052
Scott: The like I think greasy can had some anime on DVD.

519
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:52,500
Scott: that was like insane try gun on DVD, which is crazy.

520
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:54,409
Scott: I was like, oh my god, it's on DVD the store.

521
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,033
Scott: Holy shit.

522
00:34:55,072 --> 00:34:56,320
Scott: I didn't realize that right?

523
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,224
Rym: Well, not even that.

524
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:59,714
Rym: but it was that there were no like we did.

525
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:01,060
Rym: there weren't DVDs available to us.

526
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:08,780
Rym: We have DVD players and there were no digi subs like the first digi subs Like we're that year like the eskaflowne movie was one of them.

527
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,904
Rym: And even then there was like contra.

528
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:10,385
Rym: I had.

529
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:14,620
Scott: I had real media files of try gone on my hotline sir.

530
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:15,183
Rym: Oh my god.

531
00:35:15,204 --> 00:35:15,647
Rym: Those are like 120i.

532
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:19,244
Scott: Yeah, it was How he watched it.

533
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:27,061
Scott: All right, and I was getting tapes out of the VHS tapes from the club See checking them out regularly now This.

534
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:28,244
Rym: is it that the thing?

535
00:35:28,264 --> 00:35:32,960
Rym: that may it was hard to get into anime if you weren't already into anime at that time.

536
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:43,405
Rym: But being at the RIT anime club in RIT they had like 400 or so VHS tapes of Fan subs fan subs.

537
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:45,330
Rym: most of it was stuff that you couldn't buy.

538
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,360
Rym: it did not exist outside of VHS tapes and SVHS tapes.

539
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,860
Rym: So we had this bonanza and they were free to check out if we were members of the club.

540
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,275
Rym: So, you know the front row crew at the time, you know and extended parties.

541
00:35:57,295 --> 00:35:58,539
Rym: Hey, we're like eight or ten of us.

542
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,159
Rym: So Every club each one of us would take out three tapes.

543
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:08,736
Rym: So we'd get 30 VHS tapes and by God if we didn't watch all of them by the next anime.

544
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:16,882
Scott: at the very least you watch The three you got on your own But usually the ones that were sort of communally watchable were immediately watched Communally.

545
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:21,040
Rym: now the cool thing was we'd go up there and we didn't know like I didn't know what?

546
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:23,287
Rym: Anime was what other than we didn't know.

547
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:31,394
Rym: shit man if I knew now if I knew then when I know now good God I mean, I remember a point when someone said yeah, they're showing episode 5 of cowboy bebop.

548
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:33,220
Rym: Yeah, that's the one where spike fights vicious.

549
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:39,537
Rym: and I thought Cowboy bebop a guy named spike fights a guy named vicious.

550
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:40,360
Scott: That'd be good.

551
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,728
Scott: I was like, that's a real interesting name for a show.

552
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:44,314
Rym: that can't be good.

553
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:52,182
Rym: and then I learned yeah But what we would do is I would go up there all of us and they only let a few people into the library at A time.

554
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:58,113
Rym: so we'd get up there and I'd go over to the tape Nazi or one of the eboard members And they all knew their shit.

555
00:36:58,153 --> 00:37:00,966
Rym: I'd be like, hey What should we watch?

556
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:03,655
Rym: and they would just pick a tape up and be like watch this.

557
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:05,139
Rym: and they were always right?

558
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,979
Scott: Almost always right.

559
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:13,937
Rym: Well, they were always right in one way or the other either that it was good and should be watched or it was bad and should be Watched.

560
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:22,106
Scott: So anyway at one point we picked up a VHS fan sub tape of something called I don't know who picked it or why.

561
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:30,340
Rym: I think you did did I don't know pretty sure was you but it was called KO beast and it said one through three on it, right?

562
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,550
Scott: So and I think we also got two through seven.

563
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:34,454
Rym: We got it all.

564
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:35,700
Scott: we got it all on two tapes.

565
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:44,180
Rym: So long story short The the common thing to do at RIT for us was we'd all get together in one of the lounges probably Peterson.

566
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,956
Rym: But later on we moved into saw and we'd all sit around and we take the VCR.

567
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:55,156
Scott: cuz no we watch this I'm pretty sure on a on the tiny TV with the built-in VCR.

568
00:37:55,397 --> 00:37:59,732
Rym: Oh, right We probably did because the TV lounge anyway, there were.

569
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:02,280
Rym: we had two VCRs between all of us.

570
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:07,960
Rym: We had my VCR that we can only use if we found it a TV that wasn't being used that we could get the cords to.

571
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:14,137
Rym: Otherwise we had to use the combo TV VCR which barely worked and had a smaller screen.

572
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:14,960
Scott: It worked just fine.

573
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,924
Scott: It was just very small.

574
00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:19,480
Rym: Well, very small means barely worked when there's 10 or 15 people trying to watch.

575
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:22,112
Scott: Yeah, it was smaller than our monitors.

576
00:38:22,895 --> 00:38:23,880
Scott: That's how small it was.

577
00:38:24,643 --> 00:38:28,420
Rym: So what we would do is we'd hang out late it like on a Saturday morning.

578
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:30,206
Rym: We all get together eat breakfast at Gracie's.

579
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,336
Rym: then we just like watch anime for like all day and all night.

580
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:41,971
Rym: Yep, so One night, you know, we were watching anime for like several hours and then it's like, I don't know like midnight and someone's like Hey, let's watch this KO thing.

581
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,220
Rym: I bet it's a fighting show.

582
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:49,467
Scott: so we watched KO beast and I Remember that a we all liked it.

583
00:38:49,488 --> 00:38:50,692
Scott: I remember that.

584
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:53,160
Scott: be the openers and close it.

585
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:00,940
Scott: Well, the openers are really awesome and memorable the one Daba Daba opener for the first set of shows And the rock and roll bomber opener for the second set.

586
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,426
Rym: I was real tired like we were.

587
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:06,282
Rym: it was late and we put this thing in and I was fading fast and thinking to go Into bed.

588
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:10,500
Rym: the opener alone caused me to stay and watch this entire show.

589
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:19,762
Scott: I remember that it was about three animals a tiger guy a bird guy and a mer girl and I remember that Dr.

590
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:23,251
Scott: Password and that's really all I remembered of this show.

591
00:39:23,271 --> 00:39:28,400
Rym: I remember that it was about giant robots as well Forgot I forgot that it was about.

592
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:34,799
Rym: I remember the earth was cut in half and I knew Intuitively because I figured it out later.

593
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:41,466
Rym: But right around that time I'd started to identify, you know in my anime fandom voice actors I liked.

594
00:39:41,527 --> 00:39:51,180
Rym: I didn't know their names I didn't know who they were But I always be pretty sure like that's the same guy who plays this guy that I liked in that other show And I could pick out like three voice actors.

595
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,918
Rym: I didn't know who they were and I knew that Bud Minh was one of those voice actors.

596
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:58,836
Rym: I liked Yep, and that he talked in English all the time.

597
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:00,023
Rym: It was terrible I say.

598
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:01,920
Scott: I forgot that until I watch it again.

599
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:11,897
Rym: And I remembered one other thing and I remembered this like so clearly that when I watched this show again recently like I knew this whole scene from beginning to end.

600
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:18,319
Rym: but There's a scene where the computer has a custom-made trap for each one of them.

601
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:23,660
Rym: And I remember Bud Minh's trap so clearly because it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

602
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:29,698
Rym: I don't know why it cracks me up so much, but it just does I forget what the trap was And I just watched the show again.

603
00:40:30,642 --> 00:40:32,614
Rym: It's when he's like on the trapeze like he doesn't want.

604
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:34,165
Rym: like he's like they won't get me They won't get me.

605
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:38,732
Rym: and then just like a bird swing appears He's like joy, and he jumps out there.

606
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:46,680
Rym: He's swinging back and forth singing to himself like Alright, I remember now, and then that giant mace just fucking wrecks him out of nowhere.

607
00:40:47,764 --> 00:40:49,453
Scott: It's good stuff now.

608
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:53,740
Scott: so Yeah, so we got the show on DVD somewhat recently.

609
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,425
Scott: It's a legal US DVD.

610
00:40:55,465 --> 00:40:58,053
Scott: you can buy it right and we both.

611
00:40:58,294 --> 00:41:00,160
Scott: I ripped it and watched it on my iPhone Rym.

612
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,521
Scott: I think.

613
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:01,405
Scott: watch the DVD.

614
00:41:01,665 --> 00:41:08,969
Rym: one thing the show didn't actually get released in the US until like 2003 Really, yeah, it wasn't on VHS or anything.

615
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,313
Rym: It doesn't look like it.

616
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:10,474
Rym: Well.

617
00:41:10,514 --> 00:41:11,156
Scott: That's interesting.

618
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:12,260
Scott: It's just one team.

619
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:12,983
Scott: It's two TV.

620
00:41:13,044 --> 00:41:15,334
Scott: No three three DVDs, right?

621
00:41:15,354 --> 00:41:17,387
Scott: I Don't know how many DVDs.

622
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:26,377
Rym: You know what it is seven 30 or so minute OAV Episodes that were made over a course of multiple years.

623
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:29,627
Scott: yep And you know the first set has the.

624
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:30,771
Scott: you know that's.

625
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:38,383
Scott: one thing about the DVD is that since I had watched old fan subs I knew that the show had multiple openers on The DVD.

626
00:41:39,026 --> 00:41:41,740
Scott: the only opener is the rock and roll bomber open, which is crap.

627
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:44,300
Rym: I remember we were gonna show it to people because we got these DVDs.

628
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:49,300
Rym: So I put it in and the second opener plays, and I thought I had the wrong DVD or something was messed up.

629
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,725
Rym: So I'm like trying to figure it all out.

630
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:51,327
Rym: No.

631
00:41:51,488 --> 00:41:54,158
Rym: They just for whatever reason they took out the funny.

632
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:57,742
Rym: You know The

633
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:10,334
Scott: first opener is on the DVD in the extras section But they don't actually use it on the episodes and it'll confuse you because you'll start watching the show and at the end of the Opener it'll say KO beast three and you're like what do you mean three?

634
00:42:10,415 --> 00:42:11,097
Scott: Where's one?

635
00:42:11,178 --> 00:42:11,619
Scott: Where's two?

636
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:16,634
Scott: Because he's just they're using the third opener for every single episode which is annoying.

637
00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:21,852
Rym: now while that opener is pretty good I mean, I really like a rock and roll bomber.

638
00:42:21,892 --> 00:42:24,080
Scott: I mean rock and roll bomber is awesome.

639
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,808
Rym: Oh, you know me side ooh three two ones.

640
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:27,470
Rym: Let's go that.

641
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:29,837
Scott: ah is it three two ones.

642
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:33,492
Rym: Yeah zero Rockin roll bomber hey.

643
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:34,980
Scott: Oh, I think it is this hello.

644
00:42:35,883 --> 00:42:37,889
Rym: It doesn't matter that song is awesome.

645
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:39,755
Scott: It is awesome, but the ones have it.

646
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:41,460
Scott: have it have a song is also awesome.

647
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:50,005
Rym: Yes, and the thing the one thing I guess I didn't realize when I watched the show the first time was that it's really Primarily like.

648
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:52,234
Rym: I remembered it as being like 80% comedy 20% robot.

649
00:42:54,462 --> 00:42:59,000
Rym: It is like 50% comedy 50% robot like straight-up robot show.

650
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,543
Scott: Yeah, it's like.

651
00:42:59,584 --> 00:42:59,805
Scott: I didn't.

652
00:42:59,825 --> 00:43:05,357
Scott: I don't know why I didn't realize it or remember it But this show is actually a lot of robot goings-on.

653
00:43:05,397 --> 00:43:13,320
Scott: I mean, it's not Super robot and it's weird because while there's lots of robot going on like they're sort of there.

654
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,850
Scott: But it's not like.

655
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,360
Scott: the show is about the robots.

656
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,620
Scott: It's like somehow they managed to concentrate fully on the characters despite robot fighting.

657
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:35,688
Rym: But at the same time is that there's definitely a little bit of poking fun Homage at robot shows because all the cliches are there in kind of messed up ways and like they'll all conform in the big They'll form into the big robot right.

658
00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:38,720
Scott: and usually when you form into the big robot, let's say Voltron, right?

659
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,282
Scott: What happens?

660
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:43,880
Scott: everyone is in the central control room instead of in their individual cockpits, right?

661
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:54,832
Scott: When they form into the big robot in chaos entry beast the three characters get stuck in these tiny little balls and like this little Like triforce and they can't really move and they're crammed in there and

662
00:43:54,853 --> 00:43:56,117
Rym: like controlling the robots

663
00:43:56,137 --> 00:43:57,040
Scott: like another dimension

664
00:43:57,822 --> 00:44:00,080
Rym: Yell at the robots and the robots kind of listen to them.

665
00:44:00,361 --> 00:44:04,500
Scott: Well, the robots sort of are smart and do their own thing even when they're not in them.

666
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,958
Scott: So, you know the robots is sort of like their own characters that just don't talk which is kind of cool.

667
00:44:10,379 --> 00:44:14,268
Rym: I guess Yeah the show There's a lot of little like.

668
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:22,784
Rym: it's a goonie show It's you know, like there's wacky comedies nowadays like the wacky comedy anime that Dave Riley always makes fun of like, oh, hey Someone got punched.

669
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:23,768
Rym: It's a wacky anime.

670
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:26,180
Scott: excel saga is like a wacky anime.

671
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:29,434
Rym: This is wacky before that kind of wacky.

672
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:30,820
Rym: it's the old kind of wacky.

673
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,225
Scott: Yeah, that's definitely what it is.

674
00:44:32,245 --> 00:44:35,315
Scott: And I really got the slower pace to it.

675
00:44:35,736 --> 00:44:37,503
Scott: It's less extreme It's just got.

676
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:41,500
Scott: it's got fewer fewer jokes a little bit more subtle jokes.

677
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:49,807
Rym: a lot of the jokes are like throwaway references to other shows or like throwaway references to pop culture or just Throw away references to fucking.

678
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:50,529
Rym: I don't even know.

679
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:50,931
Scott: or they'll be.

680
00:44:50,971 --> 00:45:01,307
Scott: they'll be wacky things that are sort of subdued Like just the fact that the bird people use lots of English words, you know, it's not really like extreme comedy It's just sort of subdued.

681
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:03,180
Scott: They're speaking English words randomly.

682
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:07,439
Rym: Hey, baby, I'm the bomb.

683
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:10,752
Scott: Yeah, but it's kind of funny when they say something in English.

684
00:45:10,772 --> 00:45:13,504
Rym: Oh my god, Bud's not his dad I don't know.

685
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,859
Scott: Is it his dad or his grandpa?

686
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,700
Rym: It's the elder of the bird village who kind of looks like a cross between Uncle Sam and Colonel Sanders.

687
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:20,144
Rym: I don't know.

688
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:25,660
Scott: I think it looks more like Santa Claus, but short with a hunch, but the fact less fat.

689
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,013
Rym: But they there's this scene and the dove one the dubs terrible.

690
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:31,658
Rym: I'm not don't dubs terrible.

691
00:45:31,678 --> 00:45:49,284
Rym: But anyway He they asked him a question and you know a plot question and he thinks for a minute and got mumbles to himself and I'm going to quote exactly a B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Oh.

692
00:45:49,425 --> 00:46:00,040
Rym: and then he answers the question like what You just started saying the alphabet in English and then answers the question or like at one point the show.

693
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:01,865
Rym: You know, it's a robot show comedy show.

694
00:46:01,986 --> 00:46:05,798
Rym: one episode opens and they're like playing mahjong and it's totally.

695
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:06,500
Scott: that's the episode.

696
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,126
Scott: We're in the cave.

697
00:46:07,187 --> 00:46:08,419
Scott: They can't get out and they have no food.

698
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:11,900
Scott: So it starts and they're playing mahjong and whoever loses gets eaten.

699
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:15,000
Rym: That is one of the funniest scenes in the show when they just try to eat.

700
00:46:15,341 --> 00:46:17,472
Rym: I'm not gonna say who but it's just cuz.

701
00:46:17,512 --> 00:46:21,559
Rym: Maymar is like clinging on to him Just like she bit him and just wouldn't let go and he's running away.

702
00:46:22,122 --> 00:46:23,125
Scott: You know who I forgot about?

703
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:26,377
Scott: that's probably the best character in the show huddle Maymar's mom.

704
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:30,628
Rym: Oh my god She's one of those Characters.

705
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:33,151
Scott: Oh, yeah That's my kind.

706
00:46:33,212 --> 00:46:33,940
Rym: That's another thing.

707
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,422
Rym: It's kind of.

708
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,500
Rym: it's only used in parody and it's kind of underused now.

709
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,058
Rym: but that was like that was one of those anime tropes of all.

710
00:46:42,098 --> 00:46:48,040
Rym: just like The evil girls always have complicated hair or complicated hair girls are always evil cliche.

711
00:46:48,662 --> 00:46:50,929
Rym: You don't see that so much now because they all have complicated hair.

712
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:51,993
Scott: That's right.

713
00:46:52,013 --> 00:46:52,515
Scott: That's right.

714
00:46:52,535 --> 00:46:54,060
Rym: That used to be a big cliche.

715
00:46:54,703 --> 00:46:55,347
Scott: Yeah, cuz we know.

716
00:46:55,387 --> 00:46:57,660
Scott: nor than like the good girls in the shows, right?

717
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,119
Scott: I would always have like this real simple hair like just straight or just short, you know, that's it.

718
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:08,560
Scott: But like some girl would have like some like crazy hair that was just all over the place and that obviously meant that she was.

719
00:47:08,741 --> 00:47:13,280
Scott: Because no, you know good character would set up crazy hairstyles that are all over the place.

720
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:19,077
Rym: But chaos entry beast is kind of a. it is an old show is made in like the early 90s.

721
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,266
Scott: Yeah, it's an early 90s show.

722
00:47:21,286 --> 00:47:22,572
Scott: It's it's actually.

723
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,339
Scott: it's pretty good animation because it was an OAV.

724
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:31,040
Scott: So it actually looks like a sort of a later 90s show but with a less digital color technology.

725
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:36,558
Rym: But you know the animations pretty good animation kind like it holds up like if you look at you don't see.

726
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:37,180
Scott: it's not like.

727
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,180
Scott: You know, there aren't like lots of animation errors or anything like that.

728
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,203
Scott: It's like it was an OAV.

729
00:47:41,244 --> 00:47:46,080
Scott: they tried hard on this shit and apparently it was popular enough to make three sets of it.

730
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:50,660
Scott: You know normally, you know, if it was if it wasn't popular, they would have stopped after the first set.

731
00:47:50,821 --> 00:47:52,259
Scott: So that's that's pretty good right there.

732
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:57,718
Rym: Well from what I read now apparently it was originally like they made the original OAV in like.

733
00:47:57,758 --> 00:47:59,252
Rym: oh here we go 92 and it went.

734
00:47:59,293 --> 00:47:59,880
Rym: you know went over.

735
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:16,457
Rym: Okay as far as I can tell they didn't make the second OAV which you know on all the rest of the show until late 93 and Apparently the second project was pushed heavily by Ito and something project before which was like his studio at the time.

736
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:20,882
Rym: Mm-hmm Like they really pushed to have this thing get finished Uh-huh.

737
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:25,633
Rym: I don't know how it sold though because those numbers are not accessible to me.

738
00:48:25,814 --> 00:48:26,937
Scott: No, not really.

739
00:48:27,578 --> 00:48:37,605
Scott: Oh We're forgetting the most important part, but we should just Akumaka All right, so that is the other thing that I remembered from this show that It was like.

740
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:57,858
Scott: I guess she was the most memorable thing until just now and I forgot it Right is a character called Akumako and like I remembered Aku Oh, there were times where I could remember Akumako, but couldn't remember what show she was from and basically she's his little devil character That floats around near the bad guys and whenever someone's gonna die.

741
00:48:57,878 --> 00:49:00,087
Scott: She's like yes Yes die so I can eat your soul.

742
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:03,000
Scott: and she was just like a fork and a knife and she wants to eat souls.

743
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,440
Scott: And I watched the show again and she was still there.

744
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:10,273
Scott: She was still funny but it's like she almost doesn't even exist.

745
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:15,920
Scott: the other characters like Hardly ever even recognized her existence except for maybe two or three times.

746
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,219
Rym: well V darn does because he like he's kind of.

747
00:49:21,121 --> 00:49:25,802
Scott: He says something to her like a few times But that's.

748
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:33,320
Rym: and then once V shown like smacks her Those are in the lava and kills her cuz she's so annoying and scary.

749
00:49:33,481 --> 00:49:35,710
Scott: Yeah, but most of the time like she's just like yes.

750
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,180
Scott: Yes, give me your soul and no one says anything.

751
00:49:38,261 --> 00:49:39,339
Scott: It's like she's not even there.

752
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:42,952
Scott: You could edit the part you could edit her out and you wouldn't even notice.

753
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:50,396
Rym: but a lot of things in the show kind of Come out of nowhere like the fact that and the thing is you never learn about Akumaka.

754
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:51,499
Scott: Like why is she there?

755
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,123
Scott: Why are there?

756
00:49:53,384 --> 00:49:56,554
Scott: why they're devils that eat souls, why is he a mage night?

757
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:58,198
Rym: What is a mage night from?

758
00:49:58,259 --> 00:49:58,620
Scott: it's a dude.

759
00:49:59,123 --> 00:50:01,278
Scott: It's a dude with electric armor, obviously why?

760
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,551
Rym: Actually, there's a V darn manga that was separate really.

761
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:07,032
Rym: Yes.

762
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:08,858
Rym: I don't think it was ever translated.

763
00:50:08,878 --> 00:50:10,523
Rym: Wow I kind of wanted.

764
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:15,884
Scott: one thing I thought was interesting though was how you know V darn is sort of like the henchman of the Real bad guys, right?

765
00:50:16,345 --> 00:50:21,080
Scott: But eventually the real bad guys don't need him anymore, but he keeps going on his own.

766
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:29,169
Scott: Yeah, I sort of you don't see that happen too often whether just like the big bad guys just be like screw you henchman We don't need you anymore.

767
00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:29,855
Scott: Go you're not work.

768
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:30,340
Rym: Go away.

769
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,590
Rym: Well, the thing is the original like the feel V darn and vision.

770
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:34,533
Rym: they kind of start out.

771
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,580
Rym: They're basically Team Rocket.

772
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,802
Scott: Basically, yeah.

773
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:39,909
Rym: Yeah, but the show is a lot.

774
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:41,354
Scott: that V shown is pretty smart.

775
00:50:41,394 --> 00:50:42,177
Scott: rise in Team Rocket.

776
00:50:42,197 --> 00:50:42,899
Scott: They're both idiots.

777
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,330
Rym: Well, I don't me out there's pretty smart.

778
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:52,711
Scott: so I guess me out is Akumaka I guess But Akumaka was a lot stupider than me out.

779
00:50:53,052 --> 00:50:59,059
Rym: So the plot if you wonder is basically that the earth was split in two.

780
00:51:00,061 --> 00:51:06,789
Scott: Literally just two hemispheres went boop and no one knows why but it's in the opener But it's ancient history.

781
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:20,795
Rym: the three main characters Juan Daba Daba Daba his last name Bud mint by the way is voice-acted by nother not other than pumpkin head koyasu my man.

782
00:51:22,742 --> 00:51:26,654
Scott: The thing is he doesn't sound like his usual self because he's not.

783
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:28,280
Scott: it's not a be shown in type character.

784
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:29,006
Scott: Yes, he is.

785
00:51:29,067 --> 00:51:30,460
Rym: He's totally be shown in type character.

786
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,968
Rym: Well, he tries to be tries to be.

787
00:51:33,229 --> 00:51:36,038
Rym: he gets all the ladies until he turns into a chicken pretty much.

788
00:51:36,078 --> 00:51:38,696
Rym: Yeah Who is the mayor?

789
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:40,626
Scott: She's a mermaid.

790
00:51:41,128 --> 00:51:42,774
Rym: Yes, and she's she's kind of awesome.

791
00:51:42,794 --> 00:51:43,517
Scott: She's kind of cute too.

792
00:51:43,597 --> 00:51:44,280
Scott: Yeah, she's awesome.

793
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:44,922
Scott: I like her.

794
00:51:44,962 --> 00:51:50,860
Rym: don't forget Tuttle the sea turtle who is basically the only smart one who always just kind of hangs back.

795
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,271
Scott: It's basically the smart trusty quiet reliable guy.

796
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,037
Rym: and don't forget doc at all.

797
00:51:56,137 --> 00:51:57,080
Rym: pass a while.

798
00:51:58,787 --> 00:52:02,390
Rym: You need charm Passo his daughter.

799
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,940
Scott: She's the magical girl who's like the plot device.

800
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:07,493
Scott: She basically effectively a living McGuffin.

801
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:07,996
Scott: her.

802
00:52:08,278 --> 00:52:13,033
Rym: her Plot consists of screaming Juan's name and then making magic shit happen.

803
00:52:13,415 --> 00:52:15,060
Scott: Yeah accidentally, you know.

804
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:20,900
Scott: It's just like every other anime where there's a girl with a magical pendant who's you know, activates all the magic stuff.

805
00:52:21,001 --> 00:52:21,384
Scott: That's her.

806
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:30,200
Rym: and I just want to point out you'll see it when you watch this show, but The big evil bad guys in the end are basically whack-a-moles.

807
00:52:32,712 --> 00:52:33,963
Scott: Yeah Yeah, they kinda are.

808
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:43,852
Rym: I'm gonna say this if you want to see some people might balk and calling this old-school anime But it is of the school that is older than the current school.

809
00:52:44,233 --> 00:52:48,590
Rym: There is a school older than the old school if You look at current anime.

810
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,436
Rym: This is old school.

811
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:56,562
Scott: Yeah I mean, it's like it's weird because it's like there's old school older school and oldest school like the different School.

812
00:52:56,843 --> 00:53:02,039
Rym: it's like the difference between watching Tobor the eighth man versus watching eight man after.

813
00:53:03,241 --> 00:53:10,360
Scott: It's like 80s astro boy versus 60s astro boy, you know, but I highly recommend KO century beast one.

814
00:53:11,042 --> 00:53:11,865
Rym: It's super cheap.

815
00:53:11,885 --> 00:53:13,611
Rym: You can get the whole thing for like nothing.

816
00:53:13,631 --> 00:53:14,976
Scott: Yeah, this is not.

817
00:53:15,337 --> 00:53:18,607
Scott: if you can find it No one's gonna charge you a lot of money for it to.

818
00:53:19,048 --> 00:53:24,705
Rym: this show is kind of classic and I think it's kind of Underwatched and underrated.

819
00:53:24,745 --> 00:53:26,592
Scott: and under no, I think it's just under no.

820
00:53:26,612 --> 00:53:28,840
Scott: and the thing is it comes off as a little bit furry.

821
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:32,935
Scott: But you know because it's basically about you know beasts versus humans.

822
00:53:32,975 --> 00:53:36,306
Scott: That wasn't a concern for me Yeah, but the fur in is really there's.

823
00:53:36,326 --> 00:53:38,012
Scott: no there's no scary.

824
00:53:38,052 --> 00:53:40,178
Scott: fur in is just like they happen to be animal people.

825
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:41,303
Rym: whatever I don't know.

826
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,950
Rym: I didn't I didn't think to myself.

827
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:44,054
Rym: Well, is this furry?

828
00:53:44,195 --> 00:53:45,400
Rym: Well, is it scary furry?

829
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,336
Scott: Remember when what's-his-name did the awesome chaos entry beast cosplay?

830
00:53:50,476 --> 00:53:52,626
Rym: Oh my god We'll have to talk about that someday.

831
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:53,913
Scott: pictures of it around.

832
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:54,515
Rym: I'll find him.

833
00:53:54,536 --> 00:53:55,480
Rym: I'll make that a thing of the day.

834
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,042
Rym: That was one of the.

835
00:53:56,725 --> 00:53:58,613
Rym: that was quite a cosplay.

836
00:53:58,994 --> 00:54:00,340
Scott: Yeah, I like that.

837
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,800
Scott: It was great how they like showed up at the last second and then they got voted into winning.

838
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:07,106
Rym: No, we vote they got second place.

839
00:54:07,186 --> 00:54:07,768
Scott: Oh, did they?

840
00:54:07,808 --> 00:54:11,096
Rym: because the crowd actually, you know who won that cosplay?

841
00:54:11,577 --> 00:54:13,202
Rym: No, Emily Really?

842
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:15,388
Rym: That was Emily who won with her.

843
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:16,291
Rym: Well, I'll talk.

844
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:17,474
Rym: I'll save that for what.

845
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:19,340
Scott: that was the Princess Mononoke costume.

846
00:54:19,661 --> 00:54:23,735
Rym: That was a good guy before Emily and I were dating and I as far as I was.

847
00:54:23,776 --> 00:54:27,373
Scott: he even had like little boots on That costume as far as I was concerned.

848
00:54:27,414 --> 00:54:33,560
Rym: She was just this really Incredibly cute girl who showed up to the anime club and it had a little cape and it had a little masky thing.

849
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:45,094
Rym: Yeah, so basically the club voted to give her first place and then this like professional cosplay got second place partly because it While it was awesome, it lacked heart and it showed up late.

850
00:54:45,436 --> 00:54:52,127
Rym: Yeah Oh Man those were good days, but KO century beasts.

851
00:54:52,148 --> 00:55:00,140
Rym: Well, if you haven't seen a lot of older anime It'll really kind of put you into that old-school watching anime move.

852
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:08,432
Scott: Yeah, really, you know, it's not like the greatest show in the universe, but it makes you feel like it's 1999 When you watch this shit, yeah, like this show.

853
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:10,260
Rym: really this was my fandom back then.

854
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,052
Rym: I mean if you like this, you should probably watch like it's a.

855
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:14,880
Scott: it's got a lot of nostalgia powers.

856
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:25,472
Scott: So if you don't feel that nostalgia it might weaken the show for you the way around that Watch it late at night with a group of people definitely Definitely in that genre of watching it alone.

857
00:55:25,513 --> 00:55:34,928
Scott: You might be like, okay, it's an anime big deal But if you watch it like anime club with a whole bunch of anime fans or at a convention with a bunch of sugared up Kids, it'll be pretty awesome.

858
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:44,980
Rym: If we get the the secret Otakon plan I can't reveal what that is yet But if the secret Otakon plan comes to pass this show is so being shown at midnight.

859
00:55:45,322 --> 00:55:46,350
Scott: No, I don't know.

860
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,860
Scott: there are better things to show at midnight.

861
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,929
Rym: Yeah, maybe at 11 before the midnight showing.

862
00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:52,854
Scott: well say we got a. what's a plan?

863
00:55:52,874 --> 00:56:01,643
Rym: Yeah, but I got ideas for the show, but If you like this show watch like I don't know the old birdie the mighty or like I don't know.

864
00:56:01,663 --> 00:56:08,620
Rym: I'm trying to think of a good segue and maybe the new birdie the mighty watch birdie the mighty Show is like chaos century beast.

865
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:10,762
Rym: There aren't many Those.

866
00:56:10,983 --> 00:56:14,312
Rym: if you like robot shows watch this because it will.

867
00:56:14,673 --> 00:56:17,140
Rym: they will point out other robot shows in a big way.

868
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,568
Scott: Koto-cha is a little similar a little bit.

869
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,154
Rym: Yeah, it has that similar like.

870
00:56:21,174 --> 00:56:25,528
Scott: it's around the same Time-frame and it's also a comedy.

871
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,637
Scott: doesn't have robots though, but you know a little bit.

872
00:56:28,978 --> 00:56:32,915
Rym: Yeah You know, this show is just worth watching if you're an anime fan.

873
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,100
Rym: I feel like you should have seen it.

874
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:34,581
Scott: Yeah, I do.

875
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:52,740
Scott: I do think it's unique though in that most robot shows tend to either be you know the sort of like, you know, super serious like a Gundam or a gassaraki kind of thing or There's sort of like messenger sort of you know kids wackiness go guy gar.

876
00:56:53,162 --> 00:56:54,709
Scott: This is sort of like a weird.

877
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,020
Scott: Where do you see like the comedy robot show?

878
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:03,640
Scott: It's not something you see too often At least I can't really think of any and it definitely it does play it straight about this time.

879
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:09,000
Rym: But kind of you know slayers will always kind of be like it's dumb and certain awesome and hilarious.

880
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,696
Scott: There'll be one episode about a fish man But eventually it gets around to a serious fantasy plan.

881
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:16,663
Rym: even during the series It'll always keep.

882
00:57:16,884 --> 00:57:18,689
Rym: it'll periodically jump back to the comedy.

883
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:22,040
Scott: Yeah, they'll be like it's like in a funny episode a fish man episode.

884
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:28,260
Scott: They'll be jokes the whole time, but in a serious episode They'll just be like, you know, five to ten jokes at random spots.

885
00:57:28,341 --> 00:57:35,892
Rym: But they'll be short jokes You know and slayers will always have a place in my heart for the fact that it was the first show I saw where someone took a sweat drop and tried to kill someone with it.

886
00:57:35,912 --> 00:57:36,897
Scott: Yeah, it was a good one.

887
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:40,647
Rym: and Anyway, this isn't the Slayer show.

888
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:43,760
Rym: Yeah, those slayers has a similar fandom era for me.

889
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:52,140
Scott: Yeah, slayers like fantasy plus comedy and it's sort of like the same level of comedy as ko beast almost except Maybe it has more quantity of comedy.

890
00:57:52,341 --> 00:57:58,789
Rym: But this show does have a plot and the plot actually despite being a primarily a comedy Isn't that bad?

891
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,600
Rym: like it plays itself pretty well.

892
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,280
Scott: It's an average anime plot, you know bad guys are up to no good.

893
00:58:04,561 --> 00:58:07,290
Scott: There's a little bit of mystery of what Gaia is.

894
00:58:07,711 --> 00:58:10,200
Scott: the characters don't really know what they're doing, but they're doing it.

895
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:17,320
Scott: Anyway, they're all kind of idiot jerks and in each episode like weird stuff happens like that to repair the robots.

896
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:22,498
Scott: But the guy who was gonna repair the robots is actually like two pigs who were standing on top of each other.

897
00:58:22,518 --> 00:58:23,582
Rym: Oh my god I loved him.

898
00:58:24,044 --> 00:58:32,231
Rym: that episode in particular that whole episode was so slayers because they're like in the town Eating all the food in the inn and then everything gets destroyed.

899
00:58:32,311 --> 00:58:35,260
Scott: So is the episode where the bird down all the bird town.

900
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:43,422
Rym: Yeah, if the show like it jumps genres a whole bunch, but it always comes back to robot show Mm-hmm.

901
00:58:44,305 --> 00:58:45,408
Rym: I don't know what else we can say.

902
00:58:45,528 --> 00:58:49,600
Scott: I'd recommend it's not allowed to say about seven episodes without spoiling the whole thing.

903
00:58:49,761 --> 00:58:51,649
Rym: I just I'd really recommend checking it out.

Rym: It's kind of short, you know seven episodes.

905
