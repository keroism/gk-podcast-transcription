1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,720
Rym: All right, welcome to GeekNights Special #1.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,460
Scott: As promised, we're doing a special weekend podcast because we didn't do one on Thursday.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,200
Rym: Now, we didn't do one on Thursday for, well, we said we had a certain reason, but we ended up having a completely different reason, which we'll talk about on Monday.

4
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,920
Scott: Yeah, two or three reasons, yeah.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,280
Rym: Anyway, since this is the first one, I'll do a little bit of explaining.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,479
Rym: Now, normally GeekNights is four nights a week, Monday through Thursday, and every day is a different topic.

7
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,260
Scott: If this is your first time ever listening to GeekNights, go back.

8
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:32,000
Scott: Listen to something else.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,458
Scott: Anything else but this.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,720
Rym: Yeah, this is a special, meaning it's in the unscheduled category in addition to the podcast category.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,896
Scott: Meaning it's also crap.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,160
Rym: Yeah, this is not GeekNights.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:52,120
Rym: This is whenever we screw up or don't have an episode or whenever something crazy happens and we have to do an extra episode, it'll be a special.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,579
Scott: Which means it's half-assed.

15
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:58,500
Rym: Yeah, not only is it half-assed, but I'm using hardware that's barely functioning.

16
00:00:59,226 --> 00:00:59,540
Scott: Awesome.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,020
Rym: Which I'll talk about on Monday in great detail.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,279
Scott: Alright, enough of that.

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:14,020
Scott: So, for our little special to make up for no episode, we're gonna tell you a little, well, story slash, I don't know, rant, kind of?

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,000
Rym: Yeah, kind of a little bit of- Informative action?

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,620
Rym: Something.

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,338
Scott: Alright, so, if any of you watch Seinfeld, you might have known the joke about Jerry's no-vomit streak.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,660
Rym: Yep, it was destroyed, I believe, by a black and white cookie.

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,380
Scott: Yes, and he hadn't vomited for a very long period of time, many years, and then he ate a black and white cookie and vomited.

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:41,239
Scott: Well, me, Scott, has a similar vomit streak, where I haven't vomited in years and years and years and years.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,521
Scott: Now,

27
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:58,700
Rym: contrast this to about six months ago when Scott had to deal, well, he's in his room and I have the master bedroom, which is on the other side of the, it takes up the whole half of the house, and then there's a hallway, and then the other half of the house is Scott's room, his walk-in closet, and the walk-in closet is directly adjacent to the upstairs bathroom.

28
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:02,640
Rym: So he heard me, and I had food poisoning, horrible food poisoning.

29
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:03,360
Scott: Or something.

30
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:04,780
Rym: Yeah, it was food poisoning.

31
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,360
Rym: It was bad.

32
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,480
Rym: I'm reasonably certain.

33
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:13,012
Rym: And basically every 10 minutes for most of that night, I bargled, vomited violently and loudly.

34
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,960
Scott: It was so loud.

35
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,259
Scott: God, it was so loud.

36
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:22,479
Scott: Now, it had happened so many times, he just kept waking my ass up.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:22,726
Rym: Oh!

38
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:23,844
Rym: Oh!

39
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:24,838
Rym: Ugh!

40
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:26,260
Scott: Yeah.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,850
Rym: Followed by the ritual of, you know, rinse mouth out, flush toilet, wash teeth, go to bed.

42
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:34,240
Scott: Now, I hadn't vomited in years, until Friday.

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,140
Rym: Now, he'd come close, but he didn't, actually.

44
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,120
Rym: I remember one time he got really sick with some other, the opposite vomit.

45
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,679
Scott: Yeah, see, I really don't get sick.

46
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:50,280
Scott: The only thing that ever happens to me, is sometimes I'll eat bad food, or sometimes I'll eat the wrong mix of foods, or sometimes I'll eat too much food.

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,679
Scott: And then my stomach will go, "What did you do?

48
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:54,137
Scott: What did you do?

49
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:56,096
Scott: Why did you do

50
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:56,259
Scott: that?".

51
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,500
Rym: You tried to do too much with it.

52
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,560
Scott: You tried to do too much.

53
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:00,940
Scott: Now I will make you very unpleasant.

54
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,660
Scott: And then after like a day or two, I'm back to normal.

55
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:05,720
Scott: But that's the only real illness I ever get.

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,900
Rym: So this weekend, we had almost all of the core front row crew over for a crazy board gaming weekend.

57
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,759
Rym: In fact, we're going to spend all of Tuesday covering, in order, all the games we played this weekend.

58
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:18,420
Scott: Awesome.

59
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:26,720
Rym: And it was the core group, except for Katsu, he was busy or something, but he was the only one who wasn't here, of the like chorus, chorus, original front row crew.

60
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,820
Rym: There are a lot more people in the front row crew, but that was like the original.

61
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,287
Scott: Yep.

62
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,000
Rym: And we played a million board games, and we'd had to, Pete, his Amtrak was late.

63
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:37,400
Rym: We never would have seen that coming.

64
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:37,782
Rym: No.

65
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:39,680
Scott: That is a big surprise.

66
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:45,357
Rym: So we had to drive, he missed his connecting train to Beacon, so we had to drive up to Poughkeepsie to pick his ass up.

67
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:50,739
Rym: And we were real hungry, and there weren't so many restaurants up there that we wanted to eat at.

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,700
Rym: Well, many that Scott wanted to eat at.

69
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,640
Scott: But you were, the only places you picked are places you knew I don't like.

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:55,940
Scott: What?

71
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,740
Scott: Like, hey, let's go to the fish place.

72
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,819
Scott: Hey, let's go to the nasty ass Uno Pizzeria.

73
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:01,379
Rym: Name another place up there.

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,960
Scott: That's my point.

75
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,477
Rym: Yeah.

76
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,400
Rym: So eventually we pass a coyote grill, which we decide, all right, let's go there.

77
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:08,100
Rym: Coyote.

78
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,740
Rym: Yeah, it's coyote to all you Easterners here.

79
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,319
Rym: That's right.

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,204
Rym: It's coyote.

81
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:14,459
Rym: to people in the West who actually know what the hell that dog is.

82
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,420
Scott: No, it's a coyote.

83
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:16,119
Scott: It's a coyote.

84
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,040
Scott: Like Wile E. Coyote.

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,959
Scott: It's not Wile.

86
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:18,877
Scott: Coyote.

87
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:19,959
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

88
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,060
Rym: People mispronounce a lot of words.

89
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:22,720
Scott: It's not Wile O. Coyote.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,080
Scott: It's Wile E. Coyote.

91
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,380
Rym: Now, while the team is called the Celtics, the word is Celtic.

92
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:28,598
Scott: Yes.

93
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:29,880
Scott: That is correct.

94
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,760
Rym: It's the same thing.

95
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,068
Rym: The word...

96
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,760
Scott: But the basketball team is the Celtics.

97
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:33,155
Scott: Yeah.

98
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,460
Scott: If you try to say Boston Celtics, I'll kick your ass.

99
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,218
Rym: Though I will say...

100
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,879
Scott: Probably not, because I don't care that much, but...

101
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,020
Rym: Yeah, but even then, when I hear someone say Celtics, it's still a great sound to me, because I know it's a mispronunciation, even though it's accepted.

102
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,060
Rym: Kind of like Garymandering versus gerrymandering, but that's a whole other show.

103
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,898
Scott: Anyway, we go to the place.

104
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:50,519
Rym: The place was good food.

105
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,580
Rym: It was real good food.

106
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,660
Scott: Yeah, it was pretty good food.

107
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,200
Scott: It was sort of a fancy hip place, like something you'll see in a spy movie or something.

108
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,160
Rym: Yeah, like take stuff on the walls and upgrade it like two categories.

109
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:02,540
Scott: Yeah, but it was still a chain of some sort.

110
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,140
Scott: But it's one of those chains that there aren't so many of them.

111
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,080
Scott: Kind of like Smoky Bones.

112
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:13,678
Rym: But the food was a weird combination of Asian food and Western food and just a whole... Italian food.

113
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:19,360
Scott: It was Mexican, Asian, Italian, and American food all mixed up.

114
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:23,898
Rym: And a lot of them, like dishes, were two different kinds of food mixed together, and it was all really good.

115
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,432
Scott: Yep.

116
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,371
Rym: And Scott got...

117
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,400
Scott: I got this barbecue chicken sandwich that was really good.

118
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,000
Rym: Now you ate the second half of it for dinner today, and it didn't make you bargo.

119
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:32,819
Scott: No, it didn't.

120
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:33,280
Scott: Yes.

121
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:36,839
Rym: I'm really not feeling...

122
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,600
Scott: I think... All right.

123
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,700
Scott: So around Thursday, like I didn't... Thursday I went to the city, and I didn't really eat much on Thursday.

124
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,359
Scott: I ate like a bagel, and then I got home and ate dinner, and that was it.

125
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:48,937
Rym: Yep.

126
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,439
Rym: Friday you didn't eat so much either.

127
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,440
Scott: Friday I didn't eat too much until we went to this grill.

128
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:59,200
Scott: So I had gone two days without eating, but for some reason I didn't feel real hungry.

129
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,539
Scott: Like my body didn't say eat a lot of food.

130
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,720
Scott: But I knew I hadn't eaten, but my stomach didn't say fill me up, but I ate anyway.

131
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,296
Scott: And I think that's... There was something going on before.

132
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,960
Scott: I got... I don't think it was the food from that grill.

133
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,580
Scott: I think it just happened to be that's where I ate, and there was something wrong beforehand.

134
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:18,777
Scott: I don't know what it was.

135
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:34,495
Rym: Sorry to interrupt, but while we're recording the show right now, the GeekNights special, and I just got messaged by someone, one of our listeners, Brian, the person who won the design contest, bugging us about the fact that we didn't upload the GeekNights special yet.

136
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,360
Scott: Okay, Lowell.

137
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:35,787
Rym: Yeah.

138
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:50,420
Scott: So anyway, we ate at this place after two days of me not eating and not feeling very hungry, and then that night I wasn't feeling 100%, but I didn't feel too bad, went to bed, and I don't know, when did we go to bed that night?

139
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,798
Rym: Oh God, it was like two.

140
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:53,979
Scott: No, because I woke up at two.

141
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,300
Rym: No, no, we went to bed early.

142
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,740
Rym: We stayed up late Saturday.

143
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,216
Scott: Right.

144
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,740
Rym: Yeah, we went to bed early, like midnight.

145
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:03,179
Scott: All right, so around two hours later at two, I woke up with a mad stomach pain.

146
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,599
Scott: So I went to the bathroom and I had me some wet, wet number two.

147
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:09,740
Scott: Great.

148
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,580
Scott: Yeah, it was bad.

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,319
Rym: Now, I remember the last time that happened to you.

150
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,180
Rym: Didn't you cure it by laying naked on the bathroom floor?

151
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,159
Scott: That is correct.

152
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:19,600
Scott: The last time I cured my stomach illness.

153
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:23,220
Rym: I thank the demon lord that I didn't stumble in upon that.

154
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,680
Scott: Yes.

155
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:25,680
Scott: I think we talked about this on an early episode.

156
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:26,398
Rym: I think we did.

157
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:27,260
Scott: Anyway.

158
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:34,660
Rym: So if you want to hear the story of Scott lying naked on the bathroom floor after diarrhea-ing for quite some time, search through the archives.

159
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,100
Scott: Yes.

160
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,580
Scott: Now, here's another story about Scott sitting naked on the bathroom floor.

161
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:39,934
Scott: Wow.

162
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:41,940
Scott: I had a diarrhea.

163
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,239
Rym: Do I need to add a category for this?

164
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:44,755
Scott: No.

165
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,140
Rym: Scott naked on the bathroom floor, episode four.

166
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,000
Scott: And then after I was done, it was still pretty painful, like worse than the last time.

167
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,119
Scott: So I'm like, you know what, I'll try that again.

168
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,200
Scott: It worked the last time.

169
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,740
Scott: And I was sweating balls.

170
00:07:58,724 --> 00:07:59,259
Scott: God damn.

171
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:11,920
Rym: Now, to elucidate that point, now on Thursday at my work, I saw the forecast for the weekend and it said that it was going to rain nonstop.

172
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,600
Rym: The percentage chance of rain was 100.

173
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,080
Rym: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to the following Thursday.

174
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:24,280
Rym: It predicted up to eight inches of rain in Beacon over two days.

175
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:25,520
Rym: That is insane.

176
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,700
Rym: Now the actual reality is that it didn't rain at all.

177
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,659
Scott: It rained a bit today.

178
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,078
Rym: It rained a tiny bit.

179
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,059
Scott: Not as much as it could have and should have.

180
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,977
Rym: Instead, there has been this constant haze as clouds descended upon us and it didn't rain.

181
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:49,317
Rym: The humidity was 100 billion percent and it's like 80 degrees, my air conditioner could barely keep up, I'm running the air conditioner super cold just to keep the humidity out of my room.

182
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:49,880
Scott: Yep.

183
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,000
Rym: In fact, you might hear the audio sound a little odd.

184
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:56,817
Rym: That's because the air conditioning in the fan is going full blast in the background of the studio.

185
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:58,179
Scott: And we're not turning it off.

186
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:03,740
Scott: So, I had a diarrhea and I was still in a lot of pain, unlike usually it's a relief.

187
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,400
Scott: It wasn't so much of a relief.

188
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,718
Scott: Some feverish.

189
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,340
Rym: Now, at what point did you think, wait a minute, is the streak over?

190
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:14,960
Scott: You know what, every time this happens, I think it might be the end of the streak.

191
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,179
Scott: You know, it's like I wake up in the middle of the night with pain and I say, I hope this isn't the end of the streak is the first thing I think.

192
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:21,639
Scott: I'm perfect.

193
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,679
Scott: That's completely honest.

194
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,979
Scott: That's the first thing I think is, ah, this might be the end.

195
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,098
Scott: Please let it not be the end.

196
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,498
Rym: So you contrast this with me.

197
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:38,820
Rym: Now, when I do get sick, which honestly, once I left Rochester and college and started getting sleep and eating properly, I almost never get sick anymore.

198
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,797
Scott: Well, you did get sick that night when you were just vomiting 20 times.

199
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:43,935
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

200
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,375
Rym: But I mean, compared to when I was in college, I get sick maybe two or three times a year at most now.

201
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:50,899
Scott: I have very good health.

202
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,170
Scott: Since around, ever since I had the pneumonia, I think I was in middle school for like a week.

203
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:59,460
Scott: My rate of sickness has really not changed at all.

204
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,320
Scott: It's like once every few months, stomach problem for a night.

205
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:03,897
Scott: The end.

206
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,480
Scott: That's it.

207
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,180
Scott: That's the only sickness I've had for years and years and years and years and years.

208
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,580
Rym: But when I do get sick, my body for some reason is on a vomit hair trigger.

209
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,320
Rym: It's like my body.

210
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,140
Scott: You have built in Ipikat gland.

211
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,776
Rym: You know what?

212
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:20,860
Rym: If all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like vomit.

213
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:24,500
Rym: So if I get sick, I just vomit.

214
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:26,680
Rym: If my stomach is, I just vomit.

215
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:34,240
Rym: In fact, I think I told the story of when I got food poisoning in New York City and I vomited so much I'd go to the hospital and I might have died.

216
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:34,725
Scott: Wow.

217
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:35,540
Scott: Yeah, that's right.

218
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:35,911
Scott: Yeah.

219
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,840
Scott: So I'm laying on the floor in pain and the cold floor actually kind of helped even though I was completely covered in sweat.

220
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:46,819
Scott: I mean, it was as if I had been in a sweat swimming pool.

221
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,638
Scott: Like it was dripping out of my hair like a faucet.

222
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,200
Scott: It was crazy.

223
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Scott: I was all feverish with stomach pains, lying on the bathroom floor.

224
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:57,894
Scott: You know?

225
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,340
Scott: This is about the only part of me that wasn't nasty was my ass because I just wiped it after having calorie.

226
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,580
Rym: Yeah, I wanted to know about that.

227
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:05,860
Rym: Yeah.

228
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:09,240
Rym: If you want to continue with that, I can go into great detail.

229
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,020
Rym: Every time I vomited when I had food poisoning.

230
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:16,455
Rym: The difference as time went on in what was coming out of me.

231
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:21,740
Rym: because just when you think there's nothing left in my body, there's absolutely nothing that can come out.

232
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,139
Rym: Something new would come out.

233
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,580
Rym: Something new and frightening.

234
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,200
Rym: A new frontier of vomit.

235
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,439
Scott: So it didn't really feel nauseous, like whoa, dizzy, nauseous.

236
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:33,580
Scott: And I didn't really feel anything except the pain in the stomach.

237
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:38,840
Scott: And then I finally decided, yeah, you know, I'll go up to the toilet there.

238
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:41,940
Scott: It didn't really feel like I had to vomit that bad.

239
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,740
Rym: No, I've done that before.

240
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,719
Scott: Not any more than any other time I was sick.

241
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,700
Rym: You know, when you get over the toilet, like if it's going to come, I want to be ready.

242
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:48,398
Rym: And then you see.

243
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,140
Rym: And then if it doesn't happen, you go back to bed.

244
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,819
Rym: That kind of thing.

245
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,520
Scott: Yeah.

246
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,780
Scott: It's like I didn't, you know, other times that I had the stomach sickness, it's like vomiting was there as an option.

247
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,759
Scott: Like if I tried a little bit, I could have vomited easily, but I held back for the sake of the streak.

248
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,232
Rym: Wow.

249
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:04,040
Rym: If my body wants me to vomit, I figure it knows what it's doing.

250
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,220
Scott: Well, it didn't want to vomit super bad.

251
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,259
Scott: It only said you can vomit if you want to.

252
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:10,799
Scott: It wasn't like a super strong bardole.

253
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,400
Rym: In fact, one time I've made myself vomit prematurely to prevent future problems.

254
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:16,808
Scott: Yep.

255
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,160
Rym: That was when we got that orange juice that went bad.

256
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,447
Scott: Yep.

257
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:19,989
Rym: Yeah.

258
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:21,700
Rym: I'll talk about that someday.

259
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,008
Scott: Okay.

260
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,719
Scott: So I get up to the toilet and I'm like, all right, yeah.

261
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:27,078
Scott: And I bargled.

262
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:28,500
Scott: Oh, then I bargled.

263
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:28,958
Scott: I can't.

264
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,899
Scott: It was so bad.

265
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:34,540
Scott: Well, it's kind of weird because it wasn't, I haven't bargled in a long time, you see.

266
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:38,640
Scott: So I didn't quite remember a hundred percent the feeling of vomiting.

267
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:44,800
Rym: You know, it always feels really good after you're done and your body says, your body says, all right, you did me good.

268
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:45,959
Scott: It sure does.

269
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,839
Rym: That'll do pig.

270
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,040
Scott: But, uh, you know, what came out was pretty much that sandwich I ate for dinner and it was happy.

271
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,459
Scott: You can see, you can see like, okay, there's some bread, there's some onion, there's some chicken, there's some barbecue sauce.

272
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:10,659
Rym: Now see, the only times I've ever vomited like that where undigested food came back was when I had done something wrong, like not slept in several days or not eaten for two days and then eaten.

273
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:25,220
Scott: The only time I remember vomiting where what came up was like not just, didn't look like the fake puke you buy at the store was when I drank too much grape juice and I barfed up purple shit out my nose and my everything.

274
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:27,359
Rym: One time I had the flu.

275
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:34,760
Rym: I was a little kid and my little brother, all I remember is that he ran out of the room screaming.

276
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,000
Rym: Now I was really sick.

277
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,320
Rym: I had the flu and I was staying home from school and we had a vomit bucket.

278
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:57,160
Rym: It was this old popcorn bowl that we used whenever a kid was sick in the house or whenever the parent, whenever someone was sick and it laid next to the couch and I was laying there watching like mask or something on TV on a tape and I had eaten a whole bunch of green jello and I hadn't vomited yet.

279
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:58,679
Rym: So we didn't think this was a vomiting flu.

280
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,860
Rym: It was just a flu flu and there was no warning.

281
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:03,060
Rym: There was no nothing.

282
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,820
Rym: I was sitting there.

283
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,839
Scott: So you should have made jello.

284
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,569
Scott: God damn it.

285
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,559
Scott: You should have made a jello.

286
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,620
Rym: Hey, at least you had the lassi.

287
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:09,840
Scott: The what?

288
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,339
Rym: The lassi.

289
00:14:10,822 --> 00:14:11,119
Scott: Lassi.

290
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:11,390
Scott: Yeah.

291
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:12,299
Scott: I was like lassi.

292
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:12,999
Scott: That's a dog.

293
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:32,470
Rym: But I was sitting there and suddenly I just felt this horrible urge and I turned and a force and it filled the bucket and overflowed and

294
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,692
Scott: my little brother had to have

295
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:47,000
Rym: been like four or five and he ran out of the room screaming and my mom runs in like, what?

296
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:47,899
Rym: What is busy?

297
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,257
Rym: Dead.

298
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,815
Rym: What's going on?

299
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,679
Rym: I'm just, there's a pile of vomit.

300
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:51,858
Rym: Just green.

301
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:53,118
Scott: All right.

302
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:57,300
Scott: So, you know, I vomited, you know, a couple of times.

303
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,220
Scott: It wasn't, you know, I guess you could lump them all into one vomit.

304
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,419
Scott: It was like vomit, stop, vomit, stop, vomit, stop.

305
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:03,917
Scott: Vomit, stop.

306
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,374
Scott: The end.

307
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,195
Scott: And that was it.

308
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:06,440
Scott: Didn't vomit anymore.

309
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,560
Scott: Then I took a shower immediately.

310
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,016
Rym: Yeah.

311
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:09,739
Rym: I always do that.

312
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:14,158
Scott: And while I was in the shower, I felt some vomit still at the back of my throat and in my nose.

313
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,238
Scott: So I kind of blew my nose and like a piece of chicken came out.

314
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,538
Scott: It was a piece of chicken sitting in the drain of the shower and I was looking at it.

315
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,480
Scott: I was feverish, slightly delusional.

316
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:35,279
Scott: I'm feverish, slightly delusional in a slightly cold shower looking down at the drain at this piece of chicken.

317
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,619
Scott: And I stood there for a few minutes.

318
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,456
Rym: Yeah.

319
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,399
Rym: I know that delusion state where you just don't know what's going on.

320
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Scott: It wasn't like LSD delusional, but it was fever delusional.

321
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:50,280
Scott: So after I decided I was no longer covered in sweat, I dried off.

322
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:51,498
Scott: It's nice and cool.

323
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:55,360
Scott: Went back to bed, still had a little grumpiness.

324
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,617
Scott: I got up a few hours later for just a little bit of diarrhea, but that was it.

325
00:15:59,805 --> 00:15:59,880
Rym: Yep.

326
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,090
Scott: No.

327
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,820
Scott: And I haven't had a bowel movement since Friday night and it's Sunday.

328
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,778
Scott: Yay Petal Bismol.

329
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:07,379
Rym: Have you been still taking that?

330
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:08,599
Scott: No, I took it once.

331
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,900
Scott: And I barely ate anything.

332
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,220
Scott: Remember?

333
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:13,420
Scott: What did I eat since then?

334
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,679
Rym: I ate- Well, we went to the Indian place for dinner and all you ate was like one piece of bread.

335
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,120
Scott: No, I ate like three pieces of bread and a mango lassi.

336
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:19,800
Rym: Yeah.

337
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:20,940
Rym: It was real thin bread though.

338
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:24,899
Scott: And I had a muffin and some toast and French toast.

339
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:26,338
Scott: Lots of bread.

340
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,260
Rym: Of course, then today we had the food.

341
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:31,080
Scott: Oh yeah.

342
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,159
Scott: I ate the other half of the sandwich that I bargled up.

343
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,620
Rym: So we'll see if you bargle tonight because- I really don't think I'm going to bargle.

344
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,378
Scott: I think I'm good now.

345
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:37,867
Rym: Yeah.

346
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:38,820
Rym: I don't think it was the sandwich.

347
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:49,420
Scott: I think tomorrow, like this very- You know, I don't think it was the- There wasn't anything in the sandwich that was like poisonous or toxic or anything like that.

348
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:52,559
Scott: If I had eaten anything, it would have done it.

349
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:58,890
Scott: If I could have eaten a steak or a hamburger at a different restaurant, I would have barfed that up.

350
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,578
Scott: You know?

351
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:09,199
Scott: It was the fact that how much I ate and the timing of the eating that did it, I think it was very much a condition from before that caused it.

352
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:23,000
Rym: Now I like how when any one of us woke up because I was asleep in my giant bed and Pete was asleep on the giant futon and Alex was asleep on my giant uncomfortable chair because my room was very large and the door was shut and locked and the air conditioning was on.

353
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,259
Rym: So we had no idea this happened.

354
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:25,220
Scott: Nope.

355
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:28,700
Scott: The first time- If I didn't say anything, they would have thought the streak was alive.

356
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,919
Scott: The first time he sees any of us- I could have lied about it and kept on.

357
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,000
Scott: So if anyone questions my honesty again, they can shove it.

358
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,660
Rym: The first thing he says to me when I wake up is, "Rym, the streak is over.

359
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:39,379
Rym: I bargled.

360
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,268
Rym: I bargled all

361
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:40,732
Rym: night.".

362
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:41,934
Rym: And I was like,

363
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:42,037
Rym: "What?".

364
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:42,840
Scott: It wasn't all night.

365
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,460
Scott: That's not what I said.

366
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,340
Rym: You said something like that.

367
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,195
Rym: You were like, "I bargled last

368
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:45,440
Rym: night.".

369
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,052
Scott: That's what I said.

370
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:55,955
Rym: And I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick
