1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,011
Rym: It's Monday, December 7th, 2020.

2
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:12,452
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,319
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights.

4
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:21,799
Rym: tonight We are talking about putting your technology on life support how to ring the most out of it.

5
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:24,598
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:34,619
Rym: So it's uh, it is finally too cold for me to just go running outside Like I usually do I really.

7
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:37,730
Rym: I push it later into the season, but it's just too cold.

8
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:44,673
Rym: I guess I could put on a bunch of like spandex and gear and go out there and a hat but That's a pain.

9
00:00:44,974 --> 00:00:49,190
Rym: So I've moved to ride my bike to nowhere like you've been biking to nowhere.

10
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,696
Scott: Yeah, bike to nowhere.

11
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:51,198
Scott: You should do it.

12
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:54,290
Scott: if you I guess your bike to nowhere isn't gonna be Swift compatible.

13
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,137
Scott: We can't bike to nowhere together.

14
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:05,050
Rym: Oh hell no plus the kind of biking I'm doing is Mostly either on it for an hour doing intervals the whole hour or like spin class type stuff.

15
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,678
Rym: So I'm watching Netflix shows.

16
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:07,462
Scott: It does that.

17
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,151
Rym: Yeah, but that's all I do Hmm.

18
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:12,300
Rym: So what I'm doing is I'm watching like.

19
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:17,025
Rym: I'm watching shows that I'm interested in but not super interested in.

20
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,463
Scott: But aren't there shows you're super interested in that?

21
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,553
Rym: you haven't watched shows I'm super interested in.

22
00:01:22,593 --> 00:01:23,235
Rym: I'll watch like.

23
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:28,290
Rym: I'll sit down like with dinner or like with a drink and watch is a dedicated event.

24
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:33,310
Rym: But this is like I'll watch a whole episode of the old unsolved mysteries while I'm biking.

25
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:40,996
Rym: So I started watching the Queen's Gambit and it's pretty good and it portrays chess very accurately Which I'm very happy about.

26
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,343
Rym: I can't I am.

27
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:45,098
Scott: it's hard to portray chess Inaccurately, right?

28
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:59,830
Rym: Yeah, this is not too much to it but I guess I just noticed a trend in the last like five or five fish years where When there's a show on like one of these streaming services Like what are those shows that's made in the modern pipeline?

29
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:06,575
Rym: Like not a broadcast TV show and it portrays like games of any kind For whatever's changed.

30
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:15,222
Rym: They're definitely getting someone who knows at least one thing about the game That's gonna appear to make sure that they don't portray it completely stupidly.

31
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:26,150
Rym: and I've just noticed that generally in media Which is a big change from like 10 or 15 years ago We're like if a video game appeared in a show, it would always be like super fake II.

32
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:29,760
Scott: Don't know if people remember this but it was a big deal.

33
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:51,030
Scott: for a very short amount of time there was a TV show that For some reason decided to have the characters on the TV show Playing that runner there must have been some nerd on the cast of the show or the staff or some of the production staff Something like that that there was a scene in which the the people on the show are playing netrunner.

34
00:02:51,131 --> 00:03:17,241
Scott: I don't think fantasy flight had anything to do with it because There were some Netrunner friends I had in New York who are basically like went there Right to be extras in the background playing netrunner at the netrunner tournament and also to consult them So that the dialogue of the very brief scene Was not, you know way off the mark.

35
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:21,275
Scott: so you can probably on YouTube search I forget which TV show it was.

36
00:03:21,316 --> 00:03:35,768
Scott: it was some live-action TV show and you can hear some TV actors saying netrunner words playing netrunner cards And maybe see some people I know in like one second of footage in the background or something.

37
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,170
Scott: I don't know.

38
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:36,607
Scott: Yep

39
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:50,386
Rym: I just remember back to like the 90s the 2000s like a video game would be in a show and you'd see like and like an Adam Sandler or someone just like Randomly mashing the shit out of a controller and they'd show a fake video game on the screen.

40
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:53,769
Rym: for like a second Times have changed.

41
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:55,493
Rym: So it's Monday.

42
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:56,316
Rym: It's tech news day.

43
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:59,206
Rym: We can't quite do a tech news round up.

44
00:03:59,286 --> 00:03:59,567
Rym: Yes.

45
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:00,048
Scott: Here it is.

46
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:00,430
Scott: It's on.

47
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:02,713
Scott: It's on YouTube.

48
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:03,495
Scott: It's it's the.

49
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:10,019
Scott: the title of the video is billions netrunner Taylor and Oscar Langster at S3e5.

50
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,993
Scott: so I don't know I found it.

51
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:12,233
Rym: Yep.

52
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,462
Scott: Yeah, so whatever that that's it.

53
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:15,104
Scott: That's the scene.

54
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:16,690
Scott: It's one minute and 35 seconds long.

55
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:19,887
Rym: Alright, so some Monday you got any news.

56
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,337
Scott: Yeah, so let's start with this tiny news, right?

57
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:25,062
Scott: We all know apples m1 chip.

58
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,346
Scott: We've talked about it to death.

59
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:29,898
Scott: the rumor You know seems like a true rumor.

60
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:31,142
Scott: It's not an outrageous rumor.

61
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:32,366
Scott: It's more like a thing.

62
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:33,530
Scott: That would be common sense.

63
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:39,122
Scott: it's like yeah, I figured that out for myself, but now people are Officially rumor ring it.

64
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:44,290
Scott: Yeah They're they're rumor ring a specific more specific detail.

65
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:50,452
Rym: There's a difference between yeah, that makes sense versus I heard specifically they're doing it Exactly.

66
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:58,815
Scott: So the specific thing that people are saying is that obviously they put the m1 into the MacBook Pro and Into the Mac mini.

67
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,210
Scott: well that leaves your iMac and your Mac Pro, right?

68
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:05,050
Scott: And maybe oh and they also put it in the MacBook Air, right?

69
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,885
Scott: So at least the iMac and the Mac Pro still running x86, you know They're gonna get ARM chips next round, right?

70
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:12,690
Scott: It's like obvious.

71
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:27,688
Scott: But the rumor the specific rumor is that probably the Mac Pro is gonna have some ARM chip with possibly 32 cores High performance ones in it.

72
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:30,295
Scott: That is going to.

73
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:37,637
Scott: if true and if the single core performance on that is quite strong I think you could finally cuz.

74
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:42,454
Scott: up until now the Mac Pro has always been a bad investment.

75
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,829
Scott: money wise right cost a fortune.

76
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:51,550
Rym: and Even though it is quite strong and as it is it are stronger than the market when it comes out.

77
00:05:51,771 --> 00:06:06,785
Scott: Not all aspects are some of them But if you look at it when it comes out like the day it comes out if you put it right up against Build your own Intel PC at home Right, it not only is like not too far ahead of that.

78
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,356
Scott: performance wise if it's ahead at all And it's way ahead of it.

79
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:18,950
Scott: price wise it's like oh I could buy two computers of GT 3080s assuming I could get one instead of buying one Mac Pro.

80
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:24,210
Rym: Yeah, 3080 MSRP not that expensive for how powerful it is, right exactly?

81
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:32,274
Scott: So but if that chip has 32 high performance cores in it That may.

82
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:37,470
Scott: that's taking like enterprise hardware and putting it in consumer tech, right?

83
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:44,279
Scott: There are existing like arm server CPUs you can get like I forget what they're called There's like the end something or whatever.

84
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:50,086
Scott: that are really ridiculous CPUs that you're never going to buy because there's nothing you could run on them at home.

85
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:56,369
Rym: that makes sense for you Yeah, and usually those kinds of chips have a way lower clock speed because they're doing a very different kind of task.

86
00:06:57,054 --> 00:07:11,104
Scott: yeah, but the point is if You could get that kind of like, you know enterprise power onto your desk then the five to $10,000 price range of the Mac Pro with that chip in it begins to make sense.

87
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:26,878
Rym: Yeah, anyone who actually needs Ludicrous performance and at that point like the only thing we're really lacking here is the ability to put our real GPU in one Of these m1s, right and at that point you also Begin to stop caring about the fact.

88
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:31,030
Scott: the major downside of the Mac is that it does not run all software ever created.

89
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,156
Scott: Yeah, right which Windows does.

90
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:38,010
Scott: but if Apple can push performance hard enough, right?

91
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:47,508
Scott: We're already seeing that they can run old x86 OS X apps with their Rosetta Sometimes, you know faster or almost as fast as they did on x86.

92
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:51,429
Scott: Yeah, you could just emulate a whole goddamn Windows PC.

93
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:55,360
Scott: Just right and not even give a shit call me.

94
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:05,575
Rym: when like a premier like CP a hundred percent CPU No GPU possible effect renders faster on one of these m1s Then I could see you I had.

95
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:12,758
Scott: I can see a future years from now where even the windows person It's like well all these pcs suck ass.

96
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:16,070
Scott: I'm gonna buy the Mac because it's the most powerful PC on earth.

97
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,570
Scott: Yeah, and then I'm in a virtual machine.

98
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,946
Scott: I'll put Windows 10 and it's gonna be faster than any Windows 10 PC you've ever had.

99
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:27,498
Scott: in a virtual machine You can just play counter-strike in it you.

100
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:30,310
Scott: it's faster than counter-strike on the windows.

101
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,510
Scott: It's natively and that's the end of it right and you run all your software ever.

102
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:38,948
Rym: I'm still just very cautious here because these benchmarks are synthetic.

103
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:41,585
Scott: All benchmarks isn't?

104
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,049
Scott: they are.

105
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,590
Rym: But for example, what kind of like stutter latency is there in the emulation layer?

106
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:53,142
Rym: What about like very CPU intensive that require a high like?

107
00:08:53,162 --> 00:09:00,190
Scott: there's a lot of unknowns around gaming in particular Yes, but what we're seeing is that in the arm?

108
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,710
Scott: Architecture world where it's especially not, you know mobile CPUs and also the server CP.

109
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,984
Rym: You know the vast majority of computing usage like gaming is kind of an edge niche case.

110
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:24,923
Scott: We are seeing big Performance gains right like 20 30 percent, you know generation on generation right like they're moving Whereas x86 is not moving, you know AMD's making some gains.

111
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:27,390
Scott: Intel dropped the ball a few years ago.

112
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:33,428
Scott: Yeah But it's like x86 is not, you know getting the rock up the hill.

113
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:37,061
Rym: Yep It's tricky though because that said there was an era.

114
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,048
Rym: now the difference was no one was moving off of x86.

115
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:48,550
Rym: But remember back when there were alpha chips You could run Windows NT at like 500 megahertz and a normal like x86 chip could only run like hundred.

116
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:51,004
Scott: Oh the power PC like chips from yeah.

117
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:52,130
Rym: Yeah all those eras.

118
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:56,827
Rym: There was also the era where Intel just like today hit this long plateau.

119
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:08,270
Rym: the Pentium 3 Pentium 4 era together were not impressive to anyone But at that time the they were surpassed Momentarily by changes in technology.

120
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:16,909
Rym: But then they basically whatever they were up to either it was skunkworks R&D or some product managers said oh shit I guess we got to start like advancing again.

121
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:19,708
Rym: They suddenly just blew everyone out of the water again out of no.

122
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,860
Scott: Yeah, there was you know, they're very various reasons for that.

123
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:28,686
Scott: But yes, it's true there could all there's never ever in any technology area.

124
00:10:29,592 --> 00:10:29,893
Scott: Right.

125
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:39,770
Scott: think that any one company or platform is like the winner forever We're talking about it could become the winner because it's currently not the winner.

126
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,939
Rym: x86 lasted a long time.

127
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:51,610
Rym: what we don't know now is if x86 Can continue to scale on hardware or if the paradigm shift to a different instruction set is the only way?

128
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,896
Rym: To take advantage of modern material science.

129
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:59,133
Scott: Yeah, but yeah, so it's like, you know in Apple right came they died They came back.

130
00:10:59,454 --> 00:10:59,695
Scott: Right?

131
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:01,742
Scott: Yeah, it's like it happens, right?

132
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:04,333
Scott: It's like, you know various companies, you know They.

133
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:07,890
Scott: they look like they're the biggest deal in the world and then they go away.

134
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,335
Rym: But that's what I wanted to come back.

135
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:10,218
Scott: and sometimes they don't.

136
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,743
Scott: Intel's Google can die.

137
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,007
Scott: Facebook can die.

138
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:13,850
Scott: Everyone can die.

139
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:14,989
Rym: I mean my face died.

140
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:22,010
Rym: Yeah, but Intel has been weirdly quiet in this whole scene with Intel chips not getting materially.

141
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:22,793
Rym: You need to read.

142
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:30,237
Scott: you need to read about the organizational internal difficulties that Intel has had Disaster going on for a while.

143
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:34,130
Rym: Part of the reason why I have is that I've had recruiters come after me from Intel.

144
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:36,103
Scott: Yeah, you know don't work there.

145
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:41,330
Rym: No Recruiters anyway, but it was interesting.

146
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:42,895
Rym: recruiters were from Intel.

147
00:11:43,497 --> 00:12:04,269
Rym: it's not good, but the question I have is either Intel has R&D that is not public Or Intel does not have R&D that is not public in regard to addressing this competitor in their space and I don't know which of those is true.

148
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:14,370
Rym: and It's gonna be a material because I gotta buy to build an HD PC Probably before I can get an m1 that'll run Windows and let me put an Nvidia GPU in it.

149
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:18,090
Scott: I say this every time but watch out the Nvidia CPU is coming.

150
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:22,270
Scott: Yeah, well would not be surprised if the all Nvidia computer comes.

151
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:23,980
Scott: I'm like half betting on it.

152
00:12:24,664 --> 00:12:33,230
Rym: for someone like me The all Nvidia computer is almost a dream in the same way that the win app OS was a dream in ancient times.

153
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,501
Rym: Computers unstable run win app.

154
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:44,648
Scott: It'll actually stabilize it All right, so I thought that'd be a one-minute news, but we've recorded for 13 minutes a lot to say about it.

155
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:46,781
Rym: You want to talk about your pornhub thing?

156
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:50,249
Rym: Oh Yeah, so actually pretty big deal.

157
00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:53,341
Scott: Well, so this is old news right?

158
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:53,763
Scott: is that?

159
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:56,694
Scott: you know, if you're in the porn business Specifically, right?

160
00:12:56,815 --> 00:13:10,668
Scott: Obviously if you're in the drug business you have even it's even harder, but yeah Opioids apparently, but if you are selling sex Right, whether it is a you're doing it morally and correctly and legally or not.

161
00:13:12,212 --> 00:13:14,158
Scott: It's very hard to collect money right.

162
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,094
Scott: American Express, right will not let you Use them like.

163
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:28,489
Scott: they will not let you accept American Express cards if you're running like, you know Even a legitimate perfectly legal, you know sex business.

164
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:29,996
Rym: now This is porn website like.

165
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,691
Rym: sex work should not be criminalized like this whole Exactly.

166
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:40,454
Rym: This whole space has a lot of buried leads and assumptions that shouldn't necessarily be assumptions Exactly.

167
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:44,010
Scott: We I support the decriminalization of sex work.

168
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:48,990
Scott: This is what and I this is basically what sex workers have said that I see on and follow on the internet, right?

169
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,430
Scott: They want it to be decriminalized not legalized.

170
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:56,843
Scott: Right, which is different right from being decriminalized.

171
00:13:56,883 --> 00:13:57,024
Rym: Yep.

172
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:06,990
Rym: The shortest version of the argument I've seen is that Legalizing it is a danger now primarily because of capitalism and that people will be forced into it if it is a legal profession.

173
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:13,130
Rym: But if it anyway if it's decriminalized but not legalized then people can do it safely.

174
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:17,686
Rym: But a welfare agency couldn't say well you didn't take that porn job.

175
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:18,629
Rym: So we're not gonna pay you.

176
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:32,153
Scott: Yep regardless the the payment industry is the primary barrier for Legitimate Sex workers, especially on the internet.

177
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:33,936
Scott: They need to collect money somehow.

178
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:36,680
Scott: They need a payment processor to get money from.

179
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,999
Scott: To consenting adults happen to be using the internet.

180
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:50,149
Scott: they want to do this, you know, I got no problem with it, right?

181
00:14:51,851 --> 00:15:00,760
Scott: So it's hard because if you set up like PayPal, it's like PayPal will just be like no Yeah, it's like we're gonna can't count your patreon patreon.

182
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:04,130
Rym: a huge percentage of patreon money is porny stuff.

183
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:11,510
Rym: But that's part of why patreon doesn't make it easy to find that porny stuff through their own tools to avoid problems.

184
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:13,974
Scott: This isn't.

185
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:23,487
Scott: this is less of a problem for major major porn sites Like say pornhub probably the biggest porn site that I know of right, you know, it's the one everyone knows.

186
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:29,809
Scott: Yeah So pornhub you could use, you know visa MasterCard on pornhub to buy porns, right?

187
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,843
Scott: until now Or did they threaten to cut them off?

188
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:48,910
Scott: They did cut them off but basically there were investigations allegations perhaps a lot of truth to You know the that pornhub, you know, they let you just upload porn to pornhub, which I think was a mistake.

189
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:54,224
Rym: Yeah, I mean they've take every problem YouTube has and multiply it by porn.

190
00:15:54,404 --> 00:15:56,390
Rym: That is a problem for you as a business.

191
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:59,860
Scott: That's the way a lot of porn sites are operating these days.

192
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,390
Scott: is they just let everyone upload porn and then they take down the stuff?

193
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:11,009
Scott: That is you know, not supposed to be up there like, you know the child porn Sensual pornography, which is the heart of this article.

194
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:12,734
Scott: Yes, exactly.

195
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:18,370
Scott: So obviously pornhub not doing a perfect job of removing that stuff from its own service.

196
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:21,359
Scott: So that's why they're getting cut off right.

197
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,905
Scott: so MX and not MX.

198
00:16:23,045 --> 00:16:24,190
Scott: MX isn't okay with any of it.

199
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,559
Scott: They don't do they don't they won't even.

200
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:33,670
Scott: but on MasterCard and visa We're like, hey, you know, we will let you accept, you know, take money for porn as a legal law-abiding business.

201
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:39,046
Scott: But it seems you got some child porn and perhaps revenge porns and other porns.

202
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,450
Scott: You shouldn't be having on your website.

203
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:42,598
Scott: so we're gonna cut you off and you can't make money.

204
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:52,180
Scott: and that not only you know that even if that correctly harms People who are uploading that shit that shouldn't.

205
00:16:52,260 --> 00:17:05,766
Scott: you know, that's no good right that those people some of them She didn't be in jail some of those people, you know or punished by some System that is, you know a fair justice system or whatever that some brought to some justice.

206
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:20,730
Scott: somehow those bad people The perfectly good porn stars that are consensual adults just sex working as they should be I get hosed by this right there like this huge industry, right?

207
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,208
Scott: It's like a few bad people, you know uploading some child porns, right?

208
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:30,778
Scott: It's even worse than that because Everyone else doing it normally gets ruined.

209
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:31,420
Rym: is that like?

210
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:40,837
Rym: porno's argument here is that there are the Visa and MasterCard are applying a double standard to them because they primarily work in the space of pornography.

211
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:49,322
Rym: but non pornographic sites like Facebook and Instagram have Way more illegal pornography on them than Pornhub does Pornhub?

212
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:57,950
Rym: that is not doing a great job and should not be letting people Upload the way that they do like that is a. that is a dangerous and risky business model.

213
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,009
Rym: But even Pornhub is doing a way better job than like Facebook is.

214
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:04,749
Rym: Yep, why isn't Facebook cut off?

215
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,930
Scott: Because they're not a. there's a social stigma like the whole thing against porn, right?

216
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:16,690
Scott: It's like, you know, sometimes the bad kid in class is the bad kid in class.

217
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:18,557
Scott: You know, it's like.

218
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,790
Scott: I remember there was um, remember a pup named Scooby Doo.

219
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,066
Scott: It was always red herring the.

220
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:26,501
Scott: yeah Right, and they'd be like they'd always accuse him.

221
00:18:26,561 --> 00:18:28,049
Scott: every single episode was never him.

222
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,316
Scott: It was an adult in a costume every time.

223
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:35,857
Rym: but sometimes it's like gog manga vre where the bad kid is the bad kid Who did the bad thing.

224
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,770
Scott: so they're always looking at you know?

225
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,486
Scott: It's like he was a bully and he was a jerk and no one liked him.

226
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:43,158
Scott: and you know You don't want to be his friend, but it's like.

227
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,050
Scott: was he actually committing all those crimes?

228
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,759
Scott: It's like he didn't get one.

229
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:52,728
Rym: I think in one episode he did Did not commit this one crime that we were actively engaged in.

230
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:55,435
Scott: Right, it is.

231
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:56,157
Scott: I mean it is.

232
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:59,849
Scott: what about ISM to say well other people are doing it too, right?

233
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:00,671
Scott: It's like.

234
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:01,957
Scott: well, you're it's like yeah.

235
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:04,750
Scott: Well, if you did this you should be punished for it, right?

236
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:12,360
Rym: You should face the consequences, but the fact that visa MasterCard would never ever Cut Facebook off is a problem.

237
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:14,310
Scott: No, cuz they make so much money.

238
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,302
Rym: Facebook the kovat the kovat denial stuff the election stuff.

239
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:24,977
Rym: Facebook arguably has caused more harm to American society Than a thousand porn hubs combined yet.

240
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:29,890
Rym: Facebook is totally safe here and Facebook has more illegal pornography than pornhub does.

241
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,294
Rym: That's the plan.

242
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:35,501
Scott: I think that you know somebody.

243
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:38,269
Scott: I'd really like to see somebody set up.

244
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:39,255
Scott: I think they're.

245
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:41,529
Scott: they do exist, but they're not from what I'm.

246
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:43,292
Rym: That's like.

247
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:44,035
Rym: we'll let it all go.

248
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:45,419
Scott: yes, yeah, it's like.

249
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,483
Scott: people have done this.

250
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:57,418
Scott: there are payment processors that do this But some of them are a little shady not you know, I'd love to see someone set up a major awesome Trustworthy payment processor that will do this.

251
00:19:57,498 --> 00:20:15,005
Scott: the problem is Suddenly now as that payment processor you're put in the place of all right, you're gonna police everyone fairly payment processor Or are you going to police any shit except around money laundering and things?

252
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:22,470
Scott: because that's the thing is if you are If you aren't policing anything, then I don't want to run that business.

253
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:27,372
Scott: I don't want to send money be responsible sending money to like Cloudflare Cloudflare For like.

254
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,660
Rym: there's that whole debate of should they host Nazis like.

255
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,230
Rym: no fuck you don't host Nazis Nazis, right?

256
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,478
Scott: That's right.

257
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,296
Rym: There's a side line.

258
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,944
Scott: now you've got a. you're on the hook.

259
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,150
Rym: there's a side story.

260
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:44,650
Rym: I don't even dig up a link but parlor the place where shitty people go to have their only shitty people social network.

261
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:50,830
Rym: Apparently the problem they're having is that because they're so aggressively free speech, and there's no like blocking tools.

262
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:53,628
Rym: It's filled with nothing but ads for pornography.

263
00:20:53,648 --> 00:20:55,553
Scott: now That makes sense.

264
00:20:55,573 --> 00:21:01,130
Rym: yep that that it is, but it's not just because the spam is not blocked because of free speech.

265
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,222
Rym: it's actually worse than that.

266
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:08,149
Rym: the Companies are advertising to the kinds of people that they know will use that service.

267
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:12,341
Rym: Mm-hmm right-wing not job shit bags basically.

268
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:20,010
Rym: so there's a whole ecosystem of like Awful pornography spam aimed at awful people who use parlor destroying the platform.

269
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:22,643
Scott: Why don't we go there and post some spam?

270
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:22,683
Scott: I?

271
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,348
Rym: Do not want to engage with parlor.

272
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:28,896
Rym: Nice heuristic in your life.

273
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:35,049
Rym: if someone you know uses gab or parlor as a shelter social network You should probably never speak to them again.

274
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:36,947
Scott: That's a good idea.

275
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:38,808
Scott: So you could also?

276
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:40,829
Scott: Scam them out of their money.

277
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,553
Rym: You probably could.

278
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:48,962
Rym: there might feel like if I was gonna make a pyramid scheme that it parlor is Exactly where I would sell it gonna form a cult.

279
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:50,710
Rym: that is the first place I buy ads.

280
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:52,774
Scott: Okay, bye.

281
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,221
Scott: I'd start your call by buying it.

282
00:21:54,302 --> 00:21:55,890
Rym: I mean I feel like that's how you do it.

283
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,693
Rym: That's how Scientology got their start I guess.

284
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:06,272
Rym: so uh in some other really really unfortunate and sad news the our SIBO observatory if you weren't paying attention to this is Gone.

285
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,138
Rym: it collapsed.

286
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,104
Rym: It's dead.

287
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:08,627
Rym: We lost it.

288
00:22:09,672 --> 00:22:12,121
Rym: Thank you America for our money fixing that.

289
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:14,530
Scott: we spent our money armoring police instead.

290
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:21,112
Rym: Yep, basically our SIBO was an incredibly good like I'm not gonna explain everything that this radio telescope Did.

291
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,350
Rym: this was one of the more important?

292
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:28,043
Rym: Scientific apparati that humans have ever created in our entire history.

293
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:29,307
Rym: It's in Puerto Rico.

294
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:32,650
Rym: It is a gigantic radio telescope.

295
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:37,750
Rym: I'm not gonna explain our radio tele telescopes work because that is a huge topic.

296
00:22:38,252 --> 00:22:47,650
Scott: I do know how we now have other ones right do but that doesn't mean you know We don't have that many and each one gets used a lot and is super important.

297
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:51,310
Rym: Yeah, let's be clear here our SIBO was not obsolete.

298
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:55,490
Rym: RS SIBO's budget was cut to the point that they couldn't do enough basic maintenance.

299
00:22:55,892 --> 00:23:02,801
Rym: It started to run into trouble and it got to the point to where it didn't make sense to continue To maintain it with the budgets that they had.

300
00:23:03,122 --> 00:23:12,289
Rym: considering all the competing priorities mm-hmm and it thought there was a plan to decommission it and try to save whatever technology we could out of it.

301
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:20,924
Rym: and The lack of maintenance was so severe that it actually just collapsed on its own before they could even Salvage components out of it.

302
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:23,576
Rym: There's a Sad video of this happening.

303
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:26,566
Scott: In fact, they knew that it was going to mess up right?

304
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:27,890
Scott: It wasn't like it was sabotaged.

305
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,150
Scott: They would have they inspected it and we're like, yeah, this thing's gonna fall down any day.

306
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,650
Scott: Now these cables are all messed up is this is not gonna work out.

307
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,200
Scott: It's going down and then sure enough a few days later.

308
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,466
Scott: It went down.

309
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:39,510
Scott: That's how smart they were.

310
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:45,890
Scott: I mean people who work at a radio telescope are probably pretty smart at least at some things right at least about radio telescopes.

311
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:48,920
Scott: So they knew it was it was done for.

312
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:50,830
Scott: but what could they do about it, right?

313
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,316
Scott: They didn't have the money to fix it.

314
00:23:52,356 --> 00:23:53,481
Scott: It was you know to fix up.

315
00:23:53,541 --> 00:24:01,646
Scott: It's it's huge and heavy and Fancy and unique, you know fixing it is a huge endeavor that requires a lot of money.

316
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:04,162
Scott: if you don't have the money It's like well your hands are tied.

317
00:24:04,203 --> 00:24:04,889
Scott: There's nothing you can do.

318
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,134
Scott: You just gotta they.

319
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:09,325
Scott: they abandon it basically so that no one would be around in case it fell.

320
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:10,610
Scott: and so no one was hurt.

321
00:24:11,112 --> 00:24:13,881
Scott: And it fell when it fell beyond.

322
00:24:14,222 --> 00:24:18,640
Rym: now a lot of nerds like to argue that oh We got a fun NASA to go into space with humans.

323
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,313
Rym: and like they like they have these very specific things They want to fund.

324
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:30,809
Rym: but stuff like this is probably way more important to scientific discovery and understanding space than the flashy things that nerds tend to gravitate to.

325
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:42,620
Scott: I Mean my I always I sort of say that but I just say hey look fund nerdy things Right - after you funded all the more important things but nerdy things deserve quite a bit of funding.

326
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:43,946
Scott: nor so than guns.

327
00:24:43,986 --> 00:24:46,959
Scott: do at least and Fund them sufficiently.

328
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:56,330
Scott: Yeah, the boring and boring Right, we have too many right on the right and the left or every politician, right?

329
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:03,690
Scott: They're all trying to micromanage right saying, you know, even JFK was micromanaging when he said NASA go to the moon.

330
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:07,129
Rym: Yeah, you probably should not have tried to go to the moon at the time that we did.

331
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:12,410
Scott: In fact is that he's doing it because of the Cold War and because if you know non, you know other reasons, right?

332
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:25,870
Scott: You know my policy would be you know give huge budget to science and arts and education and you know everything and then The people who run those things will decide on the budget.

333
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:34,493
Scott: I'm just deciding I have decided only that science is super important and I will let scientists Decide the rest.

334
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:35,094
Rym: Yeah, right.

335
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:35,716
Rym: There's a thing.

336
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:40,270
Scott: not try to direct them and say no no boring telescopes rockets rockets are excited.

337
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:40,994
Scott: It's just a thing.

338
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:57,726
Rym: that's bothered me more and more as I've started to notice it more and more but there's a lot of nerds and geeks out there who will almost performatively Express their like love of science, but in practice, they don't give a shit about science They care about like Elon Musk specifically for some reason,

339
00:25:58,329 --> 00:25:58,450
Scott: right?

340
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,055
Scott: They care about things that have the Science aesthetic.

341
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:02,275
Scott: Yep.

342
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:02,597
Rym: Yep.

343
00:26:02,637 --> 00:26:05,125
Rym: Science is cool is the best way to like a cool.

344
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:06,530
Scott: They like a cool rocket.

345
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:08,039
Scott: They don't like actual science.

346
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,830
Scott: What's actual science, right?

347
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,360
Rym: statistics and Boring shit, you know doing?

348
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,286
Scott: yeah, it's like they don't actual science.

349
00:26:16,306 --> 00:26:20,079
Scott: They don't like that's hard work Yep, they just like the aesthetic of science.

350
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:20,681
Scott: and you know.

351
00:26:21,202 --> 00:26:34,796
Scott: and even when it comes to believing in science, okay They don't believe in like superstitious Nonsense right, but they'll probably believe in you know, something like, you know sounding better When the science doesn't support that

352
00:26:34,977 --> 00:26:40,629
Rym: or a hyperloop they're really into hyperloop when we already have trains that are better than that Dude, like come on

353
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:42,333
Scott: Bullet train.

354
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:43,197
Scott: Let's make it happen.

355
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:46,410
Rym: So a news that happened today, so I haven't fully like this.

356
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:48,908
Rym: I've noticed something this year.

357
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:53,850
Rym: There's been a lot more news that happens like the day we're doing a show that we haven't had a chance to read up on.

358
00:26:54,937 --> 00:26:55,363
Scott: I don't know.

359
00:26:55,424 --> 00:27:01,270
Scott: for tech We all the Apple days happened like, you know the day after we did a show because they're all on Tuesdays.

360
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:04,421
Rym: But uber there was this thread a long time ago about.

361
00:27:04,662 --> 00:27:10,050
Rym: uber is exploiting workers For his business model like we know they've been doing that since day one.

362
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:20,789
Rym: They're devil cars But their long-term play was to also invest in self-driving cars to eventually not even have to exploit workers and just fuck Everybody over like that was their plan.

363
00:27:21,632 --> 00:27:29,410
Scott: That way, you know on the one hand that's Bad because it puts the drivers out of work in a society without socialism, but it's good.

364
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,424
Scott: It's good because it means well, you're not being exploited.

365
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:34,970
Scott: you can you know, if we had socialism You could just stay at home and do nothing.

366
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:41,306
Rym: What a waste of a human mind to force them to drive a truck around the country further for their entire youth.

367
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:44,977
Scott: like yep Driver is the number one occupation.

368
00:27:45,057 --> 00:27:54,367
Scott: just driver in the United States the number one job driver of things Whatever it is that includes truck drivers cab drivers, you know everything.

369
00:27:54,487 --> 00:27:54,628
Scott: now.

370
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:58,601
Rym: the listener Apparently really like the statistics TDM and failure.

371
00:27:58,701 --> 00:27:59,825
Rym: That is what science is.

372
00:28:00,447 --> 00:28:01,370
Scott: That's it is the sciences.

373
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:09,190
Rym: but so that's what we all kind of assumed uber was doing and lyft sort of made a name for itself as They're still exploiting.

374
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,038
Scott: But no, they're the same they're not better.

375
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:17,910
Rym: but they sold the image of we're not going to do self-driving cars.

376
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,175
Rym: Uber is gonna automate.

377
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:22,285
Scott: you were just selling the image of we're less evil.

378
00:28:22,405 --> 00:28:22,727
Rym: Oh, no there.

379
00:28:22,747 --> 00:28:23,410
Rym: Yeah, they sold it.

380
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,998
Rym: That's not real.

381
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:24,769
Rym: They're equally bad.

382
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:31,589
Rym: But uh uber apparently just sold its entire self-driving unit to some some Aurora company.

383
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:41,243
Scott: Well, I wonder if this is a you know A lot of companies have sort of bailed out of the self-driving car game because it turns out it's not Progressing as fast as they thought right?

384
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:42,530
Scott: I think there's a few reasons.

385
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:50,529
Scott: The reason number one uber did just successfully get their law passed in California to exploit workers further.

386
00:28:51,554 --> 00:29:02,867
Scott: also, if you vote, California That uber paid for Uber is now trying to get similar, you know legislation passed in other states and places.

387
00:29:02,947 --> 00:29:03,629
Scott: don't let them.

388
00:29:04,752 --> 00:29:11,110
Scott: You know, luckily we don't have some easy stupid referendum system like California does so they can't pull that same shit in New York.

389
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:12,323
Scott: But they're still trying.

390
00:29:12,343 --> 00:29:19,850
Scott: Yeah But also so they since they have that law in place now that's gonna be very hard for Californians to remove.

391
00:29:20,974 --> 00:29:33,226
Rym: They don't need to replace the workers they can just keep exploiting them legally without a threat from the courts and also they can sell all this to some other company who will deal with all the problems of actually getting self-driving cars to the mass market?

392
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:43,549
Scott: and also Self-driving cars while a good thing and while a possible thing are even today Right such a long play.

393
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:46,360
Rym: There are short plays or things that you can't like.

394
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:49,110
Rym: uber would not make money on as quickly as they'd like to.

395
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:55,214
Scott: They're not a short-term play and it's you know, a short-term Stock market, right?

396
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:59,670
Scott: They don't give a shit if you're gonna do something that won't turn profits for 20 years, right?

397
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,516
Scott: You're not allowed to do that.

398
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:05,158
Rym: Yeah, but even more I'm thinking This I feel like companies like uber.

399
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:13,730
Rym: by selling by basically offloading this to some other company to figure it out They'll reap the same benefits if that technology comes to market regardless.

400
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,573
Scott: Yep, there they weren't.

401
00:30:15,634 --> 00:30:19,825
Scott: they weren't never looking to sell self-driving cars to other people.

402
00:30:19,906 --> 00:30:22,676
Scott: the way like, you know A car company is now.

403
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:25,147
Rym: I'm curious to see because I just read this news.

404
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:45,249
Rym: I Know professionally a lot of people who have quit capital markets jobs to go work for uber on the self-driving cars Feel like those people all made a terrible mistake because uber does not need a massive Engineering division if they're just exploiting workers with a rideshare app.

405
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:50,098
Scott: Well, I've also seen you know Just from an outsider that you there's already been.

406
00:30:50,138 --> 00:30:55,095
Scott: I thought I think there was some battle over some employees that switched Companies who are working in.

407
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:57,063
Rym: so yeah, there were a bunch of people.

408
00:30:57,264 --> 00:31:00,019
Rym: people switch between these companies But maybe they have IP.

409
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,450
Rym: there's non-competes and lost.

410
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:03,957
Scott: There is the people who work on.

411
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:19,138
Scott: this is generally like a short list of places to work on this one problem and it's The same set of people who are experts in that area and sort of everyone in those, you know places knows Which ones are ahead and which ones are behind.

412
00:31:19,158 --> 00:31:23,230
Scott: and if you're behind it's like why even bother to continue?

413
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,476
Scott: They're gonna beat you to market.

414
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:29,616
Scott: their thing is gonna be better than you and if you try to Workers you're gonna get sued.

415
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:33,770
Rym: I think non-compete agreements are 100% bullshit, but they're still gonna bother you.

416
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:35,550
Rym: It's hard to fight them, right?

417
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:42,596
Scott: but it's like why release the Sega Master System if you already know the NES is Development, right?

418
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:43,700
Scott: It's like you can just stop.

419
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,471
Scott: then you don't have to bother - it's actually a good thing Right.

420
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:50,306
Scott: don't bother to release to goes all the way through with this and release a piece.

421
00:31:50,547 --> 00:31:55,790
Scott: Oh my god You know, there's a funny story waste your time and resources when someone else is already doing it better.

422
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:06,925
Rym: There's a funny story about the 45 record like, you know The two competing formats of records not the old era with like the old 78s or whatever But the 45 and the the regular old 33 and a third, right?

423
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:22,825
Rym: Yep, so supposedly, I don't remember all the details of this the new record format was coming out and the industry did like a demo of it and The company that developed the 45 had not announced anything yet and basically realized.

424
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:23,326
Rym: Oh shit.

425
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:24,730
Rym: Someone already made a better record.

426
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,069
Rym: What the fuck are we gonna do now?

427
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:33,890
Rym: But the other thing that's interesting is the CEO of uber is joining the board of this company.

428
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:38,321
Rym: So part of this is definitely shuffling money and investment around.

429
00:32:38,742 --> 00:32:53,440
Rym: a lot of the same players are still involved in everything But anyway things Of the day, so this article is a little long, but it'll go into the detail.

430
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:56,019
Rym: If you read this article, you will understand what this person did.

431
00:32:57,004 --> 00:32:57,968
Rym: They made a tweet.

432
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:02,802
Rym: that quote tweeted itself a Tweet.

433
00:33:02,842 --> 00:33:03,988
Scott: that quote treated itself.

434
00:33:04,008 --> 00:33:05,375
Scott: So they tweeted out like hello.

435
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:10,679
Rym: Yep But that hello tweet was a retweet of the tweet that said hello.

436
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:14,391
Scott: So they had to do this with the API.

437
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:15,074
Scott: There's no way to do it with.

438
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:16,320
Rym: they did it with the API.

439
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:22,760
Scott: So they in between they were like it was like tweet tweet ID one quote tweet tweet ID.

440
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:33,046
Rym: So basically they reverse engineered a lot of how tweet IDs work and Figured out a way to guess the tweet ID of the tweet You're about to post.

441
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:34,819
Rym: so you could then incline it in the tweet.

442
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:36,100
Scott: I see.

443
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:45,065
Rym: But the way they did it was really clever and there's a lot of really really fun side effects where you could do clever Interesting shit.

444
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:47,920
Rym: if you read this it is possible.

445
00:33:48,683 --> 00:33:48,924
Rym: I don't.

446
00:33:48,964 --> 00:34:02,027
Rym: I'm not gonna mess with this because it seems like too much of pain in the ass and it might be goatsy But you could theoretically tweet something today that in the future will become a retweet of a tweet Meaning someone will treat them.

447
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:02,709
Scott: quote tweet.

448
00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:04,997
Scott: You just quote tweet some ID of a tweet.

449
00:34:05,017 --> 00:34:06,040
Scott: That's way out in the future.

450
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,026
Scott: You know what tweet.

451
00:34:07,227 --> 00:34:09,139
Scott: you don't know what tweet that's gonna be.

452
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,408
Scott: It's like the current highest number tweet is a million.

453
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:13,235
Scott: you quote tweet tweet to million.

454
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:14,319
Scott: a million tweets.

455
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:19,239
Scott: from now Suddenly your regular tweet becomes a quote tweet of a tweet that didn't exist when you tweeted.

456
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,659
Rym: Yep, so if you do it, right and you can maybe predict like how far out that tweets likely to be.

457
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:31,480
Rym: You could basically have a quote retweet where someone would tweet something clever and then notice that wait a minute.

458
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:35,353
Rym: How did rib retweet me four years ago?

459
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:36,619
Rym: What the fuck?

460
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,192
Rym: So, uh, you can read this article that actually explains it all in excruciating detail.

461
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:44,920
Rym: It's not actually that complicated and it's pretty fun.

462
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:49,500
Scott: Okay, so yeah, uh, so here's a video from Chinese television.

463
00:34:50,681 --> 00:35:02,588
Scott: for some reason the only Chinese television that seems to make it to at least my sphere of media consumption is Always people doing like wacky Guinness Records sort of.

464
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:04,839
Scott: you know silly type things I get.

465
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:14,629
Scott: I Don't not sure if like this is what they show on Chinese television a lot or if this is just the thing that People who aren't from China show.

466
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:16,555
Scott: that being on Chinese television.

467
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,779
Scott: right that share, right?

468
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,592
Rym: TV gets pushed pretty hard too.

469
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:26,191
Scott: So right But anyway, yeah, so CCTV is Chinese state television.

470
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:30,598
Rym: If you didn't know as Wikipedia will warn you if you click on this link exactly.

471
00:35:31,901 --> 00:35:41,093
Scott: But that doesn't really matter because this is just a video of a dude jumping off the ground Like a meter in the air almost right so it looks close to a meter.

472
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:43,180
Scott: that's already a pretty good standing jump.

473
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:43,925
Scott: Yeah, right.

474
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:44,670
Scott: I can't do that.

475
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,294
Scott: Can you do that?

476
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:48,188
Rym: I Have not tried in my adult life.

477
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:48,871
Scott: I come close.

478
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:50,980
Scott: I mean I might like, you know get near the top.

479
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,304
Scott: It's it's it's not.

480
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:54,389
Rym: you know, I think I could.

481
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:55,913
Rym: I'm gonna try this later.

482
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:58,360
Scott: a lot of people it's it's not the easiest.

483
00:35:58,945 --> 00:36:02,747
Rym: Yeah, I've been really Really working out my legs.

484
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:09,707
Scott: It's not the easiest but you're not jumping though I am Okay, well it's not the easiest.

485
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:13,200
Scott: I'm sure many people can do it but not most people regardless.

486
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,568
Scott: What's more amazing is that on top of the two?

487
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:17,354
Scott: He's not jumping onto a platform either.

488
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:19,120
Scott: He's jumping under two sticks, right?

489
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:19,912
Scott: So that's hard.

490
00:36:21,321 --> 00:36:22,725
Scott: But now he's jumping under two sticks.

491
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:25,714
Scott: on top of each stick our little cushions.

492
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:30,809
Scott: and each of those little cushions are Two eggs and you can tell they're real eggs.

493
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,579
Scott: because he keeps messing up and the eggs break all over.

494
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:35,229
Scott: Right now I'm faking it.

495
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:36,275
Scott: This is not fake.

496
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:42,579
Rym: now That is I don't know if it if he messed up on purpose to like increase the drama or if it is just that hard.

497
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:47,510
Scott: I'm sure it's not easy, but it's not a fake thing.

498
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,714
Scott: Like they're not fake eggs.

499
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,319
Scott: It's not some trick, right?

500
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:55,700
Scott: It's simply a matter of the fact that a. eggshells are stronger than you think they are.

501
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,460
Scott: They can support the weight of an entire hand easily.

502
00:36:58,741 --> 00:36:59,666
Rym: Well, I mean kids in point.

503
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:02,019
Rym: put an egg in your hand and try to just crush it.

504
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:06,354
Scott: Yeah eggs are stronger than you think it's like an arch right they have.

505
00:37:06,455 --> 00:37:13,799
Scott: they have quite a lot of strength in them You know, they've evolved to be strong so that they don't break under the weight of animals sitting on them, right?

506
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,599
Scott: Or attacking them or trying to eat them or whatever.

507
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:22,655
Scott: But also if you evenly distribute your weight right across that a couple eggs.

508
00:37:22,695 --> 00:37:24,460
Scott: He's not doing one egg each, right?

509
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,009
Scott: He's also doesn't appear to be that heavy a person.

510
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:40,720
Scott: It'll be much more difficult for a heavy person to do this But it's not a heavy looking person, you know, he can stand on less egg someone, you know for me I'd probably need more than two eggs per foot to stand on that without breaking them, right?

511
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:51,586
Scott: But if you evenly distribute your weight across them, no one egg will break Right, the jump just sort of makes it more dramatic and exciting You know to get it and we've got

512
00:37:51,606 --> 00:37:56,969
Rym: to tell the landing right to not put too much force like put more force than his Body-weight on it.

513
00:37:57,353 --> 00:37:57,655
Scott: Exactly.

514
00:37:57,978 --> 00:38:02,835
Scott: Yes So, you know regardless of Chinese propaganda TV the great job.

515
00:38:02,955 --> 00:38:04,500
Scott: egg jumping person awesome.

516
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:09,676
Rym: In the meta moment, I have not lit the tale of Genji signal.

517
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:10,879
Rym: I'm still reading this political book.

518
00:38:11,908 --> 00:38:16,576
Rym: Okay Our Bunch of panels are on YouTube.

519
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:20,111
Rym: Pax just posted a video that we've never uploaded.

520
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:25,714
Rym: We ran a version of the 40 tabletop games You should play at Pax unplugged last year and it happened last year.

521
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:26,900
Scott: It wasn't it several years ago.

522
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:29,350
Rym: No, it's 2019 and they put it in.

523
00:38:29,411 --> 00:38:31,640
Scott: I thought this one was from like 2017.

524
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,363
Rym: I think this was from 2019.

525
00:38:32,363 --> 00:38:32,523
Rym: Maybe 2018.

526
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:33,446
Rym: I have a database I can go check.

527
00:38:38,102 --> 00:38:49,680
Rym: Okay, but anyway it's a panel we didn't record because packs had live streamed it on one of the packs channels from PAX Unplugged and They're doing reprises of popular panels.

528
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:58,174
Rym: So they did a premiere live stream meaning a panel that has never been on YouTube before But is fairly similar to a very similar battle with the same name.

529
00:38:58,194 --> 00:38:59,740
Rym: We've done before with only minor changes.

530
00:39:00,224 --> 00:39:00,970
Rym: It's now on YouTube.

531
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:01,555
Rym: You can watch it.

532
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:07,600
Scott: All right Pax announced they're gonna try to have a Pax next year.

533
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:11,440
Scott: We are not gonna go unless it is like super safe.

534
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,060
Scott: If it's not safe for me to go to like a crowded metal concert and I'm not going to a Pax.

535
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,400
Rym: Here's what I will say and I think you should apply this to your life, but this is the gig night standard.

536
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:25,680
Rym: We will not attend any convention that requires masks.

537
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:31,373
Rym: Has COVID related attendance limitations or has any social distancing measures?

538
00:39:31,694 --> 00:39:36,579
Rym: because if any of those three things are true It is not safe to have a convention in the first place.

539
00:39:37,482 --> 00:39:37,905
Scott: That's right.

540
00:39:37,986 --> 00:39:38,248
Scott: And it's.

541
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,639
Scott: if it's not, you know, there's a.

542
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:47,220
Rym: If a convention does not have all three and COVID is still going crazy that is obviously we're not attending that con either.

543
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:51,300
Scott: As much as I want to go to a con your life is your life.

544
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:55,332
Scott: You're not gonna if you die You're not gonna go to any other con ever.

545
00:39:55,413 --> 00:40:01,300
Scott: if I just survive Another what - even if I have to go and survive for two or three more years, right?

546
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,719
Scott: How long did the Spanish flu take?

547
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:07,172
Rym: How many more Pax's will you get if you live to 70?

548
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:11,790
Scott: right if I just make it through that if I just got to Survive then I can go to 20 30.

549
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,494
Scott: How many more Pax's?

550
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:15,510
Scott: Yeah I'll be all right if I go to one.

551
00:40:15,691 --> 00:40:19,510
Scott: if I go to the know you could go to five Really working at it.

552
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:27,640
Scott: All right, if I'm so desperate for a Pax I go to one with masks and all sorts of protocols and then I get friggin sick and die.

553
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:28,771
Scott: Well, that's my last packs.

554
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:29,579
Scott: Hope you enjoyed it.

555
00:40:29,781 --> 00:40:43,211
Rym: so to be clear it if Masks are required if social distancing is required or if there are COVID related attendance caps do not under any circumstances Attend any conventions for the love of God or Satan or whatever.

556
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:52,747
Scott: We I will not intend a high attendance Event of any kind until it is as safe as it was in 2019 2018. just go and not even think about it.

557
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,850
Rym: Yep, if I have to wear a mask then I'm already.

558
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,420
Rym: I'm still in like personal lockdown in my life, right?

559
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:10,820
Scott: Of course, you know even in you know now I think there might be one good positive Which is that by you know masks used to only be a thing in certain cultures and places around the world.

560
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,420
Scott: Yep, maybe now when people are you know regular sick, right?

561
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,935
Scott: They just have a cold they have.

562
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:20,192
Rym: you know something like that like still like don't go to a job if you're already like.

563
00:41:20,252 --> 00:41:28,780
Rym: if we're already at a con and we're sick and We have to do a panel like I'll wear a mask Like before I go to the panel, I mean I can not gonna lie.

564
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:31,434
Scott: I didn't do that before but you know what for the rest of my life.

565
00:41:31,474 --> 00:41:32,640
Scott: That's probably how I'm gonna do.

566
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:44,556
Scott: Normalized people should wear a mask when they're sick But yeah do not attend a con now on until I'm old, you know, whenever if I'm sick I'll probably and I go outside where there's people I'll wear one which I didn't do previously.

567
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:54,401
Rym: probably should if I was wrong But so long as things are requiring masks do not go to things All right, other metamode.

568
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:55,467
Scott: one mother metamoment.

569
00:41:55,487 --> 00:42:02,647
Scott: So the It is currently December 7th, right the advent of code 20 is happening.

570
00:42:02,727 --> 00:42:07,191
Scott: Yeah, it's a. Basically if you don't know about it's been going on since 2015.

571
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:12,930
Scott: I met the person who created it once for like a 30 seconds when they checked out a game at the PAX East tabletop library.

572
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:24,270
Scott: But it's basically a little puzzle contest where every day from December 1st through December 25th They put out a little puzzle and you solve it and type in the answer and then if you're right or you're wrong and it.

573
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:28,669
Scott: There's a little competition aspect to it, but you don't have to worry about that part if you don't want to.

574
00:42:30,393 --> 00:42:34,957
Scott: Regardless I am recording videos of myself Solving the puzzle each day.

575
00:42:34,977 --> 00:42:38,250
Scott: I didn't upload all them to YouTube because some of the videos came out shitty.

576
00:42:38,712 --> 00:42:43,550
Scott: But I live streaming and also so I'll probably do one right after this show.

577
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:45,262
Rym: So I'm looking at a seven.

578
00:42:45,283 --> 00:42:46,210
Rym: that actually looks pretty fun.

579
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:47,936
Scott: What's today?

580
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:48,683
Scott: today's day seven?

581
00:42:48,724 --> 00:42:49,310
Scott: I didn't do it yet.

582
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:54,878
Rym: Oh the one about the rules for bags like encoding the rules of this game, basically No, okay.

583
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:55,890
Scott: I'll be doing that after this.

584
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:56,533
Rym: I'm just I just.

585
00:42:56,573 --> 00:43:00,510
Rym: I just went to the site so I could put something on the screen and this one actually looks interesting.

586
00:43:01,097 --> 00:43:01,461
Scott: They're all.

587
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:02,290
Scott: they're all pretty interesting.

588
00:43:03,532 --> 00:43:07,630
Scott: So the nature of these puzzles is like you could just solve them by hand or whatever.

589
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:12,430
Scott: But they're structured in such a way that you're unless you're gonna get an answer.

590
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:21,170
Scott: You can't get the answer from someone else because everyone has a unique input file And it calculates to make sure your answer matches your input file for you specifically.

591
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:25,529
Scott: But you could steal someone else's code and run it on your input to get the answer.

592
00:43:26,975 --> 00:43:27,488
Scott: That's cheating.

593
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:29,918
Scott: I kind of right who cares?

594
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:39,790
Scott: but if you're gonna solve it yourself You're probably going to have to enlist the aid of a computer and you're going to have to use some sort of programming language.

595
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,876
Scott: But I've seen people do it in Excel.

596
00:43:42,177 --> 00:43:43,762
Scott: I've seen people do it in bash script.

597
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:44,906
Scott: I've seen people do it.

598
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:48,309
Scott: I'm like web-based interpreters of various kinds.

599
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,910
Scott: You know you can solve it using pretty much any computer tool you want.

600
00:43:53,292 --> 00:43:56,850
Scott: I'm just using Python because that's the what I know the most and it's the easiest.

601
00:43:58,231 --> 00:43:58,814
Scott: But yeah, it's.

602
00:43:59,075 --> 00:43:59,819
Scott: it's a lot of fun.

603
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:02,149
Scott: You can go back and do the old years if you want to.

604
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:05,770
Scott: Good times even for a Jew doing some Advent

605
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:18,781
Rym: All right, so this was the idea we had for a show like suddenly We're trying to figure out what to talk about But it's related to things we're doing in our lives right now And actually we have a long history of this and it's a topic.

606
00:44:19,182 --> 00:44:25,410
Rym: I think well you'll find interesting and the idea is When and how do you extract?

607
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:30,282
Rym: Value longer from technology be it software or hardware that you've got like?

608
00:44:30,783 --> 00:44:37,090
Rym: is it worth it to keep an old TV for as long As possible until like the last piece of it is unrepairable?

609
00:44:37,572 --> 00:44:42,030
Rym: How long you keep running that Pentium 2 before you give up and actually throw it away?

610
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:51,669
Scott: right and now this is something that's very important in an era when a Repairability has gone way down for a lot of things.

611
00:44:52,754 --> 00:44:56,359
Scott: So things break and it's like well I guess I had to throw it out and buy a new one.

612
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,296
Scott: right if you could somehow keep it going Then you could.

613
00:45:00,376 --> 00:45:01,562
Scott: it helps the environment.

614
00:45:01,722 --> 00:45:05,140
Scott: It helps your wallet it helps So many things.

615
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:08,577
Scott: for you know There's always you know nerds.

616
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:11,650
Scott: on the one hand we love to be on that bleeding edge like ooh.

617
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,610
Scott: There's something newer faster better stronger.

618
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:14,553
Scott: I want to get that.

619
00:45:15,134 --> 00:45:23,496
Scott: but if what you have is still perfectly good or even if it's not perfectly good for your nerdy use case It's still good for something.

620
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,461
Scott: Yeah, it's not useless it.

621
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:25,983
Scott: You know.

622
00:45:26,043 --> 00:45:32,199
Scott: It's like if you can keep it functioning And maybe find a new purpose for it.

623
00:45:32,741 --> 00:45:34,728
Scott: Maybe you know keep it going.

624
00:45:34,768 --> 00:45:42,250
Scott: That's great Especially since you know like I said waste, but e waste is like even worse than just regular old wastes.

625
00:45:42,554 --> 00:45:51,462
Scott: It's all toxic Yeah, and it's like you know some kid probably had to like mine rare minerals from some you know Trash-dumb for something to build.

626
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:57,189
Scott: that it's already super bad Capitalism to make the thing in the first place if you waste it to buy a new one.

627
00:45:57,209 --> 00:45:59,248
Scott: now You've doubled that super bad capital yeah.

628
00:46:00,112 --> 00:46:09,190
Rym: But even still there's that there's a very personal thing to like directly to you as a user of technology Around and I used to say this a lot my whole life whenever I had a computer.

629
00:46:10,091 --> 00:46:10,753
Rym: Every day.

630
00:46:10,773 --> 00:46:26,989
Rym: that I can continue to do what I do on a daily basis with my existing computer Saves me money Because I got more value out of the computer I built or bought and I get one day further into the future when technology gets better and cheaper.

631
00:46:28,253 --> 00:46:39,488
Rym: Mm-hmm I held on to some computers Probably honestly way longer than I should have remember the era where like my computer would crash randomly trying to record GeekNights because I was Unwilling to buy a new one.

632
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:45,956
Scott: Yeah But not only that Right do you?

633
00:46:45,997 --> 00:46:48,189
Scott: do you make your your shit lasts?

634
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,336
Scott: Longer right?

635
00:46:50,577 --> 00:47:00,254
Scott: you get more use out of the same thing But the time it takes to replace a thing and can recon in especially a computer But also other things.

636
00:47:00,635 --> 00:47:01,900
Scott: get used to a new thing.

637
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,224
Scott: learn a new thing could help.

638
00:47:03,244 --> 00:47:09,774
Scott: you're a new thing set up a new thing Right it's time that you're not using the thing Right.

639
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:12,790
Scott: you're not you know getting the productivity out of it.

640
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:21,690
Scott: you're doing some meta work of setting up your environment and configuring shit and Learning and that's time where you're not producing.

641
00:47:22,212 --> 00:47:26,528
Scott: so the longer you can if you get a setup the longer you can make that setup.

642
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:39,280
Scott: a productive setup that continues to function well without having to Completely mess with it and redo it or replace things is More productivity from you another day.

643
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,184
Scott: you could just podcast.

644
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,942
Scott: if Rym buys like a new microphone It's like well podcast gonna take an extra hour.

645
00:47:44,023 --> 00:47:45,389
Scott: today Rym bought a new thing.

646
00:47:45,555 --> 00:47:50,050
Rym: Yeah I gotta calibrate everything and figure out the pipeline and set the line levels and all that now.

647
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,770
Scott: But if we just use this to set up we have another day.

648
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:55,819
Scott: It's like oh, it's another day that we can.

649
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,045
Scott: you know don't know it's funny.

650
00:47:57,547 --> 00:47:58,713
Rym: We're saying this I'm looking at.

651
00:47:58,773 --> 00:48:01,729
Rym: I got the audition screen here recording this episode of GeekNights right now.

652
00:48:02,372 --> 00:48:08,816
Rym: I threw together a hacky like pipeline to handle you being a remote But I never templatized it.

653
00:48:09,157 --> 00:48:10,019
Rym: so every night.

654
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:10,761
Rym: We do the show.

655
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:16,229
Rym: I just open the old file save as and continue Well templatize it today.

656
00:48:17,032 --> 00:48:22,669
Rym: I actually am planning to templatize it this week because I just templatized the other shows like the Disney show.

657
00:48:23,131 --> 00:48:24,258
Scott: So okay, so the first.

658
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:26,250
Scott: so let's talk about ways to accomplish this.

659
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,737
Scott: How do you get more blood from the stone right now.

660
00:48:28,777 --> 00:48:32,727
Rym: some of this involves planning a little bit in advance especially with computers.

661
00:48:32,808 --> 00:48:33,590
Rym: with computers?

662
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:39,528
Rym: Whenever you buy or build a new computer at least look at how upgradeable it is.

663
00:48:40,411 --> 00:48:43,920
Rym: Where in the cycle of technology advancement is it right now?

664
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:47,630
Rym: does it have two slots for RAM or four slots for RAM?

665
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:54,010
Rym: Like those are things that if you look at that early that is how I have milked computers for so long in my life.

666
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:58,490
Rym: I'll buy something and even if I'm trying to save money it has four dim slots.

667
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:11,596
Rym: I'll buy one stick of RAM to stick in it so that later I can buy a second large stick as opposed to buying four small sticks And then I have to buy all new RAM when I want to replace it.

668
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:16,810
Scott: little things like that add up All right, so the first thing you want to do is go and listen.

669
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:21,070
Scott: We've done two episodes of GeekNights on computer maintenance.

670
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:25,970
Scott: We did one in 06 and we did one in 2020. right so that's just for computers.

671
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:30,863
Scott: But the general topic of maintenance applies to everything right.

672
00:49:30,903 --> 00:49:39,690
Scott: everything that you have in your whole house from like Sharpening your kitchen knives to you know just cleaning shit watering your plants.

673
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,418
Rym: Yeah, if your computer's full of dust.

674
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:44,675
Rym: It's slower than it would otherwise be Right.

675
00:49:44,957 --> 00:49:49,396
Scott: maintenance takes time and it takes effort But it pays out.

676
00:49:49,817 --> 00:49:52,305
Scott: right you're get you get back for your investments.

677
00:49:52,385 --> 00:49:56,559
Scott: the next time you're spending an hour Cleaning and it feels like oh man this sucks.

678
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:58,265
Scott: I hate doing this right.

679
00:49:58,627 --> 00:50:10,781
Scott: you just bought yourself Right like who knows how long you know in something in some other department of something not breaking something not needing to be replaced something Not needing it's not getting all gross and gummed up.

680
00:50:10,862 --> 00:50:11,082
Scott: right?

681
00:50:11,103 --> 00:50:13,130
Scott: you you know you lubricate some motor.

682
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:15,102
Scott: It's like that's what you just you.

683
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:16,270
Scott: okay you wait you spent.

684
00:50:16,371 --> 00:50:26,008
Scott: You know even if you spent a long time on that You effectively just purchased a motor that you because the one that you're not going to have to purchase because the one you just Lubricated is gonna work that much longer.

685
00:50:26,028 --> 00:50:30,263
Rym: yep You know what case in point the trumpet that I'm playing like every day during this quarantine.

686
00:50:30,744 --> 00:50:35,954
Rym: I've had that trumpet since 1995 and you know what.

687
00:50:36,316 --> 00:50:37,038
Rym: I maintain it.

688
00:50:37,238 --> 00:50:37,800
Rym: I oil it.

689
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,522
Rym: I clean it.

690
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:41,090
Rym: I like take it apart and run snakes through it.

691
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:42,705
Rym: I replace parts on it.

692
00:50:44,731 --> 00:50:49,550
Rym: Buying a trumpet that expensive every like five or ten years would have been a big problem.

693
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:51,559
Rym: But that trumpet is completely fine.

694
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:53,869
Rym: it'll last another 50 years the way I'm maintaining it.

695
00:50:54,652 --> 00:51:00,169
Scott: Another way to make sure things last a long time is to buy the right thing to begin with.

696
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:05,470
Scott: now This has a problem in that it's sort of a privilege of people who have a lot of money.

697
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:10,969
Rym: Yeah, I buy a four to five thousand dollar computer every like seven to ten years.

698
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:25,737
Scott: well It's not just buying something That's way strong and way ahead of the curve so that it doesn't become Obsolete because it's so powerful and new right like buying a 4k TV before they're a thing and that way you just have one Right.

699
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,357
Scott: that is a thing But it's also buying the right thing.

700
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:33,344
Scott: so I think my bicycles are a great example of this right.

701
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:51,209
Scott: so the bicycle that I bought when I moved to the city In like 2010 right I just sort of went in the bike shop, and I bought like a four hundred ish trek $400 ish trek whatever right and The two choices were like one that was slightly small and one that was slightly big.

702
00:51:52,511 --> 00:52:00,275
Scott: So I took the slightly big one because I had like a more upright sitting comfortable sitting position because it was bigger right And it wasn't bad.

703
00:52:00,295 --> 00:52:02,543
Scott: You know I rode that bike a long ass time.

704
00:52:02,603 --> 00:52:04,490
Scott: I made it work a long ass time.

705
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:11,930
Scott: I repaired it several times But because it was a little bit too big that can't be fixed right.

706
00:52:12,554 --> 00:52:14,930
Scott: It was slightly the wrong thing.

707
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:17,597
Rym: It's in its just like a computer.

708
00:52:17,617 --> 00:52:20,023
Rym: you buy a motherboard that is not upgradeable.

709
00:52:20,043 --> 00:52:22,410
Rym: It was probably the wrong thing.

710
00:52:23,233 --> 00:52:25,021
Scott: Right it was the wrong thing for me.

711
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:25,825
Scott: It didn't fit.

712
00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:26,929
Scott: I kept using it.

713
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:41,729
Scott: Regardless I made it last quite a long time, but then the bicycles that I bought now Yeah I spent more money and time and research right getting ones that are exactly right and are ultra high quality.

714
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:47,426
Scott: these I expect to last forever until unless they break or something bad happens to them.

715
00:52:47,506 --> 00:52:48,830
Scott: right they'll last my whole life.

716
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:55,256
Rym: I assume now that the privilege thing like the this gets tossed around a lot But it's very worth remembering.

717
00:52:55,457 --> 00:52:56,763
Rym: it cost very fresh.

718
00:52:56,823 --> 00:53:02,760
Rym: it quote from We're I think disc world ring world without disc world stuff.

719
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,081
Scott: I don't know.

720
00:53:04,025 --> 00:53:06,375
Rym: I've never actually read any of those books I'm only familiar.

721
00:53:06,435 --> 00:53:07,239
Scott: eventually.

722
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:22,662
Rym: I know I know that Terry Pratchett wrote disc world But there's that Vimes next Economic fairness where if the cheap boots are affordable, but they wear out every couple of years No one poor can afford expensive boots, but expensive boots last forever.

723
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:34,224
Rym: It is more expensive to be poor exactly and that is that applies to technology to like Trying to keep using Adobe like cs4 in the mind.

724
00:53:34,304 --> 00:53:36,349
Rym: I know people are using cs4 to this day.

725
00:53:37,571 --> 00:53:42,430
Rym: That is causing more pain and anguish and difficulty than the cost of buying new software.

726
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,600
Rym: But that's what you got in some cases.

727
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,393
Scott: Yeah, if you don't I mean, it's like yeah They had.

728
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:50,850
Scott: the thing is you know it's like they got choices.

729
00:53:51,030 --> 00:54:00,438
Scott: They can keep using what they got which costs pain anguish and difficulty and time or they can use this other thing that will save Them pain anguish difficulty and time but cost money,

730
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:00,960
Rym: but

731
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:06,517
Scott: when you're poor you have time you have pain You don't have money, so that's what you're.

732
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:07,219
Scott: that's all you have.

733
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,810
Rym: and computing in particular both software and hardware.

734
00:54:11,411 --> 00:54:29,169
Rym: You can get a lot of value out of both software and hardware if you are have and are willing to spend the time To the point that you can save terrifying amounts of money, but if you have money those things are a waste of your time exactly.

735
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:44,870
Scott: So Yeah, getting the right thing to begin with putting in lots of research figuring out knowing yourself knowing what you're going to use things For right what their purpose is you know exactly what you what your needs are yep?

736
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,259
Rym: What does the video card do like?

737
00:54:47,299 --> 00:54:48,525
Rym: that's a very specific example.

738
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:49,670
Rym: if you're not a gamer?

739
00:54:50,111 --> 00:55:04,067
Rym: Or you only play like simple games that don't require like a crazy GPU, and you're not streaming But you want to watch 4k stuff on a TV you can get like an Intel i7 which will Integrated chips will just play 4k video.

740
00:55:04,108 --> 00:55:12,781
Rym: fine And that's enough that while the i7 chip is more expensive than the other Intel chips You don't have to buy a video card for your use case.

741
00:55:13,002 --> 00:55:14,126
Rym: You'll save yourself a ton of money.

742
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:16,072
Rym: that thing will last forever Mm-hmm.

743
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:22,414
Scott: I mean you know I look at for example a case where maybe I didn't Sort of buy the exact.

744
00:55:22,454 --> 00:55:26,689
Scott: I sort of did and didn't buy the exact right thing and like the camera department right.

745
00:55:26,749 --> 00:55:28,565
Scott: so I have like a pile of cameras.

746
00:55:28,585 --> 00:55:32,859
Scott: I Basically need at this point zero more cameras.

747
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,190
Scott: I haven't bought any camera stuff in a long ass time, right?

748
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:48,502
Scott: I mean this year because I haven't gone outside, but anybody last year either I don't even you know I guess since it's been a long time since I bought any camera stuff And I don't need any more because I finally figured out you know.

749
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,289
Scott: ah these are the cameras.

750
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:53,829
Scott: these I find myself using a lot right I you know I needed to know.

751
00:55:54,571 --> 00:56:02,030
Scott: You know myself more, but I see other people in the camera world who are buying all new stuff constantly, right?

752
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:07,950
Scott: They're constantly selling all their stuff and buying all new stuff selling all this stuff buying all new stuff switching all over the place.

753
00:56:08,093 --> 00:56:13,470
Scott: And I'm like Do you it's like they must not know and they just like buying stuff, which is true.

754
00:56:13,811 --> 00:56:19,750
Rym: Don't mean they might be a camera hobbyist like their joy in life is play with this lens for 10 minutes Sure.

755
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:34,050
Scott: But you know if you I feel like if your goal is to use the thing You're at some point you're gonna figure out What's the right one for you, and then you'll be able to stick with that one for an absurdly long amount of time.

756
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:37,383
Scott: Yep, right I bought cameras that are older than me that are still good.

757
00:56:37,503 --> 00:56:41,941
Scott: if I had bought them when they were new I could Still I could have been the original purchaser and still had them.

758
00:56:42,142 --> 00:56:45,709
Rym: which leads us to sort of point two Which is a little more directly relevant?

759
00:56:46,191 --> 00:56:51,250
Rym: Irrespective of if you have money to buy the right tool in the first place brand-new whatever tool it is that you're using.

760
00:56:52,251 --> 00:56:56,484
Rym: Learn how it works like fully learn how it works.

761
00:56:56,604 --> 00:56:59,655
Rym: learn it enough to recognize What's wrong with it.

762
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:03,909
Rym: a normal person has a TV that doesn't work anymore, and they throw it away.

763
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:21,690
Rym: Someone who knows a little bit about TVs might realize that certain kinds of TVs like one set of capacitors Will like fail and the backlight doesn't work But the TV is fine And they can repair that TV for like a small amount of money like 20 bucks and the TV is fine again.

764
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:28,341
Rym: Computers if you know what part of your computer broke you can replace just that part.

765
00:57:28,562 --> 00:57:31,430
Rym: that's a lot of people there have probably been.

766
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:37,190
Scott: Think about how much stuff has been thrown out every year Simply by people who don't know better.

767
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:48,538
Scott: And there's also a lot of cases right where people throw stuff out and people who know better are actually by policy or by law or other things Unable.

768
00:57:48,639 --> 00:58:01,736
Scott: I read it because a good example I was reading about this if you were best buy is like actually one of the places in the US where a lot of e recycling happens Because they'll just accept You know electronics there to be recycled.

769
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:04,604
Scott: a lot of the best buy best buy.

770
00:58:04,644 --> 00:58:10,058
Scott: employees happen to be nerdy people who know some stuff Right, and they see someone bring something in.

771
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,409
Scott: that's perfectly good and working and they want it.

772
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:18,870
Scott: But if they take it they will be fired and in big trouble.

773
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:22,185
Scott: So I don't and that stuff just goes to who knows where.

774
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:27,813
Rym: but you Especially if you are like a nerd or you have free you have time But not money.

775
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:46,073
Rym: if you have a thing where you need to learn this level of detail just for your own productivity or hobbies or entertainment You could have a side hustle on repairing things for people and That's a way to get more money to buy a better tool Mm-hmm.

776
00:58:46,615 --> 00:58:49,570
Rym: I have done those kinds of things in the past at high school.

777
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:52,370
Rym: I would fix other people's computers for cash.

778
00:58:52,671 --> 00:58:55,519
Rym: You know what fixing them entailed in most cases fucking nothing.

779
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,943
Rym: Nothing was wrong with the computer.

780
00:58:57,244 --> 00:58:57,766
Rym: Nothing at all.

781
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,608
Rym: I Charge the same price no matter what and I would just hand them a computer bag and say it's working.

782
00:59:02,648 --> 00:59:07,179
Rym: now Mm-hmm, like I remember I fixed someone's computer once.

783
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,395
Rym: this is a rich family that drives happen to do know their computer Wasn't working.

784
00:59:12,576 --> 00:59:15,169
Rym: The monitor was broken and I went to fix it.

785
00:59:15,631 --> 00:59:18,377
Rym: They didn't know what resolution was or how to change it.

786
00:59:18,618 --> 00:59:22,187
Rym: This giant monitor had like 640 by 480 outputting to it.

787
00:59:22,207 --> 00:59:24,757
Rym: I Right clicked in Windows.

788
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:26,849
Rym: I fixed that and they paid me 40 bucks.

789
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:31,349
Rym: Okay in the year Sure.

790
00:59:33,812 --> 00:59:35,077
Scott: So another way, right?

791
00:59:35,097 --> 00:59:41,499
Scott: So, you know now we're sort of into like this, you know Reduce reuse recycle situation, right?

792
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:47,476
Scott: So, you know you make a thing last longer, but you can also Reduce right.

793
00:59:47,556 --> 00:59:50,969
Scott: so reduce means waste less shit.

794
00:59:52,492 --> 01:00:04,969
Scott: But actually when it comes to technology right buying less stuff Could actually mean that the few things you did buy get used a lot more Which means they might break faster.

795
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:20,530
Scott: So I've found that sometimes Depending on what it is like with shoes, for example, right if I have Two shoes for two different purposes again, you know privilege of being able to afford two shoes at once.

796
01:00:22,271 --> 01:00:26,243
Scott: Both shoes last longer because like I have an inside.

797
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:27,126
Scott: It's em at the office.

798
01:00:27,146 --> 01:00:27,969
Scott: I haven't worn it in a year.

799
01:00:29,373 --> 01:00:32,070
Scott: I got like an inside only shoe with the office, right?

800
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:35,180
Scott: Having that that shoe lasts forever.

801
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,283
Scott: It never touches anything.

802
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:37,046
Scott: That's not carpet.

803
01:00:37,146 --> 01:00:38,370
Scott: Yeah shoe store, right?

804
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:48,447
Scott: It's like that shoe lasts so many years but that shoe Takes removes all the indoor carpet walking from my outdoor only shoe.

805
01:00:48,487 --> 01:00:56,795
Scott: the outdoor only shoe Yeah, it wears out faster than the indoor only shoe, but it gains a much longer life Right.

806
01:00:57,299 --> 01:01:11,005
Scott: So just by buying that one Extra shoe once Right over time that actually adds up to like more than one pairs of shoes worth of wear Right by being a carpet only shoe.

807
01:01:11,025 --> 01:01:11,407
Scott: Mm-hmm.

808
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:23,040
Scott: So if you sometimes if you buy more than one thing Right, especially the kind of thing that wears with use Maybe you might want to get more than one.

809
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:23,723
Scott: a good example.

810
01:01:23,783 --> 01:01:25,750
Scott: I might think of is I do this?

811
01:01:25,951 --> 01:01:28,943
Scott: I know a lot of people have like a joy con drift, right?

812
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:32,134
Scott: I swap my joy cons Between two sets.

813
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:33,580
Rym: I started doing the same thing.

814
01:01:34,202 --> 01:01:38,114
Scott: Neither one is drifting yet But I switch.

815
01:01:38,174 --> 01:01:41,368
Scott: I just swap the joy cons once whenever I think about doing it.

816
01:01:42,712 --> 01:01:45,410
Scott: And so that means you know, both of them are still working.

817
01:01:45,591 --> 01:01:49,430
Scott: So it's you know, not wearing one out with a ton of use, right?

818
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:51,234
Rym: So we've gone on a while.

819
01:01:51,274 --> 01:02:01,170
Rym: So I think let's end on a very practical note with a computer specifically Not max because that's a different world but with regular old computers desktop workstation type computers.

820
01:02:02,013 --> 01:02:07,170
Rym: What are the things you can do specifically to bring as much blood out of that stone as possible?

821
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:11,450
Rym: And the first thing it comes down to low hanging fruit.

822
01:02:11,911 --> 01:02:19,770
Rym: What are the cheapest things you can upgrade that will give that computer more performance an old computer usually uses?

823
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:21,509
Rym: older slower RAM.

824
01:02:22,494 --> 01:02:26,856
Rym: You can probably buy that RAM a real cheap Probably if it's still available.

825
01:02:27,117 --> 01:02:29,043
Scott: sometimes occasionally there's an ultra-rare RAM.

826
01:02:29,063 --> 01:02:30,709
Rym: Yeah, if it's too old it gets more expensive.

827
01:02:30,729 --> 01:02:30,930
Rym: again.

828
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:33,010
Rym: There's a diminishing return at that point.

829
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:35,450
Scott: Well, I mean the RAM from Mac Plus was super cheap.

830
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:42,849
Rym: But like my previous computer it had six dim slots because it was weird like it was a weird Trichannel thing that didn't last that long.

831
01:02:43,271 --> 01:02:43,672
Rym: But what that?

832
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:45,417
Rym: and well what that meant was.

833
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:52,902
Rym: I bought for like five bucks each a pile of two Gigabyte dims and I filled it with them.

834
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,750
Rym: They got 12 gigabytes of memory.

835
01:02:55,151 --> 01:03:02,648
Rym: It cost me like 25 bucks plus shipping and that literally let me use that computer for another year Before I really had to get rid of it.

836
01:03:03,332 --> 01:03:08,970
Scott: The other thing is when it comes to computers computers are general purpose devices.

837
01:03:09,111 --> 01:03:11,852
Scott: They can do a lot of different things Right.

838
01:03:12,193 --> 01:03:21,770
Scott: So a lot of people they just have a computer and having a second computer seems kind of useless to them Like they'll just get rid of the first computer when they get a second one, right?

839
01:03:22,211 --> 01:03:23,639
Scott: Okay, your computer is so old.

840
01:03:23,659 --> 01:03:25,650
Scott: It won't do the things you need to do with that anymore.

841
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,215
Scott: It won't run the newest Photoshop.

842
01:03:27,296 --> 01:03:28,881
Scott: It won't play the newest games.

843
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:31,490
Scott: It's really slow and your brows the web, right?

844
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,749
Rym: It's like my behind is an HD PC.

845
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:36,356
Scott: Might be fine as an HD PC.

846
01:03:36,436 --> 01:03:37,038
Scott: It's Mike there.

847
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:38,021
Scott: It might be fine.

848
01:03:38,062 --> 01:03:40,450
Scott: It's like doing a pie hole in your house.

849
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:44,444
Scott: Yeah, even though it's big and loud because it's a desktop.

850
01:03:44,504 --> 01:03:46,190
Scott: It's like just hide it in a closet somewhere.

851
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:47,834
Rym: Oh, here's a higher-end example.

852
01:03:47,915 --> 01:03:52,889
Rym: So my current computer with the 1080 GPU I have and everything else going on.

853
01:03:52,909 --> 01:03:59,764
Rym: I cannot handle three simultaneous OBS's and an nginx or like.

854
01:03:59,784 --> 01:04:05,909
Rym: I cannot do a Very complex streaming environment with a lot of sources and destinations on one PC.

855
01:04:06,734 --> 01:04:25,457
Rym: I could make a PC strong enough to do that But that would be a lot more expensive than buying a second cheaper computer With a very cheap video card and offloading all those other streams to that other computer Mm-hmm, like a lot of streamers.

856
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:37,603
Rym: instead of building a god PC to stream and play their 144 Like refresh rate FPS is competitively They'll just buy a second cheaper computer and all that computer does is stream.

857
01:04:38,024 --> 01:04:45,230
Rym: that allows them to save money on In the end because two good computers are way cheaper than one extreme computer.

858
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:50,870
Scott: And by learning right by learning a lot about the computer, right?

859
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:56,749
Scott: You may be able to find ways, you know uses and ways to breathe new life into it, right?

860
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,158
Rym: You know, where is the bottleneck?

861
01:04:59,178 --> 01:05:00,929
Rym: if you know where the bottlenecks are?

862
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:05,064
Rym: You know what to upgrade or you know that that thing isn't feasible.

863
01:05:05,084 --> 01:05:06,690
Rym: to upgrade it lets you make these decisions.

864
01:05:07,353 --> 01:05:15,028
Scott: Or seemingly even if you don't upgrade it even in its unupgraded state It still might have a useful purpose if it's not broken.

865
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:16,974
Scott: Yeah You know.

866
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:20,370
Scott: or there might be some way to you know.

867
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:26,550
Scott: Make it like nicer to use considering what year it is like how I upgraded my GBA screen, right?

868
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:29,350
Scott: It's like yeah, and I get it the GBA kind of useless.

869
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:32,150
Scott: I can just emulate all these GBA games on another platform.

870
01:05:32,271 --> 01:05:36,430
Scott: This thing is you know could have thrown it out or I upgraded the screen in it.

871
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,814
Scott: I put new battery in it now.

872
01:05:37,874 --> 01:05:39,259
Scott: It's like the nicest handheld.

873
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:39,740
Scott: I have it.

874
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,850
Scott: Just you know any plays anything up to GBA games.

875
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:45,970
Rym: Yeah, sometimes you can even use this to wrap around gamers.

876
01:05:46,311 --> 01:05:58,050
Rym: I had a computer that bit by bit all the USB slots one by one had Mechanical like that shorting issues where if anything was plugged into them the computer was more and more likely to crash.

877
01:05:58,552 --> 01:06:01,602
Rym: So it got to the point to where there's only one USB port that worked.

878
01:06:02,204 --> 01:06:03,830
Rym: that was the GeekNights computer that kept crashing.

879
01:06:04,651 --> 01:06:13,230
Rym: Okay, but I didn't want to buy a new computer yet because the computer was still more than capable of doing everything I wanted to do with it including producing GeekNights.

880
01:06:13,671 --> 01:06:14,213
Rym: So what I do?

881
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:28,290
Rym: I bought a USB hub and I plugged it into the last functioning USB port Mm-hmm, and I just unplugged inside of the computer all the USB headers that were having these shorting problems And I got another like year and a half out of that computer.

882
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:30,287
Scott: Mm-hmm.

883
01:06:31,471 --> 01:06:34,740
Scott: Yeah, but you know whatever your old thing is right.

884
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:43,813
Scott: so you know maybe you've got a laptop right that you had in college And it's been in the closet, and you haven't touched it right and it's like okay if you try It's it can't it's.

885
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:44,655
Scott: maybe it's a MacBook.

886
01:06:44,715 --> 01:06:45,939
Scott: It can't run big sir.

887
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:46,441
Scott: It's it's.

888
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:49,786
Scott: it's so old the newest OS X won't install on it right.

889
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:55,066
Scott: It's just really really sad and kind of man right.

890
01:06:55,126 --> 01:06:56,210
Scott: What do you do with it?

891
01:06:56,491 --> 01:07:00,068
Scott: It's like you would never use it instead of the computers you have and use now.

892
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:00,570
Scott: right.

893
01:07:01,194 --> 01:07:09,090
Scott: But maybe because you don't care about it that much Maybe you can use it when you go like you know out in the woods, and you might get damaged.

894
01:07:09,171 --> 01:07:09,414
Scott: You won't.

895
01:07:09,454 --> 01:07:12,537
Scott: so I care so much right Maybe you can use it.

896
01:07:12,658 --> 01:07:14,850
Scott: You know it's like it can still word process right.

897
01:07:15,252 --> 01:07:17,263
Scott: Maybe it's comfy to go use it for some typing.

898
01:07:17,364 --> 01:07:22,705
Scott: you're just gonna do some typing You know go take that one out somewhere if it gets something happens to it or whatever.

899
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:24,672
Scott: It's not cheap old computer you know.

900
01:07:25,194 --> 01:07:26,921
Scott: maybe you want to try to like the key.

901
01:07:26,941 --> 01:07:27,825
Rym: there is that knowledge.

902
01:07:27,845 --> 01:07:32,801
Rym: you have to learn a Lot more and a lot of different things that you might not expect.

903
01:07:32,821 --> 01:07:37,641
Rym: you need to learn about your hardware about whatever it is You're using in order to have a lot of these options.

904
01:07:37,661 --> 01:07:39,972
Scott: We're talking about yeah, maybe you got an old We.

905
01:07:40,213 --> 01:07:41,299
Scott: well guess what you know.

906
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:44,415
Scott: you can install that all we You know.

907
01:07:44,475 --> 01:07:48,250
Scott: they people are you know hacking their wheeze installing special OS's players.

908
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:53,350
Rym: Remember an RIT when the capacitors were a problem and like computers are all dying.

909
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:56,658
Rym: So my computer had the bad capacitors.

910
01:07:56,698 --> 01:08:14,490
Rym: I could not afford to replace that motherboard like I got to have any money, but I underclocked my CPU the Athlon case 7800 and The computer with the leaking capacitors was more stable and that bought me time to save up money to buy a new motherboard.

911
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:22,381
Rym: But I knew that Underclocking it would reduce the stress on the problematic component.

912
01:08:22,582 --> 01:08:25,510
Rym: due to research without knowing that I would have just been fucked.

913
01:08:25,751 --> 01:08:27,883
Rym: My computer just would have crashed every day, and I would have been screwed.

914
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:30,819
Scott: oh Maybe you like me.

915
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,488
