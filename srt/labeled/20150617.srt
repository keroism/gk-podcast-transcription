00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,469
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 17th, 2015.

00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:21,193
Rym: tonight We're still talking about Ore Monogatari my love story.

5
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:23,340
Rym: I guess just my story.

6
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,314
Rym: We don't know enough Japanese to really understand.

7
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:28,731
Rym: I guess it's implied that part.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,244
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:35,640
Rym: So this past weekend a lot of our for, you know, we only really go to one anime con.

10
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:37,193
Rym: Well, yeah really one anime con.

11
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:38,060
Rym: we go to anime Boston.

12
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:40,854
Scott: We went to anime next to once many many years ago, and that was it.

13
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:42,140
Scott: You know, it was worth going.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,610
Rym: That's where we saw rent our own sorry in Taro there.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,674
Scott: You know, it was a good time.

16
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:47,020
Rym: We went with like katsu.

17
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:49,791
Scott: Yeah, we went with katsu for the most part.

18
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:51,096
Scott: It's like we saw rent our.

19
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:57,044
Scott: we walked around the dealers room And then we were like, oh, there's really nothing else for it was a you know You know what that was.

20
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:58,715
Scott: you can go back and listen to the GeekNights.

21
00:00:58,755 --> 00:00:59,520
Scott: or we talked about it.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,802
Scott: You know what?

23
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:02,094
Rym: It was that was the last time I went to an anime con.

24
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:03,140
Scott: Didn't we do a panel there?

25
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,548
Rym: No, no where we weren't guests like.

26
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:08,057
Rym: we just went to an anime con right for fun.

27
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:09,602
Rym: We don't do that We haven't done.

28
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:10,547
Rym: this is the last time.

29
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:13,380
Scott: so anime next is still going and it's pretty good anime con.

30
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,066
Scott: It's never been really awful.

31
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:15,347
Rym: Yep.

32
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:16,471
Rym: I hear why worried.

33
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:18,880
Rym: I heard that the panel rooms are pretty small.

34
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,968
Scott: I don't think it really concentrates on panels too much.

35
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,000
Scott: Yeah, it's a typical anime con, but it gets it done.

36
00:01:24,522 --> 00:01:28,360
Rym: So all our friends were there this past weekend, so I got to see that Twitter stream, but you know, we were doing other stuff.

37
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:30,389
Rym: but now There's some news.

38
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:31,419
Rym: I didn't know until.

39
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:37,656
Scott: Anime next is making a change that might lure me back into their foal for 2016.

40
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:39,000
Rym: You can pre-register now.

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,363
Scott: Good job.

42
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:41,951
Scott: All right, you're already doing a good job.

43
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:43,419
Rym: if you pre-register in the next week.

44
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:47,077
Rym: This week it's 40 bucks for a weekend pass.

45
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:47,620
Scott: That's cheap.

46
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,934
Rym: But the news is that anime next 2016 is in Atlantic City.

47
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:53,616
Scott: It's moving.

48
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,659
Scott: It was in North Jersey.

49
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:03,096
Scott: now It's going further away from where I live Closer to the beach and it's a summer con or at least late spring con.

50
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:04,140
Scott: It's in June.

51
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:11,921
Rym: If anime next we're in Atlantic City last weekend I would have been there and I would have spent about a third of my time at the con and the rest just at the Beach.

52
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:15,858
Scott: Yeah, I mean Atlantic City for people don't know used to be a big fucking deal now.

53
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:21,208
Scott: Or you could fly easily to Vegas now It's not as much of a deal and it's sort of.

54
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:30,220
Scott: a lot of the hotels and casinos are closing and it's bad times in Atlantic City, but that I guess means the Convention Center space is cheaper to rent because no one wants to be in there.

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,692
Rym: Now we kept thinking which means anime cons can move on in.

56
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:36,100
Rym: There's a big Convention Center actually in a Wildwood.

57
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,571
Scott: It's not as big as the Atlantic City.

58
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,880
Rym: No, no, no, but big enough.

59
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,527
Scott: We were thinking enough for a small con.

60
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:41,311
Scott: by no by no.

61
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:43,380
Scott: by is definitely big enough for a small con.

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,343
Rym: But here's the big difference.

63
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:46,209
Rym: You need a car to get to Wildwood.

64
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,700
Rym: You can take trains from New York to get to Atlantic City.

65
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,849
Rym: That's true, uh, I think I'm gonna.

66
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,795
Rym: we'll submit some panels for anime next 2016.

67
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:55,216
Rym: Maybe we will.

68
00:02:55,316 --> 00:03:05,436
Rym: I'm Kind of feeling this because imagine if anime Boston was the same as it was this year except every second We were bored in between like all our fun stuff.

69
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:06,040
Scott: go to the beach.

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,719
Rym: Yeah, we were just laying on the beach and cosplays on the beach.

71
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,992
Rym: Yeah, my photos on the beach that guy who was dressed up as beach episode.

72
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,519
Scott: or if they're smart outdoor anime screening on the beach.

73
00:03:16,982 --> 00:03:18,727
Scott: If they're smart get on that.

74
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:25,130
Scott: yep, so, uh, yeah, oh but and when you need to stop to eat Atlantic City eats I mean, there's still good restaurants there.

75
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,055
Scott: There's still casinos there.

76
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:27,080
Scott: casinos have restaurants.

77
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:37,220
Scott: In fact, those places plenty of fucking hotels cuz that means some of them are closed, but this casinos this hotels Yeah, so I and most of the kids can't go to the casinos.

78
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,103
Scott: It's not we might.

79
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:42,960
Rym: we might double the number of anime cons we perform at every year starting next year.

80
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:47,216
Scott: Maybe good, you know, but Otakon Vegas, I don't know what did.

81
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:48,300
Scott: was that just as successful?

82
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,329
Scott: I think the difference is that Vegas there's no beach.

83
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,495
Rym: Yeah, I would.

84
00:03:51,696 --> 00:04:02,091
Rym: just the desert is if If I fly to this I'll spend some time in the con like doing our panels and like walk around the dealers room once rock on the artist alley ones Maybe like see a couple of panels.

85
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:03,520
Rym: Otherwise, I'm gonna be on the beach.

86
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,651
Rym: I'll even take a couple extra days off and just stay on the beach.

87
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:06,777
Rym: It's a bathing suit.

88
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,930
Rym: Yeah But Vegas I would pretty much just.

89
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,336
Rym: all all you do in Vegas is eat food and go to shows.

90
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:17,629
Rym: Yep Anyway, not that I mind that but anyway good job.

91
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:21,019
Rym: So next I can take a train dad to Atlantic City.

92
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,966
Rym: Yeah, I can't take a train to Vegas.

93
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:23,709
Rym: that's worth taking.

94
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,136
Scott: All right, so in my news, this isn't really.

95
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:28,988
Scott: this is sort of news I guess but today.

96
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:31,460
Scott: well not today actually today.

97
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:33,106
Scott: But today we're recording.

98
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:34,611
Rym: this Rym is in London.

99
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:40,755
Scott: right now as you're listening to this is in London But as we're recording this is Monday, June 15th, even though this is the 17th episode.

100
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:42,120
Rym: You've broken the illusion.

101
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,526
Scott: I know I don't like illusions.

102
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:44,248
Scott: I don't like lying.

103
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:55,231
Scott: So on Monday, June 15th, it was is was the 30th anniversary of Studio Ghibli which is crazy because I'm older than that.

104
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:57,440
Scott: I was three years old when they founded that studio.

105
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,866
Scott: That's 30 years old now.

106
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,274
Rym: Yeah, that's pretty significant.

107
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:03,840
Rym: Do you remember a time before?

108
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,420
Rym: Studio Ghibli existed.

109
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:11,454
Scott: I was three but Pepperidge Farm is much older than me.

110
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:12,759
Scott: So it remembers.

111
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:19,977
Scott: Yeah, think about all the animes the Studio Ghibli is made and now are they stopping or not?

112
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:26,380
Scott: We don't even know But that was the you know, you could almost say like, ah, that was the life of Studio Ghibli.

113
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,949
Scott: There's an important time since this.

114
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,899
Scott: really I don't know if there's much to link to for this.

115
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:39,380
Scott: I think there was on the 25th anniversary Which I guess is a more round significant number than 30. in some ways they had like a anniversary concert.

116
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:42,680
Scott: So you can just pretend that that's the 30th anniversary concert.

117
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:49,777
Scott: Nah, I think it's on YouTube maybe or something if I remember because I remember watching it once maybe a few years ago Probably five years ago.

118
00:05:50,462 --> 00:06:04,203
Rym: so in other news if you think that the war on people like being afraid of comic books was one a long time ago when the Comics Code kind of disappeared and Like people are more modern and civil There's comic book.

119
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:07,034
Scott: You clearly don't read the comic legal defense funds.

120
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:10,886
Rym: We'd like to remind you that Terrible people are still out there.

121
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:11,288
Rym: Yes.

122
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:14,420
Scott: I'm not gonna explain this and they do this pretty much in a daily basis.

123
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:17,340
Scott: Yeah basically You have extra money that you don't need.

124
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:30,096
Scott: Consider giving it to the comic book legal defense fund because when someone comes to put you in jail Because you happen to have a hentai manga which oh by the way that has happened The conflict legal defense fund are the lawyers that will come and keep you out of jail.

125
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:38,138
Rym: They have done this Yes, so basically this story however is extra special because of the complainant in this case All right.

126
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:47,509
Rym: So a school the teacher for study had some required reading and because the class Was about this sort of thing.

127
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:49,939
Rym: They had to read comic book class.

128
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:54,556
Rym: I'm trying to look for the name goes Michelle assigned as reading in class before.

129
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:55,199
Scott: so it was.

130
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,528
Scott: They assigned the movie for watching.

131
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:02,049
Rym: so it was an English class and they had to read Persepolis fun home.

132
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:04,040
Rym: why the last man Sandman?

133
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:07,812
Scott: So basically a bunch of like eyebrow comics that are mostly on my shelf.

134
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:10,320
Rym: a student and her parents.

135
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:15,300
Scott: I think all but one of those is on my shelf and the reason Sandman isn't because I read someone else's copy.

136
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:28,654
Rym: Yep, so a student and her parents complained to the school and are Extremely unhappy that their child has to read pornography In her English class, I'd like to point out their child is 20.

137
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:29,718
Rym: This is a college.

138
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:30,702
Scott: Yeah Okay.

139
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,015
Scott: So first of all, none of those are pornography not even close.

140
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:35,340
Rym: There's a better quote.

141
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,932
Scott: They do all contain our rated material, especially Sandman.

142
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:45,140
Rym: if you can't deal with our rated material You don't deserve you should not even be in college and it's definitely a probe.

143
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,611
Scott: All of those are definitely 100% age-appropriate highbrow and educational.

144
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:58,039
Scott: those are like lit like junior senior high school appropriate I mean sure, but they're there of high literary merit and worthy of any college course.

145
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:05,928
Rym: She was quote apparently aware that the specific focus of the class was graphic novels But she told the newspaper that quote.

146
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,220
Rym: I expected Batman and Robin not pornography.

147
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,439
Scott: Okay, first of all, have you read any fucking Batman and Robin?

148
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:19,620
Scott: Because you know if you see some like DC cheesecake characters going on in there you want to see some Catwoman action.

149
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:28,778
Scott: You're going to be rather upset And you don't know what pornography is because that's way more pornography than any of those things.

150
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,203
Scott: now granted It's not.

151
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,090
Scott: I'm saying I'm not saying Batman is pornography.

152
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,460
Scott: I'm saying it's closer to it than Sandman.

153
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,126
Rym: So reading between the lines here.

154
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:51,554
Rym: I'm pretty sure this girl and her family I'll bet she was homeschooled or something and I'm sort of like ultra-christian Probably and I think there's some helicopter mom going on probably all rolled in together Definitely.

155
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:55,364
Rym: Yeah so I Don't know what else to say.

156
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:59,080
Rym: this article speaks for itself and it would be funny if it wasn't so sad.

157
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Scott: Yeah, if you care about comic books at all the CVLDF is something you should pay attention to.

158
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:17,877
Scott: They're pretty much at like every comic-con you ever go to and they're usually like selling sign shit that authors Donated to that they could sell for lots of money to you know, and they're also just accepting donations.

159
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:29,352
Scott: So you should do that Yeah, or one day when you get arrested for having a comic book for having pornography Batman and Robin right you'll be wishing the CVLDF was there.

160
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:34,130
Scott: and when they ain't because you didn't give them five bucks You know, don't complain to me.

161
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,436
Scott: I told you five dollars.

162
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:40,043
Scott: I told you Also, you can get like cool stickers and they have lots of cool stuff They like.

163
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:40,386
Scott: every year.

164
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:44,049
Rym: they put out freedom comics Yeah, and their logo and everything is just great to like.

165
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:44,992
Rym: they're just a great.

166
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:46,920
Scott: or they put a nice sticker on your laptop.

167
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,252
Rym: It's like look people listen to Monday gig nights.

168
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:50,619
Rym: They're really big into the EFF.

169
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,198
Rym: If you listen to Wednesday gig nights, these are this is your EFF, right?

170
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,155
Rym: Things of the day.

171
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:04,767
Rym: so, you know anime Boston doesn't have its rave dance.

172
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:08,601
Rym: It's gone forever basically, and I just think that was nothing but a positive thing

173
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:09,545
Scott: not a problem for me,

174
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:22,429
Rym: so if anime cons specifically Continue to persist in this idea that they need to have an anime rave that they call a dance for legal reasons Why can't it at least be like this video?

175
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:25,537
Scott: So this is our actual rave.

176
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,884
Scott: I think in Japan a while ago.

177
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:32,323
Scott: I don't know how long ago But 2015 electro X.

178
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:32,705
Rym: I guess.

179
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:37,865
Scott: I guess it was recent But there was a vine of this and also a YouTube video of it spreading around.

180
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:45,844
Scott: they're playing a pretty recent you know trance hit song called ping-pong and There's a bunch of pikachu's dancing.

181
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:46,910
Scott: It's amazing.

182
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:49,135
Rym: This is what every.

183
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:55,130
Rym: this is what anime con dances should look sound and feel like like actual raves and not pretend kid raves.

184
00:10:55,291 --> 00:11:01,830
Rym: Yeah, I feel like a lot of the kids who go to anime counter raves though Would just pee their pants if they went to an adult rave.

185
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:05,450
Scott: Yeah You don't have any how many like half the people there on X or whatever.

186
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:06,294
Scott: It's so crazy

187
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:25,529
Rym: to me though because when we went to anime cons like in the early 2000s the dances was basically like they'd be playing sort of dancy remixes of just like anime openers and people would just be kind of Poorly dancing to them and everyone was having fun And then it increasingly smelled worse and worse and worse as the years went on.

188
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:29,770
Scott: So this dude he made is really nothing special to this.

189
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:38,321
Scott: It's not really the greatest thing of the day, but he made the bicycle from Akira, which is not Akira's bicycle It's Kaneda's bicycle Motorcycle not bicycle.

190
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:47,119
Scott: Yeah He made it out of Lego which I'm sure has been done before But he did it to a greater extent than anyone has done before.

191
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,889
Scott: it is more accurate more detailed more functional more music in his YouTube video.

192
00:11:54,712 --> 00:12:07,623
Scott: So if the bicycle motorcycle from Akira made out of Lego and actually rolling around with remote control Interests you here is a YouTube video of the best of that You're probably gonna see.

193
00:12:07,724 --> 00:12:11,510
Scott: or you know I mean if someone tops this guy who even really cares at that point.

194
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:13,800
Rym: There you go in the moment.

195
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,870
Rym: The book club book is the wheel of time.

196
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:22,330
Rym: We've somehow spent our whole lives having not read it a very popular and prominent nerdy book series.

197
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:24,379
Scott: We have not read any books from it ever.

198
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,581
Scott: Let's read the first one so that we can call ourselves Leonard's yep, and we're going to the talk about it when we finish it.

199
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,487
Scott: nerd cred plus plus good or bad.

200
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:35,970
Rym: Yep Also, we got some new videos up.

201
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:44,055
Rym: You should be following both mine and Scott's YouTube channels because they give two different flavors of later all the kind of tangential to GeekNights stuff we do.

202
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:57,806
Scott: on Saturday, I'm gonna live stream the Net runner regional championships from Philadelphia and and less than a month July 9th 10th 11th 12th in Connecticut.

Rym: Hartford is Connecticut.

204
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:08,224
Scott: if you can get to Hartford Connecticut without the use of an airplane in a reasonable amount of time You and you're a nerd which you are.

205
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:15,790
Scott: if you're listening to this You and you don't have anything more important to do like I don't know a wedding or family obligation or who knows what?

206
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,539
Scott: You should be at Connecticut, it's not sold out.

207
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:21,910
Scott: you can buy a ticket and go badge membership, whatever you want to call it.

208
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:31,289
Rym: Yep, Connecticut is pretty badass and it is unlike a lot of things that say they are that Actually and everything come no matter what your nerdery is.

209
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,860
Scott: Connecticut's got it covered.

Scott: if you're into gaming you'll have shit to do all weekend.

214
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:53,741

Scott: Yeah, come to the ConnectiCon.

216
00:13:56,489 --> 00:14:01,470
Rym: so We're watching a pretty new anime and is from a current season.

217
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,916
Rym: It's not like it's still.

218
00:14:02,997 --> 00:14:07,474
Scott: I found out about the show when we put together our panel for anime Boston And what do we say about it?

219
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,283
Rym: We said in judge anime by its cover.

220
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:18,070
Rym: We reviewed it based on one screenshot Yep, and a paragraph of text and I had a positive expectation based upon those things.

221
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:22,569
Rym: So now we watched enough of it to confirm three episodes.

222
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:24,897
Rym: I've watched more than that.

223
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:27,145
Scott: Oh, I'm gonna watch more than that when I get home.

224
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,290
Scott: That's all you need to know.

225
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:29,615
Rym: I'm gonna watch all of it.

226
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:31,443
Rym: In fact episode 12 like just went up.

227
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:32,206
Scott: a good thing.

228
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,110
Scott: I pay for crunchyroll.

229
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,276
Scott: So, uh, yeah, it's on crunchyroll.

230
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:40,150
Rym: by the way, I was sold on this just from the picture of the protag.

231
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:44,245
Scott: Sold on this from the picture and also believe it or not, right?

232
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,470
Scott: I was sold on it from the picture.

233
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:55,524
Scott: I was gonna watch it at some point But it got pushed up in the queue because of all places I saw on places like boing boing Things like this getting posted outside the anime community.

234
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:56,810
Scott: There was interest in this show.

235
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,310
Rym: Oh some some internet people that I follow that many of you don't follow.

236
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:05,950
Rym: They've been tweeting a lot of really fucked up fan art and internet about this show.

237
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:13,950
Scott: So it's called or a Monogatari and we already sort of discussed the name and the opener of the show But as far as I know already is like mine or me or whatever.

238
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,809
Scott: Yeah, Monogatari is story or a side story or you know.

239
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:26,275
Scott: That's always used for like in the in the titles of things pretty often like Shin Megami something something Monogatari And it's sort of like the side story.

240
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:29,425
Scott: So this is basically my story as far as I know.

241
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:34,464
Scott: in my limited Japanese language knowledge I don't know why the translated title suddenly has the word love in it.

242
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:35,970
Rym: The love must be implied.

243
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:38,763
Rym: Yeah, we would ask Emily and bring her on the show, but she's not home.

244
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:40,170
Scott: She's not home that so we don't know.

245
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:41,028
Scott: But that's kind of weird.

246
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:45,607
Scott: But I guess it's fine because if it's just my story you wouldn't have any idea what the show is about.

247
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:48,589
Scott: by saying love story You know, it's a romance and you know what it is.

248
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:55,733
Rym: This show is not our favorite kind of anime because our favorite kind of anime is ghost in the show, of course But it's a good.

249
00:15:55,814 --> 00:16:02,100
Rym: it's a good kind of anime that we like because I mean you guys like we watched a lot of Nana Like a lot of it.

250
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,670
Rym: We really like here is Greenwood.

251
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:08,329
Rym: We like really kind of show Joey fun stuff, but they have to have something going on.

252
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,575
Scott: Yeah Too many of them are just the typical.

253
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:11,738
Scott: what you expect?

254
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:22,170
Scott: kind of thing either their way perverted or their way fantasy Fulfillment or you know, there's something wrong with a lot of romance shows out there and mangas.

255
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,379
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty rare that you come across one.

256
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:33,694
Scott: That is both a there's nothing wrong with it in terms of being horrible or scary or freaky or whatever and B it is not just Stereotypical.

257
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:36,130
Scott: follow the usual expected plot line.

258
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:37,073
Scott: So it's boring.

259
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:42,430
Rym: and this show is that because basically to sell it to you before we even talk about what it really is about.

260
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:49,370
Rym: It has a typical like these people should date but there are misunderstandings and they don't date.

261
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:54,610
Scott: So it's not love Hina where they go the whole season without getting together.

262
00:16:56,191 --> 00:17:03,161
Rym: Basically that plot gets resolved Immediately and then the show just keeps going.

263
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:03,562
Rym: Yep.

264
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:04,325
Scott: Yep.

265
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:04,486
Scott: Yep.

266
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:08,128
Rym: Yeah, so good Takeo is just a monster.

267
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,595
Scott: He's not actually a monster But he is a huge dude like.

268
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:16,770
Scott: he's way tall and way strong and he will fuck you up like gigantic.

269
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:22,310
Scott: If he was a boxer, he would be a super heavyweight if he was only a freshman in high school.

270
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,554
Rym: He was in silver spoon.

271
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,039
Rym: He's bigger than those cows.

272
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,190
Scott: Like he is a gigantic powerful ogre of a man Plus because anime or manga they can draw him really really big.

273
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,610
Rym: Yeah, his best friend is this super hot boshonen guy that all the girls love.

274
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:44,134
Rym: He's a cool dude, and there's this tiny adorable girl who has a crush on him Inexplicably.

275
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:44,596
Scott: Yep.

276
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:48,050
Scott: So cuz he saved her and now she noticed him and he's a good dude.

277
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,490
Rym: So he spent his whole life having girls ignore him and go after his friend.

278
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,549
Rym: His friend wants nothing to do with these vapid girls always going after him.

279
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,736
Scott: But there's an interesting reason why.

280
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:04,789
Rym: yeah stuff very interesting reason why and this girl also Obviously has some secrets and like there's stuff.

281
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:07,558
Scott: Yeah, they know nothing about this girl other than that.

282
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:10,627
Scott: She's into the main character and she's legit adorable.

283
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:21,746
Scott: Yep in the opener There's you know, but it's not like she's not weird and she's a little weird but not no, no But she's not weird in a sort of like, you know, lowly con kind of way.

284
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:28,210
Scott: Oh, yeah, she's not like a Right, she's not a moe blob and it's he's not cheesecake and like, you know in a pervert kind of way.

285
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:34,341
Scott: it's like the character design is totally just like Anime cute but normal person and she likes to bake.

286
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:36,793
Rym: they also draw a really like cute little just well Like.

287
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:43,970
Rym: there's in the opener There's a scene where she's like sitting on this little like cushion and she's making a really good particularly notable face.

288
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,597
Scott: Yeah, but she's generally like chill.

289
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:52,030
Scott: It's not like, you know, there's no scary creepy stuff going on whatsoever.

290
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:54,182
Rym: But I mean the way the show kind of goes.

291
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:58,630
Rym: cuz you know in the first three episodes I'll spoil a little bit they they're dating by the end of that.

292
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:05,270
Rym: So the show kind of sets you up like the the misunderstanding of he's the big guys like, oh, he's so dumb.

293
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,815
Rym: There's no way she likes me.

294
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:09,623
Scott: She obviously likes my hot be showed in friend.

295
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,750
Rym: So I'm gonna cheerlead them.

296
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,757
Rym: I've resigned myself to my fate as an ogre.

297
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,547
Rym: I'm gonna make their relationship happen.

298
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:17,430
Scott: Yeah, that's it, right?

299
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,970
Scott: So there's this fairy tale of the ogre and good anime like utana always have a fairy tale as they're backing, right?

300
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:31,988
Scott: So this has the fairy tale of the red ogre in the blue ogre Which is a metaphor for the story of the show and that's a pretty good fable right there.

301
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:32,710
Scott: I like that fable.

302
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:39,290
Rym: Yeah, it keeps coming up especially in episode 4 with the fire Have to get to episode 4 tonight.

303
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:53,377
Rym: So yeah It gets to the point where like it gets just to that Bianca Tomahome like insufferable point of oh my god you tours So-dumb and then the show just kind of looks you in the eye and says no no No, that's not what the show is about.

304
00:19:54,121 --> 00:20:00,966
Rym: as far as I can tell this show is about Horrible disaster happens every episode but this big dude can save the day.

305
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:01,970
Rym: Yes, he's huge.

306
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:05,359
Rym: He makes a project a co save in episode 4.

307
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,495
Scott: Yeah I mean it's like this.

308
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:17,870
Scott: it's like even though it's primarily about this romance and relationship and these characters Right because it's about this big dude they could bring in this extra action aspect, right?

309
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:25,776
Scott: And I think that's really why the show is appealing is that it's got Sutton for everybody no matter what you are No matter what you into what you're looking for.

310
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:30,130
Scott: It's in this show somewhere even though it's primarily a romance show, right?

311
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,555
Rym: Well, cuz it's multi-dimensional like one thing.

312
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:35,694
Scott: maybe a perverted guy who likes moe stuff and I just said this doesn't have it But it's like.

313
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:37,170
Scott: well the girls still cute, right?

314
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,150
Scott: You'll still be into her cakes and shit.

315
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,190
Rym: But like you like that camaraderie kind of show after the initial setup it kind of zooms out.

316
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:46,646
Rym: Yeah, the big guy has a whole bunch of other friends and they're all totally in the show.

317
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:49,217
Rym: and the girl Yeah, she has her own set of friends.

318
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,250
Rym: in the fourth episode the plots like well, I guess we're dating now.

319
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:54,549
Rym: Alright, you should meet a bunch of my friends.

320
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,165
Scott: Yep And like all these characters got all kinds of school action.

321
00:20:58,185 --> 00:21:07,260
Scott: if you're into school action If you're maybe the kind of girl who likes to watch free or the kind of guy who likes to watch free or whatever you Are and you like to watch free cuz there's hot guys in it.

322
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:11,880
Scott: There's hot guys in this showing guys Showing guys way awesome.

323
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:12,666

Scott: you could be in if you're into yaoi's you could.

327
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,550
Scott: there's a bromance between the main guy and the shonen.

328
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:19,575
Scott: You know, there is.

329
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,283

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:22,951
Rym: You know what?

332
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:23,413
Rym: There isn't.

Rym: there is not cyber brain hacking.

334
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:25,762
Rym: Sure.

335
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:27,208
Scott: That's the one thing the show is lacking.

336
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:27,449
Scott: There's.

337
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:29,695
Scott: no It's got a touch of coma.

338
00:21:29,736 --> 00:21:38,210
Scott: has baking, you know, like baking the way that you know That one piece has pirates or the way that your pedal has bicycles, right?

339
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:44,195
Scott: So you could be into the baking aspect like I am like, oh, these are the other Patisserie something.

340
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:52,698
Scott: so when she makes that cake Salé, yeah, right exactly You know, this show has something going on But the mainly kind of anime.

341
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,607
Rym: the reason this show is getting attention.

342
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:55,290
Rym: one is madhouse.

343
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,664
Scott: So dog car is so good at making anime.

344
00:21:57,744 --> 00:22:00,012
Rym: Yep, you do It's just.

345
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:06,674
Rym: it's a show and we say this a lot about good shows where you look at it and you think okay I see where this is getting.

346
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:11,890
Rym: as soon as you say that it turns 90 degrees and you can't predict where it's going.

347
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:13,554
Scott: Yeah I mean episode 2.

348
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:16,104
Scott: I was like how much longer is this guy gonna be dumb?

349
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:17,188
Scott: and then he stopped being dumb.

350
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:20,449
Scott: if he would Has kept being dumb to the end of episode 3 I would have been done with the show.

351
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,684
Scott: Yeah, but because they got together it's like well, this is a real show.

352
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:26,844
Rym: now the way they get together I'm not even gonna spoil it is great.

353
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:38,789
Scott: So good Souda, there's the because he's so big right you can add in like these amazing animations and visual He's always like the steam coming out of his nose, right?

354
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:50,142
Scott: It's like they're always utilizing like, you know The character isn't in the environment to do sort of like actual like powerful animation Even though it's just you know, like the show - you know

355
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,790
Rym: what it reminds me of a lot actually is here is Greenwood

356
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:57,526
Scott: A little bit like the comedy plus the something for everyone plus the romance.

357
00:22:57,566 --> 00:23:03,206
Rym: Yeah, plus the school Yeah, and the like zoomed out cast of characters cast of morons.

358
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:04,390
Rym: You gotta have the cast of morons.

359
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:07,170
Rym: Yep, I mean or is that sir has that to the extreme?

360
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:14,582
Scott: And I definitely think it is the same genre as the here's as the here's Greenwood and there aren't often things in that very specific Category.

361
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:19,944
