1
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:11,880
Rym:

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,375
Rym: let's do this hello new listeners from future.

3
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:18,202
Rym: Katsucon I know you're all out there.

4
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:21,281
Rym: I know you found out about us at Katsucon and you thought all right I'm gonna.

5
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:28,369
Rym: I'm gonna follow that URL on that flyer that you put in my hand and force me to take after you tricked me into seeing your panel.

6
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:39,552
Scott: yeah maybe or maybe you're someone who is waiting to go to Katsucon tomorrow and you're listening to this in anticipation of finding out what's gonna go down.

7
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:54,490
Rym: well for the latter we're gonna talk mostly about stuff you already know but this weekend in Washington DC is Katsucon 2008. Katsucon is pretty much neck-and-neck with Otakon for my favorite anime khan.

8
00:00:54,591 --> 00:01:04,712
Scott: it's not the biggest khan but it's pretty big and it's pretty awesome in terms of what goes down what it lacks in sheer number of people it makes up for with as the Japanese would say guts.

9
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:18,847
Scott: yeah I mean you know unlike other khan's that may be in convention centers Katsucon still is hardcore going all night from Friday early when they open until Sunday somewhat late when they close.

10
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:29,733
Scott: the khan is open especially the game room which only closes for a few hours like an hour or two early Saturday morning for like you know clean up and restoring and refurbishing.

11
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:37,050
Rym: yeah you realize people that pretty much Thursday night the video game room is already gonna be up and going and we're gonna be in there playing rampart.

12
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:39,523
Rym: not you though not you you have to wait.

13
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:41,030
Scott: no not you but us us.

14
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,470
Scott: we'll be playing rampart Thursday and perhaps Rock Band and perhaps Smash Brothers.

15
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,498
Scott: who knows I can't.

16
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:53,468
Rym: I shouldn't say this but I have it on good authority that the Katsucon game room will in fact have the new Smash Brothers.

17
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,185
Scott: yeah but I don't know if I'm gonna play it though cuz I'm torn.

18
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:57,331
Scott: it's like oh I could play it.

19
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:00,086
Scott: yeah but on the other hand I should wait for the u.s.

20
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:01,856
Scott: release to govern the house and then play it.

21
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:08,197
Rym: yeah it's straight straight up for the beginning like it's supposed to be played but at Katsucon we're going to be in the video game room.

22
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:14,907
Rym: pretty much the entire car most of the kind and a good chunk of the front row crew is also going to be a Katsucon.

23
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:15,229
Rym: this year.

24
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:27,996
Rym: they're going to have this kind of mass of tables all next to each other in the artists alley and you might like to look at some of the work they've been doing because we're not well we're kind of the I don't know front of the front row crew in terms of the internet.

25
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:31,052
Rym: the rest of them are all doing stuff and you might like it.

26
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:39,154
Scott: a lot of them are making arts which will be for sale and I guess you can buy them and maybe they can make some money and if they do me they'll probably make more money.

27
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:41,105
Scott: in that con the GeekNights is made ever.

28
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:42,290
Scott: yeah that's my guess.

29
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:45,466
Rym: well maybe cuz we never actually made all that swag yet.

30
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:46,471
Scott: no we have made anything.

31
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:50,047
Rym: we'll have it for Otakon maybe ConnectiCon maybe we'll see.

32
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:50,650
Rym: all right.

33
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,127
Rym: but at this con we're doing not one not two not four but six panel.

34
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:56,252
Scott: they're doing five.

35
00:02:56,734 --> 00:03:00,287
Rym: well others costumes kendo panel okay which we are doing.

36
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,282
Rym: but doing mostly means we're going to be there while he does it.

37
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:05,631
Scott: yeah I'm just gonna kind of sit there.

38
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:07,020
Scott: I mean I missed his one at Otakon.

39
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,006
Rym: it was pretty good.

40
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,093
Scott: but I heard it was pretty good.

41
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:09,676
Rym: it was awesome.

42
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:18,239
Rym: but my job was basically I introduced him and then I just kind of stood at the back of the room and then at the end I said thank you Katsu and I the crowd cheered.

43
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,212
Rym: Katsu's panels are easy but yeah Friday from 3 p.m.

44
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:24,219
Rym: to 4 p.m live to Katsu.

45
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,494
Rym: no Rima Tashida a good friend of ours member of the front row crew was running his kendo panel which he ran something similar to at Otakon.

46
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:33,984
Rym: it was hardcore to put it lightly.

47
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:38,534
Scott: yeah all you punk kids you know you buy swords in the dealer's room thinking you're all cool cuz you like swords.

48
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:39,843
Scott: and I could understand when I was a kid.

49
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:43,969
Scott: swords are way cool and I just wanted to play with swords and pretend to fight with swords of the people.

50
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,209
Rym: in fact it's I. it's a good thing that the money to sword ratio.

51
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,507
Rym: in my life I mean my desire for swords was very high when my money was very low.

52
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:55,725
Rym: but now that my money is very high my desire for swords is very low.

53
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:59,867
Rym: if that had ever not been true either would have starved to death or I would had a lot of.

54
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,337
Scott: so well it could have not been true.

55
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:04,575
Scott: you could have had a low money and a low desire for swords.

56
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,303
Rym: I don't think that could have ever happened.

57
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:11,507
Scott: okay are you saying that desire for swords is inversely proportional to income?

58
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:16,171
Scott: well it is possible that if anyone wants to get rich here's the here's how to get rich by Rym.

59
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,918
Scott: don't buy sword like swords.

60
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,702
Scott: if you hate swords if you really just want to get rid of sword they the fuck out of an area.

61
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,108
Scott: you're going to get super rich.

62
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:33,306
Rym: I think it's more that a sword is an implement which can be used to acquire money if you are well maybe or to get shot anyway.

63
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:43,934
Scott: but all you punk kids who were liking the swords if you want to see what the sorting is really about that's what katsu is gonna lay on you when cops with his pain added at Otakon.

64
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:51,071
Rym: you know people didn't know to expect and katsu didn't even use a microphone and he was doesn't need to use a microphone and we didn't talk that loudly.

65
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:51,695
Rym: and this was kind of.

66
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:54,591
Rym: the crowd was silent and I'm not kidding.

67
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:59,435
Rym: they were pretty much on the edges of their seats with rapt attention until he forced them all to leave the room.

68
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:00,540
Rym: mm-hmm it was.

69
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,114
Rym: it was epic but the real business begins on Friday from 9 30 p.m.

70
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:25,291
Rym: until 1 a.m that is the GeekNights' block number one from 930 to 1030 at 1 a.m on Sunday Saturday sleep we are running the famous the classic anime match game that we've run at a lot of cons recently.

71
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:28,204
Rym: it has always been standing room only it's always been crazy.

72
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:31,218
Scott: my prediction this will be the best anime match game.

73
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:35,227
Scott: yet we might have to retire the match game because we won't be able to top it and have to come up with a new game.

74
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:35,912
Rym: that might be true.

75
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:36,537
Rym: you should see.

76
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:40,903
Rym: we've got all new questions which we've said at every match game but this time it's actually true.

77
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,314
Scott: yeah we have all new questions.

78
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:52,559
Scott: we probably have the possibly the best match game panel in terms of people who are skilled at the match game and we'll bake it hilarious for you and you've got a big old chunk of time.

79
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,382
Scott: is it two hours long?

80
00:05:53,883 --> 00:06:03,643
Rym: it's only an hour long but right after that for a half hour we still have the room and it's pretty much the intermission between that and the main event.

81
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:05,132
Scott: what are you gonna do for that intermission?

82
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:07,986
Rym: uh you know we figured that out actually about.

83
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:14,417
Rym: no no a couple hours ago you'll see we got a couple things planned but it should be entertaining to say the least.

84
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:14,940
Rym: all right.

85
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,066
Rym: but then from 11 p.m.

86
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,470
Rym: to 1 a.m.

87
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:23,003
Rym: late night Katsucon hosted by Rym and Scott we've got.

88
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:26,373
Rym: we've got Greg Ayers and Steve Bennett as our guest.

89
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:35,275
Rym: TVV is uh if you don't know who's TVV is he's one of the few people for whom the word epic really applies when it comes to being an anime fan.

90
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:46,753
Scott: you may have heard many things about this man but there's one thing that is the only one thing about him that matters regardless of whether those other things are true or not is that he is mighty entertaining at the anime conventions.

91
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:53,886
Scott: he's also the best match game contestant we've ever had and we will be the catalyst for his entertaining faucet.

92
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:57,437
Rym: I hope he doesn't have any other faucets.

93
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:01,251
Scott: we will ignore those faucets that may or may not exist for the time being.

94
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:04,003
Rym: but we've got a comedy act.

95
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,314
Rym: we got some stand-up we got some musical acts.

96
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:07,902
Rym: we've got a history lesson.

97
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:09,914
Rym: at the end this is gonna be a pretty good show.

98
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:11,282
Scott: I practice that history lesson.

99
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:12,490
Rym: we got to practice everything.

100
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:13,920
Rym: God we haven't even had a rehearsal of this.

101
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:20,307
Rym: we have a rehearsal when maybe Thursday Thursday Thursday at katsu-kan will be the rehearsal for late night.

102
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:21,534
Scott: katsu-kan you're not invited.

103
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,743
Rym: we're so awesome right now.

104
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:32,217
Rym: then Saturday at noon which is pretty much gonna be when I wake up we're going to have a nice laid-back panel anime you should see.

105
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:33,886
Scott: oh I thought that was gonna be breakfast.

106
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,997
Rym: well we can eat breakfast at it.

107
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:37,988
Rym: maybe we'll get some bagels and bring them to the panel.

108
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:39,175
Scott: yeah anyone to come.

109
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:41,568
Scott: this is the panel they have the lowest expectations for.

110
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:43,921
Scott: so I'm gonna buy a whole but we're gonna try to get.

111
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:44,867
Scott: I guess I'm doing this.

112
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:46,779
Scott: I get trying to get as many doughnuts as I can.

113
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,292
Scott: it could be anywhere between zero and infinity doughnuts.

114
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,126
Scott: right I don't know how many but I'm gonna try.

115
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:54,678
Scott: and if you show up I'll give you a doughnut.

116
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,954
Rym: and in fact if you were dressed up as Vash the stampede you get two doughnuts.

117
00:07:58,356 --> 00:07:59,481
Scott: no no you don't.

118
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:00,404
Scott: what is Vash?

119
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:01,228
Scott: that's tough shit.

120
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:08,057
Rym: ah but I get all the doughnuts I want because I think the past four decades have seen a lot of great anime.

121
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:09,868
Rym: you've probably seen much less.

122
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,277
Rym: now's your chance to learn about.

123
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:15,218
Rym: why are you reading the blockbusters of yesteryear and the classics for all time?

124
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:16,805
Scott: why are you reading the ad copy?

125
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:19,116
Rym: I wrote that ad copy and I'm proud of it.

126
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:24,122
Rym: great okay but here's the deal for all of you because you know they wanted us to do a panel.

127
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:30,096
Rym: well the con the con people out there the people who aren't listening to GeekNights aren't cool yet they're uh they're gonna.

128
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:32,751
Rym: I don't know what they're gonna expect when they come to a panel like this cuz.

129
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:42,543
Rym: panels with titles like this are at every freaking anime con and they're usually just stupid like it's a when you like Naruto.

130
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,606
Rym: yeah I like Naruto.

131
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:45,372
Rym: let's talk about Naruto.

132
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,342
Rym: so uh we're gonna.

133
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:52,810
Rym: we're not sure what we're gonna do with this panel but it's gonna be vaguely related to anime that we want you to see.

134
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,076
Rym: I think it'll be fun.

135
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:57,776
Scott: I think what I'm gonna do is do a lot of audience questioning of like.

136
00:08:57,796 --> 00:08:58,319
Scott: so why did you?

137
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,607
Scott: why did you come to this battle?

138
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,305
Rym: well we'll get people up be like all right what kind of?

139
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:04,820
Rym: well I'm sure there's gonna be someone in the audience who hates anime.

140
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:06,649
Rym: we'll get them up and we'll talk to them.

141
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:08,036
Scott: yeah yeah we should.

142
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,163
Scott: actually that's a good idea.

143
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:13,856
Scott: let's get people up there ask them an anime they like what they've seen and what they haven't seen and then tell them what they should see.

144
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:18,022
Scott: yeah let's do it like that instead of it's just being generic like everyone should see this.

145
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:18,767
Scott: everyone should see that.

146
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,503
Rym: yeah granted there are a couple things that everyone should see.

147
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:23,173
Rym: if you know what I'm gonna spoil it right now.

148
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:29,439
Rym: cowboy bebop Evangelion escaflown a try gun serial experiments Lane full metal alchemist.

149
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:37,644
Scott: I guess your Tana princess tutu princess too - yeah why you'd be surprised fancy lala before princess tutu.

150
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:42,301
Rym: big-o big-o - big-o oh big-o - those tomatoes he tests.

151
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:49,564
Rym: okay anyway keep going with the schedule here and then Saturday night from 5 30 p.m.

152
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:50,627
Rym: to 6 30 p.m.

153
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:51,851
Rym: in live one.

154
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:56,649
Rym: we ran this event as a test and it failed at ConnectiCon last year.

155
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,401
Rym: we've revamped it and now I think we're good to go.

156
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,510
Rym: it is the challenger on fire.

157
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,884
Scott: I'm still leery about this event but we'll for it anyway.

158
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,094
Rym: where the thing is now we're set up.

159
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:09,505
Rym: we're gonna have a good 20 contestants up there.

160
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,503
Rym: we might do things to people who are knocked out of the competition.

161
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:14,026
Scott: this is gonna be.

162
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,234
Scott: what are you gonna do to people?

163
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:15,777
Scott: you'll see.

164
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:19,234
Scott: you got some pies ready or some clown pistol clown pistols.

165
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:21,023
Scott: maybe you don't have any clown pistols.

166
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,911
Rym: I've been shot at with clown pistols.

167
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:24,477
Scott: yeah yeah.

168
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:28,219
Rym: all I have to say is there's a 1% chance that Daryl Surratt might appear at this con.

169
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:32,476
Scott: and yeah I like one point like 0.1 percent chance I don't know.

170
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:42,149
Rym: apparently the last time when he showed up at Katsucon when I met him while I was quite drunk he only went because randomly a bunch of his friends were going and he just hit your ride so that might happen again?

171
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:42,572
Rym: I don't know.

172
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:43,356
Scott: I doubt it.

173
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:46,948
Rym: Gerald couldn't tell me if he was going or not so whatever.

174
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:53,646
Rym: but then from 11 30 to 12 to midnight 30 a.m.

175
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,090
Rym: in live 3.

176
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,433
Scott: so Oh 30.

177
00:10:56,433 --> 00:11:03,198
Rym: now notice how all Monday on Sunday all our other events are in live 1 and live 2 but this one's in live 3.

178
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:07,038
Rym: I think it's kind of like how Otakon puts a certain kind of thing in video 5 every year.

179
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:18,240
Rym: I think live 3 is gonna be special because we did a panel at Otakon last year that is famous or infamous depending on who you are and who you talk to but it was.

180
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,363
Rym: it was standing room only and people applauded and only two people walked out in disgust.

181
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,086
Rym: so I can stand up now.

182
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:25,432
Scott: we know those two people.

183
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:35,969
Rym: yes if the only two people who walked out and discussed where our friends I think it was okay but us along some of the people clapping were people from Katsucon who were like please do it again for us.

184
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,437
Rym: I think the best part is.

185
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:51,096
Rym: we got called into like the Otakon staff because they heard tell of this kind of epic panel we'd run and they were curious as to whether or not that epicness exceeded certain boundaries but half the staff as we were walking.

186
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:51,779
Rym: it was a man.

187
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:52,441
Rym: you guys ran that.

188
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:53,705
Rym: that was fucking awesome.

189
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:54,848
Rym: oh my god.

190
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,435
Rym: yeah but gecky guy.

191
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:01,911
Rym: now we're going to do a very similar panel to what we did at Otakon.

192
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:11,759
Scott: however however Gerald who is responsible for much of the epicness yeah in fact told us that he wanted us to make sure that we gave him credit for the stuff that he did.

193
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,030
Rym: and though we will oh yes we definitely will.

194
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,597
Rym: you see we're not going to shit.

195
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:19,737
Rym: we we've gotten a hold of the visual aids that Gerald used and we're in.

196
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:25,198
Rym: Scott is studying and because I couldn't deal with it making a very careful study.

197
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,984
Rym: yes well I studied mr.

198
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:33,447
Rym: Tokai enough like studying nitroglycerin plutonium totally gecky goni him.

199
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:37,218
Rym: yeah but let me put it this way this panel.

200
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:40,670
Rym: you've got to be 18 and we're gonna be checking ID before you come in.

201
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:48,099
Rym: and as long as you are not easily offended by things this panel is gonna be awesome.

202
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,394
Rym: if you're easily offended do not come to our gecky god panel.

203
00:12:52,454 --> 00:13:05,371
Rym: I'm serious but if you liked ichi the killer or meatball machine or any of that stuff or if you have a feeling that everything we call this intro everything we just said sounds hilarious that panel is so up your alley.

204
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:06,415
Rym: you have no idea.

205
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:08,705
Scott: so what are we doing anything after that?

206
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:09,107
Scott: or is that it?

207
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:18,243
Rym: well we had scheduled another the anime match game encore on Sunday from 1 to 2 and live 1. but but I guess this is probably good for us.

208
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:24,672
Rym: but all the guests said we're gonna leave early on Sunday cuz you know we want to go home after this.

209
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:25,676
Rym: con will be tired.

210
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,624
Rym: you expect us to be up by 1 p.m.

211
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:27,925
Rym: huh.

212
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:32,184
Rym: so I don't know if we're gonna fill that slot with something else or not.

213
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:35,117
Scott: well we'll see the schedule when we get there.

214
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:38,614
Scott: yeah there's an event before it has to con schedule still say that?

215
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:39,539
Rym: I don't know.

216
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:40,183
Rym: I didn't even look.

217
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:45,850
Rym: well they rescheduled and the event before it is supposed to go long but we might do something in that room.

218
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,432
Rym: we'll see.

219
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:50,908
Rym: now beyond all that in the video game room you won't be hard to find us.

220
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:55,867
Rym: and there might be some Atari 7800 tournaments.

221
00:13:56,771 --> 00:14:10,879
Rym: no I guarantee there will be Atari 7800 tournaments and actually probably like late Saturday what I want to say to all of you now I will give $100 cash to anyone who can beat me at a game of kaboom.

222
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,126
Scott: I think you better watch out cuz.

223
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:14,080
Scott: you know there's that guy who could beat Marvel Madness.

224
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:14,844
Rym: you know what.

225
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:17,339
Rym: I'll say this this is one of those challenges kind of like.

226
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:22,324
Rym: when I was I was well I was drunk last katsu-kan but I was betting people money on Rampart.

227
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:24,674
Rym: but I wouldn't take any money if I won.

228
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:26,321
Rym: I'd only give them money if I lost.

229
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:27,104
Rym: I never lost.

230
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:29,292
Rym: but this is one of those.

231
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:30,436
Rym: ideas were alright.

232
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:39,801
Rym: if nobody wins then I just proved how awesome I am and if anyone beats me I basically paid $100 to find one of the most awesome people in the world and become their friend.

233
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:43,230
Scott: well but I know there are people at katsu kind of mad video game skills.

234
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:50,825
Scott: I don't think it's a good thing to bet on video game skills at katsu-kan unless you are real sure of yourself that you're God like.

235
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:54,504
Rym: let me put it this way when I was very young my father played kaboom like.

236
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:57,739
Scott: I wouldn't even bet on my Megaman 2 or Tetris skills at katsu-kan.

237
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,979
Rym: I have played kaboom since I was four years old and I've played it.

238
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:02,441
Rym: continue.

239
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:03,889
Scott: watch that guy play Marvel Madness.

240
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:06,302
Scott: I'm betting he's also good that good at other games.

241
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:10,527
Rym: I don't know kaboom that it's tricky cuz even if you're you have you have awesome skill.

242
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:13,703
Rym: you got to have some some special techniques to get the high score.

243
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:21,601
Scott: yeah don't use the broken controller.

244
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:26,249
Rym: so yeah katsu-kan Washington DC at the omnishore motel.

245
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:30,713
Rym: if you can't find the omnishore motel in Washington DC you probably shouldn't be going to katsu-kan.

246
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:32,059
Scott: and that's it for the news.

247
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:37,109
Scott: cuz I'm not gonna look up anything in my RSS feed that hasn't been read in like two weeks.

248
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:45,948
Rym: anyway things of the day.

249
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:56,055
Rym: now I'm not gonna talk about the underlying thing here other than that this is not a straight-up Mario Paint music maker because the Mario Paint music maker is kind of limited.

250
00:15:56,095 --> 00:16:08,465
Rym: I actually made a bunch of songs in it for a cloud digital audio class at RIT and this is much more full-featured but it is otherwise still alive done in Mario Paint and it's pretty damn cool.

251
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:20,383
Scott: yeah if anyone hasn't found this there's some Windows program out there that's basically lets you do the Mario Paint music making but better without stupid limits put on it by the weakness of the Super Nintendo and it's pretty good.

252
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:21,852
Scott: my favorite is the swan.

253
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:22,496
Scott: what's your favorite?

254
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:23,060
Rym: I don't know.

255
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,026
Rym: I always like the Gameboy.

256
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:28,430
Rym: I used to write like all these kind of three-part four-part harmonies with Gameboy.

257
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:35,808
Scott: see the swan was always mystifying to me because the swan is like that techno noise that I love so much but like I never knew what makes that noise or how to make that.

258
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,763
Rym: so now you know it's swan exactly swans.

259
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:40,491
Rym: actually you know it's called an orchestra.

260
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:43,424
Scott: hit whatever it's a swan swans are where it's at all right.

261
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:46,075
Scott: my thing today is super simple.

262
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:47,100
Scott: it's a picture.

263
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,847
Scott: it's just one picture.

264
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:49,911
Scott: it's a Photoshop.

265
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,538
Scott: someone did mashing up two things.

266
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:58,730
Scott: I like it's pretty simple but when I saw it it made me really happy and when I look at it again it still makes me happy.

267
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:00,259
Rym: I'm smiling just thinking about it.

268
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,967
Rym: Scott sent it to me and said check that out.

269
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:02,550
Rym: I said whoa.

270
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,729
Scott: so you've probably seen it before on your 4chans or whatnot.

271
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:09,842
Scott: it's probably mad old and lame and you know whatever.

272
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:11,067
Scott: but I saw it.

273
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,435
Scott: I never saw it before and I like it a lot.

274
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:15,483
Scott: so fuck you and fuck your mother.

275
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:18,215
Rym: that was uncalled for whatever.

276
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,508
Rym: at least go after Scott Johnson's mother all right.

277
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,196
Rym: but yeah the most talked about mother.

278
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:26,881
Scott: on GeekNights if you're liking some asamanga tiles or maybe some transformers you like this picture.

279
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:27,723
Scott: it will make you happy.

280
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:38,821
Rym: so now we I mentioned this briefly yesterday but when it comes to a show that reviews any sort of genre or medium or anything like that.

281
00:17:39,243 --> 00:17:49,073
Rym: there's always kind of those big names the heavy hitters that you almost don't want to talk about because you almost feel like you're not up to the challenge like you're never ready you couldn't do it justice.

282
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,251
Scott: or that it's so big that like what is there to say about it?

283
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,116
Scott: you know it's like why.

284
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:53,800
Scott: you know why.

285
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,604
Scott: what's the point?

286
00:17:54,665 --> 00:18:05,926
Scott: it's like if you've made a podcast right a move that remove you movies right what would be the point in reviewing say Star Wars episode 4. you know the lead hope new hope.

287
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:09,775
Rym: have you ever seen Star Wars?

288
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:11,961
Scott: yeah I was like I was.

289
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:15,077
Scott: I forgot the words before hope I was like last hope only hope.

290
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:20,113
Scott: yeah yeah you know that stop but reviewing that it's like.

291
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:21,136
Scott: what's the point?

292
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:22,440
Scott: who doesn't know?

293
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,406
Scott: who hasn't seen it?

294
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:24,513
Scott: who doesn't know everything?

295
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:31,250
Scott: what's the point in reviewing it other than you know to maybe entertain people who like it a lot that you can sort of give them an install

296
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:47,086
Rym: as I've learned from listening to a lot of movies you should see is that I pretty much mostly listen to reviews of movies I've already seen because you almost when someone else who knows about film or knows about anime or knows about comics is kind of talking about their reading of something from their perspective.

297
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:51,227
Rym: you almost relive reading it again and you like those moments where you went.

298
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:57,760
Rym: ah you go ah again just from thinking about what are you doing a Captain Billy over there I moved it yours like squeezing it.

299
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,228
Scott: yeah anyway.

300
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:05,863
Rym: so yeah the show is unedited tonight because we got a pack for katsukan.

301
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:07,836
Rym: we're leaving in the morning and we haven't done shit.

302
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:09,465
Scott: well we've done shit but we're doing more.

303
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,502
Scott: I gotta do laundry I gotta eat I gotta do a lot of things all right.

304
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:17,199
Scott: so the greatest Rym agrees and most other people agree.

305
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:24,607
Scott: the greatest animated television series to come out of Japan in the history of the world maybe even in the world ever.

306
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:31,714
Scott: yeah maybe maybe debatable but definitely the best animated television series out of Japan ever.

307
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:36,992
Rym: I would even argue that this is among the best television series animated or not.

308
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:39,158
Scott: period top 5 easily.

309
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,116
Scott: yes best television shows ever is obviously cowboy bebop.

310
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:58,391
Scott: there's no question cowboy bebop we're not gonna spoil anything tonight because mostly also talking about it because it is now available in a in a new $40 box you can get all 26 episodes with surround sound and for $40.

311
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:00,297
Scott: this is the deal of the century.

312
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:03,553
Scott: if you call yourself an anime fan you don't own it.

313
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:04,498
Scott: there's nothing wrong with you.

314
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:05,805
Rym: yes now even more.

315
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:22,192
Rym: I said we're not gonna spoil anything because I've noticed that unlike Star Wars which everyone has in fact seen except for that one girl in my high school who when we were playing the Star Wars theme we were freshmen you know that the best song in Star Wars.

316
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:32,423
Rym: she had the French horn part there and she played it wrong and the conductor was like don't read the music did you know how it goes?

317
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:33,750
Rym: just play the Star Wars thing.

318
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:36,181
Rym: and she says I've never seen Star Wars.

319
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:40,696
Rym: and we immediately stopped and and watched Star Wars.

320
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:42,542
Rym: oh yeah someone went home.

321
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:45,175
Rym: he was allowed to drive home get the DVD brought it back.

322
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:46,884
Rym: we watched Star Wars right there.

323
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:52,331
Scott: your class was that long that someone had time to drive home drive back and sit there for 90 minutes.

324
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:56,590
Scott: well one band was two periods together but still only about 90 minutes or two.

325
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,980
Rym: Star Wars was important enough to where.

326
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:06,384
Rym: we just stayed in the room after the bell rang for another half hour and then the teacher just wrote us all notes saying that band practice got held up for some reason.

327
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:07,612
Rym: he made something up right.

328
00:21:07,712 --> 00:21:08,900
Scott: there's a lot of notes to write.

329
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,229
Scott: goddamn his hand must be hurting.

330
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,578
Rym: well alright you want to give the details.

331
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:13,996
Rym: he wrote one note and send it to the centralized office.

332
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:16,900
Rym: then all the other teachers could check it later and see that people did in fact have an excuse.

333
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:23,100
Rym: but I didn't want to get into the details of the bureaucracy of when we're trying to talk about the greatest to animated television series ever created.

334
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:35,197
Rym: so if you have not seen cowboy bebop and there are a lot of anime fans who have not because it's garily enough even though it's on Cartoon Network like seven times there's a lot of anime and to most anime fans don't.

335
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:39,383
Rym: they might go to conventions but they don't watch a lot of anime and they or they're just getting into it.

336
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:44,648
Rym: a lot of anime fans are new and there aren't a lot of good places to find out what the good anime are.

337
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,204
Rym: so I can conceive of someone who likes anime.

338
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:48,867
Rym: just got into it.

339
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:49,972
Rym: I mean God.

340
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:52,363
Rym: when I got to RIT I'd never heard a cowboy bebop.

341
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,770
Rym: I never heard of it at all.

342
00:21:53,991 --> 00:21:56,522
Rym: I remember sitting at the first RIT anime.

343
00:21:56,623 --> 00:21:59,179
Scott: I was there too but I didn't know you and I didn't see you not at.

344
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:03,871
Rym: the whole front row crew was there but none of us knew each other all sitting in separate seats complete strangers.

345
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:11,456
Rym: like one of those scenes in utenna where like it shows the room and then it freezes and then it kind of like all the people who will eventually be the front row crew are in color.

346
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:14,173
Rym: they're all in different spots of the room and everyone else is in black and white.

347
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:17,651
Rym: and then like you're looking oh it was that was the day but anyway.

348
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:22,319
Rym: so uh and this girl behind me is like oh man yeah they're showing four different anime tonight.

349
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,912
Rym: they're showing that episode of cowboy bebop.

350
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:25,877
Rym: oh which one?

351
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:27,082
Rym: the one where spike fights vicious.

352
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:28,066
Rym: yeah that's the best one.

353
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:31,438
Rym: I'm thinking cowboy bebop.

354
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:38,685
Scott: now the name alone was quite appealing to me the but then the episode where spike fights vicious.

355
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:45,694
Rym: now I heard that I thought is that one of those stupid fighting shows is episode five by the way the last episode of the first DVD.

356
00:22:46,035 --> 00:22:50,777
Rym: now then you know we saw this anime and I remember when that episode played.

357
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:52,286
Rym: I remember thinking right that in there.

358
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:54,922
Rym: wow that was one of the best things I've ever seen.

359
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:59,941
Scott: that was at the time the best thing I had ever seen like it just like I was like.

360
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:03,316
Rym: I was dumbfounded by how awesome that was.

361
00:23:03,336 --> 00:23:04,964
Scott: it's like all the things they showed that night.

362
00:23:05,005 --> 00:23:08,928
Scott: they showed a bunch of music videos including white reflection which none of which had ever seen before.

363
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:16,171
Rym: now I'd seen that and that was but still seeing it on a big screen like that instead of like my tiny and I don't like it as much as other people seem to like it by the way.

364
00:23:16,393 --> 00:23:22,305
Scott: they also showed an episode of guns with cats which I'd never seen and I don't even remember the other things they showed.

365
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:24,678
Rym: I barely remember the rest of that day.

366
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:34,217
Rym: all I remember is that I saw something something I remember it was in room one two thousand something that was so amazing that I I don't know.

367
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:43,265
Rym: and then not too long after that Scott Johnson who was you know one of the executive board people in the club at the time he decided all right I'm gonna marathon that cowboy bebop.

368
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:50,075
Scott: he had the entire DVD box set and he said all right so we're gonna do we're gonna go to building was it eight I think.

369
00:23:50,477 --> 00:23:56,125
Scott: and he said we're gonna stay here for two days and we're gonna watch 13 episodes one day and 13 episodes the next day.

370
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:57,352
Rym: and let me tell God.

371
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:58,296
Scott: that's what we did.

372
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:08,963
Rym: there were a lot of people showed up to that and I remember that pretty much for like the last three or four episodes I don't think a single person said a single God damn word.

373
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:10,710
Scott: no one moved a goddamn muscle.

374
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,999
Rym: like an episode would end.

375
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:13,721
Rym: everyone just sit there.

376
00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:20,249
Rym: no one would even consider getting up to skip the closer or to say anything or to go to the bathroom.

377
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:24,552
Rym: it was just we sat there and then the show ended and everyone sat there through the credits.

378
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:27,106
Scott: credits rolled credits evening menu came on.

379
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:33,703
Rym: then we started to move around a little bit but even then no one would talk and everyone kind of walked out with just the sense of you know that feeling.

380
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,503
Rym: when you see something really good you almost don't want to break the silence.

381
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:37,349
Scott: it was that was.

382
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:45,694
Scott: it's like when you're in a museum and there's that amazing painting or sculpture and you don't talk near it because you'll be disturbing other people trying to experience it.

383
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:50,525
Rym: it was that kind of thing going on and I mean I've experienced that before and there have been other shows and movies and things.

384
00:24:50,546 --> 00:25:06,377
Rym: they've done that for me but cowboy bebop did it to such an extent and not just at the end but at multiple points throughout the show that I don't know that the the emotional baggage that was thrust into me by certain scenes in cowboy bebop is lives with me to this day.

385
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:09,374
Scott: all right so there's nothing wrong with cowboy bebop whatsoever.

386
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:10,822
Scott: it is completely without flaw.

387
00:25:11,063 --> 00:25:14,035
Scott: so let us enumerate the things that it has that are fantastic.

388
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:20,036
Scott: number one the dub and the original Japanese language are equally awesome.

389
00:25:20,096 --> 00:25:23,714
Scott: seriously the English dub some of the best voice acting ever heard.

390
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:25,928
Scott: the Japanese some of the best voice acting I've ever heard.

391
00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:26,895
Scott: you can't go wrong.

392
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:30,192
Scott: you can switch back and forth and you will not even know or care.

393
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:35,997
Rym: I mean let me put it this way the voice of Spike Spiegel in the English dub was what David Lucas.

394
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:44,654
Scott: David Lucas slash whatever his name is that he keeps using different names but he's the guy who is also the voice of Rogers Rogers Smith.

395
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:47,364
Scott: yes the best English voice actor of anime period.

396
00:25:47,586 --> 00:26:03,307
Rym: now at the same time in the Japanese cast and these are all big names but they was played by someone particularly is also the voice actors for Bulbasaur Japanese voice actors for Bulbasaur and Misato and everyone else.

397
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:14,335
Rym: let me put it this way the cast of cowboy bebop dub and sub were like some of the most high-powered amazing talent and it shows like that is the best English dub ever of an anime.

398
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,507
Rym: I don't think I've ever seen anything that even came close.

399
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:28,051
Scott: in some of the episodes the English dub is better than the Japanese dub and in some in they in the early episode the Japanese a little better because the voice actors is still sort of the English voice actor is still sort of figuring it out this way.

400
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:33,980
Rym: the worst voice acting in the English cowboy bebop is in the first episode with one side character that

401
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,032
Scott: you never see again in the next 25 episodes and

402
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:45,702
Rym: pretty much by the time you hit episode 7 or 8 the voice actors have really gotten into it and there's a scene and there's a scene near the end where a character is talking to other character.

403
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:47,549
Rym: obviously you know spoilers.

404
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:53,532
Rym: whatever spoiling cowboy bebop spoiling anything about cowboy bebop is a shitty thing to do.

405
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:59,800
Rym: yes cowboy bebop is is amazing and if you have not seen cowboy bebop we're not gonna spoil it tonight.

406
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,518
Rym: but for the love of God do not risk having the show ruined for you.

407
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,307
Rym: you need to watch it as soon as possible.

408
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:08,968
Scott: I'm not I cannot stress that enough and the show has sort of like a hold on you.

409
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:13,678
Scott: if you start watching and you have more of it available you won't stop unless you really have to do something else.

410
00:27:13,738 --> 00:27:14,583
Scott: yeah I remember we were not.

411
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:19,992
Rym: we just moved back into RIT after like a summer vacation and we had a box set sitting there for some reason.

412
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:24,380
Rym: and we just we watched a couple episodes like yeah let's watch some cowboy bebop and then play some.

413
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:28,614
Rym: and then you know episode 26 ended and school started.

414
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:29,478
Scott: eight hours later.

415
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:31,605
Scott: we just watched the last episode.

416
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:54,586
Rym: but there's a scene near the end and this is some of the best vote where a character is trying to convince another character not to go somewhere and the first the character the first is just start shooting a gun into the air into the ceiling on a ship and that scene and the best acting.

417
00:27:54,646 --> 00:28:02,085
Scott: well that's some of the best acting I've ever heard or seen in my life and you might think oh it's the best acting period simply the best voice acting in an anime.

418
00:28:02,205 --> 00:28:07,030
Rym: well some of that I didn't say the best some of the best that was that was top-notch acting.

419
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:11,769
Rym: yes I'm not acting for sure and I'm being very evasive but you'll know the scene.

420
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:18,138
Rym: because I showed cowboy bebop I lent it to someone at my work back when I way back when I worked at IBM.

421
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:20,351
Rym: we didn't know much about anime what but his kid was into it.

422
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:24,532
Rym: so I told him to watch cowboy bebop and after he finished he came back to work.

423
00:28:24,572 --> 00:28:30,059
Rym: next came my office and he basically just kept talking about that scene and about how amazing it was.

424
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:38,986
Rym: now now he seemed like there's this anime and it's amazing and that was like the best thing ever and he couldn't believe and I had to break it to him that that was pretty much the best thing.

425
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:41,015
Rym: so yeah it's all downhill from there.

426
00:28:41,035 --> 00:28:42,241
Scott: yep all right.

427
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:46,782
Scott: the next thing that is awesome about cowboy bebop is the animation is awesome.

428
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:52,287
Scott: it is like made by sunrise here the people who did the Batman's and the big O's and the Gundams.

429
00:28:53,171 --> 00:28:54,619
Scott: I don't see anything wrong in this animation.

430
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,587
Scott: in fact this is from 1998.

431
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:59,639
Scott: I watched it now on DVD still looks fantastic.

432
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:01,649
Scott: he could have been made last year and I would have believed you.

433
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:02,413
Rym: this show was.

434
00:29:02,895 --> 00:29:05,307
Rym: is the character like it is some of the tech.

435
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:10,792
Rym: the characters are on model perfectly all the time like everything is just perfect.

436
00:29:10,893 --> 00:29:22,005
Scott: every scene every detail every little bit is just right there and a lot and like you watch some like the the action scenes with his fighting and kung fu moves going on and they animated all the kung fu.

437
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:25,923
Scott: it's like a kung fu movie the kind of motion and energy you get out of the.

438
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:26,727
Scott: the animation.

439
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:27,571
Rym: let's get right into that.

440
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:33,622
Rym: the fights everything that's choreographed in this show is choreographed to a degree that is almost excessive.

441
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:53,277
Rym: mmm like it is like the first episode is a is a is a pale example but it's a good example of suddenly there's a fight scene where two characters are fighting with each other around a table and like in this outside cantina cafe and that is cool as that is that doesn't even hold a candle to pretty much the rest of the show.

442
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:58,058
Rym: yeah I need like the the perot episode the fights in that episode.

443
00:29:58,138 --> 00:29:59,906
Scott: bang that's the Batman episode.

444
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:05,534
Scott: yeah like you've seen Batman the animated series the original good one and then you see that episode.

445
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:07,506
Scott: you'll know the same people made both these shows.

446
00:30:07,546 --> 00:30:08,814
Scott: there's no question in your mind.

447
00:30:09,237 --> 00:30:11,328
Scott: even someone who knows nothing about our can recognize that.

448
00:30:11,952 --> 00:30:15,880
Rym: but like the ship designs the character designs everything is just amazing.

449
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,446
Scott: yep all right.

450
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:24,014
Scott: the third thing that is awesome I can't wait bebop is that it has the best music probably of any anime that has ever existed.

451
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:28,814
Rym: now we're not gonna tell the whole story but yoko kano did the music for cowboy.

452
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:40,317
Rym: yoko kano is pretty much the best composer for anime and I think that she stands as a great composer independent of anime independent of any soundtrack.

453
00:30:40,358 --> 00:30:47,567
Rym: she's done her symphonic works rival people the people who write symphonic works and nothing but symphonic works for a living.

454
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:52,917
Rym: and yet she is also capable of doing things that are completely a hundred eighty degrees away from that.

455
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,707
Scott: and not to mention that it is all.

456
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:59,109
Scott: the music is performed by the seatbelts who would otherwise be unknown without cowboy bebop?

457
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:04,296
Scott: but instead I have everyone every cowboy beyond v3 there is because they're so fantastic.

458
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:05,925
Rym: is that all performed by the seatbelt?

459
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:09,562
Rym: and most of it is but the you know what when you watch the show?

460
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:19,047
Rym: there's certain stuff like the the walk in the rain song and the real folk blues and even from the movie though I'm not gonna talk about the movie but that's not.

461
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:21,440
Rym: that's well out of the scope of this but got an ocular.

462
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:24,593
Rym: there's some good freaking music in that show yeah.

463
00:31:24,874 --> 00:31:33,345
Rym: and also I point out that yoko kano is scored other great amazing anime and her effort in cowboy bebop was up to par with all of those.

464
00:31:33,365 --> 00:31:35,517
Rym: all of those were up to par with cowboy bebop.

465
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:38,371
Scott: I think I was slightly above all the other.

466
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:41,367
Rym: I submit that eska flown a has an absolutely amazing sound.

467
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:42,253
Scott: I didn't say it doesn't.

468
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:44,568
Scott: I think how everyone's still just better by a little bit.

469
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:48,668
Scott: well I mean some of the other things she's done have not been as great as cologne a.

470
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:54,772
Rym: it's because cowboy bebop is more like edgy and catchy and it's more like thematic for the scenes.

471
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:58,409
Rym: but in eska flown a it's much more symphonic and much more.

472
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,921
Rym: it's a totally different kind of music that she wrote.

473
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:02,406
Scott: yeah anyway.

474
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,036
Scott: so what else is so awesome a cowboy bebop?

475
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:07,226
Scott: well perhaps the story and the characters.

476
00:32:07,507 --> 00:32:28,776
Rym: now there's an interesting thing about cowboy bebop because they're basically if you take out certain episodes from the show and there aren't that many of them you can watch the whole show and while characters progress and and and character relationships and all these sorts of things in the world progress the plot doesn't.

477
00:32:28,837 --> 00:32:31,551
Rym: there's no real plot and it's basically just an episodic show.

478
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:38,850
Rym: you can pick any one episode watch it and in and of itself knowing nothing about the universe knowing nothing about the characters is an enjoyable episode.

479
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,973
Scott: you can watch any one of these episodes yet they're really only episode 5 episodes 12 and 13. or is it 13 or 14?

480
00:32:43,973 --> 00:32:56,877
Scott: I forget there's two episodes in the middle episode 5 and a group of episodes at the end and pretty much none of the episodes really are you know plot?

481
00:32:56,897 --> 00:33:01,642
Scott: it's not a serial plot like a Gundam show where each episode has to be watched in order.

482
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:07,499
Scott: I mean that helps because you know something will happen to one character in one episode and then they'll bring it up in a future one.

483
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:13,552
Scott: or they'll teach you something about the universe and then talk about that or make a reference to in a later episode.

484
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:14,557
Scott: but it's not necessary.

485
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:19,299
Scott: most of the episodes you can just watch never having seen or know anything about you.

486
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:25,143
Scott: you just like take episode 20 and just fucking watch it not knowing shit and it'll.

487
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,276
Scott: it'll totally work even if you know nothing now.

488
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:36,544
Rym: right along those lines one of the greatest strengths of cowboy bebop and again most of my examples I have to avoid mentioning because a lot of what I have to say would involve spoilers.

489
00:33:36,604 --> 00:33:40,680
Rym: but basically cowboy bebop is a character driven show.

490
00:33:40,781 --> 00:33:49,713
Rym: now sometimes people worry about words like that because there's character driven shows and plot driven shows and usually a plot driven show means the characters are bullshit character designs.

491
00:33:49,733 --> 00:33:50,921
Rym: they're just there to have the plot.

492
00:33:51,544 --> 00:33:53,934
Rym: and a character driven show means well there's no setting.

493
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:59,280
Scott: yeah it's just like as among a time be a character driven show but it's just these people.

494
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:00,287
Scott: you look at the characters.

495
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:01,900
Scott: the characters do the same thing every time.

496
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,963
Scott: how we be bots.

497
00:34:03,023 --> 00:34:07,999
Rym: it has a setting that in and of itself could be a show.

498
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:13,878
Rym: the setting alone is so rich and so detailed and there's so much plot there.

499
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:22,993
Rym: there there are the plots for three or four solid full season anime in this world that are kind of touched on by cowboy bebop.

500
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:30,422
Scott: but you know how a lot of a lot of nerdy things like the forgotten realms or or Star Wars or Star Trek right or whatever.

501
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:32,068
Scott: it's all about setting.

502
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:33,233
Scott: and you know these nerds.

503
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:38,141
Scott: they go on and on about the setting in the history of this universe and that they're really big into that.

504
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:38,967
Scott: it's like the thing they love.

505
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:55,543
Scott: more than anything is a show or some sort of series of novels or any you know work that really fleshes out a setting in incredible detail from beginning to end as far back into the future and it's as far into the past as they can possibly get you know with everything and that's what they love.

506
00:34:56,045 --> 00:35:11,130
Scott: cowboy bebop simultaneously like makes those people happy and also gives them a giant finger because they make this incredibly incredibly detailed universe that could have this incredibly huge past and incredibly huge future that's super fleshed out.

507
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:16,356
Scott: but all they do is tell a story about some characters in that universe and they pretty.

508
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:21,457
Scott: they mostly ignore all that really big continuity kind of stuff that nerds love.

509
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:26,217
Rym: it's it's just that the story of cowboy bebop is the story of these people.

510
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:34,104
Rym: it is a story about these five six seven people who grow and change and learn and it's that's it.

511
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:35,029
Rym: that's what the show is.

512
00:35:35,129 --> 00:35:46,404
Rym: everything else every single thing in this show the plot the whatever is just a conduit for watching these characters evolve and empathizing with them and then finding out how this all comes together with them.

513
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:47,672
Rym: in the end it there's this.

514
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:52,019
Rym: there's the kind of background plot there's an instant that happened in the world long time ago.

515
00:35:52,039 --> 00:36:03,004
Scott: it's not really a spoiler because it doesn't matter because the shows about the characters and I want to avoid talking about specifics just anyway because I think it but anyway before the show began there was some sort of explosion of some sort right.

516
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:20,763
Scott: and then during the show you know there are certain episodes in which use the plot of that one episode only sort of revolves around the results of that thing that happened way before the show started that had nothing to do with these characters and sometimes that it won't even be the plot of the episode.

517
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:28,335
Scott: it'll just be like a little touch like something that happens in one scene and you know you won't even realize that.

518
00:36:28,516 --> 00:36:35,510
Scott: oh that's because of this thing that happened in the past unless you really pay fucking close attention and it's just ah it's great yep it's.

519
00:36:35,951 --> 00:36:57,089
Rym: the idea is that cowboy bebop is a story about these characters and the mistake that would have ruined cowboy bebop would have been that if these characters were central to like the plot the overarching epic plot of the world and everything going on like the you know the epic we're gonna save the world plot that almost like most anime are about the show is just about these people.

520
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,506
Scott: yeah this is there is a save the world thing going on somewhere.

521
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,415
Scott: maybe it happened already you don't even know.

522
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:08,288
Scott: but instead you just see these people who happen to be dealing with their own bullshit and then they deal with their own bullshit.

523
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:10,723
Rym: then it shows over a real good example of that.

524
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:12,292
Rym: this is such a minor spoiler.

525
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:12,876
Rym: I think it's worth it.

526
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:13,419
Rym: just illustrate.

527
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,135
Rym: the point is in the eco-terrorism episode mm-hmm how what the main characters do like oh we're gonna save the world didn't mean Jack.

528
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,461
Rym: the government just fixed it.

529
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:24,406
Rym: yep think government just did it.

530
00:37:24,426 --> 00:37:30,383
Scott: okay let's let's actually hear the show there.

531
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:39,197
Scott: the main characters the show our spike badass kung-fu bounty hunter jet X cop bounty hunting partner Faye Valentine a woman with a.

532
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:41,546
Rym: she's almost like a noir as kind of.

533
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:48,835
Rym: she's a woman with a mystery in her hit in her past and some sort of dark secret and some debts like a femme fatale.

534
00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:52,428
Scott: yep and she likes to gamble and also be naughty.

535
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:55,398
Scott: and Ed who sort of does?

536
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:58,734
Scott: some people don't like it because it doesn't fit but I think it is amazing.

537
00:37:58,915 --> 00:38:03,298
Rym: I think Ed is critical to that show not from a plot perspective but I don't want.

538
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:04,122
Rym: I can't say why.

539
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:06,311
Scott: yeah but Ed is a basically a hacker.

540
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:07,737
Scott: this is young girls.

541
00:38:07,777 --> 00:38:08,561
Scott: was she like you know?

542
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:09,284
Scott: 10 maybe?

543
00:38:09,324 --> 00:38:11,272
Scott: no really 14 I can't even tell.

544
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:14,748
Rym: I'd say that ein is just as much of a character - I was gonna get to ein.

545
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:21,697
Scott: okay and Ed is a hacker who's like the ultimate hacker but she always speaks in rhyme and it's sort of quirky.

546
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:24,929
Scott: and then you have ein the dog who shows up.

547
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:33,125
Scott: I think in episode 2 I believe it's just the dog that's on the ship and they're all in this ship the bebop going around bounty hunting.

548
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:35,780
Scott: you may have their own little fighter ships which are also cool.

549
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:44,026
Rym: now you might think it's it's and some people have said this that fireflies a little bit like that and I've heard talk that there might have been something fireflies about bounty hunters.

550
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:44,569
Rym: no it's not.

551
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:58,180
Rym: but in terms of the idea of a story that just follows people and just like you're in this ship and they're traveling together doing whatever they do and the drama is all from these people's interactions with each other as opposed to the plot of some world well

552
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,414
Scott: it's their interaction with each other and also their inner.

553
00:39:01,454 --> 00:39:13,193
Scott: at each episode is sort of in a way borrows from Galaxy Express 3 9 TV where there's some you know sometimes they'll be at one planet sometimes at another you know because they can fly all over the galaxy or universe.

554
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:15,166
Scott: who even knows right I guess they go to Ganymede.

555
00:39:15,206 --> 00:39:15,468
Scott: sometimes.

556
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:16,113
Scott: where's Ganymede?

557
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:16,374
Scott: is that?

558
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:27,791
Scott: so I guess it stays within the solar system right but anyway they fly all around hunting bounties you know and each bounty sort of has its own little plot and that's why the show is episodic and some of the plots are really.

559
00:39:28,174 --> 00:39:32,617
Scott: they could make movies out of those plots but instead they put him in a less than 30 minute episode.

560
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,389
Rym: now we talked about you know the characters.

561
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:37,952
Rym: there's so many like these characters and we gave you a very superficial overview.

562
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:43,819
Rym: but these characters are three-dimensional to to a degree that is almost like it's almost frightening.

563
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,951
Scott: how much you'll empathize you know I think a lot.

564
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:52,885
Scott: the reason that that happens in the show so much is because a lot of other shows they will sort of have a big cast and cowboy bebop.

565
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,116
Scott: they might have a in any one episode.

566
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:02,332
Scott: you'll have plenty of characters but most of them will be just for that one episode and you really only have a very small cast less than ten.

567
00:40:02,352 --> 00:40:03,979
Scott: you know less than five.

568
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:05,787
Scott: even they get significant screen time.

569
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:08,642
Scott: it is really only the four when you really think about it.

570
00:40:08,662 --> 00:40:14,749
Scott: cuz ein while he's important is just a dog and he goes woof woof woof right and it's just four.

571
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,483
Scott: so when you've only got four you can you put all your effort into them.

572
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:24,028
Scott: you can really build it up instead of having to you know sort of spread the peanut butter thin across.

573
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:29,735
Rym: you know maybe ten but at the same time almost every episode kind of has its own cast.

574
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:39,342
Rym: like there'll be these characters that are introduced and pretty much all the side characters that are pivotal to an episode or that get screen time or FaceTime or you know speaking line you know their name.

575
00:40:40,466 --> 00:40:44,300
Rym: yeah they're just as fleshed out as the main characters.

576
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,957
Rym: the only thing they lack is enough screen time to see all of it.

577
00:40:48,017 --> 00:40:49,444
Rym: but it's obvious that it's there.

578
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:50,128
Scott: yeah it's.

579
00:40:50,268 --> 00:40:50,409
Scott: it's.

580
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:59,034
Scott: it's sort of magical sometimes how they'll bring in a character you've never seen before ever and then suddenly it's like their main character in the show that's been in every episode.

581
00:40:59,175 --> 00:41:00,443
Scott: like they they flush them out.

582
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:02,352
Scott: so well it's the character design.

583
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:03,659
Scott: all really fits.

584
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:18,233
Scott: every character that you know they they make and you know the what they usually will show you that character like they'll give them a scene or two separate from the main characters to sort of you know build them up a bit and then suddenly when the stuff happens you're like ah shit oh man

585
00:41:18,273 --> 00:41:19,137
Rym: slow like water.

586
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:22,054
Scott: yeah well I guess the best example I think is the full like water.

587
00:41:22,074 --> 00:41:28,097
Rym: again I think an equally important one is grand yeah and even the the duo in the first episode.

588
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,272
Rym: yeah cuz that's them that's a movie by itself.

589
00:41:31,695 --> 00:41:33,303
Rym: actually this is what I want to talk about cuz this is.

590
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:39,372
Rym: this is like the biggest thing about cowboy bebop and I think we're gonna do a show in the future just about this.

591
00:41:39,432 --> 00:41:52,230
Rym: but episode one the very first episode of cowboy bebop in and of itself is like this masterpiece even beyond a lot of the other episodes just in the sense that it's a movie in and of itself.

592
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,624
Rym: you could take that and make it a movie and it's perfect and it.

593
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:59,625
Rym: it's less than 30 minutes and it's like this cyclical like I don't want to.

594
00:42:00,086 --> 00:42:09,828
Rym: it's a cycle and it kind of ends where it began and yet it introduces everything you need to know about the show and it's and two of the main characters are in the show yet and it's.

595
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:15,350
Rym: that episode is absolutely amazing and how it's composed and how it's put together it.

596
00:42:15,752 --> 00:42:17,560
Rym: every single detail is there.

597
00:42:17,741 --> 00:42:20,353
Rym: just everything that happens conveys something.

598
00:42:20,393 --> 00:42:23,227
Rym: there is nothing extraneous in the first episode of cowboy bebop.

599
00:42:23,268 --> 00:42:31,873
Scott: nope and there is the cowboy bebop movie which we're not going to talk about but the movie is a great movie but it's really just a long episode of cowboy bebop.

600
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:34,708
Scott: yeah pretty much some extended action scenes and whatnot.

601
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:37,705
Scott: it's sort of like well you finish the show and you want another episode.

602
00:42:38,046 --> 00:42:41,505
Rym: here's another episode and it takes place in the midst of the show.

603
00:42:41,585 --> 00:42:43,075
Rym: so you can just watch the movie if you want.

604
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:43,719
Rym: it doesn't spoil it.

605
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:53,661
Scott: yeah if you look online they'll tell you like watch the movie in between this episode and this episode and it'll make sense and like okay sure but man and we're.

606
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:57,344
Rym: you know we're watching cowboy bebop again because it's hard not to when it's right.

607
00:42:57,424 --> 00:43:01,704
Scott: I bought it for 40 bucks I popped it in and well you're gonna keep fucking watching it.

608
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:11,066
Rym: I have a lot of trouble not exclaiming periodically about how great the show is when I'm watching it again and just going oh man that oh that.

609
00:43:11,086 --> 00:43:11,729
Rym: I remember that.

610
00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:15,710
Scott: oh yeah and this time I'm watching I'm seeing more in this show than ever seen before.

611
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,726
Scott: there's things that I can't believe I missed in previous watchings.

612
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:23,771
Rym: yep I mean it's not like utana where you watch the show a hundred times and you still see new things.

613
00:43:23,831 --> 00:43:31,407
Scott: yeah it's not that of a. you know deep there's not heavy you know hard to figure out sort of end of evangelical type stuff going on.

614
00:43:31,448 --> 00:43:40,211
Scott: but there's a lot of symbolism and there's a lot of you know references and coincidences and connections between things and they're not hard to notice.

615
00:43:40,252 --> 00:43:44,250
Scott: they're pretty in your face but you still I don't just didn't notice them all before.

616
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:53,208
Rym: I don't know what else I could say this show is without just describing the plot or or just peeing all over yourself something like that.

617
00:43:53,268 --> 00:43:55,219
Rym: this show the show will affect you.

618
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:08,610
Rym: I mean it is hard to not react emotionally not just to the end not just to like but too much of the show and in fact almost every episode almost every episode episode you can get away.

619
00:44:08,871 --> 00:44:13,247
Scott: yes also the mushroom mushroom Samba mushroom Samba shrooms.

620
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:16,219
Scott: oh that's got to be the third best episode in the show.

621
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:20,862
Scott: hands down yeah that episode and the chess episode I think is not so good but whatever.

622
00:44:21,264 --> 00:44:24,982
Rym: yeah I mean the thing is the worst episodes of cowboy bebop are amazing.

623
00:44:25,103 --> 00:44:32,822
Rym: yeah the chess episode is better than most other anime and the best episodes will make you react to an emotional level that you might not be comfortable with.

624
00:44:33,684 --> 00:44:37,033
Rym: I mean I talk about how I cry at anime a lot and I I rod.

625
00:44:37,073 --> 00:44:46,842
Rym: you know what I'll say this I cried at a bunch of times throughout cowboy bebop but there were some scenes when it was almost to the point where I couldn't cry.

626
00:44:46,882 --> 00:44:47,565
Rym: that would like.

627
00:44:47,605 --> 00:44:48,891
Rym: crying wouldn't have done it justice.

628
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:52,731
Scott: yeah what about you gonna talk about how the show originally aired?

629
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:53,254
Scott: and it's in it?

630
00:44:53,314 --> 00:44:53,878
Scott: they ruined it.

631
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,565
Rym: oh yeah that let me.

632
00:44:55,765 --> 00:44:57,873
Scott: when cowboy bebop had some troubles.

633
00:44:58,174 --> 00:45:10,576
Rym: cowboy bebop was made in like 1998 and they tried to brought ten year old show people ten years on TV Tokyo and the show was edgy for the time too edgy too violent too serious.

634
00:45:10,997 --> 00:45:20,422
Rym: so they actually only showed five episodes which five episode two three seven fifteen and eighteen.

635
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:24,861
Scott: so like just these random I had it all finished but they only showed five.

636
00:45:25,303 --> 00:45:29,740
Rym: and then it wasn't until 1999 that they showed cowboy bebop in its entirety.

637
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,894
Rym: and even then they showed it on a wah-wah satellite mm-hmm.

638
00:45:33,477 --> 00:45:40,915
Rym: and when it was shown in America too they actually edited a couple took out some of the episodes like the one with teddy bomber the terrorists.

639
00:45:40,935 --> 00:45:41,620
Scott: they take that one out.

640
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,429
Scott: there's another one with the kid.

641
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:44,756
Scott: yeah it's like that one out.

642
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:48,877
Rym: yes because the episode ends it with something that is not cool to be shown on American TV.

643
00:45:48,897 --> 00:45:56,841
Rym: nope and they also edited episode 13 yep somewhat heavily and that this show is not.

644
00:45:57,704 --> 00:45:58,025
Rym: I'm not.

645
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:03,186
Rym: my idea is that this show should be promoted and then shown on primetime TV in the u.s.

646
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,014
Rym: and that would push anime to the mainstream.

647
00:46:05,034 --> 00:46:10,823
Scott: this is a show that every human being who is mature enough to understand and watch it will enjoy.

648
00:46:10,843 --> 00:46:14,501
Scott: I've never met anyone who didn't watch this and go oh man is a great.

649
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:17,799
Scott: unless they were you know didn't understand it or you know something.

650
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:23,604
Scott: but the vast majority of human beings in Western society will watch this and enjoy it and love it.

651
00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:26,016
Scott: there's more than anything I've ever seen.

652
00:46:26,077 --> 00:46:28,913
Scott: even people who don't like anime have no understand but you can watch.

653
00:46:29,215 --> 00:46:32,171
Scott: have them watch this show and they'll be like oh man's oh man's.

654
00:46:32,231 --> 00:46:33,799
Scott: it's as good as all those shows.

655
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:35,850
Scott: you're watching HBO that everyone goes nuts over.

656
00:46:36,231 --> 00:46:38,061
Scott: better better better that's for sure.

657
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:42,549
Scott: yes but I'm talking about you know it's in the same kind of thing and I mean I've shown this to my parents.

658
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:47,492
Rym: I've shown it to a lot of people who would never watch anime in their life and they love it.

659
00:46:47,532 --> 00:46:48,857
Rym: my dad loved this show.

660
00:46:48,877 --> 00:46:50,985
Rym: yep your dad love it too.

661
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:55,846
Rym: dads like this show and so do moms moms and dads watching the cowboy bebop.

662
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:59,003
Rym: I think we should end there because I have to pack for katsu-kan.

663
00:46:59,103 --> 00:47:00,107
Scott: I got to do more laundry.

664
00:47:00,348 --> 00:47:05,029
Rym: but seriously if you have not seen cowboy bebop I watch it.

665
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:06,074
Rym: it might sound like our Rym.

666
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:07,946
Rym: and Scott you're just gushing over the show cuz you like it.

667
00:47:07,986 --> 00:47:09,255
Scott: no there's not much else you can do.

668
00:47:09,276 --> 00:47:11,911
Scott: an episode about cowboy you've up except analyze or gush.

669
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:13,177
Scott: that's really only two options.

670
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:19,713
Rym: but I feel like I think a lot of people I'm you know I may realize later I may or may not be prone to exaggeration at many points in my life.

671
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:22,104
Rym: I don't think I've exaggerated at all.

672
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:22,567
Scott: I don't think you.

673
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,576
Scott: I think you've under exaggerated.

674
00:47:24,817 --> 00:47:28,251
Scott: this show is one didn't exaggerate enough to reach the truth.

675
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:30,903
Rym: this show is the pinnacle of anime.

676
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:33,217
Rym: I mean there are great shows that came out after this.

677
00:47:33,257 --> 00:47:48,753
Rym: there are great shows that came out before it but cowboy bebop was the first and only show ever in any medium I've ever seen that had the balls to say openly and straight up in episode I think 13 or 14.

678
00:47:48,753 --> 00:47:49,798
Scott: every episode they have.

679
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:56,214
Scott: so you know the iCatch you know the thing that they show and then there's a commercial and then they show the iCatch again in episode 13 or 14.

680
00:47:56,214 --> 00:47:57,159
Scott: I forget which one it's.

681
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,309
Scott: it's either part 1 or part 2 of Jupiter jazz.

682
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:01,633
Scott: right they show.

683
00:48:01,954 --> 00:48:05,932
Scott: the iCatch says right on it in English even though it's a Japanese show.

684
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:16,544
Scott: in English in the iCatch they write the show that what will for create a new genre shall hereby be known as cowboy or something like that something like that and it's they had the balls.

685
00:48:16,906 --> 00:48:17,811
Rym: I mean think about it.

686
00:48:17,851 --> 00:48:20,847
Rym: if you see a show two shows like yeah we created a new genre.

687
00:48:20,888 --> 00:48:23,882
Rym: yeah that that's immediately sets off the bullshit pretension.

688
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:24,164
Rym: detect.

689
00:48:24,224 --> 00:48:25,812
Scott: it's like wow you know way to.

690
00:48:25,993 --> 00:48:29,370
Scott: it's like saying I am so great but that's beyond saying I am so great.

691
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:34,258
Scott: that's like saying it's like if I went up and I said yeah I'm a better radio guy than Howard Stern time.

692
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:34,820
Rym: no that's like.

693
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:37,067
Rym: I have changed radio.

694
00:48:37,628 --> 00:48:40,235
Rym: radio is now a different thing because of me.

695
00:48:40,255 --> 00:48:43,187
Scott: yes you know what it's like.

696
00:48:43,227 --> 00:48:49,179
Scott: say it's like putting yourself on the artistic level is like Michelangelo like sculpture and painting are different because of me.

697
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,551
Scott: the world is different because of this thing.

698
00:48:51,752 --> 00:48:54,305
Scott: one work of art that I have created is that great and you know what.

699
00:48:54,747 --> 00:48:57,620
Rym: I can find no fault with cowboy bebop saying that.

700
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:08,762
Scott: now they said it and they they put it right there and you read it and you go yep you did way to know way to know what you did because most people don't like you.

701
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:09,586
Scott: did Michelangelo?

702
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,053
Scott: did he really know how awesome he was?

703
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,199
Rym: did he really?

704
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,868
Rym: I think DaVinci knew how awesome he was.

705
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:23,273
Scott: DaVinci's different story but yeah it's very rare that someone is awesome knows how awesome they are whips out their balls rubs them in your face and says look how awesome I am.

706
00:49:23,313 --> 00:49:26,725
Scott: and you say yep your balls sure are awesome.

707
00:49:27,246 --> 00:49:39,377
Rym: I cannot deny give me more so but cowboy bebop the pinnacle the peak of anime I I look forward I'm sure.

708
00:49:39,418 --> 00:49:45,385
Rym: I hope that at some point in my life someone makes a show to like it that I can honestly say is better than cowboy be.

709
00:49:45,405 --> 00:49:53,266
Scott: really if I was making anime I basically have those same people try to make more shows and I mean that you should eat sugar Watanabe who's director made Samurai Champloo.

710
00:49:53,346 --> 00:49:53,647
Scott: also.

711
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:55,595
Rym: Samurai Champloo is awesome.

712
00:49:55,675 --> 00:50:00,777
Scott: it tried but anyways it was but it wasn't as good as cowboy bop but he was still awesome.

713
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,404
Rym: yeah but I don't.

714
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:10,322
Rym: I just someday I'd like to be able to say wow that show was better than cowboy bebop and with the exception of maybe five or six shows that came close.

715
00:50:10,784 --> 00:50:13,978
Rym: nothing's even been in the same ballpark not even close I mean.

00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:20,674
Scott: if I was making anime I'd have a really hard time because anything they put in front of me I'd watch it and I say was that as good as cowboy bop?

717
00:50:20,775 --> 00:50:22,346
Scott: and if it wasn't I wouldn't let him put it out.

718
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:27,761
Scott: I would just keep making him work until they made something better and it would probably sit there until they died making no money.

719
00:50:28,123 --> 00:50:28,464
Scott: all right.

720
00:50:28,504 --> 00:50:37,401
Rym: so on that note we will hopefully see many of you at Katsucon and right now I'm going to pack up the GeekNights road kit and put it in Scott's car.
