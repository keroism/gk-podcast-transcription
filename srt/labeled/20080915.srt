1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,647
Rym: It's Monday September 15th.

2
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:12,490
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,848
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight IPV6.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,603
Scott: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:33,864
Rym: I live I'm back.

6
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:35,048
Scott: That's not good.

7
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,816
Rym: I'm no longer hacking up my lungs.

8
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:37,820
Rym: I'm no longer sick.

9
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:38,809
Rym: It's a good feeling.

10
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:47,620
Scott: you know last week I was like really wanted to do episodes, and I still want to do episodes too I mean, but I don't want to do them as much as I wanted to do them last week.

11
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:49,166
Scott: It's all your fault.

12
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:50,414
Rym: Oh, so you don't want to do the show.

13
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:51,562
Rym: we could just stop right now I do.

14
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:54,080
Scott: I just don't want to do it as much as I want to do it before.

15
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,186
Rym: Uh-huh, I think you just want to do things you get.

16
00:00:56,247 --> 00:01:00,540
Scott: a few people are getting a slightly lesser quality show because of rims.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,403
Scott: Non-immunity to illness.

18
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:06,857
Scott: you know I said in the house full of sick people for a week and nothing happened to me.

19
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:10,840
Rym: all right Let's chalk that up to your sedentary lifestyle.

20
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:13,965
Scott: I Shouldn't be so.

21
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:16,575
Scott: you're saying the sedentary lifestyle is a barrier now.

22
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:17,880
Rym: It's more that I guess I get out.

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,128
Rym: I'm exposed to more things.

24
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,860
Rym: I put myself at more risk for greater reward.

25
00:01:22,802 --> 00:01:25,117
Rym: Yeah, okay, I think that's definitely the cause.

26
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:28,673
Scott: no I think how could I be at more risk than in-house for the sick people.

27
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:33,432
Rym: you pretty much avoided us And we avoided you though It's not it's same house.

28
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:33,876
Scott: It's all good.

29
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:45,680
Rym: anyway We're back and to make up for the fact that the only show we did last week was a somewhat Abbreviated Friday night party line where I basically sat there quiet or slowly went off and rambling tangents because I was sick and tired.

30
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:48,059
Rym: But we're gonna do three shows this week.

31
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:55,540
Rym: So I guess the way I would put it is it's a Monday Wednesday week, and we just we're gonna do a Tuesday to be nice.

32
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:58,678
Scott: Yeah, we've got too much packs that we still have.

33
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,864
Rym: not I think.

34
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:05,580
Rym: all told we're gonna be able to say that there were at least seven episodes directly caused by going to packs.

35
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:09,000
Rym: Yeah, pretty much Luckily only two maybe three of them.

36
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:12,800
Rym: I think three and a half of them are going to be about packs and the rest are just tertiary.

37
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:15,620
Scott: Yeah, so we're gonna do some tech news, right?

38
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,820
Scott: But we've got how many like weeks worth of tech news we haven't talked about.

39
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:23,251
Rym: And the worst thing is I have this list of like nine articles.

40
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,695
Rym: I really wanted to talk about.

41
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,367
Rym: I mean last Monday I had a ton of news.

42
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:32,408
Rym: I wanted to talk about if I hadn't been sick, but Scott has some news.

43
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:33,938
Rym: that kind of is just breaking that.

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,896
Rym: Really it made us kind of have to forget about all that other BS I got.

45
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:45,920
Scott: all these news is no I got to do one that I just saw Just now a second before we started doing the show and worse than that, right?

46
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,879
Scott: It's like Apple put out there like new nano and whatnot, right?

47
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,685
Scott: Well, we got two.

48
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:57,251
Scott: Apple news is but they're not related in any way to the announcements They just made which were pretty in.

49
00:02:57,673 --> 00:03:00,400
Rym: I know I mean pretty much though I mean the feeling I had is like man.

50
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:02,950
Rym: I totally got to talk about all this awesome news.

51
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:06,792
Rym: and then someone walks into the room and they're like, oh, hey Microsoft went open source.

52
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:10,505
Rym: Yeah, a hundred percent Damn savers repealed.

53
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:14,119
Rym: Yeah, Bill Gates just wrote you personally a check for a million dollars because he felt like it.

54
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:14,742
Scott: Yeah.

55
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:16,188
Rym: Yeah, that's what I feel like right now.

56
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:16,489
Rym: Of course.

57
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:17,975
Rym: It's not the good news.

58
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:19,080
Rym: It's actually the bad news.

59
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,597
Rym: It's more like Microsoft sued Linus Torvalds and then shot him.

60
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:29,780
Rym: Yep Oh, well, so I gotta I'll talk about this first because once we get on to Scott's news, there's really no turning back.

61
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:36,840
Rym: so Apple in their infinite wisdom has decided that this a scourge has got to end.

62
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,720
Rym: They're done with this bullshit and they're gonna file a patent to make sure that people don't pull this crap off anymore.

63
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:46,603
Rym: No more shenanigans, you see Apparently, oh, no.

64
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:47,064
Rym: No, you know what?

65
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,130
Rym: I'll quote from the patent application.

66
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,079
Rym: quote Apple.

67
00:03:51,762 --> 00:04:08,710
Rym: Some people have taken it upon themselves To remove the sensor from the special pocket of the iPod linked Nike plus shoe Place it in inappropriate locations like the shoelaces or place it on non Nike plus shoes.

68
00:04:09,578 --> 00:04:10,750
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

69
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:30,864
Rym: So Apple is filing a patent for clothing DRM in order to try to make it illegal and in and/or You to take this little cheap sensor from this Nike shoe that's special and branded for Apple and Put it on anything else or must with it or move it to the shoelaces.

70
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:32,470
Scott: Well, I guess think about this, right?

71
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:43,416
Scott: I mean, you know shoes look different and some shoes feel different and fit people's feet Differently and some shoes are better for one thing or better for another thing, you know It makes a difference.

72
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:51,010
Scott: or I mean no shoe is gonna let you jump as high as Michael Jordan And a Chuck Taylor or in well Air Jordans.

73
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,770
Rym: There's a difference between cross trainers and running shoes, right?

74
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,597
Rym: If you're running by where cross train.

75
00:04:55,697 --> 00:05:05,730
Scott: Apple made this deal with Nike for this Nike plus thing And basically what they did is is alright We'll put this technology in the iPhone that links it with your Nike shoes so you can track.

76
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,820
Scott: You know, you're running or whatever and you know, it's it.

77
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:19,450
Scott: people are having a lot of fun these days You know having pedometers and all sorts of things like that and heart monitors to to track their physical fitness stuff Combining the workout with the technology.

78
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:31,381
Scott: So the deal with Apple and Nike did the whole point of it was Nike's like hey If we get if we're the only people who are allowed to put this technology in our clothing We'll sell a bunch of Nike shit, and then it's

79
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:31,642
Rym: not

80
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:33,550
Scott: see Nike logos all over the place.

81
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:38,476
Rym: But the patent is not for you know Someone else making a similar device?

82
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:45,757
Rym: the patent is to prevent you from taking the device that's in the Nike and putting it in Because they about Nike.

83
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:51,681
Scott: right, you know, if you were just let's say you're just trying to sell shoes Oh, wouldn't you just make the best shoe and then people would buy it.

84
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,910
Scott: but they slap Nike logos on everything.

85
00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:03,597
Scott: And the reason is because a lot of what you know clothing is is you have your brand on the clothing So people see it and if people don't see it Then it sort of defeats the purpose.

86
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:10,050
Scott: and they Nike made this deal with Apple You know, they're paying money to make sure that you know.

87
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,462
Scott: Those things are only in Nike shoes and people see.

88
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,110
Rym: Nike logos are the amazing thing.

89
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:16,601
Rym: It's not like you can pirate that sensor.

90
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,370
Rym: anyone who has that sensor?

91
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:24,010
Rym: Someone along the chain bought for money a Nike shoe that had it, right?

92
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,498
Scott: But you know if Nike what is gonna sell?

93
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:34,624
Scott: you a shoe and then somehow you were going to be able to Wear that shoe, but no one sees the Nike logos and and you're basically denying them.

94
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,850
Scott: It's like the shoe comes with advertising.

95
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,598
Scott: It's like you're taking the ads out.

96
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,110
Scott: if you're gonna take the ads out they would have charged you more.

97
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:44,326
Rym: What I like is that you basically pay for the privilege of the advertising.

98
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:45,050
Scott: I know right?

99
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,350
Scott: So it's like they're selling you a shoe that is subsidized by the advertising on the shoe.

100
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,776
Rym: It's kind of like the high school fashion.

101
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:54,270
Rym: I mean kids were I guess the Abercrombie or whatever and Abercrombie.

102
00:06:54,631 --> 00:07:05,090
Rym: Yeah, I granted I'll admit most of my clothing was from Abercrombie when I was a kid I I just had clothing that was just colors part of that just because I really only went shopping in the mall.

103
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:10,909
Rym: But anyway, it's like most of their clothing is basically just a normal t-shirt that says their brand on the front of it.

104
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:17,974
Rym: But I just I think Nike's worry too is that once the Nike shoe wears out No one's gonna buy.

105
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:21,490
Rym: well geeks at least aren't gonna buy another Nike shoe to get another sensor.

106
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,589
Rym: There's gonna keep taking the sensor and putting it on their new balances.

107
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:31,489
Scott: Yeah, cuz if you that yeah, if you if you're stuck with the shoe wears out, but the technology like that doesn't.

108
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,861
Rym: yeah Cuz the thing is I mean most people.

109
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:39,670
Rym: if you're not active I mean shoes last a long time, but if you're a runner you'll go through like two pairs of shoes a season.

110
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:41,598
Scott: No, depending on what shoe you get.

111
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:47,470
Scott: Well any if you're actually around where you run You're running like a gym and like a shit with a shiny floor.

112
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,285
Rym: No If you're a runner and you run every day even on a shiny floor gym with the best running shoes in the world Those things are gonna wear the fuck out.

113
00:07:55,601 --> 00:08:00,030
Rym: but anyway This patent like it bothers me.

114
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:06,614
Rym: The Apple fanboys came out of the woodwork and they basically said no no Apple's not being evil.

115
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:13,192
Rym: Nike is forcing them to do this because if they don't then Nike you'll get mad and they'll take their business Elsewhere.

116
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:20,014
Rym: or Nike's forced him to do it because of the licensing deal and they have to do good faith and blah blah blah blah And more and more.

117
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:22,401
Rym: I feel like I've got shenanigans on that.

118
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:26,970
Rym: I just I don't feel like Apple can use.

119
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:29,910
Scott: Apple makes the technology here.

120
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,575
Scott: They hold all the cards.

121
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:34,806
Scott: Nike is probably paying them for the exclusivity.

122
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:35,227
Rym: not yet.

123
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:43,197
Rym: every time Apple has a anyone gets mad about Apple DRM that people always seem to say no No, no, they're forcing Apple to do it.

124
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:44,322
Rym: They're forced Apple to do it.

125
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:46,310
Scott: Apple is the DRM King.

126
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,110
Scott: Yeah, this is the company that doesn't want you to put their OS on another piece of hardware.

127
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,325
Scott: It's the company that has DRM in their iTunes store.

128
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:55,330
Scott: It's the company.

129
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:57,842
Scott: All right, Apple is DRM everything.

130
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:00,192
Scott: this is not Nike's idea All right.

131
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:04,470
Rym: So speaking of DRM because I just had to talk about this but Scott let it rip.

132
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:20,050
Scott: so the one thing we've always said right is that We need a portable device that there's no Technological reason that this should not exist and shit could have existed three years ago, right the PSP basically does it?

133
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,530
Scott: Yeah a piece of portable technology with Wi-Fi and or cell phone in it.

134
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:36,461
Scott: Right that can get wireless data that can subscribe to download and play Podcasts on its own without any other device helping it.

135
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,026
Scott: There is no technological reason.

136
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,090
Scott: This couldn't happen, right?

137
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:47,066
Scott: all you need is pretty much a headphone hole a Processor some flash memory and a Wi-Fi card and a CPU.

138
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:47,748
Scott: That's all I said.

139
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:49,194
Scott: processor That's all you need.

140
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:50,400
Scott: you connect those four things.

141
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:51,023
Scott: You're done.

142
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,470
Scott: That's the whole technology right there.

143
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,110
Scott: I guess you need a screen and a user interface.

144
00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:06,350
Rym: I want to preface this whole discussion by pointing out that it is my belief and the belief of a lot of people that Podcasting and kind of independent non radio audio in general and video - yeah.

145
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,941
Rym: But I think audio is the thing that could benefit the most.

146
00:10:09,082 --> 00:10:24,979
Rym: Yeah is basically floundering and the reason it is is that People want to just listen to the radio without any effort and when they're in their car the place where most people listen To audio nowadays outside of you know cities where people do it in commutes They just turn on the radio and they just listen to.

147
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,348
Rym: they don't have to like synchronize anything prepare anything.

148
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:28,151
Rym: hit the button It's there.

149
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:32,650
Rym: they listen to something right they want to listen to something but most people hate the radio.

150
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,310
Rym: People complain about it all the time.

151
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,734
Scott: There's ads and shit.

152
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:40,750
Rym: if they could just like a bad reception to their internet radio or their internet audio.

153
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,158
Scott: Well, this is why satellite radio exists right.

154
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:46,329
Scott: satellite radio doesn't have a lot of the bad reception problems.

155
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:46,690
Scott: that what?

156
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:50,785
Scott: FM am has right and it has a billion stations.

157
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:55,770
Scott: so you can just pay and is Relatively a lot less commercials, you know, you have to pay a fee for it.

158
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,604
Scott: But you know, you basically have a satellite radio.

159
00:10:58,644 --> 00:10:59,930
Scott: you say I listen to blues music.

160
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,217
Scott: There's like three blues stations.

161
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:01,760
Scott: you pick one.

162
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,750
Scott: blues music just starts coming at the same time.

163
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,763
Rym: It's still not enough for the geeks because it's not balkanized enough.

164
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:11,736
Rym: I can't listen to the obscure weird music I like because it's not there.

165
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,787
Rym: and still none of the podcast none of the time shifted.

166
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:15,750
Rym: independent cool stuff.

167
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:18,133
Rym: Look at this Podcasting.

168
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:20,380
Scott: right as podcasting is right now.

169
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,266
Scott: You're obviously all listening to a podcast.

170
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:26,143
Scott: It's Fickle and difficult for normal people, right?

171
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,570
Scott: They have to go to a website.

172
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,103
Scott: They have to figure out RSS and subscribing.

173
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,390
Scott: they have to figure out syncing.

174
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:38,539
Scott: they have to manage the downloading and the deleting and the downloading again and the you know, The whole it's a thing to manage.

175
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:39,543
Scott: It's a lot more work.

176
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:41,030
Scott: You can't just go BAM, right?

177
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:48,074
Scott: Imagine if for example, you had a satellite radio, right but instead of all the different numbered channels It was just.

178
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:53,442
Scott: there was a GeekNights channel and you went in the GeekNights channel And then there's a list of every GeekNights episode and you picked one.

179
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,789
Scott: you push play and it just played.

180
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:57,160
Scott: right that could be.

181
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:03,281
Scott: there's no reason that technology is Doesn't exist today other than no company has bothered to make it.

182
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:10,550
Rym: and without the cell phone and without the direct on demand Why do I need to tether my stupid iPhone which has multiple ways of getting data?

183
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:11,877
Rym: Even if it's not just?

184
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,490
Rym: you know, I'm out there and I listen to things streaming real-time.

185
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:17,479
Rym: Why do I need to go to my computer to sync?

186
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,487
Rym: Why can't I just subscribe on the iPhone?

187
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:20,250
Rym: It has iTunes.

188
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:25,726
Scott: There's no reason that any device with Wi-Fi or even Bluetooth, right?

189
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:31,470
Scott: Even if it has Bluetooth I should be able to connect to my computer with Bluetooth to sync.

190
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:34,230
Scott: Why do I have to plug the device into the computer?

191
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,481
Scott: Right the Zune has to plug into the computer.

192
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:38,130
Scott: everything has to plug into the computer.

193
00:12:38,431 --> 00:12:39,814
Scott: There's no reason for that.

194
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:49,325
Scott: if I may if I was a company that made, you know, mp3 players or you know digital You know portable multimedia devices, there would be no cable.

195
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:50,630
Scott: There would be a charging cable.

196
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:51,226
Scott: That would be it.

197
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,989
Scott: The cable would only charge and everything would be over the air on its own.

198
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:57,276
Scott: now Think about what this does for a second.

199
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,222
Scott: this technology that we're talking about here.

200
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:08,407
Scott: Isn't just a convenient thing for Podcast listeners right to to be able to get a podcast say if they haven't been home in a few days?

201
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:16,150
Scott: or you know They can get a new episode if suddenly the episode shows up while they're outside and they don't have a computer handy But they have their iPod ready.

202
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:17,193
Scott: It is that.

203
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:27,381
Scott: but what it really is what this technology really is is no matter where you are You have on-demand radio on-demand radio.

204
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:28,524
Scott: Oh my god.

205
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:30,850
Scott: I mean that's even better than satellite radio satellite radio.

206
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,859
Scott: You have a hundred certain stations be it.

207
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,767
Scott: I'll listen to what the station is playing right now.

208
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:51,905
Scott: on-demand radio is listen to anything you want whenever you want at any time in any place and something that can subscribe and download and stream podcasts with Wi-Fi or cell phone is That now it's completely revolutionary.

209
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:52,710
Scott: It's amazing.

210
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,810
Scott: It would change the way people listen to everything and podcasts would suddenly explode all over the place.

211
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,539
Rym: Someone made it before we go into the news.

212
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:15,422
Rym: the other point that I need to make just in case you're not a hundred Percent aware of this, you know iTunes can do it and Apple very pointedly very on purpose disabled over the wireless Podcast to anything.

213
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:16,410
Scott: well, they didn't disable it.

214
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,313
Scott: They just this.

215
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:21,610
Scott: the iPhone has all the hardware necessary to do this in it.

216
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:23,824
Scott: It has Wi-Fi it has cell phone.

217
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:24,749
Scott: It can play mp3s.

218
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,357
Scott: Right it can.

219
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,809
Scott: that people have made RSS readers for it.

220
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:29,739
Scott: It can do it.

221
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:30,690
Scott: this hardware.

222
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:40,063
Scott: If the iPhone had no software and it was just a piece of hardware and you wrote all the software for it You can make it do that trivially up and also software.

223
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:41,066
Rym: it runs iTunes.

224
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:42,010
Scott: It does.

225
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:52,049
Scott: It can download music from the iTunes music store right over the air But it can't download a podcast episode over the air.

226
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:54,675
Scott: They just they just.

227
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:58,566
Scott: this is the thing that Apple does all the time right?

228
00:14:58,847 --> 00:14:59,248
Scott: is that?

229
00:14:59,709 --> 00:14:59,790
Scott: see?

230
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:03,863
Scott: This is why you know open-source people are so crazy.

231
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:05,510
Scott: if I have a piece of hardware, right?

232
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,069
Scott: Let's say I have a fork right I go to the store and I buy a fork.

233
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:14,416
Scott: Well, I can eat spaghetti with the fork right I can eat bread with the fork I guess right.

234
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:16,890
Scott: I can do all sorts of things of the fork.

235
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,039
Rym: I mean pry a nail out of the wall if you really want to.

236
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,851
Scott: I know a fork can do so many different things Right?

237
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:25,170
Scott: anything that you can think of to do with a fork if you bought that fork.

238
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,630
Scott: You can do it with that fork if you can think to do it, right?

239
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:34,257
Rym: But Apple likes to attach a device where and they say you can use this for for anything you want Except spaghetti fuck spaghetti.

240
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:35,982
Scott: Well, no, it's actually worse than that.

241
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,386
Scott: What it is is here.

242
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:43,010
Scott: You have bought the fork Here is the fork the fork can do nothing and here is software.

243
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:45,940
Scott: This software allows this fork to do what things.

244
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:47,024
Scott: one two and three.

245
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:52,649
Scott: the fork cannot do anything else Except for one two and three because that is the only software we have made.

246
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,250
Scott: I put that program the fork to do anything else except for these few specific things.

247
00:15:57,311 --> 00:16:01,280
Rym: I put that fork into some Unapproved spaghetti and the prongs just fall right off.

248
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:02,866
Scott: and my well, it just doesn't even go.

249
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,355
Scott: you try to put it in it It doesn't?

250
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:05,363
Scott: it's impossible.

251
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:11,507
Scott: prongs fall off The pork just flies back into the kitchen and goes in the drawer stabs your mom along the way.

252
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:19,316
Scott: Yeah, right This is why people are so crazy with Linux, right Linux might be a little difficult for normal people or whatever And I get into that right now.

253
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:22,470
Scott: The point is is do you have Linux on a piece of hardware?

254
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,954
Scott: It's open source.

255
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:30,804
Scott: if there is something that the hardware can do You can do it because the software lets you do it no matter what.

256
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:33,345
Rym: to summarize now This is before we even get into the news.

257
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:39,650
Scott: yet The iPhone and this is true not just with the iPod the iPhone but all Apple products.

258
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:51,738
Scott: OS X does not let you do everything that a Computer hardware does running on is capable of but but in some for the specific news Apple pointedly does not allow you to do this.

259
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,147
Rym: one thing that a lot of people would really like to do.

260
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:55,713
Rym: that really couldn't hurt Apple in any way.

261
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:57,901
Scott: Well, it's not that they don't allow you to do it.

262
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:08,404
Rym: It's that they have not enabled you to do it yes, but the thing is they basically you can't do it and So what could someone else let you do it?

263
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:10,010
Rym: Could you write something else to do it?

264
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:16,990
Scott: So so, of course the App Store comes out right and it's not just us that have seen this obvious gaping hole.

265
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:20,190
Scott: Everyone in the freaking podcasting universe is seen as gaping hole.

266
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:25,970
Rym: This was like the first thing when Kotaku was like, oh my god iPhone there were like can't do podcast WTF mate?

267
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,499
Scott: Well in gadget not Kotaku Kotaku doesn't care.

268
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,770
Scott: All right, but pretty much everyone wants this.

269
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,116
Scott: So of course the App Store.

270
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:35,548
Scott: it was only a matter of time before someone did it.

271
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:46,405
Scott: So someone did it and they submitted it to the I the App Store pretty much right away and It was rejected from the App Store on the grounds, right?

272
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:47,870
Scott: And here's where we start getting in trouble.

273
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,350
Scott: They made this app that basically does exactly what we said.

274
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:59,316
Scott: you can just subscribe to podcast download them or stream them audio or video over the Wi-Fi and Over the cell phone network.

275
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:02,247
Scott: just you know, wherever you have a connection to the iPhone.

276
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:02,749
Scott: It's all good.

277
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:07,690
Scott: All right, the only problem with it is because you know the way the apps on the iPhone work.

278
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:16,250
Scott: It doesn't integrate with the iPod software on the iPhone So it's not like you can add the podcast to the iPod section.

279
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,599
Scott: You can only play them, you know from within.

280
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:30,550
Scott: the you know, the plate the app itself, you know Which is a little bit annoying but it doesn't matter because it's still great even you know, forgetting that small problem right now I'm gonna play the the naive optimistic person.

281
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:39,127
Rym: So so here's here's here's my little roleplay Golly gee now I can listen to podcasts on my iPhone without having to synchronize it to my iTunes.

282
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:49,807
Scott: hot damn Yeah, well, they rejected it from the App Store and the reason they said they rejected it from the App Store was because it duplicates the functionality of iTunes.

283
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:51,110
Rym: now now now now now now now.

284
00:18:51,966 --> 00:19:01,470
Rym: so Apple won't let me Synchronize podcasts over the air with their software and if someone writes software that does just that one thing.

285
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:03,881
Rym: They say it competes with their own software.

286
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:04,745
Rym: that doesn't do that.

287
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:05,810
Scott: Here's the thing though, right?

288
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,129
Scott: This is where it gets kind of crazy.

289
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:11,810
Scott: First of all, it doesn't compete with their software because it doesn't duplicate anything.

290
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,290
Scott: It adds functionality that iTunes doesn't and the iPhone don't have.

291
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:31,570
Scott: Secondly, there are people out there making apps for the iPhone such as weather apps and calculator apps and all sorts of other apps That do just duplicate existing functionality of the iPhone and iTunes and don't do anything else.

292
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:34,040
Scott: so those apps are allowed in.

293
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:35,807
Scott: yet this one isn't.

294
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:40,523
Scott: and The only thing is puzzling is why don't they want this technology?

295
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:45,625
Scott: now this turn on competing, you know, they They're not friends with the satellite radio.

296
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:46,510
Scott: What do they give a shit about?

297
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,330
Rym: No, that's why this is such an important and interesting news because this tells us something.

298
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:54,169
Rym: This tells us that there's something we don't know.

299
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:58,544
Rym: There's some specific reason Apple does not want us to have this functionality.

300
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:02,136
Rym: because I mean before I mean They could have had a bunch of internal reasons.

301
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:06,110
Rym: I mean, you know dev teams are they might say well this feature blah blah blah.

302
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,261
Rym: Let's just not bother with it.

303
00:20:07,282 --> 00:20:11,787
Rym: They could have a bunch of Semibs, but good enough reasons, you know, who cares?

304
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:20,147
Rym: it's a company they whatever they want, but the fact that they didn't include it and then they very Specifically disallow this means that there's something.

305
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:27,510
Rym: there's some Specific direct reason why Apple as a policy reason does not want us to get I to get podcasts over the air.

306
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:30,077
Scott: And this is this is something that people want.

307
00:20:30,198 --> 00:20:34,953
Scott: millions like millions of people want this and people who don't even know they want it Yeah on it.

308
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:36,098
Rym: So this doesn't exist.

309
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:36,882
Rym: That's the question.

310
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:37,726
Rym: What is it?

311
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:38,510
Rym: What is the reason?

312
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:41,037
Rym: Why does Apple not want this Apple?

313
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:43,584
Scott: Why is no company just jumped on this?

314
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:49,998
Scott: I mean, well the PSP Is too big I know but it's the zoo.

315
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:52,065
Scott: and did this everyone would have Zunes.

316
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:53,830
Scott: what the fuck is Microsoft smoking?

317
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,719
Rym: But what's I mean, I'm really creative.

318
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,966
Scott: creative makes a million every SanDisk.

319
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:00,150
Scott: There's so many Samsung.

320
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:06,047
Scott: someone do it good and this is why right this is what open source is all about.

321
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:13,639
Scott: if the Hardware is the only thing that actually requires a big company and money and all this You know such with open source.

322
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,649
Scott: if it can't be done and people want it to get done It gets done.

323
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:19,250
Scott: No If they're you know.

324
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:28,661
Scott: If somehow right instead of having like portable devices that were controlled by companies portable devices were like PCs or you just could put whatever operating system on there you wanted.

325
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:30,970
Scott: all of them would do this every single one of them.

326
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:33,322
Rym: It would be you know, but but still I like.

327
00:21:33,382 --> 00:21:34,428
Rym: I really I want to know.

328
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:36,185
Rym: I'm curious What do you guys out there think like?

329
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:39,449
Rym: Why what is it that I mean?

330
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,830
Rym: Do they think it'll compete with them selling stuff in the iTunes to podcast?

331
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:54,688
Scott: I mean if they were worried about podcasts actually like succeeding and somehow Nobody pays for any music or listens to any streaming radio or anything anymore.

332
00:21:54,768 --> 00:22:01,181
Scott: ever, you know It kills satellite FM and iTunes store and everything and suddenly Podcasts are the only thing left.

333
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:06,080
Scott: if they're worried about that Why do they even have podcasts and iTunes in the first place?

334
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,410
Rym: maybe because they added it and then you know to get iTunes out There and then they kind of don't want it to get any further and they're just hoping it'll die quietly.

335
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,683
Scott: Because you know if iTunes didn't have podcasting at all wouldn't use an iPod.

336
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,245
Scott: That's for sure.

337
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:22,510
Rym: Yeah, I definitely wouldn't either I. I basically only use my iPod because it does podcasting better than anything else.

338
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,694
Scott: And that's another thing right.

339
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:28,110
Scott: even if no one else is gonna go for the wireless podcast go for the big score.

340
00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:32,967
Scott: Why don't you at least just do podcasts as well as iTunes does it?

341
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:33,689
Scott: everyone else is?

342
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,434
Scott: Podcasting it does.

343
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,358
Scott: they do it like poop.

344
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,124
Scott: It's like completely useless.

345
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:40,637
Rym: even well part of that I think is just it's a catch-22.

346
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:49,750
Scott: not even like not Applications like Amarok and and such and such don't do podcasting on their own, but that's really good as iTunes does.

347
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,466
Rym: It's really obvious why that it's a catch-22.

348
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:57,630
Rym: Not enough people listen to podcasts for anyone to care about doing that because not enough people isn't a podcast.

349
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:58,757
Rym: There's no benefit to be had.

350
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:10,283
Rym: but there's a difference between Apple saying it's not worth our effort to support this in any way and Apple saying we're going to pointedly You from doing this even when someone else did all the work for us.

351
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:11,910
Rym: yeah, so the story doesn't end there.

352
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:12,633
Scott: No, it doesn't.

353
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:13,716
Rym: so that this is.

354
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:15,684
Rym: this is where this is why we're talking about this.

355
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:20,852
Rym: everyone get ready to raise a big finger in the sky alright, so Normally right.

356
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:27,069
Scott: the only way to get software onto your iPhone is to either get it from the App Store or jailbreak right.

357
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:33,970
Scott: well The people who made this podcasting software that was rejected from iTunes have come up with something better.

358
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:35,292
Scott: Alright.

359
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:41,132
Scott: basically what they've done is first of all you go to their website and watch a video of the software to be suitably Impressed.

360
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:44,104
Scott: they're not GeekNights listeners, but you know they listen to.

361
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:45,650
Scott: you know all the all the podcasts.

362
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,527
Scott: You know the tech ones like the twits and the buzz out loud and all those things right.

363
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:59,895
Scott: anyway They have made their software Available to people who have not jailbroken their iPhones But not through the App Store.

364
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:03,287
Scott: the way they've set it up as far as I can tell right is.

365
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:14,667
Scott: you go to their website You give them her email address Then you give them the UD ID which is basically the unique Identifying number from your iPhone and they have instructions to tell you how to you know.

366
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:15,310
Scott: give them the number.

367
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:16,876
Scott: You give them the number.

368
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:20,470
Scott: what it appears to me is they're taking this number putting it in there.

369
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:25,204
Scott: You know I iPhone dev kit, or you know iPod touch dev kit or whatever.

370
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:27,677
Scott: Yeah, I think it has to be iPhone I'm not sure.

371
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:35,010
Scott: and then They are using that to deliver the software to you via their dev kit it seems.

372
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:42,990
Scott: So they're basically circumventing the App Store to get this app out there because they care about it that much.

373
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:48,030
Rym: Okay, so one what this means is that Apple is going to sue the fuck out of them.

374
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:49,730
Scott: So we're gonna see what happens here.

375
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,000
Scott: But I totally I'm going for it all out.

376
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,150
Rym: everyone out there jump on this now.

377
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:57,140
Rym: The more of us have it the more damage we can do.

378
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,240
Rym: yeah,

379
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:17,506
Scott: of course you know people are speculating about you know Apple being able to remotely delete things and such and such and such But I I hope there's some sort of court action where we bring to light some sort of like you know industry Conspiracy or you know collusion to prevent a particular technology from coming into existence.

380
00:25:17,546 --> 00:25:20,573
Scott: that would be obviously Beneficial or something like.

381
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:27,061
Rym: I mean it might be far-fetched to say that like the technology industry at large has some sort of consortium or conspiracy.

382
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:38,001
Rym: yeah It is a little crazy But it is not at all crazy to say that Apple very specifically is trying to keep this under wraps And why I don't understand why they don't want to do it.

383
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:42,157
Scott: if if Steve Jobs said enough I think about this Steve Jobs Just did his little announcement.

384
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:44,270
Scott: He's like new nanos yada yada yada right?

385
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:48,302
Scott: Imagine if his announcement instead was new nanos.

386
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:52,202
Scott: by the way the nanos have Wi-Fi and by the way Over-the-air podcast.

387
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:53,069
Scott: people would be going.

388
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:56,454
Scott: Instead people are going.

389
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,420
Scott: yeah boring you got nothing good.

390
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,503
Scott: We didn't get new MacBooks.

391
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:01,970
Scott: Fuck you Steve come back next time, right?

392
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:04,056
Scott: It's so easy.

393
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:07,670
Scott: It's like a pile of gold is sitting there, and no one's picking it up.

394
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:10,350
Scott: But we can't pick it up because we don't make hardware.

395
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:19,083
Scott: If I somehow got money from some like any investor at all I would just do this immediately, and I'd be immediately rich.

396
00:26:19,164 --> 00:26:20,390
Scott: It's a guaranteed hit.

397
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:21,817
Scott: I don't even care.

398
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:24,068
Scott: if no one has me do it someone else do it.

399
00:26:24,108 --> 00:26:33,256
Rym: good God Things of the day.

400
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:41,221
Rym: so actually this is one of my favorite movies even though It's a terrible movie for from almost any perspective.

401
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:55,225
Rym: It's full of one-liners bad special effects the plot is uh Hilarious and the thing is it's hilarious partly because it takes itself completely Seriously almost the whole way through this movie is the running man.

402
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:56,610
Scott: what the running man is not terrible.

403
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,339
Scott: What's wrong with the running man is awesome.

404
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:00,228
Rym: that movie is terrible and all.

405
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:03,197
Scott: no It's just awesome and a non-ironic fat.

406
00:27:03,217 --> 00:27:04,601
Rym: wait wait wait wait now terrible.

407
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:14,049
Rym: Scott you realize that the word terrible and the word awesome Depending on what definition you use and what connotations you bring along have very similar meanings.

408
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,590
Rym: I've been the terrible the awesome and powerful.

409
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:18,792
Scott: Right.

410
00:27:18,832 --> 00:27:23,790
Scott: well it is awesome and the running man is a fine piece of cinema.

411
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,256
Rym: Money big prizes.

412
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:32,604
Scott: I could maybe I'd have to actually make a list.

413
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:46,569
Scott: it might make my top 100 but maybe 200, but it's way up there, and you know cuz there's so many movies Good ones, but he says I'll be back, and he's totally back But not for like a half-hour.

414
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:48,635
Scott: Anyway, I love the running man.

415
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:49,277
Scott: It's great.

416
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:50,480
Rym: It is a great movie.

417
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,130
Rym: It is great awesome, and it's fantastic and not terrible.

418
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:55,463
Rym: It is very much terrible.

419
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:58,626
Rym: good Lee awesome and terrible.

420
00:27:58,646 --> 00:28:01,038
Rym: good Period it is goodly.

421
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:14,379
Rym: now anyway what I have for you is the original theatrical Trailer to the running man, and let me tell you in the era before Thunderthroat movie trailers Really really sucked.

422
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:15,849
Scott: does that mean they're gonna suck again?

423
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:16,995
Rym: I don't know.

424
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:17,900
Rym: because I don't.

425
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,282
Rym: I don't know.

426
00:28:18,302 --> 00:28:19,850
Rym: I haven't seen any movie trailers in a while.

427
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,149
Rym: I haven't gone to a theater.

428
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:26,797
Rym: I mean the thing is well I see like a lot of independent film movie trailers But they're never like normal movie.

429
00:28:26,817 --> 00:28:26,917
Rym: Well.

430
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:27,983
Scott: They don't hire Thunder through.

431
00:28:28,003 --> 00:28:28,204
Scott: well.

432
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:28,908
Scott: No one's hired him.

433
00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:32,559
Rym: now Someday, we're gonna have the capability to just recreate his voice.

434
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,369
Scott: perfectly well start smoking now, and you'll you'll get there.

435
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:38,270
Rym: No, I'll probably just sound like this in about five minutes.

436
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:42,690
Scott: No, that's what you're gonna sound like when you're 80 when that the mid-range in your 50s sound great.

437
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:51,890
Rym: Yeah But anyway because that's not enough of a thing of the day The bonus pack because they both have the same word in the title at least the same root word.

438
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:56,989
Rym: I have the three minute long theatrical trailer to Logan's run.

439
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:02,429
Rym: now If you think that movie trailers from the running man era are bad.

440
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:14,355
Rym: Feast your eyes and ears upon the terribly good trailer To the running man, which is also a fantastically Awesomely terrible movie.

441
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:17,647
Scott: I could go on a slight tangent about comics for a minute if you want.

442
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:19,921
Rym: That's fine Okay, so check this out right.

443
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:22,620
Rym: I'm checking at PAX Ken Levine.

444
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,470
Scott: he was given the keynote.

445
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:30,799
Scott: Oh, yeah He talked about how he was buying the Logan's run comic when he was a kid right and how it disappeared Because there was no internet.

446
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,770
Rym: he had no way to know what happened to it, right?

447
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,719
Scott: And of course it was canceled cuz no one's buying it.

448
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,690
Scott: Well, I'm a fan.

449
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:51,396
Scott: You know, I mean, they're not big on the superheroes obviously if you haven't listened to a Wednesday episode, but in Marvel Comics There's the Cosmics which are basically it's all the comics about what happens in space, you know It's not about Iron Man and Captain America.

450
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,646
Scott: It's about the Silver Surfer and Galactus Thanatos, right?

451
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:59,250
Rym: Right exactly Oh Thanos I don't read any of that underwear pervert crap, right?

452
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,230
Scott: So there's a dude Adam Warlock in space and he's pretty fucking awesome.

453
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,474
Scott: he's he's my man, right.

454
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:11,963
Scott: and the thing is I've never read like the old old old Adam Warlock comics and Recently Marvel came out with this hardcover.

455
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,770
Scott: That's like Annihilation classic.

456
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:15,415
Scott: It's like it's basically.

457
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:21,278
Scott: they took a bunch of classic space comics put them in a book and that and they sort of labeled them with the same label.

458
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:26,909
Scott: that's on the new space comics and it's sort of like Hey read this to get some background information on the new space comics, right?

459
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,790
Scott: And there's an Adam Warlock comic in there that I kind of want to read and there's some Rocket Raccoon and whatever.

460
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:35,892
Scott: But Logan's run number six is in there Six.

461
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,955
Rym: Yeah that far.

462
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:41,589
Scott: I think there must be something in Logan's run number six that ties it into the.

463
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:45,200
Scott: You know Marvel something there.

464
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,204
Rym: There can't be.

465
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:47,469
Scott: there must be what?

466
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:52,165
Scott: But I'm not gonna buy the book to find out because it's hardcover only.

467
00:30:52,205 --> 00:30:56,068
Scott: but if it's ever softcover I'm gonna buy it and find all this easier way on a Wednesday.

468
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:58,718
Rym: Just ask people to tell you what the link is.

469
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,806
Rym: someone out there is gonna own that thing.

470
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:01,870
Rym: Maybe anyway.

471
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:03,777
Scott: So check out this news.

472
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:04,360
Scott: Thank you.

473
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,346
Scott: thing of the day not news.

474
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:05,989
Scott: I did my news.

475
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:12,230
Scott: So it's you know, the US military has good and bad parts of it, you know.

476
00:31:12,531 --> 00:31:16,950
Scott: But the best part of it according to Scott good parts made the internet bad parts killing people.

477
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:21,473
Scott: Exactly is that the good parts are that we give it so much money In order to spend?

478
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:38,341
Scott: because in the way government works is you get money from the government and that if you're a government Department or agency and if you don't spend all the money Let's say I get I own a lab a government lab and they give me a million dollars one year for my budget and I spend 800,000 they'll say oh, I guess you didn't need a million.

479
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:42,056
Scott: Here's only 800,000 next year and you go fuck Right good.

480
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:44,570
Scott: And then if you try to do something more well now you're SOL.

481
00:31:45,491 --> 00:32:01,602
Scott: So the you know military gets lots and lots of money and since a lot of that money goes to defense contractors those defense contractors say hey if we want to make more money the only way for us to make more money because you don't have any customers but the government right is to tell the government to increase the military budget.

482
00:32:01,943 --> 00:32:06,964
Scott: and it goes in a cycle basically of the Military spends all its money on research and making shit.

483
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:13,210
Scott: then the government You know has to increase that budget because the contractors make them and because they're the ones who get the money in the end.

484
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:30,366
Scott: And so on and so forth and the result of this despite it being sort of bad in many ways you know with the military industrial complex is that many many awesome technologies are developed and Many of those, you know besides, you know, the ones that are pretty much only military use like space death lasers

485
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:30,927
Rym: are

486
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:31,910
Scott: used for.

487
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:39,510
Scott: You know civilian things later on like the internet which is meant for one thing but is now meant for me talking to you right now.

488
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:56,206
Scott: So one thing military has developed right is basically little you know Unmanned like like flying little airplane guys, right so That was some eloquence right that was.

489
00:32:56,226 --> 00:33:03,130
Scott: I mean Spy drone basically like a robot spy plane, but like a big spy plane like a little one that you could hold.

490
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:04,738
Rym: But yes, I would use the word drone.

491
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,010
Scott: Yeah, it's not as small as like a paper airplane.

492
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,644
Scott: It's like about a you know meter wide or so, maybe like that.

493
00:33:09,664 --> 00:33:11,554
Scott: It's hard to tell, you know It's pretty big.

494
00:33:11,594 --> 00:33:14,310
Scott: you pick it up and you can throw it right, but it's it's big.

495
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:21,486
Scott: It's like as wide as you know a person or wider than a person Right and you throw it and then it flies to its pre-programmed destination.

496
00:33:21,547 --> 00:33:22,309
Scott: It's got like a GPS.

497
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:27,890
Scott: It's got little motors to control the rudders and such, you know, it's got a motor to keep it going.

498
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,493
Scott: You know a little propeller whatever it is in the back and you know You can.

499
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:43,390
Scott: you could put like a camera on one of these throw it Program it to fly over the enemy base take a bunch of pictures It comes back with the pictures or transmits the pictures to you over the air or something like that, right?

500
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:49,985
Scott: it's a military technology and You know, we try to think of what use could this technology have for the civilians.

501
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:57,570
Scott: and you think well I guess you know, you could use it for fun right like use an RC helicopter for fun, right?

502
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,993
Scott: but what you know.

503
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:06,990
Scott: or you could use it for sort of mundane things like spy in your neighbor or Follow your kids around if you're remote control it or something like that, right?

504
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:12,286
Scott: But they have found perhaps the best use of this technology for civilian purposes.

505
00:34:12,346 --> 00:34:13,449
Rym: What Scott could it be?

506
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,649
Scott: Do you know what it is now?

507
00:34:15,451 --> 00:34:22,094
Scott: so basically what they did is they slapped two red crosses on the bottom of it, right and in Africa.

508
00:34:22,356 --> 00:34:33,509
Scott: what they do with these now, or at least what some people are doing with these is they go out and they get like You know some blood samples and then they throw it and then it goes to the lab.

509
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,592
Rym: Brilliant, right?

510
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:37,056
Scott: It does more than that, right?

511
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:41,409
Scott: Oh, no, I'm in the jungle and I got bit by the poison spider.

512
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:49,114
Scott: I make a phone call they attach the antidote to the plane and they throw it and it comes to me with the anecdotes How does it know where you are?

513
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:52,284
Scott: They know basically they know where you are because you have a GPS.

514
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:57,819
Scott: they program the GPS cord Flies itself like you tell it where to go.

515
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:00,788
Scott: you throw it and it gets there the vast majority of the time.

516
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:04,709
Scott: it can go Against winds that are like 40 kilometers an hour and get there.

517
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:09,110
Rym: I can think of another thing to use this for right totally awesome note passing.

518
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:11,556
Scott: Well, yeah Yeah, but you know you could.

519
00:35:11,616 --> 00:35:15,250
Scott: basically I think they said it can carry 500 grams or something like that.

520
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,138
Scott: So you can carry a lot of shit this thing.

521
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:22,130
Rym: I can think of another use for it suddenly, but awesome drug dealing.

522
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:30,256
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna paint mine black You know throw it at night.

523
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:31,561
Rym: I realized this.

524
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:32,485
Rym: that's gonna be like.

525
00:35:32,545 --> 00:35:33,930
Rym: that's not that far from the future.

526
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:36,118
Rym: No, it's not that far from the future at all.

527
00:35:36,238 --> 00:35:36,901
Scott: No, it's not.

528
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:39,370
Rym: that's like the best way to deal drugs and not get caught.

529
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:42,155
Scott: Oh my gosh, right You can just throw these right.

530
00:35:42,336 --> 00:35:48,094
Scott: you get Western Union's fuck cuz all the people if they want to send their money back Right over the face.

531
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:52,590
Rym: already a big problem where people are smuggling cell phones and drugs and things into prisons.

532
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:57,795
Rym: My shooting have this thing like shooting model rockets over the walls Which is trivial to do.

533
00:35:57,815 --> 00:36:04,002
Rym: I can shoot a model rocket into the downstate correctional facility From my window if I want to do.

534
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:04,767
Rym: it's right there.

535
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:11,247
Scott: Yep So yeah, these are getting pretty good with these things and I'd like I'd like to have one.

536
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:12,632
Scott: that'd be pretty cool I think.

537
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:13,555
Rym: how much are they?

538
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:14,499
Rym: I don't know.

539
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,021
Rym: just buy it.

540
00:36:15,202 --> 00:36:16,046
Scott: I don't think it's a thing for sale.

541
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,859
Scott: It's like a military technology here.

542
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:20,729
Scott: You're not gonna have a hard time getting one someday.

543
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:25,042
Scott: I'll get one someday someday, but right now it's.

544
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:25,563
Scott: it's just cool.

545
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,870
Scott: and there's a video and there's an article on new scientist.

546
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:28,633
Scott: That's it.

547
00:36:29,215 --> 00:36:32,546
Rym: So I realized we've never really talked.

548
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:33,670
Scott: I was the one who realized it.

549
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:39,274
Rym: Well, we realized we've never really talked about this and it came up in a somewhat unrelated conversation.

550
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:40,119
Scott: that's I sort of.

551
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:47,997
Scott: I was thought up an idea and Simultaneously thinking up the idea realized we hadn't talked about what the topic of yeah I was like, what if we did this?

552
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:49,726
Rym: and I was like ipv6 already does that?

553
00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:52,441
Scott: well No, I was saying what if we did this with ipv6?

554
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,024
Scott: will it work?

555
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:54,069
Scott: That's what I said.

556
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:55,997
Rym: Yeah, well the thing is the idea.

557
00:36:56,037 --> 00:36:58,688
Rym: we're not gonna get into the idea, but basically we haven't talked about ipv6.

558
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,315
Scott: No, we haven't.

559
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:00,878
Rym: Of course.

560
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:07,890
Rym: It's kind of moot because ipv6 is Not moving quickly in at least as far as any of you would ever be concerned.

561
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:11,725
Scott: No Basically people who don't realize this right right now.

562
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:13,933
Scott: people talk about IP Addresses and such.

563
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:20,430
Scott: the internet and all your home networks pretty much unless you know and everything, you know about the internet is ipv4.

564
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:22,515
Scott: Everything is ipv4.

565
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:23,842
Scott: I bet you didn't even know.

566
00:37:23,862 --> 00:37:29,972
Rym: there was a one two and three, you know 127.0.0.1 IP addresses IP Version.

567
00:37:30,052 --> 00:37:34,843
Scott: for yeah, that is it's the fourth version of the IP internet protocol.

568
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:37,329
Rym: now before anyone says so what's ipv5?

569
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,951
Rym: It's something unrelated involving streaming Don't?

570
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:44,004
Rym: it's the same reason why all the 802.11 some things are completely different things.

571
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:44,545
Rym: There's no rhyme.

572
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:47,393
Scott: It's like why was there a Bg?

573
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:48,680
Scott: what happened to CDE?

574
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,545
Rym: and they're all there.

575
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:50,430
Rym: you can look up the list.

576
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,197
Rym: You don't care about what any of them are.

577
00:37:52,258 --> 00:37:55,472
Scott: believe the only ones that are important to you are the ones that you see letters for.

578
00:37:55,512 --> 00:38:01,313
Scott: you know H I J K LM are not important to you and is a Wasn't too important.

579
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:02,437
Scott: Well, it's.

580
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:05,870
Scott: it's a little bit a little more important than any of those other letters besides BG and N.

581
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:12,026
Rym: Yeah, but 802.11 not 802.11. god ipv5 basically pretend it doesn't exist ipv6.

582
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:13,630
Rym: now the deal is pretty simple.

583
00:38:14,951 --> 00:38:28,409
Rym: ipv4 and what we use as IP addresses was conceived and put together a long time ago when the world was very different and when when the government still owned the internet and things were broken up into classes and routing was pretty simple.

584
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:33,909
Rym: and there are a lot more devices than anyone ever expected or intended on the internet.

585
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:44,748
Rym: and The only reason we're still able to use ipv4 is by Continually hacking it together and making little changes and netting and cider.

586
00:38:44,828 --> 00:38:52,150
Scott: and yeah Basically ipv4 on its own is not capable of handling the internet as it is today.

587
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:54,464
Scott: In order to make the internet work.

588
00:38:54,726 --> 00:39:04,879
Scott: We have somehow Miraculously, I don't know how it happened I'm amazed that it works every day built all these other technologies on top of Ipv4 to make it work.

589
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,928
Scott: We've made crazy routers Unbelievably crazy routers that shouldn't have to be made but they were made and now they need.

590
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:12,390
Scott: we need them.

591
00:39:12,631 --> 00:39:15,210
Scott: We've made NAT which is something we never would have needed.

592
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:22,330
Scott: Well net net and pad that has some uses other than that But really we wouldn't need net if ipv4 wasn't poop.

593
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:30,050
Rym: However, the thing is a lot of interesting things have come out of this like for example because everyone is using well Technically, you know someone says they have a net router.

594
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:45,870
Rym: No, you have a pat router because it's port address translation, but I digress That that like the proliferation of that sort of network design for consumers has actually gone a long way to Protecting you from the terrible secret of space aka the real internet.

595
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:55,210
Scott: Yeah, and ipv4 the biggest problem with it long run problem Is that even with NAT right you will run out of addresses?

596
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:05,106
Scott: Eventually, I mean the biggest address you can have is 255 285 285 285 and that's not a lot of the addresses You can't even use because they don't you know, they're not real addresses.

597
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:05,990
Scott: They're special for something.

598
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,943
Rym: Here's the thing any sort of hierarchical system like that kind of like phone numbers.

599
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,119
Rym: when they originally conceived and area codes They were used in an era.

600
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,276
Rym: I mean there were no cell phones There was no phone number portability.

601
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:27,299
Rym: phone numbers to a large degree, you know area codes and all those different like parts of a phone number Denoted geographical areas for purposes of routing phone calls.

602
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:33,880
Rym: and that became increasingly useless with things like cell phones and routing got really complicated.

603
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:51,270
Rym: and actually one of the biggest failings of ipv4 is that Routing became incredibly complex because we wanted you know We wanted to split up the way networks were originally designated and the hierarchy went all to shit And they used to attach right the numbers to the physical world.

604
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:56,030
Scott: So they would say oh your number is you know this well that means it's in New York somewhere.

605
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:09,941
Scott: So now we know to route it over this cable and it was basically by having that that that tie-in Between the structure of the numbers and the structure of the real world Setting up routing was really easy and simple.

606
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,507
Scott: It was just sort of like oh this goes that way.

607
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:12,310
Scott: this goes that way.

608
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:13,854
Scott: You do anything complex.

609
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:20,695
Rym: you could simplify routes like you knew all the 129 dot anythings are gonna be in that direction From all these different locations.

610
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:24,630
Rym: you even care what's actually over there or where specifically it is.

611
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,930
Rym: You just know that way that way that way.

612
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,630
Scott: So if you had like three different, you know network connections coming out of your router.

613
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:33,670
Scott: I go and you know one goes west one goes east one goes north.

614
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:38,267
Scott: You pretty much say this third of the IP addresses go left this third go right this third go north.

615
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,725
Scott: all done Right easy easy as pie.

616
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:43,358
Rym: now, of course We're grossly oversimplifying but of

617
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:43,980
Scott: course like

618
00:41:44,281 --> 00:42:07,590
Rym: one example of how we've really hacked this together is It wasn't that long ago that cider CID our classless inner domain routing was introduced and this was basically To break up the very rigid structure of IP addresses in order to allow us to take advantage of addresses that existed That due to the structure of the way we used IP addresses couldn't actually be used.

619
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:19,090
Rym: It's kind of like if you built a house but in order to support the house you had to build this big column in the middle of the house and Inside of that column which was a big square was void space that could not be accept.

620
00:42:19,231 --> 00:42:22,390
Rym: It was in no way accessible to people just because of the way you built the house.

621
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:27,050
Rym: You know, there was like it was used for pipes and stuff, but now you really need that extra space.

622
00:42:27,431 --> 00:42:38,610
Rym: So you tore down all those walls and basically rebuilt the inside of the house with this very Complex and incredibly difficult to understand system just to use that extra space that was there anyway, but inaccessible.

623
00:42:39,052 --> 00:42:43,089
Rym: but as a result you lost a lot of the advantages of the original structural design.

624
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:50,583
Rym: and I'm not gonna explain how cider works But for anyone who has a little like just enough knowledge to be dangerous.

625
00:42:51,145 --> 00:42:52,810
Rym: Here's the simplest way I can explain it.

626
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,141
Rym: I hope you can figure out the rest.

627
00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:07,040
Rym: a Class C address is the old way of talking about something, you know a subnet mask 255 255 255 dot zero Nowadays, that's a slash 24.

628
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,687
Rym: I hope you can figure out the rest from there.

629
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:23,750
Scott: Yeah Anyway, so we had this crazy system that's way old and antiquated But somehow we have put things on top of it and modified it and come up with different things To make it still work for modern purposes.

630
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,355
Scott: But it's also

631
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:39,690
Rym: partly due to the unintended, you know Part of the reason we thought we'd run out of addresses is that as more and more people got Devices that were capable of going online, you know every cell phone every computer every chair every every refrigerator gets online You suddenly run out of public IP addresses.

632
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:52,658
Rym: but it's turned out that that that future never really came to be and all the devices that are becoming online are largely passive or hidden or They're not really content publishers to the world.

633
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:56,830
Rym: They're content publishers to local subnets or their content receivers.

634
00:43:57,091 --> 00:44:00,650
Rym: I mean, no one's hosting a web page on their cell phone, right?

635
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:06,363
Scott: We've been able to use Nat slash Pat to avoid that problem.

636
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:08,449
Scott: pretty much come almost completely.

637
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:14,230
Scott: but one day That problem will happen and we will run out of IP addresses.

638
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:17,624
Scott: He's gonna be really slow a lot slower than we thought it was gonna be years ago.

639
00:44:17,664 --> 00:44:18,427
Scott: We years ago.

640
00:44:18,468 --> 00:44:19,793
Scott: We were like, oh shit We're gonna run out.

641
00:44:19,954 --> 00:44:21,198
Rym: I mean dude in high school.

642
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:25,234
Rym: I remember saying oh man, we need IP v6 We're fucked right.

643
00:44:25,315 --> 00:44:27,383
Scott: and then you know, Nat sort of saved the day.

644
00:44:27,403 --> 00:44:34,616
Scott: and people realized though We're not gonna run out but we are going to run out in a while 15 years.

645
00:44:34,696 --> 00:44:36,400
Rym: really it's cider that saved the day.

646
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,030
Scott: But anyway that too those two things combined have saved the day regardless.

647
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:53,648
Scott: IP v6 is the long-term solution and it has many other Advantages and the really the only disadvantage of IP v6 is that everyone has to switch and it's a pain in the

648
00:44:53,809 --> 00:45:02,234
Rym: ass Yeah, but at the same time there are a lot of ways to make that transition and there is actually a lot of infrastructure that None of you can see.

649
00:45:02,716 --> 00:45:04,845
Rym: that is IP v6 compatible.

650
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:05,990
Rym: IP v6 works.

651
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:10,128
Rym: There are ways to tunnel IP v4 and IP v6 through each other also IP v6.

652
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:25,545
Rym: The first thing you'll notice about IP v6 right is that the IP addresses aren't easy to remember which in a way is good because IP addresses are Really this kind of back end that you shouldn't need to know anymore kind of.

653
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:27,050
Rym: it's a bad analogy.

654
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,568
Rym: But in the old days, I knew someone's phone number and if I didn't I looked it up.

655
00:45:32,171 --> 00:45:36,790
Rym: Nowadays, I kind of cashed my knowledge of the phone number in my cell phone.

656
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:45,393
Rym: I don't know a single per human beings phone number in the world now except my own and my cell phone My own.

657
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:48,705
Rym: well, I know my own because I memorized it a long time ago.

658
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:49,869
Scott: I'm still memorizing my.

659
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:54,199
Scott: Anyway, so IP v4 addresses.

660
00:45:54,259 --> 00:45:57,589
Scott: you've seen IP addresses like 192 dot something that's on the Sun, right?

661
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:58,751
Scott: IP v6.

662
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,576
Scott: here's an example IP v6.

663
00:46:00,736 --> 00:46:06,090
Rym: It is eight groups of four digit hexadecimal numbers, right?

664
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:15,100
Scott: So it's 32 symbols and the symbols could be anything between 0 and F. So 0 1 to the rise of 89 ABC de hexadecimal.

665
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:33,689
Scott: so I could have f f1 a b7 for a One one one one one four one one, you know It could be 32 F's and there's a colon in between every set of four F. So four F's colon four F's colon four F's colon and then one two, three, four five more sets of four F's.

666
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:41,557
Rym: Granted that that's a. I mean the the colons and things are just to make it easier to remember and write kind of like the dots In IP v4 exactly.

667
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,409
Scott: So if you think about that, right how many?

668
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,494
Scott: Impossible?

669
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:50,655
Scott: how if we used every IP v4 address in the world How many addresses?

670
00:46:50,755 --> 00:46:55,810
Rym: would that be far fewer than you think because most of them are useless, right?

671
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:59,330
Scott: Well, even if all of them were useful, right?

672
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,536
Scott: That's 255 times 255 times 285 times 285, right?

673
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:02,439
Scott: That's let's see.

674
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:10,763
Rym: I'm surprised you didn't do this calculation ahead of time and or have it memorized.

675
00:47:10,783 --> 00:47:13,856
Scott: I think it's like 4.2 billion Addresses.

676
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,889
Rym: maybe there's a much simpler way to put it.

677
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,013
Rym: IP v4 is 32-bit.

678
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:17,455
Rym: Yeah, it's 32 bits.

679
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:23,573
Rym: IP v6 is 128 bits.

680
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:33,469
Rym: that is more IP addresses than like the entire current population of the world Per square meter of surface area of the world with plenty to spare.

681
00:47:33,993 --> 00:47:35,966
Scott: Exactly, you could if we used IP v6.

682
00:47:36,871 --> 00:47:39,683
Scott: That means you could have right.

683
00:47:39,743 --> 00:47:49,219
Scott: billions of IP addresses billions of billions of IP addresses and billions in one square inch of the surface of the earth.

684
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:59,318
Scott: in other words if One day we want to have like nanobots and we want every single nanobot to have its own IP address IP v6 can do that with no problem.

685
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,221
Scott: It's like yeah, whatever.

686
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:01,725
Scott: We got IP address to spare.

687
00:48:01,866 --> 00:48:02,287
Scott: go nuts.

688
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:02,828
Scott: We're good.

689
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:09,030
Rym: now It's actually like the ramifications of such a large address space go far beyond.

690
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:11,158
Rym: OMG will never run out of IP addresses.

691
00:48:11,218 --> 00:48:29,762
Rym: and I kind of want to spend a little bit of time just talking about you know This is kind of the the primer to think about what you can do when given more Resources than you need because usually as computer scientists or IT people We're always in the situation of do as much as you can with as little as possible.

692
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:31,426
Rym: Here's 4k of RAM.

693
00:48:31,747 --> 00:48:32,610
Rym: write that program.

694
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:33,922
Rym: Here's 5 bucks.

695
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:34,729
Rym: make that network.

696
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:38,802
Rym: IP v6 is the equivalent of here's a billion dollars.

697
00:48:38,863 --> 00:48:40,207
Rym: connect those two computers together.

698
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:43,084
Rym: Yeah, and Now now think about this.

699
00:48:43,831 --> 00:48:49,395
Rym: Currently, you know, we have I have a computer and I don't want to you know program the IP address every time I use it.

700
00:48:49,435 --> 00:48:52,659
Rym: We use something called DHCP Dynamic host configuration protocol.

701
00:48:53,101 --> 00:48:58,962
Rym: it basically is the thing where I turn on my computer It gets an IP address from another source from my links is right.

702
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:02,696
Scott: when you when you have a computer with IP v4 There's two things you can do.

703
00:49:02,736 --> 00:49:17,036
Scott: you can either type into that computer with your hands This is your IP address computer or you can have a server on the network And when the computer turns on it'll talk to that server on the network and say hey server on the network What's my IP address?

704
00:49:17,057 --> 00:49:18,062
Scott: and the server will tell it.

705
00:49:18,344 --> 00:49:22,490
Scott: or it'll say no fuck you You're not getting one right, but you have to set up this server.

706
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:22,792
Scott: You have to.

707
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:28,221
Scott: actually can someone somewhere your network administrator Had set up the server with their own hand?

708
00:49:28,261 --> 00:49:30,129
Rym: or if you have a links as routers does it?

709
00:49:30,169 --> 00:49:30,430
Rym: and people?

710
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:31,541
Scott: Your links is router?

711
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:32,349
Scott: does it on its own?

712
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,313
Scott: But it's it's.

713
00:49:33,534 --> 00:49:38,050
Scott: it's serving somebody with their hands had to make the IP addresses happen.

714
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:40,570
Rym: Now the thing is or you can just do it all yourself.

715
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:49,242
Rym: But there is a third way and this has been done in IP v4 And I'm not going to talk about all the different ways to do it But Microsoft actually did it better than most people.

716
00:49:49,262 --> 00:49:51,030
Scott: you ever heard of the other quickly.

717
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,876
Rym: But no it works better than most.

718
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:59,719
Rym: the auto configuration you ever noticed how if you don't get an address and you have a Microsoft Windows PC sometimes you'll get like an address.

719
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:00,883
Rym: That's all weird.

720
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:05,137
Rym: It's like 60 something dot something and basically what it does.

721
00:50:05,157 --> 00:50:07,087
Rym: and I'm simplifying obviously.

722
00:50:07,148 --> 00:50:22,539
Rym: but Windows computers if they're set up this way if they can't get an IP address, and they don't have one configured will pick in a certain range that Microsoft happens to own a random IP address paying the local network to see if anyone has that address.

723
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:25,187
Rym: and if no one does they'll take it for themselves.

724
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:30,830
Rym: and a bunch of Windows computer computers can kind of make their own ad hoc network.

725
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:33,970
Rym: Yeah on their own with very little if any interaction.

726
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,150
Scott: I mean it rare it's rarely useful.

727
00:50:36,692 --> 00:50:47,250
Scott: But on occasions if you just take a bunch of Windows PCs and you know plug them all into a switch Right they can sort of start networking and you know it is like a Windows for workgroups.

728
00:50:47,531 --> 00:50:49,501
Scott: You know sort of fallback kind of thing is there.

729
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:56,350
Scott: they can start connecting to each other They'll sort of come up with addresses on their own and some things will work that you can talk to each other.

730
00:50:56,772 --> 00:50:59,385
Rym: Now before we talk about how what you can do with ipv6.

731
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:00,390
Rym: that's cool with this.

732
00:51:00,953 --> 00:51:08,180
Rym: I want to talk about the fact that because there are so many IP addresses There was a lot of really interesting structure built into ipv4.

733
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,146
Rym: I mean there's the whole multicast group.

734
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,490
Rym: There's the experimental group.

735
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:19,469
Rym: There's all like the broadcast and all these kind of different things and hierarchies and kind of built in structure That is inherent in the design.

736
00:51:19,992 --> 00:51:24,748
Rym: But when you've got so much extra space with ipv6 you can you have a lot more room to work.

737
00:51:24,868 --> 00:51:25,390
Rym: as a result.

738
00:51:25,998 --> 00:51:40,150
Rym: you could Theoretically think of this what if you set aside in any given network a billion IP addresses just random ones and Any computer in that network can use some sort of semi random?

739
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:45,169
Rym: Seeding mechanism to pick an address in that scope if it doesn't have another way to get one?

740
00:51:46,132 --> 00:51:54,459
Rym: Odds are it will be a unique address and basically you can have DHCP without a DHCP server And there's so much leeway that it'll just work.

741
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:01,100
Rym: and you define you know ways to automatically find Routers and automatically say hey, I'm a new computer.

742
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,961
Rym: Are there any routers and routers in your local network can say hey I'm a router now.

743
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:06,750
Rym: I know you exist.

744
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:15,778
Scott: Let's play in other words because there's so many IP addresses and the odds of anyone picking the same one as someone else are Effectively zero because there's just so many.

745
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:22,258
Scott: you can just sort of have networks that configure themselves well Really without doing anything.

746
00:52:22,278 --> 00:52:23,524
Scott: you just plug computers in.

747
00:52:23,564 --> 00:52:24,730
Scott: boom they're working their network.

748
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:25,735
Scott: That's all good internet.

749
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,630
Scott: Go you don't have to fiddle with your network settings.

750
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:30,690
Scott: You know one has to set up the router.

751
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:34,445
Scott: You know someone has to set the router But they don't have to set it up as much as they would.

752
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:34,706
Scott: an ipv4.

753
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:42,329
Scott: You know there's a lot less tinkering and you're gonna have a lot less problems where all my you know networking is not working.

754
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:43,573
Scott: now It's not much gonna be.

755
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:44,857
Scott: are you plugged in?

756
00:52:45,238 --> 00:52:46,322
Scott: is your computer broken?

757
00:52:46,342 --> 00:52:47,947
Scott: and those things are yes?

758
00:52:49,257 --> 00:52:53,221
Scott: No Your computer is plugged in and it's not broken.

759
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:54,647
Scott: It's probably gonna just work with ipv6.

760
00:52:55,551 --> 00:53:01,490
Rym: Well, I mean the really interesting thing is that this idea like the root idea here is the future.

761
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:03,922
Rym: This is the future of everything right here right now.

762
00:53:04,323 --> 00:53:15,046
Rym: if you don't realize it this kind of non-deterministic Ad-hoc self configuration of multiple nodes is the future of all computing.

763
00:53:15,106 --> 00:53:16,170
Rym: This is the future of CPUs.

764
00:53:16,912 --> 00:53:18,137
Rym: This is the future of networks.

765
00:53:18,478 --> 00:53:19,923
Rym: This is the future of software.

766
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,810
Scott: Yeah, we're talking about things like right now, right?

767
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:27,230
Scott: Let's say me and Rym have cell phones, and we're sitting in public space right we want our cell phones to talk to each other.

768
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:33,790
Scott: Well, let's let's pretend that these are awesome open source cell phones with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and everything and the software is Linux.

769
00:53:33,912 --> 00:53:35,289
Scott: Okay, what do we have to do?

770
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:35,868
Scott: Well we can.

771
00:53:36,352 --> 00:53:37,517
Scott: You can do an infrared link.

772
00:53:37,557 --> 00:53:41,513
Scott: or one person has to say host and the other person has to say connect and we have to Aim them at each other.

773
00:53:41,613 --> 00:53:47,254
Scott: or you know someone has to say I'm making a Wi-Fi network and the other person says I'm joining your Wi-Fi network and the other.

774
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:54,605
Scott: or you could you know and then the guy who's hosting the Wi-Fi network has to run like a DTP server and tell the other guy an IP address and a whole thing.

775
00:53:54,926 --> 00:54:01,045
Scott: or if you're doing Bluetooth one guy has to be like Bluetooth discovery mode the other guy right with IPv6.

776
00:54:01,165 --> 00:54:03,629
Scott: if you pretty much just like hey What's up click?

777
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:06,560
Rym: IPv6 is not the thing that's going to cause that.

778
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:12,367
Rym: I'm talking more about the root concept because IPv6 Still has a lot of limitations, and you know there's limitations.

779
00:54:12,408 --> 00:54:17,050
Rym: that pretty much Is that IPv6 is not going to make any of these things happen.

780
00:54:18,051 --> 00:54:38,621
Rym: IPv6 is just a very rudimentary very kind of initial and very explorative exploratory Exploration of these sorts of concepts, but the future on a core to not talk about the technological underlying layer Non-deterministic ad hoc networking and communication is the future.

781
00:54:39,162 --> 00:54:42,050
Rym: and this non-deterministic is with this big space.

782
00:54:42,331 --> 00:54:45,600
Rym: IPv6 allows a very rudimentary form of this to happen.

783
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:47,485
Rym: I mean another example of this.

784
00:54:47,526 --> 00:54:48,950
Rym: I mean this is not a new idea.

785
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,635
Rym: Token ring was deterministic.

786
00:54:51,876 --> 00:54:53,581
Rym: you could calculate bandwidth perfectly.

787
00:54:53,721 --> 00:54:55,646
Rym: everything was controlled.

788
00:54:56,007 --> 00:54:57,712
Rym: every network device was Intelligent.

789
00:54:58,134 --> 00:55:00,803
Rym: every piece along the way was controlled deterministic.

790
00:55:01,024 --> 00:55:02,389
Rym: You know exactly what was happening.

791
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:08,066
Rym: Ethernet basically just shot its crap all out all over the internet and all just kind of worked out.

792
00:55:08,086 --> 00:55:32,284
Rym: if things ran into each other Everyone just said whoa backs off they wait a random amount of time before trying again and everything's kind of random and fuzzy and non-deterministic, but as Speeds got better and as you know technology got better these non-deterministic means always win out over the deterministic means of communication in the end and We're going to see a lot of cool things in these fronts in the future.

793
00:55:32,404 --> 00:55:36,135
Rym: IPv6 is one tiny Tiny tiny example of this.

794
00:55:36,216 --> 00:55:39,805
Scott: yeah, here's another another cool feature of IPv6 right?

795
00:55:39,905 --> 00:55:41,790
Scott: is the the multicast anycast?

796
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:42,272
Scott: Whatever.

797
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:46,488
Rym: yes, there is multicast and IPv4, but let me let me explain to you what this means.

798
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:54,269
Scott: all right IPv4 does have Multicast, but it doesn't really work super as you would want it to.

799
00:55:54,289 --> 00:56:01,389
Rym: well It's partly experimental and you can like I we use it for a lot of things at our job and IBM We used it and like Cisco uses it a lot.

800
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:06,994
Rym: But there are a lot of problems with IPv6 and it will with Multicast and IPv4.

801
00:56:07,175 --> 00:56:09,180
Rym: yeah, what IPv6 is done?

802
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,790
Rym: because you know before there was you know broadcast unicast multicast.

803
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:29,035
Rym: there is no such thing as broadcast in IPv6 because the idea of broadcast and broadcast domains and collision domains are Basically archaic nomenclatures that in modern networking Don't make sense.

804
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:30,458
Rym: so as a result they got rid of that.

805
00:56:30,919 --> 00:56:32,262
Rym: there is just multicast.

806
00:56:32,563 --> 00:56:48,282
Rym: multicast is defined multicast is universal Multicast is broken up into to not use all the jargon multicast to my local network multicast to all the routers on my network Multicast to my broad segment multicast to my geographical area.

807
00:56:48,743 --> 00:56:57,070
Rym: all these kinds of defined multicast Addresses or multicast networks that allow for really really interesting things.

808
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:04,917
Rym: Maybe not so much for you personally yet, but for large networks for configuration for organizations for backbones This is a killer app.

809
00:57:05,499 --> 00:57:07,105
Scott: Yeah, I mean think about it right now.

810
00:57:07,226 --> 00:57:08,290
Scott: You have a computer.

811
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:11,561
Scott: I want to send a video to Rym.

812
00:57:11,601 --> 00:57:14,190
Scott: so I have to say I open up a connection directly to Rym.

813
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:18,030
Scott: You know even though it's packetized It's not like a telephone network where it's a solid connection.

814
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,100
Scott: But I'm connected to Rym and I send him stuff.

815
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,199
Scott: You know to him only I want to send the video to Someone else at the same time.

816
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:26,942
Scott: well now.

817
00:57:26,982 --> 00:57:28,650
Scott: I have to use twice as much bandwidth.

818
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:33,685
Scott: I'm sending the same video two times over the same wire to two different people.

819
00:57:33,946 --> 00:57:39,550
Scott: if 20 people want the video I'm sending the same video 20 times over one wire.

820
00:57:39,871 --> 00:57:45,250
Scott: And this is why sites go down because they're you know the million people come and say give me give me give me give me.

821
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:49,383
Scott: And then their bandwidth fills up and the pipe that connects to their one computer, and then they're done.

822
00:57:50,486 --> 00:58:00,695
Scott: if we actually had multicast with ipv6 Which is a lot more useful than the ipv4 one in that you could actually do other things with it besides You know network management.

823
00:58:00,716 --> 00:58:03,809
Scott: It could actually be relied upon to do what you wanted to do.

824
00:58:04,755 --> 00:58:20,496
Scott: I could send out the video just once Over my wire and then he would go to the next router and the next router and it would only split up When there was actually people to split it up amongst you know it would go to one router and say all right everyone This is going to is still in that direction.

825
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:25,830
Scott: Okay, and it only takes up one space worth of itself until it gets somewhere.

826
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:30,050
Scott: Okay, some people who want to watch this video or to the left and some people want to watch it or to the right?

827
00:58:30,392 --> 00:58:33,457
Scott: So now we'll split it up But now it's only taking up to yet.

828
00:58:33,899 --> 00:58:41,849
Scott: at the other at the farthest end of the network there could be a hundred people Who want to watch that video, but we're only sending one copy of it over the network because it's a broadcast.

829
00:58:42,009 --> 00:58:43,134
Scott: now Make it there.

830
00:58:43,295 --> 00:58:45,504
Rym: It's not really gonna work like that in the real world.

831
00:58:45,544 --> 00:58:53,190
Rym: I mean basically it is Primarily going to be used within individual networks as opposed to on the global network.

832
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,334
Rym: I mean it's more for like the.

833
00:58:54,676 --> 00:59:21,569
Rym: the uses people like out there will have you will have is that if it's more Understood more well implemented and just works better, and there's more space to use it There'll be a lot of software like say you want to watch a movie on your like you want to stream your anime fans up Or whatever in your local dorm room or your house You'll just it'll automatically stream with this to all the devices that want to see it on your local network Without going on all the links that don't need it and all sorts of fun stuff like that.

834
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,410
Scott: Yeah, I mean think about for right now, right?

835
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:29,510
Scott: Let's say Rym wants to watch a video that's on my computer right and then I want to watch the same video downstairs.

836
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:36,885
Scott: So now my computer has to read this video and send it to two different computers and our network bandwidth in the house starts filling Up real quick and it gets slow.

837
00:59:36,925 --> 00:59:48,176
Scott: and Blair With if we had IPv6 and we had it set up properly with the new technologies It would be all good, and it would just send the video to both places But only send it once of course

838
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:51,730
Rym: only with specialized software and only if we're both watching at the same time.

839
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:54,949
Rym: Or we have some sort of very complex caching mechanism, but I digress.

840
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:59,010
Scott: I mean Yeah, I get into the specifics, but here's a really good example of how to make everything awesome.

841
00:59:59,372 --> 01:00:02,550
Scott: Let's say you want to play a game at a LAN party right?

842
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,786
Scott: Instead you know instead of having the.

843
01:00:06,048 --> 01:00:08,135
Scott: you know The game server right.

844
01:00:08,255 --> 01:00:16,070
Scott: send the game state updates to having to manage sending the state updates to each individual player It'll just broadcast the game state.

845
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:20,745
Rym: I'm well thing is you realize that most land like if you pick land instead of something else?

846
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:22,430
Rym: it does that anyway really?

847
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:25,522
Scott: I've never seen to do that unless you do the IPX BS.

848
01:00:26,044 --> 01:00:27,450
Rym: Well like steam and a lot of things do that.

849
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:34,884
Rym: I mean if you just play low like most games, and you just click pick land it'll broadcast a whole bunch of information around.

850
01:00:34,944 --> 01:00:35,969
Rym: every game does it differently.

851
01:00:35,989 --> 01:00:41,490
Rym: and The other caveat here is that most game publishers probably won't care because most people play online.

852
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,420
Rym: But you can do interesting stuff with this.

853
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:50,585
Rym: the real interesting thing about ipv6 The real interesting thing along these lines is something called anycast.

854
01:00:50,645 --> 01:00:51,869
Rym: now the idea here is that?

855
01:00:52,872 --> 01:01:11,830
Rym: You have an IP address or whatever a destination that exists wholly and completely in Multiple places and routers basically use the routing protocol updates They get from their neighbors to route your requests and its responses from the nearest node to you.

856
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:15,301
Rym: So say I I am valve and I have steam and I want to.

857
01:01:15,582 --> 01:01:17,809
Rym: I want to have you download software from me.

858
01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:28,562
Rym: I have multiple steam distribution servers in multiple geographical locations And if you connect to a steam server you connect to an anycast address.

859
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:31,510
Rym: that is just basically the steam download server.

860
01:01:32,152 --> 01:01:32,673
Rym: Routers.

861
01:01:32,894 --> 01:01:41,849
Rym: take your request to the nearest and nearest is a logical thing not a physical thing Server and you just get the updates from there, but it's all seamless to you.

862
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,404
Rym: You don't need to know or care.

863
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:51,030
Rym: in fact There is theoretically no way for the end-user to know that an address is an anycast address as opposed to a unicast address.

864
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:52,334
Scott: His isn't it right?

865
01:01:52,434 --> 01:01:57,047
Scott: right now things like this are actually happening, but they're doing it a very hackneyed way.

866
01:01:57,448 --> 01:01:59,175
Scott: for example Look at Google right.

867
01:01:59,657 --> 01:02:01,063
Scott: try to ping google.com.

868
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,610
Scott: It's gonna show up as an IP address.

869
01:02:03,232 --> 01:02:05,562
Scott: Alright, maybe if you ping Google from somewhere else.

870
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:07,690
Scott: You'll actually see it's a different IP address.

871
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:13,029
Scott: What's happening there is Google uses Akamai and I could talk about Akamai as a company that basically does this thing.

872
01:02:13,049 --> 01:02:17,290
Scott: and The way it works is you ask the DNS server?

873
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,741
Scott: Hey, what IP address is google.com?

874
01:02:20,143 --> 01:02:21,710
Scott: and depending on many factors?

875
01:02:22,212 --> 01:02:25,989
Scott: It'll tell you a different IP address to match up the name.

876
01:02:26,812 --> 01:02:34,758
Scott: What with ipv6 the difference is instead of asking for google.com and getting a different answer all the time You ask for google.com.

877
01:02:34,818 --> 01:02:37,070
Scott: if it's ipv6 you're always gonna get the same answer.

878
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:40,370
Scott: But and that number will be the same for everyone.

879
01:02:40,732 --> 01:02:48,361
Scott: but that number is actually just sort of a nickname or Alias for a bunch of other numbers that are where the servers really are.

880
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:51,149
Scott: and it decides on the routing layer a lower layer.

881
01:02:51,612 --> 01:02:52,708
Scott: It does this on its own.

882
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:56,802
Scott: Basically, the Akamai company will go out of business if ipv6 comes into play.

883
01:02:56,882 --> 01:02:59,069
Rym: No, they won't because you don't think so.

884
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:10,210
Rym: well, the thing is that the whole reason this is secure is the same reason the internet kind of works is that Large networks and like the top the higher tier providers peer with each other.

885
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:14,261
Rym: They trust each other and this happens at a low level protocol layer to where you.

886
01:03:14,722 --> 01:03:17,750
Rym: you trust the routes you get the route updates.

887
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:34,170
Rym: the you know routes are the things that tell packets where to go basically and you know you need to get your routing information from your neighbors and from other people out on the word on the world and they get their routing information from other people and You have to choose who to trust and you not to trust.

888
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:57,470
Rym: So for any cast to work the big-name players and the people who really matter on the internet have to trust the routes that are being propagated and any cast will Probably for a long time only really be available to very big players Which is for the best because otherwise it is the biggest freaking security hole in the world.

889
01:03:58,213 --> 01:04:12,367
Scott: Yeah, yeah, but I mean if we've solved all these problems on top of I know we have Only solved them because If we've solved other problems on top of IPv4 I'm sure we could solve you know, the problems in IPv6 just disease.

890
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:20,229
Rym: Oh, yeah What I'm saying is that things like anycast a lot of these cool functionality works because of the same reason the internet works.

891
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:31,109
Rym: now Very very large networks trust each other on a very specific Technological level and you do not have access to that trust and no one is going to trust you.

892
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,475
Scott: No, it's trusting you at all.

893
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:39,370
Rym: truck like trust on the internet is pretty much the most important commodity at a network level.

894
01:04:40,332 --> 01:04:47,161
Rym: Yeah, so a lot of the things you think you can do that are all cool You cannot do because no one will trust you except your friends.

895
01:04:48,063 --> 01:04:50,110
Scott: That's the simplest way you can do them with your friends.

896
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:51,590
Rym: Oh, yes, most definitely.

897
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:53,065
Scott: But in fact you can do with your friends.

898
01:04:53,146 --> 01:04:56,664
Scott: right now I pb6 is just your computer probably has everything it needs.

899
01:04:56,945 --> 01:04:57,889
Scott: You just need to set it up.

900
01:04:58,473 --> 01:05:03,760
Scott: You can set up a little LAN with IPv6 real easily Yes, but getting your IPv6 onto the real IPv6.

901
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,486
Rym: I'm not gonna get into this much more difficult.

902
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,506
Rym: Just google for IPv6 You'll find how-tos.

903
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:14,337
Rym: I mean I actually used to have a whole ton of addresses on the six bone back in the day because you know We went to RIT.

904
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:17,050
Rym: We're in access to internet too and all those sorts of fun things.

905
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:26,890
Rym: So I requested a ton of IPv6 addresses and my own IPv6 network on the six bone Because I was in a class where I had to do a big thesis on IPv6 and interoperability.

906
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:31,523
Rym: I dropped out of that class right away But I didn't give up my space and I played with it for a long time.

907
01:05:32,045 --> 01:05:34,939
Rym: that space is now gone But that's that's the end of that story.

908
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:37,510
Rym: Yeah, I didn't do anything cool with it.

909
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,239
Rym: I basically just played around and failed.

910
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:45,569
Scott: but basically I mean as for using IPv6 now and trans up and you know moving the internet over to it, right?

911
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,137
Scott: It's basically a huge pain right now.

912
01:05:48,237 --> 01:05:51,850
Scott: some things you can do are you can you know connect to other?

913
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:58,147
Scott: IPv6 enabled things out there across IPv6 networks, but they're not easy to find.

914
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:01,261
Scott: you sort of have to know It's more than your.

915
01:06:01,603 --> 01:06:08,266
Rym: you probably have IPv4 connectivity and IPv6 might be tunneled a lot of IVSPs.

916
01:06:08,286 --> 01:06:09,609
Rym: You're not gonna have direct IPv6.

917
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:13,590
Rym: Yeah, it really depends on who you are where you are what you're connected to.

918
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:16,990
Rym: Yeah, it's far out of the scope of this episode to talk about that.

919
01:06:17,171 --> 01:06:43,459
Rym: Suffice to say if you were at all interesting interested in networking and IP and IT and all these things if you try to learn how IPv6 works on a fundamental level and if you want to try to learn how to connect to it in The process of learning that you're going to learn a lot about networking and you're doing you're going to become Very competent on a theoretical level very quickly.

920
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:54,105
Rym: So look at IPv6 not as practical knowledge But as a kind of far-out goal that if you seek that goal You will learn a ton on the way kind of like installing Gen 2.

921
01:06:54,105 --> 01:07:01,950
Scott: Yeah I mean they're doing all sorts of weird things these days like they're putting IPv4 addresses inside of IPv6 addresses in there.

922
01:07:02,212 --> 01:07:03,421
Scott: You know, they're tunneling IPv6 over IPv4.

923
01:07:04,711 --> 01:07:10,669
Scott: So it's like well, I have an IPv6 network and you have an IPv6 network But there's only an IPv4 network between us.

924
01:07:11,151 --> 01:07:13,158
Scott: But we can make this little tunnel and sort of.

925
01:07:13,198 --> 01:07:23,680
Rym: now we sort of have an IPv6 network between us and because I mean For most consumers IPv6 is not going to actually matter to you for a long time And even then it's going to be completely transparent to you.

926
01:07:24,102 --> 01:07:25,729
Rym: You'll never really be affected by it.

927
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,790
Scott: Yes, but the reason is taking so long.

928
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:34,052
Scott: This is basically everyone has to switch all their stuff and no one's in a rush to do that because they don't need to Right now.

929
01:07:34,072 --> 01:07:39,032
Scott: this and there's no benefit that you will notice right away You'll you?

930
01:07:39,052 --> 01:07:44,456
Scott: basically if I had two networks set up with the same computers and one was six and one is four You couldn't tell a difference.

931
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:45,561
Scott: It's all.

932
01:07:45,922 --> 01:07:47,770
Scott: the difference is all where you can't see it.

933
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:54,230
Scott: It's completely invisible to you as a user but much like Xavocom the possibilities are endless and less possible.

934
01:07:54,472 --> 01:07:56,628
Scott: billions and billions of possibilities per square inch.

935
01:08:03,153 --> 01:08:05,742
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

936
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:07,890
