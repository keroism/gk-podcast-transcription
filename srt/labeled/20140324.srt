1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,617
Rym: It's Monday, March 24th, 2014.

2
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:09,899
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,190
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,855
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:19,410
Rym: We're back from Anime Boston and we're talking about internet services that are dead.

6
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:21,467
Rym: What to do about it.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,188
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,430
Rym: So a while ago, a beep started happening in my apartment.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,810
Scott: Oh, wasn't it the Fios thing?

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:47,250
Rym: It was the Fios thing, but for a while, you know, Scott pointed out that I opined at length on multiple GeekNights episodes in the past that the best way to annoy someone is to make a device that intermittently beeps and is self-powered and hide it in their apartment.

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,622
Scott: It's called the Neutron.

12
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:49,329
Scott: ThinkGeek sells it.

13
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,051
Scott: Exactly.

14
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:57,850
Rym: So I investigated and pretty quickly discovered that my Fios had, it has a backup battery and that battery had died.

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,230
Rym: Yeah, so here's where it gets complicated.

16
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:05,569
Rym: So I silenced the alarm because I didn't give a fuck and I deal with it later.

17
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:08,690
Scott: I've heard it go off, though, recently.

18
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:09,552
Rym: Yes.

19
00:01:09,772 --> 00:01:17,109
Rym: What I confirmed is that everyone else's Fios batteries in this building appear to also be dead.

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,986
Rym: So it's beeping in other apartments as well and none of those people probably notice it.

21
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:25,450
Rym: That's my guess.

22
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,350
Rym: So I googled around a little bit online and a lot of people are having this problem.

23
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:38,570
Rym: Both that their neighbors don't know and aren't replacing the battery or they try to get the battery replaced.

24
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,212
Rym: And guess what?

25
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:40,921
Rym: Verizon won't replace it.

26
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,630
Rym: You have to pay money and buy your own battery.

27
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:43,648
Scott: Okay.

28
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,025
Rym: That's hidden in the Fios terms of service.

29
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:48,650
Rym: So if you have Verizon Fios- Shouldn't you just recharge that shit?

30
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:50,440
Rym: Yes, but it's like a UPS.

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,030
Rym: Eventually those batteries stop working.

32
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,070
Scott: It's only been there not that long.

33
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:56,110
Rym: Since 2009.

34
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,969
Scott: It's not that long.

35
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,128
Rym: UPS batteries are usually warrantied for one year.

36
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:02,983
Scott: It's awful.

37
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,630
Rym: So I have to buy a battery, but I'll do that later.

38
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,734
Rym: So it worked today.

39
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:11,230
Rym: We're in a conference room and I wasn't in on Friday because- And you heard it.

40
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,594
Rym: I heard that dude.

41
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,160
Rym: No one noticed it.

42
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:16,390
Rym: So I just waited all day.

43
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:17,981
Rym: It happens every now and then.

44
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:18,849
Rym: No one notices it.

45
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,206
Rym: So finally I asked everyone, "Did anyone else hear that beeping noise?

46
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,149
Rym: Nobody.".

47
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:25,068
Scott: They probably had bad hearing.

48
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,033
Rym: Yeah.

49
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:28,368
Rym: I'm convinced that nobody has good hearing except me.

50
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:29,266
Scott: Maybe you.

51
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:31,324
Scott: We're the only people who can hear the TVs.

52
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:31,546
Scott: They go,

53
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:31,667
Scott: "Deee.".

54
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,415
Rym: I remember that experiment.

55
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:36,787
Rym: We did the single blind test of, "Can you hear the

56
00:02:36,827 --> 00:02:36,988
Rym: TV?".

57
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,184
Rym: That old TV, the 74 color RCA.

58
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,690
Rym: And I recall that both of us could hear it outside with the door closed.

59
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:43,831
Scott: Right.

60
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:46,002
Scott: It's like we went outside the room and we said, "All right.

61
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,530
Scott: You don't tell us if it's on or off.

62
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:49,329
Scott: We'll tell you if it's on or

63
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:49,410
Scott: off.".

64
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,158
Rym: And we're like, "It's on.

65
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:50,745
Scott: It's

66
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:50,988
Scott: off.".

67
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,322
Scott: They turned it on and we said, "It's

68
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:52,483
Scott: on.".

69
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:54,041
Scott: And it turned off and we said, "It's

70
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:54,224
Scott: off.".

71
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:57,270
Scott: And it was up to them to decide whether it was on or off.

72
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,257
Scott: And you know this works.

73
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,410
Scott: This is a good test to do because those people who say they get Wi-Fi sickness do the same thing.

74
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,855
Scott: Say, "All right.

75
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:08,569
Scott: Go in the other room where you can't see and I'm going to turn the router on and off and you tell me whether it's making you sick or

76
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:08,790
Scott: not.".

77
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:12,769
Scott: And they won't be able to tell you the moment you turn it on.

78
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,633
Rym: Even better.

79
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:16,570
Rym: If you tell them you turned it on, they'll start faking all the symptoms.

80
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:18,974
Rym: So, yeah.

81
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,409
Rym: If you have Fios, go check and see if...

82
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:25,590
Scott: Actually, this will be the same with pretty much any sort of fiber service.

83
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,050
Scott: I just don't know if other services besides Fios might just replace your battery and not be assholes.

84
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:32,929
Rym: I don't think anyone else will replace the battery either.

85
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,230
Scott: You know what else you could do, right?

86
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,370
Scott: Is you could just go buy a bunch of the batteries and go around the building selling to the people for a lot of money.

87
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,800
Rym: I could put on overalls and put a name tag on.

88
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,009
Rym: that doesn't actually say I'm from Verizon's Fios.

89
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:44,922
Scott: It says "Verosen

90
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:45,065
Scott: Hoose.".

91
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:48,766
Rym: No, it says "I'm a fan of Verizon

92
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:49,269
Rym: Fios.".

93
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:50,769
Rym: That's free speech.

94
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,174
Scott: Sure.

95
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:54,045
Scott: Just trademark infringement.

96
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:54,990
Scott: if you got their logo, though.

97
00:03:55,331 --> 00:04:01,330
Rym: Yeah, if I use it for purposes of defrauding and to... Because you can use a logo for fair use in certain cases, too.

98
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,270
Scott: But the thing is, you actually wouldn't be defrauding people.

99
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,589
Scott: You would just be selling them the legitimate battery for a legitimate problem that they do have.

100
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,669
Scott: For a reasonable price.

101
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,510
Scott: You're just selling it for an overcharge, which every store does.

102
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:16,820
Scott: That's what stores do.

103
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,110
Scott: You're basically being a store.

104
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,230
Scott: So what's illegal about that?

105
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,069
Rym: Yeah, door-to-door salesmen's coming back.

106
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,806
Rym: So kids, if you have Fios, go check and see if a big red light is on.

107
00:04:25,846 --> 00:04:26,589
Rym: that says "Replace

108
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,970
Rym: Battery."

109
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,030
Rym: If it is, and you didn't know that until now, your hearing sucks.

110
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:33,699
Scott: Yeah.

111
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:34,970
Scott: You should go get a hearing test.

112
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,250
Scott: I mean, just in general.

113
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:40,510
Scott: People go get eye tests even if they don't have eye problems, right?

114
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,949
Rym: Yeah, because you might not know you have glaucoma.

115
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:43,910
Rym: Like, for real.

116
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:52,070
Scott: Yeah, I was talking actually with the chair of Kinetico at Anime Boston, because his wife told him to go to the eye doctor, even though his eyes are awesome, like mine.

117
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,510
Scott: And it's just like, yeah, but who gets a hearing test?

118
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,799
Scott: Even if you go to get physicals, like when you're a kid and you go to physicals, they always give you the hearing test.

119
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:00,987
Scott: Like, which ear did you hear that in?

120
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:01,310
Scott: and shit?

121
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:09,310
Scott: But adults tend not to get hearing tests, and you should probably get one at least once in a while, every few years or something.

122
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:17,170
Rym: What I don't understand really is why my hearing is still so great, because I've abused my ears quite a bit over the years.

123
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:20,870
Scott: I've abused them moderately, but it's like going in the subway, that sort of thing.

124
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,250
Rym: Well, you realize now, since we moved into the city, I wear my etymotics when I'm in the subway.

125
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:26,948
Rym: Every day.

126
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,728
Scott: Etymotics help.

127
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,668
Scott: Yeah, but seriously.

128
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,150
Scott: I think other people, it's like we abuse our ears somewhat.

129
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,730
Scott: We go to a concert once in a while, we listen to a lot of music once in a while, right?

130
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:44,090
Scott: But the other people are like, the people who have bad hearing problems are really, who don't have it for some other reason, right?

131
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,429
Scott: The people who physically damage their ears with loud noise.

132
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,710
Scott: They are doing way, way worse than we are.

133
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,050
Scott: It's like we're doing it in moderation.

134
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,455
Rym: You know what?

135
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:52,248
Rym: It might be genetic.

136
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:54,989
Rym: It might be like the thing where if you make it to...

137
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,493
Scott: Yes, I am.

138
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,730
Scott: We already know I'm genetically superior to everybody.

139
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,828
Scott: We don't need to remind everyone of that.

140
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,270
Rym: With your double veins.

141
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,066
Scott: That's right.

142
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:02,957
Rym: Your double veins.

143
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:04,130
Rym: Scott's double veins, everybody.

144
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,336
Scott: I got two sets of veins.

145
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:08,169
Scott: in case I get, I won't get a heart attack, the other ones.

146
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:16,405
Rym: But our friend Pete, he went to get hearing testing and they were like, "Yeah, you have hearing loss in all these

147
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:16,729
Rym: areas.".

148
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,350
Scott: He knew he was almost deaf in one ear.

149
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,530
Rym: Yes, but you know what happened?

150
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,350
Rym: They gave him a hearing aid and you know what?

151
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,449
Scott: It's an awesome hearing aid.

152
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:24,150
Rym: It transformed his life.

153
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:25,769
Scott: It's got Bluetooth and shit.

154
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,406
Rym: So in general, my advice to you...

155
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,350
Scott: And he can also turn people off.

156
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,021
Scott: He'll be like, "Oh, I feel like being deaf again.

157
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:30,767
Scott: I don't have to hear your

158
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:31,109
Scott: yapping.".

159
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:37,350
Rym: If you're a nerd, you should try to augment your senses if you can.

160
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,190
Rym: If you have kind of okay vision, why not have perfect vision?

161
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:45,370
Rym: If you have kind of okay hearing, why not have perfect hearing?

162
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,690
Scott: If you're poor and Obama didn't help you with his Obamacare.

163
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:49,570
Rym: Yeah.

164
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:54,270
Rym: Well, so at least know that you have a bad hearing and bad vision.

165
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,670
Scott: Buy some bootleg hearing aids from China.

166
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,330
Rym: Move to Europe where they have universal healthcare.

167
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,149
Scott: Something like that.

168
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:00,318
Scott: Yeah.

169
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,068
Scott: All right.

170
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:03,248
Scott: So, news is.

171
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:11,970
Scott: So, you know, up until now, I mean, you know, it's not a secret that we are anti-smoking and such.

172
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:16,549
Rym: Now, again, just to be very clear, I don't care that it's bad for you.

173
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:20,390
Rym: I only care that you smell like a dead rat.

174
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:22,829
Scott: I also care that it's bad for me if you smoke near me.

175
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,390
Rym: But bad for me does not bother me as much as smells bad.

176
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:27,989
Scott: Both of those bother me.

177
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:32,930
Scott: But it's like if you were just hurting yourself and not hurting me, I wouldn't give any fucks.

178
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,749
Scott: Look at all the zero fucks I give.

179
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:35,647
Scott: Right?

180
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,990
Scott: Which is why until today.

181
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,190
Rym: Never divide by the number of fucks I have given.

182
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,230
Scott: Until today, I was super like, yeah, e-cigarettes, awesome.

183
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:46,570
Scott: Because that means someone can, if they want to be stupid and poison themselves.

184
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,770
Rym: I know what your news is.

185
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,650
Scott: They can poison themselves and they won't be poisoning me.

186
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,949
Scott: They're just spraying water vapor around, no problem.

187
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,429
Scott: Well, it turns out there are two newses here.

188
00:07:56,872 --> 00:07:59,490
Scott: News number one, not really a bad news.

189
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:14,830
Scott: News number one is simply that there have been quite a few cases, over 1300 cases in 2013, which is an increase of 300% of people who just took e-cigarette chemical and drank it or some shit.

190
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,390
Scott: And crazy poisoned themselves.

191
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:17,963
Rym: Yeah.

192
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,590
Scott: Because that shit is basically almost pure nicotine.

193
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,689
Rym: You know what I blame this on?

194
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:29,090
Rym: The people who use drugs, like perhaps marijuana, they know a lot about their hobby usually.

195
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:34,150
Rym: So they understand about concentrates and hash oils and resins and whatever.

196
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:44,150
Rym: But guys who smoke cigarettes already don't really have a good grasp of causality and already don't really recognize that nicotine is a straight up poison.

197
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,825
Scott: Right, there's only been one death since 2011 because of this.

198
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:50,770
Scott: Someone who killed themselves by injecting it on purpose.

199
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,728
Rym: Injecting it?

200
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,110
Scott: Right, but there have been a lot of people.

201
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:02,850
Scott: For example, one person, according to this article, had some of it spilled on them and it absorbed through their skin and they had had cardiac problems immediately pretty much.

202
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,648
Rym: I can believe that.

203
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,969
Scott: They didn't die though, but that's not good.

204
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,650
Rym: I've also read a lot of stories about people basically ODing just because they don't know how to set the dosages, they don't read the manual.

205
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,430
Scott: Sure, I mean this stuff doesn't really bother me so much.

206
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,110
Scott: I mean like Drano, which Rym just bought, is super dangerous.

207
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:23,550
Scott: But I guess it's not that dangerous that you pour it on your hand and you have cardiac problems, you just burn your hand.

208
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,656
Rym: Yeah, really badly.

209
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:26,590
Rym: I'm afraid of Drano, don't get me wrong.

210
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,990
Scott: People have always been getting hurt by dangerous chemicals in the home.

211
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,909
Scott: We already know how to deal with that.

212
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,390
Scott: Perhaps they have shaken hands with danger.

213
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:40,110
Scott: I don't think we need to regulate dangerous chemicals in the home, especially when they're useful chemicals that are legal and whatever.

214
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:44,010
Scott: But here's another article and this is serious biz.

215
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,470
Scott: So apparently, basically there weren't a lot of studies done in these e-cigarettes.

216
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,976
Scott: People just sort of trusted, and I guess myself included, were stupid enough to trust that.

217
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:56,870
Scott: yeah, it's just water vapor coming out of there.

218
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:08,470
Scott: It's just a heating element and then water and it burns all the chemicals and shit and all of it goes out one way and then the steam water vapor comes out the other end.

219
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,930
Rym: Well it doesn't burn, it evaporates into a mist or you can then inhale, hopefully to absorb in your lungs.

220
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,030
Scott: Sure, but it turns out that actually it's not just water vapor coming out the other end.

221
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,790
Scott: There is mad amounts of heavy metals and other nasty stuff that comes out the other end.

222
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,869
Scott: Nicotine comes out the other end also.

223
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,734
Rym: Yeah, so you know what?

224
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:32,750
Rym: Fuck you guys, we're banning them in the same level that we ban cigarettes.

225
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,790
Scott: Yeah, up until today I was like e-cigarettes all good.

226
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:49,949
Scott: Unless you can prove to me that you have developed an e-cigarette to where truly only water vapor is coming out the other end and only poison goes out your end than as we had assumed it was until now.

227
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,429
Scott: Well these guys found out, poison's coming out both ends, so fuck you.

228
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,529
Scott: You can't go poisoning people who happen to be here.

229
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,990
Rym: If you whip that shit out at a convention, you're a dickbag and we're going to kick you out.

230
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,210
Scott: Yeah, I mean like it's weird, like last year if someone whipped it out at a convention, I'd be like all good.

231
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,590
Scott: So if someone whips it out at a convention I'm at tomorrow, I'm going to say something.

232
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:09,570
Scott: And if I'm staff, I'm going to do something.

233
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:09,908
Scott: Yup.

234
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:12,089
Scott: And I'll bring out this article on you.

235
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,150
Rym: Now, I still think everyone who does this sort of thing- It's stupid, it's just as stupid as someone who smokes.

236
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,033
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

237
00:11:19,435 --> 00:11:20,017
Rym: Go nuts.

238
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:22,730
Rym: I'd rather you do this because at least you won't smell bad.

239
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,475
Scott: Sure, oh yeah, okay.

240
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:29,450
Scott: If you're going to smoke, like the choices are do this or smoke actual cigarettes.

241
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,085
Scott: Yes, this is still a better choice for you to do.

242
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,844
Rym: But no, if you're going to smoke something, smoke marijuana.

243
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:36,810
Rym: Jesus Christ kids.

244
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:39,528
Scott: That's still, I mean, you're still poisoning people.

245
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:41,488
Rym: Well, it depends, yeah.

246
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,489
Scott: If you're going to, ideally, don't smoke shit.

247
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,700
Rym: Yeah, vaporize it.

248
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:49,690
Rym: Brownies.

249
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,401
Scott: Brownies is actually probably overall the best way.

250
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:57,110
Scott: You are truly only poisoning yourself.

251
00:11:57,811 --> 00:12:01,510
Scott: And you cannot possibly do anything to anyone else near you in any way.

252
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:08,710
Rym: You know, there have been a couple of cases of people who have been aerosolizing Vodak and inhaling that.

253
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,890
Scott: Well, I mean, there's oxygen bars too, right?

254
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:18,330
Scott: But it's not like you're, if you're spraying that shit all over the rooms, like you walk in the room and you get wasted, that's a problem.

255
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:24,810
Scott: But if like, you've got a little thing where you put it over your face and you push a button and it goes- I just imagine people in Russia like vodka hotboxing.

256
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,551
Scott: Right.

257
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:30,490
Scott: If you just put a thing over your face and press a button and it goes, and vodka comes out.

258
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:38,210
Scott: It's like, well, you can't get anyone else drunk with that unless you put it over their face and what you shouldn't be doing because it's basically just assaulting someone.

259
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,039
Rym: So I got kind of a, this is an opinion.

260
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:42,646
Rym: Twitter turned eight.

261
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:43,550
Rym: It's eight years old now.

262
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,279
Rym: A lot of articles about, oh my God, Twitter's eight.

263
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,003
Rym: And there's a lot of articles.

264
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:51,330
Rym: Yeah, I feel extra old now.

265
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:58,730
Rym: But there's a rumor going around that they're going to remove or minimize the @signs and hashtags.

266
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:00,528
Scott: How could you possibly do that?

267
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:00,690
Rym: What?

268
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:10,650
Rym: By having the clients basically either auto can like auto do it to where once you type at to type in someone's name, you'll never see the @sign in the response.

269
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,990
Scott: Oh, it'll just be like in the metadata?

270
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,590
Rym: You'll just see, yeah, you'll just see a highlighted name.

271
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:15,393
Scott: Oh, that's cool.

272
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:19,430
Scott: That's basically what Google plus does is like you send things to, and it's all metadata.

273
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,364
Scott: You don't actually lose space in your tweet or your Google plus message.

274
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:24,990
Scott: Not that those have limited space, right?

275
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:29,482
Scott: But it's just who it's to and who it's from is all side metadata.

276
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,648
Scott: And you can now get your full 140 characters worth.

277
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,390
Scott: I'm in favor of that.

278
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:46,530
Rym: But at the same time, uh, I'm conflicted for one reason, because I've seen other services and other things, programming languages, scripting, lots of things where you have some sort of syntax and like HTML.

279
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,239
Rym: A lot of people to this day don't know HTML.

280
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,510
Rym: It's basically hidden from people who don't like go looking for it anymore.

281
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:55,770
Rym: As a result, a lot of people in forums can't fucking type anything.

282
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:11,230
Rym: But my issue is just that if you remove them from the client view and just replace it with hyperlinks, it sort of, I don't want to say dumps down the interface or dumps down the experience, because it's not at that level.

283
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,074
Rym: It's like one step above dumbing down.

284
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:26,550
Rym: Like it removes a little bit of context and it sort of removes that trigger for people who are young or people who don't use the technology a lot that, hey, maybe this tool is more powerful than I realize it is.

285
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:32,230
Rym: It removes a little bit of the explicit prescriptive nature of this language.

286
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,740
Scott: If I write a tweet that says, hey, @shazar, what's up?

287
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,086
Scott: Now that tweet is going to basically be rewritten instead of just saying, hey, what's up?

288
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:44,910
Scott: And there's an @shazar sort of attached to it somewhere?

289
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:46,664
Rym: That is likely what they're going to do.

290
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:47,369
Rym: This is all rumors.

291
00:14:47,430 --> 00:15:01,570
Scott: I mean, what if I'm like, you know, shazar and, you know, went to the store today and now everyone who's following me is just going to see went to the store today and then the metadata will be like @shazar and that actually changes what I said.

292
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:03,153
Scott: So that's a problem, right?

293
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:03,954
Scott: You got to leave.

294
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:05,117
Scott: It's okay.

295
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,441
Scott: You just have to leave the name in the tweet, right?

296
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:09,665
Scott: And you can save me those characters.

297
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:12,070
Scott: That's cool, because then I can type more, right?

298
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:18,070
Scott: But you still have to leave that in there and you can put it in the metadata too, you know.

299
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:18,531
Rym: Here's the thing.

300
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:28,350
Rym: If you do it the way Facebook does it, where like I got a graphic here, that's what Facebook does, where once you type it, it replaces it with this like iconic link to the person's name.

301
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:29,061
Scott: Yeah, that's fine.

302
00:15:29,264 --> 00:15:29,610
Scott: That's cool.

303
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:45,368
Rym: But there's an argument to be made, I'm not really making it strongly because I don't have a strong opinion on this, that by removing the @ sign from all the published tweets, the average non-tech dumb user will forget how to or not realize they can.

304
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,750
Rym: Like they won't know how implicitly to include someone else's name except via some sort of GUI.

305
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,035
Scott: Well, Facebook, you don't even need to type the @.

306
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:57,862
Scott: You can just start typing someone's name and it's all good.

307
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:59,185
Scott: So it's like, okay, good.

308
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,230
Scott: Why should we have to type the @?

309
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,754
Scott: Now I can use the @ symbol to.

310
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:09,390
Scott: actually, there are a lot of times in Twitter I want to use the @ symbol to be an @ symbol and I can't because it's all trying to be an @ symbol.

311
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:15,390
Rym: Yeah, but if that's based on names, in Twitter, people's handles are usually something far different from their name.

312
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:15,874
Scott: Right, like.

313
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,230
Scott: what if I start on Twitter?

314
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:18,087
Rym: I type S.

315
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:21,400
Scott: Right, no, what if someone's Twitter handle is like fruit?

316
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,105
Scott: and I'm like, man, ate some good fruit today.

317
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,610
Scott: It'll be like @fruit.

318
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:28,940
Rym: Or what if it starts auto-completing?

319
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:31,890
Rym: because the only reason I can use @ is that it auto-completes.

320
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,270
Scott: I'm sure Twitter engineers are not going to fuck it up and they have thought of these problems.

321
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:36,834
Rym: Oh, I know.

322
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,770
Rym: I'm just saying that in general, there's a...

323
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:46,790
Scott: I think this is a case of, you're almost leaning towards being one of, you're trying, you know that if you go farther with this, you're being like that guy who's like, Twitter redesign.

324
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:49,068
Scott: It's like, yeah, shit changes, deal with it.

325
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:49,270
Scott: Who cares?

326
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:49,935
Rym: Oh, no, I don't care.

327
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:50,560
Rym: It doesn't affect me.

328
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:51,588
Rym: I wonder...

329
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,035
Scott: That's definitely going to happen though.

330
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,726
Scott: As soon as they change it, that guy is going to come out again.

331
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,382
Scott: He's going to be like, they changed it.

332
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,427
Scott: Change is bad.

333
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:01,030
Scott: Can't have any change.

334
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,010
Rym: Can't use Office 9 to 8 because it's different from Office 9 to 7.

335
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,218
Scott: Yeah, that guy, eat a dick, that guy.

336
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:10,150
Scott: I hope they do this just so that guy will get enraged again.

337
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:12,061
Scott: Just to troll that guy.

338
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:12,888
Scott: I want this to happen.

339
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:25,190
Rym: But whenever you do design, just think about, there's a fine line between streamlining an interface and hiding useful complexity or useful declarative means of communicating.

340
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,659
Rym: The add sign is a very definite declarative prescriptive.

341
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,947
Rym: It says very clearly, this is syntax that has meaning.

342
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,370
Rym: It's a reserved syntax.

343
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:42,687
Rym: By removing that from the outward view, for example, if I want to autocomplete, how does it know?

344
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:43,830
Rym: I start typing someone's name?

345
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,430
Rym: Do I type at so that it knows to autocomplete?

346
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,793
Scott: Facebook solved this problem.

347
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:54,309
Scott: It's just really fucking smart because they have a zillion developers and nothing you could ever program, but they got it.

348
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:54,750
Scott: Done.

349
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,150
Rym: But at the same time, Facebook names are...

350
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,729
Scott: Just because you don't understand how they do it.

351
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,110
Rym: But I'm saying Facebook names are first name, last name.

352
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:01,630
Scott: It doesn't matter.

353
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:02,949
Rym: It does a little bit.

354
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:04,178
Scott: You haven't used Facebook.

355
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,205
Scott: It just fucking works.

356
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:05,850
Scott: It knows.

357
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:06,411
Rym: Yeah.

358
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:09,030
Rym: I wonder if it'll just work the same way on Twitter.

359
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:16,190
Scott: I'm sure the Twitter engineers, who also is another company with a ton of really smart people working at it, will be able to develop equivalent technologies.

360
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:16,713
Scott: Well, here's the thing.

361
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:19,570
Rym: What's interesting is that all this discussion is based on our rumor.

362
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:21,410
Scott: Oh, well then, who gives a shit?

363
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:29,597
Rym: So, things of the day.

364
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:30,600
Rym: We're at Anime Boston.

365
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,610
Rym: Our good friend Mike Tool stepped up his technology game.

366
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:38,149
Rym: So, he presented his usual anime hell, and just to give you guys...

367
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,222
Scott: Took a little trip to hell.

368
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:39,829
Scott: Two hours.

369
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:41,669
Rym: A kippu to jikoku.

370
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:50,830
Rym: So, for those of you who aren't animes, anime hell is something special, so I want to share with you just a little piece of hell.

371
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,635
Rym: We can share this hell together.

372
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:56,410
Rym: This is Shake Hands with Danger.

373
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,950
Scott: And then end up in hell.

374
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,950
Rym: It is actually the remix of Shake Hands with Danger.

375
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,210
Scott: Which is why it's worth watching.

376
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:06,570
Rym: So, I will link to you, just for reference, the original Shake Hands with Danger.

377
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:11,210
Rym: And just enjoy it for what it is, and let us never speak of this again.

378
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:18,970
Rym: If you ever come to an anime con, and you want to find us, if you see an anime hell, we'll probably be there in the front room, half asleep.

379
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:24,530
Scott: So, the show, we're going to talk about what to do when cloud shit goes down.

380
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,690
Scott: But sometimes, local shit goes down.

381
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,721
Scott: And, you know, we always talk about backups.

382
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:31,430
Scott: Yeah, have backups of your shit.

383
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,030
Scott: But sometimes, right, you can't have a backup.

384
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,410
Scott: For example, the most common case is you got an SD card in your camera.

385
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:44,870
Scott: It's very rare that you have a camera that will take a picture and save that same picture to two SD cards simultaneously.

386
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,810
Rym: Now, you might have the workflow of every time I get home, I dump everything from my SD card into my stand.

387
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:55,950
Scott: Sure, but only professionals will have, like, they'll take the HDMI output of the camera to, like, multiple recorders and shit.

388
00:19:56,292 --> 00:20:00,069
Scott: Or like us, with our mixer, recording to the Marantz, which isn't on right now.

389
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,130
Rym: Yeah, I think I ran out the battery at, uh, Anime Boston.

390
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:09,310
Scott: And also, the computer, we're not doing it right now, but usually, GeekNights is recorded to two places at the same time, right?

391
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,390
Rym: Yes, but also Audition has really good backup capabilities.

392
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,070
Scott: Right, but what if you take photos in your camera or make a video, and the SD card in there dies?

393
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:18,446
Rym: In the time, between.

394
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,510
Scott: And even if you're super good about backups, you're just fucked right there, right?

395
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,490
Scott: There's nothing you could have done about that without being super pro equipment.

396
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:26,902
Rym: Yup.

397
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,350
Scott: So, what do you do in this situation?

398
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:38,609
Scott: Well, here is a, someone posted a thing on Reddit titled, "How I lost over 100 pics to a corrupted SD card, but was able to recover most of

399
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:38,810
Scott: them.".

400
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:48,370
Scott: And the method he describes is not too bad, but in the comments, there's tons and tons of other people talking about all different ways to get you out of this situation.

401
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:52,070
Scott: All kinds of different softwares you can get and use and other techniques.

402
00:20:52,230 --> 00:21:08,970
Scott: So, this is a real problem that you can have, and a case in which even someone following best practices will need to do some sort of data recovery, and this is going to be super useful to you at least one point in your life, so save it in your delicious or your somewhere until that day that will inevitably come.

403
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,610
Rym: Now, you gotta be careful, because undeleted data can often lead to a cleaning.

404
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,028
Scott: That is true.

405
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:20,270
Rym: Speaking of which, the book of the book is wool, with a capital W, like the stuff that comes off of the animal.

406
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,147
Scott: The sheeps.

407
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:21,774
Scott: Yup.

408
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:22,888
Rym: The sweaters.

409
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,130
Rym: I'm pretty far through with that.

410
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,310
Scott: The wool over your eyes, which is what the book is talking about.

411
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,049
Rym: But also the wool used to perform the cleanings.

412
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,370
Rym: The cleanings that are part of the wool.

413
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,389
Scott: I think that's steel wool.

414
00:21:34,153 --> 00:21:35,189
Rym: Uh, yeah, it's still wool.

415
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:35,605
Rym: Maybe.

416
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:37,189
Rym: You said steel wool!

417
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:40,410
Rym: You're gonna tell me that the metaphor does not extend that far.

418
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,189
Scott: The steel wool actually have even one piece of sheep in it.

419
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:46,470
Scott: That's all I'm saying.

420
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:52,590
Rym: Yeah, that book is exactly what Scott's bells went off, and I got the same bells.

421
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,629
Rym: We'll talk about it when we do the book club book, if you're not reading that book.

422
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:04,590
Rym: The book club has a ton of other books we talked about, including the two official books of GeekNights, The Prince of Nothing and Player of Games.

423
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,329
Rym: I think few books will unseat those two.

424
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,469
Scott: Probably not.

425
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:09,690
Scott: Other meta things.

426
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,069
Scott: Anime boosting is over.

427
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:12,290
Rym: Yes, we done.

428
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:13,910
Scott: We done, until next year.

429
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:17,608
Scott: So, we're gonna maybe upload a video or other stuff?

430
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:20,230
Rym: I don't want to waste time on this.

431
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,190
Rym: We'll talk about it tomorrow, you know, the Animu Day.

432
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:30,250
Rym: But Anime Boston has some ridiculous security theater that made it such a pain in the ass that we didn't video most of our panels.

433
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:40,050
Rym: Because the city of Boston is full of scared, horrible people, or at least the people in charge of the group that makes the decisions like this are scared and horrible people.

434
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:45,450
Rym: So, we had to get searched and/or metal detector pat-downs just to go into and out of the con.

435
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:53,850
Rym: So, we tried to be in the con as little as possible and bring as few electronic pieces of equipment for them to manhandle as possible.

436
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,029
Rym: Some cool listeners got some video of us.

437
00:22:57,456 --> 00:22:57,788
Scott: One guy.

438
00:22:58,353 --> 00:22:59,323
Scott: I don't even know if he's a listener.

439
00:22:59,343 --> 00:22:59,969
Scott: I think he's just a guy.

440
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,990
Rym: And I got video of a panel because it wasn't actually in the convention center.

441
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,930
Scott: He also got video of that panel, so we can combine his video with our video to make a two angle video.

442
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:09,800
Rym: Yup, so we'll see.

443
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,589
Rym: I'll get around to that.

444
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,510
Rym: But unless that policy changes, we're never videoing stuff at Anime Boston again.

445
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,770
Rym: So, you gotta see us live if you wanna see our anime panels.

446
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,070
Scott: At least at Anime Boston.

447
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,750
Rym: Yeah, what other anime con should we go to?

448
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:22,688
Scott: Other conventions are coming up.

449
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,289
Scott: Zenkai Con.

450
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:24,992
Scott: Well, hold on.

451
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:28,950
Scott: Not this weekend, but the weekend after that is the Mocha Fest in New York City.

452
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:29,650
Rym: We'll be there.

453
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,596
Scott: We'll go there as usual.

454
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:32,570
Scott: Just like a one day in and out deal, as always.

455
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:39,190
Rym: So, as a side note, it's interesting that none of the people we know who usually are at these things are gonna have tables.

456
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,597
Scott: Mocha is having some drama.

457
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:42,870
Scott: Who knows how long that will go, but it's been a good ride.

458
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,864
Scott: We've been going to that shit since like '06, '07.

459
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,429
Rym: Yeah, back in the Puck building, but might be trouble this year.

460
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,689
Scott: Who knows.

461
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:56,110
Scott: Other things the week after that, the greatest convention except for PAX Prime.

462
00:23:57,474 --> 00:23:57,890
Rym: PAX East.

463
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:05,030
Rym: We will be presenting at least one panel, the one that is announced Friday, 1pm, in the Badger Theater.

464
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,410
Scott: Otherwise, we'll be enforcing and playing Netrunner and such.

465
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:10,849
Rym: Why no one will game with you.

466
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:11,989
Scott: Come see that.

467
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,810
Rym: It's about exactly what you think it's about.

468
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,063
Scott: It's possible that we might do another panel.

469
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:18,130
Scott: that's not yet on the schedule.

470
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,825
Scott: If that's on the schedule, you'll be able to see that too.

471
00:24:20,886 --> 00:24:21,550
Scott: Who knows when.

472
00:24:21,854 --> 00:24:22,006
Rym: Yup.

473
00:24:22,576 --> 00:24:22,928
Scott: Or if.

474
00:24:23,532 --> 00:24:29,630
Rym: So, not too long after that, April 25th, 26th, 27th, we will be at Zenkai Con for two of those days.

475
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,055
Rym: Whoa.

476
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,698
Rym: We're doing a bunch of panels.

477
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:33,430
Rym: I don't think the schedule's published yet.

478
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,270
Scott: Don't go to Zenkai Con unless you really, really, really like anime cons.

479
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,530
Rym: Zenkai Con is worth going to in one of two cases.

480
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:43,290
Rym: Anime is your fucking thing, and you have money.

481
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:48,790
Scott: And you love those, like you're a cosplay person, you love doing those anime cons for all that they are.

482
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:53,970
Rym: Or, you like anime, and you live near the convention center.

483
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:54,830
Scott: Super near the convention.

484
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,390
Rym: If you live nearby to where you can just go there for a day, pretty much any con like this is worth going to.

485
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,890
Scott: Zenkai Con is not worth traveling or hoteling for.

486
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,110
Rym: Well, we're traveling and hoteling for it.

487
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,050
Scott: If you are a person who is like us, but not a panel doer.

488
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:09,513
Rym: What?

489
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,629
Rym: I thought it was near Philly.

490
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,549
Rym: Apparently it's 90 minutes away from Philly?

491
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:14,710
Scott: Yeah, it's out in the sticks.

492
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,090
Scott: Yeah, how the fuck is this place?

493
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,401
Scott: I mean, Philly's already the sticks.

494
00:25:17,422 --> 00:25:18,249
Scott: This isn't like the twigs.

495
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:25,403
Rym: Oh, I clicked on the link that tells you how far away, and I got the requested page.

496
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:29,050
Rym: slash droop slash node slash 87 could not be found.

497
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,589
Rym: Sorry, Zenkai Con.

498
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:31,390
Scott: Sorry.

499
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,669
Scott: We're doing a bunch of panels there.

500
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,430
Scott: We got to be honest.

501
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,610
Scott: I mean, the reason we go to Zenkai Con is because our friends staff slash run it.

502
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,349
Scott: And that shows what kind of people we are.

503
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,030
Scott: If we did not do that, if that was not the case, it would not be on our radar.

504
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:45,766
Rym: I'm going to beat the jerk.

505
00:25:46,252 --> 00:25:49,209
Scott: Anime cons just as minor as this one that are closer to us.

506
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,390
Rym: There are three ways to get us to come to your convention.

507
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,708
Rym: One, impress us.

508
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,927
Rym: Two, pay us.

509
00:25:55,331 --> 00:25:56,468
Rym: Three, be friends with us.

510
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,170
Scott: Right.

511
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,541
Scott: That's it.

512
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,449
Scott: Then we feel some sort of obligation to go.

513
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:05,050
Rym: Four, if I can get to your con via the New York City subway, and I don't have to...

514
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,190
Scott: I would go to your con by Metro North Railroad if I could go and come back in the same day.

515
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:10,790
Rym: Alright.

516
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:14,210
Rym: You have to be connected to the greater mass transit region of New York City.

517
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,608
Scott: I'm not using Jersey Transit, though.

518
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:15,816
Rym: No.

519
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:17,409
Rym: I said New York City.

520
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,970
Rym: Path doesn't count.

521
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:19,490
Scott: Right.

522
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,470
Scott: If I have to use a path train, this ain't happening.

523
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:22,630
Scott: Or an Amtrak.

524
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,446
Scott: That's not happening, either.

525
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,309
Rym: Yeah, no Amtrak.

526
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,210
Scott: Bolt bus, maybe, if it's a really good con.

527
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:27,638
Rym: Yep.

528
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:31,470
Rym: I'm going to be in Paris the week before PAX East, so any cool nerds hanging out?

529
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,950
Rym: I might be able to hang out with you, though.

530
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:35,990
Scott: And I guess there won't be any GeekNights that week.

531
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:37,550
Rym: Yeah, no GeekNights before PAX.

532
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,390
Scott: Why don't we do GeekNights in Paris?

533
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,269
Scott: Get your Skype going on.

534
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:41,509
Rym: We could try that.

535
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:43,249
Rym: Might be able to work that out.

536
00:26:43,431 --> 00:26:45,630
Scott: Why don't we do a Google Hangout, right?

537
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,550
Scott: We'll do a live Google Hangout.

538
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,830
Scott: It'll become a Google Hangout on air on YouTube.

539
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,090
Rym: Maybe I'll do that every time I'm in another country.

540
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,270
Scott: And then you could be all, like, Eiffel Tower, and I'll be all Empire State Building.

541
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,869
Rym: Je suis l'oie de la point d'etat!

542
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:57,070
Rym: Je pense français!

543
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,824
Scott: And I'll be all, "Mine is bigger than

544
00:26:58,844 --> 00:26:59,167
Scott: yours.".

545
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:05,290
Rym: I'm really excited to be going to Paris now that Paris's pollution is almost as bad as Beijing's.

546
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,650
Scott: Is that really true?

547
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:07,509
Rym: It's really bad.

548
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:09,070
Scott: I didn't think there were factories in Paris.

549
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,750
Rym: Paris actually is having some serious problems lately.

550
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,610
Rym: And they've banned half of car traffic, like a lot of other cities do, to cut down on the pollution.

551
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:17,284
Scott: Okay.

552
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,585
Rym: They do it even odd on the license plates.

553
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:20,030
Rym: now, I think.

554
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,065
Scott: Bring me back some breads.

555
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,890
Rym: Yeah, that'll make it through customs.

556
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,029
Scott: It's just bread.

557
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:28,030
Rym: Yeah, that'll make it through me sitting on a plane with it.

558
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,230
Scott: Bring back yeast.

559
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,710
Rym: I don't want to transport organisms via international travel.

560
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:36,669
Scott: Anyway.

561
00:27:37,052 --> 00:27:40,130
Rym: Also, it is so fucking hard to get flights to and from Boston, Jesus.

562
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:46,670
Scott: Just to finish off the meta moment quickly, you can find us everywhere on the internet that people are doing things.

563
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:51,910
Scott: Google+, Facebook, Twitter, even IRC, Twitch, YouTube, every place.

564
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,389
Scott: Our website, frontroadcrew.com.

565
00:27:54,971 --> 00:28:01,290
Scott: You should go to those places, go to our forum, go everywhere that we are on the internet and be with us on the internet where we truly live.

566
00:28:01,992 --> 00:28:03,710
Scott: Not in Paris or New York, but the internet.

567
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:06,870
Rym: So, I'm kind of worried that Flickr is going to die.

568
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:08,968
Scott: It'll die sometime.

569
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:12,329
Rym: I think it might be sooner than later because on one hand...

570
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,490
Scott: Well, I mean, some years.

571
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,070
Rym: Well, I remember a couple years ago when Yahoo... Well, not a call of God.

572
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,770
Rym: Whenever Yahoo bought it, I remember thinking right then and there, this is going to die.

573
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:26,710
Rym: And I remember backing up everything I'd ever uploaded because I was so afraid that Flickr was going to die then.

574
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:31,210
Scott: I've already got the backups in terms of Lightroom and whatnot, so I'm set.

575
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:43,669
Rym: But now, the thing is, I figured with the new CEO and with Yahoo trying to double down on stuff, I figured maybe Flickr, which is one of their only worthwhile products, I figured they would actually invest in it.

576
00:28:44,171 --> 00:28:45,828
Rym: So far, they have not invested in it.

577
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,770
Rym: The API is barely responsive and barely available.

578
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:56,390
Rym: And most tellingly, when I complain about problems on Twitter and I @ them, they never respond.

579
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,929
Scott: They probably just don't have a social media person managing that account.

580
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:01,350
Rym: Sign number one, your company is fucked.

581
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,909
Rym: You don't have a social media person managing that shit.

582
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:09,450
Scott: I mean, yes, Yahoo may abandon or kill Flickr.

583
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,090
Scott: It is somewhat more likely than many other things, and it is a bigger, more popular service than many other things.

584
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,910
Rym: Dude, I have complained about way smaller things than Flickr.

585
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:23,070
Rym: And even without adding them, the companies involved find me on Twitter and tweet at me.

586
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,769
Scott: But I'm not worried about it, right?

587
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:34,850
Scott: Because, look, Little Old Delicious was abandoned by Yahoo, and some other company bought it, resurrected it, and it's still running, even though I'm guaranteed there's no way it's making money or anything.

588
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:37,230
Rym: I don't know if they can make money off of Flickr.

589
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:46,890
Scott: Flickr is so big and so popular, if Yahoo bails on it, someone will buy it, and that person will be easily able to make it successful.

590
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,590
Rym: I worry that Flickr's business model might be untenable.

591
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:51,649
Scott: The worst case scenario for Flickr...

592
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,041
Rym: I mean, I pay for Flickr, guys.

593
00:29:53,404 --> 00:29:54,130
Rym: That says a lot.

594
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,590
Rym: There are not many things that I will pay to use on the Internet.

595
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:07,429
Scott: The worst case scenario, if Flickr goes out, it'll become a Google Reader situation, where all these competitors will show up, and you'll be able to click a button and migrate your Flickr to them, and you'll be all set.

596
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:13,490
Rym: My trouble is that Flickr's appeal is that I can upload, basically, the most gigantic images.

597
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,430
Scott: That is, I mean, really, I would much rather use... Yeah, Picasa, Google, whatever.

598
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,010
Scott: Picasa has shit to your functionality.

599
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,950
Scott: I mean, when I started using Flickr, Flickr was the only game in town, right?

600
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,030
Scott: But nowadays, I think Google's a little better.

601
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:36,130
Scott: But the advantage of Flickr is that for a very small amount of money, like Libsyn, I can upload infinity, high-res photos, all I want.

602
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,890
Rym: And I have a camera that, I mean, my RAWs are 20 to 30 megabytes each.

603
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,550
Scott: Right, and it's like, I'm not one of those photographers who's only uploading low-res JPEGs because they care about someone stealing.

604
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,370
Scott: I'm all Creative Commons-ing, which is another great feature of Flickr.

605
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,190
Scott: They were, like, one of the first places to be all Creative Commons-y.

606
00:30:50,253 --> 00:30:50,362
Scott: Yeah.

607
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:58,050
Scott: So, you know, I would much rather use the Google stuff, but Google lowered their prices recently, actually, to be more reasonable.

608
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,507
Rym: With the number of images I take.

609
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:05,769
Scott: They're not as reasonable as Flickr if you want to do all your photos at ridiculous high-res just because you're a nice guy.

610
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,029
Rym: Also, Picasa's sharing and all this stuff just kind of suck.

611
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:11,589
Rym: Flickr actually built all that stuff out ages ago.

612
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,010
Rym: So, what do you do when these services die?

613
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:19,250
Rym: I mean, I got a Wikipedia page of the list of everything that Google has ever killed.

614
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:21,950
Rym: And it's substantial.

615
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,830
Scott: Well, I think the thing to remember, right, is that what is the cloud?

616
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:34,190
Scott: And the best way to describe the cloud to people who don't know, or even to yourself, if you think you know, is say a sentence with the word "the cloud" in it and use the word "the cloud" properly.

617
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,306
Scott: Then rewrite the sentence and replace "the cloud" with the words "someone else's

618
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:38,708
Scott: computer.".

619
00:31:40,572 --> 00:31:44,030
Scott: It's like, yeah, all my photos are stored in the cloud by Flickr.

620
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,010
Scott: All my photos are stored on someone else's computer, run by Flickr.

621
00:31:48,512 --> 00:31:56,210
Rym: So, you've got to really think about, my stuff is stored on a bunch of other people's computers who don't know each other and kind of hate each other.

622
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,570
Scott: Right, so you just have to remember, the simplest answer is, if your shit is on someone else's computer...

623
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,130
Rym: Wait a minute, it's all on Cash's computer.

624
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:07,770
Scott: Yeah, if all your shit is on someone else's computer, you've got to have backups on your computer.

625
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,039
Rym: No, no, no, you've got to have backups on your attached storage.

626
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,260
Rym: that itself is backed up somehow, right?

627
00:32:19,662 --> 00:32:20,810
Scott: That's where you have to have things.

628
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:26,910
Scott: And sometimes it's okay to back things up on someone else's computer from someone else's computer.

629
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,649
Scott: Like, oh, back up my Flickr on Amazon S3, that's a good idea.

630
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:34,270
Scott: Because the odds of both of those going down at the same time, really low, right?

631
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:44,690
Scott: So, it's like, no matter which I have to migrate from or to, I'll be able to have my data will be somewhere on someone's computer and I'll be able to copy it to someone else's computer.

632
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:47,270
Scott: And then if they go down, I'll copy it to someone else's computer.

633
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,490
Scott: So, no matter what, my data will be on someone's computer.

634
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,049
Rym: Yep, Snorlax will never die.

635
00:32:53,751 --> 00:33:06,130
Rym: But, when it comes to cloud services, the best way to think about whether or not you have to worry about a service actually disappearing is, one, is it a service that you envision someone could make money off of if they weren't stupid?

636
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:12,349
Rym: Like, for example, Google Reader, you cannot make money, at least enough money to matter from RSS readers.

637
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:14,869
Rym: RSS, we've talked about why it's kind of dead.

638
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,263
Scott: Yep.

639
00:33:16,271 --> 00:33:17,978
Rym: You can make money off of photo sharing.

640
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:20,790
Rym: In fact, photography is getting a big boost with these Micro Four Thirds.

641
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,690
Scott: Yeah, and there's plenty, there's like this other, well, there's lots of other, photography cameras are not selling.

642
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:27,850
Rym: Cameras aren't in general.

643
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,850
Scott: Photography is a huge boost from phones in general.

644
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,244
Rym: Yeah, that too.

645
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:37,270
Scott: But, there's plenty of photography services, new ones all the time, because, yeah, you can make money with a good one.

646
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:42,370
Scott: See Instagram, see, I guess that 500 PX is the new hotness as well, right?

647
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,544
Scott: So, there will always be somewhere to put photos.

648
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:46,690
Scott: Photos will always exist.

649
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,392
Rym: Or like, Amazon.

650
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:48,778
Rym: Amazon, you know, AWS.

651
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,710
Rym: Yeah, they could just turn off their computer and you're fucked, but you know what?

652
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:56,370
Rym: If Amazon shut down tomorrow, you're fucked along- Netflix is also fucked.

653
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,998
Rym: Yeah, you're fucked along with everybody else.

654
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:02,870
Rym: You're fucked along with people who have way more money and way more guns than you.

655
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,194
Scott: Right, so you're good.

656
00:34:04,455 --> 00:34:07,167
Scott: You're sailing in a boat with badasses.

657
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:07,970
Scott: They're protecting you.

658
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:13,010
Scott: Yeah, you want to be in a boat where- If that ship sinks, they're sinking too, so they ain't letting that happen.

659
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:19,290
Rym: Yeah, the Google readership was basically just like a barge of refugees slowly sinking in the Pacific.

660
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,578
Scott: Right, just try to imagine the service as a boat.

661
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,944
Scott: See who's on the boat.

662
00:34:23,165 --> 00:34:24,330
Scott: See how awesome the boat is.

663
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,610
Rym: Google's like a flotilla of aircraft carriers and battleships.

664
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,985
Scott: Right, so it's like, Google, do they make any money on Gmail?

665
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:30,429
Scott: Yeah, they do.

666
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,455
Scott: But imagine if they didn't.

667
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,310
Scott: What kind of boat would you imagine Gmail being?

668
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:40,409
Scott: It would be this massive, luxurious cruise ship that billions of people are on all at once having an amazing party.

669
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,230
Rym: But meanwhile, Google Lively was like this dinghy that sank and no one noticed.

670
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:45,418
Rym: Right.

671
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:46,870
Scott: I don't even know what Google Lively is.

672
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,801
Rym: Oh my god, Scott, some of these are great.

673
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:50,110
Rym: Google Ideas, Google Crisis.

674
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,210
Scott: I know what Google Ideas is.

675
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:52,654
Rym: Let's see, let's see.

676
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,630
Rym: Google Lively is a 3D animated chat program.

677
00:34:57,878 --> 00:34:58,442
Rym: Oh my god.

678
00:34:58,824 --> 00:34:59,670
Scott: I never knew about this.

679
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,894
Rym: Scott, launch July 2008.

680
00:35:00,894 --> 00:35:05,030
Rym: Close December 2008.

681
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,822
Scott: Yeah, I could have predicted the year.

682
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:07,829
Scott: It was going to be the same year.

683
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,499
Rym: Google Hello?

684
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:10,368
Scott: Never heard of that.

685
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,665
Rym: Allowed a user to send images across the internet?

686
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:13,189
Rym: What?

687
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,221
Scott: Do we have that?

688
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:15,890
Scott: It's called the internet.

689
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,056
Scott: Google Buzz.

690
00:35:17,942 --> 00:35:18,525
Scott: I know what that is.

691
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:19,170
Scott: I remember Buzz.

692
00:35:19,471 --> 00:35:19,893
Scott: Google Wave.

693
00:35:19,914 --> 00:35:20,396
Scott: Squared.

694
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:21,362
Scott: Remember Sets?

695
00:35:21,563 --> 00:35:22,750
Rym: Google Sets is gone apparently.

696
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:23,980
Scott: Google Sets is really useful.

697
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:24,850
Rym: Google Sets was the best.

698
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:28,870
Rym: All we did was type a bunch of anime in that would recommend other anime that we'd like.

699
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,450
Scott: Google Lists I think was the same thing as Sets or different?

700
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:32,960
Rym: That was a different thing.

701
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,949
Rym: Google Knoll.

702
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:34,531
Scott: Yup.

703
00:35:35,056 --> 00:35:35,904
Rym: Google Wave.

704
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:36,529
Scott: I know what that is.

705
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:36,911
Scott: Yup.

706
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:38,078
Rym: Google Picnic.

707
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:39,910
Scott: Google Building Maker.

708
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:41,359
Scott: I don't know what that is.

709
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:41,480
Scott: Meebo.

710
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:42,570
Rym: Google Latitude.

711
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:43,374
Scott: Meebo?

712
00:35:43,415 --> 00:35:44,262
Scott: They bought Meebo?

713
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:45,049
Rym: Yeah.

714
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,966
Scott: But Meebo.com is where you go and you can...

715
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:52,631
Rym: Could discontinue June 6, 2013.

716
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:53,361
Scott: Meebo.

717
00:35:53,463 --> 00:35:53,869
Rym: Meebo.

718
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:59,250
Rym: It's not Google, but remember Beluga basically got bought by Facebook and then fucked to death.

719
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,499
Scott: I guess that's what happened to Meebo.

720
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,750
Scott: No, not Meebo, no.

721
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:03,131
Rym: Yeah.

722
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:04,630
Rym: Google Fast Flip.

723
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,148
Scott: I have no idea what the hell that is.

724
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,577
Rym: Google Reader.

725
00:36:07,597 --> 00:36:09,130
Rym: I don't know who used that.

726
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,029
Rym: This whole episode could be me reading these.

727
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:13,864
Scott: Let's not have it be that.

728
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:14,269
Rym: Yeah.

729
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,850
Scott: Okay, so actual technical things you have to do, right?

730
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,690
Scott: So you've been uploading your photos to Flickr, right?

731
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:21,374
Scott: Yup.

732
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:23,550
Scott: And maybe you've deleted them locally, right?

733
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,950
Scott: We're gonna assume the worst case scenario.

734
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,910
Rym: Which actually I had for a lot of my photos.

735
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:28,392
Scott: Right.

736
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:30,090
Scott: So we're gonna assume the worst case scenario here.

737
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,144
Scott: Your shit is only on Flickr, right?

738
00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:32,930
Scott: What do you do?

739
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,007
Scott: Well, Flickr has an API.

740
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:42,990
Scott: So as of today, you can actually get little scripts and programs on the internet that will actually download your photos from Flickr to your local computer.

741
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,977
Rym: With the metadata.

742
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:45,230
Rym: At least as much as it can get.

743
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,550
Scott: Yeah, with the tags, the titles, all that stuff.

744
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,710
Scott: So you need to find one of these things by Googling, I hope you have those skills, and run it.

745
00:36:52,131 --> 00:36:56,470
Scott: Then, from now on, anytime you upload stuff to Flickr, just think of that as sharing the photo.

746
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:02,530
Scott: Keep all your photos locally, following all good backup procedures, which we will not discuss because that's another show that we've already done.

747
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,490
Scott: Okay, so that's pretty simple right there, right?

748
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,510
Scott: Oh, but wait, Flickr actually goes down one day.

749
00:37:09,112 --> 00:37:10,029
Scott: Now what do you do?

750
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,930
Rym: Yup, I get to re-share all your shit somehow.

751
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:20,590
Scott: Right, you need to pick a different service that does the same thing, and use their API to re-upload everything with that metadata to them.

752
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:27,290
Scott: Also, you'll probably get some warning that Flickr's about to go down, and you can re-run that Flickr backup script to get that metadata.

753
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,530
Scott: Also, you can maybe set that up to run weekly or something like that.

754
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,237
Rym: Yeah, well I've tried.

755
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:40,410
Rym: I set up my two-way sync, so basically, in Lightroom, to give you an example of this workflow, to keep myself independent, I create sets in Lightroom.

756
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,330
Rym: Lightroom is the authoritative source.

757
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,887
Scott: Yup, me too.

758
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:49,889
Rym: I will create separate sets in the Flickr integration piece, and I'll put photos into that.

759
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,410
Rym: So I only put the photos into that that I'm publishing.

760
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,388
Rym: I don't put everything in there.

761
00:37:54,053 --> 00:38:00,050
Rym: And then those sync up and down, so if I fuck with the photo on Flickr, that metadata comes back into Lightroom.

762
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:05,250
Rym: If I delete the photo on Flickr, it deletes it from that set in Lightroom.

763
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:10,789
Scott: Lightroom is fancy Adobe Creative Cloud software, but there are plenty of other software packages you can get that do similar things.

764
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:16,950
Rym: Dude, the first time when Yahoo was buying Flickr, a lot of people sold a $10 application that will download everything.

765
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,890
Scott: You don't really need an application if you know how to write a program or run a script.

766
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,380
Scott: There's free things.

767
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,250
Scott: There's all kinds of ways to do it.

768
00:38:22,631 --> 00:38:24,362
Rym: The internet will tell you how to do it.

769
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:25,490
Rym: There'll be facts overnight.

770
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,729
Scott: Something's not going to go down suddenly and disappear, but there are other issues.

771
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,070
Rym: Well, if it does, that's a separate problem.

772
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,860
Scott: There are other issues.

773
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:37,950
Scott: For example, on your blog, you've had all these links pointing at various photos on your Flickr, and now those are not working links anymore.

774
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:39,669
Scott: What do you do about that?

775
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:47,190
Rym: Unless you have a really advanced CMS content management system, you're basically fucked.

776
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,110
Scott: It is possible, but it's a huge pain in the ass.

777
00:38:50,270 --> 00:39:02,370
Scott: Basically, what you need to do is look at the stuff you've backed up from Flickr, figure out what the URLs were, then search your database or whatever for any links to those photos.

778
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:12,908
Scott: Then, after you upload to the new replacement service that you're using, figure out what the new URLs are, match the new URLs up with the old URLs, and edit all of them.

779
00:39:13,973 --> 00:39:16,050
Scott: It's up to Flickr to maybe do some redirecting.

780
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,109
Scott: You can't control that.

781
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,450
Rym: Flickr's not going to redirect shit.

782
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:18,947
Scott: Right.

783
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:25,950
Scott: Other services, say like Delicious, you don't really have to do anything.

784
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:32,990
Scott: You can just do your backups of Delicious once in a while, and you don't really need a replacement service for that so much.

785
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:37,870
Rym: Well, you're getting into... Web browser bookmarks the replacement for that service.

786
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,490
Scott: Oh, that's not a good replacement at all.

787
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,269
Rym: It's better than nothing.

788
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:40,849
Scott: I guess.

789
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,089
Scott: Plus Chrome syncs.

790
00:39:42,231 --> 00:39:48,670
Scott: I mean, the download you get from Delicious is basically like a big HTML or XML file or whatever, and it's just useful on its own.

791
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:49,998
Rym: Thus, you've danced around the issue.

792
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,068
Rym: Here's the key.

793
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:55,550
Rym: Don't use services that don't have APIs.

794
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:57,189
Scott: Or don't have backups.

795
00:39:57,732 --> 00:40:04,428
Scott: Twitter only somewhat more recently allowed you to actually get an archive of all your tweets, and Gmail also allows this now too.

796
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:13,370
Scott: Put a reminder in your reminder thing, because some of these had to be done manually by clicking, that you should do that every week, month, whatever.

797
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:18,910
Scott: I'm doing it every month, and I'm putting them in S3 and Google Drive and my local drive, my local NAS.

798
00:40:19,893 --> 00:40:21,089
Scott: Safe places to store stuff.

799
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:22,218
Rym: Yup.

800
00:40:24,374 --> 00:40:25,690
Scott: What other kind of situation might I have?

801
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,450
Scott: A hard one to deal with might be something like YouTube, right?

802
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,209
Rym: Well, again, someone can make money with that.

803
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:32,633
Scott: Sure.

804
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:34,890
Scott: I don't think YouTube is very... YouTube is probably the least likely to die.

805
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:42,629
Rym: It's one of those situations, though, kind of like Flickr, where if I didn't have YouTube available, I guess I could use, like, Vimeo or something.

806
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,210
Scott: But what if Vimeo is something that could die?

807
00:40:45,832 --> 00:40:45,921
Rym: Yeah.

808
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:46,553
Rym: Maybe.

809
00:40:46,574 --> 00:40:46,902
Rym: Possibly.

810
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,770
Rym: Well, the trouble is that's why...

811
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,169
Scott: They make money, but it's possible.

812
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,610
Scott: It's more likely than YouTube dying.

813
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:57,210
Rym: We're pro, but we're not pro in the sense that, like, when we, like, we do these videos, right?

814
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,229
Rym: Like GeekNights Presents or our panel lectures.

815
00:40:59,912 --> 00:41:09,370
Rym: I have a ton of raw video and the projects, but eventually, once I've made a lecture and it's done, I'm never gonna use that footage again, I do delete a lot of the original source material.

816
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:10,770
Scott: Because it just takes up too much room.

817
00:41:11,211 --> 00:41:12,390
Scott: I can't back all that up effectively.

818
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:12,970
Rym: Yeah, I could.

819
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:15,570
Rym: It's not worth the effort and/or expense.

820
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:21,649
Scott: So then I render, like, the final video and upload it to YouTube, but then I usually delete the rendered thing...

821
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,219
Rym: Whoa, no, no.

822
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:22,790
Rym: I do not.

823
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:23,470
Rym: See, Scott.

824
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:31,930
Rym: I delete the 40 gigabytes of, like, B-roll and raw masters, but what I do is I'll usually render out a watchable version.

825
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:36,790
Rym: Like, one, I can just watch on my computer, and then I render out the one that I upload to YouTube.

826
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:38,582
Rym: The one that's like a 50 or 100 megabit per second.

827
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,089
Rym: It's like a 40 gigabyte bullshit file.

828
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,430
Rym: So just crazy, crazy high quality, and that's what I upload to YouTube.

829
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:53,430
Rym: But that way I have a usable video and the highest quality master I'm gonna get.

830
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:59,110
Scott: Why are you rendering a video that's like 100 megabits per second when your source raw isn't 100 megabits per second?

831
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:00,230
Rym: That was an example.

832
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,610
Rym: Actually, what I do is I render it at YouTube's recommended.

833
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,709
Rym: They recommend between 20 and 50 as just what you should upload.

834
00:42:08,312 --> 00:42:10,649
Scott: Your camera, what's the bit rate that it records at?

835
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,109
Rym: Yeah, well, it depends on the video.

836
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:19,210
Scott: So if you're rendering at, like, 20, but your camera's only -- I mean, most cameras are not recording more than, like, eight.

837
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:21,690
Scott: They're not much at all, right?

838
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:25,740
Scott: It's crazy that the GH4 does, like, 100, or maybe in some cases 200.

839
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,830
Scott: That's ridiculous.

840
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:27,211
Scott: Yep.

841
00:42:27,472 --> 00:42:33,322
Rym: The key is I keep the highest quality master I could get, and I keep that forever.

842
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:37,169
Rym: It's on my NAS up there, and it's also backed up somewhere else.

843
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:39,510
Rym: In fact, I have a rolling archive.

844
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:42,950
Scott: We're not talking about just regular backups.

845
00:42:43,315 --> 00:42:44,270
Scott: we already talked about, right?

846
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:53,528
Rym: Yeah, but the point is I keep all the masters, so if I had to, I could take the final versions of every video we've ever made and upload them all to another site if I needed to.

847
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,507
Rym: But I do not keep the material.

848
00:42:56,568 --> 00:42:58,890
Rym: I would need to remake those videos clean.

849
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:10,409
Scott: Another good strategy is to -- it's like there's lots of all these services, and they all have APIs that need to be talked to, but nothing is ever quite as good as just a Linux computer, which can do anything, right?

850
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:23,685
Scott: So getting, like, a very small, very cheap virtual private server, like from Linode, DigitalOcean, or some other hosting provider, even Amazon EC2, you know, some hosting provider that you're pretty sure is not gonna die, right?

851
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,510
Scott: It's just a Linux computer, so it can always be replaced by going to another hosting provider, right?

852
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,830
Scott: It's like if Linode goes down, I can go to Amazon.

853
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:35,149
Scott: You know, it's like there's always gonna be someone selling Linux machines.

854
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:54,189
Scott: So then what you do is you create on that machine that very tiny, very inexpensive server all these scripts that are basically doing all these backups, like backing up the Flickr, backing up, you know, the Gmail, backing up Delicious, and that basically is handling all that biz for you all the time.

855
00:43:54,674 --> 00:44:00,869
Scott: And if anything ever happens to it, well, you can just -- it's a Linux machine, so you can easily copy it somewhere else.

856
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:02,390
Rym: If you have Fios, put it in your house.

857
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,330
Rym: Just build a desktop computer, put it -- you know, something you're not gonna use on a daily basis.

858
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,610
Rym: Get a shit ton of cheapo, like, two-terabyte hard disks.

859
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,930
Scott: The cheapo magnetic ones.

860
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,019
Rym: Yeah, just 5,400 RPM bullshit.

861
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:21,990
Rym: Just throw them in there in some sort of, like, RAID 10, 'cause whatever, and then just have that sit with your Fios constantly scheduled archive backups of everything.

862
00:44:22,154 --> 00:44:22,345
Rym: Mm-hmm.

863
00:44:22,732 --> 00:44:23,463
Rym: And just let it run.

864
00:44:23,524 --> 00:44:23,890
Rym: Let it hum.

865
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:26,730
Scott: There are other things you might not think about backing up.

866
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:30,748
Scott: The real hard problem is not something going down and surprising you.

867
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,710
Scott: It's something you didn't realize that you wanted to back up, right?

868
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,690
Scott: Like, data that you have you didn't really think about.

869
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,309
Rym: Like, if you use Spotify or Netflix, and you, like -- you like musics.

870
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:44,569
Rym: Like, you star some music, you make some playlists.

871
00:44:44,735 --> 00:44:44,930
Rym: Yup.

872
00:44:45,932 --> 00:44:51,430
Rym: You've raided, like, 4,000 movies in Netflix, 'cause I learned something disturbing, actually, yesterday.

873
00:44:51,673 --> 00:44:51,802
Rym: Mm-hmm.

874
00:44:52,110 --> 00:45:06,908
Rym: Apparently -- and I haven't verified this myself -- if you cancel the DVD part of Netflix, you can't see DVD-only movies in the interfaces anymore, and all your reviews of them and your star ratings are no longer accessible, and they'll never be recommended to you.

875
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,984
Scott: What if you pay again?

876
00:45:09,065 --> 00:45:09,650
Scott: Will it come back?

877
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:10,428
Rym: I don't know.

878
00:45:11,132 --> 00:45:12,870
Rym: I got to do some investigative journalism on that front.

879
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,899
Scott: Why cancel Netflix altogether?

880
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:15,050
Scott: So I lost everything.

881
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:16,446
Rym: Yeah, I've thought about canceling it.

882
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:18,889
Scott: But, yeah, stuff like that.

883
00:45:19,352 --> 00:45:26,669
Scott: Or another good example would be, like, not your Gmail, which is obvious, but, like, your Google Chat history, all your hangouts, every hangout you've ever done.

884
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:28,029
Rym: Well, that's just in my history.

885
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:29,909
Rym: It's right there in my email.

886
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,057
Rym: It's in the same interface.

887
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:33,450
Rym: It's in the same web screen.

888
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,257
Scott: But it used to be.

889
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:35,490
Scott: It used to not be, right?

890
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:37,710
Scott: And maybe you've got, like, an IRC channel.

891
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:39,429
Scott: You got a bot, like, backing that shit up.

892
00:45:39,975 --> 00:45:40,550
Scott: Well, you know what, kids?

893
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,610
Scott: Everything anyone's ever chatted.

894
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:53,170
Rym: As I said in the backups episode, I have an archive of every online digital conversation of text, typing, I have ever had since 1996.

895
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:53,330
Rym: Mm-hmm.

896
00:45:53,592 --> 00:45:56,410
Rym: Everyone, every IM, every email.

897
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,710
Rym: So take that, people.

898
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,668
Rym: The first thing I ever said to Scott was, "Hey, I'm that long-haired guy.

899
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,004
Rym: You want to meet at Gracie's for dinner at 6 before we go to the D&D

900
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:06,247
Rym: thing?".

901
00:46:07,115 --> 00:46:08,830
Rym: That was the first message I ever sent to Scott.

902
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:10,829
Rym: I looked it up ahead of time at this show.

903
00:46:12,692 --> 00:46:18,690
Scott: What kind of other things do I use where I'm storing my information on someone else's computer?

904
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:25,187
Rym: It's mostly the throwaway comments, like, "I review something on a site, and I've reviewed enough things to where.

905
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:27,127
Rym: now I have the sort of history of recommendations and

906
00:46:27,147 --> 00:46:27,430
Rym: reviews.".

907
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:30,130
Rym: Like, the list of restaurants I order food from on Grubhub.

908
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:37,650
Rym: If Grubhub disappeared, I would not remember the names of most of the restaurants that I order food from online that I've never visited in person.

909
00:46:38,211 --> 00:46:39,750
Rym: I don't even know where they are.

910
00:46:40,052 --> 00:46:41,730
Scott: There are some other things that might be kind of tricky.

911
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,429
Scott: For example, Steam, right?

912
00:46:44,711 --> 00:46:53,270
Scott: On Steam, you should go to every Steam game in your list, and I don't know if you should necessarily, like, install every Steam game just in case Steam goes away, right?

913
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:56,822
Scott: But maybe go through and get all the keys, 'cause you can do that.

914
00:46:56,843 --> 00:46:59,449
Scott: You can say, "Show me the CD keys from this game," right?

915
00:47:00,071 --> 00:47:02,690
Scott: And get them all into, like, a text file somewhere.

916
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:17,009
Scott: That way, you know, if the game -- if Steam disappears, you can go find the installer for that game, install it legitimately and not, you know, piratey and spyware -- malwarey, and just paste your CD key in, and the game will work, right, even when Steam is gone.

917
00:47:17,575 --> 00:47:19,250
Scott: You'll still be able to get the installer from somewhere.

918
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:32,010
Rym: Yeah, it's hard to say, 'cause at the same time, if Steam went down, it would piss off the kinds of people who would make sure that every one of those games was immediately available on some sort of pirated fashion.

919
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:42,130
Scott: I mean, but in fact, if you're really paranoid about something like that, you know, your option is basically get a giant hard drive and install every Steam game you have all at once.

920
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:45,530
Scott: Unlike me, where I only install the ones I'm sort of playing recently.

921
00:47:45,631 --> 00:47:52,170
Rym: If you're extra paranoid, then put the computer you downloaded them into into offline mode and then hibernate it.

922
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,049
Scott: But any time you buy a new game, you got to turn it on, download the game, and hibernate it again.

923
00:47:56,491 --> 00:48:03,328
Rym: And then you keep VMs, images, of those hibernated states, so you can theoretically play those games forever no matter what.

924
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,550
Rym: That's not a bad idea, actually.

925
00:48:06,852 --> 00:48:07,430
Scott: It's a lot of effort.

926
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,229
Rym: I'm not gonna do it.

927
00:48:08,611 --> 00:48:10,910
Rym: If Steam goes down, I'm just gonna rabble about it.

928
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:17,490
Scott: Yeah, it's really annoying, you know, some of these things don't have, like, a backup, you know, a way to do something about it.

929
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:30,469
Rym: The real future is that normal people don't know or care, whatever, but if you're nerdy and you're smart, try to only rely upon services that give you an API and/or are federated.

930
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:36,828
Rym: If a service is not one or both of those things, you should assume that it'll disappear while you're still alive.

931
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:41,790
Scott: There's a trend lately of people doing things they want to disappear, like Snapchat and stuff.

932
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:42,950
Rym: Yeah, ephemeral communication.

933
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:49,808
Rym: Even though those things -- Actually, my only interest in those services is making clients that save everything anyway because fuck you.

934
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,969
Scott: Right, well, people already can just take screenshots and do.

935
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,630
Scott: It's not a big deal, but it's, you know, whatever.

936
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:57,263
Scott: Yeah.

937
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:02,449
Scott: It's great for the person -- It's really great for the company that runs it because they basically don't have to store it.

938
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:07,885
Scott: They're basically like, "Hey, let's just run a shitty service where it's so cheap because we don't have to buy a million hard

939
00:49:07,905 --> 00:49:08,249
Scott: drives.".

940
00:49:08,372 --> 00:49:08,568
Scott: Brilliant.

941
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:09,245
Scott: Brilliant.

942
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:11,988
Scott: Super easy infrastructure compared to anyone else.

943
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:20,129
Rym: So, if I had to guess things that are gonna die in the foreseeable near future, like years out, Google Voice is definitely gonna disappear.

944
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,149
Scott: Well, that's for sure.

945
00:49:22,813 --> 00:49:25,030
Rym: I wonder what's gonna happen to Delicious in the long term.

946
00:49:25,472 --> 00:49:29,289
Rym: I don't -- Delicious, you know -- It costs so little to run is the only reason I think it'll hang on.

947
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,549
Scott: And, like, people are working on it, and they bought it.

948
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,946
Scott: It's like, but is it -- You know, it's a coin toss.

949
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,770
Scott: I think it's got better odds than Google Voice, though.

950
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:40,089
Rym: I think Pandora's gonna die, and I think Spotify's not gonna make it, either.

951
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:41,389
Scott: I don't know.

952
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:46,630
Scott: Those might be the kind of things where, like, Sirius XM Radio, it'll get merged, right?

953
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:46,737
Rym: Yeah.

954
00:49:47,311 --> 00:49:48,309
Scott: I think that's what can happen.

955
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,830
Scott: There'll be, like, one thing that takes -- Like, RDO, all three of those.

956
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:52,409
Rym: Well, I'll say this.

957
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:58,270
Rym: All your metadata in all those kinds of services will probably die unless you happen to pick the one that everyone merges into.

958
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,270
Scott: That's why I don't put metadata into those services.

959
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:10,950
Scott: I'm actually using Amazon Cloud Player, and that's a pretty good one because basically all it does is I'm actually using local iTunes, which is super safe, and then you basically mirror that to Amazon Cloud Player.

960
00:50:12,173 --> 00:50:13,530
Rym: I think Citi Bike's gonna die.

961
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:14,850
Scott: That's not a cloud service.

962
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:15,789
Rym: It's a physical service.

963
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,240
Rym: Sure.

964
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:17,409
Rym: I think it'll die, though.

965
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:19,608
Scott: What else?

966
00:50:20,412 --> 00:50:20,750
Scott: I don't know.

967
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:24,509
Scott: I mean, Flickr has probably better odds than Delicious, right, of being safe.

968
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:27,289
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, I don't trust Yahoo.

969
00:50:27,772 --> 00:50:27,923
Scott: No.

970
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:38,527
Scott: But, yeah, anything that's, like, a tiny startup has really bad odds unless it's been -- And, you know, even if it gets bought by someone huge, it's like Beluga dead, right?

971
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:44,050
Scott: It's like that GroupMe thing, that's as unstable as Beluga was, right, maybe a little bit more stable.

972
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:52,850
Rym: And those two services are not likely to have competitor replacements because Google Hangouts and/or Facebook combined cover the use cases.

973
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,930
Scott: You know, there's just -- what else is there?

974
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:05,090
Scott: I guess Adobe Behance is gonna be -- I mean, Adobe's basically just gonna -- Behance is on this kind of upswing lately, which is interesting.

975
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:12,110
Scott: Right, and Adobe Creative Cloud Storage, it's like, that's one of those things where I don't think too many people are using it compared to other things.

976
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,649
Rym: I've never uploaded anything to it.

977
00:51:13,811 --> 00:51:17,730
Rym: Right, I've used it a tiny, tiny bit, but -- I should use it more, actually, 'cause it's free.

978
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,390
Rym: I already pay for the Adobe stuff.

979
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:31,290
Scott: Right, but, like, because it's something that people pay a zillion dollars for and Adobe just gives it to you for free, it's the kind of thing that will stick around likely, you know, probably even more likely than Flickr to stick around.

980
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:36,850
Rym: Well, I think professional tools that cost significant money are a lot safer.

981
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:41,050
Scott: Even if they don't have -- it's like, you don't need to have a lot of users to stick around, right?

982
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:41,631
Rym: Yeah.

983
00:51:41,651 --> 00:51:45,450
Scott: Well, also, like, Adobe Creative Cloud -- 'Cause people are paying for it even if they're not using it.

984
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:50,070
Rym: If all the things around that go down, that affects entire industries.

985
00:51:51,351 --> 00:51:53,909
Rym: Industries of professionals use that software in a daily basis.

986
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:57,228
Rym: I'm using it right now for GeekNights, looking at Audition.

987
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,340
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

988
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,480
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

989
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:15,880
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

990
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:23,580
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows -- Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

991
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,070
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

992
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,380
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

993
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,500
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
