00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,884
Rym: It's Thursday November 13th.

2
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:12,088
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:15,478
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight Thursdays.

4
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:16,300
Rym: change it up.

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:39,111
Scott: Let's do this Stayed home today Went to work I'm gonna stay home tomorrow too, and I don't even have to use days or anything.

6
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:42,040
Rym: see I actually have too many days.

7
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:44,162
Rym: I got to figure out exactly which days I'm taking.

8
00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:44,584
Rym: I'm.

9
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:51,317
Rym: I think I really think I'm gonna take off like every Wednesday in December and then like the last two weeks of the month.

10
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,339
Scott: yeah I guess like this of this work that I'm I need to do that needs to get done pretty soon.

11
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:57,644
Rym: I'm in that boat.

12
00:00:57,664 --> 00:00:59,832
Rym: I'm behind on every project.

13
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:01,297
Scott: I had I should probably do.

14
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:02,020
Scott: It's just one work.

15
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:07,600
Scott: It's not a bunch of projects one thing I'm supposed to do but and they're like yeah, you know you can work on it from home.

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,884
Scott: You got the VPN working right.

17
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:12,436
Rym: ah you know what I've actually been working from home a lot lately.

18
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:13,680
Rym: because it's like I'm at work.

19
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:32,179
Rym: Alright I can either go home on the 410 train And then if I have another hour work to do I can just do it at home in the comfort of my house in My Aeron chair with food and drink and music and I can be mostly naked Or I can stay at work take a crappy crowded train home get stuck in traffic on my way back.

20
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,800
Scott: Yeah, I'm just not gonna do it until Monday.

21
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:41,225
Scott: I'm gonna instead do what I did today, which is spend most of the day working on GeekNights shit Website and such.

22
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:42,108
Rym: see I don't.

23
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:46,939
Rym: actually I really don't feel that I've been working a lot of extra hours this week But I don't well actually for the last like month.

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:59,966
Rym: But I don't feel bad about it because I still work fewer hours than a lot of other people Not just in my company But just in general like people seems like a lot of people we know will put in a lot of overtime with no real benefit.

25
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:00,813
Scott: yeah, I don't know why.

26
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:09,683
Rym: I mean if it's a choice between Do the overtime or you lose your job, and you're not in a place where you can easily get another job quickly well I mean this.

27
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,759
Scott: the thing is there's a lot of people out there right who?

28
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,460
Scott: Actually get paid hourly and make overtime money in those people if they've got nothing better to do.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:41,097
Scott: You know if they're just gonna go home and play NS Or if they're just gonna go home, and you know play World of Warcraft or something I mean think about this if you work two hours of overtime Even if because of that you have to eat dinner like you know at a restaurant or a takeout place instead of eating dinner At home you still make enough money to make back that.

30
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,932
Scott: and Unless you're doing something after work.

31
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:45,560
Scott: You're not really losing anything.

32
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:54,272
Rym: But you're forgetting something because remember there was a time a time when we were in college a time When I often could not afford food.

33
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:56,160
Rym: I could not afford food.

34
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:57,745
Rym: I had a job.

35
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:07,898
Rym: very often the the the manager would come out and say something to the effect of Hey if someone wants to go home right now they can and I would be the first one out the door.

36
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:19,620
Rym: well The boss would say hey anyone wants him overtime And I'd be hell no and then I'd go home and realize that I didn't have any food or money to buy food.

37
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:28,337
Scott: The thing is is that when in those in those times when you left work immediately it was summer in College and awesome.

38
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:31,510
Scott: so the time you weren't spending at work was time of awesome.

39
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:38,609
Scott: So I'm talking about someone who if they leave work is gonna go home to a family they hate or go home to a TV.

40
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:48,861
Rym: No, I posit this to you if you're good if you're one of those people who's going home to the family you hate There is a far bigger problem in your life than working overtime.

41
00:03:48,881 --> 00:04:00,970
Scott: This is true, but at least under overtime is understandable If you are that person if you are a salaried employee like ribbon I and Your pay doesn't change depending on how many hours you work.

42
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,402
Scott: That's simply a matter of either work and get paid at work.

43
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,570
Rym: and don't guess the critical part cuz that IBM.

44
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:09,355
Rym: No, I wasn't gonna get promoted.

45
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:12,104
Rym: just cuz the way IBM was nothing was gonna happen to me.

46
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:17,149
Rym: good if I worked 60 hours or 10 Hours, so I just did my job and that was it the hospital.

47
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,536
Rym: I don't want to get into how poorly managed they were but now My bone it.

48
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:27,202
Rym: basically I'll probably just get a much bigger bonus because I've been working late And I kind of need that for a down payment on a house.

49
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,509
Rym: So it's about the right time.

50
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:32,389
Scott: Yeah, I my pay does not change based on how many hours I work.

51
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:38,332
Scott: So I just work and I you know, I get all the work I need to get done on time and actually that's it You know.

52
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,643
Rym: one cool thing about when I worked at that hospital is it?

53
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:52,556
Rym: I was a salaried employee But I still logged my hours and the way they handled overtime Was that you had to work thirty seven and a half hours a week and that was really the only Requirement as far as like payroll.

54
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:56,110
Rym: and all those people were concerned and a lot of people worked a lot of extra hours.

55
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,045
Rym: A lot of them didn't log the hours because their bosses told him not to.

56
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,030
Rym: but that's just cuz they were dumb.

57
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:06,290
Scott: But I would log ever if there was our logging which never has been for me.

58
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,099
Rym: I don't think it was the dumbest thing because they they do this.

59
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:10,544
Rym: they'd like log.

60
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,470
Rym: they'd work hours that they didn't log.

61
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:18,228
Rym: But then their boss would let them take like a week off which was more vacation time than they'd get.

62
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:20,240
Rym: just had to do it Like kind of secretly.

63
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:21,370
Scott: Oh, that's how they were.

64
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:30,844
Rym: Basically everyone in the company did all these like secret deals with their bosses to like hey Can I just work late tonight and then skip Monday and Tuesday?

65
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:31,808
Scott: I wish I could do that.

66
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:32,510
Scott: That'd be awesome.

67
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:33,808
Scott: I'd go for that a lot.

68
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,483
Rym: There were a few people who worked the four ten hour days a week.

69
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,490
Scott: if I if I was a boss of people.

70
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:45,233
Scott: Basically, I wouldn't care if people showed up at the office unless there was a meeting at the office They had to be at.

71
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:47,161
Scott: I wouldn't care if people stayed home.

72
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:52,812
Scott: All I would care is this is the work it needs to be done on this time and That's it.

73
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:55,401
Scott: If that happens you can do whatever you want.

74
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,545
Rym: many a lot of jobs.

75
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:56,685
Rym: you.

76
00:05:56,725 --> 00:06:02,350
Rym: there's concurrent work with other people So you really got to have people around at the same time or else the works not gonna get done.

77
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:12,576
Rym: And if it's if you don't get the work done Do that because then you're leaving it All right, so you and me are on a project and we got to get it done and you're like, yeah Let's work all day Monday and finish it.

78
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:13,880
Rym: I'm like, fuck you.

79
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:16,470
Rym: I'm working Friday and then we don't get anything done.

80
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,515
Rym: We won't get fired great.

81
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:19,885
Scott: Yeah, that that was our fault for being dumbass.

82
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:20,990
Scott: isn't not working together?

83
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:25,304
Scott: Nah, nah, but that way if some it would be apparent very very quickly.

84
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:31,890
Scott: if someone was not capable of working You know freely and awesomely and if someone isn't that's not the kind of person I want working for me.

85
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:44,050
Scott: Honestly, I kind of like having the schedule now at least just because I commute on the train People who needed to work together would use you know technology to schedule the times they needed to be together.

86
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:51,690
Rym: No Because that member at college that never worked unless the professor set it up had no one ever worked together properly on things.

87
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:52,779
Scott: Oh, we did.

88
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:53,949
Rym: You're the only ones.

89
00:06:55,374 --> 00:07:03,966
Rym: I don't think I ever in the history of my time at RIT had a meeting with a group for a class whereupon Everyone in the group showed up.

90
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,635
Rym: I've never Once it happened.

91
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:18,525
Scott: there have been groups that I have been in where there were people not showing up But at least one or two other people always showed up and I have had groups that were like the perfect best groups where everyone Showed up and was awesome all the time.

92
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:20,169
Scott: Most of you I guess you know.

93
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:31,110
Scott: But the best group actually was when I took the XML not the XML class the ad hoc networking class Because it was basically me a guy I was in a group with before who was awesome and two graduate students who were awesome.

94
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:33,990
Scott: It was just four awesome people, you know, cuz I'm awesome.

95
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,733
Scott: Also see the.

96
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:38,390
Rym: I guess the problem I had in IT was that the one time I was in a really awesome group.

97
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:43,209
Rym: Everyone was so awesome that no one wanted to do the work because it was boring work.

98
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:47,930
Scott: Oh, see we you know, this is a high-level CS class of you know, hard awesome work.

99
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:50,462
Rym: Yeah And that class only the last couple labs were high-level.

100
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:56,750
Rym: the first couple labs were like Here is how to deal with like running cables through walls and cut and dry wall.

101
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,110
Scott: This wasn't a. this is wasn't a situation of labs.

102
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,930
Scott: This is a situation of the whole class is one project.

103
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:07,890
Scott: You basically spend the entire quarter making it and every single week you have to present where you're at and such.

104
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:14,030
Scott: So, you know, I basically did all the front heavy work and then went ah for the rest of the quarter.

105
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,736
Scott: Well, everyone else did the top heavy.

106
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:17,463
Rym: But anyway, you do make a good point.

107
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:19,290
Rym: Remember those days?

108
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:23,603
Rym: Yeah, what about days in those summers where we lived at RIT?

109
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:24,586
Rym: We had nothing to do.

110
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:28,820
Rym: No responsibilities You had like one like summer half.

111
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,501
Scott: I had class I had the the the third But they basically be the calculus three.

112
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,095
Scott: Yeah calculus three for the third time Three by three.

113
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:42,929
Scott: Yeah, see I took calculus in high school.

114
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,810
Scott: So when I got to RIT, they made me take calculus one two and three.

115
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,934
Scott: So the calculus one.

116
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:51,210
Scott: it was so laughably easy because I had already taken calculus in high school.

117
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:57,004
Scott: That was like they give me problems like, you know derived the old way and I'm like, I already know You know annex to the n-1.

118
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:01,504
Scott: I can't even my brain won't even do it the old way anymore because I know the new way.

119
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,010
Scott: this isn't gonna happen.

120
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,748
Scott: but I got like, you know an a and then it was calculus 2 which was like.

121
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,871
Scott: But ti 89 was able to pull me through calculus 2 and then calculus 3.

122
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:17,589
Scott: I just didn't understand what they were saying And I didn't understand what they were saying again.

123
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:28,055
Scott: And then I took it in the summer and I got to see which was you know, good enough to graduate Outstanding and I got the same degree that someone who got much better grades got and probably a better.

124
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:34,750
Rym: I at least had the requirement of if I didn't maintain a 3.4 one IBM would never have hired me because they required a 3.4.

125
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,730
Scott: Well, I already yeah, I already knew that I did not care to work at any place.

126
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,170
Scott: You know The only places that look at the GPA and stuff and actually cared are big companies.

127
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:45,251
Scott: Like if I wanted to work at Intel, yeah But I.

128
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:50,830
Rym: yeah, I only work at big companies because more and more I work in a company IT for small companies.

129
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,818
Rym: It's not fun and doesn't pay.

130
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,543
Rym: well and you it you're.

131
00:09:55,583 --> 00:10:00,157
Rym: I mean if you're the IT guy for a small company They're not hiring more IT guys.

132
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:01,982
Rym: You're it you're on call.

133
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:04,690
Rym: You're the only one never go on vacation.

134
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,225
Scott: I guess if I was it and it's I guess if I was IT I would like to work at the bigger company because that's what the big iron is.

135
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:12,696
Scott: but being CS It's better to work at the small company.

136
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:23,236
Scott: Everyone's just chillin chillin hanging out having a good time Relax, no big faceless, you know Policies and things getting in the way Just do it.

137
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:24,422
Scott: However, it's supposed to be done.

138
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,834
Rym: And yeah, I definitely agree Of course now I get.

139
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:32,278
Rym: I get the benefits of both because there's only like a hundred people in my company But everything is run like it's a big company.

140
00:10:32,338 --> 00:10:36,170
Rym: So we still have all the like enterprise stuff, but there's only a hundred people.

141
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:37,860
Scott: Yeah, we just bought and things are getting.

142
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:41,938
Scott: you know, they're slowly getting weird but we're seeing how we can do.

143
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:50,668
Scott: and you know, the boss who used to be you know, the Tech partner is now the New York tech manager and he's he's looking out for us.

144
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:51,130
Scott: He's all good.

145
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,464
Scott: So as long as we have the defenses up, well, we'll be alright.

146
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:59,444
Rym: So anyway Tonight we decided you know, it's Thursday and remember way back.

147
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:00,770
Rym: We said we were taking Thursday shows.

148
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,677
Rym: We're just gonna change it up go crazy.

149
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:05,005
Rym: We're gonna do all the cool weird stuff on Thursdays.

150
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:10,057
Rym: We're gonna break format and Yeah, Thursdays ended up being two newses.

151
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:14,590
Rym: We didn't care about and then a main bit that usually devolved into well what we just did.

152
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:28,975
Scott: Yeah, well, I think you know, the problem is we just when you have a you know People talk about creativity, right and it's like when you have some sort of focus or limit on your creativity It's much easier to come up with something.

153
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:32,526
Scott: For example, if someone says, you know come up with a cool video.

154
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:46,937
Scott: It's like uh But if someone says come up with a funny video game video It's like huh, you can actually you have something to build off of it actually can think and I think Thursday in Thursday it was not a do.

155
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:51,530
Scott: this Thursday was a. don't do tech don't do video games don't do anime don't do comic.

156
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:53,297
Scott: So and don't do science.

157
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:58,916
Rym: and I remember for the longest time it was either we did a food show Yeah, or we talked about a movie We just watch.

158
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:00,270
Scott: so it's very very difficult.

159
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:08,173
Scott: even when we decided to you know in throwing away the format of Thursday made it even harder to come up because now we even Have less direction.

160
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:09,317
Rym: So we did.

161
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:13,089
Rym: the best we could come up with is I think every Thursday.

162
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:13,711
Rym: now This isn't.

163
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:14,053
Rym: I mean.

164
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:20,029
Rym: the reason we're not doing this stuff in the experimental feed is because the experimental feed is going to be reserved For the really out there stuff.

165
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:26,330
Scott: Yeah, basically we came but we've always had a bajillion ideas the experimental feed and never done them because we don't have time for that.

166
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,573
Rym: Shit, but we're getting there.

167
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:34,574
Rym: I've actually got I've got several things recorded that eventually there's gonna be regular content in there and You know, I'm.

168
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:39,930
Scott: as soon as this website is ready our ability to do more crazy shit will be greatly enhanced.

169
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,065
Rym: But and shit just got real.

170
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:42,810
Scott: it got real.

171
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:45,045
Scott: You should see some of the features that are.

172
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:45,630
Scott: at first.

173
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,610
Scott: It's the website's pretty much just gonna just list the episodes and link to the mp3s and that sort of thing.

174
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:56,184
Scott: But you'll see it's features will slowly grow on to it like a like a like barnacles.

175
00:12:56,364 --> 00:12:58,490
Scott: only good because barnacles are not so good.

176
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,298
Scott: Sometimes they are are they really?

177
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:00,860
Scott: Oh never.

178
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:03,030
Scott: No, I mean even if you're a whale you want some armor.

179
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,423
Rym: Probably not whale armor whale armor.

180
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:09,010
Rym: Yeah, how about a giant whale?

181
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,213
Scott: What do you?

182
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:11,718
Scott: all whales are giant.

183
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,364
Rym: now, I don't think you understand how giant.

184
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:16,697
Rym: the one that went to the moon was very large Back down the map.

185
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:18,109
Scott: It was how did he get there?

186
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,721
Rym: It was bigger than the city on the map by far.

187
00:13:22,022 --> 00:13:23,990
Rym: It was like the size of four city squares.

188
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,782
Rym: The big whale take it to the moon.

189
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:33,048
Scott: Yeah, but it's not armor.

190
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:37,108
Scott: You Need the paladin anyway.

191
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:39,901
Rym: So we decided for now.

192
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:44,769
Scott: what we're gonna do with Thursday is For now meaning for today and we'll see what happens.

193
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,018
Rym: Well now for now in the general sense, there's two.

194
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:48,103
Rym: there's two for now's.

195
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:49,950
Rym: for now number one general sense.

196
00:13:50,553 --> 00:14:00,690
Rym: Thursday we're going to try out formats of the show and Bits and all those things because we got a lot of bits that we never really incorporated into the show.

197
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:05,710
Scott: We're still gonna talk about books too on Thursdays.

198
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:12,154
Rym: yeah, yeah, but pretty much I think the best way to go forward with Thursday is to Everything like we have.

199
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:24,215
Rym: we can have a multitude of formats because right now GeekNights says the one format, you know news news thing of the day main vid Thursday can be a different format like every time to match the content of Whatever.

200
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,225
Rym: we're talking about that.

201
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:34,201
Scott: Thursday Yeah, and we'll probably steal things from other shows and try to remix them and combine them and some people might notice us stealing and Some people might not.

202
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:43,462
Scott: and you know maybe we'll try to come up with new stuff and mix it with the stolen stuff and and formats that work will then be a retconned into Monday Tuesday Wednesday show.

203
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:44,630
Scott: Yeah, we'll try to party.

204
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,009
Scott: We'll try to be like the Japanese steal ever steal everyone's ideas and then make them ten times better.

205
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:53,750
Rym: Isn't the old strategy to steal from the Forgotten Masters exactly?

206
00:14:56,172 --> 00:15:04,050
Scott: Gonna steal from someone steal from the Forgotten Masters Because then it appears as you're great as a master, but no one knows you're stealing.

207
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:14,514
Rym: But anyway the for now of right now is whenever we can't come up with a topic for a Thursday Then what?

208
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:15,578
Rym: basically these two things?

209
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:25,887
Rym: if we can't come up with a format for a Thursday Then what we're gonna do is just like pick a topic and force it and if we can't come up with a topic We're gonna pick a format and force it.

210
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:28,720
Rym: so tonight we couldn't come up with a topic.

211
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:35,443
Rym: so we decided to force a format and The crab people I came up with was I'll have a topic.

212
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:36,627
Scott: people know what crab people is.

213
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:37,290
Scott: We keep saying it.

214
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:38,815
Rym: I don't think we should tell them.

215
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:40,100
Rym: All right, or should we?

216
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,108
Scott: I know if you don't know what crab people is.

217
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:43,438
Rym: You're not cool It's a crab people.

218
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:44,104
Rym: It's now.

219
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:44,366
Rym: Yeah.

220
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:48,487
Rym: All right So I guess you could have crab people II then it could be an adjective people.

221
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:52,787
Scott: I people I multi-pass.

222
00:15:53,593 --> 00:15:58,974
Rym: Yeah, quite really Honestly, yeah, really?

223
00:15:59,195 --> 00:15:59,476
Rym: Okay.

224
00:16:00,038 --> 00:16:05,555
Rym: Well, there were like nine jokes and okay anyway, so Scott's got a topic.

225
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,730
Rym: I've got a topic and inadvertently we didn't tell each other what the topics are.

226
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:18,998
Rym: So one if the topics end up being the same topic I don't know what we'll do because I can't imagine that being the case All right, but I don't know.

227
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,564
Rym: should we flip a coin?

228
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,129
Rym: I got a C a d6 over there.

229
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:23,634
Scott: I rolled roll your d6.

230
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:26,442
Scott: All right, I got evens means you go first.

231
00:16:26,563 --> 00:16:27,586
Rym: evens mean I go first.

232
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:27,887
Rym: Yeah.

233
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:28,729
Rym: All right, here we go.

234
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:30,375
Scott: You could be lying.

235
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:31,138
Rym: It's a one.

236
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,383
Scott: No, it's not good.

237
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:33,226
Scott: I could roll again.

238
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:35,277
Scott: I Don't know then.

239
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:40,362
Scott: What's the point of even rolling if it's just We're not gonna obey the dice.

240
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:41,430
Scott: what's the point of using it?

241
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:52,380
Rym: That's always been the way I flip coins whenever I need to make a decision that I flip a coin for And I urge anyone who has to flip coins when you're not playing a German board game To use this method.

242
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,740
Rym: I say with me you're not playing a German board game Because if you're playing a German board game, you're flipping a coin.

243
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,466
Rym: It should actually be random.

244
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:00,173
Rym: if it's not random Don't flip a coin.

245
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:13,929
Rym: But anyway, if you're gonna flip a coin to figure out what to do flip the coin and if you immediately in any way balk at the result choose the Opposite answer from what you flipped and don't look back.

246
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:16,099
Scott: Yeah, cuz that means you know, it's like.

247
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:19,630
Scott: it's like if you're flipping a coin It's because you don't know what you want.

248
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:29,957
Scott: But if you flip the coin and you get a result and you feel like you don't want that like you're like I don't want to do what the coin said then do the other thing, you know Just don't then just do.

249
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:32,230
Scott: the other thing is obviously you didn't like the one you got.

250
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,595
Scott: Yes, but don't lie to yourself.

251
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,704
Rym: Don't be angry with or for the coin.

252
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,050
Rym: Just just go with the opposite.

253
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:43,430
Rym: Yeah, you don't have to do whatever the coin tells you to do As long as you promise to protect both children and coins.

254
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:44,753
Rym: Okay.

255
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:46,801
Rym: Okay enough of this cavalcade crap.

256
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:47,464
Rym: Let's go.

257
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,870
Scott: I guess they're barking and you're going first.

258
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,923
Rym: Well, I assume you're not talking about Martin Martin Luther King jr.

259
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:55,365
Rym: Estate.

260
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:57,717
Scott: no, okay Is that what you're talking about?

261
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:58,946
Scott: I'm talking about really?

262
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:01,832
Scott: Yeah Cuz it came up What.

263
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:04,560
Scott: well, there's one thing I know about Martin Luther King jr.

264
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:06,125
Scott: Estate and that is his wife.

265
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:18,483
Scott: Coretta Scott King died Relatively recently like months maybe a year something to go due to Randy BS due to well do Well, yes, she had cancer and she could have easily.

266
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:21,454
Scott: I mean, you know, there's no cure for cancer There's no magic.

267
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:36,910
Scott: cancer goes away and you survive right but many many people Survive all types of cancer because they go and get chemotherapy and radiation therapy and all sorts of other Painful medicines in hospitals that she could have easily gotten just by going to a hospital.

268
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:39,770
Scott: You know, she's Coretta Scott King Martin Luther King's wife.

269
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:40,795
Scott: She could have gotten them.

270
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:41,600
Scott: that do you know?

271
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,472
Scott: she even if she didn't have the money which you know Obviously she had the money and she could have gotten the money easily Right.

272
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:53,749
Scott: She could have been you know, good chance of survival not like a guarantee but good chance very good chance.

273
00:18:53,849 --> 00:19:05,038
Scott: instead She decided to go to Mexico to see some Randy bullshit clinic not real medicine doctor and she died To no one's surprise.

274
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,990
Scott: who knew that she was going to get fake medicine?

275
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,230
Rym: Yeah, but that's not what I'm gonna talk about.

276
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:15,855
Scott: Okay, because I guess if she hadn't done that with the question of the estate even be a question right now She'd probably still be alive.

277
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:19,170
Rym: Uh, I don't the thing I'm gonna talk about.

278
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,269
Rym: I don't think you know the the fullness of the state of the state of Martin Luther King.

279
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:24,349
Rym: jr.

280
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:26,119
Scott: I'd know I did not.

281
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,964
Scott: I know nothing of this.

282
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:28,372
Scott: I didn't even see it on Google News Really?

283
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:31,003
Rym: This is one of those things is gonna make you really really angry.

284
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:34,281
Rym: But anyway, because I rolled a one Alright, I guess you have to go first.

285
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:35,510
Scott: Well, I know we're talking about.

286
00:19:36,572 --> 00:19:38,036
Rym: That was simply a preview.

287
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:40,684
Scott: Oh, well, I was just gonna talk about how Rym is stupid.

288
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,188
Rym: All right, go for it.

289
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:44,178
Rym: No, that's I'm waiting.

290
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:51,290
Scott: No, I basically copped out and You know, I was gonna write a long post in the forum that I stopped earlier.

291
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,065
Scott: So I said aha what an easy way to do that - what a way to foot.

292
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:56,972
Scott: what an easy way to fill up The show.

293
00:19:56,992 --> 00:20:01,350
Rym: Wait, did you write like a quarter of the post in the forum and then close the window or the tab?

294
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:07,990
Scott: No, I did a okay cuz I don't like two paragraphs and then ctrl-a and pushback space and then close the tab.

295
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:12,798
Scott: See, I usually close the tab when I balk But basically I just said hey, you know what?

296
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:14,464
Scott: Uh, cuz that was so easy.

297
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:15,930
Scott: I've already thought of two paragraphs.

298
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,123
Scott: I'll save it for right now.

299
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:18,654
Scott: What you know?

300
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:19,617
Scott: nice cop-out.

301
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:22,850
Scott: basically what I was gonna talk about is cuz you know, people were talking about this.

302
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:28,630
Scott: You know, there was the regular old bailout of the the mortgage companies and the banks, right?

303
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:33,196
Scott: And now they're talking about, you know bailing out the auto companies.

304
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:43,746
Rym: and there was I in the state of California, which really you realize the state of California's Current deficit is now more than the GNP of more than a hundred countries.

305
00:20:44,248 --> 00:20:48,810
Scott: Whoa, and You know New York State actually just said, you know what?

306
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:57,490
Scott: We're gonna have to cut back the spending because we don't have any money which is the first Thing I've seen about cutting back spending as opposed to you know, getting more fake money.

307
00:20:57,975 --> 00:20:58,703
Rym: First thing you do.

308
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:05,137
Scott: Yeah Back the spending on education and Well, it depends.

309
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:07,970
Rym: I mean you cut back spending unless that's not an option.

310
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:15,739
Rym: I mean if your choice is either run at a deficit or stop sending kids to school You should probably run at the deficit.

311
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,419
Scott: or you know, no, but yeah, but they're not not sending kids to school They're just make getting schools less money.

312
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:30,917
Rym: So no new textbooks this year, you know, that sort of thing I went to like one of the richest schools in Michigan outside of the fancy boarding schools and we still had like Nine-year-old textbooks beating the hell out.

313
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:31,559
Scott: Yeah, me too.

314
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:34,950
Scott: I went to you know, relatively, you know, big-money high school.

315
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,950
Scott: I mean it was in the wealthiest County in the wealthiest state in the entire in the wealthiest country in the world.

316
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:42,855
Scott: You know wasn't the wealthiest town But it was a wealthy town.

317
00:21:42,975 --> 00:21:54,210
Rym: man talk about silver spoons because I went I lived in like the fourth or fifth Wealthiest suburb in the country and that's per capita though You know, they're like you can like places like Beverly Hills have mad monies.

318
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:58,068
Scott: But then there's still like Monaco where there's also a lot really really low money.

319
00:21:58,088 --> 00:22:03,687
Scott: Yeah We'll have to compare the Fairfield County, Connecticut is just you know average big monies all around.

320
00:22:03,807 --> 00:22:04,550
Scott: no low monies.

321
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,101
Rym: We'll have to compare the gross to the per capita.

322
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:09,230
Scott: and then there's a small area in Westport, Connecticut.

323
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,695
Scott: That's just huge monies.

324
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:11,457
Scott: like famous people.

325
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:14,848
Rym: I lived in the Mushroom Ring of Prosperity around the decaying center.

326
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:15,530
Rym: That is Detroit.

327
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:25,861
Scott: Yeah, yeah But anyway, so the whole the main thing that's going on right now is the question of you know Bailing out the auto companies Ford GM mostly those two right.

328
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:28,950
Scott: and the situation is this see these really big companies.

329
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:39,150
Scott: right, the big companies are ran are run incredibly inefficiently are incredibly stupidly and They're losing money, you know, and they have cash right in their wallets.

330
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:46,943
Scott: But their wallets are slowly emptying and in a certain number of months their wallets will be empty Unlike say Google or Microsoft who have giant wallets that are not emptying.

331
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:50,657
Scott: So even if they start being unprofitable They're gonna be around for a long time.

332
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,149
Scott: The car companies might just run out of money.

333
00:22:53,812 --> 00:23:01,624
Scott: Yeah, and if you look the US already we have you know The airplane companies and Amtrak and them and most of the X.

334
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:04,229
Rym: not a good example, but for a lot of reasons I don't get into it.

335
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,075
Scott: The point is is you have one Amtrak.

336
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:24,650
Scott: the point is and that is that whether you support them or not the you have these Transportation related companies where if the government just didn't give them a bunch of tax money all the time They're incredibly unprofitable and inefficient and would go out of business and all those people wouldn't have jobs and it would be the end.

337
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,936
Rym: Yep, now but at least in the case with the transportation things they provide it's kind of like the government is subsidizing this service.

338
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:36,943
Rym: that is at least in the government's eyes or Possibly the lobbyists eyes a net boon to society.

339
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:40,804
Rym: in a bit of perfect world Amtrak and failing airlines are at least a boon to.

340
00:23:40,944 --> 00:23:46,890
Scott: I think you know Ideally right as people always talk about, you know, the old socialism capitalism divide, right?

341
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:57,290
Scott: And it's I think the way you have to handle it Which is something that is pretty obvious and just people don't say it often even though smart people all know it Is that there are some things out there?

342
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:19,012
Scott: there are some services which there's no reason to profit from them either because a It's a necessary thing that is impossible to profit from you know, because it's just a losing deal be because it's something where you if the influences of you know profit invaded into that service.

343
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:29,717
Scott: it would you know provide a you know a Negative effect on society as a whole, you know things like, you know medicines and you know transportation You know public transit and things like that.

344
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:36,300
Scott: Really having those things be for-profit private companies is not is not gonna work out.

345
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,472
Rym: Yeah, kind of like for-profit prisons.

346
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:48,207
Rym: bad idea Exactly exactly, but the point I was just trying to make is that at least with like the airlines and you know These sorts of things Amtrak.

347
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,560
Rym: It's a direct boon to society.

348
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,092
Rym: It's a direct boon to the people that's being subsidized.

349
00:24:53,133 --> 00:25:11,860
Rym: but with the auto industry It's like this indirect boon because the old the boon to society is primarily that Towns and cities that otherwise do not have any sort of enough jobs to maintain themselves Have jobs like cities exist because these auto companies exist to create jobs.

350
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:16,300
Rym: But it's like this indirect thing because we're creating them through this for-profit enterprise.

351
00:25:17,004 --> 00:25:20,180
Rym: And then the boon is the secondary effect as opposed to the primary effects.

352
00:25:20,501 --> 00:25:26,720
Scott: Yep, you know cuz like, you know if we pay money to keep say, you know American Airlines in business, right?

353
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:27,563
Scott: What does that mean?

354
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:31,576
Scott: Well, it means that American people can get from here to there, you know quickly.

355
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:34,969
Scott: if we didn't do that You wouldn't be able to get everywhere.

356
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:37,340
Scott: You'd only be able to get to the profitable cities.

357
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:38,849
Scott: You wouldn't be able to fly to.

358
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,480
Scott: you know, North Dakota, you know.

359
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:50,257
Scott: But now because you know the government subsidizes these airlines you can fly to North Dakota Which is I guess useful for some people especially those who live in North Dakota, even though it doesn't exist.

360
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:50,900
Scott: and they don't exist.

361
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,511
Rym: But that's been a thing with Scott for a long time.

362
00:25:54,532 --> 00:25:55,234
Scott: I've never been there.

363
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,600
Scott: I've never met anyone who is from there.

364
00:25:57,165 --> 00:26:02,870
Scott: We met people at RIT were from there Someone who said they had a friend who is from there.

365
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,315
Scott: That's not good enough for me.

366
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:05,719
Rym: Okay, do we have to go there?

367
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:06,883
Scott: Why not?

368
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:10,263
Rym: Cuz I mean I remember Iteration.

369
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:22,952
Scott: I bet we'll just drive north from South Dakota We'll enter Canada and you'll be like see Scott we went through North Dakota and I'm like, aha sure remember that Plan alpha of desert bus involved going through North Dakota.

370
00:26:23,253 --> 00:26:23,514
Scott: Yeah.

371
00:26:23,694 --> 00:26:33,025
Scott: Yeah anyway, so You know with the subsidizing the airlines you get that sort of thing where now we can you know have Transportation for people in North Dakota.

372
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:36,756
Scott: We did not have before subsidizing the airlines and the auto companies.

373
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:41,700
Scott: All that does is You know keep all these people in their jobs.

374
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:58,365
Scott: There's no other reason to keep you know subsidizing auto companies other than these people won't have any jobs because we can get cars from Japanese companies European companies or Even other American companies that are not, you know, we can get that are not Ford or GM, you know There there's at least one other.

375
00:26:58,465 --> 00:26:59,811
Rym: well, but there's all it's.

376
00:27:00,293 --> 00:27:11,717
Rym: it's really difficult to talk about companies in that sense because the auto industry is really really incestuous a lot more than people realize and Companies make engines for each other and there's all sorts of overlap.

377
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:11,998
Rym: Yeah.

378
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:20,400
Scott: Yeah I mean you go to go to the actual Ford website like the Universal Ford website and you'll see all the logos of all the different things that are actually forward.

379
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:24,160
Scott: Aston Martin is actually Ford Mazda's actually Ford.

380
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:35,795
Scott: it's like there's a whole bunch of things that are actually Ford besides Ford and basically everything else is GM, but So it's not a problem with us not having enough cars.

381
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:37,120
Scott: There are plenty of cars.

382
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,620
Scott: We don't really need more except for you know, people like to buy new ones, but there's you know the demand for cars.

383
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:53,840
Rym: Yeah, I can't think of one possible Boon indirectly for creating these cars by hat by making sure that there are a lot of domestic cars available.

384
00:27:54,482 --> 00:28:09,280
Rym: It drives the price of foreign cars down because if there were only foreign cars and a limited number of domestic cars Then over time the price of cars would go up because there's no competition internally and there's no incentive for foreign companies to offer lower prices.

385
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:10,409
Scott: That's true.

386
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:11,014
Scott: That's true.

387
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:13,886
Scott: But that's Such an indirect.

388
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:32,172
Scott: the other thing is that the foreign companies, you know would end up still competing with each other for you know The because the supply of cars might fall under the demand and then you would have these, you know They would all compete over, you know by the you know, the French car no by the Japanese car No by the you know, whatever car that you know.

389
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,740
Scott: that competition would drive the prices down.

390
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,860
Rym: But I guess I would argue that having the domestic mark the domestic production at least stabilizes car prices.

391
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:48,560
Rym: Yeah, it's in in a short-term way Yeah, I think yeah, but I think that's what stabilizing does it makes things less prone to change in the short term exactly.

392
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:50,246
Scott: So the thing is.

393
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:56,352
Scott: the major problem here is I actually on the one hand I say man We should just let those car companies go out of business.

394
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:57,980
Scott: They were poorly managed, right?

395
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:00,466
Scott: They were spending their money like stupid.

396
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:02,292
Scott: they you know, we're not.

397
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:04,940
Scott: you know driving up demand for cars.

398
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:10,819
Scott: You know spending way too much money in advertising not enough on making newer better cars building a whole bunch of SUVs.

399
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:21,628
Scott: You know, they I point out something really sad that I learned they did right, you know ever since Roger Rabbit way back in the day It's just been bad for no Something really bad today.

400
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:27,186
Rym: remember when gas prices were going up and up and up and like SUV sales Collapsed and they lost money on the SUVs.

401
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:29,814
Rym: Yeah SUV sales are way up.

402
00:29:29,914 --> 00:29:31,338
Rym: Now the gas prices are back down.

403
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:39,360
Rym: Yeah I think the FARC headline was as more proof that people never learn from their mistakes and never look to the past for guidance.

404
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:43,920
Scott: Yeah, yeah, I still understand why people buy SUVs, but that's not what I'm talking about.

405
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:50,020
Scott: So on, you know going by that I feel like we should let these companies go out of business.

406
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:54,460
Scott: They're not a company like, you know Amtrak where or American Airlines.

407
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,099
Scott: So they provide where they're providing something that is can't be profitable, but it's sort of necessary infrastructure in a way.

408
00:30:02,707 --> 00:30:16,171
Scott: But But It's not because I didn't want to say but They're not providing any a necessary infrastructure kind of thing.

409
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:24,528
Scott: And if they went out of business, they're just wouldn't be nude GM cars, they wouldn't you know, but By letting them go in the wrong place.

410
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:27,260
Scott: Yes, but by letting them go out of business, right?

411
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:32,054
Scott: All of these unskilled laborers will lose their jobs not just unskilled.

412
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:33,939
Rym: there are a lot of highly skilled laborers, too.

413
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:36,089
Scott: Yes, the thing is right is that you don't?

414
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,360
Scott: it's it's like if we let the companies go out of business.

415
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:40,467
Scott: You don't feel bad for the highly skilled laborers.

416
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:44,160
Scott: They would get new jobs, you know, well the executives could get new jobs.

417
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,862
Scott: It depends.

418
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:46,770
Rym: the executives are not highly trained labor.

419
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,271
Rym: Most of them.

420
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:48,777
Scott: No, no, no, but it's like.

421
00:30:48,817 --> 00:30:56,602
Scott: but like you Don't have a choice of like, you know, cuz the reason the company's doing bad is not because of the factory workers It's because.

422
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:57,666
Scott: well who may

423
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:22,180
Rym: well part of the problem why the American car companies are doing so poorly is because of the workers but again indirectly because of the benefits that were paid and Promised due to the unions back when the car industry was very profitable are still liabilities today and pensions and health care And things are so much higher for American car companies and other car companies, which I'm not arguing against.

424
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:23,396
Rym: I'm saying that's kind of how it is.

425
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:26,900
Rym: That is one of the primary reasons they're having so much trouble.

426
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:28,525
Scott: Well, here's the thing right.

427
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:38,043
Scott: and when the economy is bad the companies, you know in bargaining with unions Should have a lot more power and they should be able to just say look pensions are gone You're screwed.

428
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:41,720
Scott: now either you do what we say or you're gonna have no jobs in this bad economy.

429
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:47,300
Rym: Screwing the pensions only hurts all the old people who were promised the pensions and that's how they're retiring.

430
00:31:47,661 --> 00:31:53,640
Scott: Yeah, but you know, but either either hey, you know, we screw the pensions and they can't retire on that.

431
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:57,260
Scott: But you know now, okay, so I get your social security.

432
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,188
Scott: Well, no the other doing it.

433
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:06,546
Scott: the way we're doing it is basically saying here you can have your pension But now we're gonna tax it all the way from you to give the money back to your company So it stays in business.

434
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:08,660
Rym: Well, no because the the tax is funding.

435
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,533
Rym: This would be coming from you and me not from the people living in Detroit.

436
00:32:12,316 --> 00:32:13,120
Scott: Yeah, that's real fair.

437
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,183
Rym: We are paying for that.

438
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:22,818
Rym: It's got we and by we I mean people living in like New York and Major urban centers and the quote-unquote blue states.

439
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:25,480
Rym: now I'm not trying to make a value judgment here by any stretch.

440
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:36,140
Rym: But we basically fund the existence of many places in the rest of the country And I'm fine with that for a lot of historical and societal reasons, but that's kind of how it is.

441
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,806
Rym: Anyway, so how is this any different?

442
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:41,479
Rym: Well the thing here, I guess it's different because Michigan's a blue state.

443
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:54,325
Scott: the thing is right is We're entering a situation where what do we do about the fact that there is you know in a world where we don't yet Have in a world.

444
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:57,859
Scott: Yes, we we all know we all know that someday, right?

445
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:04,840
Scott: We'll invent some sort of nanotechnology diamond age type replicator technology and even people who don't want to work.

446
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:17,375
Scott: We're able to live at some subsisting level doing absolutely nothing and you know, they'll be able to eat and have some sort of protective shelter and clothing and Then you know the the people who want to do things will do things.

447
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:34,200
Scott: people don't want to do anything Just won't do anything and we'll just get the bare minimum that is provided for effectively no cost by technology however, we are not yet at that point, but We are approaching a situation where there is less demand for unskilled labor in the world.

448
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:43,040
Scott: Then there is a supply and the only way people have of making a living in this world of you know Getting anything beyond nothing is with their labor.

449
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,708
Scott: That's all someone has is you know, their skills their work.

450
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:49,679
Scott: and if there is no demand for work, then what are people gonna do?

451
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:52,911
Scott: To just get food and a shelter?

452
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:54,640
Scott: if their work is worth nothing?

453
00:33:55,202 --> 00:34:09,292
Scott: Now then we don't yet have a technological solution that lets them live You know at a minimum level for free and they have nothing that anyone wants from them and there's nothing they can do now Even if we skip over that part.

454
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:12,697
Rym: and you know The kind of longer-term scenario even in the short term.

455
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:22,190
Rym: Feel bad for the engineers and the highly skilled workers too in these situations because it's coal miner syndrome where I'm a coal miner I work in the coal mine in the coal mining town.

456
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:31,105
Rym: if the coal mine closes I Have to leave because there is no other coal mine for me to work in and coal mining is my skill The engineer.

457
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:33,315
Scott: I think a problem today is a lot of people refuse to leave.

458
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:33,998
Scott: they just sit there.

459
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:45,913
Rym: But at the same time if you have a family, it's I mean the way America is it is very very difficult if you do not have a lot of money or If you have a family to just pick up and leave.

460
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:47,219
Rym: it takes a long time.

461
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:48,766
Rym: It takes a long time to sell a house.

462
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,274
Rym: takes a long time to buy a house.

463
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,804
Rym: if you pull kids out of school That's usually not good for them.

464
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:54,190
Rym: You know during a year or something.

465
00:34:54,532 --> 00:34:56,280
Rym: It's difficult to put down roots in a new place.

466
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,220
Rym: It's difficult to get a job somewhere else.

467
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:06,648
Rym: I mean if you lost your job You probably don't have that much money to go flying around all the different cities going to job interviews That aren't even guaranteed.

468
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:18,210
Rym: new jobs like giving phone interviews Yeah But no company does that with the and not that many nice companies will fly you out for a job interview and also all the places That have jobs like New York.

469
00:35:18,572 --> 00:35:19,640
Rym: You can't afford a house.

470
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:23,553
Rym: You're gonna have to live way way outside and commute like crazy, and it's not.

471
00:35:23,974 --> 00:35:24,897
Rym: it's a bad situation.

472
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:31,040
Rym: get some roommates Yeah, but if you have live someplace crappy yeah, but if you have a large family that makes it even more difficult.

473
00:35:31,343 --> 00:35:32,837
Scott: Yeah, well you know you've.

474
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:39,994
Scott: well There's you know that's a separate issue that we keep discussing of people having families that you know they but this situation I mean these are people who?

475
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,120
Rym: Could afford their family and we're doing well and head plan for the future.

476
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:51,337
Rym: But they've been slowly put into the situation where there is no easy way out where the planning was for.

477
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:55,328
Rym: not because Factors they have no control over fucked them that is true.

478
00:35:55,408 --> 00:35:55,809
Scott: However.

479
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:02,929
Scott: You know there are some factors in which you know for example I You know know how to program computers.

480
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,700
Rym: yes because you were born with a silver spoon.

481
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,620
Rym: To go to one of the most prestigious.

482
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:12,630
Scott: Let's say right nobody needs computer programmers.

483
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:17,791
Scott: every more someone writes a program that writes every program That's ever needed, and we don't need computer programmers anymore.

484
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:19,440
Scott: There are things I can do.

485
00:36:19,581 --> 00:36:23,240
Scott: I have other skills that I can sell that are worth something.

486
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:23,661
Scott: I you know.

487
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:29,460
Scott: I could get a different sort of job in some other industry that would be at a similar level.

488
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:45,928
Rym: However, I would argue that the main reason we have that luxury and the reason we have so many Skit like marketable skills outside of our primary skills is that we grew up in relatively affluent wealthy middle-class to offer middle-class Lifestyles are?

489
00:36:45,968 --> 00:36:47,220
Rym: we didn't have to work that much?

490
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,189
Rym: But if we're in we could skip.

491
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:51,983
Rym: we didn't have to work for most of our lives And when we did.

492
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:52,748
Rym: it was trivial work.

493
00:36:52,788 --> 00:36:54,740
Rym: we had a lot of time to pursue varied interests.

494
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:57,800
Rym: We went to universities which got us a lot of well-rounded skills.

495
00:36:58,562 --> 00:36:59,966
Scott: You're a coal miner right.

496
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:13,448
Scott: you may have not had an opportunity in your life to go to college and to learn all these things earlier In life, but if you were at a point in which you know you're a coal miner in a town and you coal mine But you're doing well you can afford your family.

497
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:14,511
Scott: You're doing okay.

498
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:15,915
Scott: You're responsible right now.

499
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:23,338
Scott: You could learn new things Right now if you didn't have you know the ambition to you know or or the forethought to say I?

500
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,713
Scott: Could learn something else just in case the coal mine goes under because you you know.

501
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:31,960
Scott: you know you're in a precarious Position even if the coal mines doing really well.

502
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:34,922
Scott: You know that if the coal mine goes away You're fucked.

503
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:43,115
Scott: so but at the same time knowing that as you're saying time while you're good You should do something to make sure that you know you're okay in the future.

504
00:37:43,316 --> 00:37:50,780
Rym: at the same time one If you're raising a family and working full-time you might not have the time to reasonably do that or at least not do it quickly.

505
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,940
Rym: I mean a lot of people probably saw the writing on the wall.

506
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:57,640
Scott: Hey, this isn't going so well, but you got to do something before the writing is on the wall.

507
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,450
Rym: Yes, but even then by like even the long-term like all right.

508
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,297
Rym: I see problems a decade down the road.

509
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:06,777
Rym: go to night school Yeah, but if you're also are taking care of the family life is hard.

510
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:16,492
Rym: Yeah, well see the other problem here is that if everyone affected by these economic troubles had done this then there still wouldn't be Enough jobs forever.

511
00:38:16,532 --> 00:38:17,020
Scott: That's true.

512
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:25,348
Rym: It only works because most of the people in these situations either can't or don't take advantage of these ideas.

513
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:28,048
Rym: if everyone did Everyone's right.

514
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:38,751
Scott: if every coal miner went to night school Then we'd have a million people who learned some valuable skill and thus the supply of that Particular skill would be high and the demand would be less than the supply.

515
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:43,759
Scott: and you know the people already getting paid to do whatever Those coal miners learned how to do would get paid less.

516
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:53,160
Rym: Anyway, and the whole thing would yeah, because we should try to wrap this up at least somewhat reasonably quickly I actually have what I think is a really good idea on how to deal with this situation.

517
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:54,161
Scott: Oh, dude I was

518
00:38:54,222 --> 00:39:04,672
Rym: inspired because you happen to pick a topic that I read a lot about in the last week Because earlier in the week I I found a Wall Street Journal laying on the ground like in continue

519
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:09,137
Scott: to intentionally make companies inefficient Thus requiring more human labor.

520
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:09,419
Scott: No, no.

521
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:22,458
Rym: I'm talking about like what could the government of this country do like right now to make the situation To make the best of the current situation not talking about what could we have done in the past not talking besides

522
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:23,140
Scott: public works

523
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,557
Rym: But right now like specifically what could we do?

524
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,520
Scott: Hire all the let the car companies go out of business and hire all of them to build the bridges and the roads?

525
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,780
Rym: No, the power lines because actually there is a nice article about.

526
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:51,372
Rym: Basically the Democratic Party and Barack Obama are kind of taking a gamble in that They're pushing for action to be taken and there he's kind of taking a big role in this already Even though he's not president yet, but he's a senator.

527
00:39:51,412 --> 00:39:52,195
Scott: He can still Senate.

528
00:39:52,335 --> 00:39:53,860
Rym: He's not taking the Senate in role.

529
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:56,867
Rym: He's taking the president in role That's true, but he can still.

530
00:39:56,887 --> 00:40:02,758
Scott: you know, if he's taking the president in role and you know something You know is required some legislation moving through you can go to the Senate and vote.

531
00:40:02,798 --> 00:40:06,835
Rym: Yes Control the House and Senate so we can't anyway and Bush vetoes it.

532
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:07,800
Scott: Well, yeah, don't wait.

533
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,760
Scott: No, don't the don't the new senators and House people not go in until the next session or whatever.

534
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,490
Rym: But we already control this business.

535
00:40:14,691 --> 00:40:15,939
Rym: just we control it more anyway.

536
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:22,020
Rym: One of the ideas and I'm the idea wasn't this but I expanded on this idea.

537
00:40:22,502 --> 00:40:26,178
Rym: Here's what I would do were I the president and I would do it by.

538
00:40:26,198 --> 00:40:34,760
Rym: you know Getting Congress on board and you know Executive orders and all the different ways The president can pull strings and press releases and speeches to get people on board with this.

539
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:40,720
Rym: But I would one bail out the companies if they agreed to my terms.

540
00:40:41,962 --> 00:40:46,380
Rym: The terms would be yes, you will be bailed out in return.

541
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:47,946
Rym: we will either get.

542
00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:52,641
Rym: the government will either get a controlling interest in the company or He got.

543
00:40:53,144 --> 00:41:01,420
Rym: the board of directors will be replaced or Added to by government regulators who will basically sit on the company.

544
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:04,512
Rym: Make sure that you don't waste any of the money we gave you.

545
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:23,577
Rym: make sure that the end goal which is to make sure jobs are available in these places to prevent the average people from being screwed happen and basically take over the companies halfway as the government and force the companies to do what's in the best interest of the country and Part of that would probably be not paying out these bonuses and all sorts of.

546
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:29,721
Rym: you know minutia that I don't want to get into now and I can't think of a better way to handle it than that I Would.

547
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:33,720
Rym: just bailing them out encourages them to do the same bullshit to us in the future.

548
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:38,919
Rym: Yeah, not bailing them out screws a whole lot of people in a way that I'm not willing to do.

549
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:46,152
Scott: The problem is right is even if the government took over these, you know Let's say the government took over Ford in that way, right and they they did all.

550
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,500
Scott: let's assume the best possible situation.

551
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:50,093
Scott: Right did all the right things?

552
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:50,839
Scott: they you know.

553
00:41:51,201 --> 00:42:01,020
Scott: every single person who's getting paid a lot of money is now getting paid poop and you know We're just making sure everyone still has jobs and we do everything we can to you know, try to make it profitable.

554
00:42:01,181 --> 00:42:11,299
Scott: Maybe right now all the taxpayers own this unprofitable company that slowly loses money for everyone all the time instead of you know, just losing money for this set of shareholders.

555
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,810
Scott: and It's you know, it's we got.

556
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,400
Rym: that's why one way to go about it.

557
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:24,259
Rym: Instead of having the controlling interest like owning the stock in the company is Having government people on the board who can veto anything stupid the company tries to do.

558
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:25,385
Rym: basically It's just so.

559
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:33,320
Rym: the government still doesn't have the liability beyond the bailout But at the same time the government has the control to force the company to act in the best interest of the nation.

560
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:35,329
Scott: Yeah, but even then when is the government gonna?

561
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:37,599
Scott: you know, we got to have some anything like that.

562
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,746
Rym: Yes There's a lot of minutia.

563
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:39,672
Rym: I've thought them all through.

564
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:40,779
Rym: I don't want to spend 20 minutes.

565
00:42:41,302 --> 00:42:44,760
Scott: Anything like that needs some sort of phasing out deal where you know, we let it go.

566
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:47,427
Rym: That is very clearly part of the plan.

567
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:51,800
Rym: I could tell you my specific idea, but yeah, I don't know.

568
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,101
Scott: I'm just.

569
00:42:52,242 --> 00:43:02,698
Scott: I'm more interested in not you know, the particular very specific government right now solution But in sort of the entire world society solution of you know.

570
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:04,294
Scott: Right now we have an account.

571
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:09,014
Scott: the world Economy basically says if you provide labor you'll be you get something.

572
00:43:09,055 --> 00:43:10,560
Scott: if you don't provide labor you get nothing.

573
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:18,809
Scott: But there is less demand for labor than there are people who will provide it and thus they're people who no matter what they do There's no one who wants, you know to feed them.

574
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:21,700
Scott: Basically, what do we what do we do as that ratio?

575
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:28,900
Scott: Changes and technology is not yet solved it even though it may in the future just an alternate system of distributing scarce resources.

576
00:43:29,403 --> 00:43:29,926
Rym: Simple done.

577
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:31,919
Scott: Yeah, what system would that be?

578
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,647
Rym: So anyway things of the day.

579
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:41,349
Scott: Oh and the things.

580
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:44,480
Scott: they in the middle bears playing hockey.

581
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:48,071
Rym: I'm not going to explain to you whether or not this is real.

582
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:53,085
Rym: I simply want you to observe the spectacle of Bears playing hockey.

583
00:43:53,566 --> 00:43:58,220
Scott: only this could only be in an old Russian video in what I can only assume is a Russian circus.

584
00:43:58,362 --> 00:44:06,100
Scott: You must be All right, so, you know for much of my life, you know being at least Jewish by birth and whatnot.

585
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:08,760
Rym: You know it as opposed to Jewish by injection.

586
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:21,950
Scott: Yeah, it has been very apparent that you know Despite there being gourmet chefs and iron chefs that the the greatest chefs in all the world are Jewish and Italian Grandmas, right they can out cook anyone, you know you get.

587
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,880
Scott: you know, fancy guy went to culinary school from France.

588
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,812
Scott: Whatever, you know get someone's grandma up ins and they got nothing right?

589
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:30,477
Scott: It's it's just well known.

590
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:31,360
Scott: It's it's a fact.

591
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,022
Scott: That's how it is.

592
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:37,080
Scott: So I was wondering why aren't the old Jewish and Italian grandmas on the TV cooking shows?

593
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,847
Scott: Why are at these culinary people?

594
00:44:38,907 --> 00:44:41,336
Scott: Why why don't the grandma's open up the restaurants?

595
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:42,420
Scott: They just cook for the family.

596
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,354
Scott: They never open up a restaurant or anything, you know, they could rake it in.

597
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:46,520
Scott: who wouldn't want to go, you know.

598
00:44:46,922 --> 00:44:52,359
Scott: It's like this amazing special treat to get like, you know Grandma's food maybe three times a year somewhat something like that.

599
00:44:52,822 --> 00:44:56,200
Scott: If you could just go and buy it whenever you want it all man's it would be amazing.

600
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,369
Scott: And I had a much simpler idea of.

601
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:00,799
Scott: you know, why doesn't someone just you know?

602
00:45:01,462 --> 00:45:04,897
Scott: Make a YouTube or something of their grandma cooking.

603
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:10,000
Scott: and You know, I had that idea for many years much like I had the idea for dig for many years.

604
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:10,989
Scott: Well close to it.

605
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:12,200
Scott: Everyone had the idea to make slash.

606
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:13,807
Rym: See you avoided that.

607
00:45:13,868 --> 00:45:15,455
Rym: you would have been the one.

608
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:21,520
Scott: you would have been the man Everyone in the whole world knew wanted a slash dot where the people where the users voted.

609
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,910
Scott: Yes, but now we see one person did it and everyone else.

610
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:25,592
Scott: but it's just going.

611
00:45:25,632 --> 00:45:29,740
Rym: fuck I know because now we see what we Have wrought and we despair.

612
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:43,263
Scott: that is true head is true because dig made me lose faith in all forms of internet democracy, but You know the idea to had just videotaped grandma cooking has been around for a while and no one did it until Just now.

613
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,992
Scott: some guy did it and that's my thing of the day.

614
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:46,600
Scott: It's a let's see feed me.

615
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,499
Scott: Bubby is the name of the video this.

616
00:45:49,683 --> 00:45:51,900
Scott: Yeah, Bubby is the Hebrew word for grandma.

617
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:55,734
Scott: so and he's he's got his Yiddish grandma and she's cooking it up.

618
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:56,778
Scott: and it's a video.

619
00:45:57,139 --> 00:46:01,699
Scott: and Some of the videos are loading a little slowly when I tried to watch them downstairs, but they work.

620
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:09,951
Scott: So just you know, pause it let it load up and learn how to cook Traditional Jewish grandma food, which is you know, the best food there is.

621
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,918
Scott: so, you know, why watch Food Network?

622
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:15,986
Rym: I don't know alright, so, uh Martin Luther King jr.

623
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:19,540
Rym: I'm gonna read the bed because you don't know about this.

624
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,400
Rym: This is I'm curious to see your reaction, but I'll start by reading the FARC headline.

625
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:24,345
Scott: Well, how I don't know.

626
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,054
Scott: first of all, he wasn't that really rich.

627
00:46:26,094 --> 00:46:27,140
Scott: so how does he have a big estate?

628
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,919
Rym: I'm going to start by reading the FARC headline and I'm going to work from there.

629
00:46:32,942 --> 00:46:37,145
Rym: Hopefully I will elucidate all That can be elucidated.

630
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:39,452
Rym: illuminate all that can be illuminated.

631
00:46:39,853 --> 00:46:43,965
Rym: all this and more as I'm in an illuminated manuscript Free at last.

632
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:45,412
Scott: Thank you God almighty.

633
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:47,080
Rym: We're free at last.

634
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:49,519
Rym: Licensing and registration fees still apply.

635
00:46:50,304 --> 00:46:50,659
Scott: Okay

636
00:46:51,500 --> 00:47:15,540
Rym: basically The story is that the Martin Luther King estate is a rigidly controlled Copyright trademark machine and if you want to have a picture of Martin Luther King or quote his speeches or do anything Anything at all and they go after people who use up You know all their rights to parody and such too and they do anything they can to force their trademark and copyright rights.

637
00:47:16,243 --> 00:47:18,432
Rym: You need to pay the estate of Martin Luther King jr.

638
00:47:18,713 --> 00:47:19,677
Rym: To use his speeches.

639
00:47:19,697 --> 00:47:20,240
Rym: his likenesses.

640
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,274
Scott: You can't put I have a dream on YouTube without paying money.

641
00:47:23,636 --> 00:47:25,444
Rym: Ah, that is correct You can't.

642
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:26,748
Scott: what about the federal government?

643
00:47:26,768 --> 00:47:28,093
Scott: shouldn't the federal government have to pay?

644
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:31,659
Scott: they got Martin Luther King Day Shouldn't have to pay for that holiday.

645
00:47:32,103 --> 00:47:33,979
Scott: Basically, it's infringing that holiday.

646
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:38,499
Rym: they forced people to pay to license the likeness of Martin Luther King jr.

647
00:47:39,435 --> 00:47:41,868
Rym: and all of his words and anything depicting.

648
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:48,890
Scott: if it's Martin Luther King Day and I draw a picture of Martin Luther King and put it outside my business saying Isaac Newton Ferris jr.

649
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,790
Rym: King's nephew and head of the nonprofit Is his name really Isaac Newton?

650
00:47:53,253 --> 00:47:53,554
Scott: Yes.

651
00:47:53,675 --> 00:48:14,620
Rym: Oh my god Head of the King Center in Atlanta said the estate is entitled to hundreds of thousands of dollars in licensing fees maybe even millions due to Merchandise depicting Martin Luther King standing next to Barack Obama that is being sold on the streets throughout this nation.

652
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,785
Scott: Well, that's that's just not true.

653
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:18,960
Scott: He's gonna go to court and lose because now they win these all the time.

654
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,084
Scott: Well, you can't treat you.

655
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:22,393
Scott: It's someone's it's the picture of a person.

656
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:24,159
Rym: They trademarked Martin Luther King jr.

657
00:48:24,721 --> 00:48:28,977
Scott: You can't trademark what a person looks like especially if they're a stork or famous person.

658
00:48:29,057 --> 00:48:29,940
Scott: They did you can't.

659
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,805
Scott: How did they win in court?

660
00:48:32,026 --> 00:48:32,970
Rym: They just win.

661
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:39,340
Scott: All right, so I'm Trey, you know, so wait Yes, anyone is allowed to you know, take like photographs in public, right?

662
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:40,866
Scott: Right, am I right?

663
00:48:40,886 --> 00:48:49,879
Rym: roach realizing the value of his ideas King himself Copyrighted well registered the copyright of several of his speeches during his lifetime after he died.

664
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,566
Scott: Do you can copyright his speech?

665
00:48:51,606 --> 00:48:52,229
Scott: You can yes.

666
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:52,651
Rym: Yes.

667
00:48:52,671 --> 00:48:54,920
Rym: So all mine all of his speeches are copyrighted.

668
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,239
Rym: That's fun not in the public domain.

669
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:58,704
Scott: Maybe so.

670
00:48:58,825 --> 00:49:00,249
Rym: but well, yes, it's so.

671
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,674
Rym: he's not that old remember.

672
00:49:02,055 --> 00:49:04,143
Rym: basically nothing enters the public Don't ever?

673
00:49:04,284 --> 00:49:08,120
Scott: if sure right the speech itself is not entered the public domain.

674
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,247
Scott: I could not print it in a book right?

675
00:49:10,669 --> 00:49:13,900
Scott: However, he was in public right when he gave speed.

676
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:27,060
Scott: There are certain speeches he gave in public places where he could be videotaped Publicly and if you appear in public and are videotaped by just someone standing there They own that video even if you're in it and you have no say whatsoever.

677
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:32,320
Scott: Yes, however That's why you know the news can just go out with video cameras and put things on the news.

678
00:49:32,464 --> 00:49:44,160
Rym: however most of these things or at least a lot of the ones that you see have Ended up being falling under the copyright or in the very least have ended up with this group being paid royalties or other.

679
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:46,896
Scott: Yes, that's also right.

680
00:49:48,142 --> 00:49:50,520
Scott: It's just if you a picture of Martin Luther King.

681
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:59,843
Scott: Well, I'm sure there's a picture of him somewhere and that picture itself was taken by a photographer And that photographer owns the rights of that picture and I could just be like no I'm.

682
00:50:00,104 --> 00:50:02,574
Scott: I'm making a likeness of that picture and the photographer is letting me.

683
00:50:02,594 --> 00:50:04,260
Scott: I'm not making a likeness of Martin Luther King.

684
00:50:04,826 --> 00:50:06,160
Rym: I can tell them on whatever I want.

685
00:50:06,261 --> 00:50:12,873
Rym: The legal issues around this are extra complicated But many people have tried to fight against these people and lost over the years.

686
00:50:13,234 --> 00:50:14,158
Scott: Why are they losing?

687
00:50:14,198 --> 00:50:14,840
Scott: This is ridiculous.

688
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:16,725
Rym: So what what they're doing now?

689
00:50:16,966 --> 00:50:23,886
Rym: quote Ferris says he expects to announce deals in the coming weeks to license some items featuring Images of Martin Luther King jr.

690
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:33,520
Rym: And Barack Obama that are going to be sold in the King Center and on websites and things alongside recordings of speeches postcards calendars mugs bearing images of King and other licensed merchandise.

691
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:36,775
Scott: Yeah, I guess I guess they want.

692
00:50:36,836 --> 00:50:50,814
Rym: you know It's so weird that someone Scott the estate even sued CBS over their you their sale of a video documentary on Martin Luther King that happened to include excerpts from the.

693
00:50:50,834 --> 00:50:52,040
Rym: I have a dream speech.

694
00:50:52,180 --> 00:51:03,590
Rym: Well as much as I like Martin Luther King and the appeals court ruled in 99 that the speech was in fact covered not public domain and Eventually CBS settle out of court for a large amount of money.

695
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:04,714
Scott: what the hell wusses.

696
00:51:05,136 --> 00:51:06,100
Scott: no one fights for anything.

697
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:13,344
Rym: Well, because the court basically said CBS you can't win this anyway, they It's weird.

698
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:14,993
Scott: It's like everyone likes Martin Luther King.

699
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:15,798
Scott: He's totally awesome.

700
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:16,240
Scott: I guess success.

701
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:19,616
Scott: I can think of people who don't like the KKK doesn't like him, but everyone else likes it.

702
00:51:19,656 --> 00:51:26,380
Scott: and You know, the thing is it's the Martin Luther King's, you know foundation or trust or whatever these people are.

703
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,140
Scott: It's their job to guess make people like and know Martin Luther King even more.

704
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:35,840
Scott: But they seem to all they want to do is make people not like Martin Luther King.

705
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,908
Scott: They want to make it, you know, keep them out of the textbooks Keep them out of the schools.

706
00:51:39,968 --> 00:51:41,053
Scott: Keep them out of the t-shirts.

707
00:51:41,113 --> 00:51:43,750
Scott: make it so no one sees them No one hears them and no one likes.

708
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:47,569
Scott: and if that's what they want Maybe we should just stop talking about Martin Luther King.

709
00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:49,356
Scott: Let's not put his picture anywhere.

710
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:52,560
Scott: Let's not talk about him Let's not put up his videos or anything.

711
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:56,840
Scott: Let's just pretend like you did because that seems to be what they want right just like the record companies, right?

712
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,129
Scott: Oh, you know, sure.

713
00:51:59,169 --> 00:52:01,380
Scott: We want our job is to make everyone like this music.

714
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,811
Scott: We're gonna do that by making sure nobody hears it.

715
00:52:04,474 --> 00:52:04,715
Scott: Sure.

716
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:08,360
Scott: If that's what you want fine No one will listen to your music and we won't like it anymore.

717
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,299
Rym: But I'm surprised you didn't know about the long-term issues with the fact that the can never heard of this before ever.

718
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,108
Rym: the King Estate is one of the most.

719
00:52:15,188 --> 00:52:17,260
Scott: very surprised that they haven't won in court.

720
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,880
Rym: The King Estate is one of the most aggressive pursuers of copyright actions in America outside of the RIAA.

721
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,160
Scott: See this comes back to what you know, Lawrence Lessig and Cory Doctorow and all those people always say about copyright.

722
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:30,170
Scott: is that this you know, this copyright.

723
00:52:30,271 --> 00:52:31,718
Scott: and then there's this culture.

724
00:52:31,939 --> 00:52:46,460
Scott: and These people are using copyright not to you know, get the temporary monopoly to incentivize creative endeavors but to actually Strangle culture and to remove things from the culture.

725
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,374
Scott: The record companies are removing their music from the culture.

726
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:53,900
Scott: the you know The King Estate is trying to remove Martin Luther King from the culture.

727
00:52:54,041 --> 00:53:01,440
Scott: I know that's not probably their goal in their mind, but by aggressively You know trying to enforce these copyrights and trademarks and things.

728
00:53:01,922 --> 00:53:12,060
Scott: That is the result of what will happen if they get their way on those issues is Martin Luther King will be More removed from the culture than he is now where he is very much a part of the culture.

729
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:16,500
Scott: Now one thing I say the best solution is to just let the people dig their own graves.

730
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:23,839
Rym: the the article that slash shot the specific article that slash shot links to is Pretty bad and actually has some inaccuracies in it.

731
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,420
Rym: So I wouldn't go by that but this is something that's bothered me for as long as I've known about it.

732
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:40,680
Rym: But as Scott said, I think the relevant quote here is to promote the progress of science and useful arts By securing for a limited time to authors and inventors the exclusive right to the respective writings and discoveries.

733
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:42,328
Scott: Yep, I mean this is remote.

734
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:45,563
Rym: the progress of science and useful arts Yeah, that is the.

735
00:53:45,844 --> 00:53:49,397
Rym: that is the only reason we have copyright law according to the Constitution.

736
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:49,798
Rym: That's it.

737
00:53:49,878 --> 00:53:50,240
Rym: It's there.

738
00:53:50,421 --> 00:53:53,380
Scott: Well, that's it's actually enumerating the powers of Congress.

739
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,899
Scott: So it's actually Congress has the power to promote the you know, useful arts, etc.

740
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:04,020
Rym: It's although Congress has the power to grant inventors and artists exclusive rights in order to promote the progress.

741
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,611
Scott: Yes by making laws and yes the whole right.

742
00:54:06,912 --> 00:54:08,620
Scott: Anyway, the thing is right.

743
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:12,194
Rym: I would argue that any law that doesn't clearly show to promote the progress of science.

744
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:13,660
Rym: Do you is unconstitutional?

745
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,728
Scott: Yeah, well, that's the thing.

746
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:15,880
Scott: Do you remember the Grokster case?

747
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:16,803
Scott: Yes that we lost.

748
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:19,654
Scott: yeah in the Grokster case, right or was I forget what?

749
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:20,858
Scott: or was it that Sonny Bono?

750
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:21,340
Scott: but there?

751
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,120
Scott: I forget exactly.

752
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,020
Rym: They're like eight cases Sonny Bono, but basically they went to the suppose the one where you lost and they're right.

753
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:27,582
Rym: Yes, you can.

754
00:54:27,823 --> 00:54:29,489
Scott: you can extend it the Sonny Bono.

755
00:54:29,509 --> 00:54:31,395
Rym: You can't extend it anymore after this.

756
00:54:31,456 --> 00:54:33,565
Scott: Well what that wasn't it easy That was the next one.

757
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:34,389
Scott: that wasn't it either.

758
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:35,455
Scott: basically what it was.

759
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:36,360
Rym: timeline of this shit.

760
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:44,380
Scott: Listen that the Sonny Bono Copyright Act extended copyright from I guess What was it 75 years to 99 years something like that, right?

761
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,748
Scott: And they went to challenge it in the Supreme Court.

762
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:54,760
Scott: and the Supreme Court says, you know Well, you know the the law says limited right that the Constitution says limited times.

763
00:54:55,141 --> 00:55:01,717
Scott: So when they argued at the Supreme Court, they said look because they keep extending copyright every time it's about to expire.

764
00:55:01,737 --> 00:55:12,874
Scott: It's effectively Unlimited and even though there's this particular law has a limit of 99. by keep making these extensions It's effectively unlimited and therefore unconstitutional.

765
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:14,160
Scott: That's the argument they made us.

766
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:19,482
Rym: But I remember this that the Supreme Court basically said that if they continue to do it No No what the kind?

767
00:55:19,502 --> 00:55:29,352
Scott: what they said is look they extended to 99 and they had a reason to extend it to 99 because of all The recent things that have been going on on the internet and whatnot, right?

768
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:31,580
Scott: There was a reason for this extension.

769
00:55:31,881 --> 00:55:35,996
Scott: We don't see, you know, some sort of trend of infinite, you know extension.

770
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:40,020
Scott: That's exactly what I was saying No, no, they didn't say don't extend it anymore.

771
00:55:40,321 --> 00:55:54,929
Scott: Well, they said was if there becomes a trend of extending it with the purposes of making it infinite Yeah, they said, you know if there is a further extension if there's no reason for the further extensions and whatnot then maybe Maybe then they won't be allowed.

772
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:58,320
Scott: but you know, they didn't rule out any further extensions either, right?

773
00:55:58,581 --> 00:56:03,200
Scott: They said if there is more extensions without reason then maybe this argument would work.

774
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:11,229
Scott: the problem is they no one has tried to make the argument based on the first part, which is Promotion of the useful arts and sciences.

775
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:11,791
Scott: Are you?

776
00:56:11,811 --> 00:56:17,420
Scott: no one is not that I've seen not in the Supreme Court anyway Not in a big case that was all over the internet geek news.

777
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,380
Rym: But maybe in the past, I mean copyright has been extended many many many times and that's true.

778
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:42,711
Scott: And I think I remember I'm not sure about this But I think I remember someone saying, you know, one of those big lawyers maybe Lessig or someone else Saying after that case we should have argued the useful arts and sciences instead of arguing, you know the limited You know time and you know, and I just don't know, you know I think if we made that argument is presented well that we would totally win.

779
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:48,280
Scott: like look we have a situation where software patents are Actually doing the opposite or promoting useful.

780
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,004
Rym: Here's why it wouldn't work.

781
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:58,018
Rym: because the argument against that is that they are in fact promoting and they have a Equally sounding valid argument and no one on the Supreme Court understands the issue.

782
00:56:58,078 --> 00:57:00,105
Rym: No, no one Involved.

783
00:57:00,185 --> 00:57:05,549
Rym: I would say that no one involved in the judiciary Understands what the issue is with software patents.

784
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:12,520
Rym: No, I would argue that not a single judge in the world actually Understands why we don't like software patents.

785
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:16,071
Scott: No, but if you went to zoom in court explain, you know, they're not.

786
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,727
Scott: you know, some of the judges are not good But they're not stupid people.

787
00:57:19,767 --> 00:57:21,514
Scott: They if you explained it to them.

788
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:22,900
Scott: They're smarter than Ted Stevens.

789
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:27,240
Scott: They could maybe figure it out and some of them would probably get to be in your favor.

790
00:57:27,482 --> 00:57:34,736
Rym: But then again if remember they if they don't understand the issue Then someone on the opposite side will give an equally valid sounding argument against you.

791
00:57:35,398 --> 00:57:37,830
Scott: Yeah, it's true but I think that you know you could.

792
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:41,266
Scott: it's a much better chance of Winning an argument about.

793
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:44,220
Scott: is this promoting the useful arts and sciences then winning the argument?

794
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:46,588
Scott: Is this limiting and I think clearly.

795
00:57:46,668 --> 00:57:58,420
Scott: here we have a situation where Martin Luther King that is estates Aggressive, you know enforcement of their copyrights is actually not doing the opposite of promoting useful arts and sciences.

796
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:03,580
Scott: It is removing Martin Luther King a very important and beloved person from the popular culture.

797
00:58:04,082 --> 00:58:09,800
Scott: It is preventing people from being creative and using his likeness to create new arts and sciences.

798
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:23,739
Scott: It's actually causing an overall decrease in The promotion of useful arts and sciences and you could demonstrate that you know just by showing look There've been more, you know, all these things pulled off a YouTube were useful arts and now they're gone because of this thing.

799
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:27,033
Scott: yet Them themselves are not, you know doing an equal.

800
00:58:27,154 --> 00:58:32,257
Scott: so in some, you know This is demoting useful arts and sciences and therefore no good.

801
00:58:33,902 --> 00:58:36,474
Scott: No one's made that argument as far as I know not a lawyer.

802
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:39,807
Rym: I'm kind of hungry Before we wrap this up.

803
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:42,280
Rym: I do want to point out and we're gonna talk more about this.

804
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:53,640
Rym: We're gonna make a little audio bit or something about it whenever we get a chance but there'll be a link in this post to a post in our forum, but The long story short is that a very good friend of ours a member of the front row crew is now a teacher.

805
00:58:54,306 --> 00:59:00,979
Rym: The school does not have enough books in their library for like kindergarten through third graders.

806
00:59:01,885 --> 00:59:03,720
Scott: Do we have any kindergarten through third grade books?

807
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:14,680
Rym: So what we are asking what we are putting out to you if anyone is interested in helping these kids out in this school Where they're soliciting donations for chapter, but earlier I'll read a quote.

808
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:24,679
Rym: We need books that are appropriate for grades K through 3 early readers stuff picture books graphic novels like owly for instance Easy chapter books DVDs CDs audiobooks, etc.

809
00:59:25,382 --> 00:59:33,046
Rym: Any books that speak to about minorities and other cultures are a big plus since we want the library's contest because versus for students population Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

810
00:59:33,769 --> 00:59:39,030
Rym: if you're interested at all and helping these kids There's an address linked to in the forum.

811
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,134
Rym: You can send these books.

812
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:41,860
Rym: They will be much much appreciated.

813
00:59:42,568 --> 00:59:46,735
Scott: Man that's always so weird Just like that like schools today like don't have libraries and I was a kid.

814
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:54,260
Scott: my elementary school Had a big-ass library middle school big-ass library high school double big-ass library and there were two town libraries.

815
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:55,770
Scott: He had so many fucking libraries.

816
00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:05,873
Scott: every freaking school, you know and sure the elementary school had older books and the middle school had a little bit newer and the high school had newer and Then school had a gigantic library that I don't think any students ever used.

817
01:00:06,555 --> 01:00:07,900
Rym: we had a card catalog.

818
01:00:08,323 --> 01:00:10,420
Scott: Well, we had card catalogs in every library, you know.

819
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,448
Scott: That was only slowly replaced with computers.

820
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:15,260
Scott: now dial in dial in directly my modem.

821
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:20,038
Scott: I'd call the library's modem on the phone and search the library to see what books are there.

822
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:30,399
Rym: in middle school we had a multimedia server that had 20 CD drives in it and You could access multimedia stuff anywhere in the school from that one server.

823
01:00:30,821 --> 01:00:33,756
Rym: Except more than two people used it at once it totally slowed down and stopped working.

824
01:00:33,816 --> 01:00:34,379
Scott: But yeah.

825
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:37,140
Rym: But actually, you know, I'll read the whole thing.

826
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:44,240
Rym: As some of you know I recently started teaching kindergarten third grade art at a charter school in the Albany New York area.

827
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:49,740
Rym: The school is an entity as an entity several years old and moved into its brand new building in August.

828
01:00:50,363 --> 01:00:53,599
Rym: The upside is that the facility is amazing and the students and teachers love it.

829
01:00:54,101 --> 01:01:01,364
Rym: I even have an LCD projector that is mounted on my ceiling so that I can show images from the computer via plugs in the On my desk.

830
01:01:01,565 --> 01:01:02,348
Scott: RIT styling.

831
01:01:02,851 --> 01:01:05,120
Rym: Yeah, you know, we were really spoiled going to RIT.

832
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:12,328
Scott: Yeah, the hell is at RIT, right when you're just RIT student and RIT is the only place you ever, you know Gone to college right you go.

833
01:01:12,348 --> 01:01:13,172
Scott: Oh man RIT.

834
01:01:13,232 --> 01:01:13,915
Scott: It's all bricks.

835
01:01:13,955 --> 01:01:14,377
Scott: It's ugly.

836
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:15,100
Scott: It sucks, right?

837
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,180
Rym: Every single classroom had a gigantic perfect projector.

838
01:01:18,622 --> 01:01:24,269
Rym: We had Elmo's and like all the really oh my god Like the facilities of like all this technology everywhere.

839
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:27,743
Scott: and it's like not until you go to like a state school Do you realize?

840
01:01:27,824 --> 01:01:29,352
Scott: wow, you don't have anything.

841
01:01:29,392 --> 01:01:30,920
Scott: it's like you have one projector for the college.

842
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:32,326
Rym: I would at IBM.

843
01:01:32,346 --> 01:01:35,720
Rym: I remember my first day on the job at IBM and I went to this big meeting.

844
01:01:35,842 --> 01:01:37,160
Rym: It was like yeah come to this meeting.

845
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:42,106
Rym: It's like the monthly blah blah blah meeting and it's important but you can kind of get a feel for all the stuff we're working on.

846
01:01:42,752 --> 01:01:47,349
Rym: and they had a Transparency projector and that was it.

847
01:01:47,549 --> 01:01:48,693
Scott: RIT didn't have any of those.

848
01:01:48,814 --> 01:01:49,797
Rym: I know we had Elmo's.

849
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:50,118
Rym: Yeah.

850
01:01:50,279 --> 01:01:51,122
Rym: Oh my god We're almost.

851
01:01:51,142 --> 01:01:54,960
Scott: I guess some teach I guess like maybe one or two teachers had the transparency but not you know.

852
01:01:55,702 --> 01:02:01,440
Rym: You know, it might be worth it to buy an Elmo because think about the things we could do at panels with an Elmo.

853
01:02:01,882 --> 01:02:02,345
Scott: It's all you.

854
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:14,502
Rym: I'll see how much money they are Anyway, and it's skip skip skip which has been used in projects regarding owly Dragons and textures on them and Kiki's delivery service Mm-hmm.

855
01:02:14,884 --> 01:02:22,279
Rym: the downsides that when they left the old building that they shared with another's charter school with whom they were affiliated They left the library behind.

856
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:24,767
Scott: So then why didn't they bring the library?

857
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:27,036
Rym: because the other school it was the other schools library.

858
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:27,840
Rym: they couldn't just take it.

859
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:29,128
Scott: Oh, I get it.

860
01:02:29,289 --> 01:02:37,300
Rym: So I'm gonna say this While it would be funny to send them a road sick of doji Do not send them a road sick of dough.

861
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:44,590
Scott: Why don't they just you know sort of like save up a you know, a bunch of money and solicit donations and then just buy You know the penguin classics collection.

862
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,494
Rym: That's a good idea.

863
01:02:45,515 --> 01:02:46,640
Scott: It's just instant library.

864
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:55,346
Scott: Of course elementary school kids couldn't read any of those hard real books, but you know, all right Instant library say if you have Donations send them here.

865
01:02:55,947 --> 01:03:03,820
Rym: if you want to do a separate donation drive to buy the penguin books collection for some other school in The future that's a really good idea and we'll do that later.

866
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:10,717
Rym: But for now send books for kindergarten through third graders that do not involve over fiends to the address linked to in the forum.

867
01:03:10,737 --> 01:03:12,705
Rym: I Swear to God.

868
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:15,240
Rym: if any of you send them a road sick of doji, I'm gonna cry.

869
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:22,359
Scott: Realize you send them a road sick of doji They're just not gonna give it to the school and we're basically getting free copies of a road sick of doji for us.

870
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,446
Scott: Yes, in fact, is there a neurosica?

871
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:25,068
Scott: doji manga?

872
01:03:25,489 --> 01:03:25,850
Scott: Yes.

873
01:03:26,271 --> 01:03:28,037

01:03:28,057 --> 01:03:29,821
Scott: the cheapest Elmo's $692.

875
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:32,149
Rym: that's less than I expected.

876
01:03:32,189 --> 01:03:33,534
Scott: That's that's the cheapest one.

877
01:03:33,554 --> 01:03:35,099
Scott: that basically does like jack and shit.

878
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:37,547
Scott: It's a camera on a stick.

879
01:03:37,788 --> 01:03:38,971
Rym: Yeah, but how?

880
01:03:38,991 --> 01:03:40,336

Rym: Alright, he was a long time ago.

882
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:46,715
Scott: It's basically this is the cheapest one is a camera on a stick and then a surface to put your stuff on.

883
01:03:46,936 --> 01:03:54,055
Scott: the fancy Elmo's Right the like are very very expensive like $3,000, but they have many many fancy features.

884
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,620

Scott: the fancy one is a built-in monitor.

888
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:10,464
Rym: I feel like an Elmo at a gaming con at some sort of like burning wheel panel would be boss Maybe.

889
01:04:10,484 --> 01:04:11,971
Scott: yeah, they're definitely good for gaming things.

890
01:04:12,052 --> 01:04:16,380
Rym: Alright, you know, they'd be really good If I was running a game like show someone how to play a board game.

891
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:24,886
Scott: we could just put the board game on the Elmo and then Of course, you know, we could just put a webcam on a stick for like 40 bucks Yeah, and then no reason to buy the Elmo.

892
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:25,829
Rym: actually we should.
