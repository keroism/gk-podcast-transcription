1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,537
Rym: It's Tuesday, January 21st, 2014.

2
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:10,798
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:15,496
Scott:  And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,270
Rym:  And this is GeekNights tonight.

5
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,588
Rym: Nidhogg, let's do this.

6
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:30,730
Rym: I spent my birthday weekend out skiing.

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,155
Scott:  Did not die.

8
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:33,142
Rym:  Did not die.

9
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:34,210
Scott: I'm a pretty good skier.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,519
Scott: Your odds of dying increase.

11
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,130
Scott: It's like buying an extra lottery ticket every time you go skiing.

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:39,816
Rym:  See, now you say that.

13
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:40,950
Scott:  One of them's gonna win eventually.

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,810
Rym:  You say that, but... - The hospital lottery.

15
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:54,270
Rym: But statistically, people who injure themselves skiing tend to be either people who are very unskilled, skiing where they shouldn't, or people who are highly skilled also doing highly dangerous things.

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,110
Scott: Olympic people have gotten killed during Olympic events.

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,173
Rym: Yes, during Olympic events.

18
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:03,110
Rym: That kind of skiing is pretty intense compared to what I do on an average slope.

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:12,209
Scott: It's not, you know, when you ski in the Olympics, it's big, the perfect snow, it's just open, there's nothing around, it's not like there's trees or rocks or anything.

20
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:13,741
Rym: There's different skiing events.

21
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:14,809
Rym: They're not all just the jump.

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,781
Rym: What do you think they do in the Olympics?

23
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:17,670
Rym: Have you ever watched an Olympic ski?

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,923
Scott:  Slaloms, usually.

25
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:19,470
Scott:  Yeah.

26
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:20,574
Scott:  Moguls.

27
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:21,910
Rym:  Yeah, what about the biathlon?

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,982
Scott:  You're not really going as fast in the biathlon.

29
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,210
Scott:  You gotta go pretty fast.

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,037
Scott: No one's died in the biathlon.

31
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:30,810
Scott: They die in, like, the slalom, which, you know, downhill.

32
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:33,729
Rym: I'm looking up statistics on deaths here.

33
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,730
Rym: Ski death biathlon.

34
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,179
Rym:  Up, up, Mike Dixon.

35
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,710
Scott:  He died in a biathlon?

36
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:45,268
Rym: I don't know, I searched for Olympic death biathlon and Mike Dixon came up.

37
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,137
Rym:  I'm already bored with this.

38
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:49,990
Scott:  Did he die from getting shot in the biathlon?

39
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,357
Rym:  That would be hilarious and also sad.

40
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,081
Rym:  Or from skiing.

41
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:55,562
Rym: I don't think he died in the biathlon.

42
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,850
Rym: I'm not sure why he came up in the search.

43
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,770
Scott: You don't say, because the biathlon's pretty safe.

44
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,350
Scott: If you're doing cross-country skiing, I would not make any mentions of possible dying.

45
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,610
Scott: You're doing downhill skiing, which is very dangerous.

46
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,310
Rym: Okay, there are not that many Olympic deaths ever, if you don't count that massacre.

47
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:16,129
Scott: Huh, that massacre, huh.

48
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,750
Rym: Yeah, they were not massacred by skis.

49
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,770
Scott: Oh, you sure it wasn't the ski lift just collapsing?

50
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,690
Rym: Alright, so I found one guy who died in a collision skiing during practice.

51
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:30,590
Scott:  And... - And this is an Olympic level athlete.

52
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,578
Rym: Yeah, one guy in 1964.

53
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:36,891
Rym: You realize, Scott, modern skis didn't exist in 1964.

54
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,390
Scott: They were skiing deaths up or down, per capita.

55
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,249
Rym: I'll bet they're down.

56
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,441
Scott:  You bet, huh?

57
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,010
Rym:  I would bet.

58
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,730
Rym: We can try to do some research later or we'll let someone else.

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,150
Rym: Listener, prove me or Scott wrong.

60
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,370
Scott: Skiing is mad dangerous.

61
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,093
Rym: Oh, wow.

62
00:02:50,415 --> 00:02:52,670
Rym: So yeah, there's basically almost no one who's died in Olympics.

63
00:02:53,452 --> 00:03:02,350
Rym: There's a Wikipedia page that is just every death at the Olympics, and the Munich massacre pretty much outweighs all the rest combined.

64
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,248
Scott: That's a shame.

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:03,969
Rym: Yeah.

66
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:13,330
Rym: But, yeah, Scott, basically, ski technology has changed so much between the '90s and now that the kinds of turns...

67
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,130
Scott: It's made it faster and more dangerous.

68
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:27,670
Rym: It also allows you to realize the kinds of turns, like when I turn skiing, it's actually fundamentally different from the way people turned as recently as the early '90s, because you couldn't turn that way with old skis.

69
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,630
Rym: Carving, like I do now, where you kind of like carve like a knife around the edge of the mountain, you couldn't do that with old skis.

70
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,090
Rym: You basically just fucking slide and then it was crazy and kind of really hard and dangerous.

71
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,089
Rym: Not so dangerous anymore, but I digress.

72
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,030
Rym: I think skiing is probably safer per capita than biking.

73
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,049
Rym: Just saying, just saying.

74
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,850
Rym: You seem to have a tendency lately...

75
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,090
Scott: How many guys is he dying in Tour de France?

76
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,250
Rym: I've just noticed any time... I'm going to just look up how many people have died.

77
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:56,048
Rym: Let's see.

78
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,790
Rym: Tour de France deaths.

79
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:00,370
Scott: And not from assassinations.

80
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:01,335
Rym: Tour de France.

81
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:03,890
Rym: List of professional cyclists who died during a race.

82
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:08,130
Rym: It's way longer than the list of people who have died in any Olympics ever.

83
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:09,470
Scott: Okay.

84
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,125
Rym: This is all... Oh my God, there's a lot of them.

85
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:12,509
Rym: Look at this.

86
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,410
Scott: Did they just die from work... pumping too hard or from crashing?

87
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,220
Rym: All different ways.

88
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:16,625
Rym: Let's see.

89
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:16,970
Rym: This guy crashed.

90
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,350
Scott: Only the crashing ones count.

91
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,696
Rym: This guy crashed.

92
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,043
Rym: This guy crashed.

93
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:22,010
Rym: Heart attack.

94
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:23,170
Scott: Heart attack doesn't count.

95
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,829
Rym: Murdered before the race.

96
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,520
Rym: Crash with a car.

97
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:30,149
Rym: Car crashed into him.

98
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:34,255
Scott: Yeah.

99
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,969
Rym: It's mostly Germans who died.

100
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:40,832
Rym: In like 1930, 1917.

101
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:41,857
Rym: There's a... Oh my God.

102
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:44,450
Rym: In 1913, like every German died in bike races.

103
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:47,549
Rym: Anyway, I digress.

104
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:49,259
Rym: It's Tuesday.

105
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,230
Rym: Any gaming news?

106
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:54,570
Scott: I don't have any gaming news because there's not much happening in the world of gaming right now.

107
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:57,249
Scott: I think everyone's saving it up for the PAX East and whatnot.

108
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,570
Scott: But I want to talk about... I ran some torchbearers yesterday.

109
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:02,714
Rym: Oh yeah.

110
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:04,045
Rym: Didn't you do it over a Google Hangout?

111
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:04,630
Rym: I saw you tweet.

112
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,069
Scott: We did it over the Google Hangouts.

113
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:13,550
Scott: So I got some people together from parts of the country who I knew were down with the torch and knew how to play.

114
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:17,030
Scott: And they tried to play RPG over Google Hangout.

115
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,830
Scott: And I don't know if other RPGs will work over Google Hangout, but torchbearer works pretty nicely.

116
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,183
Rym: A lot of these abstract games do.

117
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,869
Scott: If anyone knows how to play and no one cheats, it's all good.

118
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,030
Rym: You know what I think works really well over Google Hangout?

119
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,890
Rym: The Luke Crane style, like that kind of RPG, because there aren't a lot of dice rolls.

120
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,309
Rym: And the bookkeeping is mostly on the player side.

121
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,870
Scott: There are lots of apps in Google Hangout now that you just click and basically they appear for everyone.

122
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:45,290
Scott: They let you do lower thirds, which helped a lot with character names and dice rolling and all kinds of stuff.

123
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,930
Scott: So you don't even need any physical bits.

124
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,890
Scott: But anyway, I just want to say that the last time I tried to run torchbearer, it was not so good.

125
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,010
Rym: It was a disaster.

126
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:56,970
Rym: It wasn't a disaster.

127
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,929
Rym: It was kind of a disaster.

128
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:58,929
Scott: It was not too good.

129
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:04,170
Rym: Well, the disastrous moment is when, and you did so, I've done this before when I've had issues.

130
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:14,870
Rym: You stopped and said, so I'm just going to read you guys what the module says here, because I can't figure out any way to apply what the module says to what is happening.

131
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:26,690
Scott: But anyway, this time, what I did is I took the advices that were given by people who knew the game better.

132
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:37,070
Scott: And the advices were the ones that were given before, which is A, if people are going around doing stuff, like they said, they got to the perimeter.

133
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:38,169
Scott: I basically did this house.

134
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,909
Scott: I made a house according to the dungeon building rules.

135
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,529
Rym: I guess you made a straight up dungeon.

136
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,730
Scott: Yeah, well, it was a house, but yeah, it's a dungeon.

137
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,433
Rym: It's a dungeon.

138
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:48,249
Rym: Dungeon is the term for a place where people die trying to get treasure.

139
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,210
Scott: They got to the gate, and the first thing they did was go all the way around the gate in the walls, right?

140
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:56,989
Scott: So I'm like, ugh, I didn't put anything out there.

141
00:06:57,671 --> 00:06:59,869
Scott: Everything is in the house, dumbasses, right?

142
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:03,710
Scott: So they didn't have to roll any dice for that shit.

143
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:11,529
Scott: But what I did is when they were walking around it, I made sure to provide ample description and also some hints of what is in store for them, right?

144
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:13,496
Scott: But they didn't roll any dice.

145
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:17,130
Scott: It didn't take any turns to walk around and do a bump into all this nothingness.

146
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:20,810
Scott: And they didn't have to do any dice or anything until they actually bumped into something.

147
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:25,229
Scott: And it was just lots of question asking and answering, just like I was told to do.

148
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,790
Scott: And it worked just fine, right?

149
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:31,630
Scott: Just don't make them roll dice until they bump into danger.

150
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:35,330
Scott: And sure enough, eventually they bumped into a lot of danger.

151
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:42,623
Scott: They did a bunch of silly stuff for no reason, but they also did a bunch of, and that everyone seemed happy, I guess.

152
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:45,230
Scott: I mean, I don't think it was like- Did they get out with loot?

153
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:49,910
Scott: They guess they managed to camp a couple times.

154
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:53,110
Scott: And I guess they have more than zero loot.

155
00:07:53,331 --> 00:08:00,830
Scott: And I think they're gonna, when you start playing again, they're just gonna go right back in without going home first to get more stuff.

156
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:09,149
Scott: I don't have a feeling that they're going to, you know, just go straight home with the meager pickings they have now.

157
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:13,230
Rym: Well, I guess I gotta, because what I haven't done yet is actually read the entire book cover to cover.

158
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,330
Rym: So I guess I gotta do that too, and then we should try to play again locally.

159
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,789
Scott: Yeah, I know how to run it now non-crapily.

160
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:23,109
Rym: If you have one player who knows the rules 100% as well, I think we'll be set.

161
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,848
Scott: But we have four players, everyone knows the rules.

162
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,110
Rym: I'm saying if we played with our current Burning Wheel group, where no one's played any torchbearer except for their one game.

163
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:37,169
Scott: I think another factor in the running well is simply that, you know, for any given rule, like everyone knew the rules.

164
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,878
Scott: No one knew the rules 100%, right?

165
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:40,928
Scott: But everyone knew the rules relatively well.

166
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:48,058
Scott: So for any time there was a rules question, someone had a good idea of what it was, or what page in the book, or whatever.

167
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:50,330
Scott: So any rules things were solved quickly.

168
00:08:50,431 --> 00:09:01,810
Scott: Whereas where you have one person who knows the rules, if they don't know them 100% perfectly off the top of their head, they're still gonna look stuff up, and other people who are lazy and don't read rule books are sitting there waiting, right?

169
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:13,010
Rym: That's almost a classification I want to start making with RPGs, because some RPGs, the person running it needs to know the rules, like to a crazy degree of detail, or the game bogs down.

170
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,030
Rym: Some games don't work at all, unless all the players are at least familiar with the rules.

171
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:18,892
Scott: Right.

172
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:32,970
Scott: I think it's just that I'm tired of playing, you know, more and more lately, I realize I'm just tired of playing games with people, rather board game, RPG, any kind of game with people who don't know the rules, and refuse to read rule books.

173
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:47,070
Scott: It's like, I, listen, I'm not one to be a jerk and not teach you the rules, but it's like these four people over here, we all know the rules, and it'll be way fun for us to just play and bust out a game really fast, and have a really awesome competition.

174
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:54,587
Scott: And just because you happen to be here at this moment, I don't want to be mean to you and be like, "I don't want to let you

175
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:54,930
Scott: play.".

176
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,970
Rym: Have you noticed at MagFest?

177
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,343
Scott: But you playing will make us have less fun.

178
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:10,050
Rym: Did you notice at MagFest that I tended to only join games that had people who all know the rules, or I joined games where I didn't know the rules and someone else was teaching me how to play?

179
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:24,185
Scott: And this is a large aspect of abandoning board game nights for netrunning, because you play netrunner, it's like sometimes you got to teach someone to play netrunner, but most of the time it's the same people, everyone plays this game constantly, the game keeps changing so it doesn't get old, right?

180
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,730
Scott: People keep trying new stuff, and everyone knows all the rules really well.

181
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:41,850
Rym: Well, there's sort of a wider topic with board game culture in general, that the oral tradition of game learning has become so entrenched in that community that a lot of experienced players won't even think to just read the rulebook.

182
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:44,430
Rym: They expect someone to teach them the game.

183
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:51,990
Rym: And while I enjoy that, the reason I no longer like being taught how to play games is that people can't teach the game wrong.

184
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,270
Rym: Most of the people who have taught me a board game in the last year taught it to me fucking wrong.

185
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:01,509
Rym: One person taught me a game with no mistakes, and that was Ginkopolis, which I really like, and we're going to play.

186
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:03,599
Scott: Okay.

187
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,249
Scott: Think about Michael Jordan, right?

188
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,505
Scott: If you go play basketball with him, if he has to teach you how to play basketball and you suck, that's really boring for him, right?

189
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,390
Rym: Maybe not, maybe he likes a cherry case.

190
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,549
Scott: No, he doesn't, it's super boring for him, trust me.

191
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,129
Scott: Everything I've heard about Michael Jordan, he would not want to do that.

192
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:21,670
Rym: Magic might have taught you.

193
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:22,594
Scott: Maybe.

194
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:23,920
Scott: But it's the same deal.

195
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:48,950
Scott: When you become good at games, you personally thirst more for competition with people on an equal level, and it is not as pleasant to teach people who... If you at least read the rulebook, then it's at least less straining on someone who knows how to play to play with you.

196
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:57,130
Rym: I think most people who play a lot of board games in the current gaming culture climate have gone for so long without reading rulebooks that they don't know how to read them.

197
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,849
Scott: I think a lot of people just don't know how to read.

198
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:09,109
Rym: No, but I think in tabletop games, I've noticed that people who tend to be taught games and don't read rulebooks will read a rulebook and literally get nothing out of it.

199
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,150
Scott: I mean, I can definitely agree with that.

200
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,810
Rym: And these are people who are really good at games.

201
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,470
Scott: You should see how many people in online game communities, right?

202
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:19,350
Scott: It's like we have to ask rules questions online sometimes, right?

203
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,529
Scott: Especially when things are worded ambiguously and such.

204
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:32,010
Scott: But there are lots of people, if you look up game rule facts and things, that ask questions that are A. Plainly answered in the uneratted rulebook.

205
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:38,250
Scott: Or B. Plainly answered in a spot online that was visible to all they could have just searched for.

206
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:43,370
Scott: But they still typed their question in and asked it, even though it's been answered a hundred times.

207
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:50,710
Rym: I was playing hive with Pete after skiing and we had to actually look up a rule.

208
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,730
Rym: There's kind of this edge case that we couldn't figure out how to handle.

209
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,090
Rym: So we're related to the spider and his movement.

210
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,960
Scott: He goes one, two, three.

211
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,990
Scott: What kind of edge case would there be?

212
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,210
Rym: Alright, so there's a couple of edge cases.

213
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:07,430
Rym: One, the rules don't really explicitly state how to handle if the spider would move in a direction, but there's a gap he couldn't slide into.

214
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,288
Scott: He can't go in there?

215
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,937
Rym: No, I know he can't go in there.

216
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,944
Rym: Does that count as a space?

217
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:11,689
Rym: Can he move over it?

218
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,035
Scott: Well, he would go one.

219
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:16,330
Scott: Let's say he goes into that notch, right?

220
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,338
Scott: He can't move inwards, right?

221
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:20,910
Scott: So then he has to go two, three beyond the space.

222
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:24,710
Rym: Are you 100% sure that he can skip over that space like it's a step in his movement?

223
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,123
Rym: Yes.

224
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,809
Rym: Because the rules don't explicitly say, so I went to look it up.

225
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,370
Rym: And there was some other thing that came up related to... God, now I don't even remember.

226
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,470
Rym: It was something complicated related to pill bugs and mosquitoes and all this stuff together.

227
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,874
Scott: Well, that's odd.

228
00:13:38,894 --> 00:13:40,109
Scott: I can't answer anything about pill bugs.

229
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:43,250
Rym: I tried to look up the rule online.

230
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:49,230
Rym: And what I discovered was that a lot of people asked other questions about the spider's movement.

231
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:57,619
Rym: And their questions came down to, they literally didn't read the rules and didn't know how to play, and asked questions like, "The spider moves three.

232
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,663
Rym: Can he move just two?

233
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:00,630
Rym: Can I move him just one?

234
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,452
Rym: Can I choose to move him?

235
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:01,793
Rym: zero?

236
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:03,559
Rym: Can I backtrack?

237
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,345
Rym: Can the spider go on top like a

238
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:05,626
Rym: beetle?".

239
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:09,027
Rym: It's like, "No, it can't go on top like a

240
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:09,330
Rym: beetle.".

241
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,870
Scott: It doesn't say any of those things anywhere.

242
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,975
Rym: You just made that up.

243
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:14,750
Rym: Why would you even think that it can go on top?

244
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,523
Scott: Because you're illiterate.

245
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:17,369
Scott: And you didn't read.

246
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,269
Rym: "Hey, so I got a sniper rifle in Counter-Strike, so how do I zoom in with a

247
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:20,470
Rym: pistol?".

248
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:21,525
Scott: Yeah.

249
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:23,550
Rym: That's the level of question.

250
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,227
Scott: It's a SOCOM.

251
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,417
Rym: "Hey, so I got this burger and I'm eating it.

252
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,767
Rym: Am I still allowed to eat it if it's a cheeseburger

253
00:14:28,808 --> 00:14:29,149
Rym: instead?".

254
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,440
Rym: Anyway, speaking of things not looking so good, it was the fiscal year of Luigi.

255
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:42,600
Rym: And Nintendo, not to looking so good.

256
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,599
Rym: Not to looking so good.

257
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,640
Rym: You might have noticed articles about Nintendo being in dire straits.

258
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:51,000
Rym: I don't think you all might really have looked at the details here.

259
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,198
Rym: So the news was that Nintendo...

260
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,980
Scott: They have a pile of cash, but they're not making any money.

261
00:14:56,323 --> 00:14:57,260
Scott: They're losing money now.

262
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,300
Scott: They're losing money all over the place.

263
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,820
Rym: So here's the two relevant points.

264
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:09,440
Rym: Nintendo predicted that they would sell, well, shift, meaning two retail, 9 million Wii U's for the fiscal year of Luigi.

265
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:18,018
Rym: But they revised the sales predictions in March, and for the period ending in March, to 2.8 million.

266
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:20,738
Scott: And the reality was?

267
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:22,415
Rym: So that difference.

268
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,655
Rym: That they expected to sell 9 million, they barely made 3 million.

269
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:37,379
Rym: So the Wii U, as I've been predicting, and as Scott has been saying pretty much since it came out, no one bought it, and no one's planning to buy it.

270
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:38,319
Scott: That is one game.

271
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,700
Rym: 3DS sales are also down, actually.

272
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:44,555
Rym: The operating profit last year was 100 billion yen.

273
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:49,000
Rym: That was the prediction for this coming year as well.

274
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,816
Rym: Something like that.

275
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,179
Rym: Instead, you know how much money they made?

276
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,439
Rym: Negative 35 billion yen.

277
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,278
Scott: That's about right.

278
00:15:57,821 --> 00:16:00,200
Rym: Iwata gave a completely useless statement.

279
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,438
Scott: He always says the same shit, like, "Oh, we're gonna do...".

280
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,179
Scott: But they're not.

281
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,480
Scott: They need to change drastically, but they refuse to do that because that is not their culture.

282
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,739
Scott: Well, they did change drastically once.

283
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:19,200
Rym: The Game of Cube, which I think was Nintendo's console peak, the Wii was a drastic change, both in target demographic...

284
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:20,539
Scott: Right, and it worked so well.

285
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Scott: It did work really well.

286
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:24,180
Scott: But they changed their hardware, right?

287
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:26,480
Scott: But that really wasn't a change in their culture.

288
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:32,820
Scott: The culture of Nintendo has always been to try to invent new and different hardwares.

289
00:16:34,262 --> 00:16:41,960
Scott: Even though the Wii U physically as hardware was so different from previous game systems... Well, the Wii was so different from previous game systems, right?

290
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,260
Scott: Even the DS was so different.

291
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,019
Scott: Two screens!

292
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,340
Scott: No one did that shit before.

293
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:45,940
Scott: Touch screens!

294
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,780
Scott: No one did that before.

295
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:55,260
Rym: I remind you of an old show where we said we were gonna buy Nintendo DSes because we expected that they might be a Virtual Boy and it would be cool to own them.

296
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:56,620
Scott: That's not a change in Nintendo's culture.

297
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,739
Scott: That's always been Nintendo's culture, right?

298
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:00,099
Scott: And that's the thing.

299
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:09,516
Scott: While their hardware and games and systems and things may change, the culture of Nintendo since the NES SNES days has been 100% stagnant.

300
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,380
Scott: They refuse, right?

301
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:27,020
Scott: The same company from the NES days that wouldn't put Earthbound, well, Mother 1 out in the US is the same company that, you know, 20, 30 years later won't put Mother 3 translated in the US.

302
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:37,580
Rym: They decided that Final Fantasy 1, one of the most popular games on the Nintendo in America, they didn't want to confuse people by releasing Final Fantasy 2 and 3 on the NES.

303
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:47,820
Rym: So instead, they released Final Fantasy 4 as Final Fantasy 2 and then also released a completely unrelated game as Final Fantasy Mystic Quest to try and trick us.

304
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:52,100
Scott: Well, yeah, I mean that's square, I guess also partially Nintendo.

305
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,680
Scott: Yeah, Nintendo has a say in that.

306
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:03,379
Scott: They made all those games easier because they thought Americans were dumb and today they put out Donkey Kong whatever with the, you know, automatic win mode and such because it might be too hard.

307
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,540
Rym: The new Mario Tennis came out on the 3DS and they dumbed it down.

308
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,479
Rym: They literally made the game less skill-based and less fun.

309
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:11,947
Rym: The timing doesn't matter.

310
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:14,560
Rym: It's just Simon Says while Nintendo guys bounce around.

311
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:26,040
Scott: Right, that same culture of that company has been unchanged for our entire lives and the world has finally changed enough such that it is negatively impacting them.

312
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,180
Scott: You know, it's sort of like they were able to like, you know, it wasn't like a straight up and down, right?

313
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:41,380
Scott: It's like up NES, up SNES, down a little bit N64, up a little bit GameCube, up GBA, up, we, down, up, we, way up, we, we, way down.

314
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,300
Scott: Well, it's telling.

315
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,420
Scott: And now this is the down that is the bigger down that will not stop going down.

316
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,999
Scott: There's a reason I basically- It's already too- Virtual Boy down.

317
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,960
Rym: Years ago I basically liquidated- 3DS down.

318
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:55,376
Rym: All investments I had in Nintendo expecting this to all be a disaster.

319
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:56,220
Rym: and I was correct.

320
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:04,359
Rym: But if you notice, when I think back, the NES and the Super Nintendo were kind of like, they were my life at the time.

321
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:09,980
Rym: But then I got a PC and when the N64 came out, I didn't even bother.

322
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,920
Rym: And I pretty much didn't play consoles anymore.

323
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,260
Rym: The GameCube did a lot of cool things and they went in a cool direction.

324
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,600
Rym: They really started targeting games and divisions and futures that I was really down with.

325
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:28,160
Rym: And the Wii was a complete departure from that and it was valuable, but I think the reason the Wii U failed is actually very, very simple.

326
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:39,880
Rym: Independent of their culture and all these problems, the Wii sold to the so-called casual gamer, mom, grandfather demographic because it had a really compelling case for them.

327
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:49,519
Rym: It was cheap, it had these fun games, and the Wii U motion control for those simple Wii bowling, that was great for that market and they sold a ridiculous amount of these consoles.

328
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,480
Scott: Right, they basically sold, really, just a machine that plays that one game and maybe also Wii Fit, right?

329
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,060
Rym: Yeah, and otherwise it was just a glorified GameCube, but they didn't even make more GameCube style games for it.

330
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:13,500
Scott: It wasn't even, you know, it wasn't really, I mean it was a console, right, but to those people that caused the hardware to sell so much, right, the software on the Wii didn't sell as crazily as the software on other systems.

331
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,839
Rym: So when the Wii U came out, the people who bought a Wii have literally no reason to buy a Wii U.

332
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,760
Scott: They already have a toy that plays Wii bowling, right?

333
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,868
Scott: It's like they bought a Wii bowling machine, literally.

334
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:30,252
Scott: They didn't, you know, they didn't buy games for it, except for maybe, you know, that was it.

335
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:31,900
Scott: Wii Sports is the game they had for it at the end.

336
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:46,340
Rym: Yep, so then the Wii U, not only does it not do what they want, or just like they can buy it, but it doesn't buy them anything, but if you look at the advertising and look at the Wii U is, it looks like the kind of device that the kinds of people who play Wii bowling would never want to own.

337
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:58,380
Rym: It doesn't have anything for them, it would have had something for us, but I learned from the Wii that they would, they're never going to make a game that actually uses that touchpad for anything.

338
00:20:58,704 --> 00:20:58,880
Scott: Nope.

339
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,763
Rym: I know they won't.

340
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:03,519
Rym: They have never made use of any of the cool hardware they have ever put out.

341
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,978
Scott: Except the touch screen on the DS.

342
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,580
Rym: Which even then isn't also ran in most cases.

343
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,120
Rym: In fact, every game I play, every single game I play on my 3DS, the touchpad might as well not be there.

344
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:26,580
Scott: Here's the thing, Nintendo, right, for all, look throughout their history, they've been always, always about making crazy controllers of all different shapes and sizes, right, to try to get different interesting games.

345
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,579
Scott: The U-Force, the Virtual Boy.

346
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:29,058
Scott: The U-Force is not Nintendo.

347
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:29,853
Rym: Oh yeah.

348
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:34,620
Scott: The Power Glove, there was a keyboard for the NES, the Zapper.

349
00:21:35,264 --> 00:21:36,160
Rym: Yup, the Zapper was good.

350
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,380
Scott: The Power Pad.

351
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:38,691
Rym: Yup, the uh...

352
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:40,720
Scott: Super Scope we already mentioned.

353
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,640
Scott: Right, the GBAs plus GameCube.

354
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,235
Scott: Right, but think about this, even the Zapper, which is great, how many Zapper games were there?

355
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:52,919
Scott: Uh, I'm trying to think now.

356
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,220
Scott: Hogan's Alley Duck Hunt.

357
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:54,808
Rym: Yup.

358
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,659
Scott: Can you name a third?

359
00:21:57,722 --> 00:21:58,858
Rym: There were one or two more.

360
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,938
Scott: Yeah, there were, but you named them.

361
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:02,180
Rym: Uh, Bayou Billy.

362
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,295
Scott: Two or three.

363
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,520
Rym: Bayou Billy.

364
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,560
Scott: Can you name a fourth?

365
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,837
Rym: I'm working on it.

366
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:08,039
Rym: With Google.

367
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,480
Rym: Zapper Games.

368
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,440
Scott: Right, this is my point.

369
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:18,240
Scott: Nintendo, for all their controller development, their most successful controller is the D-Pad and Buttons.

370
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,000
Scott: That is the only really successful controller they've made besides the DS touch screen.

371
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:25,539
Rym: Okay, so I expected that there were a bunch we'd never heard of.

372
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,719
Rym: Uh, I can list them all right now.

373
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:29,779
Rym: Bayou Billy.

374
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,165
Scott: Mhm.

375
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,380
Rym: Baby Boomer, which was an unlicensed bullshit game.

376
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,259
Scott: Okay, it doesn't count then.

377
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,860
Rym: Barker Bill's Trick Shooting.

378
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:37,599
Scott: Never heard of it.

379
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,520
Rym: Chiller, which I owned, unlicensed.

380
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:40,440
Scott: Oh, Chiller.

381
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:41,440
Rym: Yeah, that was unlicensed.

382
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,199
Rym: That was a tangent card.

383
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,620
Scott: That kind of counts.

384
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:42,703
Scott: Yeah.

385
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:47,080
Rym: Uh, Daydream and Davy apparently used the gun?

386
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:47,918
Scott: Never heard of it.

387
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,297
Rym: Really?

388
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,759
Rym: Never heard of Daydream and Davy?

389
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:50,092
Scott: No.

390
00:22:51,182 --> 00:22:53,120
Rym: Uh, okay, I think the Angry Video Game Nerd did a thing on it.

391
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:53,657
Rym: You should watch it.

392
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,160
Rym: But, uh, yeah, that game, I didn't, I had that game.

393
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,958
Rym: I didn't know it used the gun.

394
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,615
Rym: Duck Hunt.

395
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,199
Rym: Freedom Forest.

396
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,532
Rym: Gotcha!

397
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,138
Rym: The Sports.

398
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,799
Rym: Which I think was Paintball.

399
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,680
Rym: Gumshoe.

400
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,400
Rym: Hogan's Alley.

401
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,840
Rym: Laser Invasion.

402
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,519
Rym: Lone Ranger.

403
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,256
Rym: Mechanized Attack.

404
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,159
Rym: Operation Wolf.

405
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:07,058
Rym: Shooting Range.

406
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:07,620
Rym: To the Earth.

407
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,700
Rym: Track and Field 2.

408
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,419
Rym: And Wild Gunman.

409
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,736
Rym: That is literally it.

410
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:11,812
Scott: Mm-hmm.

411
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,740
Scott: So even when they have a successful alternate controller, the culture has never changed.

412
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,939
Scott: They just make a few games for it.

413
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,279
Scott: Oh, Wii controllers.

414
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,239
Scott: Yeah, here's a few Wii Sports games for it.

415
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,480
Scott: So, make games for your successful controller that has lasted you a zillion years.

416
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,899
Scott: Your D-Pad plus buttons.

417
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,399
Scott: Make games for that.

418
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,220
Rym: Yeah, I mean, uh, they made a bunch of games on the GameCube.

419
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,600
Scott: You have the capability.

420
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,950
Scott: Just make a Super Metroid.

421
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,199
Scott: that's really fucking big.

422
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:42,780
Rym: Or another WarioWare that's local multiplayer, which we're gonna talk about in a second.

423
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:50,330
Rym: So, things of the day.

424
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:51,529
Rym: This is a video.

425
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,588
Rym: Very good video.

426
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:59,570
Rym: It is 14 minutes of goalies being really pissed off, attacking people, breaking their sticks, getting kicked out of the game.

427
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:02,450
Rym: It's just a montage of goalies being really angry.

428
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,095
Rym: Mm-hmm.

429
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:04,889
Rym: I love stuff like this.

430
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:09,409
Rym: Ever since, I don't know, I was gonna say that RIT time, but really it was ever since I was a little kid.

431
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:10,250
Rym: Okay.

432
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,990
Rym: I pretty much always loved goalies either succeeding wildly or failing miserably.

433
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:24,485
Scott: Um, so, Team Covenant, right, is this store, I think it's in somewhere like Oklahoma or some shit.

434
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:26,466
Scott: It's not any place you want to go, right?

435
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:32,610
Scott: But it says Game Store, and this Game Store primarily sells Fantasy Flight games, right?

436
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:37,989
Scott: Which happens to be the company that publishes many tabletop games like Netrunner and others, right?

437
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:58,949
Scott: And, when they were at the Fantasy Flight World Championships, right, they interviewed the CEO of Fantasy Flight games, Christian T. Peterson, and they interviewed him for like an hour, and he says some pretty fascinating shit that anyone who cares about tabletop games in the US probably will be interested in.

438
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,870
Scott: Like, why does Fantasy Flight have so many freaking Cthulhu games?

439
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,869
Scott: 'Cause the guy, Christian T. Peterson, is a big Cthulhu fan, that's why.

440
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:09,349
Scott: Why?

441
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,970
Scott: What's the deal with, um, oh, what's the stupid really long space game?

442
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,727
Scott: Is it Twilight Imperium, I think?

443
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:23,110
Scott: Whichever the one is, the really long, you know, 4X space game that they make.

444
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,768
Scott: It's like, yeah, he made it way back in the day, and they had many editions of it and whatever.

445
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,490
Scott: He talks all about how they made it and everything.

446
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:42,970
Scott: You know, he talks about how, yeah, you know, the LCGs, how what would happen is they would go to Europe, and they would try to sell, um, you know, the collectible games, sorry, the collectible card games, right, like the Game of Thrones and whatever.

447
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:43,342
Scott: Yup.

448
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,270
Scott: And how, uh, you know, the Europeans would just be like, oh, it's collectible, and walk away.

449
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:49,647
Scott: Like we do?

450
00:25:50,070 --> 00:26:11,730
Scott: Yeah, they'd be into the game, it'd be collectible, and they'd walk away, and that's how he made the LCG, and how a lot of the stuff they do is the international market, and why they have so many licensed games, and how they get such big licenses, like Star Wars, Game of Thrones, and everything, and how he was a Thrones hipster, how they were doing Thrones stuff ten years ago before it was cool, and had to give people the books so that they would like it, and pretty fascinating stuff here.

451
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,129
Scott: Um, it's, if you care about tabletop games, you should watch this.

452
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,289
Scott: That's, that's really all there is to it.

453
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:17,648
Rym: Yeah.

454
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:19,848
Rym: And the meta moment, the Book Club book is?

455
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,010
Scott: Aydaru by William Gibson.

456
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:23,249
Scott: I finished reading it a while ago.

457
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,090
Scott: When are we doing an episode?

458
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:24,744
Rym: Up soon.

459
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,930
Rym: I don't know if we'll do a show on Thursday, but we'll do one soon.

460
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:28,468
Rym: I might have stuff to do.

461
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,470
Scott: Doing stuff, huh?

462
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:30,129
Rym: Yep, maybe.

463
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:34,030
Rym: We're slowly getting back up to our full steam of GeekNights.

464
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,526
Scott: Maybe you could tell me what the next book is going to be so I can read it.

465
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:45,269
Rym: maybe even The trouble is, I just read like five books, but they're all culture books, and I feel like it would be wrong to just do another culture book.

466
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:47,190
Scott: I can make some suggestions.

467
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:58,230
Rym: Though, I think my favorite culture book after Player of Games is either Look to Windward, depending on how it ends, because I'm mostly done with it, or Use of Weapons.

468
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:00,570
Scott: I like just the title, Use of Weapons.

469
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,669
Rym: Use of Weapons might be your favorite, because you're not going to really figure out what's going on until the end.

470
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,137
Rym: You'll be like,

471
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:06,526
Rym: "Oh.".

472
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,390
Scott: I usually figure things out right away.

473
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:09,388
Rym: I know, you usually do.

474
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,290
Rym: And I'm saying with this one, you probably won't, because I also didn't.

475
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,910
Rym: I figured out a lot of things, but then there was a thing I didn't figure out.

476
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:16,586
Scott: All right.

477
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:17,102
Rym: Yeah.

478
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:22,470
Scott: I'll read it before I die, or before I am old enough that I think I should die.

479
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:25,650
Scott: I may just get killed by a meteorite tomorrow.

480
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:33,989
Rym: You know, it's funny, because that's the part of Look to Windward I'm at right now, where a guy who's this big cat-tar dude is watching someone die in the culture, because the guy's like, "Yep, I'm old.

481
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,983
Rym: I'm going to die now, but...".

482
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:35,849
Scott: Okay.

483
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:36,750
Rym: Because he's done.

484
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,209
Rym: He's bored.

485
00:27:37,632 --> 00:27:37,848
Scott: All right.

486
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:39,710
Rym: So, yeah.

487
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:40,588
Rym: Join the forum.

488
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,970
Rym: Look at all our videos on the internet.

489
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,370
Rym: Submit your panels to ConnectiCon, because we're actively scheduling currently.

490
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,349
Scott: Go to conventions like ConnectiCon.

491
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:48,889
Rym: Yep.

492
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:49,810
Scott: And PAX East.

493
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,110
Rym: Go to Magfest, even though it's a long ways out.

494
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:52,947
Scott: It's a long way away.

495
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:54,410
Rym: Go to PAX East, oh wait.

496
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,470
Rym: Get it sold out immediately.

497
00:27:56,313 --> 00:27:57,869
Scott: Go to it anyway, in force, I guess.

498
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:00,329
Rym: Book your hotel for PAX Prime now.

499
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,230
Scott: Book your hotel for PAX East 2015.

500
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:03,295
Rym: Yep.

501
00:28:04,152 --> 00:28:06,551
Scott: Book your hotel for Magfest 2015.

502
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:07,969
Rym: Magfest Hotel never sells out.

503
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:09,129
Scott: Do it anyway.

504
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:09,650
Scott: Yeah.

505
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,090
Scott: Can't hurt.

506
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:13,490
Rym: Well, because there's no room lock yet, so you'd probably pay a lot of money.

507
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:14,209
Scott: Animu Boston.

508
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:15,429
Scott: Not too far off.

509
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:15,908
Rym: Oh, yeah.

510
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:16,429
Rym: Animu Boston.

511
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,589
Rym: I got to finish our panel stuff.

512
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,170
Scott: Let's just name every convention for the whole year that we might go to.

513
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:20,890
Rym: We're going to go to a lot.

514
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,149
Rym: These are just conventions that we're pretty much guaranteed to go to.

515
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:23,441
Rym: Yeah.

516
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,030
Scott: New York City.

517
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:26,677
Scott: Visit it.

518
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:29,650
Scott: Or live in it, if you're not a nobody.

519
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:34,649
Scott: In the ancient times, when Norse mythology was true.

520
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,270
Scott: And Odin was all badass, but still real.

521
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:41,147
Scott: And Thor was chillin' too.

522
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,950
Scott: There was a tree of life, named Yggdrasil.

523
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,603
Scott: And it was a tree, just chillin'.

524
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:51,910
Scott: But there was this badass dragon, and that dragon would be all like, "Man, I'm thirsty,

525
00:28:51,972 --> 00:28:52,096
Scott: yo.".

526
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,049
Scott: Because, you know, fire parches the throat, you know?

527
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,890
Scott: You got to fire breathe and whatnot.

528
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:57,244
Scott: Yeah.

529
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,701
Scott: And the dragon was so badass, it didn't just go to the Pacific Ocean or whatever and be like, "Gulp, gulp,

530
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:01,965
Scott: gulp.".

531
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,309
Scott: That water tastes like shit.

532
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:04,670
Scott: It's full of fish and whales.

533
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,422
Scott: This tree, this dragon, he'd go to that tree and he'd be like, "Hey, you're the tree of life.

534
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,788
Scott: Water's good enough for you, it's good enough for

535
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:12,909
Scott: me.".

536
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:13,937
Scott: Right?

537
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:16,890
Scott: In fact, only the water that's good enough for you is good enough for me.

538
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,870
Scott: So I'm just going to bite on your root here and suck that shit out.

539
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:20,869
Scott: Take that tree.

540
00:29:21,032 --> 00:29:22,229
Scott: Look how badass I am.

541
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,689
Rym: Yup, here's a picture of him just kind of biting on the tree.

542
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:25,220
Rym: Yup.

543
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,309
Rym: Just hanging out down there.

544
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:32,368
Scott: That is one badass dragon, just like, "Yeah, fuck you, I'm drinking from yet untasted

545
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:32,870
Scott: wells.".

546
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:36,990
Rym: That was a good reference.

547
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:44,190
Scott: So some dudes decided to make a game named after this dragon.

548
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,670
Scott: That game is named Nidhug, which is the name of the dragon.

549
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,509
Rym: Won a lot of awards.

550
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:52,750
Rym: It was one of those indie games that just wins a bunch of awards at things.

551
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,830
Scott: They were working on this game for years.

552
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,790
Scott: Years and years and years.

553
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:59,810
Scott: And you could play this game at various indie gaming events, some of which I went to.

554
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,330
Scott: I didn't play it, but I saw it played.

555
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:11,430
Scott: And, you know, there would be like, people set up arcade machines like baby castles and those sorts of places where this was one of the games you could play, but the game was not yet released.

556
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:13,150
Scott: It was not available for all the world.

557
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:20,050
Scott: It was some, you know, exclusive boutique item only available to a few, you know, privileged people.

558
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,470
Rym: Yeah, but look at this wooden controller set up for it.

559
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,908
Rym: Right.

560
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:32,390
Scott: So, just like a week or two ago, the game was put on the Steam after years and years and years and years of development.

561
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:37,889
Scott: Why did it take so long to make a game that looks all pixely and shit that you think would take someone five minutes?

562
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:45,249
Scott: Because they polished that turd till it was so shiny and smooth, you couldn't even hold on to it anymore.

563
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,809
Rym: The phrase that I learned from...

564
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,530
Scott: Breathing left a noticeable mark upon its surface because it was so polished.

565
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:56,070
Rym: I believe the phrase that I learned from, was it Miles or Mayhem?

566
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,069
Rym: Miles Mayhem?

567
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,568
Rym: I think it was Miles.

568
00:30:59,090 --> 00:30:59,183
Scott: Okay.

569
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:06,670
Rym: So in Mask, that show, Miles Mayhem or Max Mayhem, I forget which one of them because they were brothers.

570
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:15,030
Rym: I think Max was dumber than Miles, said that his car, in learning to drive it, a minute to learn, but a lifetime to master.

571
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:15,966
Scott: Oh, okay.

572
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:23,850
Rym: This game is a pure two player direct competition ortho game.

573
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:34,290
Rym: It is such a pure and beautiful competition that I think it is going to spawn for the wider gaming group, the wider gaming culture.

574
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:38,190
Rym: A renaissance of this kind of symmetric multiplayer versus game.

575
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:44,910
Scott: Well, I think that was already sort of spawned and this is not stage zero, but it's like stage one.

576
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:45,870
Rym: Alright, well I'll put it this way.

577
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,430
Rym: This game brought it to wider attention.

578
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:52,110
Rym: Because dive kick even was in this genre.

579
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,650
Scott: Right, so I'm seeing a lot of this lately, right?

580
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,510
Scott: So Magical Drop 5 came out on Steam, right?

581
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:02,229
Scott: That wasn't really a huge hit, but it's like if you go to MAGFest, there's people playing Magical Drop, right?

582
00:32:02,472 --> 00:32:04,490
Rym: Well no, there were people playing Windjammers.

583
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,100
Scott: That's another thing I want to mention.

584
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,986
Scott: is Windjammers, right?

585
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:14,570
Scott: Which I only resent because it was on the same Neo Geo machine as Magical Drop, so it was hard to play Magical Drop when all these bros were playing Windjammers.

586
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,510
Scott: Another two player direct versus game, right?

587
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:31,505
Scott: It's like usually that genre, you know, a video game where two people play against each other in some sort of competition, it's over very quickly, was limited to pretty much fighting games mostly, right?

588
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:41,430
Rym: Unless you reach way back to Atari where there wasn't really AI yet, so the majority of the Atari games were that style of game.

589
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,449
Rym: Combat, Outlaw, Slot Racers.

590
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,828
Scott: We're talking one on one, it's not a fighting game, right?

591
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:59,690
Scott: So, you know, this is something that has been, always been sort of popular, but has been sort of underserved genre of gaming, and now it is getting extra served.

592
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,170
Scott: I'm seeing lots of stuff coming out.

593
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:03,389
Scott: Andrew really likes that Bari Bari Ball thing.

594
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,010
Scott: But Nidhug is the latest hottest entrant in the category.

595
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:12,269
Rym: So the game is really simple, it's symmetric, you got two dudes.

596
00:33:12,811 --> 00:33:13,107
Scott: Two dudes.

597
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,289
Scott: Orange dude and yellow dude.

598
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,089
Rym: The dudes have swords.

599
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:28,490
Scott: And they're trying to get to the end, so orange dude is on the left, I think, the orange dude's on the right, and orange dude is trying to get to the left, as far as he can possibly go to where victory lies, and yellow dude is on the left.

600
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:30,546
Rym: All you have to do is get all the way to the end.

601
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,950
Scott: Fight as far as he can go until he finds victory.

602
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:44,870
Rym: The screen is some number of, the field is some number of screens across, and you have an arrow, and whichever color has the arrow, you just have to go and get to the next string, It's quite similar to football, right?

603
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,830
Scott: If the ball is you, get yourself to the end zone.

604
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:48,504
Rym: Yep.

605
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:52,010
Rym: So if you have the arrow, you just try to get past the other dude.

606
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,670
Scott: Well, at the beginning of the game, no one has an arrow.

607
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,348
Scott: We'll get to that.

608
00:33:54,551 --> 00:33:56,590
Scott: You're just standing there, and you gotta fight.

609
00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:58,130
Rym: So here's what you can do.

610
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:03,828
Scott: If you die, the other guy, if you kill the other guy, or he dies, you get the arrow, which means you can go.

611
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,568
Rym: So here's what you can do.

612
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,690
Rym: You can walk, which is basically running.

613
00:34:08,251 --> 00:34:08,726
Rym: You can jump.

614
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:11,029
Rym: Out of a jump, you can roll.

615
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,168
Scott: You can't roll out of a jump.

616
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,188
Rym: You can land and then roll.

617
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:17,429
Scott: You can just roll without jumping.

618
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,549
Rym: Yeah, you can just do that.

619
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:19,728
Rym: You can dive kick.

620
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:20,668
Scott: Dive kick.

621
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:25,579
Rym: You can pick up a sword, and then you can fence with it and/or stab with it and/or throw it.

622
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:26,889
Rym: You can punch.

623
00:34:27,514 --> 00:34:29,670
Rym: You can rip out a motherfucker's heart with your bare hands.

624
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,489
Scott: If you aren't holding a sword.

625
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:32,005
Rym: Yes.

626
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:33,670
Rym: But if you have a sword, just stab him.

627
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,610
Rym: You don't need to pull the heart out.

628
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:39,070
Scott: Well, you punch when you lose your sword, usually by throwing it or being disarmed.

629
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,268
Rym: Now, if you kill the other guy, then you get right of way.

630
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,748
Rym: Just go, go, go, go, go, and the other guy tries to stop you.

631
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:56,069
Scott: Well, the other guy will respawn in front of you after some amount of space, and then you will have to either jump over him or murder him, or at least find some way around him to continue going.

632
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:02,929
Scott: But if he kills you, then he gets the right of way and can now go in the opposite direction which you want the game to go.

633
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,650
Rym: If you make it all the way to the end, you win that match.

634
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,067
Scott: Yep.

635
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:07,725
Rym: And that's it.

636
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,028
Rym: There's no score other than who won.

637
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:10,770
Scott: Who wins.

638
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:11,084
Rym: You go.

639
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,629
Rym: It's just, this is why this game won.

640
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,649
Scott: This is built in tournament mode.

641
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:21,670
Rym: Is probably one of the most obvious candidates for the PAX Primal Megathon finale that has ever existed.

642
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,289
Scott: I agree.

643
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:27,310
Rym: It is exciting to watch, it is exciting to play for the same reasons that Pong is exciting.

644
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,190
Rym: There is one positional heuristic.

645
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:32,049
Rym: Which screen are you on?

646
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,610
Rym: There's one victory condition.

647
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,648
Rym: You got to the end.

648
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:35,770
Scott: I mean, think about this.

649
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:39,910
Scott: The first two video games were pretty much Space War and Pong.

650
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:48,110
Scott: Both of them were two-player direct versus games, yet that kind of game disappeared, you know, a lot.

651
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,489
Scott: There's very few of those, except fighting games.

652
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,389
Scott: Very, very few.

653
00:35:52,073 --> 00:35:56,070
Rym: You can block, you can disarm someone by moving your sword over their sword.

654
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,109
Scott: I already said that.

655
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,450
Rym: You can wall jump if you hit a wall.

656
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:03,050
Rym: You can sort of run up at Kung Fu style and then jump back down.

657
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:06,430
Rym: You can hang onto a ledge and kind of hang out there for a little bit.

658
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,249
Scott: You don't want to do that.

659
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,468
Rym: Sometimes you want to do that.

660
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:10,427
Rym: Okay.

661
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:17,710
Rym: But the fact, much like Pong, if say I'm playing Pong against Scott and I get nine points, it's nine on nothing.

662
00:36:18,431 --> 00:36:21,650
Rym: There is no mathematical reason Scott couldn't come back from that and win.

663
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,970
Rym: Every single match of Pong, every single point is a completely separate, stateless game.

664
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,969
Rym: Tennis is the same way.

665
00:36:29,591 --> 00:36:33,590
Rym: I could be match point and I could come back from nothing to win.

666
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:40,909
Rym: So as a result, this game will be exciting and the second it's no longer exciting, that's because it's over.

667
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:46,710
Scott: Pretty much any game like that, those are the perfect games, right, tennis?

668
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,069
Rym: There's no way to grief.

669
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:54,715
Rym: There's no way, it's a two player competitive game and the fact that it's local multiplayer is even more key.

670
00:36:54,775 --> 00:36:59,687
Rym: because there is, watching people play this, they get really into it really quick.

671
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,869
Scott: I mean, I played it with some people who weren't that into it, but most people get into it.

672
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,986
Rym: People I didn't expect to get into it, they're like, "I don't know,".

673
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:10,390
Rym: and then they start playing and playing and playing and playing and playing.

674
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,347
Scott: Just watching it on YouTube, I was like, "Oh shit, this game, it's

675
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:14,708
Scott: on.".

676
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:15,868
Rym: It is on.

677
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:18,930
Rym: Now, this game illustrates something that Divekick also illustrated.

678
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:28,570
Rym: The people who are obsessed with these ultra complex fighting games and MOBAs, in a way these games are like anti-MOBAs because the heuristics are direct and obvious.

679
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:35,410
Rym: Everything in the game is so straightforward and the, I mean, look at Divekick, you can jump and you can kick.

680
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,370
Rym: You can't even, there's not even a direction, there's no D-pad.

681
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,150
Rym: And yet that game is actually a deep and complex fighting game.

682
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:47,470
Rym: If you think that it's just bullshit because it's so simple, I defy you to beat the people who win the tournaments.

683
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:48,388
Rym: Go nuts.

684
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:49,308
Rym: Have fun.

685
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,848
Rym: They're just as more better than you at that than that guy who's good at Fox.

686
00:37:54,928 --> 00:37:56,568
Rym: only, Final Destination, no items is.

687
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:06,828
Scott: All right, and this is the thing is all games in general, sometimes you add complexity to a game and you actually added meaningful, more difficult decisions to be made.

688
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:07,710
Scott: that actually, right?

689
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:18,130
Scott: It's like, you know, if you take, I don't know, so if you have Street Fighter and you only have punch and you add kick, kick, that's a meaningful difference, right?

690
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,230
Scott: That you now have punch and kick versus just punch, right?

691
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:33,462
Scott: But if you start adding tons and tons and tons of stuff, eventually a lot of that stuff becomes redundant, like it's either a projectile, slightly more fast, slightly less powerful, or do you throw this slightly faster.

692
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:34,186
Scott: that, you know, it's like

693
00:38:34,326 --> 00:38:54,028
Rym: some of those things will either fall inside of the Pareto frontier, meaning they're objectively worse than all other options you have, like literally you only use them if you wanted to lose, like playing as Dan, or they're so powerful compared to the rest that people use only that, like snaking, or in some broken shitty fighting game, sweeping the leg.

694
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:56,590
Rym: Oh, you can sweep the leg in Nidhag.

695
00:38:57,271 --> 00:39:05,110
Scott: Yeah, but it's like, you know, oh, okay, so we'll add, people will just like add mechanics on mechanics to make a game so complicated, right?

696
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:30,390
Scott: It's like, you took Street Fighter, originally Street Fighter was just, you know, six attacks, jumping, ducking, blocking, and special moves, and it's like, alright, now we're gonna add in supers, and then we're gonna add in ultras, and then we're gonna add in, you know, like focus attack, dash cancels, and it's like, at what point, you know, is it like you're just adding more stuff and it's not actually enhancing the game in any meaningful way?

697
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:40,610
Rym: Now, I'm not saying there's not a place for complex games like that, but a lot of the people who are really into those games, and MOBAs are the biggest offender, other than fighting games at this point, culturally.

698
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,110
Scott: And then we'll add the secret shop, and then we'll add the boss, and then we'll add the-.

699
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:43,291
Scott: They

700
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:59,710
Rym: really like to denigrate simpler games as, oh, well, I play my MOBA because the skill cap is so high, these games have equally high, or effectively equally high skill caps within the realm of what humans are capable of, but yet, they're intuitive enough to where you can learn by playing or watching.

701
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:07,109
Rym: I dare you to learn how to be effective at Dota 2 just by watching what other people do- And watching one game of it.

702
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,450
Rym: Yes, without commentary from them explaining why they're doing what they're doing.

703
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:11,811
Rym: Another

704
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:27,630
Scott: thing that's good about games like this, and say Outlaw, right, is that because you can sort of learn everything there is to know about the game in like 30 seconds, the winners of the game, they tend to be really good for determining like who truly is better, right?

705
00:40:27,951 --> 00:40:33,425
Scott: Whereas, you know, I might be way smarter than someone, you know, someone is just objectively not smart.

706
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:33,950
Rym: Yeah, you might be.

707
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,929
Rym: I mean, there's a possibility that might happen somewhere.

708
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,770
Scott: Yeah, they just failed everything at school, and they're just not a smart person, right?

709
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:46,436
Scott: But they spent a long time with Dota, and they know a lot of Dota specific information, right?

710
00:40:47,596 --> 00:40:48,629
Scott: I might lose to them.

711
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:55,688
Scott: If I bothered to study Dota, I probably maybe could just beat them every single time because I maybe have more skills than they do.

712
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:00,710
Scott: But because they studied it, and I didn't, and it requires study, I can't beat them.

713
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,870
Scott: So is it really testing who is better?

714
00:41:03,451 --> 00:41:04,869
Scott: What does that result of that game mean?

715
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,389
Scott: It means they studied more.

716
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:12,465
Scott: But if we play some Nidhug, right, and you know, you only need to study it for like five minutes.

717
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:20,148
Scott: So after about like 10 tries, you know, or at most, every game henceforth is more meaning.

718
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,430
Scott: Like the result means something.

719
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:30,370
Scott: It means, look, you know, we've both played this game enough that there is no secret in it that the other person does not know, but I keep winning every time.

720
00:41:30,893 --> 00:41:31,909
Scott: That means something.

721
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:33,148
Scott: It means I'm better than you.

722
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:43,369
Rym: At the same time, it's a very complex, I mean, if we want to get into what the core test of skill of a different game is and what's the difference between a practice skill and a knowledge skill, I think a better example might be chess.

723
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:56,590
Rym: Because chess, no matter how smart you are and how good you are at games, if you haven't studied and played and practiced chess, you're going to lose to someone who has, even if you are the almighty god of games in a general sense.

724
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,104
Scott: That's true.

725
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,410
Rym: But if you want to make chess your thing, then you'll be good at chess.

726
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:13,890
Rym: But playing chess by itself is not going to teach you likely to become much better at chess, but studying chess and reading books about chess will give you specific insights that make you demonstrably better immediately.

727
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:16,550
Scott: I want to see someone who's really good at chess.

728
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:21,810
Scott: Let's get Kasparov and teach him Puerto Rico and see if he can get good at Puerto Rico.

729
00:42:22,891 --> 00:42:28,970
Scott: Does the specific knowledge of chess patterns help you at all to play regular board games?

730
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:36,309
Rym: Or play Bobby Fischer's randomized chess, where you can't study openings because the starting set is different every time.

731
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,385
Scott: Maybe.

732
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:38,383
Rym: Yeah.

733
00:42:39,271 --> 00:42:40,750
Rym: As long as you have basic chess heuristics.

734
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:41,418
Scott: Sure.

735
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:44,530
Scott: I think we would still lose at that because there's still a lot of chess stuff.

736
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:44,850
Rym: We would.

737
00:42:44,910 --> 00:43:04,768
Rym: But I remember as a kid, a lot of my friends were really good at chess, and then one day I decided, all I did was I looked online and I found two openings that were classically known openings, and I memorized my first 10 moves for those two openings, and I memorized a couple of variations in case the people did something different, and I just winged after that.

738
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,545
Rym: And I won 90% of the chess games I played with people who weren't chess experts after that point.

739
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:21,549
Rym: That knowledge alone made me unreachable to players who did not have that knowledge, even if they were otherwise smarter than me and better than me at chess, other than having memorized an opening.

740
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:29,589
Rym: But anyway, this game is just one in a long line of a genre that a lot of people don't really think about.

741
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:36,709
Rym: I think now that the year of Luigi is finally gone, it's going to be the year of local multiplayer and the year of two player ortho games.

742
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,749
Scott: Two player games are where it's at.

743
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:39,989
Scott: Outlaw remakes.

744
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,910
Scott: All kinds of shit is coming.

745
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:42,928
Rym: Now think about why.

746
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:44,570
Rym: There's no politics.

747
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:49,567
Rym: There's no way for the person who's losing to ruin the game for everybody else, because the game ends.

748
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,348
Rym: There's no way for griefing.

749
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,030
Rym: There's no way for politicking.

750
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,890
Rym: It's just a competition, pure and simple.

751
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,790
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

752
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:08,869
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

753
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:14,310
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

754
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,230
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

757
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,790
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

758
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:32,930
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

759
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,106
Media: She came into the shop and said, "I want to know what the problem

760
00:44:59,206 --> 00:44:59,286
Media: is.".

761
00:45:00,552 --> 00:45:02,945
Media: I said, "You don't want to know what the problem

762
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:03,226
Media: is.".

763
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:08,345
Media: And she said, "I want to know what the problem is so I can get the problem

764
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:08,867
Media: fixed.".

765
00:45:10,091 --> 00:45:15,699
Media: I said, "You don't want to know what the solution to the problem is, and you don't want to know what your problem

766
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:15,860
Media: is.".

767
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,769
Media: She says, "How do you know that I'm not going to like

768
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:19,890
Media: it?".

769
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,721
Media: I said, "I know you're not going to like

770
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:21,882
Media: it.".

771
00:45:23,411 --> 00:45:27,149
Media: So she said, "Just tell me what it is, and I'll tell you if I like

772
00:45:27,229 --> 00:45:27,270
Media: it.".

773
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:32,728
Media: And I said, "Maybe, maybe I'll tell

774
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:32,868
Media: you.".

775
00:45:33,653 --> 00:45:34,968
Media: She said, "Why won't you tell

776
00:45:35,028 --> 00:45:35,109
Media: me?".

777
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,542
Media: I said, "The problem's your

778
00:45:36,743 --> 00:45:36,804
Media: ass.".

779
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:38,658
Media: She said,

780
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:39,045
Media: "What?".

781
00:45:39,512 --> 00:45:40,761
Media: I said, "The problem's your

782
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:41,164
Media: ass.".

783
00:45:42,632 --> 00:45:43,039
Media: She said,

784
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:43,487
Media: "What?".

785
00:45:43,912 --> 00:45:46,149
Media: I said, "The problem's your fucking ass.

786
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:49,987
Media: Your ass is all fucked up, and you got problems with your

787
00:45:50,268 --> 00:45:50,429
Media: ass.".

788
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,949
Media: She said, "Why are you saying this to

789
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:53,070
Media: me?".

790
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,909
Media: And I said, "It's your fucking problem.

791
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,082
Media: You're the one with the fucked up

792
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:57,263
Media: ass.".

793
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:00,744
Media: Started to storm out, so I said,

794
00:46:00,865 --> 00:46:01,107
Media: "Wait.".

795
00:46:01,915 --> 00:46:02,323
Media: She said,

796
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:02,649
Media: "What?".

797
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,176
Media: I said,

798
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:03,582
Media: "Wait.".

799
00:46:04,374 --> 00:46:05,150
Media: She said, "What?

800
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,103
Media: Is this about my

801
00:46:06,286 --> 00:46:06,448
Media: ass?".

802
00:46:06,913 --> 00:46:09,069
Media: And I said, "No, kind of.

803
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,006
Media: Your ass is mad fucked up, and you don't want to face the

804
00:46:13,066 --> 00:46:13,529
Media: problem.".

805
00:46:13,911 --> 00:46:14,801
Media: She said, "What's your

806
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:15,368
Media: problem?".

807
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:22,529
Media: I said, "My problem is that you come in here with a fucked up ass, and you don't want someone to tell you that your ass is fucked up.

808
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,050
Media: I don't even know how you go to the bathroom.

809
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:27,670
Media: I don't even know how you sit on things.

810
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,209
Media: When you stand up, where does your ass go?

811
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,629
Media: Where was your ass in the first place?

812
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:36,111
Media: Where was your ass in 1969?

813
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:38,511
Media: Where was your ass on 9/11?

814
00:46:38,511 --> 00:46:39,942
Media: I thought you said you'd never

815
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:40,486
Media: forget.".

816
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,762
Media: She said, "I'm

817
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:42,250
Media: leaving."

818
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:45,810
Media: And I said, "Not before you get your official diagnosis.

819
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:47,027
Scott: Here it is.

820
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:50,050
Media: You're fucked up, and your ass is fucked up.

821
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:51,082
Media: Are you ready for the

822
00:46:51,163 --> 00:46:51,690
Media: solution?".

823
00:46:52,222 --> 00:46:52,665
Media: She said,

824
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:53,028
Media: "What?".

825
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,950
Media: Nuts said, "Here's the solution.

826
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:55,516
Media: Are you

827
00:46:55,598 --> 00:46:55,883
Media: ready?".

828
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,280
Scott: "Yeah, I'll shut it

829
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:57,360
Scott: up.".

830
00:47:13,214 --> 00:47:14,989
Scott: "I'm gonna replace your ass.

831
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:18,305
Media: I'm gonna replace your ass.

832
00:47:20,751 --> 00:47:22,707
Media: I'm gonna take it off and replace it.

833
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:25,134
Media: Ass

834
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:25,661
Media: replacer.".

835
00:47:26,412 --> 00:47:26,555
Rym: "Ass

836
00:47:26,617 --> 00:47:26,822
Rym: replacer.".
