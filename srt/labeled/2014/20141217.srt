00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,427
Rym: It's Wednesday, December 17th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:10,788
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:14,198
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,888
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,919
Rym: The delightful Cucumber Quest.

6
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:18,712
Rym: Cucu.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,745
Rym: It's a webcomic.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,893
Rym: Cucu.

9
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:21,537
Rym: Cucu.

10
00:00:21,557 --> 00:00:21,799
Rym: Cucu.

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,748
Rym: Let's do this.

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,965
Rym: So, I kind of realized that I'm watching a lot of animation lately.

13
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:30,830
Rym: Like, a lot.

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,879
Rym: But I'm not watching a lot of anime.

15
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,310
Rym: I'm kind of off and on watching Yo-Yo Peddle.

16
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,590
Scott: You can just watch Yo-Yo Peddle.

17
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,228
Scott: Yeah, sure.

18
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:40,910
Scott: Every Monday, around afternoon, the new episode's up.

19
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,069
Scott: And then when you get home, Crunchyroll, you can watch it.

20
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,150
Rym: But I was also watching the old Sailor Moon.

21
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,189
Rym: Because now it's getting to the good stuff.

22
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,029
Rym: And I'm rewatching Nutenna for obvious reasons.

23
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,035
Scott: I ran out of animes.

24
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:53,210
Scott: I might have to go back on that Sailor Moon train.

25
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,065
Scott: Back when the long hair, I was a non-normal girl.

26
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,944
Rym: Yeah, so that one, Scott, basically if you have been skipping Sailor Moon, did you get up to Queen Beryl, like, getting killed?

27
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:05,890
Rym: Spoilers and all that?

28
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:10,230
Scott: No, I didn't watch any episodes since long hair guy was hitting on normal girl.

29
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,929
Rym: Oh, yeah, so I guess, yeah, Queen Beryl loses.

30
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,028
Scott: You don't say?

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,910
Rym: So, it's probably worth it to watch.

32
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,236
Rym: I didn't see that coming at all.

33
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:18,682
Scott: That's a total surprise.

34
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:19,526
Scott: A bad guy loses.

35
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:20,330
Scott: Oh my god.

36
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:28,009
Rym: It is worth it to watch Sailor Moon up until, like, all the way up until Queen Beryl loses, the end of, like, the first real season.

37
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:35,870
Rym: But if you, you can pretty much skip everything after that up until the first episode of S, if you really want to.

38
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,350
Scott: What happens in that period that Skipple is island episode?

39
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,368
Rym: So, first.

40
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:42,348
Scott: I want to see some island action.

41
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,609
Rym: First, I watched, like, the Alan and Anne part.

42
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,450
Rym: I'd never even watched that in Japanese.

43
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,270
Rym: Two aliens come down in a tree, and it's card captures.

44
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,526
Rym: It's like a lame-o card capture Sakura for a while.

45
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:52,010
Rym: You don't care.

46
00:01:53,251 --> 00:02:02,450
Rym: Then, the, like, one of the noble families from the old Moon Kingdom, who are all evil and fucked up and are on the bad guys team, they come from, like, the Nega Moon and try to fuck shit up.

47
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,310
Scott: The Nega Moon.

48
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,769
Rym: Yeah, like, Prince Diamond and all that.

49
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,870
Scott: So, this Princess Nega Moon?

50
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,570
Rym: Nah, it's just, it's more Sailor Moon.

51
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,810
Rym: Like, nothing really special happens.

52
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,230
Scott: It's still Monster of the Week?

53
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,650
Scott: There's just a different bad guy producing the Monsters of the Week?

54
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:16,570
Rym: Yes, pretty much.

55
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,990
Rym: Now, it gets into, like, the history and backstory a lot, which is cool.

56
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:27,170
Rym: But otherwise, it's not, like, super different than the first bits of Sailor Moon, except the whole team's together the whole time.

57
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,910
Scott: What about the circus part that's in that music video?

58
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,570
Rym: That's way, way, way, way later.

59
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,450
Rym: That's two seasons.

60
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:37,549
Rym: So, after that R stuff is S. Start with it, just when S starts, just watch that.

61
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:45,270
Scott: 'Cause that's when all the others... A completely different bad guy creates the Monsters of the Week, and that bad guy is better than the other one, somehow.

62
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,349
Rym: Well, that bad guy's way better, 'cause it's a complicated bad guy.

63
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,690
Scott: It's a bad guy who makes Monsters of the Week.

64
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,850
Scott: What the fuck is the difference?

65
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,530
Rym: So, you know, in the beginning Sailor Moon, it's like, new sailors come one by one.

66
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,030
Scott: They get punished in the name of the moon, just like the ones that you think I should skip over.

67
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,829
Rym: Yeah, but you know how new sailors come one by one, and then, like, the team's, like, being built out?

68
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,969
Rym: Sailor Moon R is, we already got the team, some amnesia, and we reformed the same team again, and then it's just, like, the team.

69
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:15,130
Rym: S is all the awesome Sailor Scouts coming in one by one from the outside.

70
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,650
Scott: So, different good guys fighting the Monster of the Week.

71
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,012
Scott: Yes.

72
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:19,099
Rym: And you know what?

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,630
Rym: They're just way better sailors.

74
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,029
Rym: Like, they're better at this shit.

75
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:23,499
Scott: Their boat doesn't crash?

76
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,970
Scott: They've been to the West Indies?

77
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:25,774
Rym: Pretty much.

78
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:28,915
Rym: Their boat... It's just, you know what it is?

79
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:33,110
Rym: It's Horatio, and then, like, double Horatio, and then triple Horatio.

80
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,490
Rym: Like, every sailor that comes after the first intersenshi is just better.

81
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,910
Rym: But, so, I was also watching Sailor Moon Crystal.

82
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:45,969
Rym: Because I wanted to review it.

83
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,537
Scott: I don't know why you keep watching bad things.

84
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:50,150
Scott: Have you watched every episode of Sailor Moon Crystal?

85
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,887
Rym: No, I actually stopped, and I kind of want to talk about why.

86
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:55,450
Rym: now, because there's...

87
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,374
Scott: Have you watched more Yoah pedals?

88
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:57,239
Scott: Or have you watched more...

89
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,550
Rym: I've watched way more Yoah pedals than I've watched Crystals.

90
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,000
Rym: So, here's the deal with Crystal.

91
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,550
Rym: Crystal is bad.

92
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:07,037
Scott: Don't say.

93
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:08,250
Scott: It is poorly executed.

94
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,262
Scott: We already discussed this.

95
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:09,810
Scott: Yeah, we have.

96
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:13,369
Rym: So, I was saying, "Oh, I'll watch it anyway to

97
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:13,530
Rym: review.".

98
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,385
Rym: Why?

99
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,769
Rym: Just so I can review it.

100
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,070
Scott: You've got to have something better to be watching.

101
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:19,290
Rym: Plus, it's not that long.

102
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:21,204
Scott: There's a new Mushishi season.

103
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:21,749
Scott: Why not watch that?

104
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,770
Rym: Because it moves through the story of Sailor Moon.

105
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:29,790
Rym: Aside from the fact that it's technically poorly executed, it just moves through the manga Sailor Moon way fast.

106
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,029
Rym: And that could be cool.

107
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:46,610
Rym: The thing that is preventing me from ever watching this until maybe they finish it and it's on Blu-ray is that, you know how anime nowadays, when they make the show for TV, a lot of stuff is badly animated, and then they fix it in the Blu-ray release.

108
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,099
Rym: That's totally a kill-a-kill.

109
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,024
Rym: Every anime does that.

110
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,450
Scott: Even if they fixed it, wouldn't it still be bad?

111
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,650
Rym: See, you'd say that, but here's the fucked up thing.

112
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:02,510
Rym: I'm going to link to this article that shows just a really wide collection of all the changes.

113
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,288
Rym: And it's not just that they're cleaning up the animation and fixing... They redid the whole show?

114
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,130
Rym: Basically, yeah.

115
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:10,928
Scott: Cell by cell?

116
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,310
Rym: Yeah, so basically, look at this shit.

117
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,010
Scott: Why didn't they do that in the first place?

118
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,190
Rym: Yeah, so the left is what was aired on TV and what was aired on Crunchyroll.

119
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:21,850
Rym: See all those fucked up faces, all things we're complaining about?

120
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,757
Rym: The right doesn't just redo it.

121
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,750
Rym: The right changes the style to look like the original anime.

122
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,490
Scott: The right is... Look at that one at the bottom there.

123
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:36,170
Scott: The right is a greater improvement over the original than any other show I've seen in the TV vs Blu-ray thing.

124
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,830
Scott: But it's still not incredible.

125
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,232
Scott: What do you mean?

126
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,050
Rym: it looks exactly like the original anime now?

127
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,770
Scott: It's still not so good that it's going to be worth watching.

128
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:49,110
Rym: Well, the primary problems with Sailor Moon Crystal was that technically it was very poorly executed.

129
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,569
Rym: Even though the story is fine.

130
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,270
Scott: Even if they make the design correct, the poses and whatnot are still going to be the same.

131
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:59,168
Rym: No, they're redoing the poses too.

132
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,937
Rym: They're redoing fucking everything.

133
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:02,385
Rym: It's like it's being reanimated.

134
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:03,270
Rym: It's ridiculous.

135
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:04,816
Scott: It's a big difference.

136
00:06:04,857 --> 00:06:07,070
Scott: I mean, I can't deny that it's a humongous difference.

137
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,750
Scott: Bigger than any difference I've ever seen in TV vs DVD.

138
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:13,950
Scott: It's still not good enough to be watching.

139
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:22,430
Rym: I think it'll be worth watching on the Blu-ray because Sailor Moon's main problem is that it moves so fucking slow and it goes on forever.

140
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,530
Scott: But you've got nothing better to do.

141
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:24,213
Rym: Yeah, I do.

142
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,057
Rym: And you know what?

143
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:27,489
Rym: If I'm going to watch The Slow Show, I'm watching L.O.G.H.

144
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:29,829
Scott: I'm waiting till I'm an old man for that shit.

145
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,181
Scott: I think Gerald...

146
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:33,230
Rym: Gerald said it best.

147
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:33,910
Scott: Delayed gratification.

148
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,850
Rym: He said Legend of the Galactic Heroes is best watched alone.

149
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,630
Rym: You can't watch that with someone else because you've just got to sit down and pay attention.

150
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:44,230
Scott: You'll all be dead and then I'll need something to do while waiting to die.

151
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,228
Rym: There is no way you're outliving me.

152
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,290
Scott: There is many ways, like when you die skating next week.

153
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:56,470
Rym: But independent of our divergent opinions on whether or not Sailor Moon Crystal on Blu-ray is going to be worth watching to review, here is my point.

154
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:03,625
Rym: The fact that they released Sailor Moon Crystal to TV in Crunchyroll as it is.

155
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:10,690
Rym: compared to what they're turning it into, I don't think they planned to clean it up this much because it's not just clean up.

156
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:18,490
Rym: I think that they realized they fucked it up and the bad press was getting so bad that they actually are making a stylistic decision.

157
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,369
Scott: No one in Japan is intelligent like that.

158
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,419
Rym: No, explain why they did this.

159
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,604
Rym: It's not intelligent.

160
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,630
Rym: They already fucked up.

161
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,531
Rym: I don't know.

162
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:31,750
Scott: All I can say though is that of those eight panels you're looking at, the second one on the left, right?

163
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:32,468
Scott: Yeah, that one?

164
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:32,798
Rym: Yeah.

165
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:34,569
Scott: Yeah, with the lazy eye?

166
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:34,778
Rym: Yeah.

167
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,622
Scott: While it's obviously so bad, but it's sort of like,

168
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:39,703
Scott: "Hey.".

169
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,310
Rym: Except that's not what she was saying at that scene.

170
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,595
Scott: Obviously, but it's like,

171
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:46,237
Scott: "Hey.".

172
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,350
Scott: I kind of like that that exists.

173
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:51,217
Rym: Yeah.

174
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:53,490
Rym: Wait, you want bad still images from Sailor Moon?

175
00:07:53,590 --> 00:08:02,550
Scott: If it was the better one on the right to begin with, we might not have insulted the show to begin with, but we wouldn't have that amazing, "Hey," lazy eye frame to look at.

176
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:04,410
Rym: The most stark one is the one at the bottom.

177
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,429
Scott: The bottom one where there's no depth or face, or face is like a paper sheet.

178
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,070
Rym: Yeah, it's like skeleton face.

179
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,810
Scott: It's like a paper sheet on a neck stick.

180
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,990
Rym: But the fact that I think they originally intended to clean the show up, like every anime, like Kill La Kill did the same thing.

181
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,030
Rym: And I think they have redirected to not just cleaning it up, but changing the style.

182
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:28,830
Scott: Maybe someone who sucks got fired, and then they slave drove someone else for no money all night to fix it.

183
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:36,530
Scott: But the moral is, if you care about the show at all- And that you're cracking that whip, you demanding quality animation.

184
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,898
Rym: Do not watch this show on Crunchyroll.

185
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:40,222
Rym: Do not watch it live.

186
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:41,366
Rym: Do not watch it on TV.

187
00:08:41,907 --> 00:08:42,690
Rym: Fuck that business.

188
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:48,310
Rym: If you're gonna watch it, there is literally no reason to not wait for and/or pirate the Blu-rays at this point.

189
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,369
Scott: Or you could just not watch it at all.

190
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:52,450
Rym: Yeah, you could say that about any piece of media.

191
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,949
Scott: I could say that about any bad piece of media.

192
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,113
Rym: It's not that bad.

193
00:08:56,333 --> 00:09:03,809
Rym: It's just poorly executed in a way that somehow- You wouldn't give any shits.

194
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,510
Scott: No, not necessarily, because the fact that- There are like 20 better animes you could be watching.

195
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,850
Rym: Name 20 anime that I haven't already seen that are recent, that are worth watching more so.

196
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,670
Scott: I picked a number that was too big.

197
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,549
Scott: Name five.

198
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,389
Scott: Well, there's a new Mushishi show.

199
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,196
Rym: Yeah.

200
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:21,684
Scott: One.

201
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:23,790
Scott: You haven't watched every episode of You Up, Have You?

202
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,687
Rym: Yeah, so that's two.

203
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:25,606
Scott: Two.

204
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:26,430
Scott: I can keep going.

205
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:26,655
Scott: Two.

206
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,088
Scott: There's a super deformed, uh, Hokuto.

207
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:30,470
Scott: no Ken.

208
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,870
Rym: Those always suck, unless you can show me evidence that this one doesn't suck.

209
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,708
Rym: I don't trust it.

210
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:37,630
Rym: Is it really, Scott?

211
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,123
Scott: Yeah, they just got licensed by, uh- Yeah, is it really actually good?

212
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,050
Rym: Is it the one we already watched?

213
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,150
Scott: It's better than Sailor Moon Crystal.

214
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,430
Rym: Is it the one where they work in the convenience store?

215
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:45,703
Rym: Yes.

216
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,589
Rym: Because that one kind of sucked.

217
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,070
Rym: That one's good.

218
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,249
Rym: No, you're still only named two.

219
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,159
Scott: You haven't watched Space Brothers.

220
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:53,070
Scott: There's a zillion episodes of that motherfucker.

221
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,390
Scott: Yeah, so while- I haven't watched it either.

222
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,229
Rym: Yeah, so that's a wash.

223
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:01,430
Rym: Because while arguably it is a better show- I don't have to have watched it.

224
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:04,490
Rym: It's got the old Sailor Moon problem if there's a billion episodes.

225
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,469
Scott: There's a billion episodes of, uh, fairy tales from Japan.

226
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:09,474
Rym: Yeah, and you know what?

227
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:11,849
Rym: I've watched almost all of them because that show's amazing.

228
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:15,830
Rym: I watch them, like, every time I'm mopping and sweeping and, like, doing shit in the apartment.

229
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,230
Rym: I also watch them while I'm dead in Counter-Strike.

230
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:27,110
Scott: You should make a mod for Counter-Strike where when you're dead, it would switch to VLC and then switch back when you come back to life.

231
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:29,190
Scott: And automatically pause and unpause?

232
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,048
Rym: That would be an amazing thing to make.

233
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:31,848
Scott: Alright, so make it.

234
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,770
Rym: Or even better, just have it show you a random YouTube video every time you're dead.

235
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,120
Scott: There's that some show the listeners keep telling us to watch.

236
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,610
Scott: that looks like a perverted show and I need you to confirm- Bakemonogatari?

237
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:42,263
Scott: No.

238
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,689
Rym: Because that's the perverted one.

239
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,423
Scott: Akame Ga Kill or something?

240
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:47,876
Rym: I need you to confirm- Wait, who told us to watch that?

241
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:51,729
Rym: Because I've read things that tell me that those people might be bad people.

242
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:58,210
Scott: I did a Google image search and I'm pretty sure this show is garbage, harem, whatever, pervertedness.

243
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,349
Scott: But people are saying we should watch it, so you go check it out first.

244
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:08,209
Rym: Isn't this the show that people in the Animators Network Forum were, like, flipping out when people criticized it?

245
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:12,370
Scott: I don't know anything about that because I've never been to the Animators Network Forum.

246
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,601
Rym: I am going to use a term that I've been using.

247
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:16,210
Rym: I've been saying this word a lot lately.

248
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:16,992
Rym: Skep.

249
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,129
Rym: I am skep about this show.

250
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:21,349
Scott: You're too lazy to say skeptical?

251
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:27,630
Rym: No, because skep implies this sort of, like, I am above this and I am skeptical of it.

252
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:27,972
Rym: Ah.

253
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,748
Rym: That's what skep means.

254
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,709
Scott: Well, you still need to watch it to, uh, you know.

255
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:39,730
Rym: Uh, yeah, so if I go, wait, if I have to watch the show to review it, why don't I watch the Blu-ray Sailor Moon Crystal?

256
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,658
Scott: Because you know everything is known by Sailor Moon.

257
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:43,164
Scott: You need to go and do this for me.

258
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:44,390
Scott: I don't care about Sailor Moon.

259
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:46,389
Scott: I need information about this show.

260
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,730
Rym: Scott, you would care a lot more about Sailor Moon if you knew about Sailor Moon.

261
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:54,763
Scott: Also, uh, I can think of some old animes you haven't seen.

262
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:56,730
Scott: Have you seen all of Pat LeVoir TV?

263
00:11:57,972 --> 00:11:58,308
Rym: Uh, no.

264
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:58,998
Scott: You haven't.

265
00:11:59,202 --> 00:11:59,609
Scott: There you go.

266
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:03,410
Rym: Alright, so already you've had to deviate into old-ass anime.

267
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,929
Scott: Scott, I thought you said you've seen all the anime.

268
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:06,245
Scott: Yeah.

269
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,230
Scott: But apparently one of the greatest shows of all time you haven't seen.

270
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,297
Rym: Alright, Scott, I'm going to cancel that out.

271
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:12,029
Rym: Have you seen all of Kodocha?

272
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:13,889
Scott: Uh, neither have you.

273
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:15,188
Rym: I've seen more of it than you.

274
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:20,629
Rym: All you've seen is half of that, like, movie compilation because you fell asleep during it.

275
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,268
Scott: Listen, not everyone can watch anime at TYF.

276
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,290
Rym: How much Project Aco have you seen?

277
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,930
Scott: Uh, I saw all of it a zillion years ago.

278
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,630
Rym: Have you actually seen all of it, Scott?

279
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,840
Scott: It was on Syfy Channel.

280
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:31,990
Scott: I remember nothing.

281
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:33,288
Rym: Scott, not all of it.

282
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:35,070
Scott: I was, like, who knows how old.

283
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,230
Rym: Scott, there's way more Project Aco than was aired on the Syfy Channel.

284
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,769
Scott: I saw everything that was on the Syfy Channel.

285
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,790
Rym: So you saw, like, the first one, two episodes.

286
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,930
Scott: And I remember nothing.

287
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,166
Rym: Did you see the movie Battle Gray, Battle Blue?

288
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:47,630
Rym: Well, the OAV.

289
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,370
Scott: I didn't even know a thing like that existed.

290
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,218
Rym: Well, okay.

291
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,129
Rym: Well, alright.

292
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,530
Scott: But I doubt that it is more important to watch than Battle Boy, the TV series.

293
00:12:56,411 --> 00:13:00,370
Rym: I'm betting that old Project Aco is way more important to watch than Agame Ga Kill.

294
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,603
Rym: Which, funnily enough...

295
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:04,050
Scott: I'm not defending Agame Ga Kill.

296
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,609
Scott: When I typed Agame Ga Kill... I need you to see it so that I can know.

297
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:09,890
Rym: It looks like a lot of people...

298
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,210
Scott: Without suffering on my own.

299
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,530
Rym: I tried to type Agame, and then Google was like Ga Kill and No Kill.

300
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,850
Rym: So I think people don't actually know the title of this anime.

301
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,088
Scott: I don't know what the difference is.

302
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,794
Rym: It's about an assassin group, night raid, to encorrupt... What?

303
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:23,910
Rym: What?

304
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,728
Scott: Is it like noir?

305
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:34,490
Rym: Serialization of Square Enix's Ga... The more I read about this, the less likely it is that this is good.

306
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,850
Scott: I didn't think it was good to begin with.

307
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,250
Rym: It might be a dark... It might be a perverted darker than black.

308
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,550
Rym: This might be darker than black plus Bakemonogatari.

309
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:43,278
Rym: Anyway... Anyway...

310
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,249
Scott: In news!

311
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:54,989
Scott: If you're in New York, because you're an awesome person and not somewhere else, as a totally lame-o geographical location, every other place on the entire face of the earth, this is a good week to be in New York.

312
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:57,670
Rym: Well, it's always a good week to be in New York.

313
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:08,790
Scott: An even better week to be in New York, because an even more awesome person than you is in New York, named Brian K. Vaughan, perhaps one of the greatest comic book writers alive and working at the time.

314
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,558
Rym: What's he doing here?

315
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:10,569
Rym: It's not New York Comic Con.

316
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,310
Scott: He's just hanging out in town, and tomorrow, he's going to be at the Kinokuniya Bookstore.

317
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:15,719
Scott: Huh?

318
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:17,787
Rym: From...

319
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:18,850
Scott: Which one?

320
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,949
Scott: The one near Bryant Park.

321
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:21,390
Rym: Okay.

322
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,811
Scott: From 3 to 6.

323
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:25,887
Rym: The one where we interviewed TM Revolution?

324
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:26,250
Rym: That one.

325
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,089
Scott: Yes, that one.

326
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,449
Rym: Yeah, guys, we interviewed TM Revolution once.

327
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,570
Scott: And the day after that, he's going to be in Midtown Comics downtown.

328
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:36,150
Scott: So, it's like there isn't even a convention.

329
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:39,670
Scott: But it's the only person you would need to see at a convention anyway.

330
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,070
Scott: New York is living in New York.

331
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,729
Scott: If there was a convention, he is the only person you would see.

332
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:47,910
Scott: And anything you would buy at the convention, you can buy at either of these two stores.

333
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,730
Scott: Living in New York is like being at a convention.

334
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,729
Scott: You can see him twice.

335
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,810
Scott: Go to Kinokuniya, go to Midtown.

336
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,000
Scott: It won't even take you all day.

337
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,109
Scott: You won't have to pay an entry fee.

338
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:02,269
Scott: And yeah, dude wrote Saga, so... It's better than anyone else you're going to see in your town.

339
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,469
Scott: And if you're in New York, go see him.

340
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:08,290
Scott: I might try to see him tomorrow at Kinokuniya after work.

341
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,151
Scott: He's going to be there from 3 to 6.

342
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:12,229
Scott: So, I can leave work at 5 and just walk over there.

343
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:13,268
Scott: It's really close.

344
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,629
Scott: Maybe there won't be a huge line.

345
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:16,230
Scott: Alright.

346
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,229
Scott: Or maybe I'll just go home.

347
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,890
Rym: So, I got a real quick Geek Byte here.

348
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,408
Rym: So, a show that I just ignored for whatever reason for a long time.

349
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,009
Rym: Enough people I trust told me to watch it.

350
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,810
Rym: And one of them was like, I'm just putting on a... They pulled my trick of just put on an episode while they're hanging out.

351
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:35,188
Rym: And then they'll watch it.

352
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:36,488
Rym: So, they did that to me.

353
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,649
Rym: And I watched an episode of Rick and Morty.

354
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:43,170
Rym: And Rick and Morty is really, really, really good.

355
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,930
Rym: And kind of like how I've recommended The Amazing World of Gumball.

356
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,250
Rym: And Adventure Brothers, Archer, all those shows.

357
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,650
Rym: Rick and Morty makes that vaunted list.

358
00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:01,410
Rym: Rick and Morty is basically... Imagine if Doctor Who was crossed with the Doc from Back to the Future.

359
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,730
Rym: And was fucked up and kind of mean and possibly evil.

360
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,890
Rym: And he was taking his grandson on Doctor Who style adventures through the universe.

361
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,870
Scott: That doesn't make me want to watch that.

362
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,090
Rym: Yeah, because you hate animation.

363
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,090
Rym: You don't watch anything.

364
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,089
Rym: So, I didn't even expect you.

365
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,270
Scott: Why are you watching this instead of Mamoru Oshin created Battle of War the TV series?

366
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,570
Rym: Rick and Morty is pretty fucking hilarious.

367
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:26,230
Scott: Uh-huh.

368
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,950
Rym: It's also, it's got that thing going on kind of like Adventure Brothers did.

369
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:31,410
Scott: Even robot police cops going out to get Chinese food?

370
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:36,909
Rym: That isn't hilarious so much as like sense of good-natured camaraderie.

371
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:38,630
Scott: Well, you see that episode.

372
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,470
Scott: It's actually one of those fucked up weirdo episodes.

373
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:44,730
Scott: Where everything's dark and spooky.

374
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,030
Rym: Rick and Morty has that same kind of thing going on that like Venture Brothers does.

375
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,990
Rym: Where it's funny, it's mean-spirited, it is dark humor.

376
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,170
Rym: But yet, the characters are deep and interesting enough.

377
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,850
Rym: The stories are interesting enough.

378
00:16:57,132 --> 00:17:02,590
Rym: The whole world and everything they're setting up around them is such that you actually like really get into these characters.

379
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:05,250
Rym: They can kind of grow and build on itself and do really fun stuff.

380
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:08,270
Rym: So, I'll talk about it more in depth at some point later.

381
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,310
Rym: Season 2 was supposed to air in 2015.

382
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,229
Rym: They're running out of time on that.

383
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,170
Rym: But season 1 is great and the entire thing is just totally free.

384
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,989
Rym: And you can just watch it on the Cartoon Network website like right now.

385
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:26,148
Rym: So, watch Rick and Morty.

386
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:32,710
Scott: After you watch every other show, especially the most important animation that was made.

387
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,089
Scott: We've talked about so many animes right now and so many cartoons right now.

388
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:43,130
Scott: We have neglected to mention the greatest animation that has been created in the past few months is South Park.

389
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,610
Rym: South Park's been hitting it out of the park lately.

390
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,688
Scott: I think it's been hitting it right on the park.

391
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:49,651
Rym: Well, no.

392
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:51,507
Rym: It's hitting it out of the park like a home run.

393
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,830
Scott: It's North Park now?

394
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,289
Rym: If you hit it on the park, that's at best an RBI.

395
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:57,829
Scott: It's South Park.

396
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,826
Scott: If it had it out of the park, it wouldn't be good.

397
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:04,529
Rym: That was a stretch.

398
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:13,060
Rym: Anyway, things of the day.

399
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,620
Rym: So, we're going to be at Anime Boston and we're going to be at Zenkai Con doing our anime panels and all that stuff.

400
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:20,440
Scott: Are we going to Zenkai Con?

401
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:20,858
Scott: Yeah.

402
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:22,319
Scott: Okay, maybe.

403
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:25,300
Rym: Well, it's either Zenkai Con or Genericon.

404
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:26,738
Scott: We can just not do either one.

405
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:29,460
Rym: I really need the people.

406
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,179
Rym: It's a toka kokan.

407
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,460
Rym: We perform at Zenkai Con and in return, certain high quality people staff at Kinetic Con.

408
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,051
Scott: Are they going to refuse to go to Kinetic Con?

409
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:39,300
Scott: if we refuse to go to Zenkai Con?

410
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:39,807
Rym: I don't know.

411
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:40,319
Rym: Probably not.

412
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,429
Rym: But also, you know what?

413
00:18:41,672 --> 00:18:42,439
Scott: Zenkai Con is kind of fun.

414
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,360
Scott: Because Kinetic Con is actually, like, I would go to Kinetic Con if I wasn't working there.

415
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,522
Rym: Yeah.

416
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,440
Rym: Kinetic Con is like one of... Kinetic Con...

417
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,660
Scott: Some but not all packs is Magfest.

418
00:18:54,143 --> 00:18:56,879
Scott: Even though I'm working there, I still kind of don't want to go to Zenkai.

419
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,960
Rym: But one, I'll go to Zenkai Con because we can take the train directly there and back.

420
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:01,732
Rym: And two...

421
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,000
Scott: Alright, there was that train that went back to the inn.

422
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,680
Rym: We don't really do a lot of anime cons anymore, but yeah, we have a lot of good anime content.

423
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:14,780
Rym: So in that con, I'm going to do a new version of anime openers around the world because I found some shit.

424
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,980
Scott: You did find some shit indeed.

425
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,380
Scott: Yes.

426
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:18,405
Rym: Good God.

427
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:21,520
Rym: Lupin, Lupin, Lupin.

428
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:23,159
Rym: That might be my favorite thing.

429
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:28,000
Rym: So one of the parts of that panel is the Portuguese opener to Harlock.

430
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:35,120
Rym: And I learned from both a fan and Lou that that was based... Two separate people.

431
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,354
Rym: I don't know if I call Lou a fan.

432
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:37,919
Rym: He's more friends.

433
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:39,360
Scott: I thought he's a fan of Harlock.

434
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:40,627
Rym: No, I'm not a boss.

435
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,179
Rym: The fan of us told me this.

436
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:43,838
Rym: Lou also told me this.

437
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:51,020
Rym: So that song was the way it was because the Harlock opener is like melodramatic old Japanese music.

438
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:53,351
Rym: Harlock is a melodramatic show.

439
00:19:53,995 --> 00:19:57,477
Rym: The opener in Portuguese... I've seen a bunch of it, but...

440
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,560
Scott: Why are you watching?

441
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:05,560
Rym: The Portuguese opener is that melodrama dialed up to like a million.

442
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,280
Rym: Like it's amazing.

443
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:14,260
Rym: And the reason for that is because it's based on a style of music that's basically known only to Portugal.

444
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:15,182
Rym: Fado.

445
00:20:15,843 --> 00:20:27,799
Rym: Fado, F-A-D-O, is essentially the music that came from wives wailing at the ocean in sorrow and melancholy for their husbands who are sailing the endless seas.

446
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,600
Scott: Yeah, because their ships got blowed day up by England, Spain, France.

447
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,334
Rym: Well, also just because sailing the endless seas in the 1500s and 1600s was a lot more...

448
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,618
Scott: You also just sink.

449
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,300
Rym: Mysterious and scary and amazing.

450
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,199
Scott: There'd be dragons.

451
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:51,160
Rym: So that music was why that opener was the way it was and probably why Harlock is so fucking popular in Portugal.

452
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,959
Rym: This is a video of Emilia...

453
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,880
Scott: The old ladies are big Harlock fans because he reminds them of their husbands that died at sea.

454
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:06,900
Rym: So Emilia Rodriguez, I can't pronounce Portuguese at all, I'm not sure what that accent means, is basically the queen of Fado music.

455
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,980
Rym: And this is video of her performing Fado music.

456
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,418
Rym: The melancholy might melt you.

457
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,500
Scott: So, one of the best, speaking of comics from before, right?

458
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:30,940
Scott: While Brian K. Vaughan might be one of the best living writers of comics that are printed in on the shelf of the comic book store, one of the best makers of webcomics these days be Casey Green.

459
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,060
Rym: Nah, Casey Green.

460
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:40,997
Scott: But did you know, creator of such great comics as Gunshow and Anime Club, which is part of Gunshow and such, Gunshow be ending, yo.

461
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:42,180
Scott: Oh, wow.

462
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:50,500
Scott: He's already uploaded the final Gunshows and they are displaying on a schedule, and by the end of this year, there will be no more Gunshows.

463
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,131
Scott: Possibly ever.

464
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:52,819
Scott: Likely ever.

465
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,520
Rym: You know, if you never read Gunshow, this is your trigger.

466
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,997
Rym: You might as well start because you're just going to read it all the way to the end and not have to wait.

467
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,500
Scott: However, do not fret.

468
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:08,060
Scott: Casey Green is doing two other com- well, he's doing a lot of other things.

469
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:12,739
Scott: He's done some regular show comic books and things like that.

470
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:15,460
Scott: But he is doing two other webcomics right now.

471
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:24,340
Scott: One of them is called Back, which seems to be a continuing story, beginning with some dude kicking his way out of a grave.

472
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:26,080
Rym: That's already up my alley.

473
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,872
Scott: So that, you can be found at backcomic.com, B-A-C-K-C-O-M-I-C.

474
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:37,900
Scott: And then he's also doing Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio, adapted by Casey Green.

475
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:42,940
Scott: [laughter] And that is at Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio.

476
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,399
Rym: I want to fix your nose.

477
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:44,961
Scott: Dot.

478
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,733
Scott: tumblr dot.

479
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:47,679
Scott: tumblr dot com.

480
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:59,651
Scott: So once you finish Gunshow at the end of this year, delete that from your comic rocket, which you should be using, and add these two things to your comic rocket, and you're now plus one comic.

481
00:22:59,973 --> 00:23:01,180
Scott: It's only a good thing in my book.

482
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:06,512
Rym: In the meantime, we're going to be at PAX South performing bad games on Sunday in the Armadillo Theater.

483
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:07,300
Rym: It's going to be awesome.

484
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,480
Rym: Otherwise, we'll just be there eating barbecue and making fun of the South.

485
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,049
Rym: The book club book is Watership Down.

486
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,740
Rym: It's about rabbits on a journey.

487
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,694
Rym: It's a great book.

488
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,706
Scott: Find us on the internet.

489
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:17,640
Scott: We are everywhere on the internet that you are.

490
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,300
Scott: If you are not on the internet enough, be on the internet more.

491
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,432
Rym: And join the GeekNights Forum.

492
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:23,760
Rym: We pay a lot of money for that fucking thing.

493
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:32,739
Scott: Close your eyes and imagine a room with many tables and nerds hanging out, doing many things, such as playing games with each other and chatting it up and hanging out and doing stuff.

494
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:34,427
Scott: That is the internet.

495
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:36,380
Scott: Why are you not in that room all the time?

496
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,365
Scott: We are in this room.

497
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:39,235
Scott: It has a big ass sign out the door.

498
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:40,079
Scott: You can't miss it.

499
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,158
Scott: Come in that room and then we'll lock you in.

500
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:46,578
Rym: Also, we ban people from the room who have bad grammar and spelling or who make dumb arguments.

501
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,648
Scott: There are no smelly bad guys in that room.

502
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:54,380
Scott: Occasionally, we go *sniffing* in a dumb ass into the room and have fun with them, and then they walk their own ass out.

503
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,952
Rym: Yeah, like when that Gomer Gator came in.

504
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,000
Rym: Notice how he's gone.

505
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,630
Scott: -He gone.

506
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,240
Rym: -Yeah, he gone.

507
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:58,868
Scott: -He gone.

508
00:23:58,888 --> 00:23:59,380
Scott: -He sleep.

509
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:00,933
Rym: Worldstar!

510
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,540
Rym: I need a Worldstar gift to post every time we drive that guy out of the forum.

511
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,531
Scott: -Well, go find him.

512
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:08,059
Rym: -I will.

513
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:17,480
Rym: So, speaking of webcomics that you should add to your Comic Rocket, if you haven't been reading Cucumber Quest or QQ, as the cool kids call it, that's what we're about to talk about.

514
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,618
Scott: So, Cucumber Quest is a webcomic made by a very awesome person named GG DG.

515
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:26,180
Rym: Who you should follow on Twitter.

516
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,178
Scott: The best name ever.

517
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,259
Rym: 'Cause, one, she tweets awesome art.

518
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Rym: Two, her Twitter is hilarious, and it's exactly 50% as crazy as Natasha Allegri's Twitter.

519
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,895
Scott: I followed Natasha Allegri for two days and I couldn't handle it.

520
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:40,660
Scott: It was too strong.

521
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,303
Rym: You know what?

522
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:43,580
Rym: Following her on Twitter is like just mainlining internet.

523
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,743
Scott: Yeah.

524
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:45,386
Scott: So, anyway.

525
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:48,160
Scott: So, Q, I always knew this existed, but I didn't read it.

526
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,218
Scott: 'cause it was so far along I didn't have time to catch up.

527
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,957
Rym: -I read it, like, religiously.

528
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:52,220
Rym: -Right.

529
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:55,280
Scott: Rym was reading it religiously on the webcomic version.

530
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:04,719
Scott: So, what I did instead is she has kickstarters for every volume, and she just finished kickstarting volume three, and I kickstarted one and two and received one and two, but never read them.

531
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:09,660
Scott: And volume three's on its way, and I'm probably just gonna kickstart it and read it in volumes.

532
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:15,860
Scott: 'Cause each volume, it's sort of like, it's one of those segmented stories with, you know, bosses on an adventure.

533
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:23,560
Scott: So, each volume is like one segment, so it's really easy to read that way, and a lot more comfortable and fast than reading the webcomic going next, next, next.

534
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,423
Rym: -Though at the same time...

535
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:28,940
Scott: -And I'm sure one day the printed volumes will catch up to the webcomic, and then I can switch over.

536
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:34,054
Rym: The reason I enjoyed reading it as a webcomic primarily was that because I was already pretty much caught up the whole time...

537
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:36,699
Scott: Where was it when you started reading it?

538
00:25:38,283 --> 00:25:39,749
Rym: I was reading it from near the beginning.

539
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:41,236
Rym: Like, we hadn't gotten too far...

540
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,401
Scott: -Yeah.

541
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:43,895
Scott: I did not discover it early enough.

542
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:44,360
Scott: -Yeah.

543
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:50,556
Scott: But when I did see it many years ago, you know, I saw the arts, and I was like, "Oh, my God, this comic is...".

544
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:55,860
Scott: I mean, regardless of anything else I know about, I saw, like, pictures of it, and I knew it was incredible.

545
00:25:56,463 --> 00:25:57,839
Scott: I just didn't read it because...

546
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:05,380
Rym: So, my enjoyment of reading it on the web was that because I only got one page at a time, I would spend a lot more time appreciating the art of the page.

547
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:06,879
Scott: I spent quite a lot of time appreciating...

548
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,952
Rym: -'Cause the thing... I mean, things to appreciate...

549
00:26:08,972 --> 00:26:09,760
Scott: -Any page with crabs on it.

550
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,060
Rym: The colors and framing, it has this kind of watercolor-y, awesome, washed-out...

551
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,015
Scott: -There aren't a lot of webcomics that look like this.

552
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:15,680
Scott: -Exactly.

553
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,427
Rym: The character's super cute.

554
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:20,980
Rym: She puts a lot of attention into their hair and outfits.

555
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:29,948
Scott: If you look at some of the extras in the back of the printed volumes, she shows, like, the development of, like, the character design for, like, Princess Nautilus over the years, and it's like,

556
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:30,294
Scott: "Whoa!".

557
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,079
Scott: And you can just see, like, her drawing skill getting better, and the design getting better, and everything getting better, and it's, oh, my gosh.

558
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:43,700
Rym: So, it's a story about a rabbit named Cucumber who's trying to go to wizard school, and his stupid dad makes him go save the world.

559
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,526
Rym: -Yep.

560
00:26:44,546 --> 00:26:46,138
Rym: -And he doesn't want to.

561
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,298
Scott: This is somewhere in between, right, like, Bone and...

562
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,428
Rym: -Yeah, a little bit of Bone.

563
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:53,840
Scott: -And Adventure Time, right?

564
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,938
Rym: That's a really good way to put it, actually.

565
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:07,080
Scott: It's like, Bone has some comedies, you know, but it's sort of, like, a more serious adventure, even though it has comedies, and Adventure Time is also serious and has comedies.

566
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,040
Scott: But it's mostly, "Eh..." Right, and this is, like, right in the middle of those two.

567
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:19,159
Scott: Like, you take Adventure Time, and you tone it down with some Bone, and you add some cuteness to the Adventure Time side.

568
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:26,355
Rym: Yep, like, Cucumber Quest is very self-aware, and it does a little bit of that, like, trope deconstruction, like, "Oh, the great hero has to

569
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:26,599
Rym: come.".

570
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,651
Rym: "Well, this has happened, what, 99 times before?

571
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:29,536
Rym: That seems

572
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:29,958
Rym: stupid.".

573
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:32,155
Rym: "Oh, and all the characters recognize this.

574
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:32,296
Rym: Mmm.".

575
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:37,100
Rym: But at the same time, it doesn't rely on that as the only reason you care about it.

576
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,046
Scott: Yeah, no, the greatness of Cucumber Quest is really just that.

577
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:42,900
Scott: most of the characters are just awesome.

578
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,158
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

579
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:49,060
Rym: Scott, on three, one, two, three, what is your favorite character?

580
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,939
Scott: Anyone that's a crab.

581
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:51,818
Rym: Just the crab bros?

582
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:53,308
Scott: Well, okay, so here's the problem.

583
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,476
Scott: How do I choose, right?

584
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,035
Scott: At first, they come out with these crab mafias, and I'm like, "Crab mafia is the

585
00:27:59,056 --> 00:27:59,239
Scott: best."

586
00:27:59,301 --> 00:27:59,855
Scott: Crab bros.

587
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:08,534
Scott: And then, this crab bro, which is one crab who wears sunglasses, who's, like, deal with it, "I'm crab bro, but I'm the nicest, awesomest dude, but I'm a

588
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:08,839
Scott: bro.".

589
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:18,496
Scott: And then, they got Bubblebeard, the giant crab pirate king, who runs a tropical resort because he's done pirating, and it's like, "How can it be better than

590
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:18,739
Scott: that?".

591
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,639
Scott: Well, crab bro is about equal to that.

592
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:23,379
Scott: And pretty much anyone that's a crab is the best.

593
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,555
Rym: Meanwhile, I'm just a fan of, like, peridot.

594
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:27,940
Rym: Peridot is also awesome.

595
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,140
Rym: More like peridont.

596
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,340
Scott: Yeah, peridot is, like, so awesome.

597
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,140
Rym: She reminds me of the witch girl from the old Game Boy Legend of Zelda.

598
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,600
Scott: Yeah, the ages and seasons.

599
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:40,480
Scott: The only thing wrong with peridot is that she is not a crab.

600
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:48,220
Scott: That is the only thing that keeps her from being tier one is that she does not have two big red claws and a beard made of bubbles.

601
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,299
Rym: I also really like Kyuko's little sister.

602
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:54,054
Scott: Yeah, she's okay.

603
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:54,419
Scott: She's good.

604
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,487
Rym: Well, partly because she's got that very much, like, "Fuck it, I got a sword.

605
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:58,537
Rym: Let's just fucking do this.

606
00:28:58,597 --> 00:28:58,799
Rym: What's

607
00:28:58,819 --> 00:28:58,920
Rym: wrong?".

608
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:13,380
Scott: There are a lot of, like, the main characters from Attack on Titan, right, where the dude is sort of, like, you know, the plot dude, and then the badass, well, Attack on Titan is not actually his sister, but, you know, sort of, like, the sister character.

609
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,500
Scott: The person in that slot is the badass, awesome, sword, stabby, killy person.

610
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,825
Rym: Yep, but what's funny, too, is that- Mikasa, right?

611
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:20,720
Scott: Mikasa and Eren.

612
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,239
Rym: I was reading this, and then, like, relatively recently, I got into the amazing world of Gumball.

613
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:32,260
Rym: In Gumball, the little sister, Anaïs, is a rabbit girl, and her and Almond are extremely similar.

614
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:33,552
Scott: Alrighty.

615
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:35,100
Rym: Which is just kind of interesting.

616
00:29:36,102 --> 00:29:39,800
Rym: I also really like Cucumber's Dad, because you know he's up to something.

617
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:45,878
Scott: Well, it's like Cucumber's Dad started out as, like, his first time I saw him, I was like, "This guy

618
00:29:45,898 --> 00:29:46,180
Scott: sucks.".

619
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,520
Scott: I still don't like him that much, but he's definitely doing something, because he's hanging in that- he's not stupid.

620
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:01,780
Scott: You can tell he's not dumb, and he's hanging out in that prison cell, even though it's locked, and he obviously spied on the bad guys once already.

621
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:05,020
Scott: At the minimum, he's staying there on purpose to spy on the bad guys.

622
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:06,533
Scott: If not more than that.

623
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:07,340
Scott: Right?

624
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:07,818
Rym: Yup.

625
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,039
Scott: And, like, why didn't- he could've messed up those balls, but he chose not to.

626
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,628
Scott: But he knew the deal.

627
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:13,689
Scott: So...

628
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:24,539
Rym: Well, this- it's interesting, because if you read the story, it's pretty much the story of the heroes around their adventure, and all the adults around them know what the deal is and won't tell them.

629
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,600
Scott: Well, the friggin' Oracle, she can go suck a dick.

630
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,733
Rym: Yeah, she's the worst.

631
00:30:28,753 --> 00:30:29,220
Rym: She's mean.

632
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,640
Rym: Well, you know, obviously there's some big plot around that.

633
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,853
Scott: Hey, Auril, why don't you do it yourself?

634
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:36,039
Scott: Don't tell me how to do my job.

635
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:36,576
Rym: Yup.

636
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:37,599
Scott: It's like, what?

637
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,319
Rym: But I like how Nightmare Knight is one of my favorite kinds of villains, because obviously, he's bad.

638
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:44,076
Scott: Oh, yeah.

639
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:54,819
Scott: And even if he is bad for, like, good reasons- It's like, you haven't seen him personally do anything bad, but it's like, he brought back all the masters and told them to do bad stuff, so he's bad.

640
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:07,780
Rym: But he has that sort of, like, bad, sad characteristic of great villains, because obviously he's- Yeah, he's more like a Doctor Doom or a Magneto than just a blow up the world crazy bad guy.

641
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,880
Rym: So you're way behind, but there's a lot of really great interactions between him and other characters along the way.

642
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:20,450
Scott: Well, I got to a part where, towards the end of volume two, the three dumb characters- Oh, those guys.

643
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:21,660
Scott: I hate those guys.

644
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,020
Scott: Well, Bacon's good, but the other two are not so good.

645
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,976
Rym: Bacon's got one star in every attribute.

646
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:26,460
Rym: He's the worst.

647
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:34,190
Scott: Anyway, but the lead of those guys was trying to get kissy kissy on the French princess- Oh, yeah, Nightmare Knight's like- A Nightmare Knight's like, "Yeah, cut that shit out.

648
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,074
Scott: I'm a Nightmare Knight.

649
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:35,697
Scott: Do what I

650
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:36,019
Scott: say.".

651
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,800
Rym: So there is a continuing relationship between him and Parfait.

652
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:42,659
Rym: that's just really, really fun.

653
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,252
Scott: Oh, I hope that they get it on and kick a carrot at- What's his name?

654
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:47,620
Scott: Carrot?

655
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,086
Rym: Carrot's not bad.

656
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:52,300
Rym: He's just really, really earnest.

657
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,859
Scott: Listen, Parfait and Nightmare Knight would be way better than- Oh, Parfait and Nightmare Knight's a pretty good ship.

658
00:31:57,141 --> 00:32:00,256
Scott: Right, but forget Carrot and Parfait, the canon one.

659
00:32:00,296 --> 00:32:01,160
Scott: Fuck that relationship.

660
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:09,040
Rym: I like Queen Cordelia, too, because the sort of initial "baddie" is basically a lot like Queen Beryl in Sailor Moon.

661
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,840
Rym: You said- I really- I loved interviews- She's better than Queen Beryl.

662
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,739
Rym: But in terms of- you don't know Queen Beryl's full story, so I can't really spoil anything, but she's- I don't give a shit.

663
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,340
Rym: She's obviously trying to play two sides of a coin and failing at it.

664
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:24,303
Scott: But it's like.

665
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:30,979
Scott: she's also bad, but she's not stupid bad, and she's not crazy bad.

666
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,640
Scott: She's just, you know, sort of, you know, naughty.

667
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:38,039
Rym: That's not how I would describe it, but I see.

668
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:41,119
Rym: Well, you know, it's one of those Queen Beryl's trying to-.

669
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,054
Rym: Well, I'm not going to spoil Sailor Moon.

670
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:43,900
Rym: We'll talk about that later.

671
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,560
Scott: Actually, I think that- who's the guy who made the boat that exploded or whatever?

672
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:49,978
Rym: Oh, that guy!

673
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,740
Scott: He's actually the baddest, right?

674
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,760
Scott: In terms of, like, attitude and personality, he is the most evil, I think.

675
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:57,438
Scott: I don't know.

676
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,465
Scott: I do like that.

677
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:03,136
Rym: he's all technology-y, but other than that- I don't know if it's just the face or what, but whenever I see him, he's no good.

678
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,478
Rym: I think, just without any question, my brain is like, "Is that George

679
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:07,839
Rym: Rohek?"

680
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:08,669
Rym: And I'm like, "No, it's

681
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:08,912
Rym: not.".

682
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:13,040
Scott: Anyway, so short plot summary, right?

683
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,460
Scott: He wants- the kid, Cucumber, wants to go to wizard school, the best wizard school in the land.

684
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:18,660
Scott: He's going to go tomorrow.

685
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:28,860
Scott: But then, suddenly, that's when the bad guys decide to resurrect the great evil, and his dad is like, "Well, you have to be the chosen one because it runs in our family, so go get the sword and do it.

686
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,029
Scott: Go on the adventure.

687
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:30,575
Scott: Go do it

688
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:30,818
Scott: now.".

689
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:34,679
Scott: He's basically ordered to go on the adventure, even though his sister's probably really the hero.

690
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,068
Scott: Yeah.

691
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,419
Scott: But he has to do it anyway.

692
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:45,297
Scott: So he starts going on the adventure, and the adventure is basically get the dream sword, magic sword, secret of mana sword, master sword.

693
00:33:46,822 --> 00:33:56,840
Scott: And then beat all eight robot masters, I mean, regular masters of evil, starting with the spla- you know, there's one in each kingdom, so you have to go to all the- The disaster masters!

694
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:19,998
Scott: Right, you have to go to every kingdom in the whole world, meet all the characters, meet all the princesses and people that live in every place, create an awesome adventuring party, collect the items on the quest of magic, learn things and grow up and become awesome and beat these masters, and then come back to the central kingdom and beat the final bad guy, and then everything will be revealed at the end, all the secrets and the webcomic will end at the end.

695
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,056
Rym: Yep, so RPG world, RPG plot.

696
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:34,520
Scott: Yeah, so it doesn't really matter, the plot, it's all about- because it's such a straightforward plot, it's all about the details of each situation and what the characters are doing.

697
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:36,759
Rym: And I guess that's where it really shines.

698
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,879
Scott: And of course, what the final deal is.

699
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:52,795
Scott: Why is this- we've seen this cliche story a zillion times before, but here the characters are openly recognizing that there has been a pattern that's repeated a hundred times of- Well, 99 times.

700
00:34:53,179 --> 00:35:04,000
Scott: Right, 99 times, summoning, and then temporarily banishing the nightmare knight, and it has to be at the end of this hundredth time that they're going to figure out the real deal.

701
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:13,238
Scott: Well, it could go a fire emblem route, like it could go a route of, like, is the story- Well, they could, A, realize why it has to be this way and just do it the way it's always been done.

702
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:21,380
Scott: B, see the way it's always been done and figure out some way around it, and what that way around it is then becomes important.

703
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,559
Scott: Is the way around it- Don't banish him.

704
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,220
Rym: Is it a Shinseke Iori sort of, like, come of age in a new world and understand it for what it is?

705
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,316
Rym: You know, basically, is the end cucumber and everyone's saying, "Okay, we understand what the adults are all

706
00:35:34,357 --> 00:35:34,639
Rym: about."

707
00:35:35,484 --> 00:35:36,500
Rym: Or, mole breaker.

708
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:39,500
Scott: It could banish him for real, permanently.

709
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:40,137
Scott: Kill him.

710
00:35:40,461 --> 00:35:42,553
Scott: And then it's like, "Oh, the sister was actually the hero.

711
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:43,780
Scott: You get to go to wizard school.

712
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,630
Scott: Oh, you don't need to go to wizard school because you already became a wizard on this quest, so now you're in charge of wizard school.

713
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:50,274
Scott: You're the new

714
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:50,777
Scott: king.".

715
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:53,399
Scott: You know, stuff like that can happen at the end.

716
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,739
Rym: The other interesting thing is that the characters and just the story and the setting and things very commonly surprise me.

717
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:02,874
Rym: Every time I think, "Okay, I see where this is

718
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:03,217
Rym: going.".

719
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,519
Rym: Nope, nope, something crazy happens.

720
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:08,480
Rym: So, I don't know what else I can say.

721
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,445
Rym: It's a webcomic.

722
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:11,013
Rym: You can just read it for free.

723
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:12,320
Rym: You don't need to buy anything.

724
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,424
Scott: Well, you can.

725
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,500
Scott: You should buy the books because the books have extra shit in them and they're Kickstarted.

726
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,290
Scott: I'm sure you can get the old volumes.

727
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:20,459
Scott: It can't be that hard to get them.

728
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:24,120
Scott: But, if you get the old volumes, then you can start doing what I'm doing.

729
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,600
Scott: Just Kickstart each volume as it comes out.

730
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,000
Rym: You can do that.

731
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,980
Scott: And then, if you pay more money than I'm paying, because I'm only paying the book level, if you pay more levels, you can get more stuff.

732
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,798
Rym: But, I guess, put it this way.

733
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:37,680
Rym: If you're not sold on this by our unabashed joy about just talking about it...

734
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,519
Scott: You can read the webcomic for free to figure out.

735
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,980
Rym: Yeah, go read the first bit.

736
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,719
Scott: So, click on "Shop" and see if they're selling the books.

737
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,651
Rym: Oh, let's see.

738
00:36:43,855 --> 00:36:44,060
Rym: "Shop.".

739
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,079
Scott: Oh, are they selling any other merch?

740
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,210
Scott: Yeah, there it is.

741
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:46,880
Scott: Volume 1.

742
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,988
Rym: "Disaster Stone Pins," "Print Sets,".

743
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:49,610
Rym: "Print Set,".

744
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,239
Rym: "Print Set," "Group Print," "Cucumber

745
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:52,360
Rym: Dress.".

746
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,319
Scott: How much are the volumes?

747
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,624
Rym: Sold out.

748
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:55,819
Rym: A lot of these things are sold out.

749
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,457
Scott: How much are the volumes?

750
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,160
Rym: Hardcover of book 1, $65.

751
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,886
Rym: Softcover of book 1, $20.

752
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:03,040
Scott: Alright.

753
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:03,517
Scott: Yeah.

754
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,687
Scott: There you go.

755
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:05,679
Scott: I wouldn't get the hardcover one.

756
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,188
Rym: I don't know.

757
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:06,580
Rym: It depends.

758
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:07,145
Scott: You're gonna pay $65?

759
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:07,549
Scott: I don't think so.

760
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,540
Rym: It depends on how into it you get.

761
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,679
Scott: You gotta be way into it to need that.

762
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:17,879
Scott: For $65, you could get three volumes instead of one volume.

763
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:20,360
Rym: Well, that depends on how into it you get.

764
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:21,599
Scott: How into it are you?

765
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:23,515
Rym: I really like "Cucumber

766
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:23,858
Rym: Quest.".

767
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:24,539
Scott: Yeah, it's good.

768
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,860
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

769
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,980
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

770
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:43,400
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

771
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,320
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

772
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:51,040
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

773

774
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,880
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

775
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,000
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

776
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:23,946
Scott: (singing in Italian).
