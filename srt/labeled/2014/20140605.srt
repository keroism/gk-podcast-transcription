1
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,730
Rym: It's Wednesday, June 4th, 2014.

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,557
Rym: I'm Rym, and this is GeekNights.

3
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:18,425
Rym: Tonight, Ghost in the Shell Arise.

4
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:21,115
Rym: Or at least the first two episodes.

5
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:22,299
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,742 --> 00:00:31,600
Rym: So we got to see Takashi Murakami's jellyfish eyes.

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,948
Scott: Yeah, so basically it was really weird.

8
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:37,308
Scott: So if you don't know, there's two Murakamis and people get them confused.

9
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:37,994
Rym: Yeah, there's the 1Q84.

10
00:00:39,262 --> 00:00:40,890
Scott: The author Haruki Murakami.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,980
Rym: But no, we're talking about super flat Murakami.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,200
Scott: Right, the guy we went to see his art exhibit in Brooklyn some years ago.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,186
Rym: Yep, that was when we learned that most of the people in the world that we know were slow walkers.

14
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:59,068
Scott: Anyway, so he was coming to the city because he made a movie, and I was like, "Well, I don't care what that movie is, he made it and he's going to be there, so I want to go to

15
00:00:59,109 --> 00:00:59,310
Scott: that.".

16
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:03,673
Scott: I tried to buy tickets and their website basically didn't work because I said, "Oh well, I guess I didn't get

17
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:04,075
Scott: tickets.".

18
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,327
Scott: And then I checked my credit card statement at the end of the month and they charged me money, and I was like, "Hey, what the

19
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:09,629
Scott: hell?".

20
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,911
Scott: So I called the box office and was like, "You charged me money for a thing I didn't get tickets

21
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:14,072
Scott: to.".

22
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:14,796
Scott: They said, "You did get

23
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:15,198
Scott: tickets.".

24
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:17,609
Scott: I'm like, "Oh shit, this thing is in like two days.

25
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:18,954
Scott: I'm glad I checked with

26
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:19,135
Scott: you.".

27
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:21,126
Scott: So we went to see it.

28
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:22,617
Rym: Yeah, it was crazy sold out.

29
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:27,959
Rym: There were like a hundred people hanging around hoping to get in on standby, and he was there.

30
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,379
Rym: Like we walk in, Scott and our friends Phil and James do.

31
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:36,949
Scott: I mostly wanted to go because I knew the movie Good or Bad was going to look crazy because he made it.

32
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:37,619
Rym: And it did.

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,140
Scott: And I knew that I wanted to see what this guy was like because his art is crazy.

34
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:47,847
Rym: So we're not going to do too much of an in-depth review just because a movie like this, just go see it.

35
00:01:47,948 --> 00:01:48,959
Scott: Well, how are you going to see it?

36
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,240
Rym: I'm sure there will be a way to see it at some point.

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,635
Scott: It's going to be a while before you have a chance to see it.

38
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:55,404
Scott: I mean, I don't think it's on the internet yet.

39
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:57,593
Rym: But it is beautiful.

40
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:58,718
Rym: I will say that.

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,271
Rym: It is absolutely beautiful the way it's filmed.

42
00:02:01,552 --> 00:02:04,806
Rym: The compositing is really good except for some of the weird fights at the end.

43
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:11,820
Rym: The characters are actually really cute and weird except the one guy who just looks like a dude in a costume.

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,185
Scott: You don't like Luxor?

45
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:19,129
Rym: Well, Luxor's size is proportionate to the sadness and the heart of that little girl.

46
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:19,631
Rym: Sure.

47
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:23,027
Scott: I think Luxor might actually be the best one in my book.

48
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:24,455
Rym: I don't know.

49
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,714
Rym: The jellyfish dude was pretty cool because he was the most badass.

50
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:28,660
Rym: What about Coco?

51
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:30,164
Scott: The monkey?

52
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,007
Scott: No.

53
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:33,679
Rym: Coco was the fighting game girl.

54
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:37,360
Rym: Oh, well that's- Co to the second power, Coco.

55
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,425
Scott: Yeah, no.

56
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:42,753
Rym: I guess that kid was sadder than the girl who had Luxor because he had like a million Pokemon.

57
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,000
Rym: He was the hikikomori.

58
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,711
Rym: Yeah.

59
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:44,958
Scott: Yeah.

60
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:46,222
Rym: I don't know.

61
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:49,955
Rym: This movie, it started out like it was going to be ET.

62
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:55,820
Rym: You know, kid finds a weird thing, hiding it from his parents, but then it immediately turns into Pokemon.

63
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,846
Scott: And then it turns into Godzilla.

64
00:02:58,127 --> 00:02:58,950
Rym: Yup, pretty much.

65
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:06,922
Rym: And the good things I can say about it, it was beautiful and weird and I actually was surprised by it at a number of points.

66
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:11,657
Rym: The bad things I can say about it, the child actors were kind of bad.

67
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:15,251
Rym: The story was pretty dumb in the end.

68
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:17,843
Scott: It was like a typical live action Japanese kids movie.

69
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:18,165
Rym: Yup.

70
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:21,200
Rym: It reminded me a lot of actually Juvenile.

71
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,946
Scott: Yeah, pretty similar.

72
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:27,589
Scott: Except without the, this also had the Godzilla listening to this knows what the fuck Juvenile.

73
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,956
Rym: Oh my God, Juvenile.

74
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:30,108
Rym: We should do a show on that.

75
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:30,580
Rym: Yeah.

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,586
Rym: I'd have to watch it again.

77
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:33,340
Rym: How'd we even fucking get that?

78
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:34,713
Scott: It was on some random tape.

79
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:35,259
Rym: Yup.

80
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,747
Scott: In the anime club or some shit.

81
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,841
Rym: We just saw this VHS tape and it was labeled Juvenile.

82
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:41,326
Rym: We're like, what the fuck is that?

83
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,980
Rym: It's actually just Japanese ET.

84
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:47,936
Scott: Sure.

85
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:48,280
Rym: Basically.

86
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:48,840
Rym: Yup.

87
00:03:49,867 --> 00:04:06,441
Rym: But yeah, this thing was just, it has kind of this ham fisted Fukushima sort of metaphor allegory about you have to have optimism and there's sadness and coming of age and there's a lot of ideas sort of just mishmash together into it.

88
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:17,856
Rym: So I can't say that it was good, but it was definitely enjoyable, but you got to enjoy some parts of it from the perspective of why is that cultist so angry?

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,862
Rym: He got what he wanted.

90
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:21,348
Rym: None of the other cultists are angry.

91
00:04:21,368 --> 00:04:24,982
Scott: Uh, I guess in other news, there's other news.

92
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:25,706
Rym: Not really.

93
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:26,168
Scott: There is.

94
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:33,169
Scott: There's hardly any news, but I just wanted to remind people number one, saga volume three should be out now, right?

95
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:44,359
Scott: And two, uh, at this as of like some days ago, maybe even a week ago, the last episode of Gundam UC unicorn is out.

96
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,888
Rym: But anyway, things of the day.

97
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,054
Rym: So this is pretty chill.

98
00:04:55,094 --> 00:05:05,556
Rym: This is basically one of those things where it's two cultures that aren't United States slash English speaking Western world and commentary on each other, which is the kind of thing I always like.

99
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:19,224
Rym: So it's the guy who's Malaysian, speaks Malaysian, speaks Japanese, and he's explaining mostly for the benefit of other people who aren't necessarily us about Japanese phrases and Japanese sayings.

100
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,812
Rym: and Japanese people do like this.

101
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:23,765
Rym: That's, this is, it's very different from how Malaysian people do.

102
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:32,574
Rym: And the best of his videos, I'll link to both of them cause they're pretty great is how does, how to use high like a Japanese.

103
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:33,456
Rym: Okay.

104
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:35,722
Rym: And the four levels of the Japanese.

105
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:40,675
Rym: Hey, Hey, Hey, it's really good.

106
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:41,657
Rym: It's really good.

107
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:43,784
Rym: Especially if you don't speak Japanese.

108
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:46,274
Rym: that well, but you watch a lot of anime.

109
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,248
Rym: If you watch these videos, you'll be like, ah, I get it.

110
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,555
Scott: I think you sort of naturally get it.

111
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:55,966
Scott: I feel like I already know the four levels of A.

112
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:56,989
Rym: You'd think so.

113
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,363
Rym: The more, uh, important or dangerous ones are actually shorter.

114
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:03,508
Rym: All right.

115
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,934
Rym: Hey has a profound theory.

116
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:09,182
Scott: So you remember retro game master.

117
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:11,432
Rym: Do I ever game center CX?

118
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:14,484
Scott: Did you know that it was a retro game challenge too for the Nintendo DS?

119
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:15,447
Rym: What?

120
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:16,371
Rym: Why don't I own that?

121
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:20,126
Scott: Because it never was and probably never will be released in English.

122
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:20,688
Rym: Fuck.

123
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,632
Rym: I'll just play it in Japanese.

124
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:21,994
Rym: Whatever.

125
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:30,419
Scott: Well, you might be excited to know some fans just came out a few days ago with a translation patch.

126
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:30,779
Rym: Wow.

127
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:35,412
Scott: Get your DS emulators or DS piracy cards all fixed up.

128
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:38,602
Scott: Patch that ROM and play the game center.

129
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:39,907
Rym: That takes me back.

130
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:47,131
Rym: It takes me back to a day when I discovered final fantasy five and I had a ROM of it, but it was in Japanese.

131
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:53,571
Rym: Then I found a patch that made that ROM in English and oh fuck did I play that game.

132
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:58,788
Rym: and also fuck did the translation not just sort of Peter out about two thirds of the way through.

133
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:04,851
Rym: It just that all the words got replaced with like sword icons and gibberish.

134
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:05,353
Scott: Yep.

135
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:07,000
Rym: So as a result, I never beat that game.

136
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,444
Rym: Also fuck the shield dragon.

137
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:10,791
Scott: Meta moments.

138
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,720
Rym: Book Club book is identical for Lebowitz.

139
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,906
Scott: I read like a chapter and then stop.

140
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:20,060
Rym: precursor book, the proto culture book to all the like.

141
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,417
Rym: post apocalypse survival in a place with a color system books we've read.

142
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:28,834
Scott: If anyone knows an earlier store instance of that story, please tell it to us.

143
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:35,539
Rym: Wikipedia lists a few, but I think this one is the beginning of the modern era of post apocalypse survival.

144
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:40,337
Scott: Well, something I realized is even the idea of a manmade apocalypse, right?

145
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:41,461
Scott: I mean, it's Noah's arc, right?

146
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:43,429
Scott: But the idea wasn't made by man.

147
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,823
Scott: No, as I'm saying is that apocalypse is in general Noah's arc, right?

148
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,152
Scott: Or maybe even older than that, but right.

149
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:49,674
Scott: Right.

150
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:52,805
Scott: The idea of a manmade apocalypse, right?

151
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:59,913
Scott: Didn't even, it wasn't even conceivable to people because we didn't have any things that could possibly do that.

152
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:00,958
Rym: Well, imagine you're Roman.

153
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:03,348
Rym: You're like, all right, what do we do?

154
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:06,140
Rym: Just start stabbing the earth and keep stabbing it until it dies.

155
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,581
Scott: Right?

156
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:10,217
Scott: It's like other than something that comes from God or nature or whatever, right?

157
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,906
Scott: I got a God or nature, whatever.

158
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:19,110
Scott: the only, we couldn't even conceive of a manmade apocalypse until we invented nuclear weapons, right?

159
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:26,377
Scott: So this kind of story didn't really exist until we invented nuclear weapons, which was less than a century ago.

160
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:31,297
Rym: And funnily enough, most of the post-apocalypses in these stores are caused by nuclear weapons.

161
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:36,514
Rym: You don't say occasionally get the biological weapon, the zombie, right?

162
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:42,221
Scott: Well, the only, the only stories that are otherwise are stuff like cat's cradle where someone makes up something fictional, right?

163
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:42,904
Scott: Like ice nine.

164
00:08:42,924 --> 00:08:44,187
Rym: Oh yeah.

165
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:44,589
Rym: Yep.

166
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:47,939
Rym: In other news, you should join us at Connecticut.

167
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,851
Rym: Second week of June and the weekend, I think it's the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th.

168
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:55,628
Rym: Uh, Connecticut con is not better than PAX Prime.

169
00:08:55,969 --> 00:09:00,845
Rym: No, it's not better than magfest unless you're into anything other than gaming.

170
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:01,307
Scott: Yeah.

171
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,785
Rym: And it's a better gaming con than almost every gaming con in the United States.

172
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:07,391
Rym: All rolled into one.

173
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:11,768
Rym: So as we've said before, you know, we, we run the panels and workshops department.

174
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,812
Rym: So we scheduled a, I think a pretty bad ass schedule of panels and lectures and workshops and stuff.

175
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:17,375
Scott: You know what?

176
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:21,070
Scott: It might be the best panels and lectures period at any con.

177
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:31,880
Scott: Yeah, it might be actually, I think, I think we pretty much, you know, our department, you know, not to be all self aggrandizing, but I think about the panels and lectures departments of other cons and their schedules.

178
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:36,357
Scott: and it's like the big cons, mostly of industry panels, which are boring as hell.

179
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,335
Scott: And the small cons just, you know, either they have rain bro dash, right?

180
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:46,576
Scott: And then the other cons like anime Boston, like it's really good, but it's anime only Connecticut con.

181
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:50,149
Scott: We got panels on everything of the highest quality.

182
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,824
Rym: Absolutely everything except we don't have anything on the demo scenes.

183
00:09:54,904 --> 00:10:00,664
Scott: So email us, uh, other meta things you should go and find us on the internet.

184
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:10,380
Scott: I mean, if you're listening to this, you probably already have, but we have many places on the internet, Twitter, IRC, newsletter, forum, Facebook's got pluses.

185
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:11,144
Scott: We have everything.

186
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:15,646
Rym: I feel like we should put that part at the end and the closer as opposed to in the meta moment.

187
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:18,077
Scott: No people probably turn off the podcast by then.

188
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:20,107
Rym: So somebody listens for the first time though.

189
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:21,997
Rym: might listen to that cause it's explained some stuff.

190
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,043
Scott: Maybe I don't know.

191
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:23,988
Rym: I don't know guys.

192
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:24,832
Rym: I'll say this.

193
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,199
Rym: I'm going to highlight one thing.

194
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:36,865
Rym: If you're going to interact with us in any way, the best way to do that right now is to share our shit on Reddit because Reddit won't let you put your own stuff up and people are really weird about that on Reddit.

195
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,591
Rym: So it's up to you.

196
00:10:39,193 --> 00:10:42,686
Rym: The more popular you make our videos, the more videos we'll do.

197
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:43,048
Scott: Right.

198
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:43,449
Scott: Go.

199
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,285
Scott: We need a people who like us to go and promote us because at least on Reddit.

200
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:47,727
Rym: Yeah.

201
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,274
Scott: It's hard to do otherwise.

202
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:51,805
Scott: Maybe we should use our project wonderful money to buy some ads.

203
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:52,468
Scott: I don't know.

204
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:56,724
Rym: We just need someone to pay someone else to post our stuff on Reddit.

205
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:57,165
Scott: Sure.

206
00:10:57,868 --> 00:10:59,674
Scott: Make a new account, fake account, whatever.

207
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:00,357
Scott: Yeah.

208
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:01,661
Rym: GeekNights.

209
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:03,446
Rym: Fuck.

210
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:04,208
Rym: I already fucked it up.

211
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:04,569
Rym: Yeah.

212
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:05,291
Scott: Whatever.

213
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:12,772
Rym: So pretty much since standalone complex second gig and then the, uh, pretty okay.

214
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:14,657
Rym: Solid state society OAV came out.

215
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:16,884
Rym: Uh, I've modicum magic.

216
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:17,406
Rym: It was great.

217
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:24,716
Rym: I really enjoyed Kill La Kill, but all I really want out of anime is more ghost in the shell standalone complex.

218
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:28,030
Scott: Well, they're not going to get more of that, but you will get more ghosts in the shell.

219
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:28,934
Scott: In fact, we just did.

220
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:29,818
Rym: Yep.

221
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:35,097
Rym: And it's the closest thing to standalone complex that has come out since standalone complex.

222
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,788
Scott: It's the only ghost in the shell that's come out.

223
00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:42,707
Rym: Yes, but there have been no other anime that scratched that itch at all.

224
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,998
Rym: This is the only anime that scratches that.

225
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:50,974
Scott: Some people would make some animes or mangas in a ghost in the shell ish cyberpunk genre.

226
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:51,235
Rym: Yeah.

227
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,526
Rym: It's not a dystopia ghost in the show.

228
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:55,750
Rym: It's not a utopia.

229
00:11:56,091 --> 00:12:01,468
Rym: It's just kind of a realistic future of cyber tech and cyberspace and all that stuff.

230
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,080
Rym: But at the same time, procedural police drama.

231
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:05,580
Scott: Yep.

232
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:09,434
Rym: So not going to spoil a million things.

233
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:12,907
Rym: Let's spoil a few things because we didn't see all of a rise.

234
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:14,071
Scott: It's not all out yet.

235
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:15,396
Scott: Much like Gundam unicorn.

236
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:19,614
Scott: I was originally going to wait until all of it was out and then watch it all at once.

237
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:20,277
Scott: But you know what?

238
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,844
Scott: They went and put episodes one and two, uh, in a theater in New York city and I'm like, well, might as well go see it.

239
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:28,331
Scott: And I went to see it.

240
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:29,195
Rym: And you know what?

241
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:32,810
Rym: I'm glad we watched it on the big screen because it was really loud.

242
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,436
Rym: It wasn't that loud.

243
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:44,703
Rym: I've been in louder theaters where the plot of a ghost in the shell standalone complex season would encompass, you know, a certain thing.

244
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:45,828
Rym: Like there's a politician.

245
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:46,892
Rym: We finally bring him down.

246
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:56,305
Scott: Every episode of this has about the same amount of plots, but there's also this sort of a overarching plot to the whole thing, right?

247
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:56,767
Scott: Yeah.

248
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:58,734
Scott: Formation of section nine and whatnot.

249
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:04,520
Rym: Well, of course we know pretty much the gist of it, at least from all the other ghosts in the shell media.

250
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:04,861
Scott: Right.

251
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:09,222
Scott: But you're getting all these details that may or may not conflict with previous camera.

252
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:15,260
Rym: It already conflicts a couple of times in tone with a standalone complexes backstories.

253
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:15,781
Scott: Yeah.

254
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:16,967
Scott: And some of the characters are different.

255
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:21,346
Scott: Like Saito is pretty excitable, but complex is super serious.

256
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:24,098
Rym: Excitable is probably the best way to describe it, right?

257
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:27,335
Scott: But he's super serious in standalone complex and other ghosts in the shells.

258
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:28,943
Scott: It's like, why did they change his personality?

259
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:31,796
Scott: Or maybe he's just going to show us his personality changing.

260
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:38,243
Scott: But no, because there was a flashback in standalone complex that showed him in the past being super serious.

261
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,308
Scott: So it doesn't make sense.

262
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:39,830
Scott: Right.

263
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:40,915
Scott: That's just one example.

264
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:43,425
Scott: But other things are perfectly match of the canon.

265
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:46,779
Scott: Like Toga is a detective and he's getting noticed.

266
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,100
Scott: Right.

267
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:49,832
Scott: And probably, you know, that's probably going to match up really well.

268
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:53,829
Scott: And, you know, bottles is a ranger and he seems pretty similar to.

269
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,291
Rym: Yep.

270
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:58,427
Rym: But everyone's definitely their younger self like they have more energy.

271
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:05,331
Rym: They're they're surprisingly all kind of snarky with each other and they all mostly know who each other are.

272
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:10,107
Rym: Like they're all kind of famous or infamous within their various spheres.

273
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:10,368
Scott: Right.

274
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:14,343
Scott: Well, it's like, you know, say John Carmack's walking down the road.

275
00:14:14,484 --> 00:14:15,834
Scott: Most people are not going to know who he is.

276
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,366
Scott: And if he opens his mouth, people are going to be like, oh, it's Professor Frank.

277
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,434
Scott: Yeah, he talks.

278
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:26,119
Scott: But if we see him walking down the road, I'd be like, whoa, it's a John Carmack over there in our industry.

279
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:26,340
Scott: Right.

280
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,822
Scott: So these people are all in, you know, the military, you know, law enforcement, you know, industry.

281
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,753
Scott: So they know each other because they're all infamous badasses.

282
00:14:36,696 --> 00:14:46,695
Rym: So the interesting thing, though, is that at least because every episode is pretty much standalone as a movie, even though it kind of reveals the greater world, you can't just go watch an episode.

283
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,748
Rym: I wasn't going to say watch them out of order.

284
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,624
Rym: I'm saying you can watch one episode and be totally satisfied.

285
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:53,427
Scott: Yeah, you can do that.

286
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:56,019
Rym: You don't need to wait for the next episode to come out.

287
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,024
Rym: There are no cliffhangers.

288
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:58,109
Scott: There's no cliffhangers.

289
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:58,390
Scott: Right.

290
00:14:58,853 --> 00:14:59,074
Scott: Yeah.

291
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:01,243
Scott: It was each one is like a whole movie's worth.

292
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:01,725
Scott: Right.

293
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:02,467
Scott: It resolves.

294
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,374
Scott: So, you know, there isn't.

295
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:08,229
Scott: there isn't like, well, you know, continued in the next episode or anything like that.

296
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:20,172
Rym: So if you're a fan of standalone complex, like the previous sets of Ghost in the Shell, what I would say is primarily different is that the world is much freer with crazy military technology.

297
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:30,663
Rym: I don't know if that's to a greater point, like society is still a little lawless or there's still a lot of military hardware hanging around after the war.

298
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:39,228
Rym: But I mean, in early episodes, bad guys have like military tanks and military shit and they're just blowing things up.

299
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,074
Rym: Landmines everywhere.

300
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:43,704
Rym: Oh, landmines look like prepubescent girls.

301
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:43,885
Scott: Yeah.

302
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:50,114
Scott: You know, maybe that could actually be a result of, you know, well, first of all, the political situation in the country at the time.

303
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:50,817
Scott: Right.

304
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:53,872
Scott: You know, they talk a bit about, you know, how things are kind of unstable.

305
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:57,892
Rym: Well, I mean, the military is getting reorganized, which is like the backdrop for everything.

306
00:15:57,912 --> 00:15:58,374
Rym: Right.

307
00:15:58,535 --> 00:16:01,126
Rym: Every military group is basically trying to protect itself.

308
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:03,255
Rym: A lot of people committed war crimes.

309
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:05,425
Rym: It's shady shit during the actual war.

310
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:05,626
Rym: Right.

311
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:17,997
Scott: And you could almost, you know, say that, you know, all the difference in the world here in Arise versus the difference in standalone conflicts and other Ghost in the Shells is, you know, the results of the work of Section 9.

312
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:18,197
Scott: Right.

313
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,503
Scott: It's like they did a good job.

314
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:30,090
Scott: Therefore, things became this way because watching this only then the cyber crimes they have to deal with are, you know, the only ones that are left are like super high level, amazing people hidden deep in the net.

315
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,410
Scott: And all the things on the service level have sort of cleaned up, you know, by the major and team.

316
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:34,792
Rym: Yeah.

317
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:41,275
Rym: But it's interesting how pointed all of that is like the backdrop really fits with the way this show is working.

318
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:43,925
Rym: Violence is the answer much more readily.

319
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:47,380
Rym: And the plots are actually pretty straightforward because everyone's corrupt.

320
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:55,392
Rym: I mean, when the major tricks the one politician in the car to spill in the beans, his beans are the smallest of beans.

321
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:57,560
Rym: And it seems like everybody has a lot of beans.

322
00:16:58,641 --> 00:16:59,323
Rym: Everybody.

323
00:16:59,343 --> 00:17:00,948
Rym: Yeah.

324
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,238
Rym: Granted, all they had to do was find the other coffin.

325
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:04,940
Rym: They would have been good.

326
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,560
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:07,267
Scott: Well, it's not easy to find.

328
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:08,210
Scott: It was right there.

329
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,319
Rym: I carried this coffin around with me.

330
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:17,444
Rym: I'm working on a meme mashup with that guy from Cowboy Bebop and this episode.

331
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,851
Scott: How about also some Trigun in there?

332
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:20,773
Rym: Oh, yeah.

333
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:27,400
Rym: I could get to Mid Valley, not Mid Valley Horn Freak, Legato Blue Summers and carrying that coffin.

334
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:30,191
Rym: Man, the Trigun manga is pretty fun.

335
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:35,633
Scott: And you could also put in, maybe you could mix in the grave in Fist of the North Star.

336
00:17:35,673 --> 00:17:37,240
Scott: He's like, I dug this grave.

337
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,725
Scott: He's going to make him fit in it.

338
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:42,296
Rym: We'll see.

339
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:43,320
Rym: I got to put that thing together.

340
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,181
Rym: Yeah.

341
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:56,836
Rym: The major is interesting in that she's still very recognizably her character, but she's a lot more openly surly and a lot more direct.

342
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,239
Rym: She finds out a thing.

343
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:00,845
Rym: She goes immediately straight at that thing.

344
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,053
Rym: Also, she gets hacked.

345
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:05,176
Rym: She's not 100% yet.

346
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,683
Rym: She's not the goddess of hacking yet.

347
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:16,460
Scott: Well, the body that she has here is not the body that she has for, I guess, the cyborg body that she has for most of the Ghost in the Shell story.

348
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,870
Rym: Not the crazy military body.

349
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,152
Rym: Right.

350
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:21,971
Scott: It's not like she doesn't have the guns coming out of her arms and shit or anything like that.

351
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:22,332
Scott: Right.

352
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:26,912
Scott: It's just sort of a really good cyborg body she got from when she was in the military.

353
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:29,042
Scott: And at the start, the military still owns it.

354
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:29,625
Scott: Right.

355
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:30,168
Rym: Yeah.

356
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,238
Rym: In fact, the show makes a big deal about that too.

357
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:39,943
Rym: They have all these nice subtle touches about how basically full body cyborgs are not really a thing outside of the military.

358
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,271
Rym: People don't...

359
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,919
Scott: Even in other Ghost in the Shells, it's like no one can afford that.

360
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,722
Scott: Yeah.

361
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:46,827
Rym: Ultra rich people can.

362
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:48,272
Rym: It's out there.

363
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:52,008
Scott: I mean, that's why you have people like even someone who owns a company like Jameson.

364
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,571
Scott: Right.

365
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:54,480
Scott: He's in a little tiny box because...

366
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,669
Rym: Well, he prefers that body.

367
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,920
Scott: I'm just saying, but that's the why.

368
00:18:58,023 --> 00:19:00,353
Scott: If they do have a full body cyborg, they don't have a good one.

369
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:04,712
Scott: It's not like the fact that the major is... That's true through all Ghost in the Shell.

370
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:04,953
Scott: Right.

371
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:08,909
Scott: That she basically always has the best possible cyborg body.

372
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,034
Scott: that's a full cyborg body.

373
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:10,937
Scott: No one could even tell.

374
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,846
Scott: They'd be like, "Whoa, that's a full cyborg body.

375
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:13,228
Scott: Holy

376
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:13,609
Scott: shit.".

377
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:14,273
Scott: Right?

378
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:16,384
Scott: Because most full cyborg bodies are really crappy.

379
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:28,742
Rym: But as a result, we get this interesting thing that actually fits with the old shows where they're really worried about personal freedom and personal attitude and the ability to fight for what they want and whatever and not being beholden to anyone except by consent.

380
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:34,215
Scott: And control by being hacked because you have a computer.

381
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:44,905
Rym: But in this one, there's all these characters want something and can't go after it because they work within an organization that's hobbled by bureaucracy.

382
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:58,388
Rym: And basically, the story of Ghost in the Shell is, as it's always been, all the people who want justice and who are smart, band together to semi-legally pursue justice and do that via Batman.

383
00:19:58,408 --> 00:19:59,110
Rym: Cyber Batman.

384
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:02,262
Rym: Yes.

385
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,169
Rym: That is the plot of Ghost in the Shell.

386
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,337
Rym: But with a rise, it is open.

387
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:07,300
Rym: It is out there.

388
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:09,485
Rym: That is what they are doing.

389
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:10,748
Rym: A hundred percent.

390
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:14,616
Rym: The show is also ultra, ultra action.

391
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,160
Rym: Very little.

392
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,799
Scott: I think because it's an OAV, because you're getting so much time in there, right?

393
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,610
Scott: It's like they got to fill it with awesome action scenes.

394
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:23,395
Scott: You have a big budget.

395
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:24,040
Scott: How do you blow it?

396
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,975
Rym: And I think, apparently, in every episode, they're going to spend a lot of detail on one of the major's arms being blown off.

397
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:31,900
Scott: That's how it goes.

398
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:33,474
Rym: Two episodes in a row.

399
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:33,940
Rym: Boom.

400
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,473
Rym: But everyone's bodies get injured a lot.

401
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:43,020
Scott: But when you have several bodies, that's something you can do that you couldn't do otherwise.

402
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,162
Scott: So true.

403
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:50,927
Rym: But in standalone complex, when someone needs to replace a part of their body, that's a big goddamn deal.

404
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:53,075
Rym: And it kind of hobbles them for a while.

405
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:57,609
Rym: And in this OAV, they pretty much are immediately fine.

406
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:14,707
Scott: Yeah, I think the major difference between this and the other Ghost in the Shells is that the, you know, the original Ghost in the Shell movie and even standalone complex, right, sort of has this really mysterious kind of thing like, ooh, what's going on in the net?

407
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:16,533
Scott: Who's the laughing man?

408
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:22,676
Scott: And it's like you'll get to the end of an episode and it won't be fully explained like what really happened there.

409
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:25,065
Scott: We know most of it, but not all the details.

410
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:30,847
Scott: And, you know, you got sort of like that cyber eeriness going on, right, where not everything's explained in this.

411
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:36,830
Scott: Everything is literally and in plain text explained to you, except for the higher level meta.

412
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:37,453
Scott: Right.

413
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,540
Scott: Of course, they pretty much explain everything.

414
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,580
Scott: Someone just says right out everything that happened in a given episode at some point.

415
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,102
Scott: So nothing.

416
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:45,930
Scott: It's not like what really happened.

417
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,042
Scott: No, you just saw everything literally just happen, right?

418
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:53,395
Scott: There's no eerie ness of like, hmm, what's what's going on?

419
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:54,980
Scott: What's that guy up to?

420
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,505
Scott: You know, there's no mystery whatsoever.

421
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:57,028
Scott: Yep.

422
00:21:57,932 --> 00:22:03,113
Rym: And coupled with the fact that there's no mystery, it doesn't read like it does a terrible secret of space either.

423
00:22:03,274 --> 00:22:13,850
Rym: Well, other than the ones we already know about from other Ghost in the Shells or the sort of open questions of like what is going to happen in the future with this society?

424
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:21,513
Scott: There's also very little that like you can see foreshadowing of things in other Ghost in the Shells.

425
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:21,714
Scott: Right.

426
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:24,204
Scott: It's like, OK, so there's these logic commas.

427
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:26,933
Scott: Clearly they're touchy coma precursors.

428
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,422
Scott: But it's only really blatant stuff like that.

429
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:36,849
Scott: There's nothing else sort of like hinting at the laughing man or the puppeteer or any, you know, anything coming down the line.

430
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:40,884
Rym: There's a little bit of reference to the puppeteer with a certain spy.

431
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:44,071
Scott: I didn't notice any of the A.I.

432
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:46,236
Scott: Maybe a little bit.

433
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:47,178
Scott: Yeah.

434
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:47,759
Scott: Yeah.

435
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:48,301
Scott: I don't know that.

436
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:49,285
Rym: That was definitely.

437
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:52,818
Rym: But notice how that was inconceivable to them at that point.

438
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:53,180
Scott: Sure.

439
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:54,421
Scott: No.

440
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:55,064
Rym: Yeah.

441
00:22:55,886 --> 00:22:57,571
Rym: But it's interesting to watch the show.

442
00:22:57,592 --> 00:22:58,755
Rym: I like it a lot.

443
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:07,168
Rym: I don't like it as much as I liked actual standalone complex because it's missing a lot of the key elements that make standalone complex a standalone complex.

444
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:16,000
Rym: It's not directed by Kenji Kamiyama, the new one, and the music in the new one is not the same kind of music as every other Ghost in the Shell.

445
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:16,420
Scott: Yeah.

446
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,348
Scott: The music's not that exciting.

447
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:22,745
Scott: The music is very a lot like the Akira soundtrack where it's sort of like boom, boom, boom.

448
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:23,548
Scott: Right.

449
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,692
Rym: Which has its place.

450
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:25,936
Scott: Chanting and some noises.

451
00:23:26,117 --> 00:23:26,398
Scott: Right.

452
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,150
Rym: Mostly it's the opener is just really kind of milk toast.

453
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:34,887
Rym: The opener to both standalone complexes just drives you crazy.

454
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:37,660
Rym: Like you are pumped up and ready to jump off of buildings backwards.

455
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:38,581
Rym: Yeah.

456
00:23:38,722 --> 00:23:46,608
Rym: But then you watch this opener and you're like, can we just cyber butt past this opener and get back to the fighting in the show?

457
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:46,689
Rym: Yep.

458
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,816
Rym: Really like to get back to that.

459
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:52,628
Rym: So I don't know much about the guy who directs this new one.

460
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:59,992
Rym: I haven't really done much research on this yet because we're going to do a real review after we see the whole thing.

461
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:06,636
Rym: I mean, if we reviewed standalone complex after a couple episodes, it's just a completely standalone procedural police drama.

462
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,539
Rym: Yep.

463
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,342
Rym: Which is awesome.

464
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:09,969
Scott: You know, another seat, right?

465
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:11,093
Scott: Stuff happens.

466
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:11,696
Scott: So who knows?

467
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,691
Scott: Maybe like the next episode will say to be continued or something like that.

468
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:15,093
Scott: You don't know.

469
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:15,636
Scott: Yeah.

470
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:16,320
Rym: We don't know at all.

471
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:16,802
Rym: Right.

472
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:22,770
Scott: But yeah, I mean, if you like Ghost in the Shell, you'll still like this and want to watch it after you've watched all the other Ghost in the Shells.

473
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:23,192
Rym: Yep.

474
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:26,828
Rym: But now I really just want to go back and watch standalone complex.

475
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,217
Rym: I have this real urge to just watch.

476
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:30,482
Rym: In fact, I watched an episode.

477
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:32,974
Rym: Most of it's on YouTube for free legally, as far as I can tell.

478
00:24:32,994 --> 00:24:33,858
Scott: How about that?

479
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:34,240
Scott: Yeah.

480
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,341
Scott: Okay.

481
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,309
Scott: Maybe this will be one day.

482
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,360
Rym: If you're a fan of Ghost in the Shell, watch this however you can.

483
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:41,042
Rym: It's up.

484
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:42,007
Rym: It's in your wheelhouse.

485
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:43,695
Rym: There's no other anime for you to watch.

486
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:44,640
Rym: Kill La Kill is done.

487
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,047
Rym: Monica was done a long time ago.

488
00:24:47,067 --> 00:24:49,377
Rym: Attack on Titan has got a long time before.

489
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,623
Rym: anything new is coming out with that.

490
00:24:50,663 --> 00:24:52,612
Scott: Sailor Moon will be there for a long time.

491
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:53,496
Scott: It's not going anywhere.

492
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:54,038
Rym: Yep.

493
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:59,382
Rym: Of course, if you don't watch it as it's trickling out, it might be hard to bite down on that 200 episode monster.

494
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:01,552
Scott: I watched all of Fist of the North Star after it was all out.

495
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:02,035
Rym: True.

496
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:07,238
Rym: And then there's the new Sailor Moon, which that I'm going to watch as it comes out.

497
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:07,740
Scott: Yeah, probably.

498
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,791
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

499
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:20,993
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

500
00:25:21,214 --> 00:25:26,254
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

501
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:29,166
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

502
00:25:29,307 --> 00:25:33,927
Rym: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
