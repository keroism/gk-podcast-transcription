00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,684
Rym: It's Thursday December 11th 2014.

2
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:14,207
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:18,277
Rym: I'm Scott, and this is GeekNights tonight buses.

4
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,398
Rym: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,283
Rym: It was either that or torture, and you probably didn't want to hear us to talk about torture.

6
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:37,178
Rym: It would be torturous, so I Explained this to Scott a while ago, and and a thing happened.

7
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:52,255
Rym: this happened many times over the years where Scott asked a question and I Start answering, and I say a bunch of things and then later Scott acts like I never actually told him what the answer to that question was Definitely what I said.

8
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:54,164
Scott: you were definitely saying something you said.

9
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:55,490
Scott: I knew you were saying some words.

10
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:56,670
Scott: I just not listening to them.

11
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,009
Rym: You said what are you doing over there, and I explained in detail what I was doing over there.

12
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,789
Rym: So what do you think I was doing in the hallway?

13
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:05,737
Scott: peeing on the floor?

14
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:08,374
Rym: yeah, so Basically what happened?

15
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:14,440
Rym: we had some nice rugs that we used for the rabbits to run out in the hallway And there were nice rugs, and they worked fine.

16
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:16,390
Scott: all right the rugs you talked about yesterday.

17
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:22,150
Rym: I talked about them today because you asked me what I was doing and I assumed that you hadn't listened to me yesterday.

18
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:23,216
Scott: No, I didn't listen.

19
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:25,469
Scott: I didn't listen to you today is what I didn't listen.

20
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:32,269
Rym: So we got these rugs, and I went to pick one up because it was kind of dirty And I vacuumed in it didn't quite clean it enough.

21
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:36,290
Rym: So I just thought I'm just gonna pick it up and take it out and shake it on the balcony.

22
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,509
Rym: I go to pick it up, and it's stuck to the floor.

23
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,655
Rym: so I Investigate a little bit.

24
00:01:42,695 --> 00:01:52,770
Rym: It looks like the latex and other things backing on the rug Has just fucking rotted away and kind of fused to the hardwood, and it was a giant mess.

25
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,273
Scott: Well didn't you know?

26
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:54,981
Scott: that's one of those auto-adhesive rugs.

27
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:56,670
Scott: it turns into a carpet for free now.

28
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:03,314
Rym: so I Put it back.

29
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:11,387
Rym: so I threw it away, and then I proceeded to try to figure out how to remove this Residue from my floor without paying anyone a lot of money.

30
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:14,459
Rym: alcohol Yeah, no alcohol has no effect.

31
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:33,507
Rym: I tried a number of different solvents and There here's what works best number one water Okay, number two which is actually a much better solvent and works super well Benzene which I'm not going to use because we know better now as humans not to fuck around with benzene.

32
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:34,229
Scott: a dish soap.

33
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:35,408
Rym: Nope, no effect.

34
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,850
Rym: Ammonia of any none of those things any effect, but apparently turpentine is also super effective.

35
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:45,950
Scott: How about your face just like get down really near and lick it and bite it and?

36
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:52,186
Scott: It's not the worst solution, so it'll work slowly, but get the job toothbrush.

37
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:56,929
Rym: so basically There's two rugs the other larger rug.

38
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:04,172
Rym: I Have chosen not to deal with that for the time being and was leaving that rug where it is and the rug that already pulled Up.

39
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:13,230
Rym: I've spent the last few days with up with water and A putty knife and a whole bunch of elbow grease.

40
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:14,587
Rym: fucking sucks.

41
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:20,125
Rym: However the good news is there's a chance that actually our renters insurance covers it.

42
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:30,729
Rym: so if they do I'm Probably just still gonna deal with it myself And then we'll just make a claim based on the cost of the remediation and see if we can just get a bunch of money

43
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:31,552
Scott: Mmm,

44
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:34,108
Rym: or maybe I'll hire someone to do the second half of it.

45
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:38,829
Scott: I just didn't get rugs and scratched up my floor instead.

46
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,483
Scott: that won't matter until I move out in which case they'll probably just be Like we're keeping your security deposit like fine I don't give a fuck.

47
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:48,120
Rym: you have the New York City our rug claws in your lease, or is it just our lease?

48
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,883
Scott: I think I do.

49
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:52,380
Rym: yeah a lot of New York leases a little insight into what it's like to live in, New York.

50
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:55,529
Rym: They basically have this clause in most New York leases.

51
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:05,418
Rym: that says something like 80% of the non bathroom Floorage in your apartment must be covered by carpets that are at least like 0.5 centimeters thick mm-hmm.

52
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:09,019
Rym: The actual reason that's there so that they want to kick you out.

53
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:17,240
Rym: They can go up and be like look They didn't cover their floor, and we warn them and they still haven't bought enough rugs to cover their floor.

54
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,726
Scott: Why did I?

55
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:18,738
Scott: why did I buy this?

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,252
Scott: Apartment with such a nice floor?

57
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:23,110
Scott: if I'm gonna cover it up Why did I buy this table?

58
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,920
Scott: if I'm gonna cover it up with a tablecloth?

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,800
Rym: It's kind of well.

60
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:29,880
Rym: I only cover things with the tablecloth because the tablecloth is really nice to use when you're playing a board game.

61
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:33,574
Scott: I cover things in the tablecloth because if there's gonna be like a huge mess.

62
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:39,218
Scott: I'm not about protecting the table I'm about cleaning it up in two seconds by just throwing away the tablecloth away.

63
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,412
Rym: Paper tablecloth you just take a fabric one just throw it in the washing machine.

64
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:45,355
Scott: same deal all good.

65
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:51,787
Rym: Yeah, that's fine same deal Yeah, so uh got any news Cap'n I do have a news.

66
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:58,611
Scott: so yet again for like the fifth time in our lives Ye Pirate Bay is let down.

67
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,399
Rym: however this time it might be the end.

68
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:02,539
Scott: I mean it could always be the end.

69
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,635
Rym: well No like one of the founders something else will come out.

70
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:10,220
Rym: one of the founders I just got out of jail the one he basically said yeah, it was only intended to last ten years.

71
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:18,971
Rym: The Pirate Bay has increasingly been funded by increasingly abhorrent ads So much more important than I could have ever imagined they would be.

72
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:21,640
Rym: yeah that we need a new paradigm.

73
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:27,160
Rym: So fuck it next generation pirate away in a new fashion, and we'll pirate away in a new fashion.

74
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,005
Scott: No problem however.

75
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:33,412
Rym: This is this inconvenience me in the short term because Most of the shows I'm watching ain't that?

76
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:33,633
Rym: the?

77
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,180
Rym: the pay for HBO thing?

78
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,060
Rym: Still isn't actually available yet, so I really can't watch a lot of the things I watch except on the Pirate Bay.

79
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,391
Scott: I mean I just need a new place to get torrents from.

80
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,020
Scott: I'm sure there's plenty of them.

81
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,783
Rym: Torrance of what.

82
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,509
Rym: what are you even watching a bit time?

83
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,119
Rym: Yeah adventure time South Park South Park?

84
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,302
Scott: That's the only things.

85
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:54,072
Rym: really is Pirate Bay for the amazing world of gumball?

86
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:55,638
Scott: don't watch that you really should.

87
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:55,999
Rym: that's it.

88
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,629
Rym: I love that show is actually one of my favorite cartoons now.

89
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,704
Rym: Yeah, though Rick and Morty you can actually watch for free at least Whatever.

90
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,274
Rym: I can't believe you haven't watched Rick and Morty either.

91
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:06,500
Scott: How much y'all pedal have you watch?

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,487
Scott: 12 episodes shut up.

93
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,415
Rym: how much Sailor Moon Crystal have you watched?

94
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:12,460
Scott: one episode?

95
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:16,308
Rym: Ah How much Breaking Bad did you watch.

96
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:19,959
Rym: zero Game of Thrones zero all right all right?

97
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,695
Scott: Daily show I watched like the clips when someone links to it John Oliver.

98
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:25,899
Scott: They're all same.

99
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,535
Rym: oh Crash Course none really really.

100
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:35,067
Rym: you haven't watched Crash Course It's you know that chemistry show you like.

101
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:36,473
Rym: take that make it a hundred times better.

102
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,738
Rym: and about things you actually care about.

103
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:42,970
Rym: I care about chemistry a lot, I think you'll care about the Mongols and Such much more.

104
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,159
Scott: are they breaking down my shitty wall?

105
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,902
Rym: But yeah the Italy.

106
00:06:48,922 --> 00:07:02,006
Rym: interesting to see what comes out of this because the one thing that the Pirate Bay did not do you know every iteration of Getting information to places for free in a way that doesn't require trust and direct knowledge.

107
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:02,408
Rym: like you know.

108
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:20,700
Rym: you can trust and direct knowledge with IRC if you want, but Basically every way has been has had like one Fatal flaw and we fixed fatal flaws along the way, but right now the fatal flaw of current torrents Is that there has to be a place where you find the tracker?

109
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:26,355
Rym: So what we really need is the distributed tracker system.

110
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:31,472
Rym: We do sort of have that that exists Yeah, but how do you get to the the entry point to a tracker?

111
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:33,980
Scott: you have to you know figure it out?

112
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,503
Rym: So there's a lot of people talking about making a tour basically a torrent web browser Which is the future.

113
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:45,398
Rym: some smart person will make that unless the drink-or-die spirit is good and truly dead.

114
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:49,658
Rym: hmm Yeah, so I don't think the Pirate Bay is going to bet on it.

115
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:51,857
Rym: You want to bet if it's gonna come back?

116
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:55,630
Scott: So here's the thing that's really interesting about how it went down.

117
00:07:56,112 --> 00:08:01,413
Scott: so the Pirate Bay claimed That it was up in so many places that were all secret.

118
00:08:01,453 --> 00:08:01,835
Scott: that you did.

119
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:05,535
Rym: it would never be able to be taken But as far as I can gather is pretty much just up in Sweden.

120
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:15,080
Scott: Yeah Secondly I Remember a rumor happening a long time ago that sounded pretty plausible right in that in Sweden similarly to the u.s.

121
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,994
Scott: The people in the legislative branch like can't be like.

122
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,520
Scott: if you're a congressperson in the u.s.

123
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,531
Scott: You can't really be charged with crimes you commit in the Congress right.

124
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:28,022
Scott: so it's like if you're just lighting up some meth in The Capitol.

125
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:30,931
Scott: they can't do anything about it.

126
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,455
Scott: so similar thing in Sweden.

127
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:41,020
Scott: There was a rumor that hey They'll just set up the Pirate Bay like in Swedish government building which would have been brilliant, and they wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

128
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,332
Rym: but no apparently it was in a data center in NACA.

129
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,740
Scott: yeah that the the.

130
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:51,660
Scott: When the news first came out they were like they they won't say where they went to go and take down the server.

131
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,531
Scott: So I was like oh, maybe it was the Swedish government thing.

132
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:55,020
Scott: yeah, but it wasn't.

133
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,733
Rym: Apparently a Super Bay is down as well as is BAM.

134
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,760
Scott: Yeah, well they were all running your lead.

135
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,280
Rym: Yeah, so BAM your leading site for digimon porn is finally gone.

136
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,170
Scott: I mean imger really don't means you don't need BAM.

137
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,320
Rym: Yeah, BAM was never actually useful from day one.

138
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,040
Rym: It was just digimon.

139
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,389
Scott: It would have been useful if imger did not exist.

140
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,273
Scott: it would have taken would have been.

141
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:18,060
Rym: no because even then it was nothing.

142
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,009
Rym: But digimon porn it was hard to use doesn't matter.

143
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:21,230
Scott: well.

144
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,168
Scott: It doesn't matter if what imger isn't about what's on there It's about you.

145
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,080
Scott: use it for yourself.

146
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,015
Rym: Yes, but imger was easy to use and it wasn't just a haven of digimon.

147
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,219
Scott: maybe if more people use BAM.

148
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:37,518
Scott: And because imger didn't exist a non-digimon porn fashion You're just obsessed with digimon porn.

149
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,520
Rym: Go find the episode of GeekNights where we talked about BAM when it first came into existence because we're I sort of forgot it existed.

150
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:44,324
Scott: So they mentioned that.

151
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:50,659
Rym: yeah, so did I because in that episode live I was like ooh This will be a way to destroy and I clicked on it live in the show.

152
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:58,734
Rym: And if you and I'm pretty sure it was nothing, but digimon porn and I was like I gassed at this Yeah, and then we just talked about that for a while.

153
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,080
Rym: Oh Pirate Bay you will either be back or Pirate Bay had the longest run of any of these things ever.

154
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:13,820
Scott: the one thing about Pirate Bay That I will miss if it doesn't come back is that they would promote good things on the home page.

155
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:17,960
Rym: Well, I mean, that's how I found that this is what happens when you call the police music video.

156
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,622
Rym: That's right.

157
00:10:18,642 --> 00:10:25,008
Scott: They live in lately like the front page of the Pirate Bay like promoted things that you know, we're good and then you know, we're.

158
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,084
Scott: it was like basically the thing of the day of Awesomeness, yeah, here we go.

159
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:30,789
Rym: Peter Peter Sunday the pirate.

160
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,762
Scott: He's the guy who just got out of jail should stay down Yep.

161
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:37,913
Scott: Well, I mean he's basically like he's definitely quote.

162
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,842
Rym: the Pirate Bay has been raided again Again.

163
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,447
Rym: that happened over eight years ago.

164
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,029
Rym: last time.

165
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,098
Rym: that time a lot of people went out to protests and rally in the streets.

166
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:49,419
Rym: today Few seem to care and I'm one of them.

167
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:53,591
Rym: The site was ugly full of bugs old code and old designs.

168
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:56,159
Rym: it never changed except for one thing the ads.

169
00:10:57,101 --> 00:11:06,140
Rym: More and more ads were filling the site and somehow when it felt unimaginable to make those ads more distasteful They somehow ended up even worse.

170
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:12,288
Scott: Yeah, I don't know who was running the Pirate Bay or how they got a hold of it But the people originally made it like Peter here.

171
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:13,814
Scott: They didn't cover it in ads.

172
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,520
Scott: They were doing it for the sake of pirating.

173
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:22,220
Scott: So, I don't know how these other people came to possess it, but they definitely were in it for the money.

174
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:25,640
Rym: Maybe therefore maybe the reason it was so resilient.

175
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,880
Rym: You could use that money to fund a lot of different data centers and servers and shit.

176
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:32,175
Scott: Maybe hard to say I don't know.

177
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,220
Scott: Maybe yeah, maybe they just needed the money and they were to fund to keep it up and they were desperate.

178
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:44,611
Rym: So we either need distributed torrents or any data centers on Satellites and on barges in international waters.

179
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:48,479
Scott: Let's just code it ourselves or let's set up waste rewrite waste.

180
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,429
Rym: Someone's gonna have to rewrite waste.

181
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,020
Scott: if we why don't we get the guy who wrote waste the win amp guy?

182
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,824
Scott: What's his name?

183
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,080
Rym: Why don't we actually I actually forgot his name?

184
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,200
Rym: So I feel really bad and dumb about that because he's one of the more important people in the history of the modern internet.

185
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:04,522
Scott: Yeah Call him up.

186
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:06,769
Rym: No soft guy.

187
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:09,296
Rym: I'm just searching for null soft guy Justin Frankel.

188
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:09,898
Scott: That's the guy.

189
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:10,540
Rym: that is the guy.

190
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,384
Scott: How do we call him up?

191
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:14,035
Rym: I'm glad that null soft guy as a search actually turns it up.

192
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:14,437
Rym: Yes.

193
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:14,859
Rym: Yes.

194
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:25,554
Rym: So in other news There's a bunch of news around the same topic and I don't want to cover all the ground We've covered on this before so I'm gonna skip a lot of things.

195
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:29,255
Rym: I would normally say here So Scott, you don't need to be like ah this again.

196
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:42,519
Rym: So one there's a new extension a Modern one for browsers that doesn't just block ads it clicks on them a random Percentage of the time and also acts like it downloaded all of them.

197
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:48,980
Scott: So to cost the people buying the ads money up and to make money for the people who are hosting the ads.

198
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,786
Scott: So you visit a website they get money.

199
00:12:50,806 --> 00:13:08,932
Rym: It also hides the fact that you're running ad blocking software because some sites now like disable functionality if you're blocking ads and Because it clicks randomly it removes or reduces the value of the data Generated from the ad clicks because it fills them with random shit.

200
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:11,460
Rym: It looks like it'll even like fill out forms with random garbage.

201
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,990
Rym: Okay, so that's interesting and a lot of people are mad about it.

202
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:22,239
Rym: independently a bunch of French publishers are filing lawsuits against adblock plus.

203
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:28,160
Rym: Um, you know the grounds the fraud and all the kinds of stupid fraud.

204
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,700
Rym: Yeah, what are they committing?

205
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,456
Scott: The growing rejection promise to block ads and we block them.

206
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:36,280
Scott: fraud.

207
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:41,393
Rym: Yeah, well that blocking ads while looking at websites is itself fraud.

208
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:44,100
Rym: your steal, you know the same bullshit argument that just failed.

209
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,820
Scott: I mean that could be described as many things but fraud is not one of those things.

210
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,429
Scott: It could be described as accurately.

211
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,239
Rym: so neither of these things is new.

212
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:55,080
Rym: You guys may not pay attention because you just run adblock and don't think about it.

213
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:58,374
Rym: Or I know people who are young who don't run adblock.

214
00:13:58,394 --> 00:13:59,660
Rym: I don't know how you fucking use the internet.

215
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:00,986
Scott: I definitely don't know how to use it.

216
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:03,858
Rym: Like I've seen what the internet looks like without an adblock.

217
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:04,782
Scott: It's bad It's.

218
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:06,791
Rym: I would not use it if it looked like.

219
00:14:06,852 --> 00:14:14,360
Rym: well not not the internet the World Wide Web Yes to be fair to be do you talk about this stuff correctly, but none of this is new.

220
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,470
Rym: I mean I was running ad blocking software when I had a modem.

221
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:20,656
Rym: Mm-hmm, and I was also you.

222
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:30,820
Rym: well anyway, so Coupled with all this somehow the advertising industries still make a shit ton of money with online ads, of course.

223
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:37,562
Scott: So same way that spammers made a shit ton of money even though they were sending like Viagra Viagra Viagra Somehow.

224
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:38,184
Scott: that makes money.

225
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:55,731
Rym: So there are stupid people who click on ads and buy things from ads and There are also people who aren't stupid But they click on ads to give money to the person probably who runs the website they like and they're just stealing money effectively From the person who's you know, actually bought the ad.

226
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:56,113
Rym: Mm-hmm.

227
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,160
Rym: That whole ecosystem is not changed in forever.

228
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:06,140
Rym: But There's an article a couple articles that have come out recently that have done some investigative journalism and kind of pointed the same thing.

229
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:22,520
Rym: It is likely that the majority of ad clicks at least in the modern internet are pretty much entirely from Organized crime run ad clicking networks that are part of giant global money laundering schemes.

230
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,655
Rym: Because ad clicks, you know what this is like in the old days.

231
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:29,665
Rym: if you wanted to launder money What's the most effective way to do it?

232
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:37,469
Scott: Unless you're already rich and in the government open a business and then have legitimate Purchases on record for that business.

233
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,600
Scott: Okay, like I need to launder a thousand dollars.

234
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:49,534
Scott: Well this barber shop I set up that no one ever seems to come in Had like a hundred haircuts for ten bucks each thousand dollars laundered.

235
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:51,420
Scott: all good the barber shop.

236
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:55,373
Rym: That's the reason why especially in the 60s 70s and 80s.

237
00:15:55,634 --> 00:16:01,319
Rym: There were so many barber shops That somehow managed to stay open in the shittiest parts of town.

238
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,980
Scott: But this liquor store just managed to sell so much goddamn liquor.

239
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,428
Rym: Well liquor is hard because it's a physical commodity you're selling.

240
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:16,615
Rym: the point is it's a business where there is no real way to Prove whether or not you're doing business other than a stakeout.

241
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:17,098
Rym: Mm-hmm.

242
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:27,382
Rym: So in the modern world You don't need a barbershop because there are two things that are ready-made to launder money and there's basically no way to ever get Caught.

243
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:29,873
Rym: number one ads online.

244
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:30,295
Scott: Yep.

245
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:35,807
Rym: Number two DLC in Shitty video games.

246
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:37,092
Scott: Ah, that's a good one.

247
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:44,100
Rym: If I was going to launder money today I would make a free-to-play game that was garbage but had people playing don't care if it makes money or not.

248
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:52,208
Rym: People who needed to launder money would basically buy cards with cash or whatever They would do to buy items in the game.

249
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:57,545
Rym: My game company has nothing but clean money Except apples taking a cut.

250
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:05,665
Rym: Oh, no apples taking a small percentage of my illegal free money To turn it legal.

251
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:07,935
Scott: Yeah, I mean that that is a good plan.

252
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:10,806
Scott: That would probably work for I think it's happening.

253
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,659
Rym: I think it is a huge part of the freemium gaming industry.

254
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,059
Scott: Sure I'm dead serious, but at the same time If you did that it, you know.

255
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,520
Scott: The one thing that our justice system is actually very good at is going after mafias.

256
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,866
Scott: That's like their special move.

257
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,960
Rym: They just arrested another Gambino in New York like today.

258
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,277
Scott: Yeah, all of the laws that we have like RICO Act, etc, etc.

259
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:36,900
Scott: We're all originally designed to go after organized crimes, right?

260
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:44,346
Scott: Which is why they're also good at going against gang because those are organized crimes and they're really bad at going against Unorganized things like anonymous.

261
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:53,732
Rym: Well, yeah today looks like today 30 FBI agents and Italian authorities and Interpol Rated a New York apartment and caught one of the last free Gambino under bosses.

262
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,033
Rym: Sure.

263
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,457
Rym: That's how these look.

264
00:17:55,497 --> 00:17:56,099
Rym: It's counter-strike.

265
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,580
Scott: Anyway, right, but that's like the thing that they are ridiculously good at because they were designed to do that.

266
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,356
Scott: However, so that's why anything that they do that doesn't fit that they usually try to be like.

267
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:18,560
Scott: there's a leader here Who's you know, they try to you know, make it so that there is some sort of organization or conspiracy or something.

268
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:27,535
Rym: However, they can use their anti-mafia technology by doing this with gaming technology like DLC and in-app purchases and things like that.

269
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:37,404
Rym: Technology makes it almost impossible to prove malfeasance because you are actually literally selling real things that are a legitimate Economy on their own.

270
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:46,740
Rym: So it's almost as like you have a store or a factory that for free is Making things that you're actually selling for real money except that factory doesn't cost you anything to run.

271
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:55,320
Rym: So it's free money laundering The tech and with encryption and deniability this makes it an order of magnitude easier to launder.

272
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,168
Scott: Listen laundering money was never the problem.

273
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:59,116
Scott: getting the money to launder is always the problem.

274
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,431
Rym: Yeah However, they do that.

275
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:05,937
Rym: I'm Convinced selling drugs perhaps selling community.

276
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:06,379
Rym: Yep.

277
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:18,907
Rym: So I really really really think that online advertising is hugely bolstered as an industry by organized crime.

278
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:35,760
Rym: and I suspect if you are able to crack down on the organized crime that is likely Blondering money and or using this network for other purposes and get remove it from advertising That online advertising as an industry would fall fucking apart and there would be a big disaster.

279
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,997
Scott: Well, they would still exist in you know cases where it's like the big companies buying ads.

280
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:41,900
Scott: Yeah, that's about it.

281
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:47,582
Rym: But I think like a big chunk of advertising would disappear and the internet would just radically be Stabilized.

282
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:52,801
Scott: for example things like the Pirate Bay that have a million shitty ads all over them that no one ever clicks on and everyone Hates.

283
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:54,727
Scott: no one's buying those ads.

284
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:57,515
Scott: You ever wonder why those ads are mostly for porn and casinos.

285
00:19:57,616 --> 00:20:01,042
Rym: Yeah, it's like That.

286
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:03,733
Rym: Facebook ads 80% of the clicks are bots.

287
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:04,958
Scott: Yeah, that's about right.

288
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:05,279
Rym: Yeah.

289
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:12,640
Rym: So all these things together are really interesting and this is a world that More investigative journalism needs to be done.

290
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:16,260
Rym: I don't want to name names and I don't want to be guilty of libel or slander or anything.

291
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,926
Rym: But there's some specific game companies.

292
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:20,474
Rym: I actually suspect of doing this like for real.

293
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:20,896
Rym: Mm-hmm.

294
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:31,164
Rym: But anyway things of the day Scott's is super serious.

295
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:33,170
Rym: So I'm gonna give you the non serious one first.

296
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,256
Scott: How could non serious could it be?

297
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:39,291
Rym: So Jackie Chan Super funny dude super funny movies.

298
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,420
Rym: I'm a big fan of Jackie Chan movies in general.

299
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:43,639
Rym: I'm also a big fan of kung-fu movies in general.

300
00:20:44,382 --> 00:21:04,483
Rym: but this is a video where someone analyzes Jackie Chan films and Explains basically how to do action comedy why Jackie Chan did it very well why modern movies are awful at it and It's just a really good 10-minute video that goes into a lot of depth and was made by someone who's very observant very intelligent Knowledgeable, I

301
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:10,928
Scott: mean really what it comes down to is that modern movies have an action scene and a comedy scene and they don't do Them in the same scene.

302
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:16,673
Scott: Yeah, or even if they do do them in the same scene The comedy and the action will be not the same thing.

303
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:17,536
Rym: They're not integrated.

304
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:18,640
Rym: Yeah, it's like separate.

305
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,041
Rym: There'll be.

306
00:21:19,122 --> 00:21:26,780
Scott: someone will like do some punching and kicking and then stop it like spider-man, you know Well, even the comic spider-man doesn't really merge his stuff

307
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,010
Rym: But up there hanging then he says his witty one says

308
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,748
Scott: his witty one-liner and then he fights and then he stops and then But his fighting itself is not funny Jackie Chan.

309
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:40,881
Scott: His thing was his actual action of fighting was in itself Comedic.

310
00:21:41,122 --> 00:21:41,966
Rym: Yeah, but you know what actually.

311
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:45,320
Rym: our friend the juggler Luke Burrage explained this with a nice analogies.

312
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,571
Rym: We were he was talking about doing a new bit and juggling and a bunch of us were like Ah, you should do the bit like this.

313
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:59,180
Rym: and he was like you Americans You always have if you want to do a juggling routine You always think of it as you're gonna do some juggling and you're also telling jokes and things and they're separate.

314
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:04,636
Rym: The whole point is that the juggling itself is the joke and you're augmenting it exactly.

315
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:19,064
Rym: so this video is great and If you watch this This is why I don't find a lot of the action movies that you guys like to be particularly entertaining or funny Even when they're intending to be funny, I mean It's not like action.

316
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:27,436
Scott: comedy is like a particular thing that I'm like mega into but it's just one more example of reasons I hardly ever watch any new movie ever.

317
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:29,064
Rym: Yep I mean one of the like.

318
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:34,920
Rym: it talks about how a genre of any kind even good like modern action movies in the u.s.

319
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:40,522
Rym: At least usually have a ton of jump cuts and they do all these things to obfuscate the actual like Transformers.

320
00:22:41,004 --> 00:22:48,528
Rym: those see those action scenes in the Transformers movies are just a bunch of Nonsensical garbage flying around the screen.

321
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,039
Rym: Jackie Chan is a long cut of him hurting himself physically.

322
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,110
Scott: All right, so serious thing of the day.

323
00:22:55,431 --> 00:22:58,100
Scott: so I know a lot of people out there.

324
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:03,240
Scott: They just so mad about politics and shit all the time and I'm just like shut up everybody.

325
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:07,720
Scott: All you guys keep doing the same the same thing over and over again for no reason with no effect whatsoever.

326
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:12,537
Scott: So I have found a key piece of evidence to support my position.

327
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:25,818
Rym: Yep This video other than the fact that the word Negro comes out in the first 30 seconds Yeah, as does the words the word Arabia yep, but otherwise this video might as well.

328
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,002
Scott: it is 1965.

329
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:29,711
Rym: that wasn't that long ago as long ago.

330
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:30,393
Scott: So in 1965, mr.

331
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:42,980
Scott: X. Mr Malcolm X appeared on the CBC the Canadian Broadcasting Company and A bunch of white dudes asked him a bunch of questions a lot of back-handedly insulting questions.

332
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:52,420
Scott: Pretty much the same kind of questions you'd get from a white right-wing dude on Fox News today But coached with a nice sort of Canadian sensibility very very masking.

333
00:23:52,460 --> 00:24:01,490
Scott: The one major difference is that unlike say a Fox News of today these white dudes Actually shut up and didn't say anything or interrupt.

334
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:01,751
Scott: Mr.

335
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:03,718
Scott: X while he was talking and mr.

336
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:03,758
Scott: X?

337
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:06,246
Scott: Well, I don't agree with everything.

338
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:06,507
Scott: Mr.

339
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:12,979
Scott: X stood for in his day, you know, I'm not exactly a Muslim You know quite the opposite in fact.

340
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:23,379
Rym: So Pretty much is Judaism or that Judaism is the opposite of Islam the combination of the two.

341
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:41,160
Scott: He pretty much argues his point in an intelligent rational Educated fashion the same way that we would argue our points in an intelligent rational educated fashion Even though lately I've been giving up and just calling people ignorant bad, right?

342
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,365
Scott: Because it's pretty much no point.

343
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:47,980
Scott: even though he did this back in the day on TV It didn't matter.

344
00:24:49,182 --> 00:24:52,052
Scott: All you're yelling and whining doesn't actually change anything.

345
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:53,257
Scott: and that's part of what mr.

346
00:24:53,377 --> 00:24:54,060
Scott: X has to say.

347
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,460
Scott: He says look, you know, I love Martin Luther King sand, but it's not getting anything done and all you guys blocking traffic.

348
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,003
Scott: It's like look.

349
00:25:01,345 --> 00:25:02,813
Scott: I love you blocking traffic out there.

350
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:03,939
Scott: I totally agree with you.

351
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:12,814
Scott: I hate cars too, so I'm actually happy that you're fucking up the traffic But notice not a goddamn thing has happened or changed as a result of it.

352
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,463
Scott: that is a tactic that is not Effective.

353
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:20,908
Rym: thus the ever-present question whenever you bring up one of these things What is to be done?

354
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,939
Scott: murder all the rich people?

355
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,469
Rym: Pretty much out.

356
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:28,710
Rym: Well, no There was a time in your life Scott.

357
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:34,500
Rym: Yeah when you had a different answer to that question I remember what your answer used to be wait for the rich people and all people to die.

358
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:37,876
Scott: Even earlier than that don't give a shit just live your life.

359
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:38,760
Rym: destroy television.

360
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:40,059
Scott: That's also a good move.

361
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:42,248
Rym: That was we were pretty serious about.

362
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:50,579
Rym: maybe a bunch of nerd terrorists should get together and just one day Literally destroy the entire global television infrastructure at once.

363
00:25:51,442 --> 00:25:54,691
Scott: The only reason that I don't think that's a good idea anymore.

364
00:25:55,092 --> 00:26:00,147
Scott: Is that if we used a method of blowing up satellites We really it was.

365
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:02,380
Scott: it was hard for the space people to get the satellites up there.

366
00:26:02,742 --> 00:26:04,531
Scott: It would sort of not be cool to blow them up.

367
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:06,120
Rym: think of the space people we need.

368
00:26:06,682 --> 00:26:09,935
Scott: We need some way to disable television besides blowing up all the satellites.

369
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:13,658
Rym: I still think the best shot We've got is Lawrence Lessig's thing because as you can see.

370
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,904
Scott: well I mean he is.

371
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:24,385
Scott: he is correctly identified the ultimate root of the entire problem And but he has not found an effective solution because I don't know What did he say.

372
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:27,860
Rym: the whole point of this first initiative is to try to find what yeah?

373
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:35,644
Rym: Data and he just published all the data they gathered on to and how to mess with the light and it is now appears to be even more hopeless.

374
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:44,500
Rym: yeah, because seriously the the gist of the statistics and the research was number of dollars equals winning election.

375
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,664
Rym: Literally nothing else mattered.

376
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:55,354
Rym: yes, so we need to gather dollars to fight against the people who have all the we only gathered like 12 million million.

377
00:26:57,165 --> 00:26:58,719
Scott: We're up against hundreds of millions.

378
00:26:58,822 --> 00:27:06,980
Scott: Yeah Only way that this can possibly be fixed is if one of the ridiculously rich people Turns coat against the other ridiculous church code.

379
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:13,220
Rym: But does your classic cling to the other people and set themselves on fire burn their fortune?

380
00:27:13,502 --> 00:27:15,030
Scott: Yes, as well as their own.

381
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:18,332
Rym: Yeah, so That was depressing.

382
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:25,692
Rym: but also If you don't know a lot about Malcolm X which I suspect a lot of you young kids Probably they might not even know who it is.

383
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:26,377
Scott: There is a movie.

384
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:30,835
Scott: It's not bad It's pretty good, but it's not a hundred and historically accurate as any movie would be.

385
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:35,360
Scott: but I figure you punk kids Who know nothing you know I'm lucky if I can get you to watch the movie.

386
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,846
Rym: It is accurate in one sense.

387
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:45,994
Rym: Malcolm X has one of the most intense facial expressions Generally that a human being is ever held as a resting face.

388
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:50,180
Rym: Yeah pretty much In the meta moment the booklet book is water ship down.

389
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,936
Rym: it's about a bunch of rabbits, and it's really good, and I've moved on.

390
00:27:53,996 --> 00:27:58,614
Rym: I'm reading the Yiddish policeman's Union, and I'll see if I finish that before Scott starts.

391
00:27:58,675 --> 00:27:59,900
Rym: water ship down, okay?

392
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:08,242
Rym: Yeah We're gonna be a PAX South presenting on Sunday in the armadillo theater bad games an updated version of our old panel also called bad Games.

393
00:28:08,283 --> 00:28:10,640
Scott: you can't make it to PAX South magfest same weekend.

394
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:19,440
Rym: Yeah, same weekend, and then not too long after that we're gonna be at PAX East and then the first weekend of March yep And tiny chance we're gonna go to generic on after it.

395
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,160
Scott: I say that because we've not invited generic on every year of like a zillion years.

396
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:24,487
Scott: I've never gone to it ever.

397
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:24,709
Rym: well.

398
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:25,734
Rym: I feel bad isn't it?

399
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:26,780
Scott: a tiny college con?

400
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:27,689
Rym: We actually don't.

401
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:35,920
Scott: in the cold upstate I often don't even respond to emails from conventions that ask us to attend But they've kept us on their mailing list all these years even though we've never once responded to them.

402
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,806
Rym: So I'm asking you the least.

403
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:40,976
Scott: some listener went there once and that's why you the listener.

404
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:45,268
Rym: I ask you Will you be a generic on and all being?

405
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:48,858
Rym: Oh Rensselaer, New York should we go to generic on?

406
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:49,620
Rym: it's up to you.

407
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:51,339
Rym: Do you think we should be there?

408
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,155
Scott: Because kind of thinking about doing it does anyone who plays netrunner going to be there cuz?

409
00:28:56,175 --> 00:29:02,407
Scott: then even if it's garbage You can save my weekend, and we can make it netrunner weekend Or we'll just play wizard over and over and over again.

410
00:29:02,488 --> 00:29:08,588
Scott: anyone who wants to play wizard will you go yeah and play wizard all Weekend if it sucks Otherwise?

411
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:09,660
Rym: watch all their stuff on YouTube.

412
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:12,386
Scott: Yeah, utenna, it's happy.

413
00:29:12,406 --> 00:29:15,576
Rym: yes, we recorded another episode of GeekNights presents utenna.

414
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:16,820
Rym: I'm editing it currently.

415
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,360
Rym: I'll put it up as soon as I can, but I'm skiing Saturday and go to a party on Sunday.

416
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:23,731
Rym: So we'll see when I actually get it done.

417
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:24,658
Scott: break the world shell.

418
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:32,580
Rym: Except the world shells cracking apparently according to episode 13 all the easier for you to break it actually.

419
00:29:34,844 --> 00:29:35,571
Scott: So get cracking.

420
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:40,823
Rym: so Real talk guys buses Fucking awful.

421
00:29:41,265 --> 00:29:49,953
Rym: well mostly I mean there are occasionally good buses very rare and even then The best buses are at best tolerable.

422
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:51,799
Scott: Yes the most.

423
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:55,740
Scott: Basically the history of buses is a history of being bad on purpose.

424
00:29:56,001 --> 00:30:00,640
Scott: So I don't know if anyone here has watched Roger Rabbit the movie who framed Roger Rabbit.

425
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,925
Rym: We did an episode about it.

426
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:03,090
Scott: You should have seen it by now.

427
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:10,774
Scott: Roger rabbit is actually a true story Not the anime cartoon part the the replace the streetcar with the bus part.

428
00:30:10,814 --> 00:30:13,020
Scott: basically what happened was way back in the day.

429
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,356
Scott: There were streetcars everywhere, and they were fucking awesome and people use them all the goddamn time.

430
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:22,279
Scott: so people who lived in cities Didn't own any fucking cars because they didn't need that shit.

431
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,772
Scott: Yeah, just like me today right only a lot more people didn't.

432
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:27,839
Scott: now in the city even on my street.

433
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:32,377
Scott: sure I don't have a car But this car is parked all the way up and down the street and auto shops all near my right.

434
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:35,146
Scott: so How did that come to be?

435
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:38,780
Scott: why was the streetcar which is here just decades ago now gone?

436
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,128
Scott: It was like every city.

437
00:30:40,249 --> 00:30:44,467
Scott: even medium and small cities like Rochester New York had streetcars, and they don't have them anymore.

438
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:55,898
Scott: well what happened was is GM and other car companies in the US Realized huh we could sell a lot more cars if people actually needed them to get around and couldn't just use a streetcar.

439
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:56,400
Scott: some shit.

440
00:30:57,163 --> 00:31:01,160
Scott: So they bought the streetcar owning companies which were private companies.

441
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,819
Scott: They weren't like the MTA some public thing you couldn't buy and they just shut them down.

442
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,597
Scott: and Then they said oh, I guess they had to replace these with something.

443
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:11,364
Scott: They replaced him with buses.

444
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:14,836
Scott: so okay people just use the bus instead of buying cars.

445
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:15,860
Scott: What did they accomplish?

446
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,095
Scott: Well number one since their car companies and not train companies.

447
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:20,140
Scott: They made buses.

448
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:22,190
Scott: They didn't make train cars.

449
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:33,074
Scott: and number two it also You know buses use roads, and if they made roads for buses while you're making roads for cars Which is good for them yep making things like superhighways for their cars.

450
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:40,588
Scott: and three They made the bus schedule since they own the bus companies Really shitty on purpose.

451
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:42,439
Scott: and they made the way buses work.

452
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:48,481
Scott: Just shitty on purpose so that you would ride the bus and hate it and then get a car to save you from the horrible Bus.

453
00:31:48,662 --> 00:31:55,985
Rym: and meanwhile even if they hadn't done that because of the rising cars the buses got stuck in traffic Thus defeating the purpose.

454
00:31:56,366 --> 00:32:00,760
Rym: buses are way less comfortable than streetcars because of bus suspensions.

455
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,774
Rym: Yep, the everything is wrong with them.

456
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:16,880
Rym: and now today I mean Scott and Emily and I live in literally one of the only places in North America You can live and not own a car and even then not all the parts of this place can be lived in without a car

457
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,004
Scott: Even the rest of the world.

458
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:22,060
Scott: somehow this problem spread because I guess you know they looked at us as a model.

459
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,692
Scott: We did invent the car right the Model T and whatnot.

460
00:32:25,772 --> 00:32:26,776
Scott: so you know.

461
00:32:26,816 --> 00:32:32,975
Scott: but the rest of the world pretty much You know copied the model of America like oh you want to be awesome like America got have roads everywhere.

462
00:32:33,337 --> 00:32:41,373
Rym: so Gothamist Which is basically you should not read the Gothamist unless you live in New York But if you live in New York you will get the wrong idea about New York.

463
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:47,880
Scott: if you read this without living here if you Live here, then you will understand these articles the way they are meant to be understood.

464
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:53,418
Rym: These articles are this is real, New York for New Yorkers and literally not that context.

465
00:32:53,458 --> 00:33:02,620
Rym: you don't live here It's not for you Yeah But they recently had that they linked to the survey of like average bus speeds in New York two miles an hour.

466
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,033
Rym: Yeah, so they listed like the buses in terms of how fast and slow they go.

467
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:18,879
Rym: a good number of buses average less than two miles an hour yep meaning I Walk faster than most buses in New York.

468
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,490
Rym: yep, and these are the buses I would take to like go cross town.

469
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:30,903
Rym: I mean I remember once I was walking to the Javits for a New York comic-con and My options were fucking walk there or take the m42 bus soon.

470
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:32,528
Rym: We'll have a new option the m42 go.

471
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:34,400
Rym: yeah No, because we'll ever be m34.

472
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,433
Rym: no I mean the m42.

473
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:41,870
Rym: okay take the m42 across 42nd Street all the way to the end and then walk down a little bit.

474
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:42,975
Rym: You get to the top of the Javits.

475
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:52,050
Rym: okay way more convenient than taking the m32 all the way across or Taking the e train to Penn or whatever and then walk into that fucking underpass and then walking forever.

476
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:53,716
Rym: And I remember I was walking.

477
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:54,319
Rym: I was walking.

478
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:54,942
Rym: I was walking.

479
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:56,168
Rym: I saw the m42 bus.

480
00:33:56,671 --> 00:34:01,544
Rym: I was like oh, maybe I'll just get on that That'll get me there faster, and then I like didn't have a metro car.

481
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:02,610
Rym: and I was like yeah, whatever fuck it.

482
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,959
Rym: So I just kept walking and yeah, I beat the bus there in fact.

483
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:09,629
Rym: I passed a second m42 bus while I was walking mm-hmm.

484
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:15,230
Rym: So buses in New York are useless and the few people who have to commute on buses.

485
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:18,525
Rym: I feel really bad for you if I had to commute on a bus in New York.

486
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:20,579
Rym: I'd buy a car Mm-hmm like for real.

487
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,909
Rym: I'd buy a car yeah.

488
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,936
Scott: So the last time I tried to take the city bus The subway wasn't working.

489
00:34:28,137 --> 00:34:28,920
Scott: it wasn't going up.

490
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:29,222
Scott: You know.

491
00:34:29,242 --> 00:34:33,215
Scott: so I was here basically at rims house Effectively same area.

492
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:36,847
Scott: oh yeah, and the subway would not go north to where I live.

493
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:37,889
Scott: so there's only two lines.

494
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:38,634
Rym: They go where you live.

495
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:41,210
Scott: there's a bus that actually takes a more direct route.

496
00:34:41,603 --> 00:34:43,860
Rym: Yeah The bus that Emily always wants us to take to visit Scott.

497
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:49,190
Rym: because on you know the buses route goes Literally right from our apartment to like right next to Scott's house like it's great.

498
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,029
Scott: Yeah, if you take the subway the subway is a bit east from both of us.

499
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:54,161
Scott: So I have to.

500
00:34:54,303 --> 00:35:04,050
Scott: then if I take the subway Which is what I usually take I then have to walk a bunch West to get to where I live the subway the bus Stops right at my apartment effectively like a block away.

501
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,528
Scott: So why not take this bus?

502
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:11,390
Scott: well I went over to take this bus and of course there was mad Crowding on the bus stop because no one could take the subway.

503
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,255
Scott: And they were trying to do this.

504
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:18,224
Scott: but even without that crowding The bus comes like once every 20 minutes or something.

505
00:35:18,404 --> 00:35:21,456
Scott: the subway comes like every Five minutes even less than that.

506
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:25,850
Rym: yeah during rush hour a seven train comes every make a train comes in the train goes out another train.

507
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:32,180
Scott: Yeah, like there's a train queued up to come in as soon as the next train land the train carries a zillion people and the bus Carries like 50 people at best.

508
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,869
Scott: That's a crowded ass bus with 50 people.

509
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:36,519
Scott: Oh, yeah, you're lucky Maybe 30 people.

510
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:40,935
Rym: and even then when you get on a bus This is the read that the biggest problem I have with buses.

511
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:46,317
Rym: and why even if we fix a lot of the problems with buses this Fundamental flaw makes buses still a bad idea.

512
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:50,970
Rym: do to ride a bus that you don't ride every single day.

513
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:57,446
Rym: You have to pay attention For much of the time you're on the bus to make sure you get off at the right place.

514
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:59,274
Rym: you have to know the neighborhood You're going to.

515
00:35:59,314 --> 00:36:01,506
Scott: you have to know where the bus stop is and push the thing.

516
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,961
Rym: it's not like the bus Tells you where it is.

517
00:36:04,022 --> 00:36:04,790
Rym: you have to look out the way.

518
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,170
Scott: I'll be like stop something something we are currently at this stop.

519
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:08,832
Scott: You know.

520
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:15,771
Scott: you get to like know the bus route like it requires a lot of specialized knowledge And didn't be able to ride the bus It's not.

521
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:21,743
Rym: or you have to sit and stare at your phone on the GPS and like watch it until you figure out where you Are and then get off at the right spot keep

522
00:36:21,784 --> 00:36:28,930
Scott: looking out the window And you see a stop and you're pretty close to where you want to be and you're like well Do I get off here or will the bus stop even closer?

523
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:36,403
Scott: I don't know the streetcar the tram like even if I stay on it for you know it's like okay I'm really close to where I am now if I stay on how far past.

524
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:38,030
Scott: where I want to go is the next stop.

525
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:39,797
Rym: Yep, but like a tram network.

526
00:36:39,817 --> 00:36:42,047
Rym: leaving in Melbourne like we were there for Pax Australia last year.

527
00:36:42,087 --> 00:36:44,528
Rym: the tram network There is super extensive, but you know what?

528
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,830
Rym: Every station like you knew exactly where you were getting on and off.

529
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,858
Rym: It was really easy to actually ride it.

530
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,288
Rym: as a result you didn't have to pay attention the whole time yep.

531
00:36:54,272 --> 00:36:58,590
Rym: So buses are super uncomfortable to ride from the fact that you can't just zone out on the subway.

532
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:02,850
Rym: They go from predefined places to other predefined places.

533
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:11,990
Rym: You can look at the subway map and immediately know how to get from point A to point B and take a nap Exactly and then get wake up and get off because a thing goes bong.

534
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:15,081
Rym: The next station will be Grand Central terminal.

535
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:16,245
Rym: blah blah blah blah blah.

536
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:17,609
Rym: You know exactly where you are.

537
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:26,430
Rym: Also the Subways are just generally way faster because they don't get stuck in any traffic other than subway traffic.

538
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:30,122
Scott: Yeah, they're also way faster because they're giant awesome trains.

539
00:37:30,142 --> 00:37:35,035
Rym: Yep, and they hold a bazillion people Also energy efficient.

540
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:36,360
Scott: Yeah, let's talk about looting.

541
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:40,695
Scott: well some electric buses out there like Seattle has the Catenary buses.

542
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:46,155
Scott: yeah those buses and a lot of buses in New York are all like Hybrid electric butts.

543
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:51,429
Rym: it's yeah, so they can recapture all that braking when they stop at every intersection for an hour.

544
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:53,455
Scott: yes Exactly sometimes.

545
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:55,783
Scott: There's a bus only lane on certain roads also.

546
00:37:55,823 --> 00:37:57,809
Scott: There's no one's ever parked in that or biking in it.

547
00:37:58,271 --> 00:37:59,536
Rym: There is another problem.

548
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:00,198
Rym: That's kind of the.

549
00:38:01,523 --> 00:38:07,442
Rym: it's a touchy subject to bring up But it needs to be talked about because the buses suck.

550
00:38:07,963 --> 00:38:13,101
Rym: the buses are primarily used by lowers those Geoeconomic strata in most places in the u.s..

551
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:13,282
Scott: Well.

552
00:38:13,342 --> 00:38:17,133
Scott: No, it's because the buses Well are.

553
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,317
Scott: so in areas

554
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:18,858
Rym: it has

555
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:29,202
Scott: 22 yes in areas where people who don't have a lot of money live They don't build awesome subways, and if they do build an awesome subway there it gentrifies And those people get kicked out of that neighborhood

556
00:38:29,323 --> 00:38:30,410
Rym: like they just added a new subway.

557
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:37,730
Scott: So on the seven line if you buy the Javits if you don't have a lot of money You can't really live in an area that's convenient by subway very easily.

558
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:40,822
Scott: So the only thing that's gonna help you in your area is bus.

559
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:44,490
Scott: oh and by the way you're poor So you can't buy a car or anything.

560
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:57,490
Rym: So it is not a lie to say that in most parts of New York and most parts of America Buses are ridden by people who don't have a lot of money, which is highly correlated with things like crime.

561
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:04,450
Rym: So a lot of shitty things happen on buses way more frequently than they happen on subways and trains.

562
00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:06,337
Rym: Yep, that's so.

563
00:39:06,497 --> 00:39:07,802
Rym: as a result as a person.

564
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:09,970
Rym: I really try to avoid riding buses.

565
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:13,930
Rym: That is one of the many reasons why I try to avoid your wealth privilege.

566
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,738
Scott: Yes, you don't have to ride the bus.

567
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:16,964
Scott: exactly poor people.

568
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,915
Rym: if the subway isn't running I'll actually just take a cab.

569
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:24,109
Scott: and if you did ride the bus you wouldn't have to ride in the back because you're white.

570
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:32,323
Scott: What too soon Yeah, so I prefer the back of the bus.

571
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:34,110
Scott: I never knew why anyone thought the front was better.

572
00:39:34,231 --> 00:39:35,368
Rym: Well, what about it?

573
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:36,873
Rym: School buses?

574
00:39:36,893 --> 00:39:41,070
Rym: the back of the bus is the best bus driver can't fucking get you and you're back there.

575
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:41,313
Rym: Let's try.

576
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,710
Scott: ever can't get you even if you're in the front seat.

577
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,317
Scott: What are they gonna do?

578
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:44,470
Scott: get up and stop driving?

579
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:49,464
Rym: You can rate how cool a kid is in the United States by how far back they're sitting.

580
00:39:49,484 --> 00:39:56,290
Rym: the coolest kid in any middle school Is the one sitting in that short seat next to the emergency exit at the back by himself?

581
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,865
Scott: Yep, that is then when they get off the bus to go home They open up that emergency exit and jump out.

582
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:02,610
Scott: and don't give a fuck.

583
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,457
Rym: Yeah, the bus drivers like get back here.

584
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:06,926
Scott: Jimmy Joe it's like I'm in my house motherfucker.

585
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:07,750
Scott: what you can do about it?

586
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,076
Rym: Good what you're gonna write my head.

587
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:11,407
Scott: You're gonna pick my ass up to go to school tomorrow.

588
00:40:11,427 --> 00:40:12,010
Scott: That's what you can do.

589
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:14,666
Scott: Yep, you know, I'm about to play Nintendo games.

590
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:20,207
Rym: Whoo Yeah, the kids sitting in the gimpy short seat at the back of a middle school bus is cock-fucking-robin.

591
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:25,290
Scott: That's right Because if he wasn't the kid who was it beat him up and kick him out and get him.

592
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:34,649
Rym: Though it's complicated because then after you get a few seats up the kids who were like three or four rows up are the least Cool kids who are trying to be with the cool kids.

593
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:41,855
Rym: Yeah And then at the way front are the cool kids who are smart and don't want to be bullied by the shitheads near the back The middle distance.

594
00:40:41,915 --> 00:40:45,270
Scott: people are just like the normal kids who don't give a fuck about social whatever.

595
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,655
Scott: They're just going to school and they're out.

596
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,059
Scott: Those are the normal cool people.

597
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,541
Scott: Yeah.

598
00:40:48,922 --> 00:40:51,390
Rym: Anyway, anyway, that's that's a lesson in middle school.

599
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:58,370
Rym: So there are some buses that are quality like the Express buses that go directly from like a neighborhood in Connecticut to Midtown, right?

600
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,810
Scott: Well, I mean those are okay, but they're like, you know, for example the boat bus, right?

601
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:05,172
Rym: It's it's a bus is barely tolerable and getting worse It's.

602
00:41:05,252 --> 00:41:08,470
Scott: uh, I mean it is getting worse, but it's at least you know, it gets the job done.

603
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,650
Scott: I need to get to that city for an extremely low price.

604
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:17,109
Scott: It will mostly much more safely than say shady Chinatown bus which are all gone now.

605
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:22,595
Scott: Yes, thankfully take me to that city in a reasonable fashion I won't have to.

606
00:41:22,736 --> 00:41:25,750
Scott: a lot of the problems that you talked about don't exist on there.

607
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:32,030
Rym: Like the few times he took mega buses like shit like a couple of times shit went down when I was not a mega bus.

608
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,495
Rym: that Would not have happened on a bolt bus.

609
00:41:33,656 --> 00:41:37,390
Scott: Yep, but functionally the reason is you have to buy your boat bus ticket on internet.

610
00:41:37,673 --> 00:41:43,873
Rym: yep, and somehow people haven't figured out how to get that fries a Priority boarding.

611
00:41:44,013 --> 00:41:44,193
Rym: Yep.

612
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:47,362
Rym: The answer is if you buy it online you get a.

613
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:51,576
Scott: no you get a. if you register and log into the Bolt bus website then buy the ticket.

614
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:56,565
Scott: if you just buy the ticket as like a guest without logging in then you don't get a. You get B or C.

615
00:41:56,767 --> 00:42:03,273
Rym: and meanwhile I was amazed at all these people who like line up without a ticket like trying to get onto the bus in case someone like Doesn't show up.

616
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:03,755
Rym: Mm-hmm.

617
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:07,390
Rym: Like everywhere I travel like at airports at train stations.

618
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:12,786
Rym: So many people are at an airport or a train station on standby.

619
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:14,270
Scott: I don't understand how that happens.

620
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:15,930
Scott: I've never had to be on standby in my life.

621
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:23,492
Rym: The only time I was ever on standby was when the only time I can airlines like all their staff went on strike and they canceled Every flight.

622
00:42:23,613 --> 00:42:31,820
Scott: the only time I can imagine this happening is literally if my flight got canceled in which case I would go to the Counter and be like look my flight was canceled.

623
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,824
Scott: I gave you fucking money.

624
00:42:32,844 --> 00:42:34,230
Scott: You're gonna fly me where I want to go.

625
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:35,375
Scott: When is that gonna happen?

626
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:40,071
Scott: And they would tell me if they said I don't know I would go to a hotel Immediately.

627
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:45,832
Scott: Yeah, and then wait and make phone calls when appropriate and cetera until you know We had Scott.

628
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:51,970
Rym: that is that is the privilege of someone who has money and is willing to suffer any amount of financial.

629
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:58,910
Scott: I'm gonna make them pay for that hotel room - yeah, I'm not paying for that and then follow it up with righteous indignation.

630
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:00,450
Scott: Yes, exactly.

631
00:43:00,993 --> 00:43:04,090
Scott: So, I mean, there's no reason me to stand at the airport on standby for anything.

632
00:43:04,474 --> 00:43:06,050
Scott: I guess there could be some emergency.

633
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:06,413
Scott: We're like.

634
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:11,906
Scott: I just have to get to Saskatchewan like it like today and then there's no way I could buy it.

635
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:12,930
Scott: I just gotta go to the airport.

636
00:43:13,032 --> 00:43:14,148
Rym: No, you know what I would do.

637
00:43:14,706 --> 00:43:17,701
Rym: I Like if you can't like if you can't fly and like standbys.

638
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:21,137
Rym: not I'm the kind of person who's rent a car and drive Right out of the airport.

639
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,103
Scott: we could do that.

640
00:43:22,305 --> 00:43:25,433
Rym: Yeah, I did From here.

641
00:43:25,453 --> 00:43:32,064
Rym: Yeah, if we drove in shifts we could be there and if I had to guess two or three days No, we could do a faster than that.

642
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:33,353
Scott: if I need to be there I drove.

643
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:34,337
Rym: we fucking.

644
00:43:34,377 --> 00:43:40,041
Rym: it takes two days to drive from Detroit to like the middle of Florida If you drive in shifts and with some sleeping.

645
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:44,755
Rym: so we could totally get to Saskatchewan Inside of two days.

646
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:48,190
Scott: if we drove in shifts and never saw this mad bad weather right now, and it's Canada.

647
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,241
Rym: Yeah, Canada knows that deal with bad weather.

648
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:51,904
Rym: I grew up in Michigan.

649
00:43:51,925 --> 00:43:53,050
Rym: I could drive in bad weather's fine.

650
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,530
Rym: Where are we gonna rent a car that has snow chains in the trunk?

651
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,997
Rym: Do you know how to put snow chains on?

652
00:43:59,258 --> 00:44:01,969
Scott: I know how to Google and watch a YouTube video showing me how to do it.

653
00:44:02,652 --> 00:44:07,250
Rym: So the you know, it's funny because you brought up bolt bus and like I said mega bus and all these things.

654
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,415
Rym: There's another bus like that.

655
00:44:08,636 --> 00:44:11,770
Rym: In fact, I'm riding one on Saturday urban Sherpa in New York.

656
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:19,139
Rym: I can pay somebody like 60 bucks and they will at 6 a.m You pay 60 bucks for that.

657
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,285
Scott: now, I don't feel bad about things.

658
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,190
Scott: I've wasted 60 bucks.

659
00:44:21,413 --> 00:44:32,678
Rym: They picked me up in Times Square Drive me to Hunter Mountain and drop me off at the ski mountain and then at 4 30 p.m Drive me back to Times Square and drop me off.

660
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,890
Scott: There's no white privilege bus like a bus going to a ski resort.

661
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:43,870
Rym: So from New York City, this is what I'm getting at New York's like bolt bus kind of like jet-blue all these things.

662
00:44:44,753 --> 00:44:48,149
Rym: They exist because of New York, they don't exist anywhere else.

663
00:44:48,832 --> 00:44:49,895
Scott: I'm sure they exist somewhere else.

664
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:50,978
Scott: new most cities

665
00:44:51,038 --> 00:45:07,997
Rym: do not have the kinds of buses that we have access to here Mmm, like if you want to take a bus to somewhere outside of New York That isn't serviced by like bolt bus one almost no one goes there and two you're on fucking Peter Pan and that bus is just a Eight-hour nightmare.

666
00:45:08,037 --> 00:45:09,284
Scott: Yeah something else though.

667
00:45:09,324 --> 00:45:15,188
Scott: I think other countries Some of them, you know, especially the nice ones have much better buses than we have.

668
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,415
Rym: Yes, they do That is true.

669
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:22,240
Scott: If we if we go to like Asia's or Europe's or you know places like that.

670
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:25,230
Scott: I'm sure that they have buses that are like they go on.

671
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,929
Rym: Hey, we're just talking about American buses.

672
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,666
Scott: Yeah, well, it's a lot of those are just indicative of the.

673
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:33,021
Scott: you know You can see how just talking about one thing the bus.

674
00:45:33,342 --> 00:45:35,230
Scott: We're really just talking about the problems of America.

675
00:45:36,073 --> 00:45:40,017
Scott: Yeah, they're just all appear on the bus To get more.

676
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:43,349
Rym: because I was talking about like the privilege of these buses networks we have in New York.

677
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:49,716
Rym: our Friends like we go to conventions and we take bolt bus to a lot of the conventions we go to because it's just like it Goes.

678
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:54,790
Rym: it's the best way It'll pick us up in New York and go directly to like the convention.

679
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:58,430
Scott: So the bus that goes to Boston is pretty much a few blocks away from PAX East.

680
00:45:58,632 --> 00:45:59,522
Scott: Yes, you can walk.

681
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,150
Scott: it's so great.

682
00:46:00,411 --> 00:46:09,686
Rym: Our friends are all like oh how you guys get into PAX and for them taking a bus is a nightmare Because both bus doesn't go direct from where they live to Boston.

683
00:46:09,706 --> 00:46:10,750
Scott: Yeah, we live in New York City.

684
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:21,787
Scott: They live like even if you live in White Plains pretty close to New York City You're gonna what you knew you did come to New York City on Metro north and then take but it's like and there's no transportation directly from there too.

685
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:29,922
Rym: So instead like pretty much for all of them driving is the best option except then they got a park and park is like 60 Bucks a day for like Boston.

686
00:46:29,963 --> 00:46:33,868
Rym: Yeah 60 bucks a day is a pretty low-end price.

687
00:46:33,908 --> 00:46:39,350
Scott: to park Bus cost me like me possibly $1 each way if I buy my ticket early enough.

688
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:41,980
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I usually like 12 bucks each way.

689
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,265
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

690
00:46:43,286 --> 00:46:56,370
Rym: So so Buses work like there's buses and all these mass transit options related to buses that we have here Don't exist in most of the rest of New York because there is such a demand for mass transit.

691
00:46:57,074 --> 00:47:03,924
Rym: But at the same time we won't build it and as a result buses For the vast majority of humans who will ever ride them who don't live in New York City.

692
00:47:04,345 --> 00:47:05,448
Rym: fucking nightmares.

693
00:47:05,649 --> 00:47:15,070
Rym: Yep Yep, like I if my only option is a bus I either won't go or I'll rent a car most of the time and most of the country.

694
00:47:15,552 --> 00:47:18,321
Scott: Right pretty much anywhere you live in the United States.

695
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:23,030
Scott: Like I don't think there's been a civilized place I've lived where there isn't actually like a bus system.

696
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:38,330
Scott: it's like there's no other public transportation usually except outside of major cities, but even near my parents house or You know out in all kinds of middle-of-nowhere places There's still some sort of bus system and some sort of bus stop like remember we live in Rochester, right?

697
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,420
Rym: Remember when we didn't have a car as freshman we wanted by.

698
00:47:41,461 --> 00:47:43,990
Scott: Rochester doesn't have a subway or anything, but they have buses.

699
00:47:44,372 --> 00:47:48,929
Rym: Yeah, it would take us half a day to buy groceries by using that bus.

700
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:53,550
Rym: That bus took for fucking ever and then we had to carry all our groceries on the bus.

701
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,519
Scott: It was awful, but we did a lot.

702
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,870
Scott: Yeah, and it sucked but Wegmans was nice.

703
00:47:58,272 --> 00:48:01,345
Rym: And then you know as soon as we were sophomores, I had a car.

704
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:07,212
Rym: I drove Everyone we knew to the grocery store Everyone.

705
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:11,890
Rym: repeatedly I was I bought me driving people around was how I afforded gas.

706
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:19,960
Rym: so But beyond that our friend Luke, I remember he was like, ah, the bus is fine You need to own a car in Rochester.

707
00:48:20,262 --> 00:48:22,949
Rym: and then one day I was like Luke How long does it take you to get to work?

708
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,761
Rym: How long does it actually take you door-to-door?

709
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:30,600
Rym: and he was like like an hour and a half It's not that bad and one he was lying.

710
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,790
Rym: It actually took like two and a half hours and two.

711
00:48:34,732 --> 00:48:36,009
Rym: It sucked and he hated it.

712
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:38,219
Rym: But he couldn't admit to it because he already committed to this.

713
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,524
Scott: buses are okay position and if you use the car to make that Trip, it was like 15 minutes.

714
00:48:42,605 --> 00:48:46,035
Rym: Yeah If there's traffic 20 minutes.

715
00:48:46,075 --> 00:48:50,130
Scott: Yeah, if there's you can pretty much cross all of Rochester in like a half hour.

716
00:48:50,251 --> 00:48:52,543
Rym: Yeah, like it took us half a day to do grocery shopping.

717
00:48:53,166 --> 00:49:03,570
Rym: I could drive To the Wegmans and back including grocery shopping 10 15 minutes Including the grocery shopping 45 minutes, maybe how many groceries you getting?

718
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:07,690
Scott: I mean like I'm talking like you're getting an orangey and running out so that I'll get an orgy running out.

719
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,864
Rym: I would just drive to.

720
00:49:09,893 --> 00:49:12,629
Scott: Actually, the Wegmans you went to didn't have any orangey.

721
00:49:14,132 --> 00:49:16,709
Rym: That's a different Wegmans and that usually took all night.

722
00:49:19,878 --> 00:49:20,668
Rym: Then again in the morning.

723
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:35,030
