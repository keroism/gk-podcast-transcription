1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,356
Rym: It's Monday August 25th 2014.

2
00:00:10,356 --> 00:00:17,835
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight Electricity it's all Rym.

3
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:21,209
Scott: Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:40,236
Rym: Well, I sort of realized that Despite the fact that we thought oh, you know We got a bunch of free time tons of episodes tons of GeekNights and then packs I kind of forgot that after packs I got a fly like all over the goddamn world and gonna miss a bunch of shows.

5
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:51,936
Rym: because of packs OS and a bunch of weddings and An FPL show in Singapore and swinging through Istanbul and London I guess I'll be able to play a lot of netrunner in.

6
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:55,900
Rym: yeah I should leave everything set up so you and Emily can do the show while I'm gone.

7
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,256
Rym: Yeah, you guys could totally pull it off or I could just play netrunner.

8
00:00:59,577 --> 00:01:06,663
Rym: Yeah So, uh the other day is biking to work right and I felt as is tradition That's what I talk about

9
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:07,506
Scott: and

10
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:14,189
Rym: I'm just going really fucking slow and I feel really tired and old man Which occasionally happens like you're

11
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:16,280
Scott: using like this top gear for no for accident

12
00:01:16,582 --> 00:01:29,102
Rym: No, so I was using my normal gears and I'm just really tired And I'm like I made an okay time like Strava was like, yeah You were like three minutes longer than I just felt like shit the whole way going in and I felt like I really struggled Over the bridges.

13
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:31,290
Rym: so I kind of write it off.

14
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,153
Rym: I get extra coffee.

15
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:32,614
Rym: I'm at work.

16
00:01:32,654 --> 00:01:34,159
Rym: I do my thing on the way home.

17
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:37,313
Rym: I also ride like shit and I feel like crap.

18
00:01:37,353 --> 00:01:38,540
Rym: It's just like this terrible ride.

19
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:46,463
Rym: So I go to bed early and the next morning I get up and I start to bike and again I feel like crap.

20
00:01:46,964 --> 00:01:49,492
Rym: So I decide that something's wrong.

21
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:51,197
Scott: which part of your body felt like crap?

22
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:53,159
Scott: my legs Okay.

23
00:01:53,621 --> 00:02:01,020
Rym: Before I had maybe I had thought that maybe I'd worn myself out from like rock climbing and like my muscles just needed a day To recuperate or maybe I was getting sick.

24
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:09,309
Rym: but I start to bike again and It's just really hard to go up this hill and I look down and it says I'm in the gear I expect myself to be in.

25
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:17,832
Rym: and then I sort of Decide that maybe something's wrong with my bike because I hadn't inspected the bike previously because on the bike to work I was in a hurry.

26
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:20,509
Rym: I had to get to work I had a meeting and on the bike home.

27
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,096
Rym: I was in a hurry to get home.

28
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:23,060
Rym: so we could like do GeekNights.

29
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,686
Rym: So now I'm not in a hurry.

30
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:28,639
Rym: So I immediately stopped and I get off and I start inspecting the bike.

31
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:33,237
Rym: I expected that maybe like the gear shifter was off or something.

32
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:41,080
Rym: sure enough The gear indicator in the front was four gears off from what was going on in the back.

33
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:44,000
Scott: Well, I would notice that pretty much immediately.

34
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:46,892
Scott: I know what a gear feels like I do.

35
00:02:46,952 --> 00:02:52,395
Scott: but if it says that it's in like, you know A certain gear and it's pedaling is much more difficult than what it says.

36
00:02:52,415 --> 00:02:54,910
Scott: I Would notice that within seconds.

37
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,239
Scott: How could you not notice that?

38
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,033
Rym: Well, I have a very different gearing.

39
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:02,810
Scott: if you look at what I do Are your four gears off from where you're supposed to be?

40
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,914
Scott: I wouldn't notice.

41
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:05,600
Scott: I wouldn't think something is wrong with my body.

42
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:06,253
Scott: I would look at.

43
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:16,238
Rym: the Thing is I would have noticed if I'd gotten to a higher gear But my highest gears are basically unusable unless I'm going like 30 miles an hour plus.

44
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,970
Rym: so Really never get up that high.

45
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,800
Rym: and it was only on the bike to work.

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,872
Rym: So it was the bike to work in a hurry bike home hurry next day.

47
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:24,474
Rym: It's like oh shit.

48
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,097
Rym: What's going on?

49
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:31,480
Rym: So I look and And Because it's off by four and because of the direction it's off It's higher rather than lower.

50
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:36,540
Rym: I think it must be that like the cable got frayed or something near the cassette, but that's all fine.

51
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:41,180
Rym: So I go to the front and I investigate a little bit and what I discover is that the cable had not snapped.

52
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:45,600
Rym: Usually when the gears are off like that is because the cable just like snaps and you can't ship.

53
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,920
Scott: I thought it's off usually because the cables too tight or too loose or the changes gets moved and doesn't move back.

54
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:56,820
Rym: So what had happened was the cable like half the strands had snapped.

55
00:03:57,201 --> 00:04:00,791
Rym: So the rest of the cable just elongated by a couple centimeters.

56
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:01,633
Scott: Mm-hmm.

57
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:03,980
Rym: So it just kind of jiggered everything off.

58
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,800
Rym: So I wasn't about to fix that.

59
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,120
Rym: I do no longer have any of the equipment to fix that on my bike to replace the whole cable.

60
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:13,274
Rym: So I just replaced the cable at the bike shop.

61
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:14,842
Rym: They charged me $11.

62
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:16,026
Scott: That's about right.

63
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:23,822
Rym: Yeah, and then the next day when I had it all fixed my bike to work I beat my Strava time over both bridges Mm-hmm.

64
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:24,826
Rym: It happens.

65
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:26,152
Rym: Yeah, that's all I got.

66
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:27,096
Scott: I beat the time for you.

67
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:27,699
Scott: I beat my time.

68
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:33,879
Rym: today I am the a hundred and eighth fastest person to ever bike over the Williamsburg Bridge according to Strava.

69
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:37,052
Scott: I don't know where my rank is on the Queensborough Bridge.

70
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,060
Rym: Well, look at one of those like bridge.

71
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,066
Rym: There's all these different routes.

72
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,580
Scott: So it's like a whole bunch of different bridge routes.

73
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,724
Scott: I don't know which one's the real one.

74
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:45,952
Scott: one of them says actual Queensborough Bridge.

75
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:48,200
Scott: one says full Queensborough Bridge.

76
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,380
Scott: Yeah, you realize on the ones like Queensborough Bridge West Climb.

77
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,292
Scott: But it's like two of those.

78
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:56,520
Rym: Yeah Cuz people like to have their stats like just on the climb just on the descent.

79
00:04:57,204 --> 00:04:58,030
Scott: Just it was.

80
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,440
Scott: cares who's fastest on the descent.

81
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:02,192
Scott: I could probably toward a front speed on the descent.

82
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:04,923
Scott: if no one's in the way, he's gonna kill me Slow.

83
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:09,097
Rym: I would argue that you couldn't beat me because I have a higher gear ratio at the upper end.

84
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:12,197
Scott: It doesn't matter terminal velocity going down that hill.

85
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:17,880
Scott: What will matter is if your bike starts to shake and you just you know or break going that fast.

86
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,591
Rym: I have a race down the Williamsburg Bridge.

87
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:27,220
Scott: I Mean as it has to be at a time when there's no one in the way We should go over there some morning at like 7 in the morning on a weekend.

88
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:35,777
Scott: It'd be better to race down like a perfectly smooth hill somewhere in the middle of nowhere where there's no cars or people that to crash into and nothing and nothing at the end that you have to stop for.

89
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,705
Scott: because then Brakes also matter right.

90
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:44,233
Scott: a lot of the thing that limits my downhill speed is Actually brakes because I had to start braking way the fuck soon.

91
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:45,900
Scott: I don't get killed at the bottom.

92
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,706
Rym: Yeah, you know what I do.

93
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:53,379
Scott: if I had powerful brakes that were stable Then I could go ridiculously fast and brake pretty close to the end and still have a smooth stop.

94
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:57,113
Rym: You have mostly the same brakes I do.

95
00:05:57,656 --> 00:06:01,645
Scott: I mean they're V brakes But they're not friggin, you know Like ridiculously strong.

96
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:04,436
Scott: if I'm going downhill at like 30 miles an hour.

97
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:05,420
Scott: It takes a while to stop.

98
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,855
Scott: You can't just slam on them you go right over the handlebars and die.

99
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,519
Rym: You gotta feather them.

100
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,004
Scott: Yeah, it takes a while.

101
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:14,780
Scott: That's a whole bunch of distance that I basically can't have to stop accelerating.

102
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:17,425
Rym: I feel like we should bike down a hill together.

103
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,348
Rym: I want to see what you're doing breaking.

104
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:19,969
Scott: Well, I'm not.

105
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:32,476
Scott: I mean by Just be danger sense because you know No based on how we drive right when we drive when you drive a car you hit the brakes like Ridiculously close to the red light and then the car goes Shikanka Shikanka.

106
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:33,300
Scott: All right, and it jerks.

107
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,300
Rym: But are you sure you're not gonna see me for most of our friends?

108
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,920
Scott: Well, your our friends are worse than you, but you are still bad at it, right?

109
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,612
Scott: So basically everyone in the car is uncomfortably lurched forward.

110
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:49,000
Scott: when I break in any vehicle I break so smoothly that the car that the vehicle does not move forward.

111
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:53,137
Scott: You wouldn't even know that you had stopped and started because my acceleration is so smooth.

112
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:56,188
Scott: All right All right, so because of that right I'm breaking.

113
00:06:56,248 --> 00:07:03,640
Scott: probably or you know, I could break later safely if I was in a race But I do not do so because comfort is higher priority.

114
00:07:04,082 --> 00:07:08,040
Rym: Yeah, my only priority biking home is not one not dying to speed.

115
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:13,580
Scott: Yeah, also, you know I could break even harder and like get the brakes going squealing like I'm not doing that either.

116
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,731
Rym: If I break harder, my brakes don't squeal.

117
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,957
Rym: I just flip over the handlebars.

118
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:20,287
Scott: Well, I mean There's limits here for everything, right?

119
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:22,214
Scott: You also wear your brakes out more.

120
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,342
Scott: if you're you know breaking hard Who cares?

121
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:25,707
Rym: you replace your brake pads every year.

122
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:27,493
Scott: I don't place them every year.

123
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,325
Rym: I've replaced my brake pads every year No need to replace them.

124
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:32,900
Scott: Well, maybe when you overuse the brakes you need to replace.

125
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:34,940
Rym: So anyway, the other thing is out.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,011
Rym: So I was gonna bike to work today because like the most beautiful goddamn day.

127
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:44,940
Rym: and I didn't because as I'm rolling my bike out I see a mark on my tire like a long line a white line.

128
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:49,340
Rym: No, it's like it's like a lighter colored lines like a centimeter wide like eight centimeters long.

129
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:49,860
Rym: Okay.

130
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:58,972
Rym: and I remember seeing that yesterday when I look behind myself while I was biking for something and I saw like a line come around in The tire couple times like oh, I must have rolled through something.

131
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:00,500
Rym: So I saw it again.

132
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,427
Rym: I'm like, maybe I should inspect that I inspected.

133
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,660
Rym: It's the metal inside of my tire.

134
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,851
Rym: I've actually worn the entire tire down to the fact that it is.

135
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:13,240
Rym: it is like one bump away from exploding.

136
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,334
Scott: So I'm gonna be metal inside the tire.

137
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:17,400
Scott: Wouldn't it be your tube?

138
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:22,156
Rym: We use very different kinds of tires, I do not have tubes.

139
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,000
Scott: you don't have tubes.

140
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,510
Scott: You just have a solid piece of rubber.

141
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:25,880
Rym: Not a solid piece of rubber.

142
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:33,240
Rym: So my rear tire is a tubeless tire that just takes a high-pressure air inside of it and it seals against the Rym.

143
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,037
Rym: There's no additional tube in there.

144
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:42,260
Rym: All right, and independently I have worn the tire completely out almost all the way around.

145
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:49,020
Rym: I'm Really lucky that didn't blow out like last week because I must have worn it down like in the last eight or nine days.

146
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,015
Scott: Maybe you wouldn't brake so heavily you would have less friction of your tires in the ground.

147
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:53,020
Scott: It wouldn't wear out like that.

148
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:55,011
Rym: They only wear out like that from braking.

149
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:57,908
Rym: if you skid the tires Which I pretty much don't use.

150
00:08:57,948 --> 00:09:02,766
Scott: my rear tires still wear out from They from braking and accelerating.

151
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:05,834
Rym: yeah, the wear pattern is pretty much uniformly around.

152
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:10,351
Rym: there's another warm spot on the other side and Inspecting the entire tire.

153
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:11,259
Rym: It's basically worn out.

154
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,143
Rym: So I got to go.

155
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:16,459
Rym: this is now my fourth rear tire, and I'm still on the original front tire.

156
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,279
Rym: That is my biking story.

157
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:22,497
Rym: So you got any news?

158
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,531
Scott: Gigantic news saving the day.

159
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:26,938
Scott: so I have something to talk about.

160
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:31,595
Scott: The rumors were that YouTube was gonna buy twitch which is good news and bad news.

161
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:35,970
Rym: that would have been great news For me and bad news for a lot of other people.

162
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:42,249
Scott: so the good news of that was gonna be that you know YouTube streaming technology is vastly superior from these streamers.

163
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:46,059
Scott: end of things and we would have much enjoyed using YouTube streaming technology on twitch.

164
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,745
Scott: and No Twitch is crappy streaming.

165
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:54,379
Rym: there is a caveat that people who use twitch regularly seem to not like the YouTube one And I think it's because they don't use sophisticated software and don't know how it works.

166
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:55,729
Rym: But I digress.

167
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:57,240
Scott: having the preview alone.

168
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,328
Scott: And why would you say that having a preview is bad?

169
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:02,680
Scott: that feature alone regardless of other features that you know may?

170
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:13,043
Scott: Just make things harder, but if you don't know what you do, but it's not Natural like you got to get that whole setup like people like to see like the natural you want to see the unprofessional shit Yeah, go fuck yourself.

171
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:16,940
Scott: Yeah, all right, but it turns out that that didn't actually happen.

172
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,702
Scott: 100% confirmed real Let.

173
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:24,393
Scott: Amazon is buying twitch for about a billion dollars ish.

174
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:24,895
Scott: Yep.

175
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:26,660
Rym: Don't know how I feel about that.

176
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,970
Rym: that's gonna be interesting because I like Amazon from a Selfish human being who buys stuff perspective.

177
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:40,022
Rym: Oh, yeah, don't like Amazon from a corporate behavior Perspective.

178
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,370
Rym: they're not the worst.

179
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:42,275
Rym: don't get me wrong.

180
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:43,060
Rym: There are no months.

181
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,338
Scott: I mean the things I don't like about Amazon is I've heard rumors of bad stuff in their warehouses.

182
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:52,080
Rym: Yeah Lot not rumors of them bullying small book publishers, okay?

183
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,700
Scott: Well, okay, let's talk about bullying small and large book publishers, right?

184
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:57,860
Scott: So Amazon is just a retailer.

185
00:10:58,221 --> 00:11:02,157
Scott: They buy a book and they sell a book and they need to sell the book for a higher price.

186
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:04,779
Scott: and they buy it for Even though they don't sell anything for higher price.

187
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:07,672
Scott: But theoretically they have to do that right.

188
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:12,287
Scott: the book publisher is Refusing to lower the price of an e-book.

189
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:19,151
Scott: an e-book cost like 15 goddamn dollars for a right on Amazon Which means Amazon is paying what like 10 bucks or something.

190
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:25,798
Scott: you can get every song ever Spotify or whatever for 10 bucks a month.

191
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:29,449
Scott: Ebooks are worth about fucking five cents, right?

192
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,174
Scott: So Amazon is actually.

193
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:33,220
Scott: you think they're bullying small book publishers.

194
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:40,293
Scott: No, they're just fighting for fucking reality Which is I'm not gonna pay fifteen dollars for a goddamn book one.

195
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,580
Rym: you powered all your books anyway, so why do you even care?

196
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:46,100
Rym: The thing is those the marginal cost to Amazon or zero.

197
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,431
Rym: Why not just let them sell the ebooks at whatever price they want?

198
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:52,120
Rym: and if they don't sell because they're too expensive that's on them.

199
00:11:52,421 --> 00:12:03,420
Scott: Because Amazon does make money selling kindles because technology, you know Electronic devices are worth money and Amazon can't sell kindles if they don't have all these books on there.

200
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,560
Scott: So the Amazon wants to sell the books, but they can't if the books are too expensive.

201
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:12,040
Scott: No one's gonna buy a Kindle if all the books on there are 15 bucks.

202
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,739
Scott: They want the book prices to go down.

203
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:22,960
Rym: Is that buying a Kindle is worth it because then you can get the books for the same time I get the impression that Kindle is actually kind of petering out and being replaced by tablet Kindle fires.

204
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:26,189
Scott: Well Amazon was also smart in that regard.

205
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:31,864
Scott: right you can get just an Amazon Kindle app on an iPad or iPhone.

206
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:46,137
Rym: I see more and more people who are buying Tablets and then reading ebooks on tablets, but honestly having used both to read books the ink Whatever is way more comfortable than a backlit tablet screen to read pretty much anything.

207
00:12:46,478 --> 00:12:47,260
Rym: That's just text.

208
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:51,296
Scott: Okay, so I agree and also disagree at the same time, right?

209
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:55,149
Rym: So on the one hand Yes, also holding the Kindle in one hand is way lighter physically.

210
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:55,972
Rym: Let's agree.

211
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,660
Rym: Yeah, so I had the battery last like a month.

212
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:01,140
Scott: Yeah, so I have a Kindle and an iPad mini, right?

213
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:09,251
Scott: So the Kindle is indeed much more comfortable to read on if there is light adequate light Obviously and it's a lot and the weight definitely less.

214
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,259
Scott: battery way less, you know.

215
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,905
Scott: It's all those regards.

216
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:23,836
Scott: The Kindle is vastly superior, right and it can hold a ton of books because storage for books, whatever Right, but the iPad mini is superior in book reading in one regard.

217
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:24,698
Scott: Well two regards.

218
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:26,269
Rym: All right I'm curious to hear these.

219
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,140
Scott: one regard is that you know I'm comparing this to the ink Kindle not the Kindle fire.

220
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,191
Scott: Right because the Kindle fire is basically the same thing as the iPad right?

221
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:35,540
Scott: It's not really there in terms of book reading only, right?

222
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,880
Scott: The just being able to have the touchscreen with all that stuff that you can do instead of you know.

223
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,886
Scott: So if I want to do things like highlight and copy or all that kind of stuff that you just can't do, you know I can let you know what you know.

224
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:51,218
Rym: when I do that either from a PC or from a tablet I'm saying but you know not what I'm reading.

225
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,650
Scott: Sure, but I can you know, look a word up.

226
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,726
Scott: I can quickly go to a browser Look a word up.

227
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:58,596
Rym: You're saying you don't know the definitions of every word.

228
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,743
Scott: You don't know the Every word.

229
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:01,767
Scott: I have it.

230
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,032
Scott: Why are you working on Wall Street?

231
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:05,000
Scott: You can make a lot of money into playing Scrabble.

232
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:10,100
Rym: I would argue that knowing the definitions of every word would in no way help you in Scrabble.

233
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:17,040
Scott: The definitions know but by knowing by knowing the definitions that would imply you also know every word which would help you.

234
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,113
Rym: Scrabble players know every Scrabble word and that's all that matters.

235
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:20,475
Scott: Yes.

236
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:21,560
Scott: Well Scrabble words are words.

237
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:24,140
Scott: So if you knew the definitions of every word you would know every Scrabble word.

238
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:30,742
Scott: well Then I would just be at the same level as and there are ways you can make more money by knowing every word than Scrabble Regardless.

239
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:40,712
Rym: but my point being is that the problem with Amazon is that because they're pretty like they're not a monopoly but they're They're a monopoly on like online retail.

240
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:44,399
Scott: Yeah, and yes, that is a problem But the right is that where else can I go to buy?

241
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:51,667
Scott: You know I wish there was another place I could go to just buy everything I wanted online and then there would be a Competition and the prices would go down even further.

242
00:14:51,788 --> 00:15:07,358
Rym: not even just prices but service and things is the fact that I'm uncomfortable Any time there is one That has a primary control like, you know The dispute with the publishers over ebook prices would be a zero debate if there was any alternative.

243
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:08,662
Scott: the alternative They should have.

244
00:15:08,702 --> 00:15:14,120
Scott: just so they should just sell ebooks at a low price directly from their own website, but they're technologically incompetent.

245
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:22,985
Rym: Well selling from your own website is tough because even if you have your own e-commerce thing and it's perfect and it integrates perfectly With all the hardware out there.

246
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:27,899
Rym: It's really hard to convince people to go to those places Even if you have better deals.

247
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:35,962
Rym: I've seen games Cheaper on places other than steam and no one buys them on those places except little kids who spend all their time looking for those Deal, right?

248
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:37,892
Scott: Well, I mean this is a common thing that we see.

249
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:39,179
Scott: right is like Marvel and DC.

250
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:42,090
Scott: You don't buy comics from the Marvel and DC apps.

251
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:43,897
Scott: you buy it from the comics ology app.

252
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:50,060
Scott: some other company That's technologically competent had to do it because the companies that actually produce the content were too dumb to do it.

253
00:15:50,923 --> 00:16:00,180
Rym: Because Amazon, you know if it's the specialized market like, you know Grubhub is the specialized market for you want food right now, and they pretty much have a monopoly on that.

254
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:05,540
Rym: But with Amazon their original specialty was basically we're the specialty thing for books.

255
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:12,840
Scott: Then they become the specialty thing for everything because they had the technology and they're basically a technology service, right?

256
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,261
Scott: They're basic, you know It's like.

257
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:19,759
Scott: are you too dumb to sell things online and in a way on your own and no one's coming to you?

258
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,519
Scott: Well, we did you know, it's like they were just being like.

259
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:27,939
Scott: well We can sell things online because you have warehouses and we have shipping and we have a little what I would do.

260
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:28,885
Scott: So we'll do it.

261
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:31,260
Scott: Oh wait, we're suddenly selling everything online.

262
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,050
Scott: So now this side effect happened, which is really benefiting.

263
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:42,819
Rym: if I were going to compete with Amazon I wouldn't try to compete with them on the everything store because that's impossible Obviously compete with just one of their stores.

264
00:16:43,020 --> 00:17:01,560
Rym: What I would do is partner with like Kickstarter and things like that to have their ebook store integrated because obviously it is difficult to sell any Copyrighted IP media in any form because of the whole supply and demand thing.

265
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:04,193
Scott: I think the way to compete with something like Amazon is the same way.

266
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,861
Scott: you compete with something like reddit Right?

267
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:09,800
Scott: is you pick just one area and do that area better than they do it.

268
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,589
Scott: So like you can't make a reddit that has you know Just every community but you could make like a gaming.

269
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:25,576
Scott: only reddit like stack stack overflow is an example of it's sort of Thingy going on but that will stack exchange right everything sure but it competes in just like this one area.

270
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:30,490
Scott: the question answer area Right, and if you look Amazon isn't really selling everything online.

271
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:33,760
Scott: steam is competing with it in the one area of games.

272
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:42,495
Scott: right, even GOG competes with steam in the one area of old games and New egg competes with Amazon in the area of computer shit.

273
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:45,266
Rym: that is true though increasingly I find better deals on Amazon.

274
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:52,956
Scott: just sometimes but not always but sometimes I'll buy from new egg Even if the deal is similar because new egg is so much easier to search for computer parts specifically.

275
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:54,080
Rym: That is true, right?

276
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,328
Scott: It's if you pick just one area someone who's doing it generically Right isn't serving that.

277
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:13,779
Scott: you know niche market so you can like, you know Etsy can compete right because they're honing in on just one area of e-commerce and doing that better than Amazon can do it because Amazon has to worry about every kind of e-commerce and can't just worry about one.

278
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:20,000
Scott: Yeah But Amazon also in addition to selling every goddamn thing in the universe also specializes in books.

279
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:29,940
Scott: So it's very very hard to compete with books as your as your target thing Because they specialize in it and simultaneous have the resources of selling everything.

280
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,139
Rym: But the point of all that is that you need to have some competition to force people to make features better.

281
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:42,141
Rym: Very few companies will make features better or user experiences better unless they're forced to out of fear That is.

282
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:51,772
Scott: one interesting thing is while that is true and you can see it in the cable industry if you don't believe it's yeah Amazon strangely keeps acting like they have competition.

283
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:58,333
Scott: when they don't I keep lowering Prices and they keep serving the people who are their customers really?

284
00:18:58,394 --> 00:19:00,360
Scott: Well, it's like oh you have Amazon Prime here.

285
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:01,817
Scott: Just watch all these videos for free.

286
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:12,271
Rym: Up until about a year and a half ago whenever I ordered anything from Amazon I always picked super saver and you know what everything always arrived like the next day.

287
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:22,800
Rym: Mm-hmm now everything arrives at the far Maximum end of the period is eight days minimum if I do super saver, but oh I can just pay for prime.

288
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,208
Rym: They're really trying to push everyone toward prime.

289
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:26,753
Scott: Yeah, but I pay for prime.

290
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:27,516
Scott: It's not that much money.

291
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:29,365
Rym: It's really pays for prime So I don't have to.

292
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:30,513
Scott: yeah, I mean, it's really great.

293
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:31,460
Scott: It's totally awesome.

294
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:36,740
Scott: Why you know, I mean, it's not like they're ripping you off with it Like some other people are ripping you off of stuff.

295
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:41,492
Rym: So YouTube has far superior technology compared to twitch.

296
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:43,256
Scott: and for the people who are doing the streaming.

297
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:57,360
Rym: Yes, but Well that yeah, but even even for the consumer of it that what they did things differently the community stuff and Google all sucks, obviously Yeah, so and they don't really give good ways for streamers to monetize.

298
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,140
Rym: But personally I don't really care about that aspect of it.

299
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:05,744
Scott: No the two things that Bob the only two things I think are wrong with the YouTube streaming right now is Number one.

300
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,514
Scott: you have to set a start time and it counts down.

301
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:10,260
Scott: the set time doesn't have to be accurate.

302
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,387
Scott: You can start whenever you want.

303
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,700
Scott: You can start after or before the clock hits zero.

304
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:19,400
Scott: You can't even change the clock whenever you want Yeah, but it while before your stream starts that clock is there counting down.

305
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,970
Scott: I like that and you can only choose it.

306
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:22,440
Scott: set it on a half-hour.

307
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:23,685
Scott: I wish I could.

308
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:25,513
Scott: just it's like that's confuses people.

309
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:29,690
Scott: people might come to my stream and I think okay Like I did netrunner stream on YouTube yesterday, right?

310
00:20:30,152 --> 00:20:32,120
Scott: I thought my friend might show up around 1230.

311
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:41,460
Scott: He showed up like 1130 so originally had the clock set for 1230 so people would come see it leave But then it's like oh actually we started an hour earlier.

312
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:43,448
Scott: Then I told you we were gonna start.

313
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:46,160
Scott: people showed up at 1230 and like oh it's been going for an hour already.

314
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,489
Rym: What well, that's your fault for picking a time.

315
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,353
Scott: and then what time?

316
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:51,140
Scott: I suppose they make me pick a time.

317
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:56,586
Scott: Yeah because time my supposed to fucking pick if I don't know what I'm starting because Scott as On a half-hour increment.

318
00:20:56,727 --> 00:20:57,951
Rym: remember like I said YouTube's.

319
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:02,653
Rym: the whole thing was designed around events exactly Streaming an event but that's still a problem.

320
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:03,700
Scott: That is a problem with it.

321
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,183
Scott: I should be able to set unknown time and just have it say starting soon or please wait and not actually had to pick A time.

322
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:10,759
Scott: also I have to start on a half-hour.

323
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:15,295
Scott: Professional things sometimes start at 15 minute mark 5 minute mark 10 minute mark.

324
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,443
Scott: I should be able to type in any goddamn time I want.

325
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:20,019
Rym: yeah, so that's a plus my point.

326
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,113
Rym: They will not implement changes unless they're forced to because someone else does it better.

327
00:21:25,294 --> 00:21:32,183
Rym: right because they're pretty much the go-to for that Other than in-house or white-labeled solutions, yep The other.

328
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:37,810
Scott: the other problem I have with the YouTube streaming is just the chat is not as good as like Yeah, the community stuff is just awful.

329
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,300
Scott: the chat isn't it's just a YouTube chat.

330
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:46,280
Scott: It's just this live chat that's kind of crummy and then when the thing is done It turns the chat into the YouTube into YouTube comments immediately.

331
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:49,805
Scott: But at least it saves your video as a YouTube video immediately Which is very nice.

332
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:55,200
Scott: and had YouTube bought the Google bought twitch I would have been great because we would have gotten the technologies merging.

333
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:59,034
Scott: Well, it would have been bad in terms of the competition aspect we just discussed right.

334
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:00,038
Scott: there would be only one player.

335
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:07,839
Rym: now There's still two players, but it would have been good as we saw when twitch suddenly said hey We're getting rid of all our archives.

336
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:09,687
Scott: Yeah, now are they now?

337
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:13,120
Scott: so Amazon now owns it and it sort of competes with YouTube.

338
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,751
Rym: Export these videos to now is YouTube.

339
00:22:16,831 --> 00:22:21,669
Rym: So right either have to export them to YouTube That competes with Amazon or what lose them.

340
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:28,068
Scott: Yeah, I guess what you have to do as a streamer is Usually the software that you're using to stream.

341
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:31,880
Scott: every single software that you use to stream that I know of also records locally.

342
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:42,780
Scott: so you're gonna have to basically record your streams locally and then upload them later as opposed to Let it you know, just uploading the whole thing as the stream and then dealing with it online.

343
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,700
Rym: Well, we don't know if that'll be the case or not.

344
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,320
Rym: I'm curious what Amazon will do but right now the only integration is with YouTube.

345
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:54,260
Rym: My worry is that if Amazon wants to compete hard, they'll make it difficult to get things from Twitch to YouTube.

346
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:58,360
Rym: Yeah, I don't expect to like or use Amazon stuff.

347
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:05,679
Scott: See now if I was Amazon what I would do is I would buy Vimeo and what I would do is I would leave Vimeo as is as is because you don't want to mess with that.

348
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:10,698
Scott: But I would take Vimeo's technology and set up basically a copy Vimeo on.

349
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,099
Scott: you know Cuz Amazon has Amazon web services.

350
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:19,799
Scott: They have hardware to install another Vimeo like overnight basically just and Vimeo runs on Amazon web services to begin with.

351
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,554
Scott: so Copying Vimeo and making a second Vimeo at another domain is not a problem.

352
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:37,200
Scott: getting some front-end people to retheme It is not a problem, but make it stored gaming videos only Right and basically use that to as you know to basically make it be almost like twitch has two sections.

353
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:42,100
Scott: I like the live section and the saved video on demand section, right?

354
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,699
Scott: It's like twitch just got rid of that feature.

355
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,690
Scott: But Amazon should just bring that feature back and double down on it.

356
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:47,192
Scott: and it's like.

357
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:54,926
Scott: you don't have to upload your video saved Game video to YouTube and you don't have to save it on your computer because we have this Vimeo clone We just installed.

358
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:57,139
Scott: that's gonna do it in super HD awesomeness.

359
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:58,944
Rym: Well, we'll see.

360
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:02,740
Rym: my only hope is that I want there to always be competition in this space.

361
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,890
Scott: I want there to be competition in every space all spaces.

362
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,799
Scott: Yep, but especially this one because it's the thing I use.

363
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:13,211
Rym: Yep, though I use it in a lot of different cases and ways.

364
00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:18,466
Rym: and honestly from a like watcher of things I never watch anything on Twitch.

365
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:22,476
Rym: I I just hate watching stuff on Twitch rarely watch things on.

366
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:23,720
Scott: I watch Dave Riley on Twitch.

367
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:26,147
Rym: Twitch plays Pokemon.

368
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:27,291
Scott: Yeah things like that.

369
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:32,025
Scott: I'll check out for like an hour at most total But that's about it.

370
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:35,725
Rym: So some brief news because it went on for a while about that I was does.

371
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:38,988
Rym: a huge news is a billion dollar news But it's also the kind of news that you say.

372
00:24:39,048 --> 00:24:39,731
Rym: isn't tech news?

373
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:43,328
Scott: that is business news Yeah, but there's nothing else to talk about.

374
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:43,911
Rym: Oh, no.

375
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:45,900
Rym: What about the Linux divide?

376
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,048
Rym: That doesn't.

377
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:49,554
Scott: I mean that's questionable.

378
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:57,783
Rym: whether all of you who are IT people computer science people system administrators I've noticed something.

379
00:24:57,803 --> 00:24:59,508
Rym: There's a good article that kind of explains this.

380
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:06,149
Rym: but basically the people who know Unix as opposed to Linux you mean the neckbeards?

381
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:06,690
Rym: Yeah.

382
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:10,705
Rym: Okay, or the people the Unix Santa clauses, you know I think neckbeard.

383
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,353
Scott: now guys you write for the kernel like.

384
00:25:12,393 --> 00:25:22,726
Rym: I guess that's like a Frodo like the old-school neckbeard because now the other district is more like the fedora trilby E-cigarette Rainbow Dash shirt.

385
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:23,087
Rym: Yeah.

386
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:23,950
Scott: No, not that guy.

387
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,872
Scott: He doesn't know anything about Linux.

388
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,420
Rym: Yeah, we're talking about cell Unix Santa's, right?

389
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:34,160
Rym: Yeah, the people who know I'll make it very simple the people who know how slash dev works or know what?

390
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,033
Rym: Why Etsy and var log and all those things exist?

391
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:39,760
Rym: I know a dying breed.

392
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:40,522
Scott: I'm dying.

393
00:25:40,963 --> 00:25:42,709
Rym: And meanwhile, why am I dying?

394
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,585
Rym: the people who are I guess I am done making contributions to Linux distros.

395
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:51,038
Rym: and I said what happens with Linux distros not doing that?

396
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:53,769
Rym: don't care Don't give a shit about any of that history.

397
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,435
Rym: and they keep questioning.

398
00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:56,800
Rym: Like why do we do things this way?

399
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,204
Rym: Let's just change it.

400
00:25:58,565 --> 00:26:10,425
Rym: and there's this huge growing schism between the old guard and the new guard That's causing a pretty rapid fracturing of the Linux base Like beyond the kernel.

401
00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:12,953
Scott: that's been true for as long as I've Linux.

402
00:26:13,014 --> 00:26:14,860
Rym: that has also been true as long as I've Linux.

403
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,460
Rym: But I feel like it's accelerating and I think it's actually more subtle than this article makes it out.

404
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,168
Scott: Well, I think it's a wider cultural problem just in the.

405
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:27,080
Scott: our industry to begin with is even just to say web technology, right?

406
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,227
Scott: I'm running if I set up a website today.

407
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:32,514
Scott: I'm using trustworthy shit.

408
00:26:32,554 --> 00:26:34,280
Scott: That's old and crusty.

409
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:43,720
Scott: I'll use Apache today, you know, maybe maybe I'll use nginx maybe right I'll use fucking MySQL even though people hate it.

410
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,880
Scott: I'll use postgres QL only if I have to because it's a serious application right like a bank or something.

411
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,891
Scott: Yeah, right my SQL use instead.

412
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:51,192
Scott: why?

413
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:52,560
Scott: because it's old and trustworthy.

414
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:55,871
Scott: Postgres as you all is actually new hotness compared to MySQL.

415
00:26:56,272 --> 00:27:00,170
Scott: I'm gonna run like an old Ubuntu not even the new I'll.

416
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:01,620
Scott: even Ubuntu is newish.

417
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,357
Scott: I'd rather run like a Debian or you know something that is gonna be a reliable distro.

418
00:27:06,397 --> 00:27:08,784
Scott: That's not gonna change It's just gonna get security updates.

419
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:12,073
Scott: But meanwhile you look at other people especially like in the web.

420
00:27:12,494 --> 00:27:23,480
Scott: They're running node JS Mongo DB Fancy angular all this like the hottest newest thing that's been out for five minutes and they're trusting that with their website.

421
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,900
Scott: And it's like you were just asking for your shit to go down like ten times a day, dude.

422
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:35,209
Scott: And it's I see the same thing happening, you know across the board these Linux people, you know The people who like work on the kernel.

423
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:37,240
Scott: It's like they're old Unix people.

424
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:41,500
Scott: They do it the way that they've learned that is the best way over decades and that shit doesn't break.

425
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,360
Rym: Yeah, I mean here's a quote.

426
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:51,120
Rym: This is the Unix philosophy write programs that do one thing and do it Well programs that work together programs that handle text streams because that is the universal interface.

427
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:53,269
Scott: Yes and that's what those people do and you.

428
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:57,106
Scott: the best place to see this in action is If you look at git.

429
00:27:57,447 --> 00:27:58,892
Scott: Linus Torvalds wrote git.

430
00:27:59,414 --> 00:28:02,869
Scott: it's fucking hard as balls Relatively speaking for people to use.

431
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:03,593
Scott: I mean, I know how to use.

432
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,140
Scott: it's not that hard if you try, right?

433
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,426
Scott: But it's a crusty command-line interface.

434
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:12,000
Scott: That's obviously super Unix II in every conceivable fashion and it's ridiculously powerful.

435
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:13,846
Scott: It's the whole hog metaphor.

436
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:19,282
Scott: We've talked about 10,000 times for Neal Stephenson, but look at how many people Right.

437
00:28:19,623 --> 00:28:34,641
Scott: just try to cover up git with some kind of GUI or come up with some git wrapper to do things in a Fancy friendly way and like there's tons and tons and tons of people trying to do this all over the place Just trying to cover up that Unix crust rather than learn it Right.

438
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:41,789
Scott: the last thing that it's it's easier for them to spend weeks writing a GUI than to spend a day learning a command-line program.

439
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:55,380
Rym: never mind the fact that because The interest in the like the what the way things are the way they are and why decisions were made in the old days Distros are increasingly diverging like there was a time not five or six years ago.

440
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:59,434
Rym: What if I sat down in front of Ubuntu or Gen 2 or like all these different.

441
00:28:59,494 --> 00:29:01,020
Scott: only really thing you need to new different.

442
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:07,536
Rym: Back then was the name of the package manager Yep, and maybe like they all had their different in its stuff But you know what?

443
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:15,312
Rym: Well like in red hat you could have like service space whatever and like there's distros that use that method that way to like Yeah, the other ones you just do in a D start/stop.

444
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:28,259
Rym: Yep, but then Nowadays like I've taken some new buntus and some new distros down like right at our red hat six and all these things and It's not always straightforward the right way to do things.

445
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:35,833
Rym: But while I don't know the right way that that distro expects me to do things the Etsy in it D bar log crap all still works.

446
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:36,840
Rym: just fine, of course.

447
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:41,754
Rym: But most people younger than me that I interact with in the industry.

448
00:29:42,276 --> 00:29:50,548
Rym: They know the service level only so they can either only use one distro or If the distros stuff doesn't work a hundred percent.

449
00:29:50,949 --> 00:29:53,656
Rym: They have literally no way to troubleshoot that.

450
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:54,177
Rym: Mmm.

451
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,063
Rym: I Don't.

452
00:29:56,365 --> 00:29:57,491
Rym: I mean this has been a problem.

453
00:29:57,511 --> 00:30:02,500
Scott: when people are not learning Unix skills that is not a skill that's being taught or prized.

454
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:03,244
Scott: You know.

455
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:06,080
Scott: look you can get a line node for like five line.

456
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,743
Scott: Oh, it is so cheap.

457
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:11,300
Scott: now they keep lowering the prices and making them better, but people keep setting up their websites on Heroku.

458
00:30:11,683 --> 00:30:13,960
Scott: Why why do you pay so much money for Heroku?

459
00:30:14,402 --> 00:30:18,540
Scott: Because that way you only have to learn Ruby on Rails and HTML CSS and JS.

460
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,725
Scott: You don't to learn anything else.

461
00:30:20,388 --> 00:30:25,575
Scott: and then they take care of the rest because they have Unix skills And they just charge you to borrow their Unix skills.

462
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:26,339
Scott: You don't have to learn them.

463
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:40,780
Rym: Yep, and that's what I'm seeing people It's there's no incentive as a technologist except for in a very vanishingly small number of cases to actually Understand all that Unix II crap because that's not the problem you're trying to solve.

464
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,164
Rym: That's not the thing you care about.

465
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:48,464
Rym: you want a server to run probably monolithic software on top of and On top of that.

466
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:51,775
Scott: right how many you can tell by developers who are using max?

467
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:53,320
Scott: now you meant max or Unix.

468
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:53,721
Scott: Why?

469
00:30:53,802 --> 00:31:04,546
Scott: of course Mac people be Unix II and they do use the command line and stuff on their max when they're developing But they're mostly using GUI programs, and you know what Mac Unix No matter what anyone wants to say.

470
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:09,944
Scott: you BSD people talking about how you know the OS X kernel is a real Unix or something?

471
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:13,136
Scott: the user space on OS X is fucking bullshit.

472
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:14,100
Scott: It's not real Unix.

473
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:24,659
Scott: No source code you get right for some BSD program is gonna run Just perfectly and nicely on OS X. even brew the best package manager OS X has ever had.

474
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:28,695
Scott: Every time you brew something it spits out a ton of fucking instructions about.

475
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:30,060
Scott: oh, yeah this package.

476
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,126
Scott: You're gonna do all this fucking bullshit to make this work.

477
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:39,327
Scott: You know on any Linux distro fedora devian Ubuntu arch Linux Even I use the package manner.

478
00:31:39,348 --> 00:31:40,110
Scott: install a package.

479
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,357
Scott: it fucking works immediately no questions asked.

480
00:31:42,397 --> 00:31:45,490
Scott: if I get the source code I run configure make make install it fucking works.

481
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:46,756
Scott: end of story right.

482
00:31:46,876 --> 00:31:52,358
Scott: OS X is not Unix and the people who are developing on it aren't using the Unix II part for the developing using GUI.

483
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:58,340
Scott: bullshit Right and I think the spread of OS X as the platform of choice for many developers.

484
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:01,260
Scott: I'm using Windows, but I'm using a Linux virtual machine in Windows.

485
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:06,720
Rym: Yeah Which seems to be the model everyone uses except I have one developer who actually actually uses Cygwin.

486
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:08,739
Scott: I mean I would know that's fine that works.

487
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:18,277
Scott: I would use Linux straight up If I had you know didn't wasn't using a laptop which Linux still runs poorly on.

488
00:32:18,297 --> 00:32:28,447
Scott: right but That spread of OS X has caused this lack of Unix has been Even a lack of you know just there.

489
00:32:28,868 --> 00:32:37,685
Rym: so like you just said you run Linux in a virtual machine on Windows And I'd said that most developers I know do it that way.

490
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,380
Rym: only the servers run Linux on the bare metal exactly.

491
00:32:41,243 --> 00:32:49,936
Rym: The problem is starting to also become that Unix as a philosophy Solved problems from the 80s and isn't suit like it.

492
00:32:50,438 --> 00:33:00,320
Rym: It's too Generically Big iron and it doesn't really help modern people solve the problems that modern people care about it could solve those problems.

493
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:04,593
Scott: But those crusty old guys right who your complaint?

494
00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:10,435
Scott: who are doing things the old trusty way What they need to do is they they're only interested in stuff.

495
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:16,120
Scott: They're only solving the problems They're interested in solving which are things like we got to make the kernel faster more reliable.

496
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:26,280
Scott: They need to solve the problems that normal people want solved with the correct old Crusty solution and that is the thing that can save Linux.

497
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:38,700
Scott: but it will never happen because that guy is not interested in making surround sound work perfectly on every Linux distro ever or Making 3d games run really easily and nicely from Steam or they have like no interest in doing that.

498
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:48,379
Scott: They have interested in like writing a file system to be more efficient and stuff like that Doesn't affect the end-user in any way or it does in ways that the end-user can't Understand or do it doesn't make it.

499
00:33:48,440 --> 00:34:00,958
Scott: Yeah If you look at a kernel changelog as a user of a normal computer user and you look at like the things that have changed Like the last hundred Linux kernel versions Maybe you'll find like a USB driver for something that you have in your computer and now on the

500
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:01,239
Rym: server

501
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:01,560
Scott: side.

502
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:09,053
Rym: Thank you in any way whether you use an old Linux kernel or a new one like free from recent years I mean DRBD was included as part of the Linux card.

503
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:12,512
Scott: That's your favorite and That's your favorite.

504
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:29,719
Rym: That was a great thing that solved a real problem that the users of the operating system needed solved even though arguably High level like file system replication is not something that really Deserves or is expected to be in nobody OS space.

505
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,396
Scott: Nobody who has Ubuntu on a desktop will give a shit about DRDB ever Yep.

506
00:34:34,821 --> 00:34:38,856
Rym: But increase it like Linux makes it very difficult and so does Windows like there's.

507
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:39,900
Rym: no it's not like we're saying.

508
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,784
Rym: Oh Windows is better.

509
00:34:41,065 --> 00:34:42,370
Scott: You can't develop on Windows.

510
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,719
Scott: The only reason you can develop on Windows is virtual machines.

511
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,699
Rym: You also can't run the software you make on Windows.

512
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:53,900
Scott: You theoretically can but it's even worse than OS X which is why OS X became the platform of choice.

513
00:34:54,101 --> 00:35:02,876
Rym: Windows servers are awful and usually whenever I see a Windows server in my industry It's because someone bought some software made by a company that develops solely in C sharp net.

514
00:35:02,996 --> 00:35:04,987
Scott: like if you're programming on Linux It just works.

515
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:06,903
Scott: on OS X it works But it's janky.

516
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:10,220
Scott: on Windows you put in a virtual machine because you can't make it and then it just works.

517
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:16,886
Rym: Yeah Well, it's impossible if you don't use it and then most developers have no idea to look in varlog messages to see what happened to Their system.

518
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:27,406
Rym: they don't even know Things of the day.

519
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:30,700
Rym: I have to because one of my things the day is a little bit mean-spirited.

520
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,869
Rym: So if you do not want to watch it, I have an alternative.

521
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:34,496
Rym: Mm-hmm my alternative.

522
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:35,400
Rym: I'll give that one first.

523
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:42,122
Rym: I was in a wildwood playing some ingress and It's near the end of the summer season and I had just become lovely.

524
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,508
Scott: ingress broke and I stopped.

525
00:35:43,528 --> 00:35:43,949
Scott: but I got it.

526
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,415
Scott: I got to try to mess with it.

527
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:49,630
Rym: So I had like a boatload of level 8 shit tons of it.

528
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:54,189
Rym: I used it all by capturing pretty much every goddamn portal I could find.

529
00:35:54,912 --> 00:36:02,997
Rym: Just I destroyed like so I made like 40 or 50 thousand experience points from destroying all these gigantic Fields and the portal.

530
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:04,183
Rym: I'm trying to hold on to that.

531
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:08,061
Scott: I dumped a bunch of my shit on Like logging and recharging it with the portal key all the time.

532
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:09,990
Rym: I get an alert if anyone attacks this shit.

533
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,920
Rym: Okay, is the boardwalk Loo Memorial?

534
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,124
Scott: There's a guy named Loo.

535
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:15,930
Rym: There's a guy named boardwalk Loo.

536
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:22,676
Rym: he looked I think he was a cop in Wildwood or North Wildwood and He seems interesting.

537
00:36:23,158 --> 00:36:25,546
Rym: I can't find any information about him.

538
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:29,221
Rym: There seems to be a character Named that in boardwalk Empire.

539
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:31,130
Rym: I don't think is the same person.

540
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:41,835
Rym: Okay, so this is my thing of the day because if any of you have any information on boardwalk Loo I would like to find out My mean-spirited thing of the day.

541
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:46,490
Rym: This is a compilation of people fucking up the ALS ice bucket challenge.

542
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,970
Rym: Okay, how could you fuck it up like that dropping the bucket on your friends?

543
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,175
Scott: That doesn't seem like a fuck-up.

544
00:36:52,196 --> 00:36:54,368
Scott: that seems like he purposefully fucked his friend over.

545
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:58,830
Rym: now A lot of these people just like a lot of them will be someone picks it seems like he did that to his friend on.

546
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:01,119
Scott: That is not a fuck-up.

547
00:37:01,581 --> 00:37:09,036
Rym: I've seen some where someone picks up the bucket it's heavier than they expected and they end up either dropping it on their friend or They fall over.

548
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:11,249
Rym: that lady just threw the bucket at the guy's face.

549
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:16,130
Scott: Okay, well that looked like accident, but you know, yeah people trip and fall on themselves.

550
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:18,906
Scott: This girl just dumped the ice on the floor cuz he was weak.

551
00:37:19,107 --> 00:37:21,178
Rym: Yep This guy's lifting it.

552
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,204
Rym: He's working on it.

553
00:37:22,224 --> 00:37:24,715
Scott: He's He is just weak.

554
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:26,764
Scott: Okay, that was definitely a fuck-up.

555
00:37:27,105 --> 00:37:32,080
Rym: a few people lose the tops And the best one of all these is not a fail but a win.

556
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,948
Rym: Patrick Stewart took the challenge.

557
00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:35,475
Rym: Mm-hmm You know Patrick Stewart did.

558
00:37:35,495 --> 00:37:40,320
Scott: I saw the thumbnail and he had a classy hotel ice bucket and I was like That's the kind of ice bucket you should use.

559
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,084
Scott: and I figured he just classily Dumped it on himself or put his head in it or something or you know.

560
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:48,880
Rym: like that so much class I didn't even bother watching so you should have watched it.

561
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:51,049
Rym: Do you know what the challenge actually is?

562
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:57,377
Scott: you're supposed to either a donate or Or You know dump the ice on your head.

563
00:37:57,397 --> 00:38:03,796
Rym: so he has the ice bucket he pulls money he turns down He writes and signs a check.

564
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:08,870
Rym: Yep, then he takes ice out of the ice bucket and drink some whiskey with it.

565
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:16,890
Rym: Basically the moral is if you respond to the ice bucket challenge with the ice bucket challenge, you're an asshole.

566
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:18,264
Rym: You're supposed to give money to charity.

567
00:38:18,304 --> 00:38:18,830
Rym: That's the point.

568
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:24,228
Scott: Well, and a lot of people gave money and also dumped ice but then it's not a challenge.

569
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:24,670
Rym: but no.

570
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,870
Scott: But part of the thing is that when you dump the ice, especially if you're a celebrity, right?

571
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:29,933
Scott: You're you know, there's.

572
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:33,550
Scott: there's a still some people who are living under rocks who haven't heard of it true, right?

573
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,379
Scott: And you know, this is spread around the world.

574
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:39,350
Scott: Even the kpop people have been doing this thing, right?

575
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:46,190
Scott: So if there's a fan of you who's not a fan of anything else They they just might come into their Facebook feed and they'll discover it for the first time.

576
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:54,523
Scott: So doing the challenge or at least making a video right spreads you word farther Which is why ALS is raking in a good jillion dollars.

577
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:56,010
Scott: So someone's donating what's amazing?

578
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:00,085
Rym: We're in Wildwood Emily and I and we go to this little like store to buy some stuff

579
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:01,934
Scott: and people were buying ice for the People are

580
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:03,570
Rym: talking about like, oh my god

581
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:22,528
Scott: I biked around on Saturday and I went past a park or a bunch of people were playing volleyball And off in the corner of the park someone who's had a video camera and someone else is dumping the whole Frickin You know friggin cooler full of ice onto this their friend's head after they drank all the beers.

582
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:24,333
Scott: Yeah And there you go.

583
00:39:24,915 --> 00:39:25,758
Rym: So you got a thing of the day.

584
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:29,409
Scott: Yeah, it's an annoying kpop video cuz I couldn't resist using it.

585
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:30,835
Rym: How you're using it.

586
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:31,518
Scott: I'm using it.

587
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:34,877
Rym: Oh now Prepare to have this stuck in your head for like a month.

588
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:43,770
Scott: Yeah, so orange caramel who is like a plus plus Amazingness made a new video even though they just made one like a few months ago, which is pretty awesome.

589
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,249
Scott: You don't see people like making videos constantly like that.

590
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:51,669
Scott: But the new video is also a game and also a catchy song and also a dance all at once.

591
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:53,515
Scott: Pretty epic right there.

592
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:56,748
Scott: So I just want to infect everyone with this.

593
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,063
Scott: Also, one of them did the ice bucket challenge.

594
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:00,969
Scott: the other two didn't know.

595
00:40:01,891 --> 00:40:03,799
Rym: No one's challenged us or if they have I haven't noticed.

596
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,833
Scott: I decide I'm just not gonna do anything about it unless I'm actually Challenged.

597
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:07,737
Rym: Oh, you're not gonna challenge.

598
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:10,250
Scott: It has to be from someone who was challenged down the chain.

599
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:14,890
Scott: It can't be like some spot one listener who's just like I challenged Scott, but it's like well who challenged you?

600
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,190
Rym: Yeah, you have to give us a certificate of authenticity show.

601
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:20,868
Scott: I want to see the chain going to back to like, you know some famous per.

602
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:22,738
Scott: you know I didn't start with like hockey dudes.

603
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:24,810
Scott: I think it started with like hockey dudes.

604
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:29,208
Scott: Nah, so I want to see you to show me all the way going back to the hockey people who started it.

605
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:35,970
Scott: Alright, whoever started it, you know the chain of people who requested and then if it gets to me then that was legitimate, right?

606
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,853
Scott: But if it doesn't it doesn't All right.

607
00:40:40,577 --> 00:40:42,850
Rym: in the meta moment the book of the book is still a canticle for Liebowitz.

608
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:47,650
Rym: I'm convinced that Scott will never read it before the events in canticle for Liebowitz actually take place.

609
00:40:55,276 --> 00:40:55,863
Rym: You like that one.

610
00:40:55,883 --> 00:40:56,530
Scott: that was a great one.

611
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,529
Rym: I decided to say that like over the weekend while I was driving home.

612
00:41:00,212 --> 00:41:04,730
Rym: We were driving well, we were quiet cuz I was exhausted and then suddenly I just laughed at myself.

613
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:06,358
Rym: Emily's like you just laugh and I'm like, nope.

614
00:41:07,062 --> 00:41:07,605
Scott: Well done.

615
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:10,374
Scott: Well done Golf clap.

616
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:13,350
Rym: Well, you're going to be at the motherfucking penny arcade Expo.

617
00:41:14,491 --> 00:41:14,812
Rym: That's it.

618
00:41:15,032 --> 00:41:15,594
Rym: Be the go.

619
00:41:15,614 --> 00:41:16,436
Rym: You can't get tickets.

620
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:18,543
Scott: Nothing else matters on Tuesday.

621
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,769
Scott: I can die on the plane back to New York.

622
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:23,496
Rym: We're doing a lecture.

623
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:27,312
Scott: Well, I could if there weren't another pecs in 2015.

624
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:30,465
Scott: We have the reason I'm going to stay alive the next year.

625
00:41:30,485 --> 00:41:38,750
Rym: We have put more Work into the lecture We're going to do on Monday at noon in the sandworm theater than we have ever put into one.

626
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:47,410
Rym: It is the reason I hit the brakes early on my bike And we will have an official GeekNights meetup at PAC.

627
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:57,370
Rym: So if you want to actually hang out with us, we are notoriously difficult to track down at conventions Go to any tabletop room and then if we're not there go to the other one.

628
00:41:57,412 --> 00:42:00,906
Rym: Yes But if you come at those times we might blow you off because we're probably already in.

629
00:42:00,966 --> 00:42:07,174
Scott: we're going to blow You off if I'm playing a game and I can really have time to talk to you because I'm trying to win or because we're Going to go to a restaurant.

630
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:16,760
Scott: that's way too expensive for you or even if it wasn't too expensive for you I barely know you and I just want to say hi to you and if you try to follow me to the restaurant when I've Known you for like five minutes.

631
00:42:17,022 --> 00:42:23,110
Rym: That's kind of weird However, but take note anyone who's come to a restaurant with us before had you been one of those people?

632
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,401
Rym: We would not have let you come.

633
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:30,330
Rym: so don't worry But we were doing an official meetup at one o'clock right after the panel.

634
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:40,449
Rym: Mmm, because basically that is the time we can guarantee no matter what we decide to do We have to show up to that panel or packs won't let us come back.

635
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:43,398
Rym: Yeah So we are going to be there no matter what.

636
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,585
Rym: if one of us dies the other one will be there.

637
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:48,053
Rym: if both of us die Emily will be there.

638
00:42:48,073 --> 00:42:50,600
Scott: I don't know if I died.

639
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,467
Scott: I might not be there if you die.

640
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:54,049
Rym: I'll be there.

641
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,116
Rym: I'll bring your body.

642
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:58,290
Rym: I'll roll you and be like Scott's not doing so.

643
00:42:58,873 --> 00:43:01,104
Scott: Please preserve me so I don't make a stinky for the audience.

644
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,129
Rym: You wouldn't stink right away.

645
00:43:03,355 --> 00:43:10,970
Scott: You'd be surprised Depends on what I ate How quickly it evacuates but at one o'clock outside the sandworm theater?

646
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,014
Rym: Well, you're one.

647
00:43:12,497 --> 00:43:22,086
Rym: if you want to ask us questions about the panel Well, that's probably the only time we're gonna do it because we don't take questions during the fucking panels And maybe we'll time our panel poorly and finish early and have to take questions.

648
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:22,870
Rym: that is possible.

649
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:36,023
Rym: But - that is where we will coordinate the real meetup Which is we're going to reconvene at the line to the omega-thon finale on Monday afternoon And the idea is that we will all get in that line together.

650
00:43:36,043 --> 00:43:37,790
Rym: Mm-hmm, and that's gonna be awesome.

651
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:41,602
Rym: Yeah, also if you're a pegs dev totally gonna be there come say hi.

652
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:42,464
Rym: Okay.

653
00:43:42,946 --> 00:43:45,863
Rym: You can't say anything else about pegs, dude I can say that I'm going to be there.

654
00:43:45,883 --> 00:43:47,714
Rym: Yep It's all I can say.

655
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:53,776
Scott: if you're gonna play in the netrunner tournament on Saturday come lose to me, please Please please come and play.

656
00:43:53,836 --> 00:43:56,830
Scott: play against me in my group and then lose against me on purpose so I can win.

657
00:43:57,574 --> 00:44:05,449
Scott: That is what I'm asking you All right, so when I was a kid one of the toys that I had Oh this this episode is all rims idea by the way, I got nothing.

658
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,864
Rym: Oh, yeah, my main idea was we should.

659
00:44:07,884 --> 00:44:08,890
Scott: we got no Monday ideas.

660
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,879
Scott: Please send your Monday ideas to GeekNights at front.

661
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:11,542
Scott: recruit calm.

662
00:44:11,843 --> 00:44:12,024
Rym: Yes.

663
00:44:12,064 --> 00:44:12,506
Rym: We're aware.

664
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,310
Rym: There's a forum threader.

665
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,503
Rym: You've suggested a ton of them Although they were any good.

666
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:17,410
Scott: We would have done them already.

667
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:21,450
Rym: Those are actually a lot of them great ideas, but they'd require like 20 minutes of research.

668
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:23,315
Scott: Good doesn't just mean good idea.

669
00:44:23,436 --> 00:44:24,799
Scott: It means doable idea.

670
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,722
Rym: I'll do a little meeting.

671
00:44:25,742 --> 00:44:27,948
Rym: It requires less than 10 minutes of research.

672
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:36,480
Rym: Yes So when I was a kid one of the toys I had was a cardboard box and that made me tell I had that toy.

673
00:44:36,902 --> 00:44:48,541
Rym: that box was filled with consumer and residential electronics but not electronics like Integrated circuits or devices light switches.

674
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:57,120
Rym: Yeah, I'm talking like light switch panels power outlets Screw devices screw fuses fuse boxes.

675
00:44:57,321 --> 00:45:11,269
Rym: Yep circuit breakers all the shit that I don't know how to hook up But but know how to use and basically I would spend a lot of time making elaborate Setups with that and occasionally when my parents weren't looking plug it in plugging them in.

676
00:45:11,892 --> 00:45:19,221
Rym: My goal when I was super little was to make a loop because I somehow thought that if I did that I can make an Infinite magnet and I make a magnet.

677
00:45:19,241 --> 00:45:26,870
Rym: All right, I was really upset With plugging one power outlet into another power outlet and I wanted to put a light bulb on it.

678
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,380
Rym: I thought that something awesome would happen.

679
00:45:28,702 --> 00:45:29,869
Scott: Yes, an awesome will happen.

680
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:40,304
Rym: YouTube all the views And I realized that I think I know a lot more about residential electronics than Scott does.

681
00:45:40,464 --> 00:45:44,077
Rym: or rather like electrics like electricity Hey or electric system.

682
00:45:44,097 --> 00:45:46,286
Scott: I know how to go on YouTube and do whatever it says.

683
00:45:46,306 --> 00:45:49,869
Rym: No Do you know how a two-way switch works?

684
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:57,575
Scott: You mean the kind where there's two different switches and at the top of the stairs in the bottom of the stairs We'll turn the light on or off.

685
00:45:57,595 --> 00:46:01,952
Rym: because I lived in a house once a rental house where one of those was wired up Incorrectly.

686
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:03,710
Scott: there was a time when I knew how it worked.

687
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:09,923
Scott: It's one of those things you look up and then you forget and you look up and you forget and I'm sure if I had A pencil and it could draw some lines I could figure it out again.

688
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:12,937
Scott: Yeah, but at the moment I could not instantly tell you how.

689
00:46:12,957 --> 00:46:21,850
Rym: yeah, so one thing listeners if you don't know how one of those works I have an assignment for you try to draw how it should work and then look online and then you're gonna feel really dumb.

690
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:31,596
Rym: But I was thinking about this because the other day one of the halogen lights in the ceiling of our Kitchen just fucking exploded.

691
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:33,282
Rym: really just like made it.

692
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:41,269
Rym: Oh, it made an explosion sound and There was like a flash and then a little bit of smoke and then all the lights in the kitchen went out.

693
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,557
Rym: Yep, I was like, all right circuit breaker went.

694
00:46:43,857 --> 00:46:50,106
Rym: so I hadn't actually looked in our circuit breaker panel until you know Since we moved in I kind of forgot about it.

695
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:53,885
Rym: Mm-hmm So I go over there and I open it and I was struck by a revelation.

696
00:46:53,905 --> 00:47:03,046
Rym: I have 20 amp circuits in a tiny two-bedroom apartment my panel 18.

697
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:04,510
Scott: My panel doesn't have that many circuits.

698
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:05,956
Scott: I don't know exactly how many it has.

699
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:15,950
Scott: some of them are doubled up to be 40 amps to deal with like Mine are doubled up too, but basically I have like almost a whole panel's worth for my little one bedroom.

700
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:26,510
Scott: So it's busy two rooms and a bathroom and a balcony Which is like half as many as my parents have in their house, which has two stories in a basement Yeah, and an outside in the front and the back and everything.

701
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:30,745
Rym: I mean most houses I visit attic even houses built like in the 70s and 80s.

702
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:36,209
Scott: There's just not enough holes No, and my parents house only has holes with two and not three.

703
00:47:37,815 --> 00:47:42,490
Scott: When I was there last I was like, you know Cuz we had this weird adapter and I was trying to plug in my stuff.

704
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:43,736
Scott: My stuff all needs three holes.

705
00:47:43,957 --> 00:47:47,472
Rym: really actually it's funny cuz all my stuff nowadays takes two holes Really?

706
00:47:47,713 --> 00:47:49,137
Rym: Anyway, I'll like go look laptops.

707
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:50,420
Rym: They all take two holes.

708
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:53,228
Scott: No, my actual power strip took three holes though.

709
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:54,592
Rym: Oh Right.

710
00:47:54,752 --> 00:47:59,790
Rym: I don't carry a power strip anymore because all the things I would plug into the power strip only need two holes.

711
00:48:00,031 --> 00:48:03,510
Rym: But anyway, so I need that I carry a two-hole USB power strip.

712
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:06,318
Scott: The point is and it's like you should have three holes, right?

713
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:08,485
Scott: So I went on.

714
00:48:08,505 --> 00:48:12,995
Rym: you know, why you need three holes For the third one's ground?

715
00:48:13,236 --> 00:48:13,678
Rym: why?

716
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:25,925
Scott: because it keeps you from getting shocked and go It just does Because that plug actually goes to pretty much the same place.

717
00:48:25,966 --> 00:48:26,789
Rym: that neutral goes.

718
00:48:27,331 --> 00:48:30,260
Scott: Well, usually it goes to like the actual physical ground.

719
00:48:30,802 --> 00:48:31,464
Rym: Oh, it doesn't.

720
00:48:32,046 --> 00:48:33,210
Scott: in fact depends on your how.

721
00:48:34,093 --> 00:48:41,090
Rym: When I looked on YouTube because I was looking how to change it Shows it going to like, you know, I'll stick that you stick out.

722
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:46,230
Rym: That's not how houses work anymore because you can't ground for shit with earth in most places.

723
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:49,080
Scott: Well, apparently supposedly at the box in the basement.

724
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,108
Scott: There would be a place to connect the ground, right?

725
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:58,190
Scott: Yeah, but This house the boxes in the basement were actually upgraded and so was the electricity in the house recently.

726
00:48:58,553 --> 00:49:00,170
Scott: But the wires were not upgraded.

727
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:05,810
Scott: It's just two mad old wires going through the new box in the basement to your crappy outlet upstairs.

728
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:12,016
Rym: Yeah I mean I've been in houses like as a kid or like rental houses or just like people I know that had like like.

729
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:25,410
Rym: these are houses from the turn of the century and there'd still be some like Tin or whatever wiring or like you'd see wires with the cloth insulators on them like wow That is more dangerous than just having a toaster back there.

730
00:49:25,892 --> 00:49:31,408
Scott: So what I did learn is that for building code if you put in a three-hole outlet But the third hole isn't attached properly can't do that.

731
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:32,071
Rym: shit you're.

732
00:49:32,172 --> 00:49:35,002
Scott: you're allowed to do that as long as you put a sticker next to it.

733
00:49:35,203 --> 00:49:36,849
Scott: that says no ground is bull, right.

734
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:42,820
Scott: and The other thing I learned is you know in a bathroom or a kitchen They'll be the one with the buttons around fault interrupts.

735
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,046
Scott: Yes, the ground fault interrupt.

736
00:49:44,086 --> 00:49:44,890
Scott: I learned how that works.

737
00:49:45,295 --> 00:49:46,290
Scott: Oh, it keeps your magnet.

738
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,235
Scott: Yeah it keeps you from getting killed.

739
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:55,213
Scott: but if you have a house and you want to put in a three hole and you only have Two wires and you don't have the third wire for the third hole You can.

740
00:49:55,233 --> 00:49:58,506
Scott: just you're allowed to put a ground fault interrupt there with the no ground sticker.

741
00:49:58,526 --> 00:50:01,549
Scott: Yeah, and that will actually Kind of protect you a little bit.

742
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:09,269
Rym: It'll protect you from certain say all that does is protect you from the situation where suddenly water whole shit Ton of electricity is coming out.

743
00:50:09,511 --> 00:50:10,194
Scott: It protects you.

744
00:50:10,495 --> 00:50:17,830
Scott: if you take a hairdryer and drop it in the bathtub and you have one of those Theoretically it will turn off the hairdryer pretty quickly and you probably won't die.

745
00:50:18,151 --> 00:50:22,330
Rym: However, that's a lot like those saw blades that have the skin detector.

746
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:25,139
Rym: That'll stop the blade if you shove your finger into it while it's spinning.

747
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:25,941
Scott: those work.

748
00:50:26,202 --> 00:50:27,145
Rym: Yes, those work.

749
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:28,509
Rym: Don't go test it.

750
00:50:29,852 --> 00:50:32,427
Scott: Only test it if you're the guy demoing it in the infomercial.

751
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,978
Scott: Yeah Or test it with a hot dog.

752
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:35,844
Scott: That's perfectly good.

753
00:50:36,145 --> 00:50:36,749
Rym: That is pretty good.

754
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:46,510
Rym: Yeah I've seen the hot dog test on them but when I was a kid because you know We had a lot of power tools and things the reason you need that ground plug primarily is that if the electricity?

755
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:57,210
Rym: If you short the device out without one of those what can happen is Especially in like it like an old drill or something or microphones killed people back in the days to like old shitty microphones.

756
00:50:57,672 --> 00:51:07,987
Rym: The case of the thing would become basically electrified and if you grab it the electricity would ground out through you rather than going back down to neutral.

757
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:17,782
Rym: because The only way around that is you have the polarized plug and then separately you have the ground that takes a separate path to your unified Ground in the basement somewhere.

758
00:51:17,802 --> 00:51:23,084
Rym: Yep Okay, yeah, but as a kid we had did a lot of that I was on.

759
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:24,810
Scott: the cases of things were made of plastic.

760
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:26,970
Scott: Yeah, because they just invented bakelite.

761
00:51:27,572 --> 00:51:31,449
Rym: But even then like you saw that story about the woman who was killed by her USB charger, right?

762
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,075
Scott: Was someone really killed by the?

763
00:51:33,095 --> 00:51:34,543
Rym: that's not that uncommon.

764
00:51:34,603 --> 00:51:35,387
Rym: Don't buy it.

765
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:35,870
Scott: She eat it.

766
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,014
Scott: Was it a cheap knockoff?

767
00:51:37,114 --> 00:51:37,616
Rym: one up?

768
00:51:37,716 --> 00:51:41,710
Rym: Don't buy cheap USB chargers because you plug it into the wall.

769
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:49,857
Rym: they don't have a clear like good separation or gap between the wall voltages and USB side.

770
00:51:49,918 --> 00:51:52,512
Rym: so if it's inside the circuit Yeah she was.

771
00:51:52,754 --> 00:51:53,319
Rym: she basically was.

772
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:53,722
Rym: where is he?

773
00:51:53,742 --> 00:52:00,828
Rym: at her cell phone and She was like it's listening to music and that headphones plugged into the cell phone and the USB charger shorted out and electrocuted her.

774
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:06,439
Scott: Yep when I was making my My crystal LED clock thing.

775
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:09,630
Scott: That was the number one thing it emphasized in the kit instructions.

776
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:14,410
Scott: It was like this part of the circuit board is where the voltage comes in.

777
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:17,349
Scott: Keep all the high-voltage shit on that side.

778
00:52:18,012 --> 00:52:25,738
Scott: Leave a big-ass gap between that shit and this shit on the other side after the voltage is converted so that this dangerous Explosions don't happen.

779
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:35,078
Rym: Yep, but it's interesting how nerds who are really into electronics and Circuits and soldering and all that other cool electricity stuff.

780
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,830
Rym: Usually don't know a lot about how their house is wired up.

781
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:42,334
Scott: Well, cuz that's an electrician's job As opposed.

782
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:44,782
Scott: and even at RIT there were so many different majors.

783
00:52:44,802 --> 00:52:51,503
Scott: there's computer engineering electronic engineering Micro-electronic engineering and they were all really different.

784
00:52:51,563 --> 00:52:53,790
Scott: even you know, you sure they learn a lot of the same things.

785
00:52:54,334 --> 00:52:58,160
Scott: But and there are a lot of the same classes But they were very different from each other.

786
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:11,684
Rym: but at the same time the gap between those Disciplines I think is where a lot of dangers and fatal nerd accidents happen where you know a good amount about electricity But you don't know the practical realities of.

787
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:17,752
Rym: I Guess like the way I would describe it is, you know how thin cables work, but you don't know how thick Yeah,

788
00:53:17,812 --> 00:53:33,116
Scott: someone who's a master of micro-electronic engineering it can design, you know The next Intel core quad chip and knows how to handle individual electrons and one at a time with tiny transistors Would not do well with a large Anything at the power plant.

789
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:34,540
Scott: don't let them near it.

790
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:35,182
Rym: Yep.

791
00:53:35,423 --> 00:53:36,567
Rym: Like here's a crazy example.

792
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:40,457
Rym: if you have high voltages Most people think of a switch as just a switch.

793
00:53:40,538 --> 00:53:43,267
Rym: switches are discrete no matter what on or off.

794
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:50,170
Rym: Mmm, but Ever see the switch in like a high voltage power station or like a substation.

795
00:53:50,651 --> 00:53:57,170
Rym: Those switches are like four feet wide because you need a gap wide enough to where the electricity won't just keep going across the gap.

796
00:53:57,459 --> 00:54:09,497
Rym: Yep Yep, I Just feel like more people should know about this stuff because it's really really practical to understand things Like what a ground fault does.

797
00:54:09,698 --> 00:54:13,150
Rym: or if you own a house or you look like you're a kid and you live in someone's house.

798
00:54:13,231 --> 00:54:14,587
Scott: I'm not gonna be able to own a house.

799
00:54:15,372 --> 00:54:17,541
Scott: Enough old people died that house price stresses.

800
00:54:17,561 --> 00:54:19,850
Rym: like if you're living in a shitty house that you're renting.

801
00:54:20,072 --> 00:54:23,162
Scott: I hopefully won't live in a shitty house Knowing the difference between.

802
00:54:23,223 --> 00:54:24,571
Scott: I can YouTube everything I need to know.

803
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:36,186
Rym: an annoying electrical problem and a dangerous electrical problem is probably pretty good practical advice, especially considering that people like us We I have like a hundred things plugged in in this apartment right now.

804
00:54:36,367 --> 00:54:36,930
Scott: I sure do.

805
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:47,427
Rym: It's good to at least have some idea as to how that all works and why it may not be a good idea to string Eleven power strips together to make an extension cord.

806
00:54:47,467 --> 00:54:48,030
Rym: Oh, that's a bad.

807
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:54,137
Scott: Hey, the number one thing is if I'm gonna mess with some electro electricity in the house I turn.

808
00:54:54,197 --> 00:54:58,190
Scott: I know how to turn it off and make sure I'm not Really know how to turn it off.

809
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:03,377
Scott: You go to the circuit breaker and you hit the switch and then you see if the light bulb is still on and you keep Doing that until the light bulb is on.

810
00:55:03,398 --> 00:55:05,850
Scott: the holes that you're gonna mess with is off and then you know that it's off.

811
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:11,408
Rym: Do you know the circuitized like what if there's another circuit that goes somewhere nearby and it's not connected to a light bulb?

812
00:55:11,448 --> 00:55:13,700
Rym: like the microwave Is down its own circuit and the wires are right.

813
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,390
Scott: I'm not gonna mess with the microwave.

814
00:55:15,551 --> 00:55:17,663
Scott: I'm gonna assume that I'm only if I'm gonna do.

815
00:55:17,683 --> 00:55:21,681
Scott: if I'm gonna mess with the microwave I'm gonna turn the microwave on and flick switches till the microwave turns on.

816
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:23,850
Scott: Yeah, I gotta be very specific.

817
00:55:24,394 --> 00:55:24,514
Rym: It's.

818
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:36,237
Rym: luckily the only time I ever got shocked was when Unrelatedly, I got shocked by that cage with servers in it that itself was electrified by one phase of a 220 line Mmm, I think I told that story before.

819
00:55:36,257 --> 00:55:37,863
Rym: I won't tell that story many moons.

820
00:55:38,023 --> 00:55:39,548
Rym: I've told you how many moons ago many times.

821
00:55:40,831 --> 00:55:43,525
Rym: I've told it no more than twice on the show enough time.

822
00:55:43,746 --> 00:55:47,539
Scott: It's not that bad And we're not usually tell stories a hundred times.

823
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:47,840
Scott: Yeah.

824
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:50,190
Rym: I also I don't think we've ever done a show on soldering.

825
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:52,295
Scott: What is there to say about soldering?

826
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:54,283
Scott: It's be welding for babies technique.

827
00:55:54,303 --> 00:55:55,547
Rym: Like are you good at soldering?

828
00:55:55,567 --> 00:55:59,623
Rym: I'm okay I was actually always pretty bad at it and my soldering joy.

829
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:01,510
Rym: I was okay on like board.

830
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,822
Scott: I can't make really tiny ones, but I can make really neat normal-sized one.

831
00:56:04,882 --> 00:56:12,930
Rym: Yeah, I I made a pretty Fucking inefficient power distribution bus once in middle school for a science Olympiad event.

832
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:20,933
Rym: Like it was way inefficient and poorly designed and the solder joints were to quote the guy who was mentoring me on it Dreadful.

833
00:56:21,354 --> 00:56:25,930
Scott: the main problem I have with it is that I really like the smell but it's really poisonous even if you use lead-free.

834
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:29,285
Scott: Yeah But I keep smelling it cuz it smells so good.

835
00:56:29,426 --> 00:56:38,280
Rym: yep This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

836
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,100
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

837
00:56:43,381 --> 00:56:45,368
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

838
00:56:45,388 --> 00:56:48,400
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

839
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:56,080
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.
