1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,711
Scott: When they met the Oda King, I was like, "Aw, shit!

2
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:11,334
Scott: It's the Oda

3
00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:11,555
Scott: King!".

4
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:16,499
Rym: Yeah, I think Blue Blaze is definitely, uh, I'm enjoying it.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,066
Rym: So yeah, we're back!

6
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:19,660
Rym: We're finally back!

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,478
Scott: This show exists?

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,299
Rym: Geegnights is back after a long hiatus, cause- How long is it gonna be back for?

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,359
Scott: Let's do this!

10
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:33,226
Rym: Well, I'm going to Australia in, like, a couple weeks, and then, so- So, four shows.

11
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,039
Rym: Show number one, here we go.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,000
Rym: Guys, November is when Geegnights is coming back on its completely regular, unchanging schedule for a while.

13
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:42,786
Scott: Oh, that's weird.

14
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:44,139
Scott: Geegnights' birthday is Halloween.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,242
Rym: Ah, funny about that.

16
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:51,240
Rym: Except on the actual birthday, I will literally be in Australia, where they don't celebrate Halloween.

17
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:52,939
Scott: They don't celebrate Halloween in Australia?

18
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:54,079
Rym: As far as I can tell, they don't.

19
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:54,595
Scott: What?

20
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:57,520
Rym: Uh, Scott, most of the world does not celebrate Halloween.

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,500
Scott: You need to bring Halloween to the people down under.

22
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:03,460
Rym: Yeah, well, we brought, uh, indie RPGs.

23
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,778
Scott: I'll send you some candy corn.

24
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:08,207
Rym: Scott, they're not gonna.

25
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:09,539
Rym: let me bring poison over the border.

26
00:01:12,043 --> 00:01:13,439
Scott: They let you bring Vegemite back.

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,480
Rym: Oh, someone in the forum just posted, it was, I don't know if it was Vegemite or Marmite.

28
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:22,179
Rym: They're both vile, so it doesn't matter.

29
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,520
Rym: But basically, it's like, Cheetah tries Vegemite.

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,320
Rym: And the Cheetah's, like, sitting there, and licks the Vegemite, and then it, like, rears up back and back and back.

31
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,180
Rym: It goes really fast.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,919
Rym: It's like, oh my god, like, it wants to kill you.

33
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,340
Rym: It is unhappy about that Vegemite or Marmite or Starites.

34
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,120
Scott: Mite is not for Cheetahs to eat.

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,960
Scott: You know what Cheetahs eat?

36
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:42,659
Rym: People.

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,152
Scott: Yes.

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,053
Rym: Antelopes.

39
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:44,578
Scott: Rims.

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,560
Scott: And Rims cannot run away from a Cheetah, because a Cheetah is literally the fastest.

41
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,080
Scott: It's pretty much just, like, Cheetah, and the only way to get faster than a Cheetah is jet engine.

42
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:55,779
Scott: Not even bicycle will help you.

43
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:58,580
Rym: Are there some flying things that can go faster?

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,559
Rym: I mean, a diving hawk.

45
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:03,099
Scott: Yeah, but the horizontal speed.

46
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,899
Rym: So you're focused on horizontal speed.

47
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:05,940
Rym: That's your criteria.

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,059
Scott: I mean, I can fall really fucking fast, too.

49
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:08,345
Scott: Yeah.

50
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,078
Scott: I'll just take the elevator at the Empire State Building and jump off.

51
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,920
Scott: I'll be probably going faster than a Cheetah goes sideways.

52
00:02:18,983 --> 00:02:20,117
Rym: It's good to be back doing the show.

53
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,700
Rym: So, yeah, it's anime day.

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:37,600
Rym: I kind of wish, you know, we think whenever we have a sort of hiatus like this, or a sabbatical that I go on for work, we usually build up a whole bunch of shows we can do, but we pretty much mostly built up Tuesday shows.

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,239
Scott: This is game season.

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,880
Rym: We went to a PAX, and we haven't done a lot of shows since then.

57
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,760
Rym: We've got, what, like three games we can review?

58
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:46,018
Scott: Oh, I guess so, yeah.

59
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:47,060
Rym: It says three shows right there.

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,680
Scott: Some of them are tiny games, like Sushi Go.

61
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,980
Rym: Yeah, I think we could do one show of, I almost said Euphoria, Splendor.

62
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:55,576
Rym: And Sushi Go.

63
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,440
Rym: We could do a separate.

64
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,260
Rym: I think Pen Dantay needs a whole show.

65
00:03:00,422 --> 00:03:00,859
Rym: Pen Dantay.

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,378
Rym: Spoilers, guys.

67
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,619
Rym: That's a game that's more fun than it has any.

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,918
Scott: It's going to be the joke of that episode.

69
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:11,700
Rym: Flouches are not jokes, and I have a flouche right now.

70
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,797
Scott: You do not have a flouche.

71
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:16,359
Scott: Why are you calling me right now?

72
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,719
Rym: I love how that game basically escalated to this point of everyone has a flouche every hand, no matter what.

73
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,499
Scott: Yeah, I hung up the phone.

74
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:24,217
Rym: Who was it?

75
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:25,020
Scott: My parents.

76
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:26,060
Rym: Your parents are calling.

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,680
Scott: Because you know what?

78
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,100
Scott: You know the news, right?

79
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:30,199
Scott: Tomorrow is Rosh Hashanah.

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,448
Rym: Oh, fuck yeah.

81
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:33,639
Rym: God damn it.

82
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:37,600
Rym: So yeah, that means a bunch of my development team is not going to be in.

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,640
Scott: All right, so news number one, actually tonight is Rosh Hashanah, which means by the time you hear this, it'll be Rosh Hashanah.

84
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,040
Rym: That explains why a bunch of you need notices.

85
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,500
Scott: Rosh Hashanah is not the correct way to pronounce Rosh Hashanah.

86
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:47,700
Scott: I am well aware of this.

87
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:48,040
Scott: Okay.

88
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:49,540
Scott: I'm going to tell you a story.

89
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,700
Scott: I'm going to tell you two things.

90
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,260
Scott: Number one, even if you're not Jewish, you should celebrate.

91
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:56,600
Rym: You have told this story on GeekNights before in like 2007.

92
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:56,717
Scott: Did I?

93
00:03:56,881 --> 00:03:57,334
Rym: I think so.

94
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,500
Scott: Anyway, I'll tell it again because I'm pretty sure no one who listened to GeekNights in 2007 is listening now or remembers.

95
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,679
Rym: I'm just getting this out here so the next time I repeat an old story, you can say nothing.

96
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:22,560
Scott: Anyway, so story number one, even if you're not Jewish in any way, shape, or form, if you're like some goyim from Florida, well, Florida has Jews, some goyim from Mississippi, you should celebrate Rosh Hashanah because you get to eat awesome bread dipped in honey.

97
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:28,660
Scott: Just take some apples and some honey, which you can definitely get at your grocery store no matter how un-Jewish a place you live in, right?

98
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,880
Scott: And put the apple, cut the apple up, put it in the honey, and then eat it and go, "Fuck

99
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:33,252
Scott: yeah.".

100
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:50,540
Scott: So rule number two, well, story number two, when you're in high school at the Jewish youth group, one of the advisors of the youth group, his brother or uncle or something, I think it was his uncle, came to talk to us and he was a Vietnam veteran, the kind that hadn't gone crazy but still saw real Vietnam.

101
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:52,079
Rym: He had an onion on his belt.

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,260
Scott: He didn't have an onion on his belt, he wasn't that old.

103
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,940
Scott: He was like in 50s, 60s, he was not an old person, he wasn't damaged in any way, but he saw some shit.

104
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:02,359
Scott: He saw all the shit.

105
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:11,599
Scott: And he told us a story about how he was Jew, one of the few Jews in Vietnam, and he got leave for Rosh Hashanah.

106
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:17,459
Scott: And while he was on leave, an MP stopped him and looked for, was like, "Hey, where are your papers?

107
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:18,213
Scott: Are you AWOL?

108
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:19,136
Scott: What's going on

109
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:19,279
Scott: here?".

110
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,859
Scott: He handed him the papers and the MP said, "What's this Rosh Hashanah

111
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,300
Scott: business?".

112
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,561
Rym: Because

113
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:48,318
Scott: if you're an MP who's not Jewish and knows nothing about Jewishness in Vietnam and someone has a leave paper that says, "I'm allowed to not be shooting people or getting killed right now," and it says Rosh Hashanah on it, that seems like a load of bullshit or almost so much bullshit, it couldn't possibly be fake because who would be dumb enough to write something so fake?

114
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,776
Scott: Paper.

115
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:57,559
Scott: So now, because of that story, I always say Rosh Hashanah, even though it's Rosh Hashanah.

116
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,052
Rym: Yep.

117
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,058
Rym: Well, you have a similar story about Salda.

118
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:01,887
Rym: Salda.

119
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,538
Scott: Oh yeah, the Australian guy who taught me how to Salda.

120
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,049
Rym: Yeah.

121
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:06,919
Rym: Salda on Rosh Hashanah?

122
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,360
Scott: No, that is not really a good Rosh Hashanah technique.

123
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,139
Rym: Attack on Titan?

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,478
Scott: It's Titan.

125
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:13,920
Rym: Wow.

126
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,100
Scott: Hanging out in the sun too long, getting a Titan.

127
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:26,700
Rym: So kind of an aside, but if you ever go to Turkey, one thing you might like if you're a fan of Rosh Hashanah food is Turkish breakfast.

128
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,820
Scott: What's Turkish breakfast?

129
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,617
Scott: Because we know what Australian breakfast is.

130
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:30,960
Rym: Nothing.

131
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,280
Rym: So a Turkish breakfast, a traditional one, is you just kind of say, "I would like breakfast,".

132
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:40,500
Rym: and what they do is they bring you a bunch of little plates.

133
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:42,560
Rym: They usually have like three kinds of jam.

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,706
Scott: How come the U.S.

135
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:49,751
Scott: is the only country that does the one big plate instead of... It seems like every other country on earth does a lot of little plates, except the U.S.

136
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:50,500
Scott: which does one big plate.

137
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
Rym: Because we're stupid.

138
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,578
Scott: I'd rather have a lot of different things to eat than just a whole lot of one thing.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,220
Rym: Why do you think tapas is getting...

140
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:58,440
Scott: Unless that one thing is ice cream.

141
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,900
Scott: Then bring the one big plate.

142
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:08,500
Rym: Tapas Fusion is getting increasingly popular, I think because many people are like me, and if I look at a menu, what I actually want at any restaurant is a little bit of everything.

143
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,659
Scott: Right, now here's the other thing, right?

144
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,600
Scott: If I'm at home, it's not reasonable to cook 100 different things and eat a tiny bit of each one.

145
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:18,439
Scott: So if I go to... I can easily at home cook a whole lot of one thing.

146
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:23,798
Scott: So if I go to a restaurant, I would very much like to pay money for the opposite of what I can do at home, which is...

147
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,299
Rym: Basically, you want the Lina inverse option.

148
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:25,936
Scott: Yes.

149
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:32,980
Rym: I still someday think we need to go to Salt and Fat with enough people to literally say we would like one of everything.

150
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:43,500
Scott: So Michelin just released the, not Michelin star list, I think this next week, but the like gourmand something list, which is like the almost one Michelin star list.

151
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:44,538
Rym: And yeah, the almost...

152
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,234
Scott: It has to be places that cost like $40 or less.

153
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,778
Scott: Like you can eat for real there for less than 40 bucks.

154
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,260
Scott: It can't be an expensive place.

155
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,580
Rym: Meaning these might be the highest quality to dollar ratio you can get.

156
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,140
Scott: Pretty much all the places we eat, we're on the list.

157
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,939
Scott: Salt and Fat made the list for the fourth year.

158
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,120
Scott: Alo bars on the list, like the coals on the list.

159
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:03,779
Rym: Oh my God.

160
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:09,540
Scott: All the places in New York that we eat, because we don't eat at the places that are on this list.

161
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,479
Scott: So it shows that we know where to eat.

162
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,880
Rym: The only place I've ever seen a high, like a higher average restaurant quality is Providence.

163
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,740
Rym: But that's unfair because Providence is tiny.

164
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,280
Rym: It's really easy to have all great restaurants if you only have like 15 restaurants.

165
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,517
Scott: It was just funny to see like, oh, I like the same restaurants.

166
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:28,145
Scott: these guys to job.

167
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:31,500
Scott: it is to like restaurants like, you know, I didn't even read this list before now.

168
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,500
Rym: Because Emily was like, you know, we always eat the same like five places for brunch.

169
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:39,559
Scott: Well, if you're on this list, it means they're affordable and amazing.

170
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:44,920
Scott: To get better, we would have to go to expensive and to pay less, we would get worse.

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,696
Rym: So what Emily said was we always eat at the same five places.

172
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,540
Scott: What we need to do is eat at other places on this list that we don't go to yet.

173
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,960
Rym: So she went and found a list of like the best brunches in New York City just to see like where's somewhere else we should go.

174
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,560
Rym: And you know what?

175
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,400
Scott: Half the list was places you already went.

176
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,959
Rym: Four of the places were places that we walked to almost every week.

177
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:08,460
Rym: And the only places that we haven't eaten at are in furthest Brooklyn.

178
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,519
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot of faraway places we can go to.

179
00:09:11,123 --> 00:09:11,205
Rym: Yeah.

180
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:11,759
Rym: But you know what?

181
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:15,359
Rym: Anyway, so I had some news because it's right.

182
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,639
Scott: Let's actually do news now.

183
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:16,984
Rym: All right.

184
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:17,577
Rym: Actually news.

185
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:19,285
Rym: So we can't blow our whole.

186
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:23,119
Scott: actual news is today is Wednesday, September 24th.

187
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,578
Scott: Probably way after you hear this.

188
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:30,179
Scott: Well, no way before you hear this, it will have already happened.

189
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:34,757
Scott: The return of the greatest animation on U.S.

190
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:35,380
Scott: television.

191
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,238
Rym: South Park.

192
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:46,280
Rym: I would say that Adventure Time is actually the greatest for all factors, but South Park is easily second.

193
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:47,491
Scott: I don't know.

194
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:47,816
Scott: It depends.

195
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,539
Scott: That's really close right there.

196
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:53,960
Rym: I would not say that if it weren't for the fact that it's basically a tie game.

197
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,600
Rym: Adventure Time has been going for a long goddamn time.

198
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,200
Scott: South Park has been going for even longer.

199
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,635
Scott: They both have the same thing longer.

200
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,878
Rym: Ah, but how many episodes?

201
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,620
Scott: Good question.

202
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,359
Scott: The thing is, but the episodes of South Park are full episode.

203
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,298
Rym: Well, here's what I'll say.

204
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,800
Rym: Both the shows have the quality that no other.

205
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,260
Scott: Let's not do what's better, South Park or Adventure Time.

206
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,860
Rym: No other animated show in history.

207
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,498
Scott: As a battle, no one wins.

208
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,160
Rym: It is run long enough to be past the point of like, it's good because it's novel.

209
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:27,980
Rym: And the quality average quality of episodes has only gone up as time has gone on with no deviations whatsoever.

210
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:32,440
Scott: There's a preview for tonight's new episode of South Park after this incredibly long hiatus.

211
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:42,000
Scott: And in that preview, they are taking full advantage of the fact that the Washington football team has lost his trademark and it was quite epically amazing.

212
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,359
Scott: Perfect South Park as usual.

213
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:48,360
Rym: You know, all that reminded me of is back as the student athletes.

214
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:48,878
Scott: Yeah.

215
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:53,640
Scott: I'm liking when they make episodes that say things that I already believe.

216
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:56,476
Rym: And you know what?

217
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,060
Rym: South Park is actually one of my favorite shows ever.

218
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,280
Rym: And you should all be watching it.

219
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,079
Rym: If you've never watched South Park, it's wrong with you.

220
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,651
Scott: I don't know.

221
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:06,497
Rym: Man.

222
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,460
Rym: And think about it.

223
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,780
Rym: That show started, it had like three episodes of It's Just Kids Swearing.

224
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,159
Rym: And I was already sold on that.

225
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,379
Rym: And then it got good.

226
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,979
Rym: So in very brief news, if you're a fan of Hatsune Miku, you know, there's a lot of nerdy stuff going on.

227
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,576
Scott: I'm not going to explain what that is right now.

228
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:24,180
Rym: Yeah.

229
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,618
Scott: Super art fight rejected Hatsune Miku from the wheel of death because they were like, what the fuck is that?

230
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:30,040
Scott: What?

231
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:39,559
Rym: Is this another situation like James Rolfe and his friend where it's like, wow, you are really pro in like this one arena of the world and you don't know about other parts of the world.

232
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:41,175
Scott: It's like, really guys?

233
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,806
Scott: That I think is the one thing that makes GeekNights maybe worth listening to in some far-fetched.

234
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:50,120
Scott: is that we are so great.

235
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,519
Scott: We know about so many things.

236
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,278
Scott: Aren't we great?

237
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,080
Scott: We aren't experts in just one area.

238
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,820
Scott: We know about so many geeky things.

239
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,939
Rym: You know what the listener, there is no area of geekery.

240
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,043
Scott: We know nothing about.

241
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:04,160
Rym: what the listener would say is that we are wide, but shallow.

242
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:15,940
Scott: Listen, even though we are somewhat shallow, I know less about, you know, wrestling, pro wrestling that a pro wrestling because there is a small but dedicated cadre of listener.

243
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:16,539
Scott: Anyone.

244
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:16,772
Scott: Yeah.

245
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:25,040
Scott: There are many listeners who are big into pro wrestling and I know less about it than any of them, but I know more about it than I know.

246
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,335
Scott: I'm well above average in my knowledge, despite not having watched any of it since middle school.

247
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:43,733
Scott: I've been watching bits and pieces again, just because people mostly just because I as most so much information from those people tweeting and such and also reading comic books about Andre the Giant.

248
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,378
Scott: There's like, oh, yeah, pretty good.

249
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:49,700
Rym: So, yeah, obviously, I mean, all this stuff with the comic con is happening.

250
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:56,452
Rym: So Hatsune Miku is going to be doing a concert in New York at the Hammerstein Ballroom, October 17th and 18th.

251
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,000
Scott: I guess that's because the Roseland Ballroom no longer exists.

252
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,998
Scott: You only have one option now.

253
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,389
Scott: Yeah.

254
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,480
Rym: So if you ever wanted to see one of those virtual idol, you know, watch it on YouTube.

255
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:06,858
Scott: I see no reason to actually go.

256
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,157
Rym: You can go in person if you just want to experience Sharon Apple before she turns against us.

257
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,774
Scott: I have experienced it via YouTube, but I am going to go more interesting as part of the expo.

258
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:26,439
Scott: They're having an art exhibit in New York City that I'm definitely going to go to because it'll probably just take like a half hour or whatever.

259
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,075
Rym: And that's October 9th through 19th.

260
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,537
Scott: So free entry.

261
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:37,960
Scott: Now it's called Universal Positivity, which I think is the most concise possible way to sum up what a virtual idol is all about.

262
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,438
Rym: Oh, so before when you were like, yeah, people, they didn't know how to make.

263
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:49,319
Rym: it was normally when video games come up in the course of like my discussions at these conferences or anywhere outside of like super nerdery.

264
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,640
Scott: So you're discussing nerdery at a finance place anywhere.

265
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:55,494
Rym: I will say the phrase, oh, they make visual novels?

266
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:58,644
Rym: to which the expected response is, what's a visual novel?

267
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:04,758
Rym: cuing me explaining what a visual novel is in Singapore when there was a nerd there up.

268
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,926
Rym: Everybody knew what these were.

269
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:10,040
Rym: because when I said, oh, they make visual novels.

270
00:14:10,362 --> 00:14:13,059
Rym: The response was, oh, you mean Japanese fuck games?

271
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:21,979
Rym: Yes, that is exactly why I was taking it back because I had already queued up the explanation of what a visual novel is.

272
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,979
Rym: And I'd never in my life in that context expected someone to not only know what a visual novel was, but you so succinctly define it.

273
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:32,951
Scott: That is exactly what they're 100 percent.

274
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:42,719
Rym: So anyway, things of the day.

275
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,746
Rym: So this video was.

276
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:55,259
Rym: it was one of those things where, you know, when you watch a bunch of videos of one kind, like YouTube starts to recommend videos and eventually you'll see videos popping up all the time till eventually you'll watch them.

277
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,400
Rym: So this video popped up and it looked like some sort of animation and it was pretty good.

278
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,239
Rym: The next day, our friend Judith tweeted about it.

279
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,680
Rym: So I think she was watching the same videos I was watching.

280
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,620
Rym: We both got recommended the same animation.

281
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,330
Rym: Basically, this person is making like.

282
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:12,973
Rym: it's kind of.

283
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,680
Rym: it's like a student film almost.

284
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:15,678
Rym: But I think it's just for fun.

285
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,939
Rym: And they're making an animation to a song.

286
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:20,900
Rym: And this is like the work in progress.

287
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,800
Rym: So it's half animated and half kind of sketched out and just it's super high quality.

288
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,500
Rym: And it's pretty good.

289
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,378
Rym: And you should check it out.

290
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,479
Scott: Talented person is making videos on the Internet.

291
00:15:30,622 --> 00:15:31,540
Scott: News 11.

292
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:31,606
Rym: Yep.

293
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:38,947
Rym: Both YouTube and and a person I know told me to watch this video in the span of about 20 hours.

294
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:43,340
Scott: So, oh, that definitely when you see that's the rule, right?

295
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:44,800
Scott: Something appears so often.

296
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,079
Scott: It means you got to check it out, check it out when I get home.

297
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:52,979
Rym: It's like, you know, you know how to get me to read a book, get a bunch of people I know to mention that book separately.

298
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:55,780
Scott: And then and it helps if they come from different circles.

299
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,956
Scott: Like if a person at work mentions it and then a person at home and a person in your family, it's like, oh, wow.

300
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:00,920
Rym: Yeah.

301
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:05,800
Rym: It's like when grandpa also mentions the hot today, Miku concert.

302
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,216
Scott: Yeah.

303
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:11,120
Scott: So what is my thing of the day?

304
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,507
Scott: I remember.

305
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:12,260
Rym: now you remember.

306
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,039
Scott: I do remember.

307
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,599
Scott: It is getting cold, which means it is time again for baking things.

308
00:16:19,642 --> 00:16:22,480
Scott: So I usually make tall house cookie recipe.

309
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:23,840
Scott: And you might think that's lame.

310
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:26,380
Scott: This is the most generic cookie recipe from the back of the bag.

311
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:27,239
Scott: And that is correct.

312
00:16:27,742 --> 00:16:28,418
Scott: But do you know why?

313
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:29,919
Scott: It's the most delicious cookie.

314
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:31,579
Scott: That's why it's on the back of the bag.

315
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,339
Scott: You can't do better or maybe you can.

316
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,656
Rym: Oh, what do you do?

317
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:37,145
Scott: They found.

318
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,580
Scott: I don't know if they found, but which they told house.

319
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:40,099
Scott: I don't know.

320
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,219
Scott: It was posted on the Internet.

321
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:46,840
Scott: The original tall house cookie recipe from the tall house restaurant a zillion years ago.

322
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,040
Scott: Well, not really a zillion years ago to cookies are actually more.

323
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,298
Scott: They're newer than you think.

324
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:53,419
Scott: At least chocolate chip cookies are.

325
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:56,480
Scott: So the original recipe is slightly different.

326
00:16:57,301 --> 00:17:02,357
Scott: Also, the cookies are way small, which means they're hard, not like all soft and gooey, chewy and whatnot.

327
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:09,220
Scott: So I'm going to try to make the original tall house cookie recipe as it was in the tall house restaurant.

328
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:09,940
Rym: Huh.

329
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,359
Rym: You know, if it's if it's from the era, I'm thinking, then wouldn't the recipe just be the same, but it's lard instead of butter.

330
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,259
Scott: Listen, it's not that old.

331
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,317
Scott: Tall house cookies are like it's got earlier 20th century.

332
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,339
Rym: And I'm saying look at cookbooks.

333
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,416
Rym: Lard was most cooking until about the late 70s.

334
00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:35,839
Scott: I forget the person who ran who made the desserts at the tall house restaurant, but actually tall restaurant was a way big deal.

335
00:17:36,382 --> 00:17:40,777
Scott: Like it was one of the few places that had like a separate dessert menu, like maybe even invented it.

336
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,120
Rym: Cookies have their origins in seventh century Persia.

337
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:43,595
Scott: Yes.

338
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,156
Scott: There are many.

339
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,479
Scott: There were plenty of cookies.

340
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,097
Rym: Modern cookies came to America in the 17th century.

341
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:48,760
Scott: Yes.

342
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,180
Scott: But the chocolate chip cookie specifically was an invention of the tall house restaurant.

343
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:54,940
Scott: Also, did you know a brownie is a cookie?

344
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,618
Scott: It's a bar cookie.

345
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:56,999
Rym: Uh, yeah, it's a ball.

346
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,440
Rym: I just call it a bar, but I mean, hamantashins are considered cookies.

347
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,060
Scott: Plenty of things are cookies.

348
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,440
Scott: Tall house, the chocolate chip cookie is what we're talking about.

349
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:07,520
Rym: Cookie also be a cake or a pie.

350
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,168
Rym: No, no, no, no.

351
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,155
Rym: Search for the word pie up.

352
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:14,359
Scott: Moon pie, a cookie pie.

353
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:22,513
Scott: You can make a pie out of cookies or you could even make a cake flavored cookie or a cookie cake.

354
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:23,499
Scott: ice cream cake also.

355
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:30,532
Rym: So is that an ice cream or a relation to moon pies called a scooter pie is considered a cookie.

356
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:32,860
Rym: Oh, called a malamar.

357
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:33,760
Rym: Yeah.

358
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:34,640
Rym: That's a cookie.

359
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,478
Scott: That's what that is.

360
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,053
Rym: Yeah.

361
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:38,880
Scott: They're excited.

362
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,919
Scott: I would eat malamar's every day.

363
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,078
Scott: Thankfully, they're five bucks a box, so I don't.

364
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,140
Rym: So, yeah, in the meta moment, the book club book is still mechanical for Lebowitz.

365
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,199
Rym: Did you get the spaceships?

366
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,344
Rym: I have.

367
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,680
Scott: I finished part two and I have to read spaceship part three and then I'll be done.

368
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:52,519
Rym: So no, no status update.

369
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:55,250
Rym: I'm going to read, you know, what green star is.

370
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:57,859
Scott: I'm going to read it this week.

371
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,178
Rym: Is it related to Laplace's?

372
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:05,680
Scott: We'll do the episode next week because I'll finish it this weekend because I got I have literally nothing else to do.

373
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,499
Rym: I got to read that book again because I barely remember it at this point.

374
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:10,740
Rym: So I'm reading of all things.

375
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,775
Rym: I'm not going to make the book club book because, you know, I read every book club book worthy.

376
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,617
Scott: Then why are you reading it?

377
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,300
Rym: Because I had to read a bunch of books while I was waiting for you to finish the book club.

378
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:18,616
Rym: Sure.

379
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,062
Rym: I should.

380
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,560
Rym: just every book club should be one of these.

381
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,518
Rym: I'll be so far ahead.

382
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,900
Rym: But so I'm reading our E.M.

383
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,140
Rym: Banks, one of his earliest not if not the first.

384
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:29,939
Rym: Yeah, one of his.

385
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,579
Rym: It's called the wasp factory.

386
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,258
Rym: Okay.

387
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:34,820
Rym: All I knew about this book was that it was disturbing.

388
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,539
Scott: I was told more disturbing than ultra porn.

389
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:46,200
Rym: Well, so I was told that this book was disturbing and quote, not like his other works.

390
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,678
Rym: Oh, it was in fact his first novel.

391
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:57,620
Rym: Yeah, it's basically about a kid who's a fucking serial killer and his brother, who I think is also a serial killer, and they're dead, who's oblivious.

392
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,080
Rym: And that's what I got out of the first chapter.

393
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,339
Rym: Okay, so we'll see where this goes.

394
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,855
Rym: It's just interesting that that's the first book of someone who then wrote all the culture books.

395
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:11,599
Scott: Other meta type things going to Pax Australia.

396
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,025
Rym: I will be at Pax Australia.

397
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:17,874
Rym: presenting not one, but two lectures on Sunday shows how desperate Pax Australia is.

398
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:18,380
Rym: Sunday.

399
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,099
Rym: How to win every game.

400
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:20,658
Scott: Oh, yeah.

401
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:22,180
Rym: But it'll be the solo version.

402
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:23,340
Scott: So sad.

403
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:23,880
Rym: Yeah.

404
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:26,034
Rym: And on Saturday, losing.

405
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:29,120
Rym: I just called it losing.

406
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,960
Scott: Yeah, because you had to do a second panel.

407
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:45,239
Rym: Well, it's based vaguely on a panel we did a long, long time ago called Losing Should Be Fun that we've, we ran like three times and we even ran a version of it at a like nerd night at a club in New York years ago.

408
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:48,780
Rym: But that was back before we videoed our panels.

409
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:50,698
Rym: So we have no like video of this ever.

410
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:53,420
Rym: So I'm updating the panel to modern time.

411
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,196
Scott: Too much info.

412
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:54,880
Scott: Meta moments.

413
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,580
Scott: Got to be a moment.

414
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:56,819
Scott: Not a meta month.

415
00:20:57,929 --> 00:20:58,280
Rym: All right.

416
00:20:58,629 --> 00:20:58,840
Scott: All right.

417
00:20:59,462 --> 00:21:00,277
Scott: Uh, book a book.

418
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,191
Scott: Pax.

419
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:05,680
Scott: And you should find us on the Internet because we're all over the Internet.

420
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:06,880
Scott: All the places on the Internet.

421
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,356
Scott: We are there.

422
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,660
Scott: We even have an old fashioned email newsletter that I should send out again soon.

423
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:10,813
Scott: Yes.

424
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:12,578
Scott: And figure out what to write in it.

425
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,440
Rym: Both the panels that we were responsible for at Pax Prime are on YouTube.

426
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,918
Scott: Well, you can just watch them.

427
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:20,939
Rym: That was probably the fastest turnaround ever.

428
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,659
Rym: So share that shit.

429
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,779
Rym: Less than a thousand people have watched one of them.

430
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,340
Rym: Yeah.

431
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:27,140
Scott: Okay.

432
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:27,857
Rym: Okay.

433
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:30,774
Rym: So Gundam UC.

434
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:33,040
Rym: We're a little late to the party on this one.

435
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,499
Scott: Well, okay.

436
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:35,160
Scott: So I'm intentionally late to the parties.

437
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,976
Scott: This is for those of you don't know, Gundam UC.

438
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,943
Rym: It's not ended its run in 2009.

439
00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:40,517
Scott: It's an OAV.

440
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:42,600
Rym: Oh no, that's the novel.

441
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:43,539
Rym: I'm looking at the wrong page.

442
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:43,880
Rym: Yes.

443
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,759
Rym: It ended recently.

444
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,200
Scott: Yes.

445
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,879
Scott: It's an OAV, seven episodes.

446
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,455
Scott: Each episode is like an hour ish.

447
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,120
Scott: So I didn't watch any of it until all seven episodes were done, which was quite recently.

448
00:21:55,121 --> 00:22:02,399
Scott: So I finally made it, you know, once it finished its last episode, it entered the queue and now it's sort of actually bumped up to the front of the queue.

449
00:22:03,444 --> 00:22:04,620
Scott: So now is the time to watch it.

450
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:05,780
Scott: I've only watched two episodes.

451
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,380
Rym: I've watched three and a half, so I've seen enough.

452
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,139
Rym: So we'll review this.

453
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,200
Rym: No real spoilers, obviously, but I can't spoil anything.

454
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,779
Scott: I've only seen like two episodes of it.

455
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,538
Rym: So I will say this.

456
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:17,971
Rym: This show is gun to me.

457
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,560
Scott: So that's the first, that's the thing that's constantly in my mind.

458
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,279
Rym: In fact, you know what?

459
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,660
Rym: This is the first show we have ever reviewed on GeekNights.

460
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,060
Rym: That is openly pornographic.

461
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:34,260
Rym: This is pornography for people who are really into Gundam.

462
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:38,600
Scott: That's exactly the same thing as I'm watching this.

463
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,020
Scott: I'm like, wow, this is so great because I know everything that is happening.

464
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:45,920
Scott: And I'm like, imagine if someone it's like this one scene.

465
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,380
Scott: I remember where they meet the guy who is probably char.

466
00:22:49,663 --> 00:22:50,179
Scott: Oh my God.

467
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,020
Rym: That scene where he's like, can you just take your mask off?

468
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,899
Scott: He's like, all right.

469
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,079
Rym: I don't really need your mask.

470
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,500
Rym: You have like a fucking scar or something.

471
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,078
Rym: What's the deal?

472
00:22:57,441 --> 00:23:01,719
Rym: And then the other guy in the room is like, oh, and that would be like the big moment in an old Gundam.

473
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,560
Rym: And he was like, yeah, whatever.

474
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,540
Rym: He just takes his mask off.

475
00:23:03,802 --> 00:23:05,018
Scott: He's got his mask all the time.

476
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,220
Scott: But he's like, yes, this room is a recreation of Albo accused.

477
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:15,998
Scott: And it's like, if you don't know what the fuck Albo acute is, you're probably just going to sleep right now.

478
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Scott: So that's like a five minute scene of sitting in a fancy room talking.

479
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:25,800
Rym: So it's interesting because I actually have not seen as much Gundam as you, but did you know the things that they were talking about?

480
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:27,839
Scott: Like the one year war and things like that.

481
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:32,418
Rym: I would say that I knew about half of the references in general.

482
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,459
Scott: So I'm going to spend five minutes here to give you Gundam 101 because you're going to need it to understand anything else we say.

483
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:46,093
Scott: So Gundam, you see, you see stands for universal century in Gundam, much like, say, Marvel comics.

484
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:48,460
Scott: There's a bunch of different Marvel universes, right?

485
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,820
Scott: There's the Marvel universe, which is like the one.

486
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:56,200
Scott: But then there's like ultimate Marvel and the cinematic universe for the movies take place and all these other universes.

487
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:57,480
Scott: But they're all Marvel, right?

488
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,380
Scott: So Gundam is the same way in Gundam seed and Gundam see destiny.

489
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,619
Scott: That's cosmic era.

490
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:04,320
Scott: Gundam G Gundam.

491
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:05,218
Scott: Some bullshit.

492
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:06,780
Scott: Yeah, Gundam wing.

493
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,360
Scott: That's some other bullshit, right?

494
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,780
Scott: Main Gundam.

495
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,200
Scott: The Gundam that counts is universal century.

496
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:19,638
Scott: So what universal century is, is basically right now in the real human world, we had BC, then we had AD.

497
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,818
Scott: I know Domini.

498
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,582
Scott: Then they have.

499
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:25,980
Scott: you see the entire Earth has one government and we have colonies in space.

500
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,580
Scott: It's a new era of humanity.

501
00:24:27,722 --> 00:24:28,819
Scott: It's now you see one.

502
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:34,116
Scott: So the first Gundam Mobile Suit Gundam takes place in 78 universal centuries.

503
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,544
Scott: Year 78, the 78th year after you see one.

504
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:50,820
Scott: So Gundam, you see Gundam Unicorn takes place, I think, in like 90 something or maybe 80 something.

505
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,852
Rym: It's basically it's just on the cusp of 100 years after you.

506
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,980
Scott: It's two or three years after as fake char comments on constantly.

507
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,500
Scott: Yes.

508
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:13,300
Scott: So basically the quote end up until the release of Gundam Unicorn, the quote unquote end of UC Gundam as a property was Charles Counterattack.

509
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,580
Scott: So this is two or three years after Charles Counterattack.

510
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:25,542
Scott: Interestingly enough, relating to an old GeekNights episode, this is decades before Gundam F 91.

511
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:25,885
Rym: Oh, oh, yes.

512
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,139
Rym: That actually makes some things make more sense.

513
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:37,039
Scott: Gundam F 91 takes place decades after Gundam Unicorn, decades after humans expressed any form of emotion.

514
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:45,920
Scott: Yes, but so effectively effectively Gundam Unicorn is like aftermath of it's a couple of years after Charles Counterattack.

515
00:25:46,222 --> 00:25:49,200
Scott: What's going on in Gundam land for all you Gundam nerds?

516
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:55,900
Scott: We're going to spend half the time talking about the history of Gundam, not actually talking about it, though, referring to it, expecting you to already know it.

517
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:56,683
Rym: All this does.

518
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:04,820
Rym: the thing is it doesn't refer to this stuff in any way that is relevant to what is actually going on, except perhaps as allegory.

519
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,040
Scott: That's the thing is it's Gundam Unicorn is not about the events of Gundam Unicorn.

520
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:17,439
Scott: It's about these events only have meaning in relation to the things that happened in quote real Gundam.

521
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:18,380
Scott: Right.

522
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:29,338
Scott: Which is Gundam and Zeta Gundam and Charles Counterattack, though I would argue that you can only care about these things in their relation to those other things because you care about the past and you.

523
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,245
Scott: And this is it's like.

524
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,760
Scott: I don't care about who's this kid is the main character.

525
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:34,547
Rym: And we'll get.

526
00:26:34,587 --> 00:26:35,779
Rym: we'll get to Belanges.

527
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,979
Scott: Yeah, I don't give a fuck about Belanges.

528
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:39,200
Scott: Right.

529
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:52,220
Scott: But I do give a fuck about, you know, like our white base and bright Noah and Char and Amaro, who's probably dead, you know, at the end of Charles Counterattack, him and Amaro are effectively dead.

530
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:53,220
Scott: As far as you can tell.

531
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,560
Scott: Well, so yeah.

532
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,540
Rym: Well, well, notice his evasive answer of are you Char?

533
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,680
Rym: And he's like, it doesn't matter if I'm Char.

534
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,359
Scott: But then notice earlier, he's like, aha, my opponent is the Gundam again.

535
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:06,158
Rym: Yeah.

536
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,300
Scott: Oh, Gundam, you are still my opponent.

537
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:14,218
Rym: Several of the references do not actually relate in a meaningful way to what's going on now.

538
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:27,558
Rym: It'd be like if I said proper nouns from World War One periodically in conversations during World War Two, but didn't refer to them in context or relation to what was happening now.

539
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:28,739
Rym: But I referred to them.

540
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,159
Rym: So the nerd would go, oh, my God, he's talking about.

541
00:27:31,682 --> 00:27:31,897
Scott: All right.

542
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,380
Scott: So let's actually talk about Gun Unicorn.

543
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:36,158
Rym: So this show is breathtaking.

544
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,500
Rym: The animation is amazing.

545
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:40,960
Scott: So I'm watching this in my surround sound.

546
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:47,940
Scott: And just like when the Gundam just flies by or any mobile suit flies by, it's like you're watching Star Wars in a fucking movie theater.

547
00:27:48,462 --> 00:27:52,500
Scott: And that's the thing, because it's an OAV where you're watching a TV Gundam.

548
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,017
Scott: It's like, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

549
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,500
Scott: And when you watch this, it's like, oh, no.

550
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,300
Rym: When they the first Itano circus that happens pretty early on.

551
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,600
Scott: Well, when he went, oh, episode two, where he brings out the gun.

552
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:06,160
Scott: Yeah.

553
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:09,200
Scott: And the gun grazes the one dude's mobile suit and just explodes.

554
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:09,719
Rym: Yeah.

555
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,219
Scott: Like the way they animate the gun firing and the sound is that you just feel how ridiculously strong the rifle, the U.C.

556
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,439
Rym: gun, the unicorn gun, because it makes that noise like.

557
00:28:20,662 --> 00:28:23,677
Scott: And then like you see the huge everyone else is like, pew, pew, pew, pew.

558
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:30,300
Rym: Granted, he used a lot of that ammo and he's the only he had two more packs on the back.

559
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:30,658
Scott: Yes.

560
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:35,180
Rym: But he's the only one with that special magic Gundam that they stole.

561
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:38,119
Rym: So how the fuck is he going to rearm that thing?

562
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:39,820
Scott: That's a good question.

563
00:28:39,903 --> 00:28:40,098
Rym: Yeah.

564
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:40,792
Rym: You know what?

565
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,740
Rym: That's starting to bother me a lot already.

566
00:28:44,204 --> 00:28:46,140
Scott: That didn't bother me right away.

567
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,839
Rym: But well, here's why it bothers me.

568
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:57,339
Scott: So before I get into the not the negatives, but that he flew it from the one from the place to the other place, he didn't bring any equipment with him.

569
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:57,613
Scott: Yeah.

570
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,319
Rym: So how did they get it?

571
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,020
Scott: Where did where did that federation ship get that equipment?

572
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:09,259
Rym: If there is not either another person who you unlike another Gundam that uses that gun because they just have ammo for it.

573
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:10,138
Scott: How did it get there?

574
00:29:10,703 --> 00:29:12,291
Rym: Yeah, like or like it might.

575
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:13,598
Rym: maybe that's just a common gun.

576
00:29:14,965 --> 00:29:15,679
Scott: It's just powerful.

577
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,199
Rym: So it's a special gun and they don't make an issue of his ammo.

578
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,939
Rym: I'm really disappointed in this.

579
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,280
Scott: Gundam is usually, you know, for being fictional.

580
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:25,280
Scott: Right.

581
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,479
Scott: In terms of its science, not being hard sci fi.

582
00:29:27,963 --> 00:29:29,580
Scott: It's always incredibly consistent.

583
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,346
Rym: Yeah, that is.

584
00:29:30,427 --> 00:29:31,418
Rym: that's what's bothering me.

585
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,424
Rym: Think about.

586
00:29:32,444 --> 00:29:36,420
Scott: you might like the first question you might have if you were one of those people who's like, well, why are they doing this?

587
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:37,179
Scott: It makes no sense.

588
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:38,839
Scott: You're like a military fan boy.

589
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:39,880
Scott: You're watching Gundam.

590
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:42,640
Scott: The first question you're going to ask is they're in outer space.

591
00:29:42,904 --> 00:29:43,900
Scott: They have like capital ships.

592
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,400
Scott: They can just fire ridiculous weapons.

593
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:46,820
Scott: Why would you fly around?

594
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:50,900
Scott: Why is it a good idea to fly around in a robot with arms and legs and guns?

595
00:29:51,162 --> 00:29:53,460
Scott: That makes no military strategic sense whatsoever.

596
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:54,019
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:55,079
Scott: And they explain it.

598
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:58,120
Scott: That's why they're always talking about fucking Manovski particles.

599
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,352
Scott: Manovski particles are basically the made up science.

600
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:15,340
Scott: excuse for why the people are fighting war using Gundam mobile suit technology is that basically they found discovered Manovski particles and they fuck up all radio communications and targeting systems.

601
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,740
Scott: So basically all those technologies are useless.

602
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:23,860
Scott: So what happens is when ships enter a battle, they just fucking fill the battlefield with nasty particles like crazy.

603
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:31,440
Scott: So no one else can use like a targeting system and just blow their brains out immediately with one shot, like, say, Star Trek, dumb ass battles.

604
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:40,220
Scott: So you're pretty much forced to go into the battlefield with humans and incredibly maneuverable occasionally a hyper mega particle cannons, right?

605
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,820
Scott: It's like the only thing you can do, the most effective weapon in a battlefield is covered in these things is a Gundam.

606
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,980
Scott: It's like for every kind of military fanboy question like that, they have an answer.

607
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:53,779
Scott: If they fuck up something like, where did he get this gun from?

608
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:55,300
Scott: That's pretty sad.

609
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,779
Rym: Well, that's it.

610
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:11,780
Rym: Because one thing I noticed to compare this to a different Gundam, like Gundam seed, Gundam seed, while it was a little more pulpy and less Gundam-y, the one thing it did is that it really paid attention to bridge discipline and like sequence of events in battles.

611
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,140
Scott: Well, I think the captain of the ship in Gundam Unicorn is sort of derpy.

612
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:16,640
Rym: But all the ships are like that.

613
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,400
Scott: You'll notice that like basically that Lieutenant guy is really getting it done.

614
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:23,730
Rym: Scott, how many times do the kids get away?

615
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:33,360
Rym: or the kid just like runs over and pilots the Gundam on his own and every other Gundam, if a kid runs over and tries to pilot a Gundam, there's the long drawn out drama scene where he's like, you've got to launch me.

616
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,340
Rym: And they're like, no, we're not going to launch your security procedure or whatever.

617
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,820
Rym: And they just like look and they're like, oh my God, he's in the Gundam.

618
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:41,118
Rym: How did that happen?

619
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:50,920
Rym: Like the bridge discipline is non-existent and the show will pause the action to have lengthy dialogues far beyond what other Gundams did.

620
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:58,539
Scott: Well, I think also more so than other Gundams, the Unicorn Gundam itself is more magical than other Gundams are.

621
00:31:58,811 --> 00:31:58,940
Rym: Yeah.

622
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,619
Rym: Why is it better?

623
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,959
Rym: Because of love and psychics.

624
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,799
Rym: And I guess it's programmed new types.

625
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,659
Scott: It's new type power.

626
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,880
Rym: It's programmed to kill new types because it was made by the Federation.

627
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:09,479
Scott: It's like the special mode is called NTD.

628
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:13,920
Scott: That definitely stands for like new type destroyer detected or something like that.

629
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,860
Scott: It detects new type something.

630
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,719
Rym: Well, it detects a new type and then it only goes into hyper mega fuck you up mode if it's fighting a new type because it's designed to genocide the new types.

631
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:24,497
Scott: Is it?

632
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:25,519
Rym: Maybe.

633
00:32:26,002 --> 00:32:29,400
Rym: But then they argue that that's just a cover and there's a better program under there.

634
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,240
Rym: You know, Laplace's box or whatever, that crab.

635
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:36,520
Scott: So that's the main plot is that there's a thing called Laplace's box.

636
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,659
Rym: But no one knows what it is.

637
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:43,340
Scott: No one knows what it is, but the Unicorn Gundam is the key supposedly, but they don't know what it is or how to open it.

638
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,460
Rym: All they know is that it can literally destroy the Federation government.

639
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,780
Scott: Which would be very happy for the Xayah, the Xion people.

640
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:52,033
Rym: Xayah.

641
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,939
Rym: Your slip up there covered one of the things I was going to bring up.

642
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,920
Scott: The space people would be very happy if they got Laplace's box and destroyed the Federation.

643
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,939
Scott: The Earth people would not be so happy.

644
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,920
Rym: Yeah, the Earth be in every Gundam though.

645
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,340
Rym: If you have to pick a side, I mean, the Earth people are usually the better guys.

646
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,724
Scott: Well, that's so.

647
00:33:12,965 --> 00:33:18,780
Scott: usually the way a Gundam plays out is it's that you've unified the Earth, but now there are people in space and the space people are upset.

648
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,798
Rym: The space anoids.

649
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:24,780
Scott: Right, because why are Earth people have any say over what happens in space?

650
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,120
Scott: They don't know what it's like out in space where our lives are completely different from theirs.

651
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,500
Scott: They're all sitting on their Earth and we're all sitting here in our space stations, right?

652
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,260
Scott: So the space though, it's like, we don't want Earth ruling us.

653
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,900
Scott: You want to rule ourselves, right?

654
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,478
Scott: We don't, you know.

655
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,438
Rym: And then Earth's like, no.

656
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,860
Rym: And they usually commit some atrocity or hold it back.

657
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,777
Scott: Usually the good guys are fighting on the Earth side, right?

658
00:33:45,663 --> 00:33:46,217
Scott: In a ship.

659
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,500
Scott: And you know, the bad guys are fighting on the Xeon side in space.

660
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:58,380
Rym: But well, because the bad guys, the people would be good guys, but really, then they commit some crazy terrorist act that starts a season.

661
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,480
Scott: But there is never any like clear line between good guys and bad guys.

662
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,420
Scott: The guys in charge of the Federation are evil.

663
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:13,060
Scott: The people in charge of Xeon, the original people in charge of Xeon were good, but now the Zabi family runs the show and then that becomes evil.

664
00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:14,859
Scott: Yeah, that's like the beginning of God.

665
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:16,380
Rym: Now we got the princess of Zabi.

666
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:18,360
Scott: Char is completely evil.

667
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,900
Scott: He's sort of like a Magneto kind of character where, you know.

668
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:22,757
Rym: Yes, Magneto.

669
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:23,658
Rym: I am not evil.

670
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,280
Rym: Come join the brotherhood of evil.

671
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:27,040
Scott: Yeah.

672
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,219
Scott: He's sort of that kind of guy where it's like, he means well and his method is bad, which is usually killing people.

673
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:32,802
Scott: And

674
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:40,873
Rym: yeah, but at the same time, like in different Gundams or throughout history, a lot of times like, wow, the new types commit some horrible atrocity,

675
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:48,139
Scott: but like destroying a whole, because yeah, they basically use terrorism because they don't have the giant army that, you know, the Federation has.

676
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:55,440
Scott: So they'll be like, well, we're going to do a colony drop and drop an empty colony on the earth or we're going to destroy a whole space colony.

677
00:34:56,023 --> 00:34:57,540
Scott: Boom terrorism.

678
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:00,199
Scott: So, and that's why they're the bad guys.

679
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:08,350
Rym: This is gundam porn, but it's gundam porn in the sense that the visuals are everything everyone ever wanted out of anything they would see.

680
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:15,620
Rym: with gundam and the proper nouns Come like a machine gun, blah, blah, blah.

681
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,300
Rym: Full of frontal Laplace's frontal red comet.

682
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:33,140
Scott: So I think it's, it's really good, but I'm a person who knows gundam and has seen all of original gundam and all of Zeta gundam and is reading the gundam origin manga and is built more than one gundam and knows a lot about gundam.

683
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,958
Rym: So I have never seen Zeta gundam.

684
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:39,300
Rym: That's like, that's pretty much the biggest hole in my gundaming.

685
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:40,800
Scott: Zeta gundam is pretty important.

686
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:41,595
Rym: Yeah, I know.

687
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,720
Rym: Did you still have those bullshit broken subtitle DVD pack or whatever?

688
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,320
Scott: Yeah, I have that.

689
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,359
Rym: Yeah, I should just watch the gundam, I think.

690
00:35:50,162 --> 00:35:51,159
Scott: So people don't know this.

691
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,320
Scott: There's an official gundam YouTube channel.

692
00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:03,880
Scott: You can watch many, if not most gundams on this YouTube channel in many languages for free legally, including gundam build fighters, which is in my queue.

693
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:09,040
Rym: So let's talk about the show specifically for getting the proper noun porn.

694
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:13,779
Rym: And even if you don't know what those proper nouns are, we might end up using some of it.

695
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:17,020
Rym: It's fine because it works out kind of like the prince of nothing.

696
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,820
Rym: How in the beginning there's all these proper nouns.

697
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:25,840
Rym: From pretty sure you can gloss over all of them and they just sound like historical.

698
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,660
Scott: Yeah, you can follow the show, but I think you'll lose some of the, not having seen any gundam.

699
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,119
Rym: You won't get why everyone flips out when they figure out who Audrey Byrne is.

700
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:44,040
Scott: You won't have like an emotional response to the things that they say, but you'll be able to follow the plot of this story easily.

701
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,880
Scott: You just won't like have any sort of feeling that you're supposed to have when someone's like, Oh, red comet.

702
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,549
Rym: Yeah.

703
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,940
Rym: Except my problem is that the characters in this show, their emotional reactions to things make zero sense.

704
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:02,080
Rym: And it's like people just react to things randomly.

705
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:07,596
Rym: Like suddenly people will react to something very strongly in a way that doesn't make any sense.

706
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,800
Scott: That is pretty much every gundam, but yeah, more so in this one than others.

707
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,228
Rym: Like watch, you know, another, another non.

708
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:20,440
Rym: like proper gundam and gundam seed characters, emotional reactions to things made sense.

709
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:27,579
Rym: People would escalate into like emotional outbursts or escalator deescalate to or from every episode, losing it a little bit more.

710
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:28,059
Rym: Yup.

711
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,460
Rym: But in this one, like in the beginning, a kid is already like acting kind of weird.

712
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,239
Rym: The main character, bland cheese.

713
00:37:35,862 --> 00:37:38,920
Rym: And then he inexplicably sees video girl.

714
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:40,619
Rym: I falling out of the sky.

715
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:42,700
Scott: Uh, well it's not video girl.

716
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:43,233
Scott: Hi.

717
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,740
Scott: It's uh, it's lock is Klein.

718
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,760
Scott: At least as far as you're concerned, it's Lala soon.

719
00:37:50,041 --> 00:38:01,179
Rym: So he sees her and rushes to save her and then skips all of the emotional attachment and immediately has a scene where he says, don't go.

720
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,879
Rym: What do I have to do to make you need me?

721
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,258
Rym: I'm obsessed with you.

722
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,079
Scott: It's the connection between new types.

723
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:07,670
Rym: Yeah.

724
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,555
Scott: They're new types.

725
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,000
Scott: They feel a connection to each other.

726
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:18,780
Rym: But the way it's handled in the show, like if you, if you know gundam, you obviously know that he's a new type and she's a new type and like this stuff.

727
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,639
Scott: And you know who she is even before they reveal it.

728
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:31,319
Rym: But if you don't know all that stuff, and even if you do the way they handle it, the characters reactions just, it's like he dials the volume up to 11 suddenly in the middle of a sentence.

729
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:31,796
Scott: That is true.

730
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,879
Rym: And the whole show is like that.

731
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:48,797
Rym: It's like the people watching who know gundam and the people who are making the dialogue and like the character stuff in the show, they're just kind of skipping all the beats in conversation to get to the emotional high point immediately as they can move on to the next scene.

732
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,958
Scott: Well, I only have seven episodes.

733
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:50,660
Rym: Exactly.

734
00:38:51,202 --> 00:38:57,420
Rym: So as a result, like characters reactions on a human level just make no goddamn sense.

735
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:13,000
Rym: Like people will react in a deadpan fashion to things that should be big revelations and people will react with yelling and soliloquy about what does it mean to be at war and what is the root of all violence to completely innocuous statements by people around them.

736
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,817
Scott: They also use tons of it.

737
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:25,657
Scott: They're basically using every shortcut in the book to like get characters in there and get you to know them and maybe supposed to care about them while giving them the minimum amount of screen time.

738
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:32,140
Rym: So you've got the guy who's basically the special forces guys, the big mohawk guy.

739
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:32,780
Scott: Okay.

740
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:34,880
Scott: No, but I mean, you got the guy who's basically mula flaga.

741
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:35,500
Scott: Right.

742
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,625
Scott: So it's like they show a guy.

743
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:45,620
Scott: he's got a mobile suit and he has a little tiny biplane charm that they focus on every time on screen.

744
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:50,500
Scott: It's like, oh, he's the ace pilot character who's basically taking that slot right there.

745
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,036
Scott: That's the guy.

746
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:51,596
Scott: That's him.

747
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,478
Rym: Well, we know what his fate is going to be.

748
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,660
Scott: And it's like, oh, he, you know, he fights in space and he's clearly not at the bad ass new type level, but he's the top of the human level.

749
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,518
Scott: There he is.

750
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,027
Scott: He's the guy like.

751
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:04,400
Scott: they communicate all that in a matter of seconds.

752
00:40:04,943 --> 00:40:06,259
Scott: And now they basically don't need to.

753
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:09,000
Scott: They only only need to bring him out when they want to use him.

754
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,163
Scott: They don't have to actually bring him out to develop him because they only communicate that to you.

755
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:17,480
Rym: if you've seen other Gundam, I suppose.

756
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:26,260
Rym: Otherwise, as I think a person who had seen no Gundam before would just wonder why they keep showing this guy, because it doesn't seem like he's doing anything.

757
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,740
Scott: Yeah, he really hasn't done anything other than fight in space a little bit.

758
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,440
Rym: He reacted to the unicorn Gundam just going apeshit on everybody.

759
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,044
Scott: Well, that's the other thing.

760
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:37,500
Scott: is people like it's Gundam, right?

761
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,659
Rym: Well, because the whole like Gundam, like that special program had all been shut down because of past drama.

762
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,060
Scott: Right.

763
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,320
Scott: So it's like even in the scene where people are like, Oh my God, it's Gundam.

764
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,259
Scott: I was like, what does it mean?

765
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:51,200
Scott: What's the difference between a Gundam and another mobile suit?

766
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,097
Scott: Now that's how do they know just by looking at it that that one's Gundam and the other ones are.

767
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,768
Rym: I think the show does that part?

768
00:40:57,808 --> 00:41:00,520
Rym: well, actually, because if you've never seen Gundam, they're like Gundam.

769
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,699
Rym: You're like, why is everyone flipping out?

770
00:41:02,103 --> 00:41:03,380
Rym: And then the Gundam starts fighting.

771
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:08,100
Rym: And the kid who knows nothing about fighting basically wrecks the entire battlefield.

772
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:08,560
Scott: No, no, no.

773
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,380
Scott: But how do the people?

774
00:41:09,643 --> 00:41:10,900
Scott: So you see this.

775
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:16,880
Scott: It's an awesome robot, but they knew even before it started fighting, they just saw it and they're like, it's Gundam.

776
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:18,519
Scott: How do they know?

777
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,239
Scott: And the reason that they know is because the horns split in half and made the two little yellow things.

778
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:27,500
Scott: And that's how, you know, and the face, you know, when it transforms, the face changes.

779
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,420
Rym: I like how the face change into gun so dumb into Gundam shape.

780
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:32,110
Scott: And it's like, that's how they know.

781
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,720
Scott: it's Gundam because the Gundams have.

782
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,718
Scott: That is what a Gundam's head looks like.

783
00:41:36,265 --> 00:41:37,359
Scott: But you don't.

784
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:45,140
Scott: I mean, if you're just a person who's never seen a robot show before, you don't know that that's what makes that one a Gundam and the other ones just mobile suits.

785
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:53,179
Rym: They've also, there are scenes you haven't gotten this far yet, but there's scenes where new types interact with each other.

786
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,635
Rym: And that shit is pulled off like the last episodes of Gundam seed in the earliest episodes of this.

787
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:07,300
Rym: Like five minutes of the naked characters having their psychic flashback conversation.

788
00:42:07,946 --> 00:42:08,060
Scott: Yep.

789
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,620
Scott: They're not having no delay in the new type action here.

790
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,479
Scott: I mean, and it's weird because they're basically just reusing the same things from the original Gundam.

791
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:22,380
Scott: We're like, you know, Char and Omro would be like, he's Char is nearby.

792
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:23,076
Scott: He is.

793
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:24,580
Scott: Yeah, I can tell.

794
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,060
Rym: But they do basically everyone thing.

795
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,940
Scott: Like everyone does a girl falling outside.

796
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:28,518
Scott: I can tell.

797
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:29,499
Scott: I'm gonna go rescue her.

798
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:29,820
Scott: What?

799
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:30,363
Scott: How did?

800
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:32,940
Rym: every episode has ding, ding, ding.

801
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,160
Rym: It's like they're just, I am in each other.

802
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,078
Rym: It's pretty funny actually.

803
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:35,680
Scott: Yeah.

804
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:37,480
Scott: It's like they just come out right.

805
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,660
Scott: They come out with it right away.

806
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,640
Scott: There's no hesitation.

807
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,180
Scott: Just reusing all their old tropes hardcore.

808
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,459
Rym: So in the second episode, I think it was the first episode, right as he meets Audrey Hepburn.

809
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:51,309
Rym: Did you notice the two movie posters that were like up in the?

810
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:56,320
Rym: yes, I noticed the juxtaposition of those two was on subtle.

811
00:42:57,322 --> 00:42:59,099
Scott: It's not really much subtle in the show at all.

812
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,396
Scott: Yeah.

813
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,840
Scott: Except for the, you know, the terrible secret of space isn't subtle.

814
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,438
Scott: It's just hidden.

815
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:09,240
Rym: It's hidden in a stupid, Laplace's box was full of love all along.

816
00:43:09,722 --> 00:43:10,500
Rym: Oh, and a Gundam.

817
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:15,579
Scott: Like the secret is, oh, he doesn't realize he's a murderer.

818
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,240
Rym: You know what they're going to find in there?

819
00:43:17,341 --> 00:43:17,992
Rym: The end jammer.

820
00:43:19,483 --> 00:43:21,299
Scott: Uh, that's a different, I know, I know.

821
00:43:25,123 --> 00:43:27,160
Scott: Oh, what can I say about this show?

822
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,740
Scott: It's not much.

823
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,959
Scott: I think if you're a Gundam fan and you know, Gundam, you should watch this because it's pretty kind of epic.

824
00:43:33,622 --> 00:43:36,899
Scott: If you don't know, Gundam, you probably shouldn't watch this.

825
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:38,940
Scott: You should watch some other Gundams.

826
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,919
Scott: And if you become into Gundam, then you'll eventually get to this.

827
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:43,918
Rym: Yeah.

828
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:54,340
Scott: But if you've already known all the gun and you know what I'm going to say, this people are always there making suggestions, like what Gundam you should read first or watch first or whatever.

829
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:54,591
Scott: Right.

830
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:56,699
Scott: And people would say, oh, watch.

831
00:43:57,983 --> 00:43:59,280
Scott: I'm still a little tiny bit sick.

832
00:43:59,360 --> 00:43:59,718
Rym: Little Flemmy.

833
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,037
Scott: Yeah.

834
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,840
Scott: They'll be like, watch the compilation movies of the first Gundam.

835
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:04,399
Scott: And it's like, all right, that's all right.

836
00:44:04,784 --> 00:44:05,740
Scott: It's not a bad choice.

837
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:05,970
Scott: Yeah.

838
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,100
Scott: Watching actually the first Gundam.

839
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,200
Scott: That's basically the same thing, but takes a little longer.

840
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,220
Scott: Gundam seed.

841
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,259
Scott: Definitely watchable.

842
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:13,720
Scott: If you've never seen any Gundams before.

843
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:21,120
Scott: Well, cause Gundam seed at least, even though that's not universal century, it's basically the same story as the first Gundam, just different characters and different robots.

844
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:33,060
Scott: Um, but I'm going to say now available in English, uh, not completely in its entirety, but much of it, Gundam, the origin, the manga from vertical.

845
00:44:33,843 --> 00:44:35,360
Rym: Oh, you were talking about that before.

846
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,000
Scott: It's basically among it's weird.

847
00:44:38,241 --> 00:44:46,020
Scott: Usually when, you know, a manga is turned into an anime or vice versa at best, you get a faithful adaptation that is not really necessary.

848
00:44:47,222 --> 00:44:55,907
Scott: I would say Gundam, the origin, the manga is, it's basically the same story as the original Gundam 78.

849
00:44:55,907 --> 00:44:56,699
Scott: I think it's just better.

850
00:44:57,181 --> 00:45:02,800
Scott: It's the same story, only better with more stuff and you, you can read it slowly and you won't miss anything.

851
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:06,019
Scott: And it doesn't really differ from it.

852
00:45:06,602 --> 00:45:12,820
Scott: It just adds more like in the gaps, like things that were possibly even just cut out of the original or things.

853
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:22,519
Scott: I mean, there's tiny, tiny details that were changed in the plot, but they don't really matter because the novels and the anime are already different from each other in those slight kind of ways.

854
00:45:23,001 --> 00:45:30,059
Scott: So it's almost like it's sort of just compromises between the novels and the anime in some parts, but, uh, just read that.

855
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:33,420
Scott: And it comes in these awesome hardcovers that are amazing on the shelf.

856
00:45:35,305 --> 00:45:36,200
Scott: So, yeah, I don't know.

857
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:45,020
Rym: My, my recommendation is still always, if you want, if you've never, if you've never seen any Gundam ever, I would almost say just watch War in the Pocket because it's kind of different.

858
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:47,039
Scott: Oh, you just want to watch the short ones.

859
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,840
Rym: Well, because War in the Pocket is really, really short.

860
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:52,040
Scott: 8th MS team, which is still the best Gundam ever made.

861
00:45:54,868 --> 00:45:55,240
Scott: It's funny.

862
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:02,078
Scott: Like the main Gundam is like, you know, the Gundam, but the best Gundam anime ever is still 8th MS team.

863
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:12,319
Rym: Well, it's a combination of, you know, like at PAX, a couple of people brought up the idea of the fun coefficient of like, what is the amount of enjoyment per hour spent that you get from a media?

864
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:18,660
Rym: And because they're so short, the ad, like the average quality ends up being way high.

865
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,820
Rym: I mean, original Gundam has a lot of points.

866
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,998
Rym: We're kind of drags for a while.

867
00:46:22,844 --> 00:46:23,400
Scott: Uh, yeah.

868
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,011
Rym: Yeah.

869
00:46:25,987 --> 00:46:26,595
Rym: And don't watch F91.

870
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:35,920
Rym: That thing was just, so the other thing that's interesting is the character designs.

871
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:41,900
Rym: Remind me much more of like a Wings of Oniyamis than they remind me of older Gundams.

872
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:47,520
Rym: The faces and the fact that all the hair colors are natural tones.

873
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,639
Rym: It's all browns and blacks.

874
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:50,797
Scott: I guess so.

875
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,680
Rym: Very non like non stereotypical anime hair stuff.

876
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,980
Rym: The hair is much more natural.

877
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,740
Rym: So as a result, everyone would look identical if they didn't do really different faces.

878
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:03,399
Rym: So the characters all have pretty unique faces.

879
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,920
Scott: Well, I mean, Gundam characters tend to have really unique faces.

880
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,740
Rym: A little bit compared to older Gundams.

881
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,340
Rym: But that might just be partly higher animation quality, bigger budgets.

882
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:22,479
Scott: I mean, you know, the animation and everything, you know, the production quality of this in general is just, you know, it's like, it's like they used to spend a million dollars in OAVs in the eighties.

883
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,018
Scott: It's like that.

884
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:24,132
Scott: It's like, whoa, holy snap.

885
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:25,939
Scott: Look at them robots.

886
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:26,444
Scott: Whoa.

887
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:33,977
Rym: Compare this to a crystal, which has like the lowest that has the bare minimum production qualities.

888
00:47:34,372 --> 00:47:34,538
Scott: Yep.

889
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,560
Rym: If only crystal had gotten this kind of budget.

890
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:38,960
Rym: Yeah.

891
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:39,739
Rym: This kind of love.

892
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,859
Rym: I feel like at least the people involved in this, if only it had been an OAV.

893
00:47:43,586 --> 00:47:43,700
Rym: Yeah.

894
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,780
Rym: Well, the people involved in this, I think we're doing it not just out of money, but out of, you know, they're like love for Gundam.

895
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,920
Scott: Well, I think it was like, you know, Gundam project.

896
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:53,800
Scott: Oh my God.

897
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,136
Rym: Yeah.

898
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,840
Rym: Well, because Gundam will never die.

899
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,980
Rym: Gundam is one of those things that will continue to have things forever.

900
00:48:00,223 --> 00:48:06,797
Scott: Uh, eventually there will be people, all the people who cared about Gundam will be dead and there won't be enough left.

901
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,320
Rym: They might, we could foster in a new generation.

902
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,580
Scott: How many new kids are going to watch, you know, UC Gundams?

903
00:48:15,662 --> 00:48:17,100
Scott: Be the unicorn or otherwise.

904
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,900
Rym: So Kazuhiro Furahashi is the director.

905
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:20,500
Rym: Okay.

906
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,380
Rym: And it's notable because he's directed a ton of stuff.

907
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,619
Rym: Like most of his credits are actually director.

908
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:36,740
Rym: And a lot of the things he's directed are, in my opinion, very clinically well done, but also kind of emotionally sterile.

909
00:48:37,921 --> 00:48:39,299
Rym: Uh, Get Backers.

910
00:48:39,422 --> 00:48:39,573
Scott: Yup.

911
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:39,938
Scott: Okay.

912
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:40,938
Rym: He actually directed that.

913
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,899
Rym: Uh, Chevalier Deon.

914
00:48:43,283 --> 00:48:43,476
Scott: Okay.

915
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:43,710
Scott: Yeah.

916
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:44,718
Rym: He directed that.

917
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:51,472
Rym: Uh, but then there's some, or, uh, uh, you're under arrest, the TV and the OAV, which I was never- Classics that we totally forgot about.

918
00:48:51,492 --> 00:48:52,360
Scott: that even existed.

919
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,280
Rym: We've never reviewed that on Geeknights, I don't think.

920
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:58,600
Scott: Old school, like kind of comedy anime is the kind of anime club material.

921
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,819
Rym: Those are the kind of buddy comedies, like a Gunsmith Catch that we were just really into back then.

922
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,600
Scott: It's like, oh my God, it's territory.

923
00:49:05,781 --> 00:49:12,220
Rym: And, uh, so out of all that, all that stuff and there's other things I could mention, uh, he also directed Binchotan.

924
00:49:13,563 --> 00:49:15,359
Scott: Oh, the, uh, the little moe cute thingy.

925
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:20,739
Rym: That was the last moe thing we ever saw before someone told us what moe was.

926
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:26,800
Scott: That was before we realized- There's nothing but like this girl with a lump of coal doing nothing.

927
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:28,720
Rym: Oh my God, this show is adorable.

928
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:33,680
Rym: And then older, wiser fan boy was like, you know, that's just porn for creepy people.

929
00:49:34,101 --> 00:49:37,200
Scott: They care what they want to get with a girl that's like one inch tall.

930
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,259
Rym: No, they're really into the idea that she's pure and that gets them off.

931
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:43,800
Scott: She's pure, but she has a lump of coal, which is dirty.

932
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,380
Scott: I don't know.

933
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,040
Rym: Yeah, that was when a cute anime was almost ruined for me forever when I learned the terrible truth of moe.

934
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,059
Scott: Yotsuba exists.

935
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:51,799
Rym: Yup.

936
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,275
Scott: We're good.

937
00:49:53,286 --> 00:49:53,978
Rym: And bunny drop.

938
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,016
Rym: Don't forget bunny drop.

939
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,480
Scott: Only watch the anime.

940
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,157
Scott: Don't read the manga.

941
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:13,459
Rym: I'm still amazed that this one guy on YouTube, when we posted that, uh, judge anime by its cover panel, he was really, really fucking mad at us for spoiling the, uh, the fact that the girl and the dad, uh, have sex and get married.

942
00:50:15,252 --> 00:50:15,520
Scott: I don't know.

943
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,180
Scott: I don't know exactly how far it goes, but it definitely goes.

944
00:50:18,441 --> 00:50:23,739
Scott: It goes in that direction for reals, and it should not go even one millimeter in that direction.

945
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:24,220
Rym: Yup.

946
00:50:25,803 --> 00:50:27,160
Scott: The anime ended at the correct moment.

947
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,060
Rym: So, GeekNights is back and we'll be back for like two weeks and then I'll be in Australia.

948
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:39,340
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

949
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:44,439
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

950
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,880
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

951
00:50:50,142 --> 00:50:52,820
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

952
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,560
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
