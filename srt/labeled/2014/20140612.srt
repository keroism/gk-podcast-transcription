00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,570
Rym: It's Thursday June 12th 2014.

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:20,510
Rym: I'm Rym Scott and this is GeekNights tonight the shit that Rym and or Scott don't give shits about.

3
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:29,065
Rym: Let's do this GeekNights titles now with swearing.

4
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:31,270
Scott: you just started the show before I could find a news.

5
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,089
Rym: Well there is big news.

6
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:42,870
Rym: Apparently OJ Simpson murdered somebody you don't say I. just today I noticed multiple articles kind of popping up in all my different feeds.

7
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:44,218
Rym: It was all about OJ.

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,144
Rym: the farc one fell.

9
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:46,030
Rym: he had the best headline.

10
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:47,055
Rym: Can you believe?

11
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:49,830
Rym: some people think that OJ actually murdered someone?

12
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,748
Scott: You don't say?

13
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:59,358
Rym: And I couldn't figure out why we were all talking about OJ When the Rym started talking about it.

14
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,269
Scott: I was like why is anyone talking about OJ?

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,652
Rym: That's like what did he?

16
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:04,337
Rym: and then do something new?

17
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:11,904
Scott: and I remembered something and it's that's weird because my memory is not the greatest But it's the 20-year anniversary of OJ, and you know how.

18
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:12,386
Scott: I know that.

19
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:14,318
Rym: I'm really curious How you know that?

20
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:14,823
Scott: because OJ?

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:35,106
Scott: Happened on the during the Stanley Cup finals in 1994 which I normally wouldn't remember except the Rangers are in the Stanley Cup finals in 1994 and also in 2014 and also I predict in 2034. so watch out people are gonna be talking about OJ in June of 2013 OJ.

22
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:40,041
Scott: In June of 2034 OJ is gonna be hot.

23
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:42,430
Scott: I would buy up some OJ merchandise also.

24
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:43,977
Scott: I've got you know what I have.

25
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:53,278
Scott: you buy up some OJ merchandise in like you know 2033 you should sell it in 2044 cuz that'll be the 50-year anniversary.

26
00:01:53,338 --> 00:02:00,709
Rym: got to be careful though because sometimes those things just disappear Like OJ might not actually be remembered by then.

27
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:06,448
Scott: Well look I'm telling you if you have a bloody glove or two you can make money on that.

28
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:16,338
Rym: I Do have some OJ memorabilia though, so I was at a pog convention during the trial And I have two OJ pogs.

29
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:20,010
Rym: They're two slammers one says guilty and one says innocent.

30
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:25,110
Rym: They were two dollars each Which was pretty cheap for a slammer at a pog convention.

31
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,422
Scott: I should go into the closet my parents house and dig out the pogs.

32
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,550
Rym: should we do a show on pogs have we?

33
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,618
Rym: I don't think so.

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,569
Rym: you want to play pogs.

35
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:33,874
Rym: We should play.

36
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:38,850
Rym: we got to play it again with our adult sensibilities before we can properly review that complex game.

37
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:42,423
Scott: It's really shitty compared to something like say jungle speed.

38
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:44,130
Rym: ah, but there's more to it than that.

39
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,676
Rym: I mean Americans all played it wrong.

40
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:47,141
Scott: They didn't actually gamble.

41
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:49,650
Rym: No they didn't use actual pogs.

42
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:50,876
Scott: Oh with the staple in.

43
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:51,560
Rym: yeah, they didn't have.

44
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,550
Scott: I had because it was hard to get real pogs.

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,574
Scott: I think I had exactly.

46
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:55,617
Rym: you know what you could.

47
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:58,768
Rym: you could at least bootleg them by putting staples under American pogs.

48
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:04,767
Scott: Exactly one real pog with the staple in it and one side fuzzy and everything.

49
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:05,490
Scott: and you know what?

50
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:10,330
Scott: That kind of staple that's in there is sort of like this perfect staple.

51
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,670
Scott: It's not a staple that you can get from your stapler.

52
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:16,910
Scott: Yeah, but you need without any state me from like a staple go to the hardware store.

53
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,312
Scott: You can get it.

54
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,480
Rym: like the game didn't even work.

55
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,194
Rym: not that it was much of a game Don't get me wrong.

56
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:27,169
Rym: It's just I. I remember the OJ era being the era where pogs were a thing.

57
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,094
Scott: Hmm.

58
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:36,289
Rym: and now thinking back because we're talking about the anniversary I do remember the because you know many of you younger people today like people are in high school middle school.

59
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:41,849
Rym: now I don't think you understand what mass media was like when we were in middle school.

60
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:46,270
Rym: The there wasn't an internet that let people see news the way that we have it now.

61
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:56,524
Rym: and even if you did have access to internets to see news things you definitely could not look at that during school or Anywhere other than your kitchen where your 486 was hanging out.

62
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:01,169
Rym: So and even then only if your mom wasn't using the phone line.

63
00:04:02,096 --> 00:04:12,769
Rym: so the trial was pretty much the only unifying aspect of pop culture other than football and Perhaps other sports at the time.

64
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:24,986
Rym: so my school would give everyone an update every morning after we watched the Propaganda channel 1 news bullshit, then the morning announcements included an update on the OJ trial.

65
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:29,020
Rym: really yeah Wow Everybody watched the OJ trial.

66
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:35,461
Scott: the only OJ the only time I did Infiltrated our school is when the verdict was declared.

67
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:37,527
Scott: it got whispered around from class to class.

68
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,653
Rym: Wow whispered around I mean one.

69
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:44,249
Rym: I knew all about judge Ito his shenanigans, and he was a like minor celebrity.

70
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:46,809
Rym: in fact I saw someone who was dressed up as judge Ito.

71
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:49,117
Rym: I guess they were playing before.

72
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:50,702
Rym: I knew that cosplay was the thing.

73
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:57,870
Rym: you know it was at the pog convention That there were a bunch of people dressed up as characters from the trial.

74
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,898
Scott: So you got pogs from my pog convention.

75
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,829
Scott: the only place I ever got pogs was a these temporary Stands guys set up in the middle of the mall hallways.

76
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,460
Scott: And also I went to Florida once during.

77
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:19,961
Scott: it must have been the summer of you know 93 94 and We went to like a flea market like an indoor flea market kind of place And there were a couple stands that had like I got some pogs.

78
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:23,718
Scott: I got some magic cards, so I'm you know I must have been in 7th 8th grade.

79
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:40,347
Rym: but anyway because we had those TVs for that propaganda channel 1 bullshit and Because everyone in the entire country was like obsessed with this thing I mean I haven't had a friend who had a screensaver that played the Simpsons theme and just showed a white Ford Bronco driving down the freeway.

80
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,202
Rym: Okay It was the Midwest.

81
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:43,869
Rym: what else do you do?

82
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:59,050
Rym: but When the trial was nearing its conclusion and the verdict was going to be announced the entire middle school stopped classes And put the live trial on the TVs that we had in every single classroom because we had that bullshit channel one thing.

83
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:18,022
Rym: So we all watched the verdict get read live and as soon as they said not guilty all the football bro dudes Jumped up cheering and yelling and screaming about how happy they were that OJ was not guilty and everyone who was smart was quietly dead inside.

84
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:24,624
Rym: ah OJ you know if you didn't do it you really shouldn't have written a book called.

85
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:26,853
Rym: if I did it were you explain how you Did it.

86
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:28,628
Scott: listen no one ever said?

87
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:31,108
Scott: No one ever said OJ was smart, okay?

88
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,236
Rym: Well he was smart enough to get away with murder.

89
00:06:33,256 --> 00:06:36,630
Scott: also have to consider the fact right like what really complex murder.

90
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:44,440
Scott: I mean you to consider the fact that seriously right You know what we know now about football and brain damage.

91
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:47,087
Rym: Oh, I didn't think of that angle right.

92
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:56,150
Scott: like you know It's like if this trial happened today They might be going in with a defense like look OJ's head is basically bashed in from playing football.

93
00:06:56,873 --> 00:06:59,122
Scott: Right he's not in his right mind or whatever.

94
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:00,087
Rym: I mean like Chris Benoit.

95
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:04,425
Rym: I mean Sports injuries can make people go crazy.

96
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:13,034
Rym: sharing yeah Uh but still it was a pretty complex murder plot all things considered I guess.

97
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:20,386
Rym: so ah oh well OJ is what he is and oh my god.

98
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:24,239
Rym: I just noticed saw something I never realized the original cover for the book he wrote.

99
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:29,115
Rym: if I did it the color of the word if is different from the Rest of the words in the title.

100
00:07:29,135 --> 00:07:30,722
Rym: so from a distance.

101
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:31,806
Rym: It just says I did it.

102
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:40,209
Rym: yeah I Wonder where Kato Kaelin's up to what?

103
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,930
Rym: Remember much about the OJ trial Nearly as much as you did I didn't pay attention much.

104
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,884
Rym: It was more that if you live in a place where everyone around you pays attention to a thing You learn a lot about that thing.

105
00:07:54,904 --> 00:08:03,090
Rym: by osmosis I mean think about how much you know about weird subculture cultures on the internet just because you encountered them tangentially.

106
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:07,430
Rym: We know a lot about Homestuck kids even though we don't read any Homestuck.

107
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:17,993
Rym: We know a lot less about Homestuck that we might think yeah But we know more than say grandma or anyone over the aid anyone else over the age of 19.

108
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:19,561
Rym: Yes, that is in fact.

109
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,170
Scott: We know that Homestuck exists.

110
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:21,834
Scott: That is a lot.

111
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,430
Scott: and candy corn horns are thing that is Homestuck related.

112
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:29,891
Rym: It took me a long time to realize that candy corn horns were a thing and then to figure out what they were kind of like.

113
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:37,969
Rym: how and I'm gonna admit something I Thought Slenderman was from a video game until like six months

114
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:47,490
Scott: ago The video game that I thought there was some connection between Slenderman and that video game that people cosplayed as two enemy of Austin's ago With like the baseball bat and the white heads or whatever it was.

115
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,299
Rym: Oh, I could see why you would think that.

116
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,330
Scott: that French RPG or whatever the fuck that thing.

117
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,461
Rym: I could see that that aesthetic actually kind of fit.

118
00:08:53,481 --> 00:09:01,310
Rym: so I could see why you would think that yeah But I thought it was from a video game because I encountered it for the first time of all places on VG cats.

119
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:03,296
Rym: And did you cats made a funny joke?

120
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:07,249
Scott: there are various games and game mods that have like put Slenderman characters in like.

121
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,842
Scott: I think You can play Minecraft and encounter Slenderman.

122
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:10,445
Rym: Oh, you can't.

123
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,350
Rym: Slenderman is ways.

124
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,281
Rym: It's a. it's a. you know the term for it is fake lore.

125
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,550
Rym: now that that's what people call that kind of stuff.

126
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:26,640
Rym: It's the situation where someone makes up something that has the trappings of folklore and then other people Extend that until it eventually becomes Paul Bunyan.

127
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:29,570
Scott: you mean an urban legend sort of.

128
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:42,350
Rym: But they actually they already have a word for this they make a distinction between urban legends and fake lore in that Urban legends tend to not get expanded upon and tend to survive as their core mostly unedited over time.

129
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:44,274
Rym: I mean I don't know about the story.

130
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:52,703
Rym: look at older urban legends like the the dress that was stolen from the corpse that was filled with Embalming fluid and caused the girl to die after the prom.

131
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:53,828
Scott: I've never heard that one in my life.

132
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:57,504
Rym: really What about the hook on the door from makeout point?

133
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:02,556
Scott: I've heard it make out point Hooks on any doors Scott How do you not this?

134
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:06,430
Rym: the story is to put it in a summary a guy and a girl?

135
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,644
Rym: Drive their car out to go make out it make out point.

136
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:10,447
Scott: got that story.

137
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:11,754
Scott: so far We're on the same page.

138
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:18,579
Rym: yep, and there were reports that there is a deranged Madman killing people with a hook hand.

139
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:23,275
Scott: I know there's a story of a deranged man killing people With a hook hand.

140
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:26,649
Scott: I the specific detail of the hook hand is not in my mind.

141
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:29,689
Rym: Do I have to read you the actual legend at this point?

142
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:31,315
Rym: Hand hook a tool.

143
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:33,746
Rym: no I want the story not the my head not my.

144
00:10:33,806 --> 00:10:39,215
Rym: I don't want the movie Tropes, I don't want the movie hook Blah blah blah.

145
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:41,708
Scott: no it's main slash hook head not Miami.

146
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:45,597
Scott: yeah TV trope of hook hand.

147
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:48,930
Rym: so well there I found a weird part of the internet.

148
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,319
Rym: I'm just gonna back out of where I just went.

149
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,030
Scott: tropes calm is not a weird part of the internet.

150
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,150
Rym: No, I got into a ghetto within TV tropes of all things that are related solely to hooks.

151
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:58,603
Scott: Yeah, yes, how awesome is that?

152
00:10:58,804 --> 00:10:59,650
Rym: kind of like the goal yesterday?

153
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,702
Rym: We looked up a sailor wound video, and you know we ended up on.

154
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:02,930
Rym: we ended up in a YouTube ghetto.

155
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:06,747
Rym: There was nothing but videos of every Sailor Scout dying.

156
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:24,360
Rym: sweet Yeah, so we watched those for a while anyway, so they start to make out and then they hear a rustling noise and a tap tap tap on the window and The guys like come on let's just keep making out and the girls like no This is I'm scared.

157
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,930
Rym: just go home and the guy's super pissed.

158
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:28,163
Rym: But then he drives her home, and then he goes home.

159
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:28,726
Rym: the next morning.

160
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:32,219
Rym: he wakes up And he goes to his car and oh my god.

161
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,767
Rym: There's a hook hand embedded in the door.

162
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:36,880
Rym: handle done done done.

163
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:41,765
Rym: That's one of the most famous urban legends in modern history.

164
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:44,718
Scott: Oh the way I know it is you go to make out point.

165
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:47,430
Scott: this is psycho killer on the loose on the radio.

166
00:11:47,691 --> 00:12:01,232
Scott: They turn off the radio they make out right they hear something while they're making out But they ignore it and then while they're driving home Dun dun dun guy in the backseat murders him and then next day They find a car accident.

167
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:04,016
Rym: stories like that don't become Paul Bunyan stories.

168
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:05,859
Rym: They stay as urban legends.

169
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,591
Rym: I Guess.

170
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:11,461
Rym: maybe also it's interesting that Slender Man kind of became real.

171
00:12:11,842 --> 00:12:20,170
Rym: now that you know two girls actually tried to murder someone Because they thought he existed we can make up pretty much any story and get people to murder of each other exactly.

172
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:21,654
Rym: I just find this all interesting.

173
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,000
Rym: Slender Man is becoming more and more real as time goes on.

174
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:26,584
Scott: Yeah, he's in the closet.

175
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:26,968
Scott: watch out.

176
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:30,099
Rym: So was that enough time for you to find some news.

177
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,304
Scott: I found a crappy news.

178
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:35,737
Scott: all right, so Tesla the people make the electric cars right.

179
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:40,686
Scott: they're doing something that is mildly interesting more interesting than any news at e3 at least so whatevs.

180
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:48,889
Scott: It says first like the headline was like Tesla opens patents, and I'm like wait a minute.

181
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:50,818
Scott: Patents are open right.

182
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,130
Scott: that's the thing with a patent as opposed to a trade secret.

183
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,410
Scott: Is that people can't use your patent if it's a legit patent right without paying you money?

184
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,410
Scott: But you can just go to the patent office or even Google patents and just look at any freaking patent.

185
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:05,213
Scott: It's just.

186
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,136
Rym: it's like the trade-off.

187
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:09,468
Rym: if you want to have patent protections you have to give up the secret right.

188
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:13,570
Scott: so it's like if I Figure out how to cook the most delicious cookie.

189
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,710
Scott: No one's ever cooked cookie like this before with some new ingredient or some shit that I invent.

190
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,096
Scott: It's a real legitimate invention.

191
00:13:19,136 --> 00:13:20,863
Scott: somehow my new brand new.

192
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:24,520
Scott: unlike any other cookie recipe You freeze the cookies to bake them.

193
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,163
Scott: freeze baking.

194
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,429
Scott: sure I made it up.

195
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:41,163
Scott: Okay If I invent freeze baking and I want to patent that so people have to pay me when they freeze bake or have freeze baking Businesses I have to tell everyone the secret of freeze baking Specifically the government and then via the government the entire world the secrets of freeze baking.

196
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:45,459
Scott: so we already know all the secrets of Tesla Car batteries that they've told anyone.

197
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,590
Scott: they're not secrets really right.

198
00:13:48,311 --> 00:14:00,919
Scott: But the news is they decided to be like look if you want to use our patents legitimately to make electric cars for reals go for it and It's sort of like okay other companies.

199
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:01,943
Scott: Don't have the balls to do it.

200
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:03,227
Scott: good on you good on you.

201
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:03,850
Scott: golf clap.

202
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,524
Rym: Yep, also kind of falls in the realm of the really who's gonna use any of these patents?

203
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:12,326
Scott: anyone who wants to build an electric car Doesn't really have the means to do so.

204
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,195
Rym: Well we'll see what happens.

205
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:22,232
Scott: who has the desire and means to use these patents that will compete with them and actually beat them at anything eventually.

206
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:27,246
Scott: smarter traditional car companies, maybe Maybe but you know what?

207
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:35,354
Scott: They'll probably just like if it was if someone if like Ford just looks at all these patents and starts to make Tesla the cars That are better than Tesla.

208
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:47,679
Scott: They'll probably just end up buying Tesla not because oh this Tesla technology We have to get because we got it all in the patents, but because hey let's not build an electric car factory look There's one right there.

209
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:48,386
Scott: Let's just buy it.

210
00:14:50,611 --> 00:14:55,930
Rym: Man the thing is the the thing that bothers me the most about telling the technology and Tesla is a company whatever.

211
00:14:56,452 --> 00:15:05,728
Rym: But it's the whole fact that one of the biggest things holding these cars back is the ancient protective laws on car dealerships that prevent car companies from just selling cars direct.

212
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:12,909
Rym: I mean If I have to buy a car again like if we ever move out of New York And I got it, you know because if that happens I gotta buy a car, okay?

213
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,784
Rym: I pretty much just want to go to a website like Toyota's website.

214
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,270
Rym: Just pick a car Amazon.

215
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,936
Scott: Yeah, as easy as buying something Amazon.

216
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:21,804
Rym: I want to pick a car pick the options.

217
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:22,426
Rym: Oh look.

218
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,410
Rym: There's the MSRP.

219
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:24,844
Rym: I'll just pay that.

220
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,139
Rym: yeah I lived.

221
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:34,674
Rym: I literally think Negotiating and haggling over car prices is one of the most fucked things that we do as a country that we could fix But refuse to.

222
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:44,110
Scott: huh you know a good way to solve this would be Maybe if car dealerships weren't so influential in their local governments.

223
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:47,610
Rym: Oh, is this a plug for Lawrence Lessig's Super PAC?

224
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:54,330
Scott: I'm just saying all problems that we complain about most of the time 90% of them are really just one problem.

225
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,279
Scott: Especially this one is definitely that one problem.

226
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:04,500
Rym: actually my news for the second half of the show Is very relevant in relation to what you just said.

227
00:16:04,681 --> 00:16:19,535
Scott: anyway if you didn't know there's In the United States there's a PAC and it's basically Only trying to get people elected who are not corrupt and will not you know be evil and don't want to take money from Corporations.

228
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:28,610
Scott: yeah the way they're doing it is give them money And then they use the money to basically play the game To get people who don't want to play the game to win the game.

229
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,280
Scott: And then if we do that enough to imagine a game.

230
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:37,790
Rym: imagine if if you win the Stanley Cup You get to change a rule in hockey for the next season.

231
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,095
Scott: It's like so.

232
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:41,927
Scott: then once you get into the ace square you make the rules.

233
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:42,490
Scott: yep.

234
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:49,810
Scott: So if I win the Stanley Cup But you gotta play by the person whose rules are in currently in the a square to get out of the a square.

235
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:51,456
Rym: And I got a really fast team.

236
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:53,182
Rym: I remove icings.

237
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:55,349
Rym: those just aren't a rule anymore.

238
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:01,800
Rym: Anyway So an actual news isn't just OJ.

239
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,329
Rym: I just want to point this out because it's kind of amazing.

240
00:17:04,672 --> 00:17:08,589
Rym: There's a bunch of ads running in New York City right now as I learned from some news articles about them.

241
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:09,714
Scott: Where are they running?

242
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:11,343
Rym: I guess TV and radio.

243
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:12,550
Scott: Oh, that's why I haven't seen them.

244
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,566
Scott: Yeah, I usually see subway and billboard ads because I'm in fucking Times Square.

245
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:27,740
Rym: They are Trying to convince people in New York that rents are actually way too low And that if rents get raised nobody will believe that.

246
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,421
Scott: who lives in New York?

247
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:31,810
Rym: that if rents aren't raised all our buildings will collapse?

248
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:37,710
Scott: Because no one will tell me only the ones owned by slum lords will collapse and that's already been true.

249
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,786
Rym: Nobody would ever build a building or maintain real estate in New York.

250
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:46,384
Rym: if we don't significantly Raise rent then how come the buildings haven't collapsed yet.

251
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:47,469
Rym: Yeah, you know what?

252
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,983
Rym: Landlords in New York City can eat a bag of dicks.

253
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:54,038
Rym: I Eminent domain, I think the city.

254
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,550
Scott: Well, I mean if your building is falling apart, you know what happens.

255
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:57,742
Scott: They take your building.

256
00:17:57,782 --> 00:18:04,588
Rym: Oh, hey, yep Plus eat, let's say we had some sort of rent stabilization and we build millions of additional apartments in New York City.

257
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,318
Rym: one They would all still get rented.

258
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:14,070
Rym: because the demand for apartments is so crazy here And I don't know why they only fill the World Trade Center with office space.

259
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,419
Scott: Why I can tell you why they put apartments in there?

260
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,929
Rym: because if there's more apartments rents might go down.

261
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:31,086
Rym: You Don't say and it's not like real estate in New York is not barring global warming destroying the city or nukes destroying the city Literally the most perfect investment you could ever make.

262
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:35,140
Rym: so Really have zero sympathy for anyone who actually owns land here.

263
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:41,280
Rym: and I think New York City should eminent domain all Residential property in all of New York City and manage it.

264
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:44,170
Scott: Maybe not manage it itself, but I don't know about that.

265
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,265
Scott: How would I say how would you feel if you owned a building and were a good landlord?

266
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:49,354
Rym: Oh, fuck you You know why it's New York.

267
00:18:49,414 --> 00:18:54,390
Rym: New York is so special and weird at this point that we can't just owning personal property.

268
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:00,289
Scott: Well, you can at least pay people for these buildings that they up eminent domain means you pay them a fair market price.

269
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:08,543
Scott: This would cost the city billions, but the fair market price Will suddenly be changed dramatically by the legislation that you just passed.

270
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,065
Rym: what it though?

271
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:10,428
Rym: because what if you don't even change rents?

272
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:11,030
Rym: because really?

273
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:20,945
Rym: The only difference is if the city owns say all the real estate on the Upper East Side You're gonna fight every landlord ever in court forever over the price of each and every building forever.

274
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:22,710
Rym: Yeah, you know what you're gonna.

275
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,759
Rym: All those building assessments are gonna be questioned in every single detail.

276
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,326
Rym: Yep And you know what?

277
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,682
Rym: Fuck them do it because once you do it the city could just make.

278
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:39,618
Scott: imagine all that's like building is a cathedral by the time Even one building is actually eminent domain.

279
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,785
Scott: The person who decided to do that will be dead.

280
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:43,010
Rym: Yeah got a plan long term.

281
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:54,002
Rym: But imagine that because right now the reason I have no sympathy for these landlords is that realist like rental properties in New York City are Ridiculously profitable they could be a little less profitable.

282
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:56,230
Rym: It would be fine for everyone invested in this shit.

283
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:03,478
Scott: So if the city and I spend my whole life making enough money to buy a building and I buy the building I don't want to have to work anymore.

284
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:05,790
Scott: I just want to live off the fact that I own this building.

285
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,062
Scott: Yeah, if I can't do that, why the fuck did I buy a building?

286
00:20:09,102 --> 00:20:10,587
Rym: for I don't know fuck you.

287
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:11,149
Rym: It's New York.

288
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:14,290
Rym: Don't really care about you in your opinion.

289
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:16,009
Scott: But I want to own a building.

290
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:23,791
Scott: So I own a building someone else But I won't be able to just live my whole life without having to work simply by owning a building if it's not a New York Building.

291
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:25,316
Rym: well then own something else.

292
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,363
Rym: that makes similar amounts of money somewhere else.

293
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:28,206
Scott: What else can I buy?

294
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:29,310
Scott: that just spits out money?

295
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:33,898
Scott: many businesses But that involves putting work in.

296
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:39,360
Scott: if I don't buy the buy an existing business is already profitable But I have to run the business.

297
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,286
Rym: No, just own it.

298
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:40,809
Rym: Don't run it.

299
00:20:41,852 --> 00:20:44,210
Scott: Is there any few businesses that you can just own without having to do it?

300
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,800
Rym: Most businesses are just owned at least most larger businesses.

301
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,044
Scott: You usually have to do something.

302
00:20:49,606 --> 00:20:53,075
Rym: Yeah own it Have put up capital for it.

303
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:58,210
Rym: only if it's like a sports team managing people who then manage and do all the actual work.

304
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,779
Scott: That's has to be a large business to just own.

305
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,490
Rym: Yeah, if you can afford one of these big buildings in New York.

306
00:21:03,651 --> 00:21:05,989
Scott: You can I'm not saying if you can afford to buy like IBM.

307
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:12,930
Scott: I'm looking I'm not looking to own some luxury condom and stress you like this building Like, you know someplace has got like four apartments in it.

308
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:20,130
Rym: So why don't we start with something simple just buy the ultra expensive super rich residential real estate around Central Park.

309
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:21,836
Rym: Have it be owned by the city.

310
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:23,462
Scott: You can't even buy a square foot.

311
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:23,863
Scott: Yeah.

312
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:25,770
Scott: Oh, you mean you mean us buying it?

313
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,510
Scott: I'm like you can't afford a square foot of that.

314
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:40,296
Rym: No, if the city own it and then the city will just keep the rents ridiculously high because if you're a billionaire You'll pay whatever to live in one of those places and then that profit just becomes Revenue for the city.

315
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:40,819
Scott: BAM.

316
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,010
Scott: We already have property tax on those properties.

317
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:48,650
Rym: It's not enough because those buildings are ridiculously profitable and we can just raise property tax on those properties.

318
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:53,017
Rym: I have a. the thing is we can't Because of Cuomo.

319
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,050
Rym: Okay, we can't do anything because of Cuomo.

320
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:55,754
Rym: It's all.

321
00:21:55,854 --> 00:21:57,967
Rym: state politics prevents New York City from doing anything in.

322
00:21:57,987 --> 00:21:58,470
Scott: just do it.

323
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,470
Scott: Anyway, send the New York police over to the building and find the landlord and be like we are collecting taxes.

324
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:05,798
Scott: No, well, the city law says yes.

325
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,107
Rym: We said it over like the sheriff of Nottingham.

326
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:08,730
Scott: exactly.

327
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:16,662
Rym: We should go one step further and just use our local police to secede from the state Sure, or just go conquer Albany.

328
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,330
Scott: We could probably beat the state troopers easily.

329
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:19,916
Scott: Yeah, we got more helicopters in.

330
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:20,298
Scott: that might be.

331
00:22:20,318 --> 00:22:21,623
Rym: we pay all the state troopers.

332
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:32,838
Rym: if we just stop sending money upstate Things of the day.

333
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:39,100
Rym: So there's a photographer named Arthur Tress and what I'm sharing here is a small collection of photos.

334
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:45,299
Rym: One they're beautiful beautiful black-and-white photos taken all in New York City in the 60s.

335
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:47,591
Rym: Okay, so like late 60s.

336
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,450
Rym: so it looks like a desolate hellhole in most places.

337
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,333
Scott: it wasn't too great.

338
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:55,917
Rym: parts of it are also taken in New Jersey and That's even worse.

339
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:58,627
Rym: Basically, I'm gonna let me find it.

340
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:00,693
Rym: There's an actual description quote.

341
00:23:00,994 --> 00:23:11,360
Rym: Tess spoke with children about their dreams often nightmares and Would then photograph them experiencing these dreams in a safe stage setting.

342
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:17,717
Rym: Okay, so these are staged photographs of children experiencing their nightmares and they're just.

343
00:23:17,737 --> 00:23:18,920
Rym: they're amazing photography.

344
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:31,247
Rym: So that kids nightmare is that kids nightmare apparently being trapped in the TV with Tommy gun holding a gun I'll Tommy gun and the background is a I guess a bunch of buildings Trying to figure what buildings those are.

345
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,675
Rym: that looks like someplace in the Bronx.

346
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:35,220
Rym: I can't tell that looks brown.

347
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:36,652
Scott: Those aren't familiar buildings.

348
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:37,519
Rym: now that looks Bronx.

349
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,508
Rym: He also be surprised.

350
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:40,620
Scott: you can look at photos of me If you know, New York.

351
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:47,926
Scott: You can look at photos in New York from like the 19 O's and if you see like one building or a street you recognize You know, I know where that is.

352
00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:50,380
Rym: Yeah, because a lot of that stuff is not actually changed.

353
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:55,239
Rym: Yeah In fact the things that change the most are just like the fashion of the people in those photos.

354
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:58,130
Rym: The cars usually out the roads are in the old days.

355
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,860
Rym: People are all wearing black suits and black coats and hats.

356
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,909
Rym: No more nowadays They're wearing black suits and black coats, but no hat.

357
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:07,511
Scott: the old picture will have streetcars in it and it'll be a lot filthier Yep, old enough.

358
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:08,119
Rym: You'll get horses.

359
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:14,733
Rym: There's a lot of pictures you can find that overlay like the old and the new on that that exact thing you're talking about Has been my thing of the day more than once.

360
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:20,120
Rym: Yeah Though that kids afraid of ice hockey, I guess Jason mask hockey is pretty scary.

361
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,792
Scott: But that was that photo was taken before Jason for he's existed.

362
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:25,818
Rym: Yeah, that's still scary though.

363
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,466
Rym: Sure All right Got a got thing of the day.

364
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:32,334
Scott: It's also a photo gallery.

365
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:53,688
Scott: Oh photo time Yeah, so I guess there was more than one person who did this, but this is the flicker account of the Bruce Sterling and Apparently people have been going in the Ukraine to the former Maybe current depending on your interpretation The president of Ukraine's vacant mansion.

366
00:24:54,129 --> 00:25:03,294
Scott: people are busting in and taking mad photos and you can see What the life of not a rich person but a wealthy person really looks like.

367
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:05,780
Scott: dude has a boxing ring in his house.

368
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,517
Rym: He has a 3d theater like the kind of theater you'd watch movies in but it had.

369
00:25:10,617 --> 00:25:15,784
Rym: it's gigantic But it has a grand total of nine Leather chairs in it.

370
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:21,040
Scott: every room like the walls and ceilings and whatever look like an opulent museum room.

371
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:29,426
Scott: you know of Middle Ages style with like gold foil leaf and shit everywhere and He's got like bas reliefs on the walls.

372
00:25:29,506 --> 00:25:37,984
Scott: who reliefs, you know of like guys, you know Greek dudes playing sports or whatever and It's pretty insane I don't even like.

373
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:39,249
Scott: no matter how rich I was.

374
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:45,219
Scott: if I suddenly had all the money on the world and I was just the king Everything I would still not live in a place anything like that.

375
00:25:45,572 --> 00:25:47,987
Rym: No But what I might live in is there's the Woolworth building.

376
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:52,100
Rym: apparently the top like 30 floors are being turned into apartments and cobble condos.

377
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:56,251
Scott: So they used to be the tallest building from what I gather a long time.

378
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:59,963
Rym: what I gather there are 30 floors being turned into Condos.

379
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:02,209
Scott: 30 apartments total 34 apartments.

380
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:02,891
Scott: Okay.

381
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:05,840
Scott: So one floor is gonna be split into four and the other ones top nine.

382
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,080
Rym: Yeah, so some of the apartments spend nine floors.

383
00:26:09,821 --> 00:26:12,712
Scott: Okay with private elevators, yep, that's pretty typical.

384
00:26:12,752 --> 00:26:14,720
Rym: Yeah, they're selling for over a hundred million.

385
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,952
Scott: I would see I wouldn't even need that.

386
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:19,542
Scott: I would need it most I Would.

387
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:21,219
Rym: I would live in that nine floor?

388
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,569
Rym: Monster apartment with a whole bunch of friends.

389
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:29,640
Scott: maybe if I had every take a lot of people Apparently it wouldn't take that many people.

390
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:38,816
Scott: I just most I would ever need to live in would be one room for like TV stuff Right like to sit on the couch and watch stuff and that room would probably have no windows.

391
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:39,759
Rym: that I wouldn't I wouldn't.

392
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:45,414
Rym: what I Primarily would need is a function space wherein I could have my own private like mini gaming cars

393
00:26:45,534 --> 00:27:00,140
Scott: like a room to have You know All my books and shit and sit quietly maybe almost on my desk of my computer in there a room with a bed in it and clothes and shit like that a Bathroom with a nice tight quality shower.

394
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:08,470
Scott: I would have the best kitchen you could ever you'd ever seen in the kitchen with like a Big fridge and a dishwasher and oven, you know all that stuff.

395
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:16,148
Scott: Maybe lots of counter space lots of cabinets more than one drawer A balcony or something like that.

396
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:33,391
Scott: right a nice roof access a planetarium maybe no I don't need a planet in my own planetarium Window with some views a place to put bikes and shit and you know, maybe Building amenities like a swimming pool Scott for like 15 or 20 million.

397
00:27:33,411 --> 00:27:36,420
Rym: you could have that in a borough other than Manhattan today.

398
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,159
Scott: That's I can have all that with like a house in the middle of I don't know Wyoming.

399
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:43,239
Rym: Oh, yeah If you want you go, okay.

400
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:50,440
Rym: So if you move to Arizona and somehow still have income then yes, you could have all of that pretty cheaply.

401
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:56,465
Rym: So in the meta moment the book of the book is a chemical for Liebowitz the precursor.

402
00:27:56,546 --> 00:27:57,489
Scott: actually continue reading it.

403
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:00,257
Scott: You're going away another business trip, right?

404
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:03,328
Scott: So if I read it probably I'll probably do when you get back.

405
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,442
Rym: Yep Well, apparently the book club book is still wool.

406
00:28:06,462 --> 00:28:09,489
Scott: I Didn't put it on my reminder thing.

407
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:20,594
Rym: I'm going to be in Istanbul for the first part of next week and I'm going to be in Munich for the second part of next week and I'll be spending A little bit of time in.

408
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:22,220
Rym: it looks like Dusseldorf.

409
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:33,065
Rym: So if you're in Munich, like I don't know Thursday I Pretty much have nothing to do but fuck around and hang out and my only real goal if you live anywhere near there Just take a train to it.

410
00:28:33,731 --> 00:28:43,702
Rym: my only real goal that afternoon is to find as many copies or at least one copy that I can do a high-res scan for Of the expansion to Hansa, Teutonica can't just find a scan online.

411
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:46,784
Rym: No, okay people have been looking for it All right.

412
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:51,585
Rym: Also, if you want to see us and a lot of other awesome people doing awesome stuff pretty

413
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,089
Scott: much anyone that matters Kinetic

414
00:28:53,149 --> 00:29:03,886
Rym: on Which is a convention that we have a big part of and that we also perform at and have been going to for a very long time it is it is on its way to being the next Dragon Con like It's actually growing it.

415
00:29:04,491 --> 00:29:08,280
Scott: Well, it's similar to Dragon Con and that it's one of the only cons.

416
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:13,819
Scott: that covers all areas of full spectrum geekery Exactly other other than that.

417
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,630
Scott: It's not too similar to Dragon Con.

418
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:21,030
Rym: It will be given time simply because the space it's in is hitting limitations already.

419
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,070
Rym: So we're starting to spread out into the rest of the city of Hartford.

420
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:27,615
Rym: That's true And for what it's worth the city is like.

421
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:29,401
Rym: you guys are the only thing we got.

422
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:36,670
Scott: so he's basically vacant cuz no one's here In downtown except during work hours on a weekday and you're here on a weekend.

423
00:29:36,872 --> 00:29:37,702
Scott: So it's a ghost town.

424
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:38,350
Scott: fill it with nerds.

425
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,949
Rym: So we've spread into like all the local bars and the theaters and all this stuff.

426
00:29:42,932 --> 00:29:51,432
Rym: I would not fly across the country or over an ocean to come to ConnectiCon If

427
00:29:51,512 --> 00:30:03,656
Scott: I could use a train bus or car to get to it in a reasonable amount of time and I could afford a hotel that was within close distance and the badges I would go to it if I didn't have a more pressing schedule.

428
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:06,888
Scott: conflict which there wouldn't be many things that would be more pressing.

429
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:11,190
Rym: and Like we said it is the full spectrum of geekery.

430
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:16,087
Rym: I cannot express to you the wide range of panel content on the at this convention now.

431
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:17,090
Scott: that might turn you off.

432
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,790
Scott: You might be being like well, I only care about games.

433
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:22,810
Scott: So why would I go to this con where most of its gonna be other shit?

434
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,390
Scott: I don't care about cuz I'm one of those non, you know branching out nerds.

435
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:26,949
Scott: Well, you know what?

436
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,103
Scott: There's enough of each thing that you can just do your one thing the whole time.

437
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:35,502
Scott: if you're just like want to play fighting games Or whatever you can do that the entire time.

438
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,989
Scott: at ConnectiCon they're having some crazy.

439
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:40,481
Scott: The con chair realize the League of Legends is popular.

440
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:42,650
Scott: He's running this mega League of Legends tournament.

441
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:44,110
Scott: So League of Legends is your thing.

442
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:48,850
Scott: You can go to ConnectiCon and play League of Legends pretty much the whole goddamn time and win crazy prizes.

443
00:30:49,151 --> 00:31:02,542
Rym: And if you care about things that aren't anime or video games I point out that there are very few conventions where there's any panel content, but the panel content we've got for those things is Above average compared to most fan cons as well.

444
00:31:02,682 --> 00:31:06,442
Scott: Yeah, so it's like no matter what your geekery is There'll be a panel or two for you to care.

445
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:06,785
Rym: Let's see.

446
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:11,184
Rym: We've got Power Rangers Q&A with some people who were Power Rangers.

447
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,850
Rym: It looks like oh my god guess thing.

448
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:18,130
Rym: We've got a hell hell which is basically anime hell but anything hell.

449
00:31:18,571 --> 00:31:34,558
Rym: Okay, we've got writing fiction through the female gaze team four-star I guess if you're into that sort of thing the early films of John Waters a sculpting workshop that you actually sculpt stuff in Money though right a little trivial amount of money.

450
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:42,090
Rym: some Doctor Who some Sherlock a bunch of anime an Adventure time panel a whole bunch of guests anime directors.

00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:51,003
Rym: You should know juggling 101 Jojo's Bazaar Adventure manly poses and you okay I can't a full-on cabaret.

452
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:53,943

453
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:56,424
Rym: This is a pretty awesome kind of.

454
00:31:56,444 --> 00:31:56,988
Rym: you should be there.

455
00:31:58,035 --> 00:32:00,590
Rym: So Scott this was a crab people episode to be sure.

456
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:02,032
Scott: Yeah, mr.

457
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:02,394
Scott: Crab.

458
00:32:02,614 --> 00:32:05,785
Rym: so you said when we were talking about what did the show?

459
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:07,170
Scott: I say that let's bring up the chat log.

460
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,417
Rym: Oh, let's bring up the chat logs.

461
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:09,162
Scott: that will kill time.

462
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,188
Rym: that will exactly.

463
00:32:10,268 --> 00:32:10,590
Rym: let's see.

464
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:18,525
Rym: I gotta bring up the chat log scrolling back and let me want to say once again This is the reason why I have a record of every instant messenger conversation.

465
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:19,869
Rym: I have ever had.

466
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:22,856
Rym: Since the days of ICQ.

467
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:26,690
Rym: I have logs of anything I have ever said to anyone or anyone has ever said to me.

468
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,530
Rym: However, Google's Historical archive search is actually not that great.

469
00:32:34,374 --> 00:32:35,147
Rym: Blah blah blah.

470
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:38,118

00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:12,496

00:34:54,563 --> 00:35:03,459
Rym: I kind of explained I'm reaching for a topic and Then Scott says and I quote I can come up with some topics that you have nothing to say about.

524
00:35:03,922 --> 00:35:05,998
Rym: Yep, and that is now the topic of the show.

526
00:35:14,182 --> 00:35:14,422
Scott: You can.

00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:15,868
Scott: you're gonna call it something corny cuz.

528
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:18,779
Scott: that's your corny style anyway, so I can't really stop you.

529
00:35:20,224 --> 00:35:25,530
Scott: That's the name of the episode Sure Anyway, so yeah, it's like this, you know lately.

530
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,217
Scott: There's been a lot of geekeries.

531
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:30,385
Scott: I've been doing Rims not doing well lately.

532
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:35,600
Rym: Scott decided that he hates German board games and hates video games and doesn't like to play any of them anymore.

533
00:35:36,225 --> 00:35:37,959
Scott: I just don't play him that often ever.

534
00:35:39,161 --> 00:35:40,767
Rym: When was the last German board game you played?

535
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:41,791
Scott: I was a two-time.

536
00:35:41,912 --> 00:35:42,715

00:36:11,968 --> 00:36:12,309
Rym: We're used to.

548
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:15,076
Rym: we did a panel called German board games at ConnectiCon like 2006.

549
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:19,908
Rym: Yeah So you said you could come up with topics.

550
00:36:19,948 --> 00:36:20,912
Rym: I have nothing to say about.

551
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:22,680
Scott: Oh, so I should do that.

552
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:23,533
Rym: Yeah, what's your topic?

553
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:27,034
Scott: All right Let's talk about Gundam models that you don't build and have no interest in.

554
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:28,340
Rym: I was really into models as a kid.

555
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,824
Rym: No, it's always really bad at them.

556
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:32,172
Scott: And I I'm Gundam model specifically.

557
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:32,653
Scott: Yeah.

558
00:36:33,195 --> 00:36:34,940
Scott: Do you even know anything about them?

559
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:35,783
Rym: I know.

560
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:43,458
Scott: well, so one I know there's different grades of them, you know Can you name any grade or know the difference between any of them is here's giving me the fake nerd test.

561
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:46,780
Rym: Yes But that's I can talk about the hobby.

562
00:36:47,562 --> 00:36:49,817
Scott: How can you talk about it when you don't even know the first thing about?

563
00:36:49,837 --> 00:36:51,300
Rym: well, let's see What would you say about it?

564
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,110
Rym: Cuz this is the topic that you would do a show on.

565
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:56,505
Scott: I could talk about the different grades Do it.

566
00:36:57,026 --> 00:36:58,571
Scott: Okay, so Gundam models, right?

567
00:36:58,631 --> 00:36:58,871
Scott: Yeah.

568
00:36:58,932 --> 00:37:01,860
Scott: Well, first of all, we got to start every topic the way GeekNights do.

569
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,370
Rym: No, right anecdote stuff.

570
00:37:04,116 --> 00:37:04,640
Rym: Oh my god.

571
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,176
Rym: So I actually bought a Gundam model from the second Otakon that I went to did.

572
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:12,646
Rym: Yes, and I'd sat in a box.

573
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:15,019
Rym: I never built it and then I eventually lost the box.

574
00:37:15,782 --> 00:37:16,890
Scott: So you've never built one in your life.

575
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:18,160
Rym: I've never built a cool.

576
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,857
Rym: No, I did build the Gundam model that came with a new type that Emily bought once.

577
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,667
Rym: Okay Well, I didn't.

578
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:25,069
Rym: Yes.

579
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:27,460
Rym: I started to build it and then I lost a bunch of the pieces.

580
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:43,160
Scott: Okay, so I started see Gundam models like started to try to come into the US like in the Toonami era and they had him Like the stores here for reals and they were like easy medium and hard levels and they didn't actually tell you the grades.

581
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:45,688
Scott: Ah, well, we're like these Americanized versions.

582
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:46,470
Scott: I never built them.

583
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,513
Scott: But you know who built those?

584
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:49,700
Scott: Tom Ian Harris built those.

585
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:51,644
Rym: Yeah, so did Tom.

586
00:37:51,745 --> 00:38:00,626
Scott: like the first time I ever saw anyone actually building one was like I was at Ian's house And he was and he had one that was like half-built and I was like, whoa people actually do those things whatever?

587
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:08,031
Scott: and Then it wasn't until I actually saw Gundam seed and liked it that I had any interest in actually Building or buying any of those things.

588
00:38:08,192 --> 00:38:09,680
Rym: I think of all the Gundam designs.

589
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,125
Rym: Those are actually my favorites.

590
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:15,479
Scott: Well, because when you like a Gundam show you tend to like the Gundams from that.

591
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:24,907
Rym: Yeah, but I like the style of those like the way the wingy things were on the two important Gundams toward the end Anyways, the winglings at Otakon.

592
00:38:25,148 --> 00:38:29,580
Scott: was it Otakon 02 or 03 the first Otakon after Gundam seed came out, right?

593
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:31,452
Rym: I think that was 03.

594
00:38:31,452 --> 00:38:32,640
Scott: It was early really early.

595
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:38,240
Scott: I bought the freedom Gundam model that was on sale there for like 40 bucks, which is way too much money for that model.

596
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:40,992
Scott: But that's what you're paying when you don't know better.

597
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:42,200
Scott: and it's Otakon, right?

598
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:48,520
Scott: And I built it and I built it not knowing the first clue of how to build these things.

599
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,612
Scott: And I did a bunch of stupid shit that you didn't use the paint markers.

600
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:53,480
Scott: I didn't even have the paint markers.

601
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:55,599
Rym: Did you just tore them out of those little?

602
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,165
Rym: Structures.

603
00:38:57,185 --> 00:38:58,514
Rym: so they had flash all over them right?

604
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,980
Scott: So I went to like the regular old hobby store and I bought like test stores paint or whatever like, you know.

605
00:39:04,221 --> 00:39:06,669
Scott: And I tried to make the right colors.

606
00:39:06,729 --> 00:39:11,026
Scott: and then I put I tried to use a brush and just paint it on there And it's like nope that.

607
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:18,657
Scott: and I soon as I realized that wasn't going to go Well, I stopped and I have all those paints still but I don't even they're probably dried out.

608
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:19,520
Scott: Well, they've been sealed.

609
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,400
Scott: Maybe they're not dried out.

610
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:25,700
Scott: Since then I was like not trying to paint any of these things because that does not go well.

611
00:39:27,524 --> 00:39:28,820
Scott: So they don't ask me about painting.

612
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:37,596
Scott: All I know about painting is if you want to do it easily and amazingly you need an airbrush with a compressor and you basically Mix the good paint with with.

613
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:48,135
Scott: you know Some thinner put it in the airbrush and you first you spray primer on all the pieces you put the pieces on sticks And then you spray paint the you know, the real paint on them afterwards.

614
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:52,989
Rym: So I do in fact have a very Relevant anecdote related to gonna models.

615
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,880
Rym: Do you recall you know you're talking about how they were like They're trying to push into the US.

616
00:39:57,508 --> 00:39:58,299
Rym: There was an anime store.

617
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:05,159
Rym: Oh, by the way There was an anime store that we would hang out in when we lived up in beacon years ago And then there was the ghetto one that was in the good mall.

618
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:17,388
Rym: There was a ghetto one that well It was a good one in a ghetto mall and then a ghetto one in a real mall Like it was a store that had no business being in a real mall And basically this store.

619
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:24,820
Rym: we're walking through the mall the real mall the normal mall Not the weird mall and we see a store and we're like that looks like a bunch of anime and Gundam models.

620
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:26,147
Scott: It was the fuck.

621
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:28,620
Rym: It was all bootleg crazy next to a gap or whatever.

622
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,953
Rym: So we go in there and the guy sells two things.

623
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:36,980
Rym: He sells Legit like for real Gundam models and he is super into them and knowledgeable about them.

624
00:40:37,782 --> 00:40:48,864
Scott: Too much money though, and he sold up straight up just like DVD our bootleg anime Like he downloaded from the internet put it on DVD printed DVD case Yeah, and he didn't lie about.

625
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,914
Rym: I was like, uh, this is a bootleg.

626
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:55,073
Rym: and he was like no shit Yeah, and I was like, you know, that's illegal right.

627
00:40:55,134 --> 00:40:59,849
Rym: and he was like, no one cares He was really adversarial about.

628
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:03,239
Rym: I was pointing out that everything in his store was bootleg except the Gundams.

629
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:07,456
Scott: Yep So the fact that that store exists, it's hard to bootleg gun.

630
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:08,279
Rym: Yeah, it is.

631
00:41:09,141 --> 00:41:10,728
Rym: I'm sure there's bootleg Gundams out there.

632
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:11,994
Rym: Yeah, I'm gonna look for them.

633
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:17,049
Scott: So anyway So what I ended up doing was people don't know this.

634
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:21,463
Rym: you buy Japanese Gundams bootleg Gundams for sale in the mall Whole rack of them.

635
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:22,085
Scott: Yep.

636
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:24,712
Rym: Oh, no, they look legit, but they're bootleg.

637
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:26,517
Scott: Okay, that's I'm surprised.

638
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:27,620
Scott: what factory is making this?

639
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:37,833
Rym: Wow Looks like Chinese factories are just making knockoffs all of the legit ones Mmm, I'm surprised like they don't just fall apart or whatever.

640
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:46,097
Rym: Ah The brand the brand of all of these bootlegs is Bong Lee and they sell them for about 2,300 yen.

641
00:41:48,481 --> 00:41:50,166
Scott: That's about some Gundam.

642
00:41:50,206 --> 00:41:52,293
Rym: Oh, that's the the one 100 scales.

643
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:52,855
Scott: Yeah.

644
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:54,560
Scott: Okay, so let's talk about scales, right?

645
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:01,385
Scott: So the first gun I ever bought was a freedom Gundam and I only later did I realize that is a one 100 No grade.

646
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:04,817
Scott: So no grade is pretty much just like you're the no grade hero.

647
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:06,606
Scott: Yeah, it's like just yeah It's a fucking Gundam.

648
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:06,949
Scott: build it.

649
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:08,300
Scott: It's really simple, right?

650
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:16,974
Scott: It's it's you know, and you can build any Gundam no matter how complicated with the with just the instructions Even if you read no Japanese whatsoever, it's.

651
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:18,320
Scott: it's like Lego instructions.

652
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:24,000
Scott: There is no language required like there's some Japanese characters like the decals, but you just match the symbols.

653
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,516
Scott: You don't need to know what the fuck symbol it is.

654
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:32,338
Scott: Right, you really don't need to read it all and some of them even have translations online if there's a complicated bit Which is pretty rare.

655
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:38,782
Scott: So don't be afraid to buy any you know model from any country because if it's a if it's a legit one you can do It right.

656
00:42:39,404 --> 00:42:42,112
Scott: So the no grade is like really simple.

657
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:43,536
Scott: There's like no details on it.

658
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:44,740
Scott: There's no small pieces.

659
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:47,232
Scott: It's lots of big pieces that go together really easily.

660
00:42:47,252 --> 00:42:50,568
Scott: if you just put it together You can put it together really fast.

661
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,180
Scott: it like as easy as you can put together Legos, right?

662
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,145
Scott: So the grades they have today.

663
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,957
Scott: that matter is no grade, right?

664
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:01,852
Scott: They have Hg, which is one 144. so 144 is actually smaller, right?

665
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,620
Scott: Which means if you increased its size by 144 times, it would be the same size as a Gundam in the anime.

666
00:43:11,702 --> 00:43:14,460
Scott: I don't know how they measure that but I guess they do right.

667
00:43:15,022 --> 00:43:19,915
Scott: So those are actually the ones I like more now because they're sort of tasteful like the one.

668
00:43:19,915 --> 00:43:27,676
Scott: 100 ones are kind of big and sort of garish and then they have like 1/60 which are like gigantic and ugly and really should only see that.

669
00:43:27,716 --> 00:43:30,708
Rym: now you're getting into why I Pretty much never like.

670
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:33,040
Rym: I always nominally had an interest in models.

671
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:40,334
Rym: I would make a lot of non Gundam models for much of my young life Yeah But I was never proficient enough at it for the where they would look like they weren't.

672
00:43:40,475 --> 00:43:43,340
Rym: they wouldn't look good enough to where I would display them prominently.

673
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,540
Rym: And as I'm older, I don't want to have anything I need to display prominently.

674
00:43:50,142 --> 00:43:51,526
Rym: I don't want physical goods.

675
00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:55,900
Rym: the Gundam models in New York would be a disaster as a hobby for me.

676
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,280
Scott: Yeah, the thing with Gundam models is it's like I really don't care about displaying them that much either.

677
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,380
Scott: I just sort of put them on my dresser all whatever like not trying to pose them or anything.

678
00:44:04,824 --> 00:44:06,538
Scott: It's just way fun to build them.

679
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:10,374
Scott: You know, it's like putting together Legos is the good part.

680
00:44:10,454 --> 00:44:13,448
Scott: then if you just have Legos sitting there It's like that's boring as fuck.

681
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:15,800
Scott: You want to smash them and build it again or build something else?

682
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:26,012
Rym: I think the way to really make that an interesting hobby again would be to make ultra high-quality ones and then pose them into sort Diorama and do different kinds of photography with it.

683
00:44:26,193 --> 00:44:26,434
Scott: Sure.

684
00:44:26,474 --> 00:44:26,916
Scott: You can do that.

685
00:44:26,936 --> 00:44:27,700
Scott: Yeah people do that.

686
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,640
Scott: So right, so this HG which is the smaller ones, right and they're just about as easy to build as whatever.

687
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,869
Scott: They're just small and tasteful and cheap and easy.

688
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,617
Scott: So that's that's a good place to go.

689
00:44:37,637 --> 00:44:40,664
Scott: but Then is the master grade.

690
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,312
Scott: master grade is like the fanciest right?

691
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:44,716
Scott: It's the 1/100 size.

692
00:44:44,736 --> 00:44:45,478
Scott: So it's bigger, right?

693
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,828
Scott: But everything is super detailed.

694
00:44:47,848 --> 00:44:56,800
Scott: You've got light and some of them even have crazy shit like LED lights or you know, they have like an internal skeleton and then armor on it and it gets crazy, right?

695
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:58,964
Scott: That's like the most popular one.

696
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:01,111
Scott: is the master grade whoo masters.

697
00:45:01,552 --> 00:45:04,080
Scott: then there's the perfect grade which is even crazier.

698
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:11,028
Scott: It's usually even bigger than master grade and it costs like a zillion dollars to get one of them and it comes in a ginormous box and it's just.

699
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:16,120
Scott: you know, the insanity of Gundam like Building one hand will take you all day or whatever.

700
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:23,009
Scott: I've never even bothered to even care about any of those because I'm not spending that kind of money on a model like that Ever in my whole life.

701
00:45:23,029 --> 00:45:23,753
Scott: All right.

702
00:45:24,478 --> 00:45:24,699
Rym: All right.

703
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,456
Rym: So we've proven because the show is not about Gundams that you have nothing to say about this.

704
00:45:29,677 --> 00:45:30,480
Rym: I had plenty to say.

705
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:31,942
Rym: All right.

706
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,328
Rym: Well, let the listener be the judge of that.

707
00:45:33,389 --> 00:45:43,164
Rym: Yeah, so on my side Scott claims not care about politics at all despite bringing up Lawrence Lessig's super PAC In the earlier.

708
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:47,300
Scott: there's no point in caring about anything else and as long as everything's corrupt as fuck.

709
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:56,659
Rym: No, but the one the greatest thing I can say about Bob that super PAC is that Scott here actually donated money to it.

710
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:01,272
Scott: Well, I mean the only chance we have to do anything ever.

711
00:46:01,573 --> 00:46:10,220
Rym: So so the other night I was hanging out You know online it was before bedtime and the news went apeshit or at least the news that I follow at apeshit.

712
00:46:10,722 --> 00:46:12,289
Rym: Because Eric Cantor, do you know who that is?

713
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:12,871
Scott: No clue.

714
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:14,820
Rym: He's the house majority leaders.

715
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:25,280
Rym: So he is in charge of the Republican Party in the house Isn't the Speaker of the House in charge of the house is in charge of the house But that figure the house is a Republican.

716
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:29,640
Scott: Yeah, so wouldn't the Speaker of the House who happens to be a Republican also be in charge of the Republic?

717
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,429
Rym: You don't know how political parties are structured.

718
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:34,375
Scott: Do you why do you need what is it?

719
00:46:34,395 --> 00:46:36,080
Scott: What is other person's responsibilities?

720
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:36,782
Rym: Do you know?

721
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:37,266
Rym: do you know?

722
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:39,360
Rym: what have you ever heard of the majority?

723
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:41,426
Rym: The majority or minority whip.

724
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:44,114
Scott: Yeah, that's usually why I thought that's when you're not in charge.

725
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:45,920
Rym: What is the whip do Scott?

726
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,241
Scott: So it's.

727
00:46:47,562 --> 00:46:49,369
Scott: it's like if you're the Democrats, you're not.

728
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:55,460
Scott: you don't have the house seat right now because you're not in the majority But you still need someone to sort of be in charge of your party.

729
00:46:56,685 --> 00:47:00,620
Rym: So you think the minority whip is in charge of the Democratic Party in the house?

730
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:01,701
Scott: Yeah, that's like.

731
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:07,460
Rym: you need someone to lead you and tell you know, yeah a minority leader, which is separate from the minority whip.

732
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:08,120
Scott: What?

733
00:47:09,082 --> 00:47:11,217
Rym: Yeah, so it's hard to have an opinion politics.

734
00:47:11,257 --> 00:47:11,620
Rym: You don't know.

735
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:18,763
Scott: Anyway, so he is why we should just ban political parties after we get rid of corrupt at money in politics You just get rid of parties.

736
00:47:18,984 --> 00:47:21,412
Rym: Yeah, the old there are arguments against removing.

737
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:23,900
Scott: George Washington said we shouldn't so not yes.

738
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:27,040
Rym: However, here's the argument that's usually given against removing part.

739
00:47:27,241 --> 00:47:30,739
Scott: I mean in the kind of government that we have parties will form no matter what we have.

740
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:50,180
Rym: No No They wouldn't because the reason parties are so powerful is because the electoral system supports them with by kind of defaulting in the large parties into all the national debates everything and letting them control the debates and giving them official recognition and Letting them use our voting system to do their primaries.

741
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:55,819
Rym: Imagine if the Republicans had to do their own primary on their fucking own with no help from the government at all.

742
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:09,306
Rym: That is why we have parties the way we do, but if we didn't have parties then Individual people would have to become individually popular Mm-hmm, and in that case you're all.

743
00:48:09,707 --> 00:48:20,673
Rym: the argument is that it's too easy to have a government solely of attractive people ideologues demagogues People who individually can form cults of personality around themselves.

744
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:25,232
Scott: now, there are clear problems with that But I don't see how that's much worse than what we have now.

745
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:34,720
Rym: No, I kind of like the more Slight improvement we could go to the mix-and-match party system where like you have a party that cares about these three things.

746
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,254
Rym: There's ten other parties and you form a coalition so you can form a coalition.

747
00:48:38,274 --> 00:48:44,080
Rym: That's pro-gun anti-abortion anti-religion socialism.

748
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:48,525
Scott: but That's how Israel works.

749
00:48:48,585 --> 00:48:49,067
Scott: It's not good.

750
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:52,100
Rym: That's how Europe works and right wings are coming up in there.

751
00:48:52,983 --> 00:48:58,360
Rym: Anyway, but also the Pirate Party has seen yeah, so I'm thinking enlightened despotism is really the only way forward.

752
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,443
Scott: But anyway, I got dibs.

753
00:48:59,944 --> 00:49:01,970
Rym: So Eric Cantor what like?

754
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,334
Rym: he's an important person.

755
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:10,672
Rym: He wields power within the Republican Party and He like most other Republicans was challenged from the right in his primary.

756
00:49:10,692 --> 00:49:13,200
Scott: Mm-hmm by some nutjob Tea Party person.

757
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,445
Rym: yes, I mean Mitch McConnell.

758
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:17,758
Rym: all these people, you know, their whole Republican Party is being pushed to the right.

759
00:49:17,818 --> 00:49:27,645
Rym: because Every time there's a primary now someone way to the right whoever is currently in office and currently running for the incumbency And will challenge them.

760
00:49:27,685 --> 00:49:34,835
Rym: So if the person who's already those people used to just run on some other party Yeah, so the org is not running or not exist party or something.

761
00:49:35,257 --> 00:49:42,798
Rym: So now The Republican guy might be like I'm against amnesty but for immigration reform and so for who?

762
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:43,620
Scott: in what situation?

763
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,129
Rym: Immigrants in a general sense.

764
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:46,450
Scott: Okay.

765
00:49:46,892 --> 00:49:49,060
Rym: Amnesty is just the term being used for that issue.

766
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:54,134
Rym: Okay So then the right will come in and say we shouldn't let anyone immigrate here.

767
00:49:54,535 --> 00:50:00,435
Rym: my opponent a far leftist Wants to let immigrants come in and ruin everything you mean like your grandparents.

768
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:04,592
Scott: Oh Are you a Native American Republican?

769
00:50:04,612 --> 00:50:05,719
Scott: because I don't think there's too many of those.

770
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,920
Rym: Yeah, so I guess that thing that that strategy was pretty well probably but yeah.

771
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:19,809
Rym: So these crazy Tea Party challenges within the Republican Party by and large failed and No one expected Eric Cantor to lose his name.

772
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:21,353
Scott: failed because he got a primary.

773
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,199
Scott: the only people who show up are crazies.

774
00:50:23,641 --> 00:50:25,219
Scott: So yes, he's would vote for crazies.

775
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:34,849
Rym: But the Republican money is funding the establishment Republicans because they at least are not stupid enough to think That those crazy people should actually be in office.

776
00:50:34,889 --> 00:50:41,076
Scott: but money can influence the general population in a in the real election But in a primary, it's just the crazies who show up.

777
00:50:41,136 --> 00:50:48,259
Scott: You can't really know money And especially in a non-presidential primary year like this.

778
00:50:48,601 --> 00:50:52,760
Rym: Ah, so money historically has always been enough to control the primaries.

779
00:50:53,122 --> 00:50:57,480
Rym: Upsets in primaries are pretty much unheard of in Republican land.

780
00:50:58,204 --> 00:51:00,035
Scott: How do you influence people with money in a primary?

781
00:51:00,096 --> 00:51:00,800
Scott: hardly anyone's there?

782
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,947
Rym: It's like ten people, uh, you still won.

783
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:06,540
Rym: you run ads and to you run and people are seeing those ads.

784
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:11,340
Rym: You're on ads to target people who normally wouldn't vote in those primaries and get them to join the primary.

785
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:12,752
Scott: So those ads are only on during.

786
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:13,700
Scott: the price is right early.

787
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:16,220
Rym: But anyway, I hope a whole bunch of crazy things happen.

788
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:22,980
Rym: So Eric Cantor who was the shoo-in who was expected to run he was wasn't even really campaigning much.

789
00:51:23,201 --> 00:51:26,960
Rym: He was in DC because he's just doing like National Party Republican stuff.

790
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:32,286
Rym: Mm-hmm this nobody from nowhere Ran David Bratt.

791
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:36,704
Scott: Okay, and he pretty much ran last name really brat Hard time in school.

792
00:51:36,724 --> 00:51:40,338
Rym: He pretty much ran on an anti-immigration policy and not much else.

793
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,213
Rym: He had $500,000 if that in his campaign a lot of fucking money.

794
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:46,457
Rym: That's zero money.

795
00:51:46,498 --> 00:51:47,240
Scott: five for Paul.

796
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,520
Scott: Yeah, but I mean if I had $500,000, why would I want to become a congressman when I could just live with?

797
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,903
Scott: $500,000.

798
00:51:52,903 --> 00:52:02,815
Rym: Eric Cantor spent five million dollars on the primary campaign alone because it's a corrupt government, whatever Yep, and so I don't know he quit government.

799
00:52:02,855 --> 00:52:04,080
Scott: go live with his five million dollars.

800
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,948
Scott: Oh, that's what he's gonna do in like four years.

801
00:52:06,108 --> 00:52:08,860
Rym: So basically he was or no because he lost right?

802
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,300
Rym: He's gonna act as he was acting as though he's just gonna be in office.

803
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:18,386
Rym: The entire Republican Party was acting as though he's gonna win the primary and he's gonna win the election because the district He's in is so heavily Republican.

804
00:52:18,406 --> 00:52:19,589
Rym: The Democrat has zero chance.

805
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:20,372
Scott: Where is this?

806
00:52:21,214 --> 00:52:23,080
Rym: It's the seventh district in Virginia.

807
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,049
Scott: All right, never moving there.

808
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:38,677
Rym: So it gets really interesting here because Eric Cantor helped put forth the gerrymandering that happened after the last census Fucked up as gerrymandering to make these Frankenstein districts that are so Republican.

809
00:52:38,718 --> 00:52:39,420
Rym: They're invincible.

810
00:52:40,522 --> 00:52:42,592
Rym: That's the only reason the Republicans control the house.

811
00:52:42,612 --> 00:52:52,937
Rym: you realize in the last election The Democrats won the majority of the popular vote in house elections But yet they lost the majority of the actual body because of gerrymandered districts.

812
00:52:53,177 --> 00:52:58,734
Rym: Yep So this Frankenstein district is like plus 12 to plus 15 points.

813
00:52:58,774 --> 00:53:06,380
Rym: Republican meaning by default Republicans get an extra like 12 points above a Democrat regardless of all other factors.

814
00:53:07,022 --> 00:53:15,274
Scott: It's like oh the only people who live in this district are like hicks on farms the polls that the Republicans Commissions here to track this district.

815
00:53:15,294 --> 00:53:19,152
Scott: He actually live in that area Technically nominally own a house.

816
00:53:19,172 --> 00:53:20,280
Scott: I'm like a farm somewhere.

817
00:53:20,561 --> 00:53:24,860
Rym: He lives there by all laws that require him to live there to the letter of said laws.

818
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,167
Rym: so One thing led to another.

819
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:30,580
Rym: the Republicans were polling in the district.

820
00:53:30,881 --> 00:53:33,011
Rym: They realized that Eric was gonna win by shoe in.

821
00:53:33,112 --> 00:53:34,780
Rym: so they spent proportionate amounts of money.

822
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:36,908
Rym: They were aiming mostly the general election.

823
00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:40,020
Rym: It turned out the polls were a hundred percent wrong.

824
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:50,000
Rym: Well, the aim of the general election they're guaranteed to win Because they use that election to ensure like if they don't want to mess it up for one They don't want like something crazy happen there.

825
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:55,167
Scott: But it's like if you have plus 15 points like rip Whoever the Republican is in this district will win.

826
00:53:55,628 --> 00:54:06,780
Rym: then the primary becomes more important because you in the general election They'll do spillover ads where they can use money nominally aiming at one person that's earmarked for one person.

827
00:54:07,121 --> 00:54:08,746
Rym: But they get this sort of splash effect of.

828
00:54:09,027 --> 00:54:11,615
Rym: they're also just promoting the Republican ticket as a whole.

829
00:54:11,675 --> 00:54:13,280
Rym: Republican issues in the state.

830
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:15,045
Scott: So the corruption part.

831
00:54:15,206 --> 00:54:16,309
Rym: Yeah, lots of corruption.

832
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:22,468
Rym: Yeah, so this guy came out of nowhere spent almost no money and Won by a lot.

833
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:26,439
Scott: did he just get like all his friends from like one small town in the district to show up?

834
00:54:26,782 --> 00:54:27,719
Rym: So what happened?

835
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,259
Scott: And there's only like a hundred people can tip it up.

836
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,323
Rym: So actually don't.

837
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:33,627
Rym: so blah blah blah blah blah.

838
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:37,660
Rym: the number of registered voters in the district was five hundred and twelve thousand people.

839
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:39,326
Scott: Okay, how many voted in the primary?

840
00:54:39,849 --> 00:54:42,660
Rym: The population is seven hundred and fifty thousand people.

841
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:47,435
Rym: 130,000 people voted for this upstart.

842
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,964
Scott: Whoa How does that even happen?

843
00:54:50,245 --> 00:55:02,400
Rym: Yeah, so they have open primaries meaning you don't have to be registered in a party to vote But there's no evidence that Democrats did what I tried to do in New York.

844
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,408
Scott: You know why there's no evidence of that?

845
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:12,532
Scott: because Democrats don't live there in The the weird-ass district so basically in shape so that they don't live there.

846
00:55:12,994 --> 00:55:21,160
Rym: all the tea party crazies in this Frankenstein district Saw Eric Cantor as a left-wing radical.

847
00:55:21,862 --> 00:55:28,442
Rym: they saw him as being too mainstream too liberal and they voted for nut jam and they voted for someone who speaks to their Conscience.

848
00:55:29,045 --> 00:55:39,220
Rym: and what this district proved which is kind of crazy Is that if you if a politician has a message that actually for real resonates with the people who actually?

849
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:42,419
Rym: Vote in the area that can overpower money.

850
00:55:43,213 --> 00:55:52,992
Rym: Sure That really hasn't happened in recent history and the fact that it happened Basically, the Republican Party is like a hornet's nest that just got poked with the stick.

851
00:55:53,012 --> 00:55:54,577
Scott: who was managing this dude's campaign?

852
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:55,740
Scott: like some really genius.

853
00:55:55,821 --> 00:55:57,820
Scott: You know, it's like the Robert coup of PR.

854
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:00,653
Rym: no, this guy got interviewed now and it was the Sarah Palin situation.

855
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:04,849
Rym: like he doesn't know shit about shit and No one knows anything about this guy.

856
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:07,280
Scott: How did he get his name out in that district?

857
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,039
Scott: But what what did he spend his five hundred thousand dollars on?

858
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:17,208
Rym: Oh, so he went around talking to people and going to tea party rallies and all the a.m Radio conservative like radio crazies.

859
00:56:17,228 --> 00:56:18,472
Rym: We're talking about it.

860
00:56:18,492 --> 00:56:19,295
Scott: He was just on a.m.

861
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:20,258
Scott: Radio all the time.

862
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:24,040
Rym: Yeah And FM radio and local conservative TV shows.

863
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:30,090
Scott: Why don't we lie and pretend to be crazies get people to talk to us rather than the a.m Radio and get elected and then be like up.

864
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:30,331
Scott: Sorry.

865
00:56:30,351 --> 00:56:30,933
Scott: It wasn't crazy.

866
00:56:30,973 --> 00:56:31,374
Scott: Just kidding.

867
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:32,358
Rym: It's not a bad idea.

868
00:56:32,378 --> 00:56:32,900
Scott: You can do now.

869
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:45,019
Rym: So the Republicans are going crazy because now like their whole structure is fucked and they don't know what to do about it And the Democrats are like we might win that election now.

870
00:56:48,085 --> 00:56:50,032
Scott: Well, I don't know right.

871
00:56:50,052 --> 00:56:54,650
Scott: I mean if it's if it's a Frankenstein district Yeah, and the Democrats didn't vote for the crazy.

872
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,360
Scott: Yeah, there probably aren't any Democrats there.

873
00:56:57,802 --> 00:56:59,027
Rym: So the things that could happen?

874
00:56:59,188 --> 00:57:01,055
Scott: you think that all that you think the normal Republicans.

875
00:57:01,096 --> 00:57:09,520
Scott: there will just all those 400,000 you know registered people who didn't even vote in the primary Will vote Democrat now because the Republican primary persons are crazy.

876
00:57:09,661 --> 00:57:10,846
Rym: There are a few possibilities.

877
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,820
Rym: the least likely one is that Eric Cantor will run in the general election.

878
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:15,146
Scott: Anyway, you can do that.

879
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:18,198
Rym: Hey, but by law it would have to be a write-in campaign.

880
00:57:19,822 --> 00:57:21,168
Scott: Really, I thought it's just is it?

881
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:23,480
Scott: you can't just a rule of their party.

882
00:57:24,022 --> 00:57:28,340
Rym: Uh, well for the actual election you have you can't be listed as Republican.

883
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:36,000
Scott: I mean, there's nothing in the law about political parties like that, you know You don't get either by Scott you realize and just make its own rules.

884
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,632
Rym: You realize you don't get on the ballot unless you meet certain requirements.

885
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,040
Scott: I thought it was just like signatures or whatever.

886
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:48,220
Rym: Yeah, so if you're not the Republican nominee, then you need your own way to get on the ballot.

887
00:57:48,421 --> 00:57:51,320
Scott: But the Republican Party doing it the rules of the Republican Party.

888
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,633
Scott: They can just write a rule like a bylaw and be like, yeah, you know what?

889
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:57,698
Scott: in that district primaries don't count Whatever fuck you.

890
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:02,214
Rym: If they did something like that there would probably be a legal challenge.

891
00:58:02,234 --> 00:58:08,269
Rym: saying that would only apply to the next election And more importantly the Tea Party people.

892
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,660
Rym: that would be like if Obama said I'm taking away all the white people's guns.

893
00:58:13,162 --> 00:58:17,178
Rym: the Tea Party people would probably actually pull out weapons and go crazy if that happens awesome.

894
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:25,735
Rym: and So if he runs if he runs as a write-in campaign Then basically the Republicans will split the vote and the Democrat will win.

895
00:58:25,896 --> 00:58:26,920
Rym: so he's probably not gonna do that.

896
00:58:27,282 --> 00:58:29,039
Scott: He'd rather have the crazy person than a Democrat.

897
00:58:30,262 --> 00:58:32,994
Rym: The Republicans would because this is what this is all getting down to.

898
00:58:33,015 --> 00:58:40,260
Rym: we've gotten to a point to where Local elections in places like this is just the seventh to house district of Virginia.

899
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:51,580
Rym: yeah, yet the entire nation was pumping money into this and Involved in this because all that actually matters is the number of seats your party has in the national house.

900
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:53,185
Scott: Well, there's a national Senate.

901
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:54,009
Scott: is what we had to solve.

902
00:58:54,049 --> 00:58:59,610
Scott: the election in Virginia should only be Right, at least was intended to be for Virginians.

903
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,540
Scott: and what the fuck they care about in, Virginia, right?

904
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:10,547
Scott: No What anyone else thinks who doesn't live in wherever this is in Virginia should have nothing to do with it should have no say should Have no input whatsoever.

905
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:19,865
Scott: right and back in the days before Telephones existed that's pretty much how it was because even if you were mad rich or some shit You couldn't really do anything.

906
00:59:19,885 --> 00:59:21,169
Scott: Where are you gonna send your newspapers?

907
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:21,350
Scott: to?

908
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:22,694
Scott: the middle of nowhere, Virginia?

909
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:26,244
Rym: No, I'll be the same time Do are not?

910
00:59:26,505 --> 00:59:33,640
Rym: because these are people are representing their same in the National Congress's the arguably many of the issues the u.s.

911
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:33,981
Rym: Is facing.

912
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:35,808
Rym: they are in fact national issues.

913
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:43,827
Rym: and if you're gonna if you want to influence those issues You've got to influence those, you know the house and the Senate Right, you know influence them via.

914
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:47,240
Scott: you're supposed to write on paper at least invite your votes.

915
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:55,120
Scott: Influence those issues by the person who's from where you are By voting your representative not anyone else's representative.

916
00:59:56,366 --> 00:59:57,653
Scott: Your representative represents you.

917
00:59:57,814 --> 00:59:58,900
Rym: that's covered by representative.

918
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,133
Scott: You just don't give a fuck because they're not representing you.

919
01:00:01,153 --> 01:00:02,240
Scott: give a shit what you say.

920
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:10,636
Rym: My representative represents me because I vote in those elections Yeah, and then independently I have free speech so I can just talk about other people in other places.

921
01:00:10,656 --> 01:00:19,620
Scott: I Can endorse someone in Virginia sure but you you know It wasn't intended to be that way and technology has fucked it up and made it impossible not to be that way.

922
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:21,210
Rym: How do we know it wasn't intended to be that way?

923
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:23,429
Rym: How do we if we you I'd you know I was I don't.

924
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,300
Scott: it wasn't really intended.

925
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:28,420
Scott: It was more that it was impossible for it to be any other way because it you couldn't communicate.

926
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,857
Rym: I don't think those things were intended by the founding fathers.

927
01:00:31,897 --> 01:00:33,725
Rym: founding fathers I imagine that document.

928
01:00:33,885 --> 01:00:34,267
Scott: they made it.

929
01:00:34,347 --> 01:00:36,074
Scott: they made a system under the US.

930
01:00:36,134 --> 01:00:38,543
Scott: It wasn't an intention like aha We don't want Pete.

931
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:40,209
Scott: they didn't say that or think that right.

932
01:00:40,531 --> 01:00:48,111
Scott: it was simply that they made rules that worked given the you know Reality of the world at the time in which they made the rules.

933
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:50,400
Scott: and the world has changed and the rules have not changed.

934
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:54,536
Scott: So, of course the rules are now fucked up because the world is not the same as it was.

935
01:00:54,556 --> 01:01:02,640
Rym: in whatever ah Mechanism design the rules of the game are controlled by the people who have a vested interest in how the game turns out nowadays.

936
01:01:03,644 --> 01:01:07,520
Scott: So it's like if I invent, you know, let's say like the rules of poker, right?

937
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,559
Scott: You don't don't see other people's hands.

938
01:01:09,902 --> 01:01:12,095
Scott: Well, yeah, that's gonna stop working.

939
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:17,519
Scott: the rules of poker Once I get ghost in the shell x-ray eyes suddenly, we're gonna have to change poker, aren't we?

940
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:18,702
Scott: Right.

941
01:01:19,324 --> 01:01:29,240
Scott: So we're now in a time period where everyone has fucking x-ray eyes and communicate with the people in the middle of nowhere Virginia and send them money and bribe them whatever the hell the hell else they're gonna do, right?

942
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,666
Scott: But the rule still said.

943
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:33,540
Scott: the rule was made in a time when that was not possible.

944
01:01:35,262 --> 01:01:36,410
Rym: Wow, you said a lot of words.

945
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:37,759
Rym: we're not having anything to say about this.

946
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:40,347
Scott: Yeah, but I didn't talk about.

947
01:01:40,387 --> 01:01:44,426
Scott: he's only talked about one thing which is shit is corrupt as fuck Which is the only thing that matters.

948
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:51,979
Scott: Yeah, but you keep worrying about like all these other things And I don't affect your life in any way whatsoever that you have no influence on.

949
01:01:52,741 --> 01:01:55,833
Rym: Right and I've got one who says I worry about them.

950
01:01:56,014 --> 01:01:57,400
Rym: I'm just informed about them.

951
01:01:58,243 --> 01:01:59,400
Scott: Why what does it even matter?

952
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:04,199
Scott: Well for one could fill that space in your brain with something actually useful that could change your everyday life.

953
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:09,836
Rym: If you look at the game of politics, it's an amazing game and I enjoy it.

954
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:14,660
Rym: the same way I enjoy football Like I enjoy it more than I enjoy football.

955
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:23,270
Scott: but football can affect your life anymore and you can influence football more than you can influence politics and Football can have a more immediate effect on you.

956
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:23,892
Rym: I have money.

957
01:02:23,912 --> 01:02:26,380
Rym: I can influence politics more than I can influence football.

958
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,307
Scott: I can influence football a lot by going to the stadium and yelling.

959
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:35,124
Scott: I Football.

960
01:02:35,244 --> 01:02:38,399

01:02:38,419 --> 01:02:40,450
