1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,106
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 21st, 2014.

2
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:10,468
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,200
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,529
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:16,960
Rym: Tonight, Sailor Moon.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,579
Rym: Because Scott had actually never seen any of it until now.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,397
Scott: I saw some.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,598
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,010
Rym: Also known as Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,410
Scott: I meant you should have said that instead of any of the other stuff you said.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,650
Rym: Instead of what other stuff?

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,250
Scott: You should have just said tonight, Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,329
Rym: Oh, you're still mad about me doing long openers?

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:37,684
Rym: Yes.

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,849
Rym: You're still mad about that?

16
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:41,730
Scott: Are you trying to make up for the openers you're not doing because you're in Europe?

17
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:49,290
Rym: They've got to be just long enough to make it through the pre-canned opening scroll that I got in the audio.

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,390
Scott: You know, you can use a smaller can, right?

19
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:54,470
Scott: If you only get so many beans, put them in a half-size tin.

20
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,581
Rym: No, double tin.

21
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:56,149
Rym: Double it up.

22
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:01,127
Rym: I should release a DVD of just GeekNights openers.

23
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:06,289
Scott: Do whatever you're going to do.

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,113
Rym: So yeah, there's a limited time for this, but if you're an anime fan, which I assume you are, why else would you listen to?

25
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:18,289
Rym: GeekNights Wednesdays, which was once the easiest GeekNights to do, is now increasingly the second most...

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,330
Scott: I've watched a ton of animes.

27
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,270
Scott: Which one would you like to talk about that you haven't watched?

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,909
Rym: Here's the trouble.

29
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,643
Rym: How many animes have we collectively watched?

30
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:27,130
Rym: if we reviewed all of them?

31
00:01:27,832 --> 00:01:28,629
Rym: That'd get us a month.

32
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,170
Rym: Two months of shows.

33
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:32,669
Scott: We only do like two anime shows a month at most.

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,100
Rym: Yep.

35
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:37,650
Scott: You gotta watch like one or two anime a month to make GeekNights happen.

36
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,329
Rym: Yep, but we gotta watch enough to properly review them.

37
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:41,487
Scott: It's enough.

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:51,270
Rym: But anyway, if you're an anime fan at all, you know that other than pretty much Kill La Kill and Madoka Magica, the last great anime was Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex.

39
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,648
Rym: I have since second gig and...

40
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,530
Scott: Not counting movies.

41
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,750
Rym: Yeah, not counting movies.

42
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,630
Rym: Pretty much all I've wanted out of anime.

43
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,790
Rym: Though Kill La Kill kept me going.

44
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:08,490
Rym: And though Madoka kept me going, and there were other good shows along the way, I pretty much just want more Ghost in the Shell.

45
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:12,170
Rym: So, as you know, there is more Ghost in the Shell.

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,199
Rym: It's not done yet.

47
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,210
Rym: Arise is still ongoing.

48
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,410
Rym: It's kind of a prequel, a little bit of style change.

49
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:21,570
Scott: It's one of those OAV kind of things, like Gundam UC, where I was planning to wait for it to all be done and then watch it.

50
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,114
Scott: But you know what?

51
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:24,070
Scott: Well, Gundam UC is done now, so I'm gonna watch it.

52
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:29,230
Rym: But there are also... We have conflicting policies of watch any anime that's in a theater in New York.

53
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:32,470
Scott: Right, so Arise is gonna be in a theater in New York.

54
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:43,630
Rym: Borders 1 and 2 are being screened in New York, Atlanta, Cambridge, Baltimore, Alexandria, and like 12 other cities on May 29th, which is next Thursday.

55
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,161
Scott: It's using this weird system where enough people have to want to go in order for it to happen.

56
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:52,350
Rym: It's like Kickstarter just for a movie screening.

57
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,590
Scott: So it's like in some of the cities, not enough people signed up for it, so it's not gonna get screened.

58
00:02:56,751 --> 00:03:01,330
Rym: Yeah, so if you want to see this, the deadline is in days.

59
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,730
Scott: I wonder if we can use this and get things we want to watch in the movie theater.

60
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:06,775
Rym: Huh.

61
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,570
Rym: Attack the gas station.

62
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,262
Scott: Exactly.

63
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:11,070
Scott: Something like that.

64
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,490
Rym: I think I could get a couple hundred people to come and watch that.

65
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,050
Rym: I don't know if I ever want to watch Ebola Syndrome again.

66
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:20,230
Scott: I don't either, but if I put it on the website, maybe other people will subject themselves to it by accident.

67
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,170
Rym: I wonder if it's just on YouTube or something.

68
00:03:22,373 --> 00:03:22,949
Scott: Oh my god.

69
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:23,888
Rym: I can believe that.

70
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:32,489
Rym: Ebola Syndrome might literally be the most abhorrent piece of fiction I've ever watched or consumed in any way beginning to end.

71
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,579
Scott: That is 100% correct.

72
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,529
Rym: The only reason that is true.

73
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,370
Scott: I can't even begin to think of anything, not even shit like Apocalypse Zero.

74
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,650
Rym: Apocalypse Zero is basically a children's anime compared to Ebola Syndrome.

75
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:46,130
Rym: That's right.

76
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:46,491
Rym: E.G.

77
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,729
Rym: the Killer is a romp through the park.

78
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:52,230
Rym: Oh, Ebola Syndrome.

79
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,750
Rym: But the only reason it's the most important thing I've ever seen all the way through is because I did walk out of Martin Short's Clifford.

80
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,230
Rym: So yes, go buy tickets to this.

81
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,957
Rym: If you go to the one in New York, well, we're going.

82
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,450
Rym: We'll be there.

83
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,489
Rym: You can say hi.

84
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,110
Scott: I imagine the same people I see at every- If you're tall, don't sit in front of me.

85
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:17,050
Rym: Every screen of anime we ever go to in New York City, we see the same people at every time.

86
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,870
Rym: I imagine those people will all be there.

87
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:22,128
Rym: If you want to join Anime New York, go to the screening.

88
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:24,289
Rym: Everyone in line is going to be awesome.

89
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,870
Scott: Alright, in other news, the show that we're going to talk about in our main bit, Sailor Moon, is back.

90
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,230
Scott: Now we all knew there was going to be a new Sailor Moon series, Sailor Moon Crystal, something, something, whatever, right?

91
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:45,190
Scott: And people have been waiting for it and it's been delayed and teased and all kinds of- Not just delayed, but delayed with no information, no art, no trailers, nothing.

92
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:48,887
Scott: Suddenly, probably the biggest news in U.S.

93
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:53,330
Scott: anime, you know, period, has happened, right?

94
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:00,126
Scott: Sailor Moon, the whole thing, I don't know anything about movies, but all the TV serieses, right?

95
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:11,910
Scott: Are being subbed, and new dubbed, and released, uncut in the original Japanese form, on the internet, and DVD, and buray.

96
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,442
Rym: Original, uncropped, 4x3.

97
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,350
Scott: In order, nothing missing, starting already.

98
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:23,710
Rym: I like how this website I'm looking at makes a special point to say, yes, that includes Sailor Stars.

99
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,710
Scott: Yep, everything, the whole deal.

100
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,770
Scott: It's like, it's happening.

101
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,730
Rym: No, it's interesting, because this is more the news bit.

102
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:36,850
Rym: There is a small, but not trivial, backlash against this.

103
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,247
Scott: Well, it's the same as like, right?

104
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,409
Scott: So, most people who are like Sailor Moon are like, I mean, I'm excited about this.

105
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,929
Rym: Sailor Moon is a pretty fucking important anime, both in Japan and the United States.

106
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,845
Scott: Yeah, I mean, people, you know, like in the United States, it's like because it was on TV, right?

107
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,809
Scott: That's the reason it's a big deal.

108
00:05:57,011 --> 00:06:02,623
Scott: But you think, oh, is it one of those shows, like in Japan, no one gives a shit about Sailor Moon, and in the U.S.

109
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:05,109
Scott: it was a big deal, just because it was the only one that made it on TV.

110
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,370
Rym: Yeah, it introduced the concept of a magical girl to most of the non-Japan world.

111
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:22,490
Scott: Right, but in Japan, it's like, wait a minute, if this show wasn't a big deal in Japan, like, say, Cowboy Bebop isn't that big a deal in Japan, why are there like four different seasons with 200-something episodes?

112
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:24,450
Scott: Oh, because it was a big deal in Japan.

113
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:24,851
Rym: Yep.

114
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,230
Rym: In fact, it was a big deal around the world.

115
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,269
Rym: Sailor Moon is one of those iconic, recognizable characters where everyone knows what it is.

116
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,910
Scott: Yep, it's like Hokuto no Ken big worldwide, right?

117
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:36,492
Rym: -Yep.

118
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:37,929
Scott: -So, this is a big deal.

119
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:44,570
Scott: So, if you didn't watch Sailor Moon back in the day, now is the Sailor Moon time.

120
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:46,469
Scott: It is the revival of Sailor Moons.

121
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,249
Scott: So, we're doing a Sailor Moon show.

122
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:58,069
Rym: Yep, but what is interesting is that I was previously going to say probably not worth watching all of the old Sailor Moon, because I've watched all of it.

123
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,141
Scott: -Why not watch all of it?

124
00:06:59,162 --> 00:06:59,789
Rym: -Multiple times.

125
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:04,188
Rym: Now I'm older and I have a lot more free time to watch these long--.

126
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:06,904
Rym: When I was younger, I couldn't really deal with a lot of--.

127
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,449
Rym: Ah, but I fly around a lot.

128
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,290
Rym: Do you know how many movies I've watched in the last two weeks?

129
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,305
Scott: The way I view it, right, is.

130
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,949
Scott: it looks like they're going to be putting out more-- releasing episodes in order every Monday, right?

131
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:28,130
Scott: So, basically, it's like if I just have nothing the fuck to do, and I can't go outside, and I can not at work, and it's just like I got 20 minutes with nothing, Sailor Moon.

132
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,696
Rym: -You know what?

133
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:30,850
Scott: -And eventually I'll see it all.

134
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,050
Rym: Having just watched the first two episodes again, it's kind of worth watching.

135
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,235
Scott: -Anyway.

136
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,229
Rym: -It's actually a pretty good show.

137
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:39,026
Scott: For what it is.

138
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:48,990
Scott: But yeah, all the Sailor Moon that was beneath the surface has now risen to the top, like a giant mountain above all other animes.

139
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,110
Rym: I guess that means I don't need to dig out my VCR to be able to watch my Vkill fansubs.

140
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,269
Scott: No, we can sell all that shit.

141
00:07:56,051 --> 00:08:08,110
Rym: Actually, I was looking around to find some info to see if the guy who did those was still around, and I found a number of people who are desperate to buy them, not to watch, but just to have as collector's items.

142
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,670
Scott: All right, sell it off, make some money.

143
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,850
Rym: Because this guy was pretty fucking serious about it.

144
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,800
Rym: -Back in the day...

145
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,430
Scott: -Make some dough.

146
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,570
Rym: Because it's not really relevant to the show itself.

147
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,809
Rym: I guess I'll tell this story now.

148
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:21,228
Rym: As you guys know, I've been watching anime for pretty much literally my entire life.

149
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:25,170
Rym: Since I was a little kid, my mom made me watch Vampire Under D. Anime, anime, anime.

150
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:32,450
Rym: So by the time Sailor Moon was on American TV, and I was watching it, I was already old hat into anime.

151
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:37,710
Rym: High school was when Cartoon Network had their big rebirth, because they brought out Sailor Moon R.

152
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,289
Scott: I could see Sailor Moon in middle school because it was syndicated on the broadcast.

153
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,330
Rym: It was, but that was only the first season.

154
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:44,350
Rym: Of course, heavily edited.

155
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:48,510
Rym: And then Sailor Moon R, the next one, has two halves.

156
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,790
Rym: These Alan and Anne, aliens in a tree from space do their thing.

157
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,510
Rym: And then there's the second half.

158
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,130
Rym: that's all Prince Diamond and those assholes.

159
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:04,690
Rym: They only ever aired the first half on Cartoon Network when, at least originally, when they were like, "Hey, we got more Sailor Moon.

160
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,690
Rym: You can watch more than just what you saw as a kid.

161
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:06,974
Rym: Oh my

162
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:07,379
Rym: gosh.".

163
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:09,549
Rym: But even then, anime was old hat.

164
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,990
Rym: So I knew at that point about anime.

165
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:13,585
Rym: I knew information.

166
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,589
Rym: I knew there were clubs out there.

167
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,730
Rym: I knew there were fan subs.

168
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:20,170
Rym: And I had some friends who were also really into Sailor Moon.

169
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,381
Rym: I really wanted to see.

170
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:26,049
Rym: what I heard was the crazy crap that happens later.

171
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,268
Rym: And I knew a decent bit about it.

172
00:09:28,873 --> 00:09:31,390
Rym: So I did the thing that you did back in the day.

173
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,610
Rym: Bought a bunch of really high-quality VHS tapes.

174
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:36,910
Rym: And I mailed them to a guy along with a check.

175
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:41,410
Rym: And he mailed me back really nice clam shells.

176
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:49,669
Rym: Like big, heavy, thick white clam shells with laser-printed, full-color, high-resolution images from the laser discs on them.

177
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:52,070
Rym: These things were way high production values.

178
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,448
Rym: Every - I keep saying "thinking disc".

179
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,529
Rym: - Every VHS tape had its own edge label and its own side label.

180
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,110
Rym: Again, printed high quality.

181
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:02,510
Rym: All of Sailor Moon.

182
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:03,586
Rym: Every bit of it.

183
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:04,775
Scott: - With subtitles.

184
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:05,970
Rym: - Yes, with subtitles.

185
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,594
Rym: - Good subtitles.

186
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:13,429
Rym: - Mastered with his fucking genlock machine from the laser disc masters that he had and the translation he did himself.

187
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,729
Rym: Vkill seems to have been kind of a legend among Sailor Moon fans.

188
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:21,249
Scott: That guy had so little to do that he sat there and made those tapes for you.

189
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:22,970
Scott: And how many other people?

190
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,649
Rym: Apparently a lot of people.

191
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,890
Scott: That guy was just sitting there making tapes all day.

192
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,108
Rym: That was what anime fandom was.

193
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,130
Scott: How many VCRs the fuck did that guy have?

194
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:36,190
Rym: That is what anime conventions were until, what, the year 2001?

195
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,265
Scott: But anyway, there's some people in the community, right, who were like, "Ah, this is

196
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:41,729
Scott: awful!".

197
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:49,410
Scott: Because they are like Robotech people, where they - it's like, you know, a lot of those shows that were originally brought to the US were fucked the fuck up.

198
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,990
Scott: Like, Robotech, they changed everyone's name and combined three shows into one.

199
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,949
Scott: And Sailor Moon, they changed people's names and cut shit out, right?

200
00:10:56,511 --> 00:11:00,650
Scott: And some people, it's like their nostalgia is for that edited American crappy version.

201
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:03,370
Scott: And they don't like the original version.

202
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:05,089
Scott: They're like, "No, you're ruining it.

203
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,942
Scott: Her name is not Usagi.

204
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:07,889
Rym: Ah, ah,

205
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:07,949
Rym: ah.".

206
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:19,909
Rym: These people will refer to - her name's not, you know, we're not gonna - they shouldn't be using the other name, which we won't actually write out in English characters because that disrespects the ancient power of the Japanese language.

207
00:11:20,452 --> 00:11:25,328
Rym: It's not - Usagi is just our rough interpretation of that word.

208
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,010
Rym: Weaboos amaze me to a degree that sometimes surprises me.

209
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:31,118
Scott: It's hilarious.

210
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,907
Scott: That's all there is to it.

211
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:32,488
Rym: Yes.

212
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,848
Rym: But little known fact, that guy, he subbed a couple other things.

213
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:38,150
Scott: Evangelion?

214
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,330
Rym: He subbed End of Evangelion, which I watched without having seen Evangelion, not even knowing it was related.

215
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:49,270
Rym: And he subbed, I think, the Tokimeki Memorial, like, OAV special?

216
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:50,222
Scott: It had anime?

217
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,050
Scott: I thought it was just an SNES game at first.

218
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,190
Rym: Was it Tokimeki or was it - no, it was Two Heart.

219
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,710
Rym: It was one of those dating shows, whatever.

220
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,549
Scott: Two Heart came way later, digital subs.

221
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,989
Scott: That was one of the early digital ones.

222
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:06,649
Rym: Yeah, but he did one of those dating game type things, had a show, and he did it as part of everything else he did.

223
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:13,089
Rym: And since I was getting all of Sailor Moon, I just got everything he'd ever fan-subed, which was Sailor Moon plus those handful of other things.

224
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,810
Rym: But first, things of the day.

225
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:27,326
Rym: So, you guys know we're really into Counter-Strike, and while we're old - I haven't played Counter-Strike in a long time.

226
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,423
Rym: I don't know why not.

227
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,109
Rym: Counter-Strike is great right now.

228
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,090
Scott: I'm busy.

229
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:31,524
Rym: Busy doing what?

230
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,501
Rym: You can play some Counter-Strike.

231
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:33,842
Rym: Doing other shit.

232
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,200
Rym: What games are you playing lately?

233
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,821
Scott: Uh, video games?

234
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,590
Rym: Yeah, what video games are you playing?

235
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:38,894
Scott: None.

236
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:39,845
Scott: None video games.

237
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,367
Rym: You should play some video games.

238
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,667
Rym: We've had some - so, GeekNights actually has an official Counter-Strike server, and you know what?

239
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,275
Scott: It's still up?

240
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,210
Scott: People still go there?

241
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,970
Scott: People have been playing there.

242
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,330
Rym: Really?

243
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,810
Scott: In fact, we just had - Listeners or just random internet people?

244
00:12:50,892 --> 00:12:51,390
Rym: Uh, listeners.

245
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:51,941
Scott: Really?

246
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,290
Rym: We had - it's all talk.

247
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,870
Rym: It's set up for our use.

248
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,930
Rym: It's an awesome server.

249
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:58,769
Rym: So, we've been playing a bunch of Counter-Strike there, and it's super fun.

250
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:01,050
Rym: It's amazing how it's the air hockey problem.

251
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,270
Rym: I'm way better than pretty much most of the listeners.

252
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,328
Scott: I'm probably garbage now.

253
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:05,870
Rym: You were always garbage.

254
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,650
Scott: I was not always garbage.

255
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:07,949
Rym: You were never that good at Counter-Strike.

256
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,050
Rym: I'm not gonna lie.

257
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,598
Scott: I was that good, just how that - You were okay.

258
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,525
Scott: I was good at a point.

259
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,523
Rym: You were good when the P90 was OP.

260
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,010
Scott: There were also times, right?

261
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:23,070
Scott: I wouldn't be consistently good, but I would have one in five matches.

262
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,130
Scott: Moment of greatness.

263
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,346
Rym: There would be that moment where you just randomly flip around and click, and then you headshot a guy across the map, and you're like, "I'm gonna do

264
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:29,449
Rym: that.".

265
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,463
Scott: That happens a couple times, but also, there would be days where I'm really good today.

266
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:39,090
Scott: Or when we were at PAX Prime, and I think we played with Conrad, and I was mowing everyone down with a parrot.

267
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:40,990
Scott: I think there was something about that mouse.

268
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,710
Scott: The sensitivity was just right.

269
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,849
Rym: That's why you buy a really good mouse.

270
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:44,970
Scott: I have a really good mouse.

271
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,509
Scott: For some reason, I don't know what sensitivity they had that one set on.

272
00:13:47,872 --> 00:13:53,650
Rym: So we talk a lot about head-clicking and about games of skill, and we're just talking about mouse, and how the mouse is so important to Counter-Strike.

273
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,790
Rym: So this gentleman killed you with a wheel.

274
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:07,270
Rym: He puts up a video where he ends the debate between what is better for Counter-Strike, a gamepad or a mouse and keyboard, by using a wheel.

275
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,401
Rym: And the opening of the video was so great, because he goes into the console while music is building up to it, and he types, "Joystick

276
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:14,751
Rym: 1.".

277
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:14,897
Rym: Uh-oh.

278
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:20,290
Rym: And then his only goal is to not be in last place.

279
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,750
Rym: This is amazing to behold.

280
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,048
Rym: They even have their own song.

281
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:25,385
Scott: ♪ Killed you with a wheel.

282
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:26,219
Rym: ♪ ♪ Killed you with a wheel.

283
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:28,346
Rym: ♪ ♪ Headshot with the wheel.

284
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:28,852
Scott: ♪.

285
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,229
Scott: You kind of need to get a headshot with the wheel.

286
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:35,409
Scott: The biggest problem with the wheel is you can't go up and down, so if a guy's far away or too close, you can't get him.

287
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:35,719
Scott: Yep.

288
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,070
Scott: But if he's just right, oh, watch out.

289
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,690
Rym: But you're watching, like, trying to hit some people, and it's just almost painful to watch, but because there's a wheel there, it's great.

290
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:53,070
Scott: All right, so Florida Man, notorious for drugs, disorderly public conduct, and many other bad behaviors.

291
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,710
Rym: There's a reason FARC has a tag for only one state.

292
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:05,968
Scott: Yeah, you might wonder -- and there's a Twitter account, Florida Man -- you might be wondering, "What does Florida Man do when he's not either making meth and exploding it and killing

293
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:06,310
Scott: himself?"

294
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,310
Scott: Or consuming meth.

295
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:08,187
Scott: Or using meth.

296
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,906
Scott: Or bath salts or whatever.

297
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:11,249
Scott: have you.

298
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,128
Rym: Bath meth.

299
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:18,010
Scott: You'd probably go scuba diving because Florida's kind of warm and nice, and if you're in the water, you're far away from the other Florida people.

300
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,290
Rym: Yeah, I think that's why people swim in Florida.

301
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:35,429
Scott: Right, but of course, because so many Florida Men just die and float out to sea, it attracts certain dangerous animals that this Florida Man had to contend with in this pretty good video, which looks like it was shot with a GoPro, so watch it.

302
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,935
Rym: It's pretty good.

303
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:39,850
Rym: Florida Man succeeds.

304
00:15:40,393 --> 00:15:43,689
Scott: They should have this Florida Man take out all the other Florida Men.

305
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:46,189
Rym: Well, he's got that spear gun.

306
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:49,130
Scott: A few million enter, one man leaves.

307
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,190
Rym: In the meantime, the Book Club book is A Canticle for Leibowitz.

308
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,008
Scott: I started reading it.

309
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:54,709
Rym: I will read it soon.

310
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,779
Scott: It's got Jews in it.

311
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,497
Rym: Oh, oh, oh.

312
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,102
Rym: You think?

313
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:04,770
Scott: You don't see Jews in the sci-fi too often as a nerdy Jew.

314
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:05,849
Scott: I like that.

315
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,909
Rym: You know, that is kind of true.

316
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,710
Rym: There are a couple of characters that exhibit some of the stereotypes that you're thinking of right now, Scad, in the culture books.

317
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,368
Rym: You don't say?

318
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,427
Rym: Nah, a few.

319
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:19,390
Rym: But, yeah, not many sci-fi characters named Leibowitz.

320
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:21,249
Rym: All this one.

321
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,466
Scott: You don't say?

322
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:25,542
Rym: Our forum's awesome.

323
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:26,350
Rym: YouTube's awesome.

324
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:29,050
Rym: Lots of videos coming soon.

325
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,630
Rym: I'm not going to Hong Kong next week.

326
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,709
Rym: I wheedled my way out of it, so I'm going to try to edit up the GeekNights Presents Utena.

327
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,329
Rym: We've got two more episodes to upload.

328
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:42,149
Scott: If you ever do go to Hong Kong, I should give you a list of electronic things to acquire and bring back.

329
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,270
Rym: I'm going to come back with a suitcase full of all the things.

330
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,110
Rym: You know how many HDMI splitters, DRM removers?

331
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,010
Scott: I'm talking about bigger things than that.

332
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,710
Scott: You can get camera lenses and all that kind of shit.

333
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,109
Scott: Stuff that's more expensive, but it's still cheaper there and often available there, but not available here.

334
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,509
Rym: Things that I legally have to pay a duty on if I bring back into the United States.

335
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:06,849
Scott: Also, bootleg things, right?

336
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,884
Scott: I was watching some photo videos online.

337
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,390
Rym: They can confiscate your bootlegs at the border.

338
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,109
Scott: Whatever, but it's like these guys, they're in Hong Kong, right?

339
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,730
Scott: They're like, "Okay, here's a camera challenge.

340
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,640
Scott: Take pictures using this flash,".

341
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,852
Scott: and it's the Fuke 960.

342
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:26,008
Scott: No, it was the Fuke 690, that's what it was.

343
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:28,930
Scott: F-U-Q 690.

344
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:34,367
Scott: It was just some cheap flash that you can get on the street in Hong Kong, and it's like, "That's so cheap,

345
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:34,609
Scott: though.".

346
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,609
Scott: If I had three of those, instead of one really good one...

347
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,690
Rym: Instead of one good camera, I'd buy 12 terrible cameras.

348
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:46,164
Scott: But the guy did amazing shit with those flashes, because they work, right?

349
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:50,650
Scott: And it's cheaper than getting real ones, right?

350
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:50,980
Scott: No.

351
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:51,659
Scott: Anyway.

352
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:53,389
Scott: Sailor Moon.

353
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:56,050
Scott: Oh, we're already talking about Sailor Moon?

354
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,289
Scott: We're not talking about conventions you should go to?

355
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,619
Rym: You should go to ConnectiCon.

356
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,049
Rym: It's the next big convention we're going to.

357
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,370
Scott: Keep pressing F5 while you're listening to this podcast.

358
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,649
Rym: Penny Arcade Expo badges will go on sale, I'm pretty sure.

359
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,962
Rym: My guess is tomorrow.

360
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,570
Scott: We're on orange alert right now for PAX Prime tickets.

361
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,586
Rym: My guess is tomorrow, Thursday, May 22nd.

362
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,850
Scott: Probably today for most of us.

363
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,490
Rym: My second guess is Monday.

364
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,650
Scott: Yeah, they wouldn't fuck us on Friday.

365
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:33,510
Rym: Well, the website went down today for a minute, and for a second I thought, maybe I shouldn't tell anyone but my close friends.

366
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,240
Scott: Everyone in the world knows.

367
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,690
Scott: There's no secret keeping here.

368
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,350
Rym: There's a Reddit thread longer than any thread in the GeekNights forums within seconds of that going down.

369
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,029
Scott: That's right.

370
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,649
Rym: You're pretty much fucked if you want to go to PAX.

371
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:53,590
Scott: And to think, his award, a lot of people, their method of finding out is they've got a notification on the official PAX account, so whenever it tweets, they get a mobile notification.

372
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,970
Rym: Yeah, you're going to get a notification if the badges are sold out.

373
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,569
Scott: That shit is delayed one to three minutes, yo.

374
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,410
Scott: In that time, you're going to be locked out.

375
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,340
Rym: You might get a Monday and a Sunday badge.

376
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,230
Scott: If you're super lucky, you might get the four one days.

377
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,070
Rym: But you're definitely not going to be staying in the Sheraton or the Red Line.

378
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,767
Scott: Hell no.

379
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,788
Rym: What was that fucking hotel we stayed in?

380
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:16,369
Rym: PAX dev was like here.

381
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,610
Scott: The serviceable, but kind of annoyingly far away hotel.

382
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,690
Rym: Well, the thing is, say PAX is in the middle.

383
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,690
Rym: This hotel was way away to the right.

384
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,388
Scott: Listen, just stay in an airport hotel and use the light rail every day.

385
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,310
Rym: Yeah, you know, random aside, I stayed in an airport hotel for the first time in my life last week, like a hotel in the airport.

386
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:34,801
Scott: In the airport?

387
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:35,770
Scott: Not just next to it?

388
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:39,830
Scott: I stayed in hotels next to an airport, but never in an airport.

389
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,150
Rym: So directly connected.

390
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,370
Scott: As in you could walk from the hotel to your gate?

391
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:43,909
Rym: Yes.

392
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:45,150
Scott: Without going outside?

393
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:46,570
Rym: I did not have to go outside.

394
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:47,050
Rym: Okay.

395
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:48,410
Rym: I did have to go through security though.

396
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:49,410
Scott: Alright, that's obvious.

397
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:54,390
Rym: Yeah, there appeared to be a way to do security in the hotel if I was first class flying, but I was not.

398
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:56,410
Scott: And they just drive you to the plane?

399
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:02,170
Rym: Yeah, I think they had a personal concierge who will take care of you and do personal security, but I digress.

400
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:04,269
Rym: So, Sailor Moon.

401
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:07,350
Rym: Scott knows almost nothing about it.

402
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,590
Scott: Okay, so I watched more than zero Sailor Moon in my life, right?

403
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,489
Scott: I watched when it was on the TV.

404
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:25,170
Scott: I watched a few episodes, but mostly it would be on like right before the show I actually wanted to watch, which was Bot's Master, or it would be on like after something I wanted to watch like Voltron, when it was like Cartoon Network.

405
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,269
Scott: So it's like it was never on at a time when I was going to watch it.

406
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,210
Scott: So I watched it like a few times.

407
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:35,050
Scott: And I know that there's a girl, she turns into Sailor Moon.

408
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,030
Scott: It's really stereotypical magical girl.

409
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,643
Scott: There's a bad guy, monster of the week.

410
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:39,329
Scott: She fights it.

411
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:42,169
Scott: She does some makeup thing and transforms.

412
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:47,790
Scott: There's a tuxedo guy who's obviously that dude and that's her boyfriend.

413
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:49,808
Rym: No, why would you say that?

414
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:59,030
Scott: There's other sailors who are different colors for different planets, and the plot just gets bigger and bigger and bigger, and then there's lesbians and then it's over.

415
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:04,690
Rym: What I do enjoy is how you make a lot of guesses about the show, like from the first two episodes.

416
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:06,010
Scott: I'm mostly right because it's so stereotypical.

417
00:21:06,151 --> 00:21:09,050
Rym: You're mostly like completely wrong, which is really funny.

418
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,350
Scott: How could you be so wrong about something so cliche?

419
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,010
Rym: Well, you're like Sailor V. That's Sailor Venus.

420
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,150
Rym: So there's already Sailor Scouts.

421
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,581
Rym: No, she's not a Sailor Scout.

422
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:19,440
Rym: She's just Sailor V. She's the underwear pervert.

423
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,509
Rym: She's not a Sailor Scout yet.

424
00:21:21,472 --> 00:21:21,810
Scott: Oh, yet.

425
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,310
Rym: And yeah, she doesn't come in until way later anyway.

426
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:25,858
Scott: Okay.

427
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,290
Scott: But she's going to be Sailor Venus later.

428
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:27,832
Rym: Yup.

429
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:30,250
Rym: You thought that Naru's mom was Queen Beryl?

430
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,949
Scott: Well, you know, they made it look like it.

431
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:33,510
Scott: Different hair!

432
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:39,530
Rym: You can only tell some of these characters apart, I realize, in retrospect, because their hair is slightly different.

433
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,910
Scott: Oh, they had that dude who works at the arcade who looks just like Jedi.

434
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:44,048
Rym: Jedi-t.

435
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:45,110
Scott: Jedi, sorry.

436
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,024
Rym: Jedi-t is...

437
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:46,545
Scott: Yoda.

438
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,956
Rym: Is miltoast.

439
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,050
Rym: He's like Green Beryl's first general.

440
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:55,070
Rym: His primary trait is being nondescript and boring and then getting admiraled.

441
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,990
Scott: Yeah, that whole Queen Beryl thing reminds me a lot of Voltron, right?

442
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,170
Scott: Because in Voltron, you've got what, Zardoz?

443
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,168
Scott: No, it's not Zardoz.

444
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:02,783
Scott: Zardoz.

445
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,410
Scott: What the fuck is that dude's name?

446
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,270
Scott: I don't remember.

447
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,467
Scott: It definitely has a Z.

448
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:07,750
Rym: I'm going to admit to you, Scott.

449
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,390
Rym: I watched Voltron, but I did not like Voltron.

450
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,090
Scott: Voltron's good.

451
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:12,567
Rym: As a kid.

452
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:14,309
Rym: But I had the Voltron board game.

453
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,469
Rym: Are you looking it up?

454
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,467
Scott: Oh, is it Zoltan?

455
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,969
Rym: Zoltan doesn't sound right either.

456
00:22:20,971 --> 00:22:21,245
Scott: Zoltan?

457
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:22,929
Scott: It was something like that.

458
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:23,829
Rym: Regardless.

459
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,263
Scott: But yeah, it was like him, right?

460
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,725
Scott: And then there was Zarkon, right?

461
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,646
Scott: Okay, so here we go.

462
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:33,830
Scott: Thank you, Wikipedia.

463
00:22:34,714 --> 00:22:35,710
Scott: So it's King Zarkon.

464
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,450
Scott: He's like the real bad guy, right?

465
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:40,050
Scott: Then there was his son, Prince Lotor.

466
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:43,770
Scott: He was like the second in command kind of bad guy, right?

467
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:53,570
Scott: And then there was the sort of person on the side who would summon all of the row beasts that Voltron would fight, right?

468
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:56,990
Scott: So, you know, the Sailor Moon setup is really similar, right?

469
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,750
Scott: Like Queen Beryl's at the top, and then there's the henchman Jedi, whatever.

470
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:05,830
Scott: And then he summons the monster of the week that Sailor Moon actually has to fight.

471
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:11,850
Scott: And she doesn't actually fight the top bad guys, just like Voltron doesn't, you know, ever fight, you know, Prince Lotor or whatever.

472
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:13,110
Scott: Anyway.

473
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:13,546
Rym: Yeah.

474
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,309
Rym: But yeah, Nephrite, or not Nephrite, that's still Jedi.

475
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:18,550
Rym: We didn't get to all the much better ones yet.

476
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,269
Scott: They all have 'ite?

477
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:19,990
Rym: Yeah.

478
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,049
Rym: Look, you see the theme going, right?

479
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,350
Rym: Jedi, zoisite, malachite.

480
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,688
Scott: Well, I guess it's- Oh, they're all gems.

481
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,286
Scott: They're all gems.

482
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:28,668
Scott: Not gems.

483
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:29,950
Scott: Stones.

484
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,089
Rym: Okay.

485
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,029
Rym: I guess someone wasn't in Science Olympiad as a kid.

486
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:44,210
Rym: But you might remember zoisite is the one who in the American dub, they made him a girl to just kind of remove this whole homosexual relationship that was going on.

487
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,170
Scott: Oh, it's an androgynous person?

488
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:53,448
Scott: And he- Well, you could freaking go to, you know, Messenger Z with the- Oh my god, yeah.

489
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,870
Rym: But that wouldn't have been on American TV either.

490
00:23:57,472 --> 00:24:00,730
Rym: But it's interesting, you know, I watched all of Sailor Moon twice.

491
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:01,505
Rym: All of it.

492
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:07,130
Rym: But most of the first like 10 or 15 episodes- Of Baron Asher, right?

493
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:14,290
Rym: I saw, dubbed in the English release, and I never bothered rewatching them in Japanese.

494
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,269
Scott: Even though you had all the tapes?

495
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:16,990
Rym: I didn't have tapes of season one.

496
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:17,808
Scott: Oh, really?

497
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,290
Scott: You only had those Vkills for all the other Sailor Moon?

498
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:25,010
Rym: I had R, S, Super, S, Stars, Amichan no Hatsukoi, and the three movies.

499
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:39,023
Scott: Oh, you know, when I was watching the trailer, right, they made a trailer for the rerelease, and the trailer only mentioned Sailor Moon, S, Super, S, and Stars, and R. It didn't mention anything about- The movies.

500
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,130
Scott: The movies or that other thing you just said.

501
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,490
Rym: Amy's first love.

502
00:24:43,031 --> 00:24:48,408
Rym: It's a side story about Sailor Mercury, and she falls in love with this hacker boy who's dating someone else.

503
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:49,450
Rym: Okay.

504
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:50,849
Rym: And then she comes to team.

505
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,470
Scott: So I'm really curious if like the movies and everything's gonna be included in there or not.

506
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:07,950
Rym: I'm also curious, the movies are, in fact, they're so stereotypical of anime series movies that if we ever do our all-anime or the same panel, we have to add all three Sailor Moon movies to it to buff it out.

507
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,390
Scott: Maybe some of those Tenchi movies also.

508
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:09,939
Rym: Yeah.

509
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:12,029
Rym: Well, kind of.

510
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,090
Rym: Yeah, the Tenchi movies do, but these movies occur on islands.

511
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,249
Rym: They bring in side characters who then die.

512
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:18,930
Rym: Like, it's pretty much straightforward.

513
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,788
Rym: I think Sailor Moon dies in all of them too.

514
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:30,690
Scott: But anyway, so since I was in middle school or high school, whatever, we watched the first two re-released episodes of Sailor Moon in their uncut, subtitled version on the moon.

515
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:39,350
Rym: Now, episode two is notable because it was never even aired on American TV because it showcased too much juvenile delinquency and panty shots and Satanism.

516
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,690
Scott: Yeah, so you never saw it before.

517
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:41,750
Rym: Never saw that episode.

518
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,890
Scott: Okay, so let's just talk about Sailor Moon.

519
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:53,970
Scott: So first of all, this show has a lot, you know, it's weird in that right from the beginning, you have all these magical girl show tropes, cliches, hardcore, right?

520
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:55,669
Scott: Running out of the house late for school.

521
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,650
Scott: She didn't have toast in her mouth, but she might as well would have, right?

522
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:02,190
Scott: Helping pet friend transformations.

523
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:05,430
Rym: Say moon tiara, whatever, make up, magic go.

524
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,510
Scott: Magical attacks, everything, right?

525
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:08,990
Scott: The whole bag, right?

526
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:27,510
Scott: But unlike, say, modern shows, everything sort of moe, creepy pervy or cutesy kitty, it's a lot more wacky, comedy, gag manga style, like Ursa Yatsura or kotocha or any of the other, you know, gag mangas of that era, right?

527
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:28,309
Scott: Or even earlier.

528
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:32,370
Rym: So, and it's actually honestly, it's pretty funny at times.

529
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,169
Rym: Like I forgot how funny this show can be.

530
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:42,890
Scott: So in that way, it's sort of, you know, unique in that it's sort of combining the magical girl and the gag, you know, genres together.

531
00:26:43,332 --> 00:26:48,986
Scott: But it also has some funniness to break up the tedium of the formula fighting the monster of the week.

532
00:26:49,430 --> 00:27:04,570
Rym: Though I realize something that's interesting is that Scott's opinions of this, having only kind of seen the beginning of Sailor Moon and episodes from season one and none of the later stuff, the show is way more Green Lantern-y and superhero-y later on than is obvious from the beginning.

533
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:07,850
Rym: And the manga is just Green Lantern with girls.

534
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:08,869
Scott: Even from the beginning?

535
00:27:09,174 --> 00:27:09,609
Rym: Oh my God.

536
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:10,229
Rym: The manga?

537
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:15,249
Rym: I haven't even read all the manga, but from what I've read of the manga, it is, it is the Green Lantern.

538
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:16,027
Rym: Okay.

539
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,030
Rym: It is all just space politics and battles and it's crazy.

540
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,109
Rym: Kind of want to read the manga actually.

541
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:22,668
Rym: Go for it.

542
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,329
Rym: I've been thinking for a while to get it all and just try to read it.

543
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:27,769
Rym: I used to read it in Borders books.

544
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:30,189
Rym: Or no, no, no, Walden books.

545
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:36,990
Scott: So the first thing you notice when you watch Sailor Moon is that Usagi is dumb as a brick.

546
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:39,810
Rym: Yeah, Usagi is pretty fucking dumb actually.

547
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,050
Rym: And, uh, spoilers, she never gets smarter.

548
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,870
Scott: Even at the end where it's all Green Lantern-y?

549
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:58,590
Rym: Uh, she pretty much, as far as I can tell, Scott made an observation that I never thought of much having, you know, just cause I've, I've seen the show a lot more, closer to it, so it's easy for me to kind of gloss over these things.

550
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,410
Rym: Scott, you describe Usagi or Sailor Moon as almost being a weapon wielded by others.

551
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:06,030
Scott: Yeah, she doesn't do anything.

552
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:07,628
Scott: It's just like the cat tells her what to do.

553
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,468
Scott: Tuxedo guy tells her what to do.

554
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,808
Scott: She just, she doesn't actually attack the bad guys or do anything of her own volition cause she's so dumb.

555
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,288
Scott: It's, other people just make her do it.

556
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,250
Scott: And it's, she has all this power, but she has no, you know, will whatsoever.

557
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,269
Scott: Her primary power seems to be- She just stands there while the bad guys are coming at her.

558
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,429
Rym: Then she cries.

559
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,650
Scott: One guy throws a rose once and that somehow stops all the lower henchmen.

560
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,790
Scott: Cause he's way powerful.

561
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:38,030
Scott: Yeah, and then it's just like, throw the tiara, hello.

562
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,670
Rym: Welcome to the trope.

563
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,370
Scott: She doesn't even transform on her own.

564
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,749
Scott: It's just, hey, transform now.

565
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:44,823
Rym: Do I have to?

566
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,830
Scott: Say these exact words.

567
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:47,963
Scott: What were the words again?

568
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:48,470
Rym: I forgot.

569
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,150
Rym: I got 30% on my English test.

570
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,670
Rym: Let me tell you what, her grades only go down as the show goes on.

571
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,070
Scott: How could you go down, how could she not get kicked out of school or held back?

572
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:57,229
Rym: I have no idea.

573
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,270
Scott: Maybe that's why, I mean, how long, she's in eighth grade now, right?

574
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:00,610
Scott: Yup.

575
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:02,070
Scott: So she's almost in high school.

576
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:06,129
Rym: She will make it to high school in Sailor Stars.

577
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,695
Scott: She actually makes it.

578
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:09,910
Scott: So that means she has to pass the classes, right?

579
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:10,890
Scott: In middle school.

580
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:12,068
Rym: Uh, I guess.

581
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,369
Rym: She's, you know, she's pretty dumb.

582
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:19,810
Rym: But she, as far as I can remember, she doesn't do much of her own volition.

583
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:20,773
Rym: Like really?

584
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:26,190
Rym: Like there's a moment in Stars where she is finally like, you know what, I'm going to do this thing.

585
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:28,309
Rym: And then she does it and everyone else is like, no, don't do that.

586
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,730
Rym: It's kind of like when Monica's mom is like, you should do something that's the wrong thing.

587
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,689
Rym: And she's like, fuck yes.

588
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,770
Rym: And she throws something somewhere and then all shit breaks loose.

589
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:42,029
Rym: Sailor Moon has a scene like that, but it takes all the way until Stars to get to it.

590
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:52,550
Rym: But, uh, I don't know, the show, I kind of want to watch the entire thing again because it has been about 14 or 15 years since I watched Sailor Moon.

591
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,828
Scott: It'll be 14, 15 years before you see it all again.

592
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:56,504
Scott: It's 200 episodes.

593
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:04,109
Rym: Kind of amazed how much I actually do remember, but most of what I remember is from S and Stars and Super S is just...

594
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:05,162
Scott: What's the order?

595
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:05,709
Scott: so people know?

596
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,790
Scott: Obviously you watch Sailor Moon first.

597
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,766
Rym: Sailor Moon, the first...

598
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,389
Scott: When you watch Sailor Moon, how many seasons does that have?

599
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,810
Rym: Uh, so one season was what was available.

600
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:15,507
Rym: Okay.

601
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:20,210
Rym: Sailor Moon, 26 episodes and that's just the whole Queen Beryl arc.

602
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,710
Rym: And you learn, and by the end of that, you learn the backstory that she's the reincarnation of the Queen from the previous era.

603
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:28,750
Rym: In a sense, Sailor Moon is a post-apocalyptic story.

604
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,930
Rym: This is a world that was rebuilt after an apocalypse.

605
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,009
Scott: But I mean, if you just watch Sailor Moon on its own, it's a complete story with an end and you can stop?

606
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,490
Scott: Yes.

607
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,970
Scott: Okay, so each one of them is a complete story?

608
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,777
Rym: Pretty much, yes.

609
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:43,570
Rym: Each one is a stand-alone story.

610
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,850
Scott: But obviously you need to watch the previous one to understand the next one?

611
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:46,529
Scott: Not really.

612
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:46,994
Scott: Really?

613
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:52,489
Scott: You can just watch Sailor... Like, if I just started today and all the episodes were out and I watched Super S, I would know what's going on?

614
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:56,268
Rym: You wouldn't know who most of the characters were, but it wouldn't really matter that much.

615
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:02,250
Scott: But there wouldn't be any loose ends from the previous one or loose ends hanging at the end?

616
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,750
Rym: So, interestingly, after Sailor Moon, which the end of that is...

617
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:08,210
Scott: It's only 26 episodes, Sailor Moon?

618
00:31:08,312 --> 00:31:08,488
Scott: Yeah.

619
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:13,110
Rym: The end of the first season of Sailor Moon is actually one of the high points of the show.

620
00:31:14,153 --> 00:31:15,042
Rym: It's a really good ending.

621
00:31:15,486 --> 00:31:15,950
Rym: Not gonna lie.

622
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,330
Scott: Well, I imagine they kill Queen Beryl's as dead, right?

623
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:19,150
Scott: It's complicated.

624
00:31:19,592 --> 00:31:19,682
Scott: Okay.

625
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,490
Rym: Sailor Moon R is the next Sailor Moon.

626
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,510
Rym: Sailor Moon R has two story arcs.

627
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,669
Rym: There's Alan and Anne.

628
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,059
Rym: I've watched that in English.

629
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,269
Rym: I didn't have fansubs of that shit.

630
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:32,869
Rym: If I did, I actually didn't watch them, I don't think.

631
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,550
Rym: But they're just some aliens coming down in a tree and they're trying to steal people's energy.

632
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:39,829
Scott: Oh, so the arcs are based on the big bad guy?

633
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,789
Rym: Yes, whoever the big bad guy is, is the arc.

634
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:51,710
Rym: And then the next half of that is... ...is Prince Diamond and all these sort of other royals come down and they have their business going on and they resolve that.

635
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:53,390
Scott: Why is everyone messing with Earth?

636
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,210
Scott: Aren't there a zillion other planets they can mess with?

637
00:31:56,753 --> 00:31:58,230
Rym: You'll find out later why that's the case.

638
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:58,600
Scott: Okay.

639
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:01,369
Scott: They didn't rebuild after their apocalypses?

640
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:07,270
Rym: Sailor Moon S is when, in my opinion, shit got good because that is the crazy apocalypse.

641
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:09,681
Rym: The Holy Grail is out there.

642
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,130
Scott: There's these aliens trying to come in.

643
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,169
Scott: The same one Jesus had?

644
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:13,190
Rym: Maybe.

645
00:32:13,778 --> 00:32:13,969
Scott: Maybe?

646
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,289
Scott: So Sailor Moon has to go and get the cup that Jesus drank from.

647
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:21,610
Scott: Was Jesus like Sailor Desert or something?

648
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,538
Rym: I'll put it this way.

649
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:33,210
Rym: There are multiple... You know some of the scenes in Kill La Kill where they're experimenting on babies and/or trying to make clothes in a lab?

650
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:39,075
Rym: Some of those scenes are cribbed shot for shot from scenes in Sailor Moon S. Sailor Moon.

651
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:40,890
Rym: S is some of my favorite Sailor Moon.

652
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,989
Rym: That's the dark stuff, the weird stuff.

653
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:45,629
Scott: So why was it called R and then S?

654
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,570
Rym: Fuck if I know.

655
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:46,869
Scott: Okay.

656
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:48,750
Rym: If I knew at any point, I have forgotten.

657
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,891
Scott: As opposed to Sailor Moon 2 or 3.

658
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:52,530
Rym: S is also a complete story.

659
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:59,450
Rym: S is a high body count and S is when you get introduced to the outer Senshi, the Sailor Scouts from the outer planets.

660
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,050
Scott: They're still introducing characters way late.

661
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:02,503
Rym: Yes.

662
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,410
Rym: Dude, Sailor Moon is by herself for a good chunk of the first season.

663
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,110
Rym: Then she gets Sailor Mercury and Sailor Mars kind of early.

664
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,685
Scott: But it's like they're in the opener, right?

665
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,830
Scott: In the first opener of the first episode, you see these other Sailors, right?

666
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,749
Scott: And you see Sailor V before you even see Sailor Moon in the show.

667
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,351
Rym: Yep.

668
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:23,570
Rym: She basically awakens them as time goes on in the early parts of the show.

669
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:26,750
Rym: Then they find Sailor Jupiter and she's this badass punching girl.

670
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:27,549
Scott: Yeah, punching.

671
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:28,178
Rym: Yep.

672
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:33,609
Rym: Sailor Venus is already awakened because there's another cat that found her.

673
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:37,007
Rym: And he is like, "Yo, you're powerful,

674
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:37,350
Rym: whatever.".

675
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,130
Rym: So she's an underwear pervert in her own regard.

676
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:41,990
Rym: And then she becomes, she realizes she's a Sailor Scout and all that stuff.

677
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:43,029
Rym: But that's the inner Senshi.

678
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:46,890
Rym: They're responsible for internal bullshit within the solar system.

679
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:51,870
Scott: So in this universe, is our solar system the center of the universe?

680
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,371
Rym: No.

681
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:55,790
Rym: There are other solar systems that have their own sets of Sailors.

682
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,630
Scott: So why is Sailor Moon so much more important than any of those other people in the other solar system?

683
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:01,768
Rym: Who says she is?

684
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:05,050
Scott: I think she obviously is because the show's named after her.

685
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:09,310
Rym: If we're watching a cop show that's set in Baltimore, that doesn't mean that there aren't cops in France.

686
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:13,389
Scott: Sure, but this show goes into the outer space parts.

687
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,135
Rym: Yeah, so here's the deal.

688
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:18,250
Rym: The inner Senshi are responsible, they're like the FBI of the galaxy.

689
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,483
Rym: The outer Senshi are like the CIA.

690
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,616
Scott: How come there's no Sailor Moon?

691
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:29,030
Scott: How come there's no Sailor Io or Sailor Titan or Sailor Europa?

692
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:30,947
Rym: I don't know.

693
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:31,956
Rym: Huh.

694
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:34,074
Rym: Some of that might be dealt with.

695
00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:39,850
Rym: There are characters that have names from those other moons and things.

696
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,545
Scott: Also, clearly their astronomy was all fucked up because there is a Sailor Pluto, right?

697
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:44,230
Scott: But there shouldn't be.

698
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:48,949
Rym: Well, Sailor Pluto's weird that she can't really interact much because of her power.

699
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,190
Scott: And what's the other thing that's out there next to Pluto?

700
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:52,886
Rym: Oh, Charon?

701
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,449
Scott: Yeah, how come there's no Sailor Charon?

702
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,599
Rym: Well, Sailor Saturn is the most powerful one.

703
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,750
Rym: Her power has basically destroyed the entire universe.

704
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,318
Scott: Well, rings.

705
00:34:59,604 --> 00:34:59,870
Scott: Duh.

706
00:35:01,214 --> 00:35:02,000
Rym: Well, Saturn.

707
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:03,229
Rym: Chronos and all that.

708
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:03,948
Scott: Rings.

709
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,510
Rym: Yeah, not really rings is why.

710
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,250
Scott: Well, wouldn't Jupiter be stronger with that badass fucking storm?

711
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,170
Rym: Yeah, but she just punches people.

712
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,490
Scott: Well, if you're that big, you usually only need to punch people.

713
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:16,750
Rym: So, what's funny is in Sailor Moon S...

714
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,130
Scott: Don't play an ace when in due school.

715
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:20,885
Rym: Like, you get used to these Sailor Scouts, like this team of five.

716
00:35:20,905 --> 00:35:21,650
Rym: They're like the thing.

717
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,698
Rym: And then you meet the outer Senshi and they're a little bit older.

718
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:28,450
Rym: They're like later middle school, early high school.

719
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,669
Scott: But they're still just people on Earth?

720
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:31,331
Rym: Yes.

721
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:38,208
Rym: They, however, drive cars, act like adults, and they're so much more powerful than the inner Senshi.

722
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:38,930
Rym: It's almost a joke.

723
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,530
Scott: I don't know what can be more powerful than, like, Tiara Action, you're dead.

724
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,347
Rym: Yeah, so they...

725
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,424
Scott: What if she accidentally shoots Tiara Action, like, at the ground?

726
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:49,270
Scott: Will the Earth disintegrate?

727
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:51,621
Rym: I think it only works on living things.

728
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:53,270
Scott: I don't really remember.

729
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,270
Scott: Like, would it disintegrate an elephant?

730
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,336
Rym: Doesn't work on everyone.

731
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:56,624
Rym: Like, she has to upgrade over time.

732
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:57,610
Rym: She gets constant upgrades.

733
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,290
Rym: Super S is all about her daughter from the future.

734
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:02,609
Scott: Okay.

735
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,450
Rym: Comes back to learn things.

736
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,930
Scott: And you're a middle school girl, and here's your daughter from the future.

737
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:13,289
Rym: Yeah, so in Stars, a younger person comes from the future, and for a while they're like, "Well, is that her

738
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:13,630
Rym: daughter?".

739
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,610
Rym: Granddaughter from the future.

740
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,730
Rym: What the fuck's going on in the future?

741
00:36:18,353 --> 00:36:21,701
Scott: Why would people coming from the future... I mean, clearly people are coming from the future.

742
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,828
Scott: The future's doing pretty good, right?

743
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,040
Scott: So why are they coming back to the past?

744
00:36:25,181 --> 00:36:26,810
Scott: You should go with them back to the future.

745
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:29,970
Rym: Well, because then you aren't there to save the past.

746
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:30,893
Scott: Fuck the past.

747
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:31,899
Scott: The future's all good.

748
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:32,885
Scott: People are coming from there.

749
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:33,770
Scott: They have time machines.

750
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,449
Rym: Because you're still there as soon as you leave.

751
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,849
Rym: It's like the Bravest Warriors, where he tries to go back in time and fix things.

752
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:45,769
Rym: And he's like, "If this is a bad idea, I would obviously come back here and destroy this machine right

753
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:46,070
Rym: before.".

754
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,189
Rym: And then he comes back and destroys it right in front of himself.

755
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:50,548
Scott: That is that.

756
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,489
Scott: That's why Bravest Warriors is so good.

757
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:53,890
Rym: Oh, Bravest Warriors.

758
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,528
Rym: Bravest Warriors.

759
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,290
Rym: I like that show about as much as I like Pokemon Rusty.

760
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:00,590
Rym: Sailor Moon.

761
00:37:01,295 --> 00:37:03,090
Rym: Did you watch the new episode of Pokemon Rusty?

762
00:37:04,797 --> 00:37:07,430
Scott: How different is Sailor Moon, really, from Pokemon Rusty?

763
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:15,910
Scott: The only difference between Sailor Moon and Pokemon Rusty that I can see is that Rusty fails and Sailor Moon succeeds somehow.

764
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:17,690
Scott: That's the only difference, right?

765
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:22,850
Scott: If Pokemon Rusty actually managed to beat Team Rocket and catch Pokemon and whatnot, he would just be Sailor Moon.

766
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:24,377
Scott: You know what?

767
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:24,539
Rym: Yeah.

768
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,389
Rym: You know what?

769
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,750
Rym: Interesting commentary going on here.

770
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,848
Scott: Rusty is just as dumb.

771
00:37:29,972 --> 00:37:35,810
Rym: Watching the show in this early episode and seeing all this school stuff, that's really not there in later episodes.

772
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,857
Scott: Well, that's most anime.

773
00:37:36,877 --> 00:37:38,350
Scott: Start with the school and it goes away, right?

774
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:41,930
Scott: Well, Full Metal Panic has a school that goes away.

775
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:43,910
Scott: Naruto has a school that goes away.

776
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,450
Scott: I think Yuu Hakusho has a school that goes away.

777
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:47,408
Rym: That is true.

778
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,550
Rym: Koto-chan has a school that doesn't go away.

779
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:50,152
Scott: That's true.

780
00:37:50,513 --> 00:37:56,490
Scott: I like, and the thing is, school stuff, it's like so many mangas start in school, right?

781
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:01,050
Scott: And then they break away from it to go to some sort of formula of battling or who knows what.

782
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,610
Scott: But they start with school because school stuff is so good.

783
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:10,549
Scott: It's just really hard as a writer to keep writing school stuff where you keep it fresh constantly.

784
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,790
Rym: Well, you should watch Shinsekai Yori from the New World because they're in school.

785
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:15,870
Scott: The whole time?

786
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:17,650
Rym: Well, then they're adults, but they're in college.

787
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:20,078
Rym: You should watch that show.

788
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,210
Rym: That gives you interesting ways to use school.

789
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:29,150
Scott: Right, but I'm talking about concentrating on the Japanese middle or high school and staying in it.

790
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,670
Scott: The only kind of shows that can really manage that are stuff like Azumanga Daioh.

791
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,178
Rym: Why don't they make a shounen fighting show?

792
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,150
Rym: that's about getting good grades in school?

793
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:37,017
Scott: They did.

794
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:37,890
Scott: It's called Cromartie.

795
00:38:40,372 --> 00:38:44,810
Rym: So anyway, Sailor Moon Super S is all about her daughter.

796
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:47,769
Scott: Sailor Moon RS Super S.

797
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:51,050
Rym: And it's her daughter falls in love with a unicorn boy.

798
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:53,149
Scott: Wait, unicorn boy?

799
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:53,582
Rym: Yeah.

800
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,038
Scott: Does he transform?

801
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:56,510
Scott: Or is he always a unicorn?

802
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,607
Rym: He can be a boy too.

803
00:38:58,092 --> 00:38:58,180
Scott: Okay.

804
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,598
Rym: And that's kind of, it's important and standalone.

805
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:05,790
Rym: I think it gets more treatment in the manga, but it's kind of cute.

806
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:07,170
Rym: I really like the closing theme.

807
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,287
Scott: Wait, where are the unicorns from?

808
00:39:09,393 --> 00:39:10,550
Rym: Space bullshit, I don't remember.

809
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,670
Scott: Is this planet with unicorns?

810
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,430
Rym: It's all Green Lantern space bullshit.

811
00:39:13,795 --> 00:39:13,883
Scott: Okay.

812
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:14,671
Rym: So,

813
00:39:15,294 --> 00:39:15,938
Rym: S.T.A.R.S.,

814
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:18,191
Rym: the last season, up through episode 200.

815
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:19,269
Scott: Oh, that's the last one?

816
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,050
Scott: Because I saw that in the trailer and it looked like Macross 7.

817
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,291
Scott: Yeah.

818
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:24,114
Rym: S.T.A.R.S.

819
00:39:24,174 --> 00:39:28,850
Rym: is the one where there's dudes who, they transform into Sailor Scouts, so they just become women.

820
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:29,590
Rym: Okay.

821
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,272
Rym: When they transform.

822
00:39:30,312 --> 00:39:36,570
Rym: And they are as more powerful than the outer-senshi, than the outer-senshi are, than the inner-senshi.

823
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:37,309
Rym: They're just like gods.

824
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,730
Scott: So the Macross 7 people are the most powerful?

825
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:40,403
Rym: They're the most powerful Sailor Scouts.

826
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:41,190
Rym: They're badasses.

827
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,637
Scott: Wait, but that thing that's all.

828
00:39:42,658 --> 00:39:44,650
Scott: Macross 70 is the end of the whole thing?

829
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:45,025
Scott: Yes.

830
00:39:45,898 --> 00:39:46,408
Scott: What the fuck?

831
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:51,830
Rym: So, everything up through Super S is kind of constrained to this galaxy.

832
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:56,390
Rym: So, it's like our bullshit and our solar system within the greater galaxy doesn't really matter.

833
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:59,490
Rym: It's just that our solar system has all these problems and we're dealing with them.

834
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,925
Rym: There's an external threat from elsewhere in the galaxy.

835
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:02,590
Rym: We fight it off.

836
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:03,794
Rym: S.T.A.R.S.

837
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,530
Rym: is about the galactic crisis where...

838
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,930
Scott: That's why you need the gods to help you?

839
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,309
Rym: Yeah, there's a bigger Sailor than...

840
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,690
Scott: So how does Sailor Moon even contribute when there's these god guys taking care of it?

841
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,490
Rym: So, like I said, there's a point where she kind of, like her powers work, but she's really not contributing.

842
00:40:17,011 --> 00:40:18,397
Rym: And there's a moment in S.T.A.R.S.

843
00:40:18,437 --> 00:40:19,502
Rym: where she's like, "Fuck this.

844
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:20,506
Rym: I'm doing the

845
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:20,788
Rym: thing.".

846
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:22,929
Rym: And she does the thing and it's a thing.

847
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,349
Scott: But she has a thing to do?

848
00:40:24,531 --> 00:40:35,090
Rym: She actually actively does a thing despite, you know... She demonstrates volition and forethought in a way that is rarely seen in her character up until that point.

849
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:36,910
Rym: Okay.

850
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:45,290
Rym: Yeah, but it's interesting to watch the show and see, like, these middle school hijinks and, like, her stereotypical anime friends, Wakaba and Creepy Dude.

851
00:40:47,173 --> 00:40:49,090
Scott: Or, well, we could actually just call Wakaba Naru.

852
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,889
Rym: Yeah, but she's a Wakaba.

853
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:51,524
Scott: Yeah.

854
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:53,451
Rym: Wakaba 100%.

855
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:59,450
Rym: In fact, Wakaba in ways that are surprisingly apt in terms of things that happen to her later.

856
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,669
Rym: In terms of her not being special in any way.

857
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,870
Rym: Kendall Hill Wakaba is not in the 10 Universe.

858
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,189
Scott: But still being a character in the show that matters in the show.

859
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:13,810
Rym: And she matters in the plot, but she's not special in whatever magical way that the special people are special.

860
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,670
Scott: She's not Sailor anything.

861
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:15,861
Rym: Yeah, she's not a duelist.

862
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:16,610
Rym: She's not a Sailor.

863
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:18,457
Rym: As I recall in S.T.A.R.S.

864
00:41:18,598 --> 00:41:23,310
Rym: and even in S, you kind of learn that people who aren't Sailors, their souls just fucking disappear when they die.

865
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,158
Rym: Like, they got nothing.

866
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:25,210
Rym: They don't get reincarnated.

867
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,830
Rym: Only Sailors get reincarnated because they have real souls.

868
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,070
Scott: Oh, so then Sailor Moon could just, like, get killed in a fight and it wouldn't matter.

869
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,689
Scott: She'd come right back.

870
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,753
Rym: That's the greater plot.

871
00:41:32,814 --> 00:41:38,670
Rym: Sailor Moon is the reincarnation of the princess from the previous world that was destroyed in an apocalypse.

872
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:39,569
Scott: Okay.

873
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,355
Rym: So anyway, S.T.A.R.S.

874
00:41:41,837 --> 00:41:47,370
Rym: is the galactic crisis where there's kind of, like, the head Sailor who is taking over the entire galaxy and she's evil.

875
00:41:48,112 --> 00:41:50,150
Scott: And Sailor Moon in this... Oh, there's an evil Sailor?

876
00:41:50,515 --> 00:41:51,265
Rym: Yeah, there's...

877
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:57,790
Scott: Why does the... I mean, if this is such a universal thing, what does the universe know about sailing, which is a really Earth-centric concept?

878
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,762
Rym: That word means something special.

879
00:42:00,782 --> 00:42:02,940
Rym: That word's the equivalent of... It's like a kryptonite.

880
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:03,609
Rym: It's a proper noun.

881
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,670
Scott: Uh-huh, but they're wearing clothes that resemble sailing.

882
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:15,930
Rym: Yeah, I guess humans got their sailing tradition from... Well, I put out the Sailor, the galactic Sailors from far away, the Starlights.

883
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:17,337
Rym: They don't wear that shit.

884
00:42:17,357 --> 00:42:19,310
Rym: They just wear, like, these black leather outfits.

885
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:20,790
Scott: Sexy sailing.

886
00:42:21,595 --> 00:42:22,310
Rym: They're the sexiest.

887
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,087
Scott: In the Navy.

888
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:26,550
Rym: They also have the best opening theme ever.

889
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,150
Scott: Well, if it's all Macross 7 style, they better, right?

890
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:29,551
Scott: Yeah.

891
00:42:29,812 --> 00:42:33,310
Rym: No, every time they're about to appear, you hear this snapping.

892
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:34,790
Scott: Oh, that's so badass.

893
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:38,204
Rym: And then someone starts whistling and then they appear.

894
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:39,190
Rym: They're the best.

895
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,769
Scott: If we snap and whistle, will they show up?

896
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:41,467
Rym: I don't know.

897
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,255
Rym: I think I remember.

898
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:43,558
Rym: It's like...

899
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:48,253
Scott: Oh, someone's coming!

900
00:42:48,273 --> 00:42:48,660
Scott: Someone's coming!

901
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:54,600
Scott: Oh, it's just Proto Man.

902
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:54,920
Scott: Never mind.

903
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:59,820
Rym: So, again, people are going to correct me, I'm sure, because I've gone over 15-year-old memories.

904
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,880
Rym: Their names were Taiki, Yaten, and I forgot the third guy.

905
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:06,738
Scott: Not Taiko?

906
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,158
Rym: No, I think it's Taiki.

907
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:15,219
Rym: Yaten is the one I definitely remember, because I think there's... Oh, I remember... It might be a translation error.

908
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,838
Scott: Are they named after nebulas or some shit?

909
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:20,940
Scott: I remember seeing a weird... Oh, they're named after stars because they're stars?

910
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:25,320
Rym: Well, one of their powers is a cosmic uterus thing, so...

911
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:26,260
Scott: Is there one named Soul?

912
00:44:26,682 --> 00:44:26,770
Rym: No.

913
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:27,686
Scott: Huh.

914
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:36,560
Rym: So, anyway, I recall a weird, possibly implied romance between Luna and Yaten.

915
00:44:37,461 --> 00:44:38,220
Scott: The cat and the rocks?

916
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,879
Rym: That sailor, Starlight, the one with the gray hair.

917
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:42,199
Scott: Okay.

918
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:47,040
Rym: I remember thinking I saw that happening.

919
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:47,558
Rym: Cat sex?

920
00:44:47,862 --> 00:44:51,833
Rym: And then I mentioned it to another friend of mine who was like, "Yeah, I always kind of thought that

921
00:44:51,874 --> 00:44:51,934
Rym: too.".

922
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:56,495
Rym: And then he showed me even other scenes where like, "Oh, there was something going on between those

923
00:44:56,536 --> 00:44:56,657
Rym: two.".

924
00:44:57,302 --> 00:44:59,720
Rym: Even though she's supposed to be dating Artemis, the white cat.

925
00:45:00,623 --> 00:45:00,855
Scott: Okay.

926
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:03,459
Scott: Well, I mean, it would be hard to date anything that's not a cat.

927
00:45:03,603 --> 00:45:04,080
Rym: Yeah, they would.

928
00:45:04,362 --> 00:45:04,620
Scott: You're a cat.

929
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:07,020
Scott: You're not transforming like the unicorn.

930
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,139
Rym: She dates the unicorn, and right now he's still a unicorn right there.

931
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,144
Scott: Oh.

932
00:45:12,062 --> 00:45:12,107
Scott: Oh.

933
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:12,976
Scott: Okay, then.

934
00:45:13,685 --> 00:45:14,260
Rym: That's fine.

935
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,840
Scott: Everyone's getting freaky, and Sailor Moon's just clueless.

936
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:29,177
Rym: But yeah, the stars is like, now the galaxy's having this crisis, and Sailor Moon is just like the one power from this one region that's still holding out, and they have to fight back, and it's

937
00:45:29,197 --> 00:45:31,740
Scott: this whole- Oh, because they did such a good job of defending their solar system.

938
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,978
Rym: They're like the only place where- They're the only place- Yeah, they're like the only place left unconquered.

939
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:44,780
Scott: So they end up, by virtue of the fact that they didn't suck in their small local battles, they become like the home base for the galactic battle?

940
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,618
Rym: The galactic resistance basically lands there.

941
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,120
Scott: It's not because they're actually any more special than anyone else.

942
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,980
Scott: It's just they happen to be in a good location.

943
00:45:51,544 --> 00:45:51,796
Scott: Oh, okay.

944
00:45:53,482 --> 00:46:00,080
Rym: The other things I really remember that specifically, Haruka and Michiru are the best characters in the entire show.

945
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:01,140
Scott: I don't even know who those people are.

946
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,280
Rym: They're Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus.

947
00:46:04,582 --> 00:46:04,840
Scott: Okay.

948
00:46:05,001 --> 00:46:06,339
Scott: I know Sailor Uranus from Salty Bet.

949
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:06,992
Scott: Yeah.

950
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,019
Scott: Bet on her usually.

951
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,100
Rym: Yeah, you know what, Uranus, everyone has their token item.

952
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:10,740
Scott: Oh, I bet Uranus, almost.

953
00:46:11,223 --> 00:46:13,579
Rym: Uranus carries a sword, an actual sword.

954
00:46:13,782 --> 00:46:14,259
Scott: Cutting people?

955
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:14,587
Scott: Yeah.

956
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:22,140
Rym: And Neptune is, for my high school eyes watching this show- The hottest?

957
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,580
Rym: The hottest character I'd ever seen in anime other than Unipuma from Tank Police.

958
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:27,751
Scott: Really?

959
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:28,559
Rym: Not Unipuma?

960
00:46:29,124 --> 00:46:30,600
Rym: I was always more a fan of Unipuma.

961
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,200
Scott: You could tell the difference if I had two pictures?

962
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,380
Rym: I'm pretty sure Unipuma had slightly lighter hair.

963
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:35,880
Rym: Pretty sure.

964
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,780
Scott: Could you tell the difference in the manga where there's no color?

965
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:38,939
Rym: Probably not.

966
00:46:39,161 --> 00:46:42,378
Rym: But manga didn't make a lot of sense, I remember, when I tried to read it.

967
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:43,980
Scott: All right.

968
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,280
Scott: Is there anything else to say about sailing around the moon?

969
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:46,840
Scott: I don't know.

970
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:53,900
Rym: I feel like I'm going to watch it all again because my memories of it, it's interesting.

971
00:46:54,020 --> 00:47:06,040
Rym: I remember all the big plot points and they seem really epic and interesting, but at the same time, watching episodes, I'm reminded that 90% of it is her saying, "Sukimi, kawate, ojikio, kyo," and doing all the transition.

972
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,939
Rym: Battles in middle episodes of the season are every Sailor Scout doing their scripted attack one by one.

973
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,360
Scott: Yeah, I'm saying the whole thing is what, 200-something episodes?

974
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:15,580
Rym: Exactly 200.

975
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,340
Scott: But the first season's only 26?

976
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:18,792
Scott: It's like, "Oh, all

977
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:19,058
Scott: right.".

978
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,130
Scott: Yeah.

979
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,040
Scott: And how many, there's five seasons, 20?

980
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,860
Scott: Hey, that doesn't make sense.

981
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,120
Scott: How do you get to 200 episodes with only five seasons?

982
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,654
Rym: Well, there's Sailor Moon, RS.

983
00:47:28,521 --> 00:47:30,260
Rym: Let me pull up the full list of episodes.

984
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:35,840
Scott: Some of those other letters of Sailor Moon have to have a lot more than 26 episodes to make this work, right?

985
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:36,820
Rym: Sailor Moon episodes.

986
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,120
Rym: Here we go, list of Sailor Moon episodes.

987
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,380
Rym: Let me get the full breakdown because I'm going to be off on some of my numbers.

988
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:40,851
Rym: Okay.

989
00:47:41,622 --> 00:47:42,920
Rym: Oh my God, no, I was wrong.

990
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:46,441
Rym: The original Sailor Moon is actually 46.

991
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:46,937
Scott: There you go.

992
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,939
Scott: That makes more sense.

993
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,854
Scott: I'm like, "How are they going to kill Queen Beryl if they've only just doing Monster of the Week right

994
00:47:52,895 --> 00:47:52,999
Scott: now?".

995
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,699
Scott: That makes no sense.

996
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,960
Rym: Six episodes were cut from the English release.

997
00:47:56,402 --> 00:47:57,278
Scott: Was the second one of them?

998
00:47:57,846 --> 00:47:58,079
Scott: Yes.

999
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,738
Scott: What were the other ones?

1000
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,619
Rym: So, the other ones were, let's see, what was cut?

1001
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,380
Rym: Punish Them, The House of Fortune is the monster mansion.

1002
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,240
Scott: Sailor Moon fucking loves punishing.

1003
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:13,699
Rym: A Monster's Scent, Shanella Steels Love, Protect the Melody of Love, Usagi's the Cupid's Scent, episodes five and six were both cut as well.

1004
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:14,175
Scott: All right.

1005
00:48:16,044 --> 00:48:17,300
Scott: We'll probably see those next Monday.

1006
00:48:18,143 --> 00:48:20,919
Rym: Episode 20, The Summer, The Ocean, Our Youth, and a Ghost.

1007
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,018
Rym: Ooh, spooky ghost.

1008
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,231
Rym: Yeah, 1992.

1009
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:27,504
Scott: I was 10.

1010
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:28,320
Rym: Oh, yeah, I forgot.

1011
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,060
Rym: So, they cut the entire backstory of Sailor Venus.

1012
00:48:32,948 --> 00:48:33,239
Scott: Okay.

1013
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:33,406
Scott: Okay.

1014
00:48:33,862 --> 00:48:34,758
Rym: They just skip that.

1015
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,240
Scott: Wait, so Sailor V you don't know anything about?

1016
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,331
Rym: Yeah, they basically just skip her past and her.

1017
00:48:40,532 --> 00:48:53,314
Rym: because, and I remember this because this is when I went to seek the fan subs when I learned about this episode, Sailor Venus basically has a friend who's, something weird happens and Sailor Moon.

1018
00:48:53,434 --> 00:49:00,939
Rym: all could have killed her and there's a debate where they almost kill a regular person and they decided that was too violent for American TV.

1019
00:49:01,445 --> 00:49:01,799
Scott: Okay.

1020
00:49:02,584 --> 00:49:04,060
Rym: Even though no actual violence happens.

1021
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:04,780
Rym: It's just an anime.

1022
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,579
Scott: There really isn't any violence in this.

1023
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,940
Scott: Sailor Moon doesn't punch or kick.

1024
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:08,479
Scott: She got cut?

1025
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,737
Scott: Yeah, but all she does is stand there and eventually throws the tiara.

1026
00:49:13,757 --> 00:49:15,980
Scott: and this isn't like an actual action scene, right?

1027
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,636
Scott: Utena has more action and it's more poorly animated because there's actually a sword fight going on.

1028
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,000
Scott: She just stands there, waits for the bad guy, and eventually she throws the tiara.

1029
00:49:25,701 --> 00:49:28,480
Rym: That trope does not change pretty much until the end of the show.

1030
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,959
Scott: You could probably watch.

1031
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,478
Scott: Why would you not?

1032
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:31,739
Scott: Why would you need to change it?

1033
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:41,019
Scott: The thing is, I wish she would just get there and just immediately be like, tiara action, dust done, instead of waiting there for like 10 minutes and then doing it.

1034
00:49:42,262 --> 00:49:44,765
Scott: It's like, all right, bad guy, I'm going to let you do a bunch of shit and then I'll do it.

1035
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,519
Scott: It's like, why?

1036
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,920
Scott: We just want to look at the bad guy because it's so ugly.

1037
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:48,520
Scott: I don't know.

1038
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,136
Rym: What's funny is that the title of the episodes almost seem to get longer and crazier as the show goes on.

1039
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:00,599
Rym: I mean, eventually you get the brightness of the ceiling of the calling stars, Haruka and company into the war.

1040
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,300
Scott: If we make a show, that's the kind of episode titles we're going to have.

1041
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,479
Rym: Yeah, that is pretty much the best way to title anything ever.

1042
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,340
Scott: Every title should be like a full...

1043
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:14,379
Rym: When the galaxy perishes, the sailor soldier's final battle is four episodes from the end.

1044
00:50:17,441 --> 00:50:23,000
Scott: Okay, so moons, sailing, important animes of historic note.

1045
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:28,780
Rym: We will probably do some for real modern reviews of every season, or at least every season.

1046
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:31,119
Scott: Yeah, we'll make a few videos.

1047
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,571
Scott: We're not going to do a video of every episode like Utena because it doesn't warrant it, and there's 200 of them.

1048
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,880
Rym: You can do an episode of every plot point, but that wouldn't take that long.

1049
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:54,639
Rym: But it's kind of like how if you tell someone the story of an X-Men comic, but you skip all the kind of stupid bullshit that happens in between the actual plot points, it sounds like a really interesting and epic story.

1050
00:50:55,222 --> 00:51:07,420
Rym: But then you read the comic, and there's all this bullshit in between, and the actual dramatic moments, knowing the spoiler of what happened is not much more dramatic than seeing it happen, or not much less dramatic.

1051
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:20,720
Rym: Sailor Moon is kind of the same way in that a lot of it is just stupid filler, but there's little character interactions and little bits that occur in every episode along the way that are actually really good and really plotty.

1052
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,620
Scott: I really wish I could see the consequences, like in the second episode of the kid being evil the day before.

1053
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,040
Rym: Yeah, like how come he wasn't kicked out of school and sent to jail?

1054
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,579
Scott: Right, and how about the other kids?

1055
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,441
Scott: And how come?

1056
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:37,039
Scott: every time the bad guys come, all they seem to do is put evil on every middle school kid in town?

1057
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:37,469
Rym: Yup.

1058
00:51:37,922 --> 00:51:39,140
Rym: Yes, you eighth graders!

1059
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,820
Rym: Go out and tear this town up.

1060
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:44,240
Scott: This will give energy to my boss enough to finish their evil plan.

1061
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,338
Rym: Well, Scott, you know what the answer is?

1062
00:51:45,721 --> 00:51:48,259
Rym: That's why Jedi is going to get Darth Vader in a little bit.

1063
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:50,839
Rym: Jedi is kind of milquetoast.

1064
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,580
Scott: Malachite and- He doesn't even do anything himself.

1065
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:55,700
Scott: All he does is like send out a bad guy to do something.

1066
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:02,000
Rym: Actually you can tell that I only watched the dub for the early episodes because I think his name is Kunzite in the Japanese.

1067
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:02,854
Scott: Anyway.

1068
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,580
Rym: Yeah, I know it was Malachite.

1069
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,136
Scott: Whatever.

1070
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,079
Rym: He's the baddest ass of all of them.

1071
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:15,030
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1072
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:20,130
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1073
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:25,550
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1074
00:52:25,832 --> 00:52:28,490
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1075
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:33,250
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1076
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,766
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1077
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:41,070
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1078
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,190
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
