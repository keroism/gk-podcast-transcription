00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,054

8
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:34,602
Rym: I tweeted out and the expected responses came back.

9
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:36,810
Rym: a lot of my friends OD'd on that video.

10
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:41,241
Rym: So I'm not gonna make it a thing of the day Cuz it's way too internet.

11
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:44,735
Rym: Like if you've ever complained about me Making a thing of the day.

12
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,370
Rym: That's just like way internet like Mouse Fan Club, for example.

13
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:50,808
Rym: This goes way beyond that.

14
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:59,758
Rym: so I'm gonna link to it in the forum but it's not gonna be part of the actual episode or an official thing of the Day because seriously this shit's so internet.

15
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:00,139
Rym: like.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,489
Rym: I cannot express to you how internet it is.

17
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:07,140
Rym: Bonus points for one in the bathroom.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,484
Rym: So his mom doesn't over here.

19
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:10,190
Scott: Why have we forwarded all the way to thing of the day?

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,855
Rym: This isn't a thing of the day.

21
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,488
Rym: Well, this is just my my day.

22
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:20,010
Rym: This is the opening that we just talk about stuff.

23
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:25,529
Rym: It's not my actual thing of the day because it's seriously it's too internet If I link to that as the thing of the day, it might break GeekNights.

24
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,849
Rym: What you can't talk about biking?

25
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:30,814
Rym: It's too cold to bike.

26
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:31,960
Scott: It's too cold to do anything.

27
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,089
Rym: It's not that cold to call the pod.

28
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,499
Rym: you you forget yourself young man.

29
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:39,014
Rym: You forget what it's like to live in Rochester.

30
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,843
Rym: It is not cold It's cold.

31
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:42,928
Scott: You go to Buffalo.

32
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:43,550
Scott: See what happens.

33
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:48,825
Rym: It's not that cold in Buffalo right now either just snowed Actually, so funnily enough.

34
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:50,489
Rym: I was at work right?

35
00:01:50,830 --> 00:02:01,660
Rym: I got three emails today from co-workers or people I know who just live in not America and All three of them asked me if I was okay and if I was trapped by.

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,174
Scott: Understand that New York City and New York State are two different things.

37
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:10,930
Rym: So yeah We're further away from Buffalo than like like.

38
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,300
Scott: I understand that it's right back to your point is from Buffalo.

39
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:18,745
Scott: I know the Quebec and Quebec City are different things and I don't live All right.

40
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,979
Rym: What's what ask the average person?

41
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,498
Rym: Anywhere in the US or anywhere in the world what the capital of Canada is?

42
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,520
Scott: all of Canada.

43
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:30,767
Rym: Do you know the capital of Canada?

44
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:32,252
Scott: I know the capitals of various problems.

45
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:34,980
Rym: You don't know the capital of Canada of all of Canada.

46
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,325
Scott: Yes, I didn't know capital.

47
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:38,232
Scott: I guess I never even thought that it had one.

48
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:40,200
Scott: I just only thought about provinces.

49
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,569
Scott: I never even considered such a thing.

50
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,020
Scott: Okay, uh, it's not Toronto.

51
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:50,227
Rym: I'm glad you know that not Quebec.

52
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:51,672
Rym: I'm almost more disturbed.

53
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:56,120
Rym: if you had just said it's not Toronto I would have assumed you knew and let it go.

54
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,982
Rym: But the fact that you admitted that you didn't know Canada had a cat I don't.

55
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:00,932
Scott: I didn't even consider that it would have one.

56
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:11,378
Rym: So yeah Anyway, guys Buffalo is so far away from New York City that it is effectively a different state and it's arguably Canada.

57
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:14,598
Rym: It's like a shabbier version of Canada.

58
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:19,132
Rym: So also Scott, it's only 31 degrees.

59
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:21,620
Rym: It's not that cold with the wind.

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,391
Rym: Wind chill is bullshit unless you're naked.

61
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:26,434
Rym: Are you naked outside?

62
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:27,236
Rym: Oh Scott.

63
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:28,500
Rym: All right fine wind chill.

64
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,463
Rym: You're gonna say wind chills.

65
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:30,005
Rym: the problem.

66
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:32,635
Rym: the wind chill only makes it 26.

67
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:33,659
Scott: I also don't have hair.

68
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:42,440
Rym: So that tiny amount of lost hair turned you from a man capable of walking outside in Rochester.

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,946
Scott: Listen, I'm still capable.

70
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,351
Scott: It's just not desirable.

71
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,114
Rym: I don't know if you are.

72
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:48,526
Rym: I think if we went to Rochester right now You might just die.

73
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:52,426
Rym: Oh Oh No death.

74
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:54,598
Rym: It's not cold out and you're a baby now.

75
00:03:55,633 --> 00:04:00,568
Rym: so anyway Wednesday Animation and all that you got news and Scott.

76
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:01,170
Rym: It's only 23 in Rochester.

77
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,386
Rym: So there's a list That can't you know.

78
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:06,913
Scott: anime news network for a long time.

79
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:08,420
Scott: I might have just been you know in dark.

80
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:20,738
Rym: I probably was just in the dark As you know put up lists of like animation DVD rankings like oh I used to Look every time I go to anime news network thinking oh I need some news for like a Wednesday show.

81
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:26,840
Rym: I see those lists I click on them and then I realize I have literally nothing to say about the DVD rankings.

82
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:37,220
Scott: And then I don't talk about right, but I don't know if they've been doing this for a while, but they did TV rankings Which I'd never saw them do before which is really kind of interesting at least to me.

83
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,067
Rym: So the way this is Japanese TV, right?

84
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:51,497
Scott: So this is the animations that are most watched on Japanese television and it's like oh Alright as of when as of like as of like November 3rd through 9th, it's like last week.

85
00:04:51,798 --> 00:05:03,128
Rym: Ah see It's always tricky with lists like that because the things that like an uninformed person or an American anime fan might think are popular Are one not on Japanese TV right now?

86
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,075
Rym: and two often not.

87
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:06,479
Rym: what's popular in Japan?

88
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:08,804
Rym: Did Naruto end yet?

89
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:10,167
Scott: I assume it did.

90
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:11,010
Rym: All right.

91
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:17,426
Rym: Uh, so if I had to guess number one You're safe, it's got to be like size.

92
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:18,810
Rym: I saw it or what it is.

93
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,476
Rym: What's number two like door?

94
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:26,710
Rym: I'm on those door All right number three.

95
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:29,340
Rym: I can't think of any more shows like that.

96
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:33,015
Rym: One piece.

97
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:34,908
Scott: This is farther down.

98
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:35,108
Scott: Okay.

99
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:35,490
Scott: Okay.

100
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,394
Scott: What about that?

101
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,960
Rym: I just got us to be on TV that that show where the guy eats exotic animal Toriko.

102
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,530
Scott: I don't know what that is and it's not on the list.

103
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:47,437
Rym: Okay one you've never seen Toriko.

104
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,146
Rym: that shits Delicious.

105
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,540
Rym: Okay and terrible.

106
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:52,449
Rym: Okay, I guess it's not an unlit.

107
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:58,599
Scott: All right, so saw that sound Doraemon Let's chibi Maruko Chan is the next one.

108
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,526
Scott: Yeah, anyway This is really interesting to see.

109
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:02,827
Scott: that like.

110
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:10,957
Scott: oh all these animes that are the ones that people in America watch Like say y'all pedal and all, you know, basically no one in Japan is watching those things.

111
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:11,659
Scott: He's not on TV.

112
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,466
Scott: It's like a nerd only deal.

113
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:19,760
Rym: Well, I mean look at old anime ask an average person in Japan Just like some kid like hey, what's cowboy bebop?

114
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,502
Rym: They might not know.

115
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:21,808
Rym: like not everyone cares about.

116
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:24,799
Rym: that show wasn't like super remembered by everybody.

117
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:27,632
Rym: Everybody knows what fist of the North Star is.

118
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,579
Scott: I Guess that's true.

119
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:30,848
Rym: Yeah Of course.

120
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:31,879
Rym: then again even in the u.s.

121
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:39,645
Rym: Like ask the average kid what Star Wars is and a lot of them have not actually seen any Star Wars, but I digress Mmm, that is sad indeed.

122
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:51,396
Rym: Yeah, so I've actually for whatever reason it's been animation season for me Like I've been playing you've been doing your thing But I've been mostly watching cartoons and playing video like PC games lately.

123
00:06:51,416 --> 00:07:00,240
Rym: All right Yeah, so I'm gonna geek bite all the cartoons I'm watching right now because Scott's not watching any of them and of course.

124
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:04,100
Rym: So, of course, it's a little skewed because this is like the off season.

125
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,872
Rym: It's like b-team because there's no new my little pony.

126
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:08,560
Rym: There's no new venture brothers.

127
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:11,418
Rym: The adventure time just like stopped and we're waiting for it to start again.

128
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:13,266
Rym: So There's no archers.

129
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:14,612
Rym: all my standbys aren't growing.

130
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:25,231
Rym: So I'm watching like my b-tier shows Mmm, so there's that my little pony like Gajinka show like the rainbow rocks Equestria girl that stuff.

131
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:26,219
Scott: Well, you're watching it.

132
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Rym: No, so the first movie that they released I watched because I had to you know be able to say it was shit.

133
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,720
Rym: You know, you got to try something before you can say it's shit and I tried it and it was pretty shit.

134
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:47,845
Rym: Okay so they made a sequel and apparently they hadn't originally planned on making a sequel and as far as I can tell they're turning that Into a like full-on Continuing thing.

135
00:07:48,488 --> 00:08:00,740
Rym: It looks like they're taking all the all the stuff they would do with gem if gem was re-released and just making that like a Sub brand with all the same proper new nouns as my little pony but way lower production values.

136
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:09,799
Rym: What's interesting is that because they're kind of going in this gem direction I watched a few bits from it and it's awful like it.

137
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,407
Rym: It's awful.

138
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:22,646
Rym: Like you get his own watchable baby stuff But it's actually popular among the demographic that the new my little pony friendship is magic was actually Originally targeted at.

139
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,639
Rym: this shit is way popular among young girls.

140
00:08:26,443 --> 00:08:26,844
Scott: You know what?

141
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:30,620
Rym: It's a perfectly fine little girl show like nothing wrong with that.

142
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:35,640
Rym: But seriously, you're a fan of like actual my little pony and you watch this stuff.

143
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:39,799
Rym: This stuff is really bad and you shouldn't be watching it.

144
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:51,548
Rym: But the really interesting thing is that they have quadrupled down on the music and they seem to have made this franchise Completely about the music and about music.

145
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:54,536
Rym: There are 12 songs in this short movie.

146
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:55,218
Scott: Whoa.

147
00:08:55,359 --> 00:09:01,300
Scott: Yeah Like any Disney movie that's as many songs as what is rainbow rocks, right?

148
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,689
Rym: Yeah, but the previous one also had a lot of music.

149
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,756
Rym: this one like quadrupled down on it.

150
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:08,100
Rym: music music music.

151
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,477
Rym: And it's interesting because it's the same guy Daniel Ingram doing this music.

152
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:19,860
Rym: Mm-hmm The music for this is way more generic and like lame poppy like way way way more generic.

153
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,320
Rym: But the production values of the music in this one are way way higher than from the previous one.

154
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:38,060
Rym: So I suspect I guess that among the like wider fandom of this stuff They're gonna be people who are fans of friendship is magic and you independently are fans of the music from this.

155
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:45,916
Rym: But we'll never actually watch this or if they do they won't admit to watching it, but seriously shits way unwatchable.

156
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:47,663
Rym: It's got.

157
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:52,241
Rym: I don't know it's don't watch it I Won't.

158
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:53,727
Scott: yeah, I wasn't planning on it.

159
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:55,956
Scott: I still didn't watch that equestria girls movie either.

160
00:09:55,976 --> 00:09:56,980
Rym: Yeah, I watched that one.

161
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,403
Rym: You know what?

162
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,429
Rym: Not great.

163
00:09:59,154 --> 00:09:59,999
Rym: Not great at all.

164
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,328
Rym: However, one of the songs from the new one.

165
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:12,020
Rym: I'm actually making a new tenant anime music video - Alright, yeah, I'm doing that that I have in all my life as an anime fan.

166
00:10:12,842 --> 00:10:17,417
Rym: I've never actually made an anime music video and I feel like it's time like that.

167
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,420
Rym: Bell never rings.

168
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,084
Rym: I never.

169
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:24,497
Scott: I mean we keep saying that but it's like you ever seen a clock that rings?

170
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:25,440
Scott: it doesn't make any sense.

171
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:29,710
Rym: Yeah, like grandfather clocks cuckoo clocks That's that's what they do.

172
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:38,280
Rym: Clocks used to make noises, you know, you know when it's like noon 15 and the clocks like doo doo doo doo.

173
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:43,599
Rym: I'm sure you've never encountered a real old clock.

174
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:50,995
Rym: You know, that's that sound like doo doo doo doo Doo doo doo, but that clock never rings.

175
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:55,348
Rym: So That clock used to ring and then it stopped.

176
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,300
Rym: so I've also been watching Steven Universe.

177
00:10:59,164 --> 00:10:59,586
Rym: that show.

178
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:06,212
Rym: if you've been avoiding it or ignoring it or not, like paying attention to it is Way good like way good it.

179
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:19,640
Rym: on one hand does this sort of like deconstruction of magical girls like very heavily Sailor Moon inspired but also Comedy show like, you know, the premise is that there's magical girls the gems, you know Sailor Moon magic.

180
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:22,073
Rym: But they live openly as magical girls.

181
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:26,740
Rym: Like everyone's like that's the magical girls They live in that house and they protect the planet from all the bullshit.

182
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:33,239
Rym: one of them basically dies giving birth to her son and He inherits her gem.

183
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:44,105
Rym: So it's a bunch of magical girls from space and this kid named Steven who's like 12 years old Who also has one of the gems and it's technically a magical girl And it's actually like.

184
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:47,414
Rym: it's like it's way funny like way funny.

185
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:49,480
Scott: Yeah, I know I saw some episodes of it early.

186
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:59,719
Rym: Yeah, so you know what early episodes it's gotten better, you know, like Adventure Time like it was really good But then it like like the goodness got better at an accelerating rate after a certain point.

187
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:01,828
Rym: Steven Universe did that too.

188
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:09,693
Rym: Like it got like every like the episode started getting like Exponentially funnier and then much like Adventure Time plot happens.

189
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:15,492
Rym: So it's got serious Dramatic like for real stuff and it kind of does.

190
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:21,466
Rym: it doesn't do the full big O But it does a little bit of big O because stuff happens and all the early episodes That's just kind of funny.

191
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,460
Rym: and you know magical girl monster of the week.

192
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,252
Rym: But then the show kind of goes in this direction of.

193
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:28,180
Rym: so look back at all those monsters of the week.

194
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,116
Rym: Yeah, you feel really bad about that now, don't you huh?

195
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:34,205
Scott: How many times has that happened?

196
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:35,169
Scott: about a zillion?

197
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,440
Rym: Yeah, but you know what that's often the sign of good media.

198
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:46,280
Scott: Steven Universe is super worth watching if you haven't watched it yet And I had so many other things to watch is not high on the list even saying it's not good.

199
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:48,520
Rym: What are you watching other than Yoah pedal?

200
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,959
Scott: Not much because I'm trying to watch anything.

201
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:55,820
Rym: So I'm also watching The Amazing World of Gumball.

202
00:12:56,882 --> 00:13:03,635
Rym: I've talked about The Amazing World of Gumball before on the show But suffice it to say it did everything that Steven Universe did in terms of.

203
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:09,860
Rym: with every season It's getting funnier and funny like to the point that it is one of my favorite comedy cartoons.

204
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:11,840
Scott: I mean, I guess there's a new mushishi anime.

205
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:19,414
Scott: I would watch that if I was gonna watch anything else that I wasn't already watching, you know I would watch that except I'm currently watching two Sailor Moons at the same time.

206
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:21,000
Scott: Yeah, I haven't watched a Sailor Moon.

207
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:23,724
Scott: I you know since like a long time ago I can tell you why.

208
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:31,214
Rym: that is because Sailor Moon's at R. now You know what R is just filler before S. R is like watching.

209
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:40,705
Scott: I'm still back in the like the The one where Sailor Moon's non-sailor friend when was getting with the bad guy That I'm still in that area.

210
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,811
Rym: Well, you don't even remember any of their names.

211
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,174
Scott: Do you something fright?

212
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:45,057

00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,559
Rym: What's Sailor Moon's name?

216
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:52,564
Scott: Usagi.

217
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:53,109
Rym: All right.

218
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:54,460
Rym: What's Sailor Mercury's name?

219
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,533
Scott: Yeah, temple girl.

220
00:13:57,553 --> 00:13:57,935
Scott: Yeah.

221
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,944
Rym: No, no, you already mixed him up.

222
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:04,384
Rym: That's Sailor Mars Mercury's the blue one with her bubble mist.

223
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:05,190
Scott: Yeah bubble mist.

224
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,070
Rym: There's this great moment in a recent episode of crystal.

225
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,810
Rym: Well, not a reason but the episode of crystal where Sailor Moon's like I can't do shit.

226
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,670
Rym: All the other sailors guys got awesome powers like fire lightning and the cats like this is what your other power is?

227
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,896
Rym: Yeah, she's.

228
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:23,308
Rym: no she's like fire lightning and mist.

229
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:29,254
Rym: if I were making if I were in charge of that show the person she was talking to would have been like yeah two of those Are cool.

230
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:41,231
Rym: two of those are useful Yeah, but gumball also wallet is primarily Really fucked up and kind of dark comedy like.

231
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:48,999
Rym: I'm actually really surprised at how dark this show is considering that it's like On Cartoon Network and is actually aimed at little kids.

232
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:52,230
Rym: It's like take it's like Malcolm time is on Cartoon Network.

233
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:55,580
Rym: The humor in adventure times.

234
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,750
Rym: more of this is too real for little kids, right?

235
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,426
Rym: but gumball is actually just too dark for little kids.

236
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:06,240
Rym: like Messed up shit happens and not in the like.

237
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:11,800
Rym: it's a very different kind of messed up shit from adventure times Like all kid shows like that nowadays all the good ones.

238
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:12,865
Rym: Exactly.

239
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:14,130
Scott: It's always been that way.

240
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,554
Scott: We watched Ren and Stimpy when we were kids.

241
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:20,168
Rym: Oh, no, right and Stimpy was not actually aimed at little kids on purpose.

242
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,592
Rym: I don't think It's always been.

243
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:25,161
Rym: also Ren and Stimpy was held out as an exception back then.

244
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:30,342
Rym: I mean Looney Tunes bringing people blow up Yeah, but everything was like that back then.

245
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:31,810
Scott: What about put guns each other's faces?

246
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,662
Rym: But what about the He-Man She-Ra era of the maximum sanitization?

247
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:43,970
Scott: even today shows that exist only to sell toys They're still like that But there aren't that many anymore cuz there aren't any setting weren't cartoons?

248
00:15:44,472 --> 00:15:49,488
Rym: But gumball has also had a bunch of like really serious and touching episodes recently.

249
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:57,313
Scott: Yeah, so He-Man There's a very special He-Man.

250
00:15:57,393 --> 00:15:58,395
Scott: I'm sure we can go and find it.

251
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:01,760
Rym: There is not serious touching in He-Man at any point.

252
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:21,185
Rym: So Yeah, I'm watching a ton of cartoons, but the only anime I'm watching is two flavors of Sailor Moon one of which I've already seen Mm-hmm, which is interesting to me that I'm watching for the first time in my life since I Was in high school.

253
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:22,430
Rym: No, cuz high school.

254
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,394
Rym: I was watching all anime.

255
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:24,900
Rym: I wasn't watching any American cartoons.

256
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:25,985
Scott: I thought you meant.

257
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:27,473
Scott: why is it Sailor Moon?

258
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:33,929
Rym: I'm watching more Non Japanese cartoons than Japanese cartoons on a daily basis.

259
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:37,600
Rym: That's a big flip from the majority of my life.

260
00:16:38,502 --> 00:16:41,860
Rym: I mean, I was watching anime like all the time when I was in elementary school.

261
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:46,640
Scott: New animes come out slower than they are exist to watch them.

262
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,400
Scott: Yeah, there's a ton new anime and I spending on where you put your bar.

263
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,140
Rym: I don't care about a lot of it and whenever there's an anime I care about it's like I've decided I'll never watch an anime.

264
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,356
Rym: I'm so I'm not super into because there's some anime that I like.

265
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:57,516
Rym: like.

266
00:16:57,536 --> 00:16:59,888
Rym: I like you a pedal But I'm not like oh fuck.

267
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:01,034
Rym: I gotta watch the next episode.

268
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:01,517
Scott: Oh fuck.

269
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:08,542
Rym: I gotta watch next Yeah, but then like when Monica came out, like I watch that whole thing literally as fast as I could Let's just watch it again.

270
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:10,209
Rym: I can watch it again tonight.

271
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:11,815
Scott: No, it's like evangelical tonight.

272
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:17,127
Scott: Yeah, cowboy bebop Only got so much time.

273
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:17,730
Scott: forget it work.

274
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:18,132
Rym: Yep.

275
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:19,520
Rym: So yeah, that's what I'm watching.

276
00:17:29,535 --> 00:17:31,320
Rym: So Things of the day.

277
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:53,773
Rym: If you are a person who sings there's like, you know in every hobby there's like the ridiculous bullshit that like people who are really good at that thing from a hobbyist perspective will do like the weird trick that Like a skier guy will do or like the guy who knows how to throw the baseball like swing the baseball bat But he like let's go of it and has a spin in the air and then catches it again.

278
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:55,139
Rym: like those kinds of tricks.

279
00:17:56,132 --> 00:18:08,200
Rym: this is yeah, but but but things that require a Surprising and or extreme amount of skill and talent but which are not actually useful in the professional practice of that craft.

280
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:14,716
Rym: So for most singers polyphonic overtones are that they're crazy hard to do.

281
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:16,280
Rym: They're really interesting.

282
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,010
Rym: Almost no music in the world requires it.

283
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:25,491
Scott: Also, I never knew about this before like a minute ago It sounds 100% like a theremin.

284
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:26,696
Scott: So there's no reason to do it.

285
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:29,260
Scott: if you have a theremin It's like if you have a theremin.

286
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:36,734
Scott: There is no reason to have this technique for musical purpose because and even if you wanted to make music with this sound You don't need to hire a person who can do it.

287
00:18:36,754 --> 00:18:37,600
Scott: You just buy a third Scott.

288
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,360
Rym: There are kinds of music that you guys that so her singing in the way It sounds was just because of what she was singing.

289
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,610
Rym: Mongolian music also uses it but it sounds more like deep farts.

290
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,696
Scott: Couldn't I just tune my fucking theremin?

291
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:53,205
Rym: No, actually It'll be sure.

292
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:55,380
Scott: I could take my theremin run it through a computer and be all set.

293
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,650
Rym: You could not make your theremin sound like Tuva music.

294
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:00,415
Scott: I could make get a didgeridoo.

295
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:01,017
Scott: That's pretty close.

296
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,610
Rym: Uh Could you play a didgeridoo?

297
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:04,456
Rym: I I would give.

298
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:09,339
Rym: I will give you $500 if you ever successfully play a didgeridoo in front of me.

299
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:12,300
Scott: Go buy me that a tiny cheap didgeridoo.

300
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:13,137
Rym: You gotta buy one.

301
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:16,609
Scott: If it cost me a lot of money you have not profiting.

302
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:27,989
Scott: if you ever in the rest of the time that you and I are both alive Successfully and probably lives on his last 500 bucks in the retirement home and then I'll just pray I have nothing better to do I'll practice didgeridoo all day.

303
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,797
Rym: Yeah, then my last words will be Jefferson lives.

304
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:35,345
Scott: And then my last words be So.

305
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:52,260
Rym: Yeah, this is a video that actually explains in pretty deep detail What that is and how it works like for real and it's fascinating if you are a singer or an audio engineer.

306
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:54,180
Scott: It is fascinating and completely useless.

307
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:58,137
Scott: Yeah, the most difficult yet useless talent I've ever seen.

308
00:19:58,258 --> 00:20:02,380
Rym: so Scott I also practice clicking on heads in video games.

309
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:04,760
Scott: That is much less difficult than this.

310
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,124
Scott: Otherwise equally useless.

311
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:10,739
Scott: our actually not as useless because you can win a competition and mad moneys if you are very good at it.

312
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,479
Rym: I'll bet there's competitions for polyphonic overtone singing.

313
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:16,370
Scott: I bet they make you less money if you win.

314
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,080
Rym: then the counter-strike I could do it with humming and whistling at the same time.

315
00:20:22,193 --> 00:20:23,408
Scott: We've done this on the show before.

316
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:27,135
Rym: I can also do the for the fifth flip.

317
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:32,149
Rym: Sure.

318
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,741
Rym: Yeah But I can't do polyphonic whistling.

319
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:38,173
Rym: no no Anyway, you got a thing of the day.

320
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:44,450
Scott: So in Russia crazy shit happens like dash cams and produces many great things of the day.

321
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:47,648
Scott: It's a great place to watch on YouTube and not a great place to go.

322
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:50,690
Scott: So let us watch Russia on YouTube.

323
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:56,935
Scott: here is a crazy thing that happens the dudes chilling out and what looks to be like a nice restaurant and Something strange is going on.

324
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,484
Scott: There's like a lady with two dudes moving about.

325
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,669
Scott: you can't tell what's going on.

326
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:00,930
Scott: Really?

327
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,795
Scott: There's no audio.

328
00:21:02,237 --> 00:21:04,430
Scott: Not that we would understand the Pockner ease anyway.

329
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:08,970
Scott: And then a whole bunch of dudes come in with a little bit of the ultra violence.

330
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:11,779
Rym: Oh, I saw that sparkling to that thing.

331
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:13,265
Rym: Let me see if I can find the headline they used.

332
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:16,636
Scott: Yeah, and then You know something happened.

333
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,610
Scott: I guess this continues my trend of thing of the days of badass dudes.

334
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,479
Scott: Yeah, watch and see how badass this dude is.

335
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:25,810
Scott: I would probably be doing a similar thing to that, dude.

336
00:21:26,272 --> 00:21:27,981
Rym: Well, you know what is like to think I would be any.

337
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,448
Rym: it's like those videos you see.

338
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:34,990
Rym: occasionally We're like someone pulls out a gun at a bank and like tries to rob the teller and teller just like looks at them.

339
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,833
Rym: They're like put that away.

340
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,639
Rym: Mm-hmm, or they just like don't react.

341
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:38,040
Scott: Yep.

342
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:39,184
Rym: Like no, sir.

343
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:39,846
Rym: I really need to see.

344
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:49,718
Rym: right behind a bulletproof glass There was a nut.

345
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:51,330
Rym: so there's this high road you.

346
00:21:52,792 --> 00:22:06,890
Rym: there was a similar story on FARC recently along these lines like a similar thing happened and there was a picture of the two perpetrators and It was from an upward angle and one of them was really fat.

347
00:22:07,352 --> 00:22:11,810
Rym: The first post in the thread was a was a meme of tyro.

348
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:13,982
Rym: It was beautiful.

349
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:19,059
Rym: It's epic In the moment the book club book is water ship down.

350
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:26,624
Rym: It's about rabbits and crazy cultist rabbits and Fascist rabbits and it's a pretty good book and I'm really digging it.

351
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:28,050
Scott: the animal farmer rabbits.

352
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:30,234
Rym: Yeah, except an animal farm.

353
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,318
Rym: They're a rabbit farm.

354
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:31,779
Rym: Yeah.

355
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:43,235
Rym: Well, there is a rabbit farm perhaps less Orwellian though Literally less Orwellian In that sense, yes Watch all our stuff on YouTube.

356
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:44,159
Scott: Yep.

357
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:44,761
Rym: Yeah.

358
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:47,210
Scott: Also, you know, I say we're on all the place on the internet.

359
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,885
Scott: Well, whenever I find a new place on the internet to be I go there.

360
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:52,050
Rym: Yeah, what is that thing?

361
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,414
Scott: So here's the thing.

362
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:55,384
Rym: face retweeted it, but I don't know what it is.

363
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:59,990
Scott: So Facebook made an app That's currently only for iOS, but I'm sure will eventually be for other OS.

364
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:04,222
Scott: It's called rooms and the way it works is you can make.

365
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:06,430
Scott: you can make an account with no Facebook account.

366
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,550
Scott: You don't need to have a Facebook account for you anti Facebook folks and way works.

367
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,623
Scott: You make a room and a room is sort of like an IRC channel kind of.

368
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:20,229
Scott: it's like a channel and you can invite people to the room and if you created the room you set the rules for the room and whatnot.

369
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:25,750
Scott: and You invite people to the room and they join the room with a barcode or by typing stuff in or whatever.

370
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:29,107
Scott: They join the room Once you're in the room.

371
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:39,390
Scott: Imagine an IRC chat except instead of being an IRC chat It's more like an Instagram feed where you can post photo or text or both as each post is like a square.

372
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:40,869
Rym: Wait, so is this just Google Wave?

373
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,459
Scott: No, you're not editing things.

374
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:45,270
Rym: Okay, so we're just sharing things, right?

375
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:45,693
Scott: It's it's.

376
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:58,870
Scott: imagine if there's an IRC chat room But instead of lines of text and each post each post was a square that could contain text or a photo like Instagram And you can just make as many of these as you want and have people join them.

377
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,649
Scott: They can be moderated or free or you know, you whoever made it controls it, right?

378
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:05,709
Scott: So It's pretty interesting.

379
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:16,919
Scott: So I made a GeekNights one and I put stuff in it Even though like the five people who are in it aren't paying attention probably deleted the app already that but you know I'm just gonna stick with it cuz the only way to make it work.

380
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:22,206
Scott: Yeah, I'm sticking with every single Internet outlet that we have full-on.

381
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:26,230
Rym: Yep In fact, I mean our IRC has actually been slightly rocking lately.

382
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,317
Scott: I got an IRC client for my phone if you.

383
00:24:28,818 --> 00:24:33,149
Scott: so if you have iOS and you're wondering which I which IRC client should I get on my phone?

384
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,970
Scott: There's one that costs money called palaver.

385
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,343
Scott: That is the best one.

386
00:24:37,403 --> 00:24:41,039
Scott: pay money for it If you want to use IRC on your mobile iOS devices.

387
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:44,549
Scott: duly noted if you're not using iOS, I can't help you.

388
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:58,810
Rym: So long ago, there was the BN puppycat two episode Thing the pilot the cute thing that Surprisingly many of our friends every time they people came over were like blah blah blah BN puppycat.

389
00:24:58,891 --> 00:24:59,680
Rym: They didn't know what it was.

390
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,529
Rym: Then we showed it to him.

391
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:07,230
Scott: Well, you know that people aren't necessarily subscribed to channel Frederator slash cartoon hangover on YouTube not watching everything.

392
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,558
Scott: They put out a lot of pilots for different things on there.

393
00:25:09,678 --> 00:25:23,730
Scott: Yeah single episodes of various animation good some man Yeah, but you know the BN puppycat one was particularly Interesting because it was had some hints of adventure time had some good voice acting and quality dialogues.

394
00:25:25,112 --> 00:25:28,684
Scott: The puppycat has a vocaloid voice which gave it props.

395
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:30,350
Rym: Don't tell me what to do.

396
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,930
Scott: Right, you know it was generally pretty interesting.

397
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:39,229
Scott: So that one got a Kickstarter to make for real episodes like bravest warriors has yep.

398
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:52,149
Scott: So this was like one of the first like really solid Examples of a new way to make media make a bunch of free one shots and when people figure out which ones a hit and Then make it for reals.

399
00:25:52,370 --> 00:26:01,784
Rym: But again the crowdsourcing of people paid just so that the thing would exist and once enough money Existed for the thing to exist then everyone gets it.

400
00:26:01,804 --> 00:26:03,010
Rym: You don't even have to worry about piracy.

401
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:03,132
Rym: No

402
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:16,609
Scott: It's a hundred percent 100% free because we paid for it to be made and the people who made it took some of that money to live with and they use the other money for Computers and whatnot that they needed to make it software's and that and they did it.

403
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,082
Rym: So I got to see the first three episodes at a like it.

404
00:26:20,102 --> 00:26:21,748
Scott: Well, I've only seen two episodes.

405
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,659
Scott: Yeah Yeah, what's that third episode?

406
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,009
Scott: you saw beach episode?

407
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:34,749
Rym: Yeah, it's So being puppycat that what's out now like there's gonna be a bunch of episodes.

408
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:39,514
Rym: and Now that Scott's seen it too, and you've all seen it We can actually kind of review.

409
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:41,883
Scott: I only saw the pilot and two episode.

410
00:26:42,104 --> 00:26:43,510
Scott: Yeah, cuz that's what they put out to start.

411
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:46,702
Rym: Yeah, so you've seen two episodes of the actual, you know season.

412
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:48,369
Rym: I got the real scene three.

413
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:51,520
Scott: I thought the characters names except for B and puppy.

414
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,503
Rym: Yeah Deckard.

415
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:53,426
Scott: Yeah, that's him.

416
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:54,470
Rym: How could you forget Deckard?

417
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:55,575
Scott: I just know that he's dude.

418
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:56,480
Scott: He's the dude.

419
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,204
Scott: I don't remember his name.

420
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:59,433
Rym: Yeah, no one else No one else's names.

421
00:26:59,474 --> 00:26:59,995
Rym: I think matter.

422
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:01,260
Scott: What's the intelligent girl's name?

423
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:02,945
Rym: Oh the sister?

424
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,370
Rym: Yeah, I already forgot her name.

425
00:27:04,932 --> 00:27:12,340
Scott: She might be the best actual character though other than yes, that's the kind of character I like sane person with no drama or any fucked-up problem.

426
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,447
Rym: Well also known as the straight man.

427
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,256
Rym: Yes However, I also human being.

428
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:18,319
Rym: I also like the.

429
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,690
Rym: well, she is the furlough that guy.

430
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:25,409
Rym: Yeah, well that guy is my kind of money a lot of bad guy.

431
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:32,690
Scott: Puppycat is also sort of the straight man in a way the straight the straight animal.

432
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:35,121
Scott: So it's a lot like the cat from Sailor Moon.

433
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:40,999
Rym: the newbie and puppy cat is Substantially different from the pilot as all shows are from the pilot.

434
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,363
Rym: Yes, and you know what?

435
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:44,890
Rym: I think it's a change for the better.

436
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:53,977
Scott: Well, I mean if it was all like the pilot it would just be too much Right, like it'd be like full power all the time with crazy stuff like, you know Candy's gone.

437
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,356
Rym: Yeah Right.

438
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:57,463
Scott: So that's a great line.

439
00:27:57,483 --> 00:27:58,649
Scott: never gonna lose that one.

440
00:27:58,931 --> 00:28:11,642
Rym: But if the whole thing was like that it just become tiresome, you know coming on too strong Yep, so the newbie and puppy got basically back like it zoomed out a little bit so you see more of the world and Has like actual character.

441
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:13,250
Rym: and besides just stop.

442
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,050
Scott: Yes that way cuz I mean how far could you get with just be in puppy?

443
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:22,025
Rym: Yeah, it gives you there is a point of reference as opposed to literally no point of reference.

444
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:22,426
Scott: Yep.

445
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,358
Rym: I Really like it actually.

446
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:27,610
Scott: Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna watch all the episodes that come out.

447
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:35,458
Rym: I'm glad that the primary thing they kept is these like personality as Experience through the voice acting right.

448
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:38,930
Scott: but then they sort of you know, it's not just who is this crazy person.

449
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,538
Scott: It's like oh this part, you know, this person is actually crazy.

450
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:47,050
Scott: Yeah, and The friends are concerned about that and it's a problem.

451
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:47,953
Rym: You know what?

452
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:51,343
Rym: This is I think B is what will happen to Nana.

453
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:55,549
Rym: remember Nana if she doesn't get her shit together Eventually, she's gonna be like this.

454
00:28:55,831 --> 00:29:08,015
Scott: Well, I think you know you look at some like adventure time, right and you have Finn and to a lesser extent Jake being sort Of immature crazily but also mature at the same time like they take care of themselves in their house You know, they can.

455
00:29:08,076 --> 00:29:09,467
Scott: they can get shit done when they have to.

456
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:24,938
Scott: Yep It's like they can alternate between you know, having wacky dialogues and being seemingly, you know, complete children going But also just being adults and taking care of their shit Both things going on at the same time moving

457
00:29:24,978 --> 00:29:28,448
Rym: more forward toward adults as the show gets more and more adult and serious,

458
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:39,110
Scott: obviously Yeah, but B on the other hand right seems to Less adult like there's some amount of adultness there and ability to realize to do something and do something.

459
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:43,310
Rym: B is the kind of person who as a child ate that marshmallow immediately, right?

460
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:51,350
Scott: But mostly it's like okay your incredible silliness being a cartoon character is actually a problem in this adult world.

461
00:29:52,751 --> 00:30:00,550
Scott: It's not so good and We're gonna have to fix that over the course of these episodes to some extent or maybe not and that's gonna be what this is.

462
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:03,253
Rym: Yeah But I like that.

463
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:04,076
Rym: I like how they made.

464
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:07,750
Rym: they took her core essence and it's like it's like it.

465
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:14,662
Rym: You know in utenna there's an example because we've been doing a lot of stuff with utenna lately Crazy anime crap happens in that show, but then the show stops.

466
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:15,525
Rym: He was like yo dawg.

467
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:16,970
Rym: all that crazy crap happened.

468
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:20,847
Rym: Why did you just accept that that crazy crap was happening just because it was a cartoon?

469
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:28,390
Rym: Yeah But then like he man like crazy cartoon craft happened just because crazy cartoon crap happened.

470
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:39,838
Rym: Yeah It's a cartoon that literally never the fact that backgrounds were repeating and looping was not a commentary on the existential nature of man No in he-man, but a new tenor.

471
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:43,290
Rym: a looping background is like how did that background loop?

472
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,315
Scott: I mean, it's a cartoon sure But you know if you exist.

473
00:30:46,576 --> 00:30:47,839
Scott: pretend that these are real people.

474
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,384
Scott: how does their looping background?

475
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:55,281
Rym: and we'll talk about the looping background When we talk about episode 39 of shoujo kakamei utenna.

476
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:58,630
Rym: in our series GeekNights presents shoujo kakamei utenna.

477
00:30:58,931 --> 00:30:59,895
Scott: You should probably watch that.

478
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:01,682
Scott: we're gonna continue it sometime soon.

479
00:31:01,783 --> 00:31:02,385
Rym: Oh my god.

480
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:03,570
Rym: Not like now that I got those bure's.

481
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:12,589
Rym: Yeah, you can see the Individual defects of brush lines on the cells if you zoom in.

482
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,917
Scott: well Let's talk about more bees and cats.

483
00:31:14,977 --> 00:31:15,318
Scott: a puppy.

484
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,682
Scott: cat is a puppy and a cat sort of this weird in-between character Obviously created to sell merchandise.

485
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:21,627
Scott: much like cat bug.

486
00:31:21,728 --> 00:31:25,039
Scott: yeah But I like cat bug better.

487
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:28,270
Scott: cat bug actually says funny things where?

488
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:41,188
Scott: Puppycat has a cool vocaloid voice which is awesome But it doesn't really because of that inability to like really talk It's so I think I think it's partly catch phrases, or you can't really impersonate it.

489
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,857
Scott: besides going like Tell me what to do.

490
00:31:44,158 --> 00:31:58,177
Rym: yeah, so I think it's that with cat bug Cat bug is an earnest little kid And it's kind of like that scene where cat bug killed that jelly kid whatever spoilers And then you know he's like.

491
00:31:58,197 --> 00:31:59,562
Rym: I don't see what the big deal is like.

492
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:03,255
Rym: like there's cool stuff going on with that kind of Like earnest child character.

493
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:12,300
Rym: that's also kind of this like animal predator thing, but puppy cats actually just Acts and Doesn't look, but acts like an adult.

494
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:14,810
Scott: Yeah, it's an intelligent adult person.

495
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,854
Rym: It's like I need these weapons.

496
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:18,826
Scott: It just happens to be in this body, and it's trying to get the job done.

497
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:22,099
Rym: Yeah Is it just me?

498
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:23,527
Rym: or was there a?

499
00:32:23,547 --> 00:32:34,962
Rym: because Two other people said this to me, and I agree with them that in the first two episodes of the newbie and puppy cat There is a direct romantic subtext between bee and puppy cat.

500
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:39,597
Rym: there's malt there two indirect kisses A tiny bit.

501
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,730
Rym: she steals the gum back out of his mouth.

502
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:53,050
Scott: Yeah But I mean it's it's sort of one of those things where it's like a You know and then in the dream with the hand yeah, yeah, that's there, so that's there.

503
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,773
Rym: It's not just me.

504
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:58,650
Scott: is yeah is puppy cat like symbolizing another person gonna literally transform into another person?

505
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,550
Rym: Well puppy cat is obviously that Prince.

506
00:33:02,492 --> 00:33:05,427
Rym: Sure, yeah, right trapped in the body of a puppy cat.

507
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:09,548
Scott: yep Sucks for the dude character guy.

508
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:14,589
Rym: Yeah, well he needs to move on with his life according to the plot so far.

509
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:15,109
Scott: Yeah.

510
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:22,899
Scott: So the deal with that dude who wasn't in the pilot is he's sort of taking care of bee Because someone like that needs taking care of like.

511
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:35,150
Rym: you get the impression that she would starve to death locked in her apartment If he wasn't like watching out for her right And he can cook and do adult things, but at the same time like he's basically neglecting his own life.

512
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:40,970
Scott: You know he's awesome at cooking and should go to cooking school apparently, but instead he's taking care of this person.

513
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,199
Scott: He's not even related to that cooking school.

514
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:46,009
Rym: I'm pretty sure is exactly like our on high school host club.

515
00:33:46,531 --> 00:33:48,858
Rym: I'm pretty sure that's how I imagine that is also.

516
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:50,302
Scott: Are you cooking Academy also?

517
00:33:50,342 --> 00:33:53,757
Rym: He has heterochromia, and that's definitely on purpose Mm-hmm.

518
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,607
Scott: And then there's the girl who like is basically just the same person.

519
00:33:58,647 --> 00:33:59,270
Scott: I forget her name.

520
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:02,470
Scott: Yeah, well you and she's pretty much is telling him like hey, you should go to cooking school.

521
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:04,563
Scott: Don't take care of this child girl person.

522
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:15,927
Rym: Yeah your whole life That's not your problem, but it's definitely this show is very much a bunch of internet mashed together on Top of a thin but workable plot thread.

523
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:24,230
Rym: yeah Like you just take a bunch of strong characters dump a ton of internet around them And then I think just kind of wing it in terms of the writing from that.

524
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:26,418
Scott: Yeah, the only thing is it's sort of so.

525
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:43,989
Scott: each episode is like a you know a real-world Conflict of some kind and then B goes to fight some sci-fi solve some sci-fi problems somewhere in like this other dimension or some shit and Then that somehow symbolizes Resolving the problem that's happening in the real world.

526
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:48,130
Rym: I thought of that except notice how she doesn't actually resolve really any.

527
00:34:49,250 --> 00:35:06,825
Rym: It's very strange, so if you take this at face value B is a mentally challenged Person with problems Who like she goes she visits this guy goes into his bathroom passes out and has a fever dream And then wakes up at night and leaves.

528
00:35:07,288 --> 00:35:12,230
Rym: yep She's escaping the world and not actually solving her real-world problems.

529
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,576
Rym: Escapism is the actual problem.

530
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:19,950
Scott: the thing is is that other dimension problem solving mission heroism thing?

531
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,873
Scott: That's going on.

532
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,559
Scott: is that literal?

533
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,890
Scott: or is that just in her head is like or is it just gonna be internet?

534
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,074
Rym: And that's not the part that matters.

535
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:31,090
Scott: yeah, and like the puppy cat something that like is anyone even see the puppy cat besides her?

536
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:33,310
Rym: Well, we know Deckard sees it okay.

537
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:37,469
Rym: She holds it up, and she's like smell it, but no one hears him talking.

538
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:41,825
Rym: Only she hears him talk, and he is definitely a cat with dog smell.

539
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:44,922
Rym: so if we're gonna analyze this shit It could just be a cat with dog smell.

540
00:35:44,982 --> 00:35:45,849
Rym: that doesn't exist.

541
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:49,626
Rym: There's no cat with dog smell persistent dog smell and a cat could not.

542
00:35:49,646 --> 00:35:57,969
Rym: a cat-shaped dog also even like he's weird-looking and and He went and got all those weapons.

543
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:02,410
Rym: Let's tried to buy all those weapons because they did buy that the brass knuckles anyway.

544
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,648
Rym: Right I mean, maybe it could be Fight Club.

545
00:36:10,054 --> 00:36:12,368
Rym: Do we need to do geek guys presents being puppy cat?

546
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,159
Scott: Is it be clever fight cat?

547
00:36:15,461 --> 00:36:17,729
Rym: I feel like we could actually do that for this show.

548
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:18,453
Rym: I can't.

549
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:20,726
Rym: I would watch a show called fight cat.

550
00:36:20,947 --> 00:36:28,028
Scott: Let's make it a Cat and then And it fights for serious like doo-doo-doo.

551
00:36:28,993 --> 00:36:30,297
Scott: You know those sort of like.

552
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:41,628
Scott: you know it'll be like cute cat like you know with boxing gloves like Right and then you get that zoom in on the face you get the fist of the North Star kind of face like That's a cat face, and then the opponent is like a dog.

553
00:36:41,668 --> 00:36:44,884
Scott: It's like And then you know.

554
00:36:45,892 --> 00:36:49,345
Scott: So just take a hajimana info script and just reanimate it with animals.

555
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:54,490
Rym: so in the third episode Not to spoil anything, but there's there's another character that whoa.

556
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:57,370
Rym: It's one of those characters.

557
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:05,499
Rym: I don't care tell me everything a character that does not fit in the world in the same way that Detective Conan being in an anime.

558
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:05,920
Rym: That's not.

559
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,130
Rym: detective Conan as a cameo is always really weird.

560
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:19,145
Rym: So just like princess bubblegum basically her landlord is a an actual child Like this little kid all right, and there's not just a small person.

561
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:20,610
Rym: It's definitely a child.

562
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,470
Scott: But is it just landlords child?

563
00:37:24,531 --> 00:37:25,053
Rym: That is.

564
00:37:25,153 --> 00:37:26,318
Rym: that is not the implication.

565
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:29,129
Scott: is it like a child king of like a weird tiny country?

566
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:34,870
Rym: now It is possible still that B is just crazy, and that's just a neighbor kid, and she thinks he's the landlord.

567
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:37,649
Rym: So I guess I could still read into it that way.

568
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,521
Scott: But how does she ever pay the rent?

569
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:40,910
Scott: like how did she even pay the first rent?

570
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:48,344
Rym: How did she even get the apartment in the first place cuz her mom's actually like dead in the other room and social security checks Just keep coming into an automated account and like the shows are gonna.

571
00:37:48,364 --> 00:37:49,390
Rym: Go real dark real quick.

572
00:37:50,810 --> 00:38:01,404
Rym: Remember when I was at that night that screening Natasha herself did a Q&A and when someone asked her What like what she does is a hobby what she's basically said?

573
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:09,510
Rym: something along the lines of yeah I read that Wikipedia article on like the strangest deaths that have ever occurred in history to humans.

574
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:10,193
Rym: Mm-hmm.

575
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:16,886
Rym: and then we tie that like that became the topic conversation for a while so I would not put it past her for that to be the plot sure.

576
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,154
Rym: but Notice how the.

577
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:27,959
Rym: the show is very atmospheric in that music and background noise like it'll have a very slow Fuzzy dreamlike atmosphere all the time.

578
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,685
Rym: It's more atmospheric than it.

579
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:31,310
Scott: the other dimension is the real thing.

580
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:34,028
Scott: This is the dream that looks like our real world.

581
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,930
Scott: Actually, well you know she woke up in that bathroom.

582
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:46,557
Rym: she didn't go to sleep in it because she moved from an apartment to a house like a part like the bit like the Setting change between the pilot and the real show.

583
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:54,643
Rym: you can argue that the dream the the fighting monsters temp job world is more consistent than the quote-unquote real world.

584
00:38:54,724 --> 00:38:55,808
Scott: is the pilot even canon?

585
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:57,472
Rym: I Will.

586
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,549
Rym: I'm going to tweet at her and ask her if the pilot is canon tonight.

587
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:02,775
Rym: Well see because I asked.

588
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:07,368
Rym: I you know I got the official answer that the My Little Pony comic is canon.

589
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:11,301
Rym: sure From the author of the comic like that's.

590
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:13,550
Rym: that shit's legit as far as I'm concerned.

591
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:17,989
Rym: but the third episode is way atmospheric.

592
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:29,930
Rym: When they go to the beach the beach the beach There's also a crabby guy you're gonna like I can imagine puppycat in some sort of like floating device the crab in the water.

593
00:39:30,594 --> 00:39:32,707
Rym: Yeah, I think you're gonna like the crabby guys.

594
00:39:32,727 --> 00:39:34,958
Scott: aesthetic I mean you already have a beach and a crabby.

595
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:35,962
Scott: that doesn't really.

596
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:37,650
Scott: you know you're already hitting on all cylinders.

597
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,922
Rym: Yeah, well, I guess when you watch the episode they eat crab.

598
00:39:41,544 --> 00:39:45,309
Rym: how they get to the beach You didn't answer me if they ate crab I had to.

599
00:39:48,412 --> 00:39:54,128
Rym: So how they get to the beach actually reinforces your possible idea that the real world of being puppycat is the dream.

600
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:58,220
Scott: they use the dimension thingy They go to sleep, and they wake up as the beach.

601
00:39:58,622 --> 00:40:00,130
Rym: They wander there by accident.

602
00:40:01,912 --> 00:40:04,262
Rym: All right, you'll see it's it's it'll be out soon.

603
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:04,825
Rym: I assume.

604
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:21,230
Rym: I mean it's done, so Hmm yeah being puppycat shows like this like short pilots of animation and short kickstarter-y shows If you care about this stuff at all like any animation or TV the investment you have to put in to consume this media.

605
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,561
Scott: Go to YouTube click on a thing and sit there for like five.

606
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,370
Scott: ten minutes is so low.

607
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,170
Rym: Da mecha dobutsu requires more investment than this show.

608
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,602
Scott: Oh, yeah, it has all these long openers and closes and down with.

609
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:36,321
Scott: you have to see it to fast-forward through The code of the RIT anime club.

610
00:40:36,522 --> 00:40:37,950
Rym: you never fast-forward through shit.

611
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:43,650
Rym: We watch the opener and the closer to risky safety end times and being the number of episodes.

612
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:49,190
Scott: If you haven't seen risky safety and especially if you haven't seen Tomokodobutsu you should watch Tomokodobutsu.

613
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,837
Rym: Should we bring that panel back for anime Boston?

614
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:52,685
Scott: Yeah, I got any other better ideas.

615
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:53,428
Rym: Let's do it.

616
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:55,795
