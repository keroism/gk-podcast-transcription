00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,278
Rym: It's Wednesday, May 5th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:10,479
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:13,446
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:19,709
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, talking about adventure time in continuance with a guest.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,738
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,399
Scott: So it was really warm today.

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,359
Rym: It was warm today.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,560
Scott: I was thinking about biking to work.

9
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,139
Rym: I bike to work every day all week.

10
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:37,299
Scott: You don't have to go home after this show, do you?

11
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:40,299
Scott: If I had biked to work, I would have to bike now.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,980
Scott: And I'm leaving right from your place.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,818
Scott: So it's nice out.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,288
Scott: And you know what?

15
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:43,819
Scott: It's gonna rain.

16
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,416
Rym: Scott, I note this now.

17
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:52,669
Rym: For all the years you've been living here, if you look at the forecast and it's like 1% chance of rain, you're like, "Not biking!

18
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:53,054
Rym: Not

19
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:53,378
Rym: biking!".

20
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:58,080
Scott: I now have more accurate weather reporting thanks to pimping Yahoo weather.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,319
Scott: The Yahoo weather app tells you the hour.

22
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,479
Rym: Scott, so does the built-in Android app.

23
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,578
Scott: Fine, it tells you when the rain will begin.

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,700
Scott: Look at this timeline.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,280
Scott: Alright, when is the rain gonna begin?

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,380
Scott: Scott, it said the rain will start at 8 and right now it's 7.20.

27
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,042
Rym: Yes, you know what?

28
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:18,880
Rym: At 8, there is only a 20% chance of rain in Long Island City and Astoria.

29
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:20,619
Scott: That's not what mine said.

30
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,940
Rym: That's what mine said.

31
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,970
Scott: Mine said like 90% tonight.

32
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,769
Rym: Also, you're a little baby.

33
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:26,412
Rym: It's some rain.

34
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,680
Rym: Just suck it the fuck up.

35
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:30,459
Scott: I'm not gonna ruin my clothing by biking in rain.

36
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:33,860
Scott: But anyway, this Sunday is gonna be amazing.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:34,967
Rym: Yeah.

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,679
Scott: This Sunday I'm gonna bike all day.

39
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:41,200
Rym: So I was biking home and I was a little late to do the show.

40
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,560
Rym: Partly because with my Google Glass on biking, which by the way, the Strava app on Glass is pretty great.

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,599
Scott: Yeah, I get to install it and set it up.

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,770
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't just use the phone for GPS.

43
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,540
Rym: It's all in the Glass 100%.

44
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Rym: Basically, you just tap and say start biking and it just immediately starts counting down and it shows you your speed.

45
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:01,340
Rym: While you're biking and your time and all this stuff, it's great.

46
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:04,100
Rym: And you can still do other Glass stuff while it's running.

47
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:05,150
Rym: So I'm biking.

48
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:05,736
Rym: I'm biking.

49
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:06,100
Rym: I'm biking.

50
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:07,799
Rym: And I witnessed a car accident.

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,759
Rym: So I immediately turned on the video and took a bunch of pictures.

52
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,698
Scott: What kind of car accident?

53
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,240
Rym: So a Time Warner van just fucking smashed into this parked car and ripped the bummer.

54
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:21,100
Scott: So the car was parked and a Time Warner van just drove right into it?

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,663
Rym: Just like turned into it.

56
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,314
Rym: Just like crunch, crackle, crackle.

57
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:24,260
Scott: Huge noise.

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Scott: So it turned around a corner and just went right into it?

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,160
Rym: No, it just like tried to park and just fucking derped, I guess.

60
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,816
Scott: Oh, so it was trying to park and he stepped on the gas.

61
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:31,140
Scott: too much?

62
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:33,040
Rym: Yep, and he turned in too quick at speed.

63
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:36,800
Rym: And they get out of the car and they're kind of looking around.

64
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,460
Rym: And I decided, because I was videoing, I just go right over there and I look at his license plate.

65
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,939
Rym: So I have a good picture of it and I look at his face.

66
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,739
Scott: Detective Rym is on the case.

67
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,820
Rym: Well, because I do not like the fact that a lot of people do egregious shit in New York City or in just cities in general.

68
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,491
Scott: And get away with it.

69
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:54,860
Scott: Injustice.

70
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,239
Rym: I did not want them to get away with it.

71
00:02:57,501 --> 00:03:02,520
Rym: So on the off chance that they were going to flee the scene, I wanted to make sure I had video of that.

72
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:06,398
Rym: And then I waited like 15 minutes, the owner came down, "Look at the fuck, my

73
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:06,739
Rym: car!".

74
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:13,120
Rym: And then I exchanged contact info and I sent him all the pictures and video that I had and gave him a little deposition.

75
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,477
Rym: So he's good to go.

76
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:16,732
Rym: So that's what I did.

77
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:17,419
Rym: That was fun.

78
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,180
Rym: I was kind of, maybe it's wrong, I was hoping a little bit to see some sort of confrontation just so I'd have a better video.

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,759
Scott: So you could upload something to YouTube and get views.

80
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:27,510
Rym: Yeah.

81
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:28,709
Scott: That's right.

82
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,500
Scott: Get some Reddit karma.

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,578
Rym: But at the same time, I wonder if the fact that I was standing there and people were talking to me like, "Oh my god, is that Google Glass?

84
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:35,778
Rym: What's

85
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:35,919
Rym: up?"

86
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,560
Rym: That the fact that I was standing there and I was videoing everything.

87
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,240
Rym: I think if a conversation would have happened otherwise, it wouldn't because everyone was afraid of the camera.

88
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:48,840
Scott: Anyway.

89
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:52,072
Scott: So, the news action.

90
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:53,760
Scott: There's not a whole lot of news going on right now.

91
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:57,660
Scott: I'm sure there will be in a couple months, the San Diego Comic-Con, whatever.

92
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:00,119
Scott: But, at least comic animation news.

93
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,258
Scott: But check this out.

94
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:10,140
Scott: Drops of God, awesome manga that we love that got stopped publishing in English because I guess the Japanese company wasn't happy with how much it sold in the US.

95
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,980
Rym: Yeah, Japanese company, seriously, find an American vigner wine-brewed seller.

96
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,736
Scott: And then you made verticals skip a bunch of volumes, which no one cared.

97
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,692
Scott: That's the reason we...

98
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:25,679
Rym: You needed to cross-market that shit in... To kind of take Kazuo Koike's golf manga and put it in Golf Digest.

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,180
Rym: Take this thing, release it in floppies in wine stores.

100
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,220
Scott: So, I'm going to have to find some scanlations somewhere to finish reading this thing because I've got to know what the drops of God are.

101
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,760
Rym: So, Scott, when I was in France, I went to several wine tastings and I tasted a wide variety of Grand Cru.

102
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:39,784
Scott: Okay.

103
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,480
Scott: Did they taste like God dropped them?

104
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:42,198
Rym: Oh my god.

105
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:46,351
Scott: If they were in a different bottle, would you... And I just said, "Here's some

106
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:46,635
Scott: wine.".

107
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:51,500
Rym: So, the taste, because this was like a proper tasting, so I wasn't drunk or anything.

108
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:56,720
Rym: And unlike other tastings I've been to, later I was drunk.

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,720
Rym: But I did take tasting notes and I used that Vivino app that I use to take pictures of some of the bottles and everything.

110
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:09,900
Rym: What was interesting is in America, when I go to expensive or fancy wine tastings, they tend to tell you all the stuff about the wine and then have you drink it.

111
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:14,820
Rym: In France, they make you drink the wine without telling you shit.

112
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:16,579
Scott: Do they mix in shitty wines?

113
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,640
Rym: Not all the wines were good.

114
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,559
Rym: Then, they ask you what you think of it.

115
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,379
Rym: They ask you what you taste.

116
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,979
Rym: Then, they explain what the deal is with the wine.

117
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:27,999
Scott: Oh, how about that?

118
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,940
Scott: And you didn't get to see the bottle until after.

119
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,480
Rym: So, the sommelier is not coloring my perception of the wine.

120
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:33,882
Scott: Oh.

121
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,220
Rym: And the best wine...

122
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,959
Scott: Well, other than the fact that a sommelier gave it to you is coloring it.

123
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,860
Rym: Yeah, but some of the wines were kind of cheap and not that good.

124
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,759
Scott: Well, but the wines that you said that you liked happened to be the expensive ones.

125
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,136
Rym: The wines I liked the most were, every Grand Cru, my notes were, "This is the best

126
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:50,477
Rym: wine.".

127
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:52,229
Rym: Like, "This one stands

128
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:52,472
Rym: out.".

129
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:54,580
Scott: What made them stand out?

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,180
Rym: They were like the flavor.

131
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,086
Rym: Most wine, I guess...

132
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,580
Scott: This isn't really winning you any drops of God contest.

133
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,090
Rym: No, but I'm not great at differentiating wine.

134
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,398
Scott: I don't feel like I'm at a Queen concert right now.

135
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:13,620
Rym: So, in fact, there are studies that show that people who don't pay attention and study wine, a lot of times, they can't tell the difference between red and white wine if you blindfold them.

136
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:19,000
Rym: But when I drink wine, I like this wine, don't like that wine, like these kinds of wines.

137
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,700
Rym: I like Chianti's and Colorettes more than I like, Merlot's, that kind of thing.

138
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:31,500
Rym: But the differences, like the Grand Cru's, the flavors I tasted are flavors I just don't taste in the wine that I have at home.

139
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:32,335
Rym: Ah.

140
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,560
Rym: Like, there were flavors and notes that just aren't there that actually stood out.

141
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,987
Scott: What flavor?

142
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:39,311
Scott: is that?

143
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:40,080
Scott: Is it a good flavor?

144
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,519
Rym: So, one of them had this like really sort of like almost cherry flavor in there.

145
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:48,660
Rym: But usually when I get that kind of cherry flavor in a wine that I would buy.

146
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,059
Scott: Did someone dump sugar in it?

147
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:51,309
Rym: It's also really oaky.

148
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:52,540
Rym: Like it'll be oaky.

149
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,820
Scott: Because it was in an oak barrel.

150
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,401
Rym: Yeah.

151
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:56,620
Rym: So, this stuff, like the cherry was there.

152
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,700
Scott: Oh, cherry oak, I get it.

153
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,660
Rym: The cherry was there without the oak and I've never tasted that before.

154
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:02,580
Scott: Ah, so it's an oak barrel.

155
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,910
Rym: And in my tasting note, I was like, "Tastes like

156
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,412
Rym: cherry?".

157
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,100
Rym: Really tastes like cherry, period.

158
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,454
Rym: And then the sommelier was like, "You may have noticed notes of cherry.

159
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:13,439
Rym: That is what makes this wine

160
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:13,740
Rym: distinct.".

161
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,556
Rym: And I was like, "I fucking got this now,

162
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:15,980
Rym: bitches.".

163
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,743
Scott: It's a test.

164
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,092
Scott: You're trying to beat everyone else there.

165
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:21,360
Scott: You can't help but turn it into a contest.

166
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,242
Scott: No, you know what it was?

167
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:29,380
Rym: I just, I like wine a lot and it's really vindicating to say, like to think I taste something.

168
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:31,296
Rym: And then the expert is like, "Yes, that is what you

169
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:31,639
Rym: tasted.".

170
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:36,034
Scott: Anyway, so yeah, the manga in Japan is coming to an end.

171
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:37,980
Scott: So, as soon as that happens, I guess it's in June.

172
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,980
Rym: Just get a scandulation pack of the whole thing?

173
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,095
Scott: That's fucking a right.

174
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:43,752
Rym: Yeah, gonna find out what the drops of God are.

175
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:44,556
Rym: Don't read Wikipedia.

176
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:45,220
Rym: It spoils shit.

177
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,660
Scott: 100% gonna check out all them drops and not actually drink any of them.

178
00:07:49,880 --> 00:08:00,040
Rym: See, if someone were smart, I would take that manga, take all the kinds of wines and specific vineyards and everything that are mentioned in it and set up crazy cross promotions.

179
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:06,640
Scott: I would go and find one bottle of each of the apostles and the drops of God and sell it in a package.

180
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,589
Rym: For like 10 or 15 grand.

181
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,699
Scott: Right, one bottle of each, drops of God.

182
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,239
Rym: Well, except for the ones that you can't get.

183
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:13,599
Scott: I would get them.

184
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:14,479
Rym: You can't get them all.

185
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,479
Scott: It would be part of the package.

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,560
Scott: In fact, so what I learned in Paris is that a lot of the great wine- I'm still pretty sure the actual drops of God are gonna be something like water or the wine you make yourself at home with your own feet.

187
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:31,800
Rym: So a lot of the best wine I had in Paris, other than like the Grand Cru crazy stuff, was just fucking grocery store wine that cost like a euro.

188
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:39,240
Rym: A lot of the best wines, they're really great and they don't export it because it's like the cheap wine people drink every day with dinner.

189
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,852
Rym: So that wine can't be like hundreds of dollars.

190
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,380
Rym: So it's cheap, made locally.

191
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:49,000
Rym: It's not worth exporting and the demand internally is constant and high.

192
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:52,039
Rym: So all the cheapo grocery store wine is just really, really good.

193
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:55,140
Rym: Like here, cheapo grocery store wine tastes like shit.

194
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,245
Scott: Yeah, it's like why does the-?

195
00:08:57,345 --> 00:09:02,120
Scott: there's no law of the universe that says the best grapes have to be the most rare grapes, right?

196
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:10,420
Scott: It's like, what if I have the rare grape plant and the rare land, you know, the best grape plant, the best land, but I have a fuck ton of it.

197
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,760
Scott: It's like, oh, they're just- the best wine on earth happens to be a fuck ton of it.

198
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,800
Rym: Yeah, like a lot of the Grand Cru are like, this particular part of one vineyard just tastes different for reasons.

199
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,559
Rym: So only that counts.

200
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,940
Rym: So they can only make so many barrels of that.

201
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,080
Scott: Right, but what if there's like a million acres that taste like that?

202
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,922
Rym: Yeah, well you know what?

203
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:32,274
Rym: That's the kind of wine that everyone in France drinks with dinner every day.

204
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:34,040
Rym: that never gets exported outside of France.

205
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,940
Rym: Apparently people in Britain will like drive to France, fill their car with wine, and drive back to Britain.

206
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:43,720
Scott: Isn't there people like in the channel checking you?

207
00:09:44,443 --> 00:09:45,272
Rym: Yeah, don't get caught.

208
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,040
Rym: was what I was told.

209
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:46,920
Scott: Oh, okay.

210
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:56,860
Rym: So in other brief news, if you live in New York, Atlanta, Cambridge, Baltimore, Alexandria, Columbus, a bunch of other cities, Ghost in the Shell arrives.

211
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:58,748
Scott: It's not even a movie.

212
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:00,220
Scott: It's like OAV movie things.

213
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,270
Rym: Yeah, kind of like Stand Alone Complex was.

214
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,140
Rym: That was like pay-per-view originally.

215
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,280
Scott: Well, Stand Alone Complex, Solid State Society was OAV.

216
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,720
Rym: Yeah, so the first two are just being screened in movie theaters and you can buy tickets.

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,300
Scott: But I kind of wanted to wait until they were all done before I watched them.

218
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,860
Rym: I did, but at the same time I kind of really want to see more Ghost in the Shell.

219
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:19,700
Scott: In a movie theater.

220
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,620
Rym: Because I like Silver Spoon, I like Jo-Up Petal.

221
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,620
Scott: Did you watch Silver Spoon?

222
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,379
Rym: I didn't finish the first season.

223
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:28,119
Rym: Okay, I finished the whole thing.

224
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:37,720
Rym: But shows that give me that feels, that fuck yeah feels, Kill La Kill did that, Ghost in the Shell did that.

225
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,979
Scott: Who knows if Arise will do that.

226
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:40,420
Rym: I have a feeling it will.

227
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,499
Scott: You're willing to pay to find out?

228
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:42,740
Rym: I'm willing to pay to find out.

229
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,640
Scott: Similarly, other situations, Gundam Unicorn UC is almost done, the last episode.

230
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:48,975
Rym: Oh shit.

231
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,566
Scott: Which means then that's another one.

232
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:51,552
Scott: I watched none of that.

233
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:52,980
Scott: I'm going to watch all of as soon as it's complete.

234
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,020
Rym: Maybe we should watch it together and just do straight up episodes on it.

235
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,514
Scott: We could do that.

236
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:01,420
Scott: And then I guess those Evangelion movies at some point.

237
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:01,858
Scott: Oh yeah.

238
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,580
Scott: Will be all done.

239
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,620
Rym: I'm waiting until they're all, all, all done.

240
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,500
Scott: Yeah, I'm waiting for, you know, 10.1010, you will not watch this again.

241
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,238
Scott: We cannot remake.

242
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:20,024
Scott: 8, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10.

243
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:20,517
Scott: End of Anno.

244
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,379
Scott: It's just a video of his funeral.

245
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:26,359
Scott: He died of smoking too much.

246
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,520
Rym: Maybe what we should do is when they're finally done, let's just marathon the whole goddamn thing.

247
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:30,999
Scott: That's right.

248
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,310
Rym: So things of the day.

249
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,930
Rym: There's a movie, you know, we're talking about anime, it's anime day.

250
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:47,650
Rym: The first anime I ever saw when I was in fourth grade.

251
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,590
Scott: How many times are you going to talk?

252
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,930
Rym: And my little brother was too.

253
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,219
Rym: So my brother was so much lately.

254
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,050
Scott: Maybe we should watch it and do a show on it.

255
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,587
Rym: I kind of want to.

256
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,896
Rym: So that's what I think of.

257
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:58,410
Rym: the day is when my little brother was six and I was eight.

258
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:04,670
Rym: My parents made us watch vampire hundred D the dub, that dub, the dub that I watched.

259
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,270
Rym: The first anime I ever saw in its entirety is just on YouTube.

260
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:09,006
Scott: Yeah.

261
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:19,210
Rym: So, uh, if you want to see what a very young Rym and his young brother watched and decided anime was our fucking thing, it was this.

262
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,290
Rym: When I was eight, this was the greatest thing I had ever seen in my entire life.

263
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,330
Rym: I dressed up as D for Halloween.

264
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,908
Rym: Nobody fucking knew what that was.

265
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:30,330
Rym: Except my mom and my dad, my brother.

266
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,629
Scott: Let's get a picture of that on the internet.

267
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:33,709
Rym: I should try to find a picture of that.

268
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,590
Scott: Anyway, so my thing of the day.

269
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:40,530
Scott: I don't know how many of you are familiar with the on beastie boys, right?

270
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:41,168
Scott: Better be.

271
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:41,759
Scott: Yeah.

272
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:45,370
Scott: Uh, you may also know that MCA, right?

273
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,409
Scott: Adam passed away with two years ago.

274
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:48,405
Scott: Something like that.

275
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,877
Scott: Yeah.

276
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,690
Scott: On May the fourth, which is I guess inconvenient.

277
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:55,410
Scott: I would not want to die on a day associated with the silly star Wars holiday.

278
00:12:55,971 --> 00:13:00,544
Rym: I'd much rather die on yell at the sky day, international day of Slayer, something like that.

279
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,990
Scott: But anyway, around that time every year, uh, they have an event known as MCA day to celebrate him.

280
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:13,274
Scott: And I hope one day that I am celebrated so that my, the anniversary of my death is a day.

281
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:22,497
Scott: But anyway, he was known in his life, you know, not just for the music he created, but he was a huge, like.

282
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:25,070
Scott: his thing was free Tibet, right?

283
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:25,868
Scott: That was his thing.

284
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:28,450
Scott: The way that free the internet is our thing, right?

285
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:34,110
Scott: He was actually, you know, a Tibetan Buddhist himself and you know, he was friends, all these Tibetan Buddhist people.

286
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,229
Scott: That was his, his jam.

287
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:43,290
Scott: So on MCA day, some Tibetan Buddhist monks honored him with some awesome breakdancing.

288
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,370
Rym: They honored him in the way that he should be honored.

289
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:45,969
Scott: That is right.

290
00:13:46,412 --> 00:13:48,250
Scott: So that's just fucking awesome.

291
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:50,430
Scott: And it's awesome shit that happens in New York.

292
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:51,629
Scott: So watch this goddamn video.

293
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,100
Scott: Oh man.

294
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,709
Rym: In the meta moment forums, we got them.

295
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:55,630
Rym: They're rocking.

296
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:56,669
Rym: They're awesome.

297
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:59,490
Rym: If you don't use good spelling and grammar, we'll fucking ban you.

298
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,409
Rym: That's how awesome they are.

299
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:00,700
Scott: Yeah.

300
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,110
Scott: We have IRC channel.

301
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,429
Scott: Like people are getting in it.

302
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:04,670
Scott: We even have a newsletter.

303
00:14:04,772 --> 00:14:05,449
Scott: I sent it out.

304
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,430
Scott: We have, what else do we have?

305
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:16,230
Scott: We have lots of videos of all our panels and lectures on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Google plus, and maybe even Twitch and all the places on the internet.

306
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,407
Scott: We are there.

307
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:22,410
Rym: If you like our shit, spread our shit around, share our shit with other people.

308
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,949
Rym: The more you spread it around and the more people like it, the more we'll do.

309
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,766
Rym: You know, if you young kids don't realize we've been doing GeekNights for almost 10 years.

310
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,750
Rym: For many years, we did four fucking episodes a week.

311
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:38,769
Scott: If you spread our shit, maybe one day we'll just get lucky and hit that pot of gold and we can just do this all the time.

312
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,150
Scott: Yeah.

313
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,030
Rym: You want us to make 12 episodes a week?

314
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,302
Rym: Sure.

315
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,449
Rym: You want us to make video games?

316
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:42,806
Rym: Yeah.

317
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:43,337
Scott: Yeah.

318
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,350
Scott: We can do all kinds of stuff if maybe someone with a lot of money likes us someday.

319
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,750
Scott: The book club selection is Canicle for Leibowitz.

320
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,930
Scott: You should buy that and read it because I've seen it mentioned in like so many places.

321
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,949
Scott: I have to check it out.

322
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,302
Rym: Yep.

323
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,750
Rym: Also, you should look at the rest of the GeekNights book club.

324
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,769
Rym: We've done a bunch of books.

325
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:07,610
Rym: They're not all awesome, but they're all worth reading for one reason or another, except the King Killer Chronicle.

326
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,989
Rym: Don't read that one.

327
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:15,030
Rym: I cannot express to you how rustled my fucking jimmies are about that book.

328
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,226
Scott: You just can't get over it.

329
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,630
Rym: It did rustle me and it continues to rustle me.

330
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,390
Scott: You should make your next selection something so bad.

331
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,929
Rym: That it'll wash it out?

332
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:25,369
Rym: Alright, Scott.

333
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:26,749
Rym: Atlas Shrugged.

334
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:27,786
Scott: Go for it.

335
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,090
Rym: Have you read Atlas Shrugged?

336
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:29,388
Scott: No.

337
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:32,510
Rym: Yeah, I think Atlas Shrugged is worse.

338
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:33,589
Rym: Maybe.

339
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,421
Rym: I don't know.

340
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,342
Scott: Ulysses.

341
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,929
Rym: I'll read Ulysses.

342
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:37,423
Scott: No.

343
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:38,528
Rym: No, you won't.

344
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,468
Scott: I don't have time for that.

345
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,650
Rym: You're going to break the book club?

346
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,192
Rym: Ain't?

347
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:42,308
Scott: no one got time for that.

348
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:44,548
Rym: Ethan Frome.

349
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:46,008
Scott: I already read that.

350
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:47,469
Rym: I've actually never read it.

351
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,009
Scott: Guy rides a sled down a hill, dies.

352
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,488
Scott: The end.

353
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:50,350
Rym: He doesn't die.

354
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:50,929
Rym: Spoilers.

355
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:52,270
Rym: He doesn't die.

356
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,290
Rym: That's the point.

357
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,530
Scott: I read it in like, I don't know, sixth grade.

358
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,350
Scott: What the fuck do I remember?

359
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:57,929
Scott: I can't even remember Adventure Time.

360
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,869
Scott: I watched it last year.

361
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:02,069
Rym: That he wants to commit suicide on a sled and fucks that up.

362
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,909
Rym: And it makes everything worse.

363
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,089
Scott: And you're the one who hasn't read the book?

364
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:05,810
Rym: Yeah.

365
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,830
Rym: I read excerpts from it for class in like high school.

366
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:11,030
Scott: Okay.

367
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:11,528
Scott: Anyway.

368
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,370
Rym: Adventure Time.

369
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:17,270
Rym: So we've been watching Adventure Time for a long time, as you guys know.

370
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,048
Scott: Yeah, and we already did an episode on it.

371
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,230
Scott: So why would we talk about it again?

372
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:28,670
Rym: Well, I guess we could turn into Anime Pulse and just review every episode of every show we watch as it comes out and not talk about anything else.

373
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,808
Scott: That's someone else's job.

374
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,490
Rym: Anime Pulse's job, apparently.

375
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,997
Scott: Sure.

376
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:39,550
Rym: But no, I think Adventure Time warrants a little more discussion since a lot, the show's done a lot since we first watched it.

377
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:45,809
Rym: And while our reviews were pretty on point, what we didn't do is kind of talk about where it's going and all that kind of stuff.

378
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:47,550
Rym: Kind of like an ongoing review.

379
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,289
Rym: I mean, it's hard to say, oh, we've reviewed, you know, Space Dandy because there's only one season.

380
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,050
Rym: There might be more stuff.

381
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,689
Rym: Imagine if Space Dandy had 50 seasons.

382
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,930
Scott: It's sort of impossible.

383
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,990
Scott: How do you review something?

384
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:01,809
Scott: It's like when something is a single item, it's easy to review, but when it goes on forever, how do you even do that?

385
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,089
Rym: Well, you do it by, I guess, story arc you could review.

386
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,046
Rym: You could do it by...

387
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,689
Scott: You got to break it into some sort of item.

388
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:07,244
Rym: Yep.

389
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:13,150
Scott: But anyway, since there's so much freaking Adventure Time and I only watched every episode once and my memory is awful, right?

390
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,249
Scott: We called our friend Adventure Time expert Judith to come and help us talk about Adventure Time.

391
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:18,869
Scott: Hello.

392
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,230
Rym: Judith is pretty much the most expert at Adventure Time that we know.

393
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:23,069
Scott: Also Pokemon.

394
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:23,477
Rym: Yeah.

395
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,829
Rym: In fact, I think I scheduled her to do an Adventure Time panel at ConnectiCon.

396
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:28,148
Scott: Oh, how about that?

397
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,750
Rym: It was either that or one of the 19 Ask a Homestuck panels that got submitted.

398
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:41,370
Scott: So are you telling me that ConnectiCon, a relatively smaller convention in Hartford, Connecticut, where no one ever wants to go, has a better Adventure Time panel than every other convention ever?

399
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:43,330
Rym: It might have the best one that's ever happened.

400
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:44,029
Scott: That's crazy.

401
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:44,850
Scott: No pressure.

402
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:46,570
Rym: Don't worry.

403
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,310
Rym: We'll just video it and livestream it on the internet.

404
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:48,889
Rym: Oh, alright.

405
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:49,989
Rym: That's fine.

406
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:56,048
Rym: So the only thing I'll warn you guys about is kind of good to spoil stuff, because we're just going to talk about the show.

407
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,670
Rym: So if you really care about spoilers in Adventure Time, I would suggest watching Adventure Time.

408
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,409
Rym: The episodes are not long.

409
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:07,869
Scott: The number of episodes, it doesn't take long to watch all of it.

410
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,370
Rym: Well, I remember when I thought, oh, I'll watch Adventure Time.

411
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,469
Rym: Everyone's talking about it.

412
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,489
Rym: I feel like I'm left out by not watching it.

413
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,868
Rym: And then I saw there's like a bajillion episodes, and that was back when there were only like three seasons.

414
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,175
Rym: Yeah.

415
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:24,250
Scott: Alright, so should we begin with the recent events that are on everyone's mind?

416
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,110
Rym: So Finn finally lost his fucking arm.

417
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,769
Scott: Saw that coming so far away.

418
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:29,209
Guest: Everybody did though.

419
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,249
Rym: Did everyone.

420
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,110
Rym: The internet did not seem to see that coming.

421
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,889
Guest: It was only foreshadowed like hell.

422
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:36,490
Rym: Two smart people.

423
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,269
Rym: It was Chekhov's arm.

424
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,390
Rym: I mean, I remember when I noticed that it wasn't until the alternate reality world.

425
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,630
Scott: Where you had the metal arm and the farm and shit.

426
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:47,929
Rym: And then was it Puhoy?

427
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:51,769
Rym: Was that the episode where you met the cloud people and had sex with them and then made cloud babies?

428
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,888
Guest: Yeah, and he got a pillow arm.

429
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:53,850
Rym: Yep.

430
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:56,708
Rym: And that was when I noticed that there was a trend of...

431
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,687
Scott: I forgot all about that.

432
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,628
Rym: You forgot about that?

433
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,389
Scott: I forgot about that.

434
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,610
Rym: I watched that episode a couple of times because I'd keep seeing the title and be like, "Puhoy?

435
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:03,705
Rym: The fuck was that

436
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:03,950
Rym: episode?".

437
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:06,610
Scott: I'll have to go back and rewatch that one.

438
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,950
Rym: Do you remember why it's called Puhoy?

439
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:09,528
Scott: No.

440
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,770
Rym: That's just what cloud people... Or cloud people.

441
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,929
Rym: That's what pillow people say.

442
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,490
Scott: Oh, pillow people.

443
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:17,870
Scott: Oh, now I don't remember even more than just cloud people.

444
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:20,270
Rym: I kept saying cloud people because there are cloud people.

445
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:21,450
Rym: We saw one.

446
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:22,307
Scott: Is it just me?

447
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:26,930
Scott: People always talk about how Adventure Time is one of those shows that's on multiple levels.

448
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,290
Scott: The adult sees this and the kid sees that, right?

449
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,942
Scott: But it feels like, especially that newest episode, The Tower, it's 100% adult.

450
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:36,910
Rym: Not just the newest episode.

451
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,890
Rym: The latter half of this season has been pretty much since Finn blew it with Flame Princess.

452
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:49,070
Scott: What does a kid get out of watching The Tower or the episode with Prismo and whatnot?

453
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:53,190
Guest: I kind of agree with you on that one, especially since the start of season six.

454
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,603
Guest: I was watching it and thinking, "This is not for

455
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:56,026
Guest: children.".

456
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:57,694
Rym: Could we say that?

457
00:19:57,734 --> 00:20:03,449
Rym: maybe, as you've noticed, Finn is aging at about the rate that the show is coming out, so he's getting older.

458
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,830
Scott: But no one else is because everyone else is magical?

459
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,090
Rym: It's Oz World.

460
00:20:07,691 --> 00:20:09,189
Rym: Ozma of Oz does not age.

461
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:10,410
Scott: Sure.

462
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,388
Rym: Just like Peebs.

463
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,529
Rym: People don't age in that world.

464
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,370
Rym: So Finn's getting older.

465
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,010
Rym: Maybe the audience is just getting older at the same rate?

466
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:19,810
Scott: But everyone else has an excuse for not aging, right?

467
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:25,690
Scott: It's like Jake is a magical dog guy and Princess Bubblegum is made of gum, but Finn is a human.

468
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,770
Rym: With apparently ultra psychic powers.

469
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,130
Scott: He's not a hot dog princess or a lumpy space princess.

470
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:32,890
Rym: So thus he's aging.

471
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,010
Scott: Yeah, and no one else is aging because everyone else is a talking pig or some shit.

472
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:38,250
Guest: Jake's getting older.

473
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:40,430
Guest: It's just harder to see because he's not going through puberty.

474
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,449
Guest: He apparently already did.

475
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,356
Rym: Yeah, he's like 30.

476
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:44,189
Guest: He's gaining a lot of weight.

477
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,510
Scott: Jake's supposed to be way older than Finn, though, right?

478
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,508
Scott: He's like a middle aged dude.

479
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:49,570
Rym: That might just be of mind because of dog years.

480
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,389
Guest: Yeah, it is.

481
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,706
Rym: I pretty much always assume that.

482
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,610
Scott: So Jonathan was actually kind of young, is that what you're saying?

483
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,427
Rym: Well, Jonathan, I think he died in like his late 40s.

484
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,270
Guest: You mean Joshua?

485
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,510
Scott: Joshua, right?

486
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:04,510
Rym: Okay.

487
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,984
Rym: Way to go.

488
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:06,782
Guest: I told you my memory's awful.

489
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,425
Scott: That's why we needed you here.

490
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:11,950
Rym: But so we don't need an excuse.

491
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,350
Rym: That's why Finn's aging.

492
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,670
Rym: So maybe just the target demographic of the show is aging with Finn.

493
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,889
Rym: I mean, a 14 year old could learn about revenge.

494
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,109
Scott: So the show is what, five, six years old?

495
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:25,649
Guest: Something like that.

496
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,489
Scott: Something like that?

497
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:26,770
Scott: Okay.

498
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,589
Guest: Don't ask me numbers.

499
00:21:29,273 --> 00:21:30,969
Scott: I'll actually look it up because that is somewhat interesting.

500
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,550
Rym: The pilot was in 2007.

501
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,882
Rym: The first season was in 2010.

502
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:35,070
Scott: All right.

503
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,550
Scott: So the actual show, because you know, the only people who saw that pilot were people like us, right?

504
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,029
Scott: On the YouTube.

505
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,530
Rym: I remember we watched that on YouTube.

506
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,510
Rym: It was one of the first videos we saw on YouTube.

507
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:44,530
Scott: Um, but yeah.

508
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,050
Scott: So, okay.

509
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,549
Scott: So it was like four or five years old.

510
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,529
Scott: So I guess how old would like an eight year old would start watching it.

511
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,110
Scott: And now they're 13.

512
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,330
Rym: I'm pretty sure it was 10 to 12 year olds even at the beginning.

513
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:54,270
Scott: Maybe.

514
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,629
Scott: But you know, I guess that can make sense.

515
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,650
Rym: Finn was not eight years old in season one.

516
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,830
Scott: Like a four or five year old wasn't watching it, right?

517
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:00,951
Scott: In 2010.

518
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:01,306
Scott: Yeah.

519
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,702
Rym: The demographic seemed to be 10 year olds and 30 year olds.

520
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:07,110
Scott: All right.

521
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,689
Scott: It's like, I guess that can make sense to the people who are now in their young teens who started watching it then, even though it's only been a handful of years.

522
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:30,946
Rym: But partly I've, I've kind of noticed, I don't know if you guys agree, but the show every season has had a, an arc where the very, after the first season where the beginning is just resolving the previous season stuff and it's super serious, then it's a bunch of unrelated funny stuff and then all the Chekhov guns build up and then they all blow up at the end of the season and suddenly it gets all adult again.

523
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,510
Scott: Pony does the same thing.

524
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,489
Scott: They put their plot episodes at the beginning and the end.

525
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,550
Rym: Don't use that word with those people anymore.

526
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,550
Scott: For the season premiere and the season finales.

527
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:42,409
Scott: And then all the middle episodes are just fillers.

528
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,990
Rym: Not the same way that the Chekhov's gun in Pony is like Chekhov party poppers.

529
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:53,130
Scott: I'm not saying that, I'm just saying this, the same model of, you know, because they have seasons of shows, right?

530
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,046
Scott: They put all the big episodes as season premieres and finales cause.

531
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:56,730
Scott: that's the big deal.

532
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:57,868
Scott: Even South Park doesn't.

533
00:22:58,051 --> 00:22:59,730
Scott: Yeah, at least the US shows.

534
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,330
Guest: Yeah, but if we're talking about like a range of darkness, then I would say adventure time.

535
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,070
Guest: season six and five had extremely dark starts.

536
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:08,570
Rym: Yeah, definitely.

537
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,229
Rym: Of course then again, well let's see.

538
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,930
Rym: So season two ended with heat signature and the flame princess stuff.

539
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,128
Scott: That's that long ago?

540
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,140
Scott: Whoa.

541
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,369
Rym: Mortal recoil, mortal folly.

542
00:23:20,871 --> 00:23:21,949
Guest: That was the end of season two.

543
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,139
Scott: That feels way more recent than the mortal.

544
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,189
Guest: real recoil stuff was the end of season two.

545
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:30,230
Guest: I believe flame princess's introduction was the end of season three.

546
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:30,908
Scott: Oh, okay.

547
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,588
Scott: Let's see.

548
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,227
Scott: I was going to say.

549
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,110
Rym: Yep, incendium, incendium as opposed to heat signature.

550
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:37,642
Rym: It feels like flame princess came in way later, right?

551
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,838
Rym: But I think when the show first hit his real dark notes that were obvious was the whole alternate reality.

552
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,270
Rym: fin wakes up as a human after making the wish.

553
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,909
Rym: Like that shit was kind of creepy.

554
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:53,270
Guest: That was the most blatantly dark, but there were some darker seeds before that for sure.

555
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:56,150
Rym: There were, but they could be written off by a child.

556
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:56,790
Rym: True.

557
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,150
Rym: Like a child could just kind of go, whatever, not notice.

558
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:05,669
Rym: Like you could kind of write those off as the, those elements that are in children's movies that are kind of just brushed aside before the end happens.

559
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:09,670
Guest: You always had this safe, fantastical adventure time world to retreat to.

560
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,329
Guest: It would always go back to the status quo.

561
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:17,110
Guest: And even though it did, after the season five premiere, there was still kind of an uncomfortable feeling leftover.

562
00:24:17,694 --> 00:24:17,926
Rym: Yeah.

563
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,207
Rym: Cause it kind of showed you this other world and what could have been, and it was just horrible.

564
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,630
Rym: Like really, really horrible.

565
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,990
Rym: And you start to realize that Jake's not the most responsible person.

566
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:30,890
Guest: That was kind of obvious.

567
00:24:32,532 --> 00:24:36,410
Rym: I just remember when he's watching the video of what's going on in Finn's alternate reality.

568
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,849
Rym: He's kind of like, yeah, he's got this whatevs.

569
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,530
Scott: I think Jake is just sort of like, it's really inconsistent and all over the place.

570
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,848
Scott: Like if you watch the episode just now, right?

571
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:51,330
Scott: The tower, he was relatively stable and you know, in control other than supporting Finn's crazy idea to build the tower.

572
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,870
Rym: Are you thinking of the episode where they're in, they're trapped in the sand kingdom?

573
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,990
Guest: Oh, he was that guy in that episode.

574
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,189
Rym: He's just a that guy fuck up in that episode.

575
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,710
Scott: Right.

576
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:07,870
Scott: It's like, you know, sometimes it'll be like an adult and other times he will totally be the most dangerous possible person to be around.

577
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:14,790
Guest: Sometimes he'll give terrible advice, but with the utmost of confidence and young Finn will be like, oh yeah, yeah, let's just do that.

578
00:25:15,032 --> 00:25:15,830
Rym: Listen to your Mellenhart.

579
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,309
Rym: Mellenhart's telling me to kill my dad.

580
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:19,350
Rym: Yeah, it's not your Mellenhart.

581
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:19,855
Scott: See?

582
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,269
Scott: That's the responsible Jake.

583
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,990
Rym: Except I think that was his Mellenhart.

584
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:24,510
Scott: Probably.

585
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:42,190
Rym: But it really, the moment the show got it, I don't want to say it got sexual, but kind of do because it was honestly that episode that led up to you blew it man with flame princess because there is no way to cast that episode as anything other than puberty.

586
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,090
Guest: Oh yeah.

587
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:51,349
Scott: I mean those dreams, the one where he's wriggling around in his little, uh, his pants are on fire and he loves it.

588
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:51,850
Rym: Yep.

589
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:52,870
Rym: This feels great.

590
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:58,486
Rym: And then he's trying to recreate that feeling and then in doing so he pushes away the only girl who ever probably loved him.

591
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:00,328
Rym: You blew it, man.

592
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,789
Rym: Granted, I think the cosmic owl was being kind of a dick there.

593
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:03,784
Rym: Could've just told him.

594
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,590
Scott: And then when you know, it's cosmic owl is weird too.

595
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:16,250
Scott: It's like he seems so mysterious, but now that you've seen some mysterious and then he's just like hanging out in like the hot tub at Prismo's place and it's like, his job seems to be to, uh, there's drama going on here.

596
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:16,746
Rym: I'm out of here.

597
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:17,278
Rym: See ya.

598
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,430
Scott: I mean, princess Luna is more responsible than my cosmic owl.

599
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:27,402
Rym: All Luna does is just watch everyone's dreams and then she helps them out and intervene in them.

600
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,170
Scott: She's doing the cosmic owl's job right.

601
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,610
Scott: That's what the cosmic owl should be doing.

602
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,350
Guest: That's really creepy.

603
00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:33,229
Rym: Yeah, but she is.

604
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:38,530
Rym: I mean, she's straight up watching people's dreams and then she doesn't even stop Sweetie Belle from doing her bullshit.

605
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,606
Rym: She lets her do it and then she tells her wrong.

606
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:40,969
Scott: show guys.

607
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:44,048
Scott: I know it's my fault, but seriously, it always is.

608
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:54,468
Rym: But from that moment, I mean, if we look at the list of episodes in season five and six, especially season six, I mean, let's see, we've got, oh my God, there's a lot of episodes in season five.

609
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,289
Rym: So Finn, the human Jake, the dog, that was, that was kind of serious.

610
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:02,149
Rym: Uh, Pahoy had those elements.

611
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:08,026
Rym: Simon and Marcy, there's been a lot of those episodes lately and they just go full on in now.

612
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:09,370
Rym: They don't dance around.

613
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,330
Rym: They don't leave anything ambiguous.

614
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:12,529
Rym: They're like, let's explore this world some more.

615
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:16,209
Rym: Oh, look at this exact flashback of what happened back then.

616
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:18,549
Guest: What else is there to hide now?

617
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:22,166
Guest: We know what happened, kind of mostly true, but notice how.

618
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:23,750
Rym: in the old days they'd hinted these things.

619
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,929
Rym: They'd give you vignettes, they'd give you little flashes and ideas, but then they sort of transitioned into this.

620
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:36,130
Rym: Let's just have a long running flashback that tells all and kind of assume that all the other characters now couldn't keep up those hints forever.

621
00:27:36,484 --> 00:27:36,610
Scott: Right?

622
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:43,790
Scott: Well, that's the thing that I'm seeing now is they're facing all the Chekhov's guns are firing and all the, they're all empty, like there's nothing else to fire.

623
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:49,289
Scott: What are they going to possibly add more to other than just rolling the things that they've already got forward?

624
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:49,849
Guest: I don't know.

625
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,206
Guest: Flame Princess is still a powder keg.

626
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,003
Scott: Sure.

627
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:53,129
Rym: Well, yeah.

628
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:58,808
Rym: And they haven't really resolved any of that, even though honestly it fins the state up until now.

629
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,830
Rym: I think Cinnamon Bun's a better person for her to be with, a little more stable and adult.

630
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,670
Guest: I seriously don't think that's romantic though.

631
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:05,186
Rym: No.

632
00:28:05,578 --> 00:28:05,749
Rym: No.

633
00:28:06,313 --> 00:28:07,250
Guest: If that's what you're implying.

634
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:15,269
Rym: How would that possibly, that'd be, it's like, yeah, yeah, because that's any less plausible than a human boy and fire.

635
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:19,929
Scott: It's at least got more merit than a flammable big good.

636
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,630
Rym: Plus, I mean, the world is mostly candy people and monsters.

637
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:28,887
Scott: It's this area of ooh.

638
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,109
Rym: Most of the world is monsters then.

639
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,970
Scott: But I mean, there's other dimensions, right?

640
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,110
Scott: It's like, where, you know, the hell place where Marceline's dad lives.

641
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,290
Guest: There's infinite dimensions.

642
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,669
Guest: They established that a long time ago.

643
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,346
Scott: That's true.

644
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,589
Scott: When is that established?

645
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:42,350
Guest: The first time Prisma was introduced.

646
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,930
Scott: Oh, he says there's infinity dimensions.

647
00:28:44,151 --> 00:28:48,990
Guest: The little keeper guy introduces them to that in this really, really fast spoken monologue.

648
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,390
Rym: With the whole Enchiridion thing.

649
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,669
Guest: You have to listen to it a lot.

650
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:52,937
Rym: I take it.

651
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:53,910
Rym: you've watched that part.

652
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,548
Scott: I've listened to it once.

653
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,070
Scott: Over an hour.

654
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,730
Rym: I've watched those episodes a bunch of times.

655
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,988
Guest: I've watched it like three or four times.

656
00:28:59,276 --> 00:28:59,426
Scott: Okay.

657
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:00,549
Guest: It's 11 minutes long.

658
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,508
Scott: I'll just trust you then.

659
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,509
Scott: Because I have no choice but not to do so.

660
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,490
Rym: But we had like the two part Lemon Hopper, which seemed to just be about internet libertarians.

661
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,830
Scott: I love that at Lemon Hope.

662
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:15,329
Rym: At the wedding, we learned just how creepy tree trunks really is.

663
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:22,069
Scott: For some reason, the whole lemon situation, when it first appeared, it's just like, shut up lemons.

664
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:24,269
Scott: Never appear again in this show.

665
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,269
Rym: I love lemons.

666
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,790
Scott: It's just like, why isn't this a lemon episode?

667
00:29:28,472 --> 00:29:30,170
Guest: I love lemon grab after his first appearance.

668
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,090
Guest: He was hilarious.

669
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,950
Scott: I meant the first appearance of any lemons whatsoever.

670
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,389
Rym: Well, Scott, you were the same way with LSP.

671
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:36,850
Rym: You were like, oh my God, I hate this character.

672
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,129
Scott: No, LSP from the beginning was like, oh my God.

673
00:29:45,214 --> 00:29:46,910
Rym: I remember I was using LSP as an example.

674
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,689
Rym: We were at a con.

675
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,589
Rym: It was like an anime Boston.

676
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,950
Rym: You weren't watching Adventure Time yet.

677
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,750
Rym: And I was like, you saw an LSP and you were like, what's that thing?

678
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:54,330
Rym: It's really cute.

679
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,221
Rym: And I was like, you're going to watch Adventure Time someday and you're going to really hate what that thing is.

680
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:03,170
Scott: It's definitely not cute, but it's still the best thing.

681
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,950
Rym: But they've left Betty unresolved, Flame Princess unresolved.

682
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,270
Rym: Rattleballs is out there.

683
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:08,990
Rym: He could do something.

684
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:09,983
Scott: Sure.

685
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:13,410
Scott: So it's like the Chekhov's guns are just characters that happen to exist.

686
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,310
Scott: That's like saying that in The Simpsons, Moe is a Chekhov's gun because he hasn't been.

687
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:23,689
Rym: These are characters that exist, interacted with the main characters and have still unresolved issues.

688
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:30,549
Guest: I thought Rattleballs was going to be the one to provide Finn with a new arm since his arm kind of looks like the one that Finn has been depicted with.

689
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,929
Scott: Look who's looking at the details there.

690
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,970
Rym: While that might be true, every reality where Finn has lost his arm, he has gotten a different arm.

691
00:30:39,051 --> 00:30:41,910
Rym: I don't think he can get the same kind of arm in two places.

692
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,970
Guest: I'm not going to confirm or deny that.

693
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,647
Guest: I have no idea.

694
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:47,930
Rym: That's just my theory.

695
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:50,590
Rym: I feel like every version of Finn has a different arm.

696
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,590
Guest: Well, Rattleballs was thrown into the mix for a reason.

697
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,110
Guest: Maybe they haven't come up with it yet, but definitely for a reason.

698
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,730
Scott: Let's talk about this arm though, right?

699
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,810
Scott: So he had the leaf sword, the grass sword, right?

700
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:05,849
Rym: Well, that episode alone, that episode had all appearances of being a throwaway episode and got serious real quick.

701
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:06,307
Scott: Yeah.

702
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:10,269
Scott: With my favorite character, choose Goose, who needs to show up more often.

703
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:12,430
Rym: I thought LSP was your favorite character.

704
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:13,247
Scott: Also choose Goose.

705
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,710
Guest: LSP is better.

706
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:17,290
Scott: Anyway, so he gets the leaf arm, right?

707
00:31:17,532 --> 00:31:17,929
Scott: The sword.

708
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:19,007
Scott: Then he's cool with it.

709
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,419
Scott: Yep.

710
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:19,810
Scott: Right?

711
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,749
Scott: Then it basically, when he needs to use it, it devours his whole arm and pops off.

712
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:26,070
Scott: And then the magic goop, right?

713
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:30,850
Scott: That I guess that goop was keeping people alive and stable and unaging for long periods.

714
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,048
Rym: Well, that goop is a perfect heal-all.

715
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,793
Rym: It heals anything 100%.

716
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:34,050
Rym: Yeah.

717
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:34,410
Scott: Right.

718
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,790
Scott: So it healed his arm into this flower.

719
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,130
Rym: Well, it healed it back into the flower.

720
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,930
Rym: So that means that his arm's essence was replaced by that cursed plant.

721
00:31:42,138 --> 00:31:42,290
Scott: Sure.

722
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,545
Scott: Now, if he gets more goop somehow, would the flower grow even more?

723
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:47,430
Scott: or is that the max for that flower?

724
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,970
Rym: I think it's going to grow back into a flower.

725
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,170
Guest: It looked like the goop healed the sword and not the human arm.

726
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:53,269
Scott: That's right.

727
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,330
Rym: So the sword should grow back into a proper sword, I guess.

728
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,370
Scott: Is he going to maybe have a plant arm eventually if it keeps growing?

729
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,050
Scott: Is he giving it enough water and sunlight?

730
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:01,828
Scott: You know.

731
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:03,770
Guest: Well, where would he give water?

732
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,488
Guest: Just sweat on it?

733
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:05,129
Scott: I guess.

734
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,565
Scott: I don't know.

735
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,770
Rym: Dip it in water occasionally?

736
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,469
Scott: Drink the water?

737
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:09,250
Scott: It's got roots probably in his upper arm.

738
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:09,710
Guest: It's magic.

739
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,729
Guest: It probably doesn't need any of that.

740
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,189
Scott: Why doesn't he go ask some wizards about it or some shit?

741
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:14,150
Rym: You know, it's kind of a aside.

742
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,005
Rym: You know what that arm reminded me of a lot?

743
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,468
Rym: And I thought about this.

744
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:17,986
Rym: Dajan.

745
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:25,970
Rym: That whole episode with the cursed arm reminded me of Dajan and the feather just because that arm is kind of wicked powerful.

746
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:28,689
Scott: Well, now it's not.

747
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:29,726
Scott: Or maybe it still is.

748
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:30,270
Scott: Nah.

749
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:30,667
Scott: Right.

750
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,950
Rym: But actually.

751
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:45,390
Rym: So the mechanical arm he had in his previous life as that awesome thief girl is similar to the arm he had in the alternate reality where he becomes the Ice King and fights Jake the Lich.

752
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:46,463
Guest: Yeah.

753
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,509
Guest: I thought all of his mechanical arms at least looked a little bit smaller.

754
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:58,550
Rym: But they are distinctly different in that the human, Finn the human arm has two bits and two bits and a sort of like and the joint is different.

755
00:32:58,914 --> 00:33:00,210
Rym: But the grabbers the same.

756
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,970
Scott: It's a. it's a metal arm of the grabber.

757
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,209
Scott: Go find a picture of Rattleballs and let's check his arms out.

758
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,190
Rym: Yeah, I'm looking at Rattleballs.

759
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:06,509
Rym: I think Rattleballs had a hand.

760
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,207
Guest: I'm not sure.

761
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,246
Rym: I'm not looking it up.

762
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:18,004
Rym: But when Finn saw the flash forward future of him on the train, his arm is just his fucking whip.

763
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,850
Guest: Wasn't his arm all decked out?

764
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:23,129
Rym: It was all decked out, but it's a decked out whip.

765
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:26,970
Rym: It's like a. it's like a weird arm with a hook.

766
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:32,904
Rym: And then on the end of the hook is a whip and then the other arm's got a semi-permanent looking gauntlet.

767
00:33:33,551 --> 00:33:33,927
Scott: Oh, yeah.

768
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,109
Rym: But oh, it's just a pillow.

769
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,782
Rym: So why don't you

770
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:57,349
Scott: make a list of like all the plot episodes of Adventure Time so you can like breeze, you know, not because you should only watch the plot episodes, but because if you've already watched the whole show but you need to refresh yourself because you only watched it once like me, you can refresh quickly and not have to rewatch, you know, the episodes that aren't.

771
00:33:58,322 --> 00:33:58,704
Rym: Well, is it?

772
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,540
Rym: is it plot episodes or gun episodes?

773
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:11,920
Scott: Any episode will count if it is an episode that affects either is, you know, a direct main plot episode like the two that started this season or the end of the season.

774
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:12,222
Scott: Right.

775
00:34:12,444 --> 00:34:14,520
Scott: Or one that has some sort of effect.

776
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:14,781
Scott: Right.

777
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:18,684
Scott: Because like the one where he gets the grass sword doesn't you know, it seems like a one off.

778
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:18,844
Scott: Right.

779
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:19,851
Scott: And that's the thing they do.

780
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:22,985
Scott: is even their one off episodic episodes don't?

781
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:25,353
Scott: it's like they have some sort of like.

782
00:34:25,454 --> 00:34:27,924
Scott: they leave a mark on the universe in some way.

783
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:28,425
Scott: Right.

784
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:34,039
Scott: By like creating a character or creating an item or changing a character or changing a place or a thing.

785
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:35,245
Scott: Right.

786
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:37,860
Scott: Or or the nature of a character's relationship.

787
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:44,045
Scott: And then they bring that back and it stays that way in all future episodes until it's changed again.

788
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:45,500
Guest: You mean the show has continuity?

789
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,062
Scott: Yeah.

790
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,632
Scott: All right.

791
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,853
Rym: Rattleballs just has a fucking hand, but it's not.

792
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:52,732
Scott: you know, there are a lot of things that have continuity.

793
00:34:53,097 --> 00:34:53,300
Scott: Right.

794
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:59,041
Scott: Like Marvel Comics or whatever, but they don't necessarily modify the continuity all the time.

795
00:34:59,544 --> 00:34:59,805
Scott: Right.

796
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:06,959
Rym: It's like almost every adventure type episode does something or at least it has an element that is probably intended to be used in the future if they want to.

797
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:07,582
Scott: Right.

798
00:35:08,385 --> 00:35:14,619
Scott: Whereas other things that have continuity will still have just episodic shit that doesn't affect the continuity in any way.

799
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:15,603
Scott: Right.

800
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:18,640
Scott: Like, OK, these are is a bunch of filler that doesn't affect anything.

801
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:19,167
Scott: Right.

802
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:20,079
Scott: Like one piece movies.

803
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:32,000
Rym: Well, I think the difference is Adventure Time does it much more subtly and aptly than ponies has lately and that ponies will zoom all the way in on the thing and be like, hey, guys, hey, guys, hey, guys, look at this.

804
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:33,169
Rym: Look right here.

805
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:34,419
Rym: This is the plot.

806
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:39,881
Rym: And Adventure Time is like just gets a cursed sword and then it becomes his arm at the end.

807
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:41,250
Scott: And then it's still.

808
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,780
Scott: it's actually still there the next episode.

809
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,305
Scott: Oh, my gosh.

810
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:44,660
Rym: But then some other things aren't still there.

811
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,604
Scott: What other show does that?

812
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:50,889
Rym: So in the preview for the next episode, he just has two human arms.

813
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:51,600
Rym: Just point that out.

814
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,326
Rym: I saw it.

815
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:53,660
Rym: I saw pictures from it.

816
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:57,178
Rym: I think it's just because that episode was directed and put together before.

817
00:35:58,141 --> 00:35:59,175
Guest: Is that the food chain episode?

818
00:35:59,297 --> 00:35:59,480
Guest: Yes.

819
00:35:59,700 --> 00:35:59,962
Guest: Oh, yeah.

820
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:00,525
Guest: That's probably why.

821
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:03,300
Rym: So are they going to do deal with that in some way?

822
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:04,050
Scott: Who knows?

823
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:04,499
Scott: I don't know.

824
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,323
Rym: I'm curious.

825
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:08,460
Scott: How about this Masaki Yuasa episode?

826
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,546
Scott: If you that's the episode.

827
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,380
Scott: I thought I didn't think that was the next one.

828
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,568
Scott: I thought that one still a ways out.

829
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:14,380
Rym: It's coming up soon anyway.

830
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:17,140
Rym: At any point, at any rate, he has two arms.

831
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,479
Scott: But that episode and the preview for it, you know, who's there?

832
00:36:21,261 --> 00:36:21,626
Rym: LSP?

833
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:22,578
Scott: Magic Man.

834
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,000
Rym: I like Magic Man a lot.

835
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:27,433
Scott: I don't like Magic Man.

836
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:27,879
Scott: He's a jerk.

837
00:36:32,301 --> 00:36:36,902
Rym: So do you think the show is going to keep getting more and more adult, like for real adult?

838
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:38,209
Rym: Like, is it going to be dealing with like?

839
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:42,420
Rym: really will it deal with more serious issues that it already has in the next season?

840
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:51,922
Guest: I think it might have to dip back into the subtlety after a while, because, you know, they they can push the boundaries being as popular as they are, a massively popular cartoon.

841
00:36:52,304 --> 00:37:01,919
Guest: But if they push it too far and stay too adult for too long, Cartoon Network is going to take issue because it's very, very important to them to keep that 8 to 12 little boy demographic watching the show.

842
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:08,098
Guest: And if they start, you know, losing interest because we're just dealing with grief and relationship issues and.

843
00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:13,601
Scott: Or maybe they'll get interest, you know, when I was eight to 12, I wouldn't want to watch this.

844
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:17,942
Rym: Yeah, but I think when I when I was eight to 12, I'd already seen Vampire Hunter D.

845
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:18,566
Scott: Right.

846
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:21,039
Guest: Not everybody had the same eight to 12 foot as you guys.

847
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:22,024
Rym: They should have.

848
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:24,640
Scott: They can get all the money from the smart kids, not the dumb kids.

849
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:26,940
Rym: It's like Donald Duck in Math Magic Land.

850
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:27,727
Guest: Right.

851
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:28,580
Guest: Money from the smart kids.

852
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,120
Rym: I think I think one easy thing they can do to move forward is resolve the fucking shit with Flame Princess and have Finn get over his grief.

853
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,760
Scott: Well, no, is they can start to combine different things.

854
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,121
Scott: Right.

855
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:42,340
Rym: So it's like you don't see me like Finn's arm and Finn's dead.

856
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:48,124
Scott: No, like, you know, there are parts of the plot that sort of go together like Finn's arm and Finn's dead.

857
00:37:48,487 --> 00:37:50,700
Scott: But there are other things that don't really go together.

858
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:54,680
Scott: Like, how about Flame Princess plus Lemon Hope?

859
00:37:55,222 --> 00:37:55,443
Scott: Right.

860
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:57,720
Scott: It's like those things don't even touch each other whatsoever.

861
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,502
Scott: What if they did?

862
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:03,100
Rym: That's the most is like goes with Lenny on a trip episode.

863
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:03,791
Scott: Exactly.

864
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:04,320
Scott: Right.

865
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,600
Rym: You've got to have 10 seasons before you start that shit.

866
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,102
Rym: Minimum.

867
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:10,220
Scott: I'm just saying there's a whole lot of territory of that nature.

868
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,360
Guest: They already know what's going to happen to Lemon Hope.

869
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,732
Rym: Yeah, we do.

870
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:14,300
Rym: Right.

871
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,540
Rym: We'll probably never see him again.

872
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:16,791
Scott: But there's a lot of time.

873
00:38:16,812 --> 00:38:17,279
Scott: There's no need.

874
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:18,760
Rym: Yeah, he's resolved.

875
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:21,119
Guest: He's just off hippying for the rest of his life.

876
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,224
Rym: Granted, the only real takeaway from Lemon Hope is, one, libertarianism is a failed philosophy.

877
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:28,440
Rym: Two, there's no such thing as fate and destiny.

878
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,760
Rym: Three, Peeves could have planned that better.

879
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:32,492
Guest: Oh, come on.

880
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:33,099
Guest: Come on.

881
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:34,379
Guest: You don't even know what happened.

882
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,920
Rym: Yeah, we have a good idea of what happened.

883
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,899
Guest: It looked like a war.

884
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,820
Rym: Actually, it reminded me a lot of the end of a book from a series.

885
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,800
Rym: I shouldn't say what it is because it might spoil things.

886
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:55,919
Rym: At the end of this book, it ends and you get an epilogue that takes place like 50,000 years later and it just kind of offhandedly reveals pretty much everything.

887
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,860
Guest: Man, that episode left me feeling drained.

888
00:38:59,362 --> 00:39:03,177
Rym: Yeah, that last scene, that was just so I loved it.

889
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,166
Rym: But geez, well, there was.

890
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:09,046
Rym: I mean, if you've seen Brazil, I have not that episode, that whole Lemon Hope.

891
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:15,440
Rym: that one Brazil's really good, but it's also really long and allegorical and at times boring.

892
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,958
Scott: I see where you go with this.

893
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:18,960
Scott: But Brazil is the Lemon Kingdom.

894
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,359
Rym: The Lemon Hope stuff was a straight up reference to Brazil.

895
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:27,497
Rym: OK, with the wings and all that stuff, with Lemon Hope, it's 100 percent.

896
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:30,200
Guest: I do want to see that movie.

897
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:33,080
Guest: You should watch that movie when I have several hours to put aside.

898
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,920
Rym: Just make sure you watch the correct version.

899
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,160
Rym: If you watch the wrong version, you'll know because it has a happy ending.

900
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:38,720
Guest: Oh, which version is on Netflix?

901
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:39,714
Rym: I don't know.

902
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:41,865
Rym: I really don't know.

903
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:43,900
Rym: Just if you see a happy ending, you fucked up.

904
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,866
Rym: That's all I can say.

905
00:39:45,732 --> 00:39:46,820
Rym: It does not end happily.

906
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:50,858
Guest: One important thing to note, the storyboard for the episode Lemon Hope.

907
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,720
Guest: at the very end, when they're showing the ruined city, they put a note there that said it was not bombed.

908
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,560
Guest: It's abandoned.

909
00:39:57,946 --> 00:40:00,300
Scott: Oh, well, I mean, you could tell that watching it, right?

910
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:08,600
Rym: But it's interesting that they made that that was intentional, that they wanted to make it clear that these people left, this kingdom failed.

911
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,679
Scott: Well, clearly, we're going to get an episode at some point.

912
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,363
Scott: Or move down.

913
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:12,900
Rym: Maybe they reintegrate with the candy people.

914
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,680
Scott: Where the Lemons leave the, you know, abandon the event, the Lemon Kingdom.

915
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,020
Rym: Well, I kind of like that more if they don't tell you how that resolved itself.

916
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:24,034
Guest: The Lemon stuff?

917
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:24,400
Rym: Yeah.

918
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:26,340
Guest: But that would mean we wouldn't see Lemon Grab again.

919
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:26,844
Guest: We have to.

920
00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:28,679
Rym: We could keep seeing Lemon Grab because...

921
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,459
Scott: What else is he going to do?

922
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,659
Rym: That could have resolved itself 500 years down the road.

923
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:35,000
Guest: He's going to come back and scream some more.

924
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,807
Guest: That's all I need.

925
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:37,139
Scott: Yeah, that's acceptable.

926
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:38,699
Rym: Is it now?

927
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:48,480
Rym: What we need is the episode where, like, LSP goes on an exchange program to cast a Lemon Grab to try and make diplomatic relations.

928
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,880
Scott: That's another kind of combo, right?

929
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,300
Scott: It's some Lemon Grab plus Marceline.

930
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:58,894
Rym: Well, they did have that episode where it was Lemon Grab, Tree Trunks, The Little Worm, Shelby, Ice King.

931
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,758
Scott: I loved that episode.

932
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,600
Scott: Sesame Street.

933
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,428
Rym: That episode was...

934
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:08,070
Guest: What does that noise mean?

935
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:10,490
Scott: Yeah, the episode where the armor is so...

936
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,549
Rym: That's season one, that armor.

937
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,349
Rym: Chews Goose's armor.

938
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:15,229
Guest: Oh, I only saw that one once, actually.

939
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,530
Scott: That's one of my favorite episodes.

940
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,419
Scott: It's so... Really?

941
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:18,224
Rym: Oh, yeah.

942
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,830
Rym: Scott just really likes Chews Goose.

943
00:41:20,913 --> 00:41:22,749
Rym: Like, really likes Chews Goose.

944
00:41:23,893 --> 00:41:37,310
Rym: Well... But I expected the show, because up until now, every time they've introduced some of these big plotty things, they ratchet down the tension within five or six episodes tops.

945
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:43,789
Rym: But since the Flame Princess incident, like, they've just left that hanging and they've referenced it.

946
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:48,309
Rym: And every time they've referenced it or gone back toward it, they've just ratcheted it up more.

947
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:53,290
Guest: Yeah, and the only way they resolved it this time was to give Finn even greater grief than losing his girlfriend.

948
00:41:53,711 --> 00:42:03,630
Scott: Yeah, it's like any episode you watch, even if it doesn't even mention it at all, it's like, they'll be like, for like a second, you know, Finn will be like, "Hmm," or something.

949
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:05,309
Scott: And you just can't not think about it.

950
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:10,267
Scott: It's like, you know, it's like if someone hadn't seen those earlier episodes, they wouldn't think that.

951
00:42:10,873 --> 00:42:12,909
Scott: But it's just like just seeing the characters there.

952
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:17,990
Scott: You think about all the things that they're carrying because you're carrying them because you saw that shit.

953
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:19,290
Rym: And they haven't unburdened us.

954
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,430
Scott: Even if they don't mention it or show it or anything.

955
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:23,550
Rym: Like Billy's bucket list, like that episode.

956
00:42:24,273 --> 00:42:30,490
Rym: I mean, one, they introduced what's-your-name, Billy's ex-girlfriend, Canyon, who's kind of awesome in a big way.

957
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:43,829
Rym: And just now we had, like he was talking to that Cloud girl and they keep introducing him to female characters in the same manner that they originally introduced him to Flame Princess, in the sense that it's just sort of this character that's there.

958
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,129
Scott: That's how Marceline showed up.

959
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,910
Rym: Yeah, but they're all just passing by.

960
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:50,930
Rym: And every time you see Finn just continuing to not deal with his issues.

961
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:56,150
Guest: Most of the characters Finn has met, encountered, or helped since the beginning has been female.

962
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:56,985
Rym: That is true.

963
00:42:57,831 --> 00:43:01,510
Guest: I don't know if the intention behind that has changed since the beginning and it's slowly evolving.

964
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,710
Guest: I think that is the case because it was just like rescue stuff in the beginning.

965
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:11,370
Rym: And they, well, they used to make a lot of jokes about how all the princesses really want to marry Finn.

966
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,410
Scott: Well, I even saw that in the tower.

967
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:17,950
Scott: It's like, yeah, all these princesses bought you all these gloves, fake arms, Finn.

968
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,509
Rym: So they reference that again, meaning maybe they're leading up to something again.

969
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:27,209
Scott: I think there was an episode on the list of upcoming episodes that it was something princess.

970
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,510
Rym: Sad face, food chain, princess day.

971
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:30,629
Scott: There you go.

972
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,390
Rym: That one's written.

973
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,690
Rym: Oh, that's, uh, so, uh, try to look at who did it.

974
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,570
Scott: Maybe we'll learn something about all these similar crowns.

975
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,149
Scott: All the princesses wear some shit.

976
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:42,710
Rym: Well, we learned about that with the Enchiridion stuff way back.

977
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:44,348
Rym: What else more are they going to do?

978
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:52,710
Rym: So I think the loudest I laughed in all of Adventure Time was when LSP's Crystal just bounced off the Enchiridion and wasn't involved.

979
00:43:54,052 --> 00:43:56,029
Rym: I laughed out loud so hard.

980
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,549
Rym: Like, I think back to that moment as being something that I really enjoy.

981
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,889
Guest: One of the moments that squicked me out the most from the show was when they were pulling it out of her head.

982
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:08,614
Scott: Right.

983
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:10,089
Scott: But it's like, you know, we know.

984
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,850
Rym: Well, no, it's quick.

985
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,890
Rym: Me out is anytime True Trunks is talking.

986
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:13,232
Rym: Right.

987
00:44:13,293 --> 00:44:16,969
Scott: We know that much about the Enchiridion, but it's like, where did the Enchiridion come from?

988
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:17,819
Scott: Who created it?

989
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,589
Scott: Why did Billy have it?

990
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:19,369
Scott: Who wrote that shit, right?

991
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,109
Scott: It's like, we know this post-apocalyptic stuff we know at least enough about.

992
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,131
Scott: Right.

993
00:44:25,152 --> 00:44:30,550
Scott: Like, how other than radiation did you get from the post-apocalypse to the magical world?

994
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:32,870
Scott: You know, where did these specific magic things come from?

995
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:33,828
Scott: Like, where did the Lich come from?

996
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:44,550
Rym: Well, the Lich was, I mean, either that bomb blowing up in that place released something that was always there or that bomb itself was special in some way.

997
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:45,870
Scott: Yeah, it's stuff like that, right?

998
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,349
Guest: That bomb seemed to be the thing that released not only destruction, but also magic into the world.

999
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:50,892
Rym: Yep.

1000
00:44:50,973 --> 00:44:52,410
Rym: But with magic comes the Lich.

1001
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:53,230
Scott: Yes.

1002
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:53,681
Scott: Sure.

1003
00:44:54,351 --> 00:44:57,690
Guest: Because a world where the Lich never existed is one where the bomb never went off.

1004
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,090
Scott: But what about the rest of the universe?

1005
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,969
Scott: Like, the shit on Mars and whatnot and other dimensions and...

1006
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,180
Rym: That's something they have not addressed very well.

1007
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:14,250
Rym: is the rest of the cosmos, because that was much more sinister and mysterious all the way up through when the Prismo stuff happened, and now it's getting increasingly humorous.

1008
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,550
Scott: They've run out of room on ooze that are reaching into space more frequently.

1009
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:26,810
Rym: Like, the space stuff is being more and more prominent, which is interesting, but at the same time, it removes the sort of ominousness of the fact that there is an outside world.

1010
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:33,635
Rym: Like, the fact that everything that we'd seen up to this point could have been undone by Prismo in one wish is not as ominous.

1011
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:37,990
Rym: now that there's basically Green Lantern space stuff happening and space is dead.

1012
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:38,932
Rym: Space is dead.

1013
00:45:38,992 --> 00:45:40,076
Rym: Finn's dead in space.

1014
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:43,349
Rym: The space Hitler is out doing his thing and, like, wherever he is...

1015
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:44,710
Scott: You gotta assume he's space Hitler.

1016
00:45:45,316 --> 00:45:46,470
Rym: I am 100% sure he's space Hitler.

1017
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:49,210
Scott: But think about all those other space Hitlers that were also released.

1018
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,350
Rym: No, those are space Goibels.

1019
00:45:51,134 --> 00:45:51,324
Rym: Okay.

1020
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,374
Rym: They're not Hitler.

1021
00:45:52,394 --> 00:45:54,890
Rym: They're not... He's the leader of the space Hitlers already.

1022
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,010
Rym: He became their leader in, what, eight seconds?

1023
00:45:57,917 --> 00:45:58,107
Scott: Maybe.

1024
00:45:59,315 --> 00:45:59,769
Guest: Maybe less.

1025
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,535
Rym: I wonder if he was always their leader.

1026
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:06,250
Rym: I wonder if everyone on that place was arrested with him.

1027
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:10,310
Guest: They're not going to revisit that again for a while.

1028
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,350
Guest: They're going to treat it the same way they did with the Lich Stuff.

1029
00:46:12,912 --> 00:46:14,198
Rym: Which I think is fine.

1030
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,790
Rym: I'm more interested in resolving Finn's emotional baggage.

1031
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:31,310
Guest: Yeah, I believe they're going to work on, you know, I would put "resolve" in quotes because that's a lot of shit to get over, but they're going to work on building us back up to some fun episodes, not just, like, one interspersed with all these depressing ones like we've been getting.

1032
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:31,791
Rym: Yep.

1033
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:40,146
Rym: Well, James 2 was the most back to old Adventure Time we've seen, I think, because it had all those scenes where Finn and Jake are just like, "Yeah, we're going to sit this one

1034
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:40,350
Rym: out.".

1035
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:40,848
Rym: That was funny.

1036
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,890
Rym: Yeah, and they're just in the background the whole time giggling and not getting involved.

1037
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,950
Guest: And they got PB to chill for a little bit, too.

1038
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:53,130
Rym: That's my favorite scene when they're all up there laughing and you see the Banana Guard and the James both trying to work it out, can't quite get there.

1039
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,023
Guest: Yeah, PB's sitting out there being like, "Yeah, I made those idiots.

1040
00:46:57,928 --> 00:46:58,289
Guest: God damn

1041
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:58,370
Guest: it.".

1042
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:04,504
Scott: Those are definitely some of my favorite episodes, the ones where it's just Adventure Time, like the one where she's like, "Finn goes in the dungeon,

1043
00:47:04,545 --> 00:47:04,686
Scott: woooo!".

1044
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:06,649
Scott: That's the whole episode, right?

1045
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:11,148
Scott: Or even the one where the armor is, "It's about questing, adventuring, and...".

1046
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:17,929
Rym: Most of those episodes from season four-ish onward have had moments of issues.

1047
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:22,069
Scott: Or even like Infinity Train.

1048
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:29,430
Rym: But it's interesting because the more I watch the show, the more I want to see those issues and see that stuff be addressed.

1049
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:33,090
Rym: Yet, as you kind of pointed out, that's the opposite of what young kids want to see.

1050
00:47:33,652 --> 00:47:33,959
Scott: Maybe.

1051
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:34,409
Scott: Who knows?

1052
00:47:35,131 --> 00:47:37,890
Guest: Maybe they're trying to Harry Potter it and have it actually grow with its audience.

1053
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:43,189
Guest: But there will be a time when most of that audience will just stop watching Cartoon Network because they suck.

1054
00:47:43,951 --> 00:47:46,209
Rym: I think most of the people who watch Adventure Time pirate it.

1055
00:47:48,111 --> 00:47:54,870
Rym: I mean, every Tuesday when I go to watch the episode, I'll just note that the Pirate Bay has a lot of people seeing Adventure Time.

1056
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:57,430
Scott: There is sort of a thing happening.

1057
00:47:57,751 --> 00:47:59,370
Scott: My coworker, he has a baby.

1058
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,250
Scott: The baby's maybe not even one or whatever.

1059
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:05,390
Scott: But he watches Adventure Time with the baby.

1060
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,389
Scott: And he says the closing song puts the baby to sleep.

1061
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:08,408
Scott: The one with the bees.

1062
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,468
Scott: Yeah, exactly.

1063
00:48:11,451 --> 00:48:21,070
Scott: So it's like, you're gonna see people with babies who want adults, 20, 30 year olds who make babies watch Adventure Time with their kids.

1064
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:21,530
Rym: Yeah.

1065
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,630
Rym: But they can, you know what?

1066
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,168
Rym: They can do a thing like newspaper comics too.

1067
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,170
Scott: More so than the other shows.

1068
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,950
Scott: I mean, it's like other shows appeal to adults as well.

1069
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:30,790
Scott: Powerpuff Girls, Ponies, whatever.

1070
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:38,750
Scott: But I think Adventure Time more so is one that people will actually watch together and spread to younger folk, right?

1071
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:43,270
Scott: And especially with having it available on many, many formats.

1072
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:49,670
Scott: It's like if you have my parents' cable, you can just watch every episode on demand up to like the newest one.

1073
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,470
Guest: Yeah, Adventure Time is going for staying power.

1074
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,850
Guest: I mean, they pretty much already have that.

1075
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,550
Scott: So people can definitely start at the beginning with ease, even if they're not pirates.

1076
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:57,509
Rym: Well, that's what I was getting at.

1077
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:04,070
Rym: The beauty of Adventure Time is that because it had, I mean, the show really, really evolved season to season.

1078
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:07,930
Rym: Like season one is vastly different from seasons three and four.

1079
00:49:08,251 --> 00:49:10,650
Scott: So is any long running show, Simpsons, Flintstones?

1080
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,410
Guest: No, this is a really stark difference.

1081
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,178
Rym: And Sailor Moon episode 199, not that different.

1082
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:17,489
Guest: Not the best example though.

1083
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,350
Rym: Yeah, but I'm talking about long running American shows.

1084
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,450
Rym: Okay, so long running American shows.

1085
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,869
Rym: Like Ponies, pretty much the same so far.

1086
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,590
Guest: Powerpuff Girls still, status quo is God.

1087
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:29,109
Rym: Yep.

1088
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,150
Rym: Nothing ever affects the Powerpuff Girls universe.

1089
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:33,830
Scott: I didn't even know that show was still going.

1090
00:49:34,332 --> 00:49:35,110
Guest: It's been remade.

1091
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:36,150
Scott: Oh, okay.

1092
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,670
Rym: But because the archives exist is the kind of show that like we'll watch.

1093
00:49:43,071 --> 00:49:48,458
Rym: And then if we add babies, we could start again from season one and we know where it's going.

1094
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:50,550
Rym: so we can just kind of watch it as the kid grows up.

1095
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,370
Scott: I don't know, Judith, do you actually watch it on real TV?

1096
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:54,109
Scott: No, I don't have real TV.

1097
00:49:54,870 --> 00:50:00,390
Scott: Okay, but I heard from someone who had real TV that what happens is the episodes are only like half an episode slot, right?

1098
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:05,490
Scott: That what they'll do is when you go to watch the new Adventure Time, if it's not a two-parter, right?

1099
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,559
Scott: In the first half of the 30-minute slot, they'll show the old episode.

1100
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,590
Scott: that's relevant to the new episode, right?

1101
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,729
Scott: So that you know what the hell's going on.

1102
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:13,330
Guest: Typically, yeah.

1103
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,590
Guest: Anytime I've caught it on cable, that's what they've been doing.

1104
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:16,483
Scott: Right, so it's like...

1105
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:17,629
Rym: Ponies does the same thing.

1106
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:24,870
Scott: Right, so if you're starting out and that's part of what... It's weird how they cram so much into these short episodes.

1107
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:29,450
Rym: Yeah, more happens in these short Adventure Time episodes than in like an hour of a lot of shows I like.

1108
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:36,090
Scott: It's like they really use like... There'll be scenes or shots that are like less than a second that say like 10 million things, right?

1109
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,610
Scott: That no other show can pull that off really, right now at least.

1110
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:46,090
Scott: But you know, that first slot, they'll be like, "Oh, okay, so this episode's gonna be about Flame Princess again.

1111
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,108
Scott: We're gonna show the last appearance of Flame Princess in the first

1112
00:50:49,148 --> 00:50:49,390
Scott: slot.".

1113
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:54,030
Guest: Some people analyze which episodes are paired with the new ones to foreshadow things.

1114
00:50:55,212 --> 00:51:00,970
Guest: When Betty premiered, it was paired with I Remember You, which is a pretty obvious connection, but they were laying it on thick.

1115
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,986
Scott: But it's like they couldn't do that if the episode was full 20, 30 minutes long.

1116
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:09,588
Scott: You wouldn't have, you know, there wouldn't be a time slot for it unless they made it an hour long thing, you know.

1117
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:20,510
Rym: Of course, at the same time, technology, if this was just internet distribution, you could just have every episode has the paired episodes that are relevant to this episode.

1118
00:51:22,275 --> 00:51:22,890
Rym: Just kind of there.

1119
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:23,989
Rym: Watch it if you want to or not.

1120
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:32,390
Scott: Make a website that is every Adventure Time episode, not necessarily in order, right, but with arrows pointing to the ones that, you know, come off of it, right?

1121
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:33,369
Rym: Just make a web.

1122
00:51:34,131 --> 00:51:36,810
Scott: And then, you know, a website where you can, like, search the episode.

1123
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,110
Scott: So it could be like, "Show me every episode with Chews Goose.

1124
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,530
Scott: Show me every episode with Lumpy Space Princess.

1125
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:43,966
Scott: Show me every episode with Hot Dog

1126
00:51:43,986 --> 00:51:44,369
Scott: Princess.".

1127
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,290
Guest: I think there's only like three episodes with Chews Goose.

1128
00:51:46,912 --> 00:51:47,950
Rym: Yeah, he's not that common.

1129
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,530
Scott: He's in at least five or six episodes.

1130
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,950
Rym: It's probably a pain in the ass to write.

1131
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,849
Rym: It's probably why Zecora doesn't say that much either.

1132
00:51:56,594 --> 00:51:57,529
Scott: He's in the video games.

1133
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:03,649
Rym: I like in the comic, Flame Princess tricks the fake Chews Goose by getting him to say the word purple and then he just spazzes out.

1134
00:52:05,937 --> 00:52:06,589
Guest: I remember that.

1135
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,030
Rym: Of course, the comic continuity.

1136
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,089
Rym: Flame Princess and Finn are just dating and everything's cool.

1137
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,050
Scott: So does the comic even count?

1138
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,490
Guest: There's several different comics.

1139
00:52:13,771 --> 00:52:14,289
Guest: None of them count.

1140
00:52:15,151 --> 00:52:18,149
Rym: Yeah, the comics are all very different in timbre and tone, too.

1141
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,470
Scott: Well, it depends on who's the writer.

1142
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:25,190
Scott: They haven't had like just one set of people writing the whole thing from start to finish, right?

1143
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,490
Rym: Well, Adventure Time is not that way either.

1144
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,050
Rym: There is a wide cast of people who write in storyboard.

1145
00:52:30,774 --> 00:52:31,630
Scott: That is sort of interesting.

1146
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:34,770
Scott: One thing that really interests me is you look at the list of Adventure Time episodes.

1147
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,210
Rym: I mean, look, Episode 79, Hot to the Touch.

1148
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,009
Rym: Cole Sanchez, Rebecca Sugar.

1149
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,588
Rym: The next episode, Five Short Gravels.

1150
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,610
Rym: Tim Herpich, Skylar Page, and Cole Sanchez.

1151
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,450
Scott: Right, but those episodes have nothing to do with each other.

1152
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:49,590
Scott: Look at the first two episodes of this season, which are pretty much tied together as one episode.

1153
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:51,230
Scott: Different writers.

1154
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:55,330
Scott: These people must have some kind of communication going on.

1155
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:56,910
Guest: They all work in the same studio.

1156
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,548
Scott: They're all on the same page all the time.

1157
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,370
Rym: You know there's a continuity Bible.

1158
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:04,908
Scott: Right, but like other people who can't seem to pull it off when they have different writers like that.

1159
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:08,090
Guest: And they all have a discussion before they finalize the storyboard.

1160
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,009
Guest: Like everybody meets and discusses the script.

1161
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:15,370
Scott: How come other shows don't have all their writers so tight with each other like that?

1162
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:15,989
Guest: Because they suck more.

1163
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:17,388
Scott: I guess that's true.

1164
00:53:17,872 --> 00:53:22,049
Rym: I might come out of the fact that how Adventure Time started and came to be.

1165
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:30,050
Rym: A group of friends who trusted each other bring other professional people who they trust in and they give each other a lot of leeway.

1166
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,050
Rym: Which you don't see with other things.

1167
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,595
Rym: It's like South Park.

1168
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:37,510
Rym: has that going to a degree that they only bring people in who they trust.

1169
00:53:38,212 --> 00:53:38,890
Rym: A hundred percent.

1170
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,409
Scott: The South Park didn't bring people in?

1171
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,769
Rym: Well they brought people in until they had enough people.

1172
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:45,389
Rym: But there's nobody on their crew.

1173
00:53:45,773 --> 00:53:47,510
Scott: Most of their people are animators.

1174
00:53:48,131 --> 00:53:50,830
Rym: Yeah but I'm saying the people in their crew are people they trust a hundred percent.

1175
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,990
Rym: Like this guy's gonna get the comment right.

1176
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:57,845
Scott: People who work 24 hours a day for six weeks a year and then the rest of the year take off.

1177
00:53:58,131 --> 00:54:01,109
Rym: I kind of really want that production schedule in my life.

1178
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:06,810
Scott: Just we'll make GeekNights for like six months out of the year and the other six months do nothing.

1179
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:07,430
Rym: Like Penny Arcade.

1180
00:54:08,934 --> 00:54:14,067
Rym: The four paxes should be on four weekends in a row and then they don't do anything the rest of the year.

1181
00:54:16,361 --> 00:54:16,590
Scott: Sure.

1182
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:24,490
Scott: Microhoolik just goes and draws all the comics for the whole year and I'm in a month and the rest of the year doesn't do anything.

1183
00:54:28,336 --> 00:54:29,289
Rym: But Adventure Time?

1184
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:37,128
Rym: I think it still is my consistently most favorite cartoon that I'm watching or have watched in recent memory.

1185
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:39,624
Scott: I don't know if it's my favorite.

1186
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:40,989
Rym: I really like ponies.

1187
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:44,370
Scott: But because it's so long and it just doesn't stop, right?

1188
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,575
Scott: It's like all other.

1189
00:54:45,836 --> 00:54:49,430
Scott: regardless of how much I like Adventure Time relative to say something like Kill la Kill.

1190
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,949
Scott: It's like, well, Kill la Kill's over.

1191
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:51,326
Scott: Yeah.

1192
00:54:51,611 --> 00:54:53,690
Scott: So even if I like that more, it's gone.

1193
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:56,930
Scott: And, you know, Adventure Time, at least for now, looks like it ain't going anywhere.

1194
00:54:57,551 --> 00:55:09,469
Scott: So it just by the fact that it'll just always be there, regardless of how much you like it, it will have a stronger emotional bond to you simply because time makes the heart grow fonder, I guess.

1195
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:11,109
Guest: Sometimes.

1196
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:14,370
Guest: Adventure Time is my American cartoon favorite hands down.

1197
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:15,388
Guest: It beats out ponies like.

1198
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:15,949
Scott: Wow.

1199
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:16,890
Scott: Yeah, definitely.

1200
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,510
Scott: He's beaten ponies now.

1201
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,650
Rym: There was a time where, for me, ponies would have beaten Adventure Time.

1202
00:55:21,872 --> 00:55:23,030
Rym: But that time is long gone.

1203
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,089
Scott: In the middle of season one.

1204
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:27,650
Rym: Yeah, maybe through season two of ponies.

1205
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,629
Scott: Not really, no.

1206
00:55:29,011 --> 00:55:30,050
Rym: Yeah, season two of ponies.

1207
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,410
Rym: Because what was contemporary Adventure Time at that point that you were watching?

1208
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,469
Scott: I didn't watch any Adventure Time.

1209
00:55:36,671 --> 00:55:39,765
Rym: But also the time between seasons is pretty short.

1210
00:55:39,785 --> 00:55:40,830
Rym: with Adventure Time, I've noticed.

1211
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:45,070
Rym: Compared to, say, Archer, which just stops for a long time before it starts up again.

1212
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:47,489
Scott: Also, the Adventure Time season has so many episodes.

1213
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,730
Guest: Season five, I think it played for like a year or a year and a half.

1214
00:55:52,271 --> 00:55:53,930
Scott: How do they even count when the season?

1215
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,570
Scott: Aren't they supposed to start and stop seasons at the same time as every other show starts?

1216
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:01,290
Guest: Season five was a little weird because it was split into season 5.1 and 5.2.

1217
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,430
Guest: And it's twice the length of any other season.

1218
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,570
Scott: The first 5.1, 5 and 5.26.

1219
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:07,049
Scott: Who knows?

1220
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:08,990
Rym: They have stupid reasons for this stuff.

1221
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:14,270
Rym: I was reading a long article about how Hasbro does its seasons and when they do a half season or a whole season of ponies.

1222
00:56:14,713 --> 00:56:16,450
Rym: And it depends on these marketing metrics.

1223
00:56:16,811 --> 00:56:18,130
Rym: It's all this complicated crap.

1224
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:26,270
Scott: I've been noticing the live action shows that I don't watch, but my co-workers are talking about how what they'll do is like, okay, this is the last season of Mad Men.

1225
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:33,390
Scott: Instead of just making it the last season, they'll just take it and cut it in half to make two seasons to make the show last another year or whatever, right?

1226
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:39,229
Scott: Even though they won't make any more episodes, they'll just take that last season and cut it in half just to drag the show a little bit more.

1227
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:39,942
Scott: It's like, why?

1228
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,969
Scott: Does it really, you know, just to keep it in people's mindshare for another 12 months or whatever.

1229
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:47,710
Scott: I don't know what these people are thinking.

1230
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:51,410
Rym: So let's try to predict what's going to happen in the rest of the season.

1231
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,230
Scott: Right, because our obvious prediction of arms getting off, well, it happened, right?

1232
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:56,570
Rym: So where is this going?

1233
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:57,870
Rym: Judith, where's adventure time going?

1234
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,430
Guest: Pin's gotta find a replacement.

1235
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:00,686
Scott: Well, okay.

1236
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,370
Rym: Arm or girlfriend?

1237
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:04,190
Guest: I don't know about girlfriend.

1238
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:07,689
Guest: Flame Princess has got to be addressed again for sure.

1239
00:57:08,611 --> 00:57:09,590
Guest: I don't know where that's going.

1240
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:19,570
Guest: At first I thought that her kingdom was going to fall apart because her policy for just honesty seemed so naive and doomed that I thought that the kingdom was going to have like an internal war or something.

1241
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,590
Guest: But that doesn't, well, that didn't work.

1242
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,589
Rym: I think it helps that all the subjects of the flame kingdom are actually really derpy.

1243
00:57:26,451 --> 00:57:27,890
Rym: They're not the brightest.

1244
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,090
Scott: Not even Flame King.

1245
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,189
Scott: Flame King's derpy too.

1246
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:32,570
Rym: Flame King is really bad at conspiracies.

1247
00:57:32,872 --> 00:57:35,126
Scott: Even his Boba Fett guy is dumb as shit.

1248
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,489
Rym: That guy was totally a Boba Fett though.

1249
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:39,230
Scott: I don't remember his name.

1250
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,650
Scott: Every time he was on screen, I'm like, that's the Flame King's Boba Fett.

1251
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,550
Guest: It's really hard to predict adventure time though.

1252
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,290
Guest: I typically don't try to unless I find something extremely obvious.

1253
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:56,230
Rym: Like I can predict the really broad strokes, but that's as far as I've gotten.

1254
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:59,549
Rym: All my specifics have pretty much been wrong unilaterally.

1255
00:58:00,036 --> 00:58:00,463
Scott: Mm hmm.

1256
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:11,250
Scott: Well, the one, the only thing that like is, is strong in my memory of like a loose end is the episode where Marceline and the doll or whatever, and the witch took the shit away.

1257
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:11,620
Scott: Right.

1258
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:13,690
Scott: It's like that witch is coming back hardcore.

1259
00:58:14,181 --> 00:58:14,330
Guest: Yeah.

1260
00:58:15,015 --> 00:58:16,030
Guest: She said she was coming back.

1261
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:16,590
Scott: That's right.

1262
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,650
Scott: That's, that's, that's the thing that's been looming.

1263
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:27,810
Rym: And in the Betty episode, sort of like intentionally forgotten and un, in the Betty episode, we saw specifically why objects like that are so powerful.

1264
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:29,690
Rym: Think about what that means.

1265
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:38,829
Rym: This is an object that has power over either Princess Bubblegum or her legacy for as long as that shirt has been existing and treasured.

1266
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,570
Rym: Mm hmm.

1267
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:49,530
Rym: Which means theoretically the Sky Witch could mess with the origin of the Candy Kingdom in the same way that Ice King messed with his own backstory.

1268
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:57,530
Guest: Except she doesn't because the Candy Kingdom continues to grow and expand until it's eventually abandoned within the span of a thousand years from the point that we're watching.

1269
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:01,130
Rym: Well, abandoned, moved, was it just the Lemon Kingdom?

1270
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:03,790
Scott: Maybe there were just some people who really liked fucking candy.

1271
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:04,850
Guest: That wasn't the Lemon Kingdom.

1272
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:05,810
Guest: That was the Candy Kingdom.

1273
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,650
Guest: You could see the castle in the middle.

1274
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:09,370
Rym: Oh yeah, you're right.

1275
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:09,830
Rym: You're right.

1276
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,109
Scott: Maybe if you just really liked candy and ate it.

1277
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:12,787
Rym: You know what?

1278
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:17,810
Rym: Maybe that's just that deer came back and kidnapped everyone again.

1279
00:59:18,312 --> 00:59:18,466
Scott: Yes.

1280
00:59:18,811 --> 00:59:21,630
Scott: That's the kind of, that's the kind of thing that deer was basically just this joke.

1281
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,281
Scott: That would be the lamest thing.

1282
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:24,490
Guest: that that deer died, by the way.

1283
00:59:25,052 --> 00:59:25,448
Scott: Oh, did it?

1284
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:25,730
Guest: Yeah.

1285
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,410
Guest: Magic Man turned him into a telescope.

1286
00:59:28,194 --> 00:59:28,850
Rym: He's not dead then.

1287
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,690
Rym: He's just a telescope.

1288
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:30,127
Rym: He's dead.

1289
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:30,930
Guest: Confirmed.

1290
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:31,929
Guest: Word of God.

1291
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:36,190
Rym: I do not believe in word of God when it comes to analyzing shows.

1292
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:38,330
Scott: What is this word of God?

1293
00:59:38,552 --> 00:59:38,890
Guest: I don't know.

1294
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,210
Guest: Somebody asked if that was the same deer who got turned into a telescope and is it now dead?

1295
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,910
Guest: I think they asked at one of the panels at a convention.

1296
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,350
Rym: Yeah, yeah.

1297
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,510
Scott: I was talking about the deer in the tower episode that we just saw.

1298
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:49,208
Guest: Oh, that deer?

1299
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,310
Guest: Maybe that was his father.

1300
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:53,410
Scott: Maybe that's why he's alone.

1301
00:59:55,771 --> 00:59:57,230
Rym: But that deer is just a telescope.

1302
00:59:57,514 --> 00:59:58,610
Rym: So it's dead temporarily.

1303
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:59,889
Rym: We could turn it back into a deer.

1304
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,288
Guest: Nobody's ever going to find that deer again.

1305
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,030
Guest: Magic Man isn't anyway.

1306
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:05,247
Rym: Magic Man.

1307
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,790
Scott: Who's the, who's the, the other thing is who's the shitty magician guy?

1308
01:00:10,495 --> 01:00:10,890
Scott: The shitty wizard.

1309
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,070
Rym: What, Avrica Daniel?

1310
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:12,583
Rym: Yeah.

1311
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,166
Scott: There's something up with him too.

1312
01:00:14,673 --> 01:00:15,730
Rym: He kind of got resolved.

1313
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,210
Guest: Kind of, but he's just like Ice King's bestie for a while and then he ditched.

1314
01:00:19,691 --> 01:00:20,250
Rym: That's about it.

1315
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:20,621
Rym: Yup.

1316
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:22,470
Scott: There's something.

1317
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:25,130
Scott: The fact that they even brought him back at all, right?

1318
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,330
Scott: Beyond his one episode.

1319
01:00:26,531 --> 01:00:36,790
Rym: I got to say, since they've kind of just spilled Ice King's entire load, it's really hard to watch any scene with Ice King without just being really depressed about Alzheimer's.

1320
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,498
Scott: I'm kind of, I'm kind of glad that there's.

1321
01:00:38,558 --> 01:00:42,150
Scott: no, we haven't even seen Ice King since then because I don't like Ice King.

1322
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:42,830
Scott: I never liked Ice King.

1323
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:46,370
Rym: Well, Finn just fucked up his house apparently in the episode we just watched.

1324
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,630
Scott: That's happened like 10 million times.

1325
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:48,029
Rym: I know.

1326
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,290
Scott: He just makes a new one with his ice powers.

1327
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:56,490
Guest: One thing I can predict is Betty's presence in Ooo means that the Ice King will eventually become cured and returned to being Simon.

1328
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:57,687
Guest: Otherwise they wouldn't have kept her there.

1329
01:00:58,711 --> 01:01:01,429
Rym: Or, well, they could do something really tragic with that.

1330
01:01:02,516 --> 01:01:02,667
Guest: What?

1331
01:01:03,733 --> 01:01:04,448
Scott: What would that be?

1332
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:11,550
Rym: Maybe she finds a way to give him succor and peace and there is no cure.

1333
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:12,749
Rym: And maybe that's the moral.

1334
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:15,410
Guest: Maybe that would be super dark.

1335
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:16,286
Rym: Yeah, that would be.

1336
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:28,050
Rym: But it's weird because as an adult who likes media and has seen a lot of movies, I'm almost as I get older, I'm drawn more and more towards shocking, dark, severe endings to things.

1337
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:31,590
Rym: But at the same time, I'm almost pleasantly surprised when that doesn't happen.

1338
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,470
Guest: That would be killing a major character.

1339
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:34,728
Guest: I don't know if they could get away with that.

1340
01:01:36,372 --> 01:01:40,510
Rym: But at the same time, they can't use him for his original purpose anymore.

1341
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:42,490
Guest: Being creepy and sad.

1342
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:49,590
Rym: Creep, but creepy, sad and hilariously stealing princesses is now just creepy and sad when it happens.

1343
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:52,810
Guest: That's probably why they're giving him some time, because they can't do anything.

1344
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:55,190
Rym: Yeah, but how do they bring him back without it being depressing?

1345
01:01:55,610 --> 01:02:01,828
Rym: Any time he steals a princess now, it's, oh, Ice King with Alzheimer's stole a princess because he's fucked up.

1346
01:02:02,392 --> 01:02:03,010
Rym: How tragic.

1347
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:03,949
Guest: Bet he's still out there.

1348
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,010
Guest: Maybe maybe she'll come back if she's watching over him.

1349
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,749
Guest: Maybe she'll stop him from doing that shit.

1350
01:02:08,371 --> 01:02:14,387
Scott: Maybe they can somehow get him to where, you know, like you basically they can have their cake and eat it, too.

1351
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,910
Scott: Like, oh, he knows he's Simon, but he's still a kooky ice king.

1352
01:02:18,538 --> 01:02:18,728
Scott: Right.

1353
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:21,890
Scott: Like he gets his memory back and he's somewhere in the middle.

1354
01:02:22,116 --> 01:02:22,370
Scott: Right.

1355
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:26,230
Scott: But he's still kooky and he's still, you know, likes ninjas.

1356
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:28,769
Rym: But then he takes the mad scientist role away from peeps.

1357
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:31,030
Guest: He's not a mad scientist.

1358
01:02:31,391 --> 01:02:32,990
Rym: That's what he would become if he had some memories.

1359
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,069
Guest: And he believes in all the kind of stuff that she doesn't.

1360
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,790
Guest: So he would be on the opposite end of the spectrum.

1361
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:37,670
Rym: She believes in magic.

1362
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,109
Rym: She's just pissed off that it works.

1363
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:43,470
Guest: She thinks magic is science or she denies that magic is anything but science.

1364
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:45,190
Rym: Yeah, which she's probably right about.

1365
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:46,949
Rym: But at the same time, her science isn't quite there yet.

1366
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:51,190
Rym: I love how dismissive Jake is of her time travel.

1367
01:02:53,031 --> 01:02:54,048
Guest: He was just like the viewer.

1368
01:02:56,761 --> 01:02:56,989
Rym: All right.

1369
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,310
Rym: Of course, granted, that episode, you know, we're talking about dark.

1370
01:02:59,552 --> 01:03:01,209
Rym: That episode was fucked up.

1371
01:03:01,394 --> 01:03:01,624
Guest: Oh, yeah.

1372
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,929
Rym: LSP murdered that dude.

1373
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,450
Guest: Yeah, well, he he got sent to another dimension.

1374
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:08,450
Guest: He might as well be dead.

1375
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:08,724
Rym: Yeah.

1376
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:15,469
Rym: But when they first present that, oh, the time travel have that outside cool thing where you see that alternate world.

1377
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,377
Rym: Then that episode is just.

1378
01:03:17,578 --> 01:03:21,590
Rym: she killed him by cutting him in half and then sent the rest of the body to join the dead half.

1379
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:26,110
Guest: Yeah, that episode premiered just around the end of season five.

1380
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:30,170
Guest: And we thought it was going to be like a little breath of fresh air between all the tragic stuff.

1381
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:30,805
Guest: It wasn't.

1382
01:03:31,075 --> 01:03:31,250
Guest: Yeah.

1383
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:33,530
Rym: But look at the last major LSP episode we had.

1384
01:03:33,814 --> 01:03:34,450
Rym: It was similarly.

1385
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,341
Scott: I mean, the end, the more she's trying to get in the wedding and she's hiding in the woods.

1386
01:03:37,751 --> 01:03:39,649
Rym: Yeah, it was just, wow, she's fucked up.

1387
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:43,230
Rym: And then the episode before that was her and the pizza guy.

1388
01:03:43,391 --> 01:03:46,990
Rym: And the moral was Finn and Jake being like, oh, it's just LSP is emotional bullshit.

1389
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,370
Scott: That's something they could resolve if they wanted to.

1390
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,250
Scott: They could resolve bread.

1391
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:51,729
Scott: They could be like, here's bread.

1392
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:53,150
Guest: Oh, who cares about bread?

1393
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:53,708
Scott: I care about bread.

1394
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:54,546
Rym: You want to end it?

1395
01:03:54,811 --> 01:03:55,723
Scott: He's probably so lumpy.

1396
01:03:57,011 --> 01:04:03,010
Guest: Yeah, that that episode with LSP and Johnny, the guy who she not killed, that was actually storyboarded by Penn Ward himself.

1397
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:04,190
Rym: Yeah.

1398
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,088
Scott: Twisted fucker.

1399
01:04:05,331 --> 01:04:06,349
Scott: Doesn't he do the LSP voice?

1400
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,069
Scott: Yes, he does.

1401
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:07,368
Scott: Yeah.

1402
01:04:07,751 --> 01:04:10,110
Guest: So that one ended with Princess Bubblegum drinking.

1403
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:11,566
Rym: Yeah, it did.

1404
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:17,350
Rym: Princess Bubblegum also is increasingly not a happy person.

1405
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,089
Guest: Yeah, she's going to crack one day.

1406
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,909
Rym: Yeah, because she's been a lot happier in older seasons.

1407
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:26,710
Rym: She still had issues, still working on stuff, but she was a lot more good natured and easygoing.

1408
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:30,110
Rym: And now she seems to pretty much always be harried or angry.

1409
01:04:30,411 --> 01:04:34,449
Guest: They're evolving her character into something much more, I would say darker, but really much more neutral.

1410
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:38,669
Guest: Just a character who believes the ends justify the means.

1411
01:04:39,712 --> 01:04:41,422
Rym: And of course, at the same time, the show has done nothing.

1412
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:42,790
Rym: but tell me that she is right.

1413
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:43,724
Guest: I know.

1414
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:51,390
Guest: I know they make us question her morally because she does things that make us very uncomfortable as people, but it doesn't prove her wrong ever.

1415
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:51,990
Rym: Yeah.

1416
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,350
Rym: Well, I mean, let's go all the way back.

1417
01:04:53,450 --> 01:05:04,269
Rym: So, James, ignoring James 2, where he found out that James is just fucked up in his own way, the way that episode played out, it's pretty obvious that she brought him along to be cannon fodder.

1418
01:05:04,851 --> 01:05:07,730
Rym: So it wasn't just that he died and he was expendable, so she made the choice.

1419
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:14,929
Rym: She brought him to be expendable and then had to basically knock Finn out so she could expend him without him stopping her.

1420
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:15,933
Scott: Well, that's her move.

1421
01:05:15,973 --> 01:05:27,770
Scott: is that she's basically so much smarter than everybody and knows it, She knows it, but she can't possibly like, even if she's talking to banana guards, it's like, even if she's talking to Finn, she can't just say anything smart.

1422
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:30,349
Scott: Imagine being so smart and literally everyone is dumb.

1423
01:05:30,831 --> 01:05:38,769
Rym: Like, imagine if you were the only not crazy conservative person trying to explain to Finn or to Jake why Flame Princess is dangerous.

1424
01:05:39,971 --> 01:05:40,508
Guest: You just stop.

1425
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,410
Scott: So imagine how frustrating that is.

1426
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:45,290
Scott: Like you were literally the only intelligent person there is.

1427
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,688
Rym: So why doesn't she just go talk to Prismo?

1428
01:05:47,941 --> 01:05:48,230
Rym: I guess.

1429
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:49,187
Rym: Well, I guess now she can't.

1430
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:50,337
Scott: Well, that's why she hangs with.

1431
01:05:50,357 --> 01:05:53,289
Scott: Marceline is like the only thing even close to being smart because she's so old.

1432
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,028
Rym: Marceline is always kind of a bitch to her.

1433
01:05:55,502 --> 01:05:55,609
Scott: Yeah.

1434
01:05:55,871 --> 01:05:56,569
Guest: Oh, they're getting better.

1435
01:05:56,997 --> 01:05:57,349
Rym: They are.

1436
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,090
Guest: Last time they hung out, it was really actually pretty friendly.

1437
01:06:01,092 --> 01:06:06,130
Rym: I miss Marceline not being pissed off and sad and just causing trouble for people.

1438
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:11,369
Guest: Yeah, they're evolving her character into more of a good guy instead of this chaotic neutral thing.

1439
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:15,210
Rym: She was always chaotic neutral with good tendencies, even from the beginning.

1440
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:23,550
Rym: All of her pranks were funny and chaotic, but they weren't just chaotic neutral because she actually did prevent real harm from coming.

1441
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:25,847
Scott: I think the very first Marceline episode ever, right?

1442
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:30,230
Scott: At that point, I don't think she was meant to be this long recurring character, right?

1443
01:06:30,493 --> 01:06:31,629
Guest: She killed Jake in her first.

1444
01:06:31,893 --> 01:06:32,007
Guest: Right.

1445
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:36,090
Scott: In that very first episode, she knew she wouldn't kill one kind of character.

1446
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:40,628
Scott: And then when they decided to make her recurring, they switched it up right in that second appearance.

1447
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,790
Scott: They're like, oh, OK, she's just fooling around.

1448
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,729
Scott: She's not actually just a one off bad guy monster of the week.

1449
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:56,469
Rym: I just I miss episodes like when Finn needs help with his relationship stuff and she gives him the worst possible relationship advice in the world.

1450
01:06:57,493 --> 01:06:58,829
Guest: Yeah, that's because she was jealous.

1451
01:06:59,191 --> 01:07:05,686
Rym: Yeah, of course, even in that episode, look at the way she reacted to Finn asking her to go.

1452
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:11,550
Rym: She's got a lot more issues than just her issues with Peeves and her issues with Simon.

1453
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,049
Guest: He has a thousand years of issues.

1454
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:13,983
Rym: Yep.

1455
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:15,709
Rym: Daddy issues.

1456
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:17,490
Scott: French fry issues.

1457
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,689
Guest: Who knows how many exes she's had.

1458
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:20,219
Rym: Yeah.

1459
01:07:21,111 --> 01:07:24,689
Rym: Granted, we the only one we've seen is the douchebag guy.

1460
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:25,870
Scott: Oh, yeah.

1461
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:27,009
Scott: The guy, the band guy.

1462
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,549
Rym: We haven't seen any of the other ones.

1463
01:07:29,172 --> 01:07:29,775
Rym: But we've.

1464
01:07:30,016 --> 01:07:33,150
Rym: we've seen like Peeves was dating that one candy guy at one point.

1465
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:37,090
Guest: Yeah, she probably made him just saying, yeah, almost definitely.

1466
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:40,088
Rym: It's possible that two other candy people made him the natural way.

1467
01:07:40,992 --> 01:07:43,550
Scott: That would be really that that is a thing that happens, right?

1468
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:44,749
Scott: Like there's those candy orphans.

1469
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,229
Guest: Yeah, that is the thing that happens.

1470
01:07:46,633 --> 01:07:48,208
Guest: He was there really early on, though.

1471
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:52,850
Guest: I kind of when she was still building stuff, I kind of get the feeling she thought I should have a boyfriend.

1472
01:07:53,413 --> 01:07:54,210
Guest: What should I do about that?

1473
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:59,329
Rym: Or maybe she made a bunch of them and then one of them was just kind of and she just put up with him.

1474
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:06,030
Rym: I get the impression that anyone she has dated over this whole time, she's just kind of put up with like the kind of there.

1475
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:12,990
Guest: Do you remember in Lemonhope that that guy who helped Lemonhope out of flannel boxing day, I mean, Princess Bubblegum in disguise.

1476
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:13,430
Rym: Yeah.

1477
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:22,268
Guest: You remember when he he she was talking about romance and he was like, it's been so long and he starts dropping the paddle he was using.

1478
01:08:23,731 --> 01:08:24,950
Rym: I forgot all about that.

1479
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,528
Guest: I cracked up so hard at that.

1480
01:08:27,215 --> 01:08:28,890
Rym: So is she thinking back to Marceline or?

1481
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:30,709
Guest: That's what I like to think, but who knows?

1482
01:08:34,274 --> 01:08:34,950
Scott: All right.

1483
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:37,509
Scott: Let's end with something lighter, right?

1484
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:39,569
Scott: So what?

1485
01:08:41,071 --> 01:08:41,386
Scott: I don't know.

1486
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,102
Scott: Something lighter.

1487
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:43,270
Rym: Something lighter.

1488
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:44,359
Rym: Okay.

1489
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,850
Guest: Scott, what do you like most about Chews Goose?

1490
01:08:48,554 --> 01:08:49,629
Scott: What do I like most about Chews Goose?

1491
01:08:49,952 --> 01:08:50,040
Scott: Yeah.

1492
01:08:50,859 --> 01:08:51,189
Scott: His neck.

1493
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,850
Guest: I want to see some Scott X Chews Goose fan fiction.

1494
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:55,988
Rym: Guys, get on this.

1495
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:56,488
Scott: Make it.

1496
01:08:57,229 --> 01:08:59,010
Scott: Also, I like his his his equipment.

1497
01:08:59,390 --> 01:08:59,648
Scott: It's very.

1498
01:09:00,711 --> 01:09:01,729
Rym: You just like making that noise.

1499
01:09:02,033 --> 01:09:02,930
Scott: I like making that noise.

1500
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:03,394
Scott: And I like.

1501
01:09:03,656 --> 01:09:04,908
Scott: I like inventories.

1502
01:09:07,332 --> 01:09:10,488
Scott: Hook me up with that plus two armors and that plus five swords.

1503
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:15,229
Scott: For whatever reason, I really like Chews Goose will never give you the cursed shit.

1504
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:20,010
Rym: I think Flame Princess is actually my favorite non-main character.

1505
01:09:20,774 --> 01:09:21,430
Guest: Yeah, she's your type.

1506
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:22,584
Rym: Yeah, she kind of is.

1507
01:09:23,457 --> 01:09:23,707
Scott: All right.

1508
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:24,307
Scott: Favorite princess.

1509
01:09:25,109 --> 01:09:25,569
Rym: Favorite princess.

1510
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:27,970
Rym: But she's not a princess.

1511
01:09:28,171 --> 01:09:28,830
Rym: That's just her surname.

1512
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,069
Rym: That was that was explicitly stated.

1513
01:09:34,334 --> 01:09:35,450
Guest: Yes, God, you got to think harder.

1514
01:09:35,729 --> 01:09:36,950
Rym: You've got to pick a princess princess.

1515
01:09:38,732 --> 01:09:40,810
Guest: We'll just say Scott's favorite is Princess Princess Princess.

1516
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:41,206
Guest: Yeah.

1517
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:42,948
Scott: Is there such a princess?

1518
01:09:43,232 --> 01:09:43,341
Rym: Yes.

1519
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:46,050
Rym: She's three princesses like mashed together.

1520
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:46,729
Rym: She's horrifying.

1521
01:09:47,109 --> 01:09:47,988
Scott: I don't remember that one at all.

1522
01:09:49,673 --> 01:09:51,970
Scott: Well, I guess LSP isn't a princess either.

1523
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:52,260
Scott: Nope.

1524
01:09:52,698 --> 01:09:52,830
Scott: Right.

1525
01:09:53,872 --> 01:09:55,430
Rym: Because Princess means something in this world.

1526
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:58,270
Rym: We know that because of the Enchiridion.

1527
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:00,788
Guest: So we know that a little bit because of the video game, too.

1528
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:02,749
Scott: Does video game count?

1529
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:06,130
Rym: I know scenes count, but fuck the rest of that game.

1530
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:06,889
Guest: Fuck that game.

1531
01:10:07,211 --> 01:10:08,930
Scott: All the games are more than one of them.

1532
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,489
Rym: Those games are the worst.

1533
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,930
Guest: I gave up on it and just watched the rest of the season on YouTube.

1534
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:14,389
Rym: I can't believe you even bought it.

1535
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:15,488
Guest: I was trying to be a good fan.

1536
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:16,770
Scott: No, the first one.

1537
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:17,788
Scott: So don't reward them.

1538
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:23,630
Rym: That would be like if the creators of Cowboy Bebop came to America and just shit on their individual fans one by one.

1539
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:25,650
Guest: Some people have to learn their own lessons, Ram.

1540
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:26,730
Guest: That's the path to adulthood.

1541
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:31,387
Rym: Except if Finn was allowed to learn his own lessons, he would have died like 15 times.

1542
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:33,889
Scott: Well, we need your favorite princess also.

1543
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:35,690
Rym: And it can't be Marceline.

1544
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:36,570
Rym: She's not a princess either.

1545
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:37,728
Guest: My favorite princess is Peebs.

1546
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:38,288
Scott: Really?

1547
01:10:38,616 --> 01:10:38,704
Scott: Yes.

1548
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,288
Scott: Sorry.

1549
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:40,115
Rym: Okay.

1550
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:42,250
Rym: She's the most interesting character on that show.

1551
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,229
Guest: What are you all groaning for?

1552
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,369
Rym: I guess in Tenchi Muyo, you're like Iyeka the most.

1553
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,630
Guest: That is not even a remotely...

1554
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:49,690
Scott: That's like having Sailor Moon be your favorite Sailor Scout.

1555
01:10:50,596 --> 01:10:51,028
Guest: No, no.

1556
01:10:52,973 --> 01:10:53,970
Rym: Who's your favorite Sailor Scout?

1557
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:54,925
Rym: It's Michiru, isn't it?

1558
01:10:56,093 --> 01:10:56,589
Scott: The green one.

1559
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:57,608
Scott: Just because green.

1560
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,148
Guest: No, I like Sailor Uranus.

1561
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:00,726
Rym: Oh, okay.

1562
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,769
Scott: Because butt jokes.

1563
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:02,558
Guest: Yes.

1564
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:04,889
Rym: Yes, that is exactly why.

1565
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:08,430
Guest: No, Princess Bubblegum is the most complex character on that show.

1566
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:10,710
Guest: You're not going to convince me of otherwise in this short conversation.

1567
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:14,890
Guest: And just because she appears more than any other princess doesn't mean that my decision is lazy.

1568
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:16,008
Rym: No, I can see that.

1569
01:11:16,394 --> 01:11:16,810
Rym: I can see that.

1570
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:19,490
Rym: I like her a lot, but for whatever reason, I like Flame Princess more.

1571
01:11:20,178 --> 01:11:20,869
Guest: Yeah, whatever reason.

1572
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,268
Rym: I really don't know why.

1573
01:11:22,694 --> 01:11:24,490
Rym: I couldn't really... I'd have to think about it a lot.

1574
01:11:24,711 --> 01:11:26,389
Guest: That's the second most lazy answer, by the way.

1575
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:32,690
Rym: If I had to pick a non-lazy answer, I kind of like Slime Princess as well.

1576
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:33,687
Scott: Yeah.

1577
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:36,590
Rym: Because one, she just seems pretty rational and funny.

1578
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:40,870
Guest: And because Maria Bamford's doing her sexy voice for Slime Princess.

1579
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:49,886
Rym: I also liked at the end of that episode the way they handled the knot attraction between the two of them.

1580
01:11:52,486 --> 01:11:52,710
Scott: All right.

1581
01:11:53,093 --> 01:11:54,009
Rym: No love for Hot Dog Princess.

1582
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:55,830
Guest: I like her design.

1583
01:11:56,290 --> 01:12:00,807
Scott: Hot Dogs, like the theme of Hot Dog Princess is probably the best, but she's just sort of...

1584
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:04,230
Rym: Wildberry Princess with her stocks of murdered meat.

1585
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:04,885
Scott: Yeah, no.

1586
01:12:05,971 --> 01:12:08,590
Rym: I love how she just is really into meat and slaughtering.

1587
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:10,610
Scott: Maybe the Library Turtle Princess is acceptable.

1588
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:11,749
Rym: Turtle Princess, really?

1589
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:13,068
Scott: Hey, girl.

1590
01:12:13,855 --> 01:12:14,404
Scott: Hey, girl.

1591
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:16,028
Rym: Hey, girl.

1592
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:17,730
Rym: That was my ringtone for a while.

1593
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:18,968
Scott: That's not a bad ringtone.

1594
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,670
Rym: But now I've changed it to Don't Lose Your Way.

1595
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:21,829
Scott: That's a good ringtone, too.

1596
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:22,988
Rym: I might never change it again.

1597
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:25,310
Rym: Because then I'll lose my way.

1598
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:26,609
Scott: I should change mine to UY Shock.

1599
01:12:28,433 --> 01:12:29,770
Rym: It's also my alarm in the morning.

1600
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:30,324
Scott: Great.

1601
01:12:31,071 --> 01:12:32,030
Guest: That's a great idea.

1602
01:12:32,453 --> 01:12:32,624
Rym: Yeah.

1603
01:12:33,171 --> 01:12:33,648
Rym: I have two.

1604
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,470
Rym: I have one that's just Don't Lose Your Way.

1605
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:36,930
Scott: I'm still using the Tribes 2 song.

1606
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:39,008
Rym: It starts right up with the "Don't lose your

1607
01:12:39,069 --> 01:12:39,230
Rym: way.".

1608
01:12:40,173 --> 01:12:40,970
Rym: That's the ringtone.

1609
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:42,554
Rym: The alarm.

1610
01:12:42,635 --> 01:12:45,870
Rym: one plays the song slowly fading in, fading in, fading in, fading in.

1611
01:12:46,893 --> 01:12:47,347
Scott: Don't lose.

1612
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:49,085
Rym: So I have time to stop it.

1613
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,408
Guest: Wow, I would fly out of bed and right into the dresser.

1614
01:12:52,992 --> 01:12:54,430
Rym: Yeah, I thought I would do that.

1615
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:55,129
Rym: You know what happens?

1616
01:12:55,431 --> 01:12:56,610
Rym: I listen to the song for a while.

1617
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:57,189
Rym: I turn it off.

1618
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:57,950
Rym: I fall back asleep.

1619
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:58,990
Rym: I wake up a half hour later.

1620
01:12:59,090 --> 01:12:59,547
Rym: I'm late to work.

1621
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,170
Guest: Oh, you suck.

1622
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,489
Rym: I'm just... I can't get out of bed.

1623
01:13:04,616 --> 01:13:05,630
Rym: Is there a sleepy princess?

1624
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:06,770
Rym: I guess that would be the pillow princess.

1625
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:07,770
Rym: But that's alternate universe.

1626
01:13:08,011 --> 01:13:08,590
Scott: That's Prismo.

1627
01:13:11,075 --> 01:13:11,610
Rym: Rest in peace.

1628
01:13:11,991 --> 01:13:12,583
Rym: Oh, Prismo.

1629
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,850
Rym: Is it just me or was the Lich creepy as fuck in that episode?

1630
01:13:16,213 --> 01:13:17,509
Guest: He's always creepy as fuck, but yeah.

1631
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:19,350
Rym: He was extra creepy in that episode.

1632
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:23,750
Scott: I think ever since he donned the skin of Billy, it's been more creepy.

1633
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:24,870
Guest: He was creeping out Death.

1634
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,646
Rym: I love that scene where Death is like,

1635
01:13:26,686 --> 01:13:26,868
Rym: "Yeah.".

1636
01:13:28,732 --> 01:13:29,789
Rym: Also, Death might be...

1637
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:31,570
Scott: Couldn't Death just kill him because he's Death?

1638
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,210
Rym: Death's powers seem to be surprisingly limited.

1639
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:40,610
Scott: And what's Death... Like, is the dimension that Death lives in the same place where Marceline's dad lives?

1640
01:13:40,631 --> 01:13:41,026
Rym: God, no.

1641
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:41,255
Guest: No.

1642
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:42,330
Scott: No, okay.

1643
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:43,989
Rym: That's pretty well established, I think.

1644
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:50,690
Rym: Marceline's dimension... Well, Marceline's dad's dimension is the nightosphere is pretty much sequestered off from everywhere.

1645
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:52,350
Scott: So the nightosphere is not the same as Hell?

1646
01:13:52,634 --> 01:13:52,746
Guest: No.

1647
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:53,350
Scott: Okay.

1648
01:13:53,631 --> 01:13:56,470
Guest: It's kind of like Hell, but I don't know if that's where dead people go.

1649
01:13:56,731 --> 01:13:57,329
Scott: It's its own thing.

1650
01:13:57,631 --> 01:13:58,509
Scott: We haven't seen any Heavens.

1651
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:59,404
Scott: We've just seen two Hells.

1652
01:14:00,272 --> 01:14:01,149
Rym: Bad places to go.

1653
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:06,650
Rym: I guess your options are get sent to a Hell or get reincarnated as basically the same person.

1654
01:14:12,631 --> 01:14:14,750
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1655
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:19,890
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1656
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:25,310
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1657
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:28,230
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1658
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:32,990
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1659
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:36,506
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1660
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:40,810
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1661
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:43,930
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
