1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,602
Rym: Oh fuck, we're back.

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:02,550
Rym: Finally.

3
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:04,790
Scott: Oh, you started the show when I was looking out the window.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,169
Rym: I guess we should do the opening, actually.

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:18,056
Rym: It's Wednesday, April 23rd, 2014.

6
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:18,478
Rym: I'm Rym.

7
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:22,290
Scott: I'm Scott.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,916
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

9
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:26,970
Rym: Tonight, Kill la Kill, final thoughts.

10
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:29,408
Scott: I guess we still do this show.

11
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,269
Scott: Let's do this.

12
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:43,158
Rym: Yeah, I was in Paris, then we were at PAX, then all the stuff that happens after a PAX, like recovering and laundry and...

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,480
Scott: The sun coming out.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,000
Rym: Yep, it'd be a nice outside, biking everywhere.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,240
Scott: I took a day off work yesterday, went to the park, and burned my head.

16
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:55,139
Rym: I should have taken a day off just to bike around or something, but I didn't.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:55,796
Rym: Mistake.

18
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:56,580
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

19
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:57,469
Scott: Why live?

20
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:58,179
Scott: Why work?

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,810
Rym: Got one more weekend at a convention.

22
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,220
Rym: we'll talk about later, then we're pretty free.

23
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:04,157
Scott: Yay.

24
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:07,752
Rym: So this morning, something happened to me.

25
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:13,139
Rym: that's only happened to me twice in my life, and I always forget that this is a thing that can happen until it does happen.

26
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:17,800
Rym: So around 5 AM, I hear the fire alarm go off.

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,420
Scott: You weren't sleeping?

28
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:20,739
Rym: Well, I'm woken up by it.

29
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:28,559
Rym: I guess I heard it in my dream, and then it didn't make sense, and then I woke up and I hear it, but then it stops.

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,140
Rym: And then I hear a voice, a robot voice, yell something.

31
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:32,640
Scott: What?

32
00:01:33,102 --> 00:01:36,960
Scott: Does your fire alarm, your fire smoke alarm, your smoke detector has a robot voice?

33
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:37,519
Rym: Yeah, it does.

34
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:40,080
Rym: It's connected to other fire systems.

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,260
Rym: The whole building's integrated.

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,920
Rym: So it looks like a regular fire alarm up there in a hallway, but actually it's got a wire, and it connects to all the other smoke detectors in our apartment.

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,998
Rym: So if one goes off, they all go off.

38
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:52,119
Rym: Standard deal.

39
00:01:54,224 --> 00:02:00,014
Rym: So I just kind of lay there for a minute, and then it goes off again, and then I hear the voice, and it says, "Battery

40
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:00,476
Rym: low!".

41
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:01,577
Scott: Eh.

42
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:04,320
Scott: Wait, isn't it powered by the building?

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,859
Rym: No, well, so.

44
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:10,460
Scott: And then the battery is just a backup because that way it works during a power outage?

45
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:18,000
Rym: Yes, but the batteries still get drained a little bit and eventually wear out, and about once every year-ish, you're supposed to replace the 9-volt battery.

46
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:18,460
Scott: Of course.

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,580
Scott: Everyone, check your smoke detectors so you don't die in a horrible fire.

48
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:33,371
Rym: Yeah, well, smoke detectors usually, though I'm really shocked at how many people don't seem to know this, when I was a kid, I'd go over to people's houses, because normally when the battery's low on a regular old smoke detector, it'll chirp.

49
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:34,256
Rym: Like, boop!

50
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:37,820
Rym: Every few minutes until you change the battery.

51
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,298
Scott: But you can push the button to shut it up.

52
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:40,359
Rym: No, usually not.

53
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,859
Rym: Usually it'll start up again at some point.

54
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,131
Rym: Okay.

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,837
Rym: So I remember as a kid, a lot of people had smoke detectors that basically chirped forever because they didn't notice it.

56
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:51,020
Scott: Uh, much like your Fios battery.

57
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,660
Rym: Yeah, well, much like the Fios batteries in a lot of our neighbors' apartments.

58
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:55,138
Scott: Yep.

59
00:02:55,703 --> 00:03:01,699
Rym: Yeah, I have a feeling I'll be hearing the alarms of all my neighbors' Fios batteries being dead until I move.

60
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:09,098
Rym: So this thing still needs the backup battery to be replaced about once every year, even though it's powered by the AC.

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,900
Rym: And there's no way to suppress this fucking alarm.

62
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:15,439
Scott: A new battery.

63
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,700
Rym: Yeah, it didn't happen to have a 9-volt battery laying around.

64
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,120
Scott: But if your smoke detector, like, actually died, and it was a fire at, like, 5.30 and you didn't replace it.

65
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,840
Rym: Well, if it died, died, one, it still would have had power to wake me up.

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,359
Rym: I mean, the "Hey, the battery's dying" alarm would wake me up.

67
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,740
Rym: So that would have worked fine.

68
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:34,520
Rym: There's no way to suppress this alarm.

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,378
Scott: Doesn't know what time it is.

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,477
Rym: And it doesn't go, yeah, doesn't know what time it is.

71
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:39,840
Rym: Thinks it's a perfectly fine time to do this.

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,380
Scott: Listen, if you want to make a lot of money, right?

73
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,300
Scott: There's that company, Nest.

74
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:45,160
Scott: So make the Nest of smoke detectors.

75
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,920
Rym: Nest makes smoke detectors, Scott.

76
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:48,318
Scott: Oh, well, just buy it from them.

77
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,060
Rym: I don't own this apartment.

78
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,138
Scott: That's not my problem.

79
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:57,960
Rym: So I think what annoyed me about this was, you know, I'd rather these things fail loud than fail quiet.

80
00:03:58,481 --> 00:03:59,478
Rym: That's how it's supposed to be.

81
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:04,300
Rym: And if you live in a house, you don't notice this kind of stuff, not super sympathetic when your house burns.

82
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:04,960
Scott: We live in New York.

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,320
Scott: You can go to the 24/7 bodega, get a 9-volt battery.

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,327
Rym: Yeah, but at 5

85
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:08,489
Rym: a.m.,

86
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:09,459
Rym: I don't want to go do that.

87
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,599
Scott: Well, don't burn your house down.

88
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:11,970
Rym: Yeah.

89
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:20,959
Rym: So what annoyed me was that this repeated cycle of the super loud alarm telling me the battery is dying.

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,539
Scott: I notice he's not going off now.

91
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,220
Rym: Yeah, because I took care of that shit.

92
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,800
Scott: That's right.

93
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:27,729
Rym: It happened every 48 seconds.

94
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:31,380
Scott: You timed it with your stopwatch.

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,700
Rym: I laid there in bed going one, two, three, because I didn't want to get up.

96
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,780
Rym: And I wondered, can I just ignore this and deal with it when I get home?

97
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:40,460
Rym: Is it going to go off like once an hour?

98
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,799
Rym: No, every 48 to 50 seconds.

99
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:45,500
Rym: So that was my morning.

100
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:49,080
Rym: I found a dead 9-volt battery that wasn't quite dead.

101
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,920
Rym: So I swapped it and that delayed it until I could get a real battery.

102
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:54,054
Rym: That's my story.

103
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,899
Rym: That's the exciting life of a Rym.

104
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,020
Scott: I'm sure I have plenty of stories because we haven't done a show in a while, but who gives a shit?

105
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:01,616
Scott: Let's do some news.

106
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,039
Rym: All right, you got some news?

107
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,285
Scott: I do.

108
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:07,860
Scott: So the 2014 Eisner Award nominations are out.

109
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,796
Scott: Oh my gosh.

110
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,280
Scott: Well, yeah, obviously, right?

111
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:15,260
Scott: You can read the nominations yourselves, right?

112
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,360
Scott: But I'm going to go down this list and let's talk about some notable things, right?

113
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:22,340
Scott: Notable thing number one, saga's all over this list.

114
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,540
Scott: Best continuing series.

115
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,959
Scott: What else is it nominated for?

116
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,600
Scott: Best continuing series.

117
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,919
Scott: Keep going.

118
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:31,819
Scott: Keep going.

119
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:34,020
Rym: Keep going.

120
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,239
Rym: You know, this prepped it all.

121
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:37,600
Scott: I mean, it's you got to go down this whole list here.

122
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,640
Scott: It's not, you know, best writer.

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,670
Rym: No, you didn't just do a control F.

124
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,750
Scott: Best cover artist.

125
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,810
Scott: I can't on this iPad.

126
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:50,768
Scott: Ho, ho, ho, ho.

127
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,248
Scott: At least not, I don't know how to.

128
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,950
Rym: Highfalutin iPad can't do a grip through a file, eh?

129
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:56,610
Scott: I'm sure it can.

130
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,009
Rym: That's exciting right there.

131
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,646
Scott: Yeah.

132
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,208
Scott: All right.

133
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,049
Scott: It's got at least three.

134
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,350
Rym: My superior PC can do this.

135
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,350
Scott: Yeah, that's going to take all its categories for sure.

136
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,430
Rym: Best continuing series, best new series, best writer.

137
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:08,069
Rym: Only those three.

138
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,450
Scott: Yeah.

139
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:11,530
Scott: That Hawkeye comic is all over the place, right?

140
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:12,930
Rym: People have said that's really good.

141
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:14,589
Scott: Everyone says it's really good.

142
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:16,330
Scott: It's nominated for a million Eisner Awards.

143
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:19,803
Scott: It's even got like best single issue and shit like that, right?

144
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,650
Scott: It's all over the place.

145
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,330
Scott: It's even in more categories than Saga.

146
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,669
Rym: Is that the one we read a little bit?

147
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,470
Rym: I'm trying to remember.

148
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:28,006
Scott: No, I've never read it.

149
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,230
Rym: I think I read a different Hawkeye.

150
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,090
Scott: The reason I've never read it is because by Matt Fraction.

151
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,890
Scott: And Matt Fraction is this guy where everyone says his comics are so great.

152
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,410
Scott: And tons of people just love him to craziness.

153
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:37,387
Scott: And he seems like a cool guy.

154
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,270
Scott: But every comic I've ever read of his, at least in my opinion, has been garbage.

155
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,349
Rym: Now bear in mind, we think a lot of things are garbage.

156
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:47,650
Scott: Right, but for some reason, everyone likes this guy that I don't like.

157
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,429
Scott: Anyway, other notable things.

158
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,970
Scott: Best limited series, Trillium's in there by Jeff LeBaron.

159
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:53,362
Rym: Oh, right.

160
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,310
Rym: Shit, I forgot all about Trillium.

161
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,990
Rym: I read the first floppy.

162
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,009
Scott: Waiting for that trade.

163
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:58,849
Rym: And it was great.

164
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,808
Scott: Waiting for the trade.

165
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:05,850
Scott: Best new series, you've got Lazarus by Greg Rucka.

166
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,810
Scott: Greg Rucka's awesome.

167
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,968
Rym: Yeah, I can dig him.

168
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:10,230
Scott: What else is going on that's exciting?

169
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,510
Scott: Mouse Guard has best publication for kids, which is interesting.

170
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:16,450
Scott: I don't know how much, I mean, kids can read it.

171
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,368
Scott: Is it for kids?

172
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,490
Scott: I would argue it's for everybody.

173
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,529
Rym: Dark things happen in it, but on the level that kids seem to like.

174
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,550
Scott: Sure, maybe.

175
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,870
Rym: It's scary, but it's also just little mouses doing a little mouse thing.

176
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,410
Scott: Vader's Little Princess is best humor publication.

177
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:33,470
Rym: I could agree with that.

178
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,849
Scott: I haven't read the other ones.

179
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,925
Scott: So it's like I, you know, I'm just pointing out the ones that I know mostly, right?

180
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:44,830
Scott: Another interesting thing is that the Oatmeal, right, by Inman, that webcomic, right?

181
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:55,050
Scott: It's nominated in the best digital webcomic category, but it's also got like best short story and I think it might even be nominated for something else, which is pretty interesting.

182
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,310
Scott: I think maybe the first time like a webcomic is in some other category besides best webcomic.

183
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:02,170
Rym: Oh, this list was multi-paginated.

184
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:13,210
Rym: Saga's got best continuing series nomination, best writer, best painter, multimedia artist for interior art and best cover artist for Fiona specifically.

185
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,849
Rym: And there's like, there's a bunch of notes next to this here.

186
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,420
Scott: Yep.

187
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,149
Scott: But yeah, there's a lot of interesting things in here.

188
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:27,350
Scott: You know, things that, I mean, those big Prince Valiant volumes that I bought, that's in the best archival collection projects.

189
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,028
Rym: Have you read those?

190
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:29,209
Scott: I've read the first one.

191
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:29,397
Scott: Huh?

192
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:30,649
Scott: It's really good.

193
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:31,119
Scott: Yeah.

194
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:32,869
Scott: It's like the best thing ever.

195
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,130
Rym: I remember as a kid, I was always dumbfounded by Prince Valiant.

196
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,687
Scott: Yeah, you know why?

197
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,210
Scott: Because you go to the newspaper and you get this one giant panel and you're like, what the fuck originally?

198
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,950
Scott: So the original Prince Valiant took up basically a whole newspaper page per comic.

199
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:47,150
Scott: They were gigantic, right?

200
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:53,570
Scott: So these collected editions that I'm buying are the size of these hardcovers that are the size of an old newspaper.

201
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:54,128
Scott: They're huge.

202
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:56,970
Scott: And it's like the original size printing, right?

203
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:58,210
Scott: From the beginning in order.

204
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,168
Scott: So you know what's happening, not like when you read in the newspaper and you're like, what's going on?

205
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,210
Scott: I've never read a Prince Valiant in my life.

206
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,028
Scott: Who are these people?

207
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:07,030
Scott: Is that Valiant or is that Valiant?

208
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:07,646
Scott: I don't know.

209
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,069
Scott: And it's like you won't even know what's going on.

210
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,330
Scott: And it was like this tiny small piece, right?

211
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,530
Scott: So it wasn't the Prince Valiant that we were reading in the newspaper as kids wasn't the original one, right?

212
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:18,788
Scott: It was some other one.

213
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:22,150
Scott: It was by later artists and writers, not the originals.

214
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:27,490
Scott: So anyway, but yeah, lots of interesting nominations here.

215
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,290
Scott: You know, you can't vote, I guess, but you can go and look and see who's nominated.

216
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,770
Scott: It'll be more interesting than, I guess, Tony Award nominations.

217
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,120
Rym: Yep.

218
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:50,490
Rym: I have a feeling if we haven't talked about them already, many of the things that win them we'll probably read and talk about because after Kill La Kill, there's like, I'm watching anime still, but there's not a, there's a hole in my anime.

219
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,338
Scott: This weird thing seems to happen a lot.

220
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:55,815
Scott: where it's like, you know, you go down and it's like most of these categories.

221
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:59,570
Scott: I've read at most one or two of, right?

222
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,690
Scott: In some categories, zero of, right?

223
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:05,770
Scott: And even the ones where I haven't read, it's like, I've heard of maybe one more than that.

224
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,610
Scott: So it's like 75% of the things in this list I've never heard of at all, period, right?

225
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:18,670
Scott: Yet when they come out with the awards in the end, usually it's the things I've heard of or have already read that win most of the time.

226
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,230
Rym: Well, to be fair, we have not been super paying attention to comics lately.

227
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:23,850
Scott: I know.

228
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:25,669
Rym: It's been gaming and anime season.

229
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,510
Scott: The thing is my buying comics rate is steady.

230
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:34,069
Scott: It never changes, but my reading comics rate goes way down and now I have all these comics to read, no time to read them.

231
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:40,630
Rym: My buying comics rate is extremely, it's on the level of, oh right, I was waiting for that comic to come to trades.

232
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,103
Rym: Amazon.

233
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,170
Rym: Is it on trades?

234
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:42,466
Rym: Yes.

235
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,882
Rym: Buy it at like 30 or 40% off.

236
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,088
Scott: Right.

237
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:46,950
Rym: That's why I caught up on all the My Little Pony.

238
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,209
Scott: So I think what I'm going to do is, you know, I'm going to try- Any adventure time.

239
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:51,650
Scott: Right.

240
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,890
Scott: What I'm going to do this summer is whenever I go biking, I'm going to bring comics.

241
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:58,170
Scott: That way I can read them in the park.

242
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,110
Rym: Bike to the park, read a comic, bike home.

243
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,486
Rym: That's right.

244
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,710
Scott: And that way I will efficiently read more comics.

245
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:13,869
Rym: If we do that, then I think we'll have to review a lot of comics because like I said, anime still going strong, but there's a little hole in my anime watching because Kill la Kill is gone.

246
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:22,270
Rym: So speaking of anime and these other things, if you didn't notice, an anime person did an adventure time episode.

247
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,810
Scott: Well, is going to or is working on or is almost done with?

248
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,670
Rym: It's already done, but it's not going to air right away because that's how things work.

249
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,349
Rym: It's not like animators finish your show and then it's on TV that day.

250
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,470
Rym: But the guy who's doing ping pong, which is kind of up our alley.

251
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:42,350
Scott: So shame on Rym.

252
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,990
Scott: Didn't know who Masaaki Yuasa was until like two seconds ago.

253
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,490
Scott: Even though people have basically been talking about his awesomeness for many moons.

254
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,269
Rym: Yeah, but there's a lot of people like that people talk about.

255
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,849
Scott: Sure, I guess.

256
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,090
Scott: But you're you're the one who's out of the loop.

257
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:57,650
Scott: All the other people who at least know about anime know who this is.

258
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,370
Rym: Yeah, I knew vaguely who it was, but I looked at his list of stuff.

259
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,450
Scott: A lot of the listeners probably have no clue who it is.

260
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,469
Rym: I looked at his list of stuff.

261
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:09,230
Rym: If you remove all the things where he can animated one episode, not super prolific yet.

262
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:16,730
Scott: No, he's not prolific, but he's just like, as soon as he did one thing, people are like, whoa, because he does shit crazy different from everyone else.

263
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,309
Scott: He's got a really distinctive style.

264
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,249
Rym: Well, way back there was that anime, a kimonozu man.

265
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,467
Scott: Right.

266
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,289
Scott: And it's like we really didn't know his name at the time or that he was the one responsible, but it stood out.

267
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:30,430
Scott: So since then, he's done a bunch of other stuff and is doing more stuff.

268
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:33,190
Scott: So ping pong is the big thing he's doing at the moment.

269
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:36,250
Rym: Yeah, I think ping pong now is why I'm going to get really excited about it.

270
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,228
Rym: They got ping pong.

271
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:37,546
Rym: Yeah.

272
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,428
Rym: One, I play ping pong.

273
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:44,669
Rym: So that that might be for me, kind of like your Shonen boys on bike show is for you.

274
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:46,950
Rym: Yeah, but yeah.

275
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,350
Scott: So from what I gather, probably give me a better show.

276
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,190
Rym: This Adventure Time episode that he did, he wrote it, storyboarded it and directed it.

277
00:12:54,751 --> 00:13:01,290
Rym: And apparently he had zero restrictions on what the episode consisted of.

278
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,729
Rym: He was told to just go nuts and do whatever he wanted to do.

279
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,610
Scott: I'm sure he didn't interfere with the overarching plot and just made a one off.

280
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,809
Rym: I wonder what they would have done if he had come back to them like, all right, this is this is my storyboard.

281
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:18,710
Rym: And it's like Finn dying and then being reincarnated in the 80s and becomes a detective.

282
00:13:19,055 --> 00:13:20,109
Rym: And that's the entire episode.

283
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,850
Scott: They would have just had to be that and then moved on.

284
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,670
Scott: The same way Cowabeebop did with the alien in the fridge episode.

285
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,770
Scott: Yeah, they all died.

286
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,710
Scott: Up next episode.

287
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,470
Scott: Nothing happened.

288
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:29,010
Rym: They didn't die.

289
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,869
Rym: They were just taking a coma and the ship was already set to guide toward that waypoint where there would have been doctors.

290
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:35,610
Scott: Sure.

291
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,769
Scott: Whatever you say.

292
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:37,589
Rym: That could have worked out.

293
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,328
Scott: Whatever you say.

294
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,989
Rym: It's not like Samurai Champloo where it just didn't make any fucking sense.

295
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,510
Rym: So this adventure time episode will be interesting.

296
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,669
Rym: Ping pong will be interesting and we'll see where this guy goes.

297
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:50,650
Scott: He's already gone.

298
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:52,409
Scott: You're just the only one who has it.

299
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:53,950
Rym: I'm saying he hasn't done a lot yet.

300
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,210
Rym: Let's see where he's done a lot.

301
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:02,289
Scott: But everything that Misaki Wasa has done has been critically acclaimed and known and recognized by the whole anime community, even in the US.

302
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:03,889
Scott: And you were the only one who hasn't noticed.

303
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:09,470
Rym: Yeah, I'm sure everyone in the US is really excited about Photo Kano episode seven.

304
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:11,650
Scott: He did Kick Heart.

305
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,470
Scott: His Kickstarter was huge and all over the anime news everywhere.

306
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:14,946
Scott: Yeah.

307
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:21,470
Scott: He did Mind Game, a highly lauded and very much celebrated Studio 4C production.

308
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:22,250
Scott: Right.

309
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:24,589
Scott: Was a big deal when it happened.

310
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,008
Scott: Is not this unknown person.

311
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,537
Rym: You are just failing to admit that you were just in the dark.

312
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,790
Scott: Everybody knows who Misaki Wasa is already.

313
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,150
Scott: One already a big deal.

314
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,128
Scott: He's not going places.

315
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,409
Scott: He is places now.

316
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,190
Rym: I didn't say he wasn't a big deal.

317
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,649
Scott: You said you'll see where he goes.

318
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,009
Rym: Basically, what's he going to do next?

319
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,830
Rym: Give him ten years.

320
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:46,827
Rym: What else is he going to do?

321
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:50,945
Scott: You are just simply someone who does not know and will not admit.

322
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:51,729
Scott: you do not know.

323
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:53,790
Rym: I wasn't super up on him.

324
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:54,589
Rym: What do you want me to say?

325
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,249
Scott: Now you have admitted the truth.

326
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:58,409
Scott: Everyone else knows already.

327
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,869
Rym: I have a feeling that most of the people listening have no idea about any of this.

328
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:04,069
Scott: We'll see.

329
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:07,470
Scott: Anyone in the anime community already knows.

330
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,910
Rym: Anyone in the anime community.

331
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,570
Rym: The anime community.

332
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,129
Scott: Exactly.

333
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,849
Rym: The anime community that doesn't even know.

334
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:15,469
Rym: Like they didn't know who Tomino was.

335
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,630
Rym: Only the Gundam people knew.

336
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,990
Scott: That's not the anime community.

337
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:19,290
Scott: That's the Homestuck community.

338
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,489
Rym: So you're talking about Anna Twitter.

339
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,086
Rym: Yes.

340
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:21,690
Rym: Okay.

341
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,050
Rym: That's not the anime community.

342
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:23,567
Scott: Yes, it is.

343
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,010
Rym: That's the people who tweet.

344
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,669
Rym: That's like Mike Tool, you, me, Daryl Surratt.

345
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:28,947
Scott: The real people.

346
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:29,367
Scott: Yeah.

347
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,130
Scott: Everybody knows.

348
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,370
Rym: Okay, Anna Twitter knows.

349
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,008
Rym: I'll give you that.

350
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,229
Scott: But you didn't, so you're not Anna Twitter, I guess.

351
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:35,827
Rym: Yeah.

352
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:37,070
Rym: I mean, I knew the name.

353
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,230
Rym: I just didn't think of all the things he'd done together.

354
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:42,150
Rym: I completely forgot about Kamonosume.

355
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,549
Rym: In fact, I pretty much always forget about that until I see it.

356
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,630
Rym: And I remember the girl with the big monster arm.

357
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:49,950
Scott: All his stuff looks like this.

358
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:50,119
Rym: Yeah.

359
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:53,609
Rym: Well, Ping Pong doesn't have monster arms yet.

360
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,850
Scott: It still looks like this.

361
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,929
Rym: So as a little aside, tiny news.

362
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:11,870
Rym: If you were mad about the bag checks at PAX or Anime Boston, or if you're mad about the fact that basically the city of Boston prevents Anime Boston from having their little anime rave or pretty much anything else weird that's happened in Boston.

363
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:19,389
Rym: Like, I don't know the fact that Boston forced PAX to have fewer women's restrooms and wouldn't let them make them gender neutral.

364
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:21,650
Rym: The mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh.

365
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,410
Scott: They let him have one or two gender neutral.

366
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:31,690
Rym: Yeah, they let him have one gender neutral in one area, and they refused to let them turn any of the other ones into gender neutral.

367
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:42,070
Rym: They just turned them without the cons real approval into men's bathrooms, thus causing women's bathroom deserts in certain parts of the convention.

368
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,809
Rym: And apparently the Boston response to complaints from PAX was, yeah, fuck you.

369
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,429
Rym: So the mayor of Boston's doing an AMA on Reddit.

370
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,032
Scott: It's not like.

371
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,150
Scott: he's going to respond to your question regarding this.

372
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,250
Rym: He's not going to respond to anyone.

373
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,904
Rym: These things already are going to be 99% about marijuana.

374
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,444
Rym: So I'd ask you to make this one 80% about marijuana, 20% about PAX and Anime Boston.

375
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,310
Scott: Okay, good luck.

376
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,229
Rym: That's what I'm shooting for.

377
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,306
Rym: Let's make sure that 100% of the questions are still questions.

378
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:12,304
Rym: he's not going to want to answer.

379
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:14,170
Scott: He's not going to answer.

380
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:20,500
Scott: Someone else is going to copy and paste pre written answers on things that he's already decided he wants to answer about is to look for the.

381
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:26,550
Scott: basically someone's job is going to take these answers, find the question they apply to and post it as a reply.

382
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:30,330
Scott: And after they posted every answer they've already pre written, stop answering.

383
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:31,309
Rym: Congratulations.

384
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:33,070
Rym: You have figured out politics.

385
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:34,048
Scott: Oh, my God.

386
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:38,070
Rym: It's still good to do these things anyway, because the more torrent there is, he'll have.

387
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,209
Scott: at least there's a naive person out there who this works on.

388
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:48,620
Rym: Now, what it is is they'll have an aide somewhere who keeps track of what people actually asked about and goes into some statistics folder.

389
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:50,250
Rym: that probably gets ignored.

390
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:52,768
Rym: So that's the impact we're shooting for.

391
00:17:54,371 --> 00:18:02,110
Rym: Or if nothing else, if you ask the really good question, it becomes a focal point itself of people who are mad, even though he'll never answer.

392
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,289
Rym: No one in the government will ever see it or look at it.

393
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:08,630
Rym: It gives you sort of a rallying point for your tiny marijuana driven cause.

394
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:10,930
Rym: It's mostly marijuana.

395
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:23,060
Rym: But anyway, things of the day, I found this area of YouTube and I'm going to link to it.

396
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,677
Rym: My thing of the day.

397
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:26,900
Rym: This is an hour, two hour long video.

398
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:30,720
Rym: And it's just a whole bunch of old Donald cartoons in a row.

399
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:31,175
Scott: That's yours.

400
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,460
Rym: Super high quality.

401
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:36,560
Scott: And more importantly, how is this not taken down by Disney?

402
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:37,336
Rym: What fucking knows?

403
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,956
Rym: These videos have been up for a long time.

404
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,080
Rym: It's got like 7 million views and there's a million of them.

405
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,300
Rym: Every old Disney cartoon is just right here.

406
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:44,800
Scott: All right.

407
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:45,680
Scott: Good job, Disney.

408
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,820
Rym: It was uploaded by Jeff and Dale.

409
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:49,660
Scott: Oh, maybe that's official.

410
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,296
Rym: Yeah.

411
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:50,779
Rym: I don't know.

412
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:51,718
Rym: I didn't really look into it.

413
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,660
Scott: Those are your best buddies.

414
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,000
Rym: Wow.

415
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:56,259
Rym: This video is almost as many dislikes as likes.

416
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:57,316
Scott: Okay.

417
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,120
Rym: That's interesting.

418
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:02,000
Rym: But these are not just any Disney videos.

419
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,279
Scott: They're the Nazi ones?

420
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,940
Rym: No, it's not the weird ones that are like not shown anywhere.

421
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:15,080
Rym: These are the ones that when I was a kid, I would rent from like video stores that predated Blockbuster on Beta fucking Max tapes.

422
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:16,420
Scott: Like Goofy playing golf?

423
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,053
Rym: Yeah.

424
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,519
Rym: These are like Goofy playing golf.

425
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:22,620
Rym: These are like the Donald Duck and Chip and Dale fighting over popcorn.

426
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,000
Rym: Like those kinds.

427
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:40,220
Rym: And the one thing I've noticed the most watching all these again as adult, Donald Duck plays the most dangerous game because in multiple of these, he has a goddamn rec room with a lot of dead animals on the walls, multiple shotguns.

428
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,998
Rym: And in one of them, he has all these duck lures just hanging out with a shotgun, just sitting right next to them.

429
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,198
Rym: What is Donald Duck up to?

430
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,300
Scott: Well, in the Warner Brothers universe, right?

431
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,320
Scott: Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny are getting hunted by Elmer Fudd all the time, right?

432
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:56,495
Scott: True.

433
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,300
Scott: In the Disney universe, there is no Elmer Fudd because Donald Duck murdered him and lives in his house.

434
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,540
Rym: Donald Duck also kind of an asshole, but.

435
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,940
Scott: Well, I mean, he's a sailor, so he knows how to shoot, right?

436
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:15,440
Scott: Not that you shoot too often in the Navy, but you shoot more than zero.

437
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,400
Rym: As much of an asshole as he is, Huey, Dewey and Louie are way more asshole.

438
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,800
Scott: Apple does not fall far from the other branch of the tree.

439
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:26,839
Rym: I was about to correct you just in case.

440
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:32,139
Rym: But like there's one where Donald Duck is just hanging out in this lighthouse, working the lighthouse, doing his thing.

441
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:34,280
Rym: And he sees another bird, a pelican asleep.

442
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,600
Rym: So he's like, well, fuck that guy.

443
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,819
Rym: He just points the lighthouse at him and starts fucking with him.

444
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:41,098
Rym: And then the pelican fucks him up.

445
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:41,656
Rym: The end.

446
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:44,779
Rym: And he pretty much deserved everything that happened to him.

447
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,480
Rym: These are a great way to kill two hours.

448
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,719
Scott: Now we don't have to watch him anymore.

449
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:51,180
Scott: He just told everything to happen.

450
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:55,580
Scott: So this is something I feel like might have been a thing of the day in the past.

451
00:20:57,081 --> 00:21:03,540
Scott: But it's like and it's something I've definitely seen before, but I found it again and it's awesome.

452
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,256
Scott: So who cares?

453
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,240
Scott: And I'm too lazy to look up whether it's actually a thing of the day in the past or not.

454
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,539
Scott: So I'll just read the text for you because it's very short.

455
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,937
Scott: Three space colony summer studies were conducted at NASA Ames in the 70s.

456
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,679
Scott: A number of artistic renderings of the concepts were made.

457
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,719
Scott: They have been scanned and are available here as small, medium, large and publication quality JPEG scans by some guy.

458
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,580
Scott: Images are not copyrighted.

459
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:31,139
Scott: Please credit photos to NASA Ames Research Center.

460
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:33,480
Scott: So I made some desktop wallpapers.

461
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,740
Scott: But yeah, these are basically just amazing artistic renderings of not real space colonies.

462
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:44,739
Scott: But you look at these and it's like, oh, that's where the Gundam space colony design came from.

463
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:48,260
Scott: Pretty much stolen directly from these or borrowed or whatever.

464
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,800
Scott: I guess since they're not copyrighted, not stolen either, right?

465
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,540
Scott: But yeah, here's your next desktop wallpaper for all your computers.

466
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,958
Scott: There are many to choose from.

467
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:06,740
Scott: Also, I really wonder how did the Gundam artists see these images that were made at NASA?

468
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,140
Scott: Like, how did they get around at the time?

469
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:11,780
Scott: Were they printed somewhere that they saw them in Japan?

470
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,880
Rym: Maybe they were in like a popular science or something like that.

471
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,839
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

472
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:17,179
Rym: Maybe they were part of.

473
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:22,500
Rym: Maybe the designs of these things were just somehow confluent.

474
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,859
Scott: Maybe it seems unlikely when you see the pictures.

475
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:27,853
Scott: It's like, no, there's no way.

476
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:32,939
Scott: because it's like, wow, that's a direct shot from War in the Pocket right there in that picture.

477
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,680
Rym: A space station shaped like a kid's butt with a slingshot.

478
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:42,020
Scott: Whoa, not that.

479
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:42,771
Scott: No, I know.

480
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:44,283
Rym: It just.

481
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:49,998
Rym: I was recently looking for a good picture of War in the Pocket and I couldn't find anything better than that.

482
00:22:51,522 --> 00:22:54,839
Rym: Anyway, so in the moment, the book club book is.

483
00:22:56,048 --> 00:22:56,720
Scott: Oh, the book club book.

484
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:59,140
Scott: I have chosen the book club book.

485
00:22:59,361 --> 00:22:59,638
Scott: I have.

486
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:10,818
Scott: So remember how we were talking about, you know, when we talked about wool, we talked about how wool is the same as fallout is the same as, you know, the other ones.

487
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,039
Rym: You've forgotten all the other examples.

488
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,339
Rym: Paranoia, Logan's run.

489
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,099
Scott: All those.

490
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,059
Scott: It's the same as all those.

491
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,211
Scott: Right.

492
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,199
Scott: Someone mentioned one that was another one of those.

493
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:22,240
Scott: Right.

494
00:23:22,862 --> 00:23:24,500
Scott: That I'd never heard of before.

495
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,160
Scott: And I was like, oh, that's interesting.

496
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,936
Scott: Another one of those.

497
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,898
Scott: But then, like, coincidentally, like a few days later, like Boing Boing made a post about it.

498
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:37,539
Scott: And I'm like, and I'm like, something must be up.

499
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:39,338
Scott: The antennas are up.

500
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,900
Scott: Something is happening.

501
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:42,339
Scott: So I'm like, you know what?

502
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:45,920
Scott: If the antennas are up, just why don't even hesitate.

503
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,616
Scott: Just go for it.

504
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:47,079
Scott: Right.

505
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:49,498
Scott: So let me let me read this here.

506
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:56,531
Scott: A Canticle for Liebowitz is a post apocalyptic science fiction novel, something from the 60s.

507
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,059
Scott: And I guess they said it's about the same thing.

508
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,700
Scott: And that's older than any of those other fucking ones.

509
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,080
Scott: Right.

510
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,877
Scott: You find one older than this.

511
00:24:05,682 --> 00:24:07,100
Rym: That's been on my radar for a while.

512
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,379
Rym: Emily's been bugging me to read it.

513
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,140
Rym: I think Luke was telling me that's what I heard at first from Luke.

514
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:12,659
Scott: And then I saw it on Boing Boing again.

515
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:15,537
Scott: So this is published in 59, not even the 60s.

516
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:20,639
Scott: So if that if this is one of those, this is probably the first one of those.

517
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:22,199
Scott: So then we don't have to read any more of those.

518
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:23,555
Scott: There you go.

519
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:24,938
Rym: Unless it's bad.

520
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:26,360
Scott: It's possible.

521
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,339
Rym: Then you got to keep reading them.

522
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,240
Scott: But why the fuck is everyone talking about it if it's so bad?

523
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,740
Rym: Probably because wool and all these other things have come out and people are really into that.

524
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,860
Scott: Also, our book club book seems to have a tradition of saying, this is the first one of those like Snow Crash.

525
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,879
Scott: This is the first one.

526
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,660
Scott: So we're going to read all the first ones.

527
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:47,956
Rym: Watch out, though, because there might be an urr version of this.

528
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:50,880
Rym: going back to like, I don't know, Stanislaw Lem might have written something.

529
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,120
Scott: You go find it for me.

530
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,218
Scott: We'll change a book club selection.

531
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:54,800
Rym: I'm down with this book.

532
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,540
Scott: Also, it's an old sci-fi novel.

533
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,419
Scott: I'm betting it's short.

534
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,780
Rym: Pretty sure I already own it.

535
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,660
Scott: I'm betting it's short.

536
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,200
Scott: I don't know how many pages.

537
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,758
Scott: It could be long.

538
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,395
Scott: I haven't read it.

539
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:02,872
Scott: All right.

540
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:03,917
Scott: But it could be.

541
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,400
Scott: I'm betting that it's not long.

542
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,867
Rym: So this weekend in Lancaster, It's 320 pages.

543
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,620
Rym: Pennsylvania.

544
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:14,060
Rym: We're going to be at Zenkai Con 2014.

545
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,860
Rym: It's a moderately sized anime con, especially for Pennsylvania.

546
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,559
Rym: Supposedly Lancaster has okay food, though.

547
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:21,000
Rym: It has Amish food.

548
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,820
Rym: We're told the food closes at like seven o'clock.

549
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:24,999
Scott: Well, Amish people.

550
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,579
Scott: They got to get home in their buggy.

551
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:28,860
Scott: Yeah, it takes a while.

552
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:33,616
Rym: So, yeah, we're taking the train out there on Saturday at 10 a.m.

553
00:25:33,697 --> 00:25:34,760
Rym: in Live 3.

554
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,159
Rym: We're doing anime openers from around the world.

555
00:25:37,863 --> 00:25:38,259
Scott: Exciting.

556
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:39,828
Rym: On Saturday at 1 30 p.m.

557
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:42,500
Rym: in Live 3.

558
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,884
Rym: We're doing.

559
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:44,420
Rym: all anime are the same.

560
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,200
Scott: I hope I still have it.

561
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,980
Rym: This one's also known as It's All Scott because he wrote the panel.

562
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,460
Rym: He put it together and he might have deleted all the source material.

563
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:56,480
Rym: If that's the case, I'll show up and we'll see what happens in this panel.

564
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,280
Scott: Just do something.

565
00:25:57,781 --> 00:25:58,880
Scott: No one will show up to our panel anymore.

566
00:25:59,081 --> 00:25:59,740
Scott: Yeah, they might.

567
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,300
Rym: That's a moderately provocative title.

568
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:02,855
Rym: Maybe.

569
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,629
Rym: And then on Sunday at 10 30

570
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:04,850
Rym: a.m.,

571
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:06,300
Rym: we are doing bad games.

572
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:07,398
Rym: Our panel from PAX.

573
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:08,519
Scott: Okay.

574
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,320
Rym: Well, the previous PAX.

575
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,558
Rym: The the previous previous PAX.

576
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,380
Rym: PAX Prime.

577
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,319
Rym: Because our most recent PAX panel was Why No One Will Game With You, which I got video of.

578
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,217
Rym: I'll see if I upload it.

579
00:26:19,422 --> 00:26:19,552
Rym: Okay.

580
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:20,918
Rym: I haven't gone through it too much yet.

581
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:22,115
Scott: Okay.

582
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,860
Rym: Yeah, I got two episodes of GeekNights Presents Utena that I just have to edit and upload.

583
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:29,258
Rym: They're already pretty much good to go.

584
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,780
Scott: I got three videos from the latest Netrunner tournament.

585
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,750
Scott: 20-sided store.

586
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:34,419
Scott: I have to upload.

587
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:36,539
Scott: But my upload is slow.

588
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:36,988
Scott: No.

589
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,259
Rym: For a small fee, I could upload it for you.

590
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,440
Scott: Oh, you know who won that tournament?

591
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:42,419
Rym: Uh, you.

592
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:42,877
Scott: Maybe.

593
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,213
Scott: Really?

594
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:43,674
Scott: Maybe.

595
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,198
Rym: All right.

596
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:45,000
Rym: Spoilers.

597
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,118
Rym: Spoilers.

598
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,800
Scott: There was no one there.

599
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,020
Scott: It was like six people total.

600
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:48,938
Rym: So Kill La Kill.

601
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:52,800
Rym: One, if you haven't watched Kill La Kill, don't listen because we're going to spoil it.

602
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:53,858
Rym: Final thoughts.

603
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,997
Rym: We're going to talk about the show as we watched it.

604
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,380
Rym: So seriously.

605
00:26:58,062 --> 00:26:59,900
Scott: Who hasn't watched the whole thing?

606
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,128
Rym: Who hasn't watched the whole thing?

607
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,740
Rym: who listens to an anime podcast?

608
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:03,776
Scott: Really?

609
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:04,958
Scott: Really?

610
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,740
Scott: Who has internet access to listen to podcasts, but doesn't have...

611
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,420
Rym: So here's what I've noticed among other people talking about Kill La Kill.

612
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:21,798
Rym: Unlike Attack on Titan, which had one wave of people who were really into it, and then the wave of everybody else watched it.

613
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:24,739
Rym: This one has a ton of tiny waves.

614
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,760
Rym: Like people were saying, oh, this is great.

615
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:28,780
Rym: We watched it.

616
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,680
Scott: We saw it coming a mile away because I saw all the other trigger things.

617
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,900
Scott: And I said, anything that says trigger on it, I will pull the trigger on.

618
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:42,979
Rym: But I saw a lot of other people who would watch one, two episodes and say things to the effect of this looks porny.

619
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:44,280
Rym: This looks dumb.

620
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,634
Rym: It does.

621
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,779
Rym: This looks crazy.

622
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:47,779
Rym: I'm not comfortable with this.

623
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,778
Rym: I'm not going to watch it.

624
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,099
Scott: In that first episode, I was like, oh my God, this nakedness.

625
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,655
Scott: But at the same time, I was like, that Kamigori.

626
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,920
Rym: Did Kamigori just jump off the side of the building?

627
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,077
Scott: I'm watching this show.

628
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:03,679
Rym: When he's there at the door at the bottom of that scene.

629
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,880
Rym: But then the many of those people who said these things would watch one or two more episodes.

630
00:28:11,262 --> 00:28:12,199
Scott: If they could be forced to.

631
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,099
Rym: And then they tweet something to the effect of, you know, I don't know, the show might actually be pretty good.

632
00:28:17,742 --> 00:28:21,899
Rym: And then they basically just blitz to the end and then talk about how it was one of the greatest things they've ever seen.

633
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:34,479
Rym: I've seen so many people go from not watching this to marathoned it over the course of five episodes, that if you have avoided the show for any reason, trust us, watch it.

634
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:45,579
Rym: Even if you get to the end and somehow still think that it is an objectively horrible show or you have serious beef with it, at least now you can argue with us about it.

635
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:49,418
Rym: It's a notable show, even if you don't like it.

636
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:50,998
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

637
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,979
Rym: Because it might have saved anime.

638
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,780
Rym: Well, this is Space Dandy.

639
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,879
Scott: How's anime doing right now?

640
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,598
Scott: Not that it's okay.

641
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:00,180
Rym: Anime is like, it's coming up, coming along.

642
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:00,819
Scott: It's doing okay.

643
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,120
Rym: Got to watch, I got to finish Space Dandy.

644
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,480
Rym: I didn't watch the last few episodes.

645
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,140
Scott: Well, you're going to get some more pretty soon.

646
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,409
Scott: I know.

647
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,056
Scott: A month or two.

648
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:07,694
Rym: Yeah.

649
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,319
Scott: April's almost over.

650
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:10,999
Rym: Oh, God.

651
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:11,478
Rym: Yeah, it is.

652
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,780
Rym: I mean, Adventure Time season six already started out.

653
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,220
Scott: That's right.

654
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:19,920
Rym: So Kill La Kill ended very well, in my opinion.

655
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:25,079
Rym: It was a show where had they flubbed the ending, it could have gone from A to B.

656
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:25,700
Scott: Right.

657
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,997
Scott: Well, I mean, the ending wasn't, like, I was expecting the ending to be like, boom, holy sugar.

658
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,059
Scott: But it wasn't.

659
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,480
Scott: It was really, the ending was really one or two episodes before the last episode.

660
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,740
Scott: And the last two episodes are just like, you know how it's going to end?

661
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:40,879
Scott: We're just going to do it.

662
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,939
Scott: Like, you know, we're going to do it.

663
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:42,660
Rym: And here it is.

664
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:48,100
Rym: We accept that it did not do the Eva existential thing that I expected it to do.

665
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,160
Scott: I didn't expect that at all.

666
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,038
Rym: I expected that.

667
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:51,740
Rym: Not to the level of Eva.

668
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,772
Scott: I just expected, like, oh, you know, it's like.

669
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:58,000
Scott: the show was so over the top and it was always one upping itself.

670
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,100
Scott: I thought it would one up itself and then two up itself and three up itself.

671
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,031
Scott: And at the end, 100 up itself.

672
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:03,739
Scott: But it didn't.

673
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,200
Scott: It just brought it up to the highest level and then maintained it for the last two to three episodes.

674
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:11,120
Scott: And I'm like, so the ending was sort of like, yep, that's the ending.

675
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,560
Scott: All right.

676
00:30:12,203 --> 00:30:13,495
Scott: As opposed to like, yeah.

677
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:36,118
Rym: But I guess what I expected of, say, three episodes before the end was something more like Big O because the show had a lot of these sort of metaphorical elements that I expected the ending to be something more along the lines of junketsu and Satsuki talking to each other.

678
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:40,740
Rym: And there being some sort of understanding between like some sort of dialogue with the life fibers.

679
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:42,498
Rym: And then that would have been the end.

680
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,440
Rym: And it was actually kind of refreshing that that didn't work.

681
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:49,038
Rym: And the real end was just fucking kill them all.

682
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:50,899
Rym: They were the bad guy.

683
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:51,634
Rym: The end.

684
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,240
Scott: Yeah.

685
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,340
Scott: Well, I mean, you know, the show, as much as it borrowed from things that we like, such as Ava, Nutenna and whatnot.

686
00:30:58,661 --> 00:30:59,659
Rym: It went its own way.

687
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:07,860
Scott: Well, that but it borrowed mostly from like Mazinger and that sort of, you know, going a guy type of thing more than the other things that borrowed from.

688
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:08,179
Scott: Right.

689
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Scott: So, of course, it ends with kill all the bad guys exploding and fighting.

690
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,020
Scott: Right.

691
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:16,040
Scott: As opposed to an Ava ending or a Nutenna ending.

692
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,208
Rym: Yep.

693
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:29,456
Rym: But at the same time, the kill everything ending has extra ramifications for this kind of story because all the characters we know and love, except for Ryuko, are just normal people now.

694
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,460
Scott: No, they're still crazy people.

695
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,140
Rym: Oh, they're crazy people, but they no longer have superpowers.

696
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,940
Scott: I guess someone could still.

697
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,620
Scott: Well, I mean, yeah, it's like, are there still any Goku uniforms anywhere?

698
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:41,957
Rym: Yeah.

699
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:49,380
Rym: They said that they would all basically, you know, not have power sources anymore and would die except for Yuko, I guess, because she's made of them.

700
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:56,279
Rym: And I guess she's just going to be a God in this world now because she might literally be the most powerful being in the entire earth at the end of the show.

701
00:31:56,426 --> 00:31:56,517
Rym: Yeah.

702
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,758
Scott: But like if all life fibers lose power, but they're still in her heart, is she dead or she didn't?

703
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,579
Scott: She's obviously not dead.

704
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:02,710
Scott: Right.

705
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,800
Rym: But it's like, well, because she's a perfect synthesis of life fibers and man.

706
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:08,237
Scott: Yeah.

707
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:14,816
Scott: I mean, if you really care about, you know, checking the growth of Gandalf in this show, you're not going to get too far.

708
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,959
Rym: Though the show gives you enough to debate it at length if you wish.

709
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:20,120
Scott: Yeah, go for it.

710
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,380
Rym: Look, look, everyone has a time in their life.

711
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:24,500
Scott: That's not the most important part of it.

712
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,920
Scott: It's far from it so no one cares.

713
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:34,580
Rym: Scott, there was a time when even you and I and other people would sit up late at night debating about the literal details of what happened in Evangelion.

714
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,219
Scott: But we know the answer to that.

715
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:36,595
Scott: Yes.

716
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,800
Scott: It's not a thing to debate.

717
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,980
Rym: And when we were younger, it was a thing to debate.

718
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,480
Rym: We were also younger.

719
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:45,419
Rym: And what I said, this is what I'm getting at.

720
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:48,620
Rym: There's a time in every young, all you 20 year olds can go into.

721
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:58,660
Rym: There's a time in every young person's life where they're going to watch a show like this and they're going to spend months debating with each other about the finer points of, well, what's the scissor used for now?

722
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,140
Rym: Could they synthesize life fibers from Ryuko?

723
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,920
Rym: Could that be the future of humanity?

724
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,380
Rym: Could young Katsu have been reasoned with?

725
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:07,940
Scott: Why does everyone wear normal clothes?

726
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,100
Scott: Everyone should just be naked now because.

727
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,615
Scott: Oh, yeah.

728
00:33:10,062 --> 00:33:10,292
Rym: Oh, yeah.

729
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:13,800
Scott: Did Nudist Beach fail because not everyone's just naked all the time?

730
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,380
Rym: But much like Eva, the literal plot was awesome, but was not the whole story.

731
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,600
Rym: Not the important part.

732
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:28,279
Rym: The important part was this is a story about a lot of really interesting characters who did a lot of really interesting and sometimes surprising things.

733
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,572
Scott: Yeah, it's not a lot of shows.

734
00:33:30,281 --> 00:33:33,360
Scott: They have like one core message and then like some supporting messages.

735
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,900
Scott: This show was more like three or four equally emphasized messages all side by side, right?

736
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:43,960
Scott: The message about clothing, the message about, you know, having crazy friends.

737
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,520
Rym: The messages about if you have a goal, how much are you willing to sacrifice for that goal?

738
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,240
Scott: The message, the obvious comparisons to society.

739
00:33:53,303 --> 00:33:53,470
Scott: Right.

740
00:33:53,900 --> 00:34:02,960
Scott: The, you know, my favorite episode, the one where they get all fancy and crazy rich by participating in the fights and then come falling right back down because it's horrible being rich.

741
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,640
Rym: That one being the most ham-fisted.

742
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:06,000
Scott: Yeah, but I like that episode.

743
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,799
Scott: Some of my favorite episodes.

744
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,675
Rym: Don't get me wrong.

745
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,498
Rym: I enjoy a big old fist ham.

746
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:14,540
Rym: The somewhat more disturbing elements about that.

747
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:22,159
Rym: This is a story about basically someone who was abused and raped by her mother repeatedly and put up with it in order to then murder her mother.

748
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,760
Scott: Well, a lot of whole talk about family in general.

749
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,678
Rym: We'll get into that bit.

750
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,280
Scott: You know, it's like, no, these crazy people are my real family.

751
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:29,853
Scott: Fuck you.

752
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:36,299
Rym: It had morals about not using violence and it had equally strong morals about sometimes violence is the only way.

753
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:37,757
Scott: Don't lose it.

754
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:38,300
Rym: Yes.

755
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,659
Rym: Don't lose your violent ways.

756
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,940
Scott: It makes her the best entertainment for violence.

757
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,437
Rym: I pretty much pegged that Satsuki was going to betray her mom and try to murder her.

758
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:49,399
Scott: A million episodes early.

759
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,300
Scott: I mean, but really that's, you know, like I was saying before, how the ending was sort of like, you know, sort of plateau.

760
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,079
Scott: That was the turn when they actually teamed up.

761
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:02,220
Scott: Like that was basically the beginning of the end and it plateaued from there.

762
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,499
Rym: However, that moment.

763
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,340
Scott: That was like the last crazy climactic thing to happen.

764
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,140
Scott: We have teamed up now.

765
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,459
Scott: We will now end the show for you.

766
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:17,940
Rym: When they fully teamed up and then you get that shot with Zenny and he goes all like Gundam dramatic as the ship sails off.

767
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:18,400
Rym: Yeah.

768
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,719
Rym: That was one of my favorite scenes in the whole show.

769
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:21,757
Scott: Money guy.

770
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,500
Rym: Yeah.

771
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,280
Rym: I love that guy.

772
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,360
Scott: Crazy distant side characters coming back and mattering.

773
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,540
Rym: Well, cause he got the watercolor flash at the end.

774
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,839
Rym: I love that watercolor flash.

775
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:36,897
Rym: That, that is a, that is the, the, that is the moment in old shows where you go, ah, shit, son.

776
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:39,284
Rym: How's it like that?

777
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:43,760
Rym: pictures that were made of him and then it's like on a laptop covered in pieces of paper that say Bitcoin.

778
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:47,760
Rym: That just makes me giggle.

779
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,160
Scott: That guy would definitely have all the Bitcoins in the real world.

780
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,900
Rym: But I really liked the characters and it's, it's mostly about characters.

781
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,720
Rym: It is, but the plot was straightforward, sensical, complex enough to be interesting, but you're right.

782
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:11,480
Rym: It did kind of plateau because after that moment, the final fight was literally just a series of escalations that ended in a conversation and a suicide.

783
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:11,950
Scott: Yep.

784
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,240
Scott: It was just like, all right, we have teamed up now.

785
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,739
Scott: We will now fight everything we have to fight until it's over.

786
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:23,620
Scott: And it was almost video game ish and like, you know, beating the mini bosses, being the final boss, being the second form of the final boss.

787
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,120
Rym: Right.

788
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,680
Rym: Marco coming back.

789
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,400
Scott: It's like the didn't, the plot didn't really twist or turn or evolve after that, you know, moment.

790
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,058
Scott: It was pretty much just, you know, let's, all right, we have, we have now resolved and now we will fight to the finish.

791
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:42,084
Rym: The show did a couple of those false pull at the heartstrings that a couple other shows have done.

792
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,177
Rym: that kind of annoyed me.

793
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:45,500
Rym: Like, Gamagori's dead.

794
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,279
Rym: Oh, no, he's not.

795
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:47,499
Rym: No, no, he's not.

796
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,378
Rym: We just did that.

797
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:48,840
Rym: Fuck.

798
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,399
Scott: I was actually disappointed that none, you know, they didn't really murder a whole bunch of good characters.

799
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:59,720
Rym: Uh, I, I kind of expected one more character who I liked to be killed.

800
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,880
Scott: I mean, they could have done, I was even expecting them to do something funny.

801
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:05,759
Scott: Like maybe guts gets killed and they have a little doggy funeral.

802
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,299
Rym: That would have been really sad.

803
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,457
Scott: Just something like that.

804
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:16,376
Rym: You know, I was actually kind of surprised by the manner of Senketsu death by the, by that point, I assumed he made it.

805
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:26,057
Scott: Well, I mean, I sort of assumed in advance that like, if they're going to kill all the life fibers, like Senketsu, Junketsu, right?

806
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,420
Scott: Those are all, you know, anything that was involving life fibers, right?

807
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,260
Scott: Including Ryuko, I figured was toast, right?

808
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,200
Rym: They might've been able to make it.

809
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,880
Rym: Senketsu might've made it if they just headed back a little earlier.

810
00:37:37,127 --> 00:37:37,215
Scott: Yeah.

811
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:47,199
Scott: I assumed, you know, when they were fighting the giant, you know, the one original life fiber, I'm like, oh, I guess the only things that will die at the end of the show for sure are things that have life fibers in them.

812
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:56,039
Scott: So all the, all the uniforms and all the people who are half life fiber and all the just life fiber monsters are all dead because good guys are going to win and we're going to make bad guys win.

813
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:56,213
Rym: Yup.

814
00:37:56,602 --> 00:37:56,731
Scott: Right.

815
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,638
Rym: And that would have been an interesting thing.

816
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,285
Scott: That was 99% correct.

817
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:10,240
Rym: Though I kind of, did you notice how all the shots of the outside, basically other than the area around this school, everyone's just totally normal lives.

818
00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:13,240
Rym: Like only that area was post-apocalyptic.

819
00:38:13,384 --> 00:38:13,736
Rym: Yeah.

820
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,459
Scott: It's very like, they would always show the map.

821
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,440
Scott: Like life fibers have taken over the whole world.

822
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,659
Scott: They've covered the whole world.

823
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,139
Rym: But then it's like some dude like, what's that up there in the sky?

824
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:23,999
Rym: I was having coffee.

825
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,400
Scott: Yeah.

826
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,460
Scott: Only these tiny area of Japan did anything actually matter in the whole world.

827
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,140
Scott: Right.

828
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,579
Scott: But it affected the whole world.

829
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:35,220
Rym: Aliens from space always land in Tokyo near this particular school.

830
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:42,439
Scott: This particular public school with like a few hundred students is where all the earth dominating space aliens will come to fight.

831
00:38:43,803 --> 00:38:45,139
Scott: They just know where the good guys are.

832
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,900
Scott: I mean, messenger Z, all the bad robots always come near where he launches from.

833
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:50,700
Scott: Right.

834
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:51,112
Rym: Yeah.

835
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:51,739
Rym: That is true.

836
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,460
Scott: It's not like, you know, the only thing that handles this properly.

837
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,318
Scott: Well, Ava kind of.

838
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,299
Rym: Ava handles it very well.

839
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,960
Rym: It lampshades us directly with, oh, they're actually trying to get into your bullshit.

840
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:01,560
Scott: That's true.

841
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:07,500
Scott: But I'm saying in terms of alien invaders are actually going everywhere on earth and you have to stop them everywhere on earth.

842
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,100
Scott: There's only one thing I can think of that.

843
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,624
Rym: That's the one.

844
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:10,329
Scott: that's the one.

845
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,419
Rym: You know what the moral of XCOM was?

846
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,379
Rym: The original XCOM.

847
00:39:14,805 --> 00:39:15,458
Scott: Earth is big.

848
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:19,040
Rym: The secondary moral was poor countries don't get defense.

849
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,780
Scott: That's right.

850
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:23,053
Rym: I had a base in Europe and I had a base in the US.

851
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:24,379
Rym: and fuck everybody else.

852
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,420
Scott: And if I get a third base, maybe China or Japan.

853
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,480
Scott: Yeah, that's done.

854
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:32,139
Rym: I don't think I ever, ever put a base in Africa.

855
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:32,920
Rym: Nope.

856
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:37,680
Rym: I hid one in Antarctica once just so I could launch interceptors from up there.

857
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:39,140
Scott: Well, you know, the old ones are down there.

858
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,658
Scott: You got to watch out.

859
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,019
Scott: Those are, I mean, seriously, you can't just let them set a base down there.

860
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:53,800
Rym: The show also had enough false notes as in there were themes that didn't end up going anywhere or they lead you in a direction like a red herring.

861
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,920
Rym: But then that wasn't the plot to where you couldn't predict the full details of the show.

862
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,740
Rym: Like you could say a Gundam seed, right?

863
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:03,819
Scott: It's like, oh, this nudist beach.

864
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,698
Scott: What's up with them?

865
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:05,860
Scott: Oh, what's up with?

866
00:40:06,183 --> 00:40:06,999
Scott: Oh, what's up with them?

867
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,979
Scott: And then you finally, you know, it takes like three or four things before you learn the full truth of nudist beach.

868
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,379
Rym: Like I had a gist that Satsuki was going to turn on her mom.

869
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:21,420
Rym: I wasn't sure that everyone else around her knew that was the plan.

870
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:21,860
Scott: Yeah.

871
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,319
Scott: And it's like you didn't know the whole truth of it.

872
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,740
Scott: Like, oh, the whole school was just to strengthen everyone up to fight the mom.

873
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,680
Rym: But specifically to strengthen them to be able to resist the control of life fiber.

874
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:39,260
Rym: so they could then use them Lena inverse style casting the spells of the ancient evil gods.

875
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:39,760
Scott: Yep.

876
00:40:40,702 --> 00:40:41,800
Rym: Like those details.

877
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,905
Scott: It's like you knew it's like.

878
00:40:43,086 --> 00:40:46,960
Scott: anyway, you could pretty easily predict and see where the show was going generally.

879
00:40:47,482 --> 00:40:50,955
Scott: But the details like that were, you know, not like.

880
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:57,720
Rym: I was obsessed the whole show with the fact that it was Senketsu life fiber synchronized junketsu life fiber override.

881
00:40:58,342 --> 00:41:01,660
Rym: And they did set it up that Matoi would talk to Senketsu.

882
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:02,520
Rym: They had a thing going.

883
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,400
Rym: Satsuki would just would just dominate junketsu.

884
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,399
Rym: And occasionally that didn't work out so well.

885
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:07,668
Rym: Yep.

886
00:41:08,401 --> 00:41:12,700
Rym: That's why I was so sure that that was going to be a thing and it ended up being a thing.

887
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:14,820
Rym: But it was not the thing I thought it would be.

888
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,440
Scott: And it was a thing that only mattered like a little bit for a while.

889
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:19,980
Scott: And then that plot was sort of wrapped up and done.

890
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:27,560
Rym: But I love when they show it like restrained Eva style in that case and they're messing with it and how they basically couldn't control it.

891
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,339
Rym: And they just put like Matoi's blood in there.

892
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,100
Scott: Yeah, I was for sure.

893
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:35,340
Scott: Like the first thing they give you in the show is it's like, don't go too crazy.

894
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:37,380
Scott: We'll just drink all your blood and you'll be dead.

895
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:37,629
Scott: Right.

896
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:39,439
Scott: And that was emphasized early on.

897
00:41:39,843 --> 00:41:41,520
Scott: And it comes up a little bit later on.

898
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,160
Scott: And I was so sure right from episode one or Mike.

899
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:52,660
Scott: Well, towards the end of the show, at some point, if not at the end, someone is just going to die from having all their blood sucked out by their life fiber uniform.

900
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:54,258
Scott: And it didn't happen.

901
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,320
Rym: See, I made a much more specific prediction.

902
00:41:56,581 --> 00:42:05,059
Rym: I thought that someone was going to die and their blood was going to fuel someone else's uniform to strike the final blow.

903
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,359
Rym: I thought either Ryuko or Satsuki was going to die and their blood was going to save the other one.

904
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,769
Rym: That's a very specific prediction.

905
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:20,439
Scott: that or at the very least, somebody's like, you know, uniform would like untransformed because they were out of blood and then they get killed right by by fighting.

906
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:27,500
Rym: Though also, you know, the fact that I did not expect Ryuko to be life fibers.

907
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,499
Scott: Yeah, no.

908
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,320
Rym: But then in retrospect, looking at the show again, yeah, she survived a lot of things that clearly killed other people.

909
00:42:35,022 --> 00:42:36,500
Scott: I mean, she was a badass, right?

910
00:42:36,881 --> 00:42:42,340
Scott: From the very beginning, she shows up and she's fighting without any special, any no uniform or anything.

911
00:42:42,742 --> 00:42:45,299
Scott: And it's just like, oh, she's just a really badass fighter.

912
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,591
Scott: Yeah.

913
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,280
Scott: Because she and they didn't explain to you how she got that.

914
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,220
Rym: But then they would show you like other people who are kind of badasses die.

915
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:53,127
Rym: Yeah.

916
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,079
Rym: Like what's his name?

917
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,839
Rym: We stole the uniform.

918
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,960
Rym: They just fucking killed him.

919
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,640
Scott: He wasn't a badass.

920
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,359
Scott: He was some high school punk.

921
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,620
Rym: Yeah, but he was still moderately badass because he could wear the Goku uniform.

922
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,619
Scott: With a one star.

923
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,120
Scott: Yeah.

924
00:43:05,023 --> 00:43:07,159
Scott: Everyone at the school was wearing one stars pretty much.

925
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,999
Rym: No, the vast majority of them were no stars.

926
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,679
Scott: The no stars didn't really make it.

927
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,939
Rym: How many people died in the no late day?

928
00:43:14,644 --> 00:43:15,460
Rym: That's my question.

929
00:43:17,063 --> 00:43:18,098
Rym: That's what I want to find out.

930
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,020
Scott: Yeah, it's a good question.

931
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,820
Scott: How many people died in the Osaka battle?

932
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:22,800
Rym: Oh, my God.

933
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,699
Scott: It's probably got the highest kill count at all.

934
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:28,667
Rym: But this show was that.

935
00:43:28,787 --> 00:43:39,519
Rym: that is my main point that this show did enough interesting things in a complex enough manner to where you couldn't just watch the opener and predict every beat of the show along to the end.

936
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:40,560
Rym: You could only predict.

937
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,731
Rym: But yet everything was self-consistent.

938
00:43:44,173 --> 00:43:45,780
Rym: going back and watching it again.

939
00:43:46,284 --> 00:43:48,120
Rym: All those things make perfect sense.

940
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,520
Rym: Nothing comes out of nowhere.

941
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,223
Scott: Yeah, there's nothing.

942
00:43:50,243 --> 00:43:52,979
Scott: there's nothing in the show where you're like, oh, giant given plot hole.

943
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,120
Scott: This show's garbage, poorly written, right?

944
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:59,796
Scott: And it's just, you know, the show just had all these aspects that make it really fun to watch.

945
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,137
Scott: It pumps you the fuck up.

946
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:01,531
Rym: Yep.

947
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,120
Rym: The leitmotifs of the characters that don't lose your way song.

948
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,460
Rym: Right.

949
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,600
Rym: That is like the music in the first level of Doom one.

950
00:44:09,082 --> 00:44:10,899
Rym: That's like the music in tribes, too.

951
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,920
Scott: There's a lot of bad animations, but also good animations.

952
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,019
Scott: Which they've corrected.

953
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:17,220
Scott: Yeah, the bad ones are getting fixed.

954
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:19,740
Scott: So if you watch it now, it's probably really good.

955
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,339
Rym: Though it's telling, it takes repeated watchings usually to notice the really bad animation mistakes.

956
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,360
Scott: Yeah, they rushed it out for TV South Park style and then they fixed it later.

957
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:27,750
Rym: Yep.

958
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:35,019
Scott: So, you know, there's plenty of good animations, plenty of references to the old animes to excite the nerds when they see them.

959
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,998
Rym: So many references.

960
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:37,058
Scott: All the references.

961
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:44,380
Rym: Like some of them were so like there was a point in one of the episodes where the those various people are sewing uniforms.

962
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,740
Rym: And it was, I want to go find the exact episode of Sailor Moon that this was ripping off.

963
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,820
Rym: Like to the point that I think the background was the same.

964
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:54,240
Scott: Right.

965
00:44:54,684 --> 00:44:55,919
Scott: It's got comedies.

966
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,459
Scott: It's got, you know.

967
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,740
Rym: And the comedy, you know what, was funny.

968
00:45:00,382 --> 00:45:03,180
Rym: Which is not super common in a lot of anime.

969
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,240
Rym: Like a lot of anime are funny, but I don't laugh out loud.

970
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,240
Rym: But I actually laughed out loud unexpectedly a couple of times in this show.

971
00:45:10,884 --> 00:45:12,960
Scott: It's got, you know, it's got pretty much everything.

972
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,460
Scott: It's got some highbrow.

973
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,378
Scott: It's got some lowbrow.

974
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,020
Scott: It's got some action scenes.

975
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,100
Scott: It's got some romance scenes.

976
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,820
Scott: It's got, you know, it's got animes for everything.

977
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:24,099
Scott: Every aspect of anime is in the show.

978
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,078
Rym: What is not in this show?

979
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,519
Scott: It does not.

980
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,539
Scott: Actual porn.

981
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:30,459
Scott: It gets close.

982
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:30,780
Rym: Yep.

983
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,879
Rym: So there's no actual porn.

984
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:38,460
Rym: And even then to be to be significantly titillated by the show, you've got to be the kind of person.

985
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:40,500
Scott: It's like people are getting naked left and right.

986
00:45:40,982 --> 00:45:42,859
Scott: And they're doing sexy things left and right.

987
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:47,100
Scott: But if it actually turns you on to watch the show, that's weird, dude.

988
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,119
Rym: Well, other than what about the little romance scenes?

989
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,919
Rym: Like from Mako's like, oh, I like her.

990
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,880
Scott: But you're getting actually turned on by that for reals.

991
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:54,516
Scott: Like, oh, baby.

992
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,179
Rym: Well, turned on is not a switch.

993
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,019
Rym: It's not binary.

994
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,954
Rym: It's not like you were either 100% turned on or not.

995
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,180
Scott: You're not faffing to that, right?

996
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,076
Rym: Someone is.

997
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,580
Scott: That's a bad dude.

998
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:04,580
Rym: Someone's faffing everything.

999
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:04,859
Scott: You know what?

1000
00:46:04,941 --> 00:46:05,398
Scott: It's a dude.

1001
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,497
Rym: I'm not even gonna lie.

1002
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,259
Rym: I don't know.

1003
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:14,298
Rym: The show does have elements of sexual tension that I could see driving a certain kind of person in a certain way.

1004
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,880
Scott: But I don't think they're faffing to the show directly.

1005
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:25,499
Rym: Like we said in one of our panels at Anime Boston, you can tell a lot about your friend by how they recommend Kill La Kill to you.

1006
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:31,840
Rym: If they talk about the fact that it involves nakedness, they're probably a bad person.

1007
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:38,359
Rym: If they talk about how over the top and awesome it is, and they mentioned going a guy, they're probably an awesome person.

1008
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:40,980
Scott: You should still watch it anyway, right?

1009
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,258
Scott: Just watch it for the right reasons.

1010
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,197
Scott: Why would you not watch this?

1011
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,900
Scott: What else are you possibly watching?

1012
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,860
Rym: The thing is, this show is going to be important for anime.

1013
00:46:51,485 --> 00:46:52,559
Rym: I honestly believe that.

1014
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,020
Scott: This will not be a show that, like, I can already feel Attack on Titan sort of disappearing.

1015
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,680
Rym: Well duh, because Attack on Titan is just Full Metal Alchemist 2 Electric Boogaloo.

1016
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,238
Scott: I think when they make more anime of Attack on Titan, if they do, they probably will, right?

1017
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:08,339
Scott: Then it'll come, it'll rise again.

1018
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,079
Scott: Oh, it'll explode.

1019
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,260
Scott: Much like Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood made it rise again.

1020
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,539
Rym: Yeah, but then it'll fall again.

1021
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,420
Scott: Kill La Kill, there's not gonna be any more Kill La Kill ever.

1022
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:18,000
Scott: But, oh, isn't there gonna be like one OAV or something?

1023
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,659
Rym: Supposedly there's going to be an OAV.

1024
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,900
Scott: There's not gonna be any significant Kill La Kill ever again, right?

1025
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,680
Rym: Which is, because they could very easily make a sequel.

1026
00:47:26,841 --> 00:47:27,719
Rym: Sure, if they wanted to.

1027
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,919
Scott: I don't know what it'd be about, but they could.

1028
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,340
Rym: Yeah, just like Cowboy Bebop, I mean.

1029
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,560
Scott: More shows, same characters.

1030
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,620
Rym: Cowgirl at 9.

1031
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,179
Rym: I would watch, if they've had a hundred more episodes of just these characters, I would probably watch it.

1032
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,019
Rym: But at the same time, I don't want them to do that.

1033
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,311
Scott: Kill La Kill Fumafu, right?

1034
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,959
Scott: But this show, I don't think, you know, it still hasn't been a long time, so I don't know for sure.

1035
00:47:47,362 --> 00:47:49,680
Scott: But I would bet it will not disappear completely.

1036
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,078
Scott: Many moons from now, it will still be mentioned and remembered and talked about.

1037
00:47:54,803 --> 00:47:55,160
Rym: Exactly.

1038
00:47:55,941 --> 00:48:05,640
Scott: I don't know if it'll be on the, you know, the A level with the Evangelion changing all anime history, but it'll be, you know, a step or two under that.

1039
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:12,640
Rym: It's very rare that I'll say something like that about an anime within the first decade of it having been in existence.

1040
00:48:14,907 --> 00:48:15,500
Rym: So, yeah.

1041
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,599
Rym: And yeah, if you're mad right now about us talking about your precious Attack on Titan, seriously, I like Attack on Titan a lot.

1042
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,260
Rym: It's Full Metal Alchemist.

1043
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,577
Rym: It's time will pass.

1044
00:48:26,682 --> 00:48:31,120
Rym: In fact, it's time is actually passing pretty rapidly unless they get an OAV or something out stat.

1045
00:48:32,185 --> 00:48:33,420
Rym: Though the cosplay is rising.

1046
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:41,620
Rym: I saw way more like Kill la Kill busted onto the cosplay scene in a huge way for obvious reasons.

1047
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,978
Rym: I mean, it's a show about clothes.

1048
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:44,420
Scott: It's a show about clothes.

1049
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,500
Scott: It was made for cosplay.

1050
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,900
Rym: I mean, the second opener just has all those, like all their costumes cycling.

1051
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,799
Scott: And then whenever they introduce a new costume, they change the opener to add that new costume to the rotation.

1052
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:55,335
Rym: Yep.

1053
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,079
Rym: Actually, too, look at the second opener thinking back on it.

1054
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:02,100
Rym: It does the Gundam seed thing.

1055
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:03,220
Rym: It tells you what's going to happen.

1056
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:12,240
Rym: You notice how you see Matoi and her people on one ramp, one lane, and then on the other lane of that fashion stage, you see Satsuki and her people.

1057
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,180
Rym: They both have their group of crazy people.

1058
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:21,420
Rym: They get to the same goal through different means, looking at each other the whole time, walking along the way, and then cut each other up with swords.

1059
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,300
Rym: Well, fight with each other, but spray blood all over the place.

1060
00:49:25,042 --> 00:49:27,760
Rym: Then after they fight, it does the same thing in Gundam.

1061
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:42,297
Rym: Remember in Gundam seed, there was a point where two characters slide in from the side with guns pointed at each other, and then when the opener updates mid-season, they slide in from the side, they keep going, same poses, now they're back to back, and that's the episode where they join up.

1062
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,580
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1063
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:55,700
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1064
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:01,100
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1065
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,040
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1066
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:08,780
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
