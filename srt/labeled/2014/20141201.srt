1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,647
Rym: It's Monday, December 1st, 2014.

2
00:00:09,647 --> 00:00:09,848
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:13,119
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,880
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,999
Rym: Buying computers for other people.

6
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:21,219
Rym: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,219
Scott: So in New York, we know it's a lot better idea to have a company manage your rent and building than have a person.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:33,636
Rym: Yes.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,540
Scott: Like some landlord.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,280
Rym: I really like the fact that my landlord is a faceless and uncaring entity.

11
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,518
Scott: So my company was pretty good.

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,838
Scott: But sometime earlier this year, what happened was they would send me an envelope every month to send my rent in.

13
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:52,520
Scott: And one month I didn't get the envelope, so I couldn't send my rent.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,440
Scott: I had to figure out how to send it some other way.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,340
Rym: I love how despite being the greatest city in the world, you basically can't pay your rent except with checks.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,498
Scott: Yeah, so I called them and I was like, "Hey, can we work on some kind of auto

17
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:02,600
Scott: pay?".

18
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:08,776
Scott: But it resulted in I paid a rent late because I couldn't send it on time because they fucked up.

19
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:13,060
Scott: But they refused to waive the late fee, so I basically lost 70 bucks because they fucked up.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,258
Scott: And I'm like, "Well, fuck, it's not worth

21
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:15,459
Scott: it.".

22
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:16,187
Rym: Wow, 70?

23
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:17,920
Rym: My late fee is $15.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,939
Scott: Right, so yeah, fuck those guys.

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,140
Scott: But anyway, after that, I was paying on time.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,220
Scott: Everything went back to normal.

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,979
Scott: But fuck them, I want my 70 bucks back.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,720
Rym: Still in small claims court.

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,371
Scott: Well, I switched and I went to my bank and I said, "Hey, bank, can you just mail them a check every

30
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:30,596
Scott: month?".

31
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:32,000
Rym: I tried that once.

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,537
Rym: You know what?

33
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:35,559
Rym: That's why our landlord in Beacon was so pissed off at us all the time.

34
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,239
Rym: Because it never fucking worked.

35
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:39,558
Scott: This actually worked when I did it.

36
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:41,120
Scott: But there was a problem.

37
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:45,420
Scott: You see, in August, the payment went out in late August for the September rent.

38
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:45,838
Rym: Yep.

39
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:47,340
Scott: And it went out as normal.

40
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:49,080
Scott: And up until then, it had been working fine.

41
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:50,020
Scott: And it did work fine.

42
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:52,460
Scott: I can see in my thing that the check made it and cleared.

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,318
Rym: So they cashed it?

44
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:53,759
Rym: Yes.

45
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,360
Rym: Now they say they didn't cash it, right?

46
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,080
Scott: Two days after that, that check was sent by my bank.

47
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:03,260
Scott: I got a letter under the door that was like, "Management company's changing.

48
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,792
Scott: Send rents to this new

49
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:05,176
Scott: place.".

50
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:11,779
Scott: The new place apparently did not hear word of that rent, even though it was cashed.

51
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:22,499
Scott: But the new place is actually, even though they fucked up the laundry room, you can just go to their website and pay online and go to their website and complain and go to their website and whatever you need to do.

52
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:26,139
Scott: Even though it's sort of an old, cruddy, bad restaurant website, it works.

53
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:29,760
Rym: Wow, that's actually more than I have in my laundry building here.

54
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,578
Scott: I actually used that website to be like, "Hey, my fire alarm needs some

55
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:34,799
Scott: help.".

56
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,399
Scott: They came and fixed it right a fucking way.

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:36,800
Scott: Wow.

58
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:37,519
Scott: It was amazing.

59
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:37,830
Scott: Nice.

60
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:39,899
Rym: Wait, how'd they fuck up your laundry room?

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,629
Scott: They switched the machines out to a different company to manage the machines.

62
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:48,559
Scott: that charges more money and makes you use a really annoying smart card system instead of quarters.

63
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,080
Rym: I would kill for a smart card system no matter how annoying.

64
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,780
Scott: But now it's 75 cents more per washing machine.

65
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,318
Rym: What do you pay?

66
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,780
Rym: For me, it's $3.25 for the gigantic fucking... I can literally put every towel I own in there.

67
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,161
Scott: I was paying $1.25, now I'm paying $2.

68
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:05,149
Rym: Oh, it's $1.25 for our tank?

69
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:09,936
Scott: It's now cheaper for me to just go to the laundry lady and have her do everything for me.

70
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:11,471
Scott: Except for laundry.

71
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,099
Scott: I don't want to give them.

72
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:19,479
Scott: Anyway, so the machine is... The payment, the smart card is just annoying the way it works.

73
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,500
Scott: It's even worse than RIT flex money or whatever.

74
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,698
Scott: Anyway.

75
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:24,620
Rym: I remember RIT flex money.

76
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,979
Scott: Yeah, so the company is mostly good, as usual, as expected from a company.

77
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,139
Scott: But they seem to have fucked up.

78
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:38,438
Scott: Even though every single month I have made one rent payment every single month, this month they're like, "You owe twice as

79
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:38,680
Scott: much.".

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,054
Scott: And I'm like, "What the fuck are you talking

81
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:40,377
Scott: about?".

82
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:45,740
Scott: If I pay twice as much, I expect to not pay again until late January for February's rent.

83
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,553
Scott: And they're like, "Here's a record of all the payments you have sent

84
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:48,717
Scott: us.".

85
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:52,820
Scott: And I have sent them, the new company so far, three payments.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,020
Scott: I sent them a payment in September for October.

87
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:57,079
Scott: A payment in October for November.

88
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:02,040
Scott: And... No, I said... September, October, November.

89
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,080
Rym: November for December?

90
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:05,359
Scott: Yes.

91
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,920
Scott: I sent a payment in November for December.

92
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,657
Scott: Fascinating.

93
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,798
Scott: I'm trying to send the payment in November for December, you see, right?

94
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:16,985
Scott: Yup.

95
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:25,700
Scott: But they have accounted it such to where that payment that I sent in August to the old company, right, they do not have record of that.

96
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:29,540
Scott: And they thought that that was an August payment.

97
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:34,370
Scott: So the payment that I sent them in September for October, they considered to be...

98
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,220
Rym: So my only question to you is, has this resulted in a phone conversation with a human yet?

99
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,800
Scott: No, I'm just emailing them instead.

100
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,139
Scott: You can choose on their website how you want to talk.

101
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,560
Rym: Alright, emailing's better.

102
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,559
Scott: So I chose email, so I have documentation.

103
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,447
Scott: But it's just like, I just sent the email that was like, "Uh, here...".

104
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,498
Scott: I think yesterday I sent the email that was like, "Uh, why is my rent

105
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:56,640
Scott: double?".

106
00:04:57,382 --> 00:05:01,290
Scott: And then just now I sent the letter that was like, "I think you fucked up.

107
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:02,600
Scott: Why is everything...".

108
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:09,899
Rym: It's funny that you have this problem, because just now our rent for December came, the little slip.

109
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,300
Rym: So I'm like, alright, I guess it's my turn, so I'll pay it, because I'm the one I kind of semi-alternate on who pays it, just whatever.

110
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:27,060
Rym: And I open it up, and I owed like over $6,000, because they didn't... They said that I owed this next month, December, and I'm late on October.

111
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:27,936
Scott: Uh-huh.

112
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,420
Rym: November, November.

113
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:30,979
Rym: God, we're bad with months.

114
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,877
Rym: I think we're getting old.

115
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:37,400
Rym: So Emily's like, "I paid it, and sure enough, we have a photo of the check.

116
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,468
Rym: Like, we mailed it.

117
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:39,719
Rym: They didn't cash

118
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:39,780
Rym: it.".

119
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:49,480
Rym: So the trouble is, the last time that happened to me, like years ago, I remember like calling these people multiple times and being like, "You didn't get the check.

120
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:50,580
Rym: You didn't get the check.

121
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,300
Rym: Do not cash the check.

122
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,056
Rym: If you get it, I'm going to send you another

123
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:54,358
Rym: one.".

124
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:56,640
Rym: And of course, I mailed them another check.

125
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,116
Rym: They then immediately, like within hours, cashed the check.

126
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,402
Scott: Right.

127
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:04,680
Scott: There's a person whose job it is, basically just open checks and stamp them and put them in.

128
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,558
Scott: They don't think about them or care or have any like little list of like, "If you see this check, don't use

129
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:09,639
Scott: it.".

130
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:14,799
Rym: Yeah, the problem is, one, it cost me a lot of money to cancel a check, and two, I learned something.

131
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,978
Rym: Cancelled checks are only cancelled for up to at most a year.

132
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:21,260
Rym: So they're not actually cancelled forever.

133
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,940
Scott: So if someone gives me a check, and they cancel it on me.

134
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,300
Rym: Eventually, the cancel expires unless they paid or renew it with most banks.

135
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:29,980
Scott: So you write me a check.

136
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:30,800
Scott: I go to the bank.

137
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,960
Scott: The bank's like, "We ain't doing this.

138
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,205
Scott: It got

139
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:32,639
Scott: cancelled.".

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Scott: They give me the check back.

141
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,537
Rym: Wait a few years.

142
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:35,760
Rym: Yeah, they give the check back usually.

143
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:38,879
Scott: And then I wait a few years, then go use it again.

144
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,327
Scott: Yeah.

145
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:40,420
Scott: And then it'll work.

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,078
Rym: That is what my bank told me when I asked them about this.

147
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:45,259
Scott: All right.

148
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,419
Rym: And I was like, "Yeah, I'm not going to cancel the check.

149
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,638
Rym: I'll just sue my landlord and small claims court if it comes to it.

150
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:52,334
Rym: That will be

151
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:52,560
Rym: easier.".

152
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:54,579
Scott: So I wonder what's going to happen here.

153
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,360
Scott: I want to try to resolve it with this company as much as possible and not have to resort to other measures.

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:06:59,896
Rym: Yeah.

155
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:01,460
Rym: The thing is, I've been itching.

156
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,019
Rym: I kind of want to go to small claims court.

157
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:09,680
Rym: But every time I've threatened someone with that, the situation has resolved amicably among adults.

158
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:22,080
Rym: So I guess I need to get into a conflict with someone where I not only have documentation that I'm correct and that they owe me verifiable damages, but where that person is not an adult.

159
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:24,819
Rym: But also not a minor by age.

160
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,460
Rym: They need to be above 18, yet not actually act like an adult.

161
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:32,099
Rym: And somehow have gotten into a situation where they owe me money.

162
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,459
Rym: I don't think that is likely to ever happen to me in my life.

163
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:38,500
Rym: So I got a bunch of news here.

164
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:39,060
Rym: It's Monday.

165
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,500
Rym: We're finally back from Thanksgiving.

166
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:44,120
Rym: I had way too much food and still reeling from the consequences.

167
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,360
Scott: I still have extra food.

168
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,358
Rym: I have extra farts.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,090
Scott: Okay.

170
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,118
Scott: I have lots of farts too.

171
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,758
Rym: Yeah, I have a surplus of farts if anyone would like to borrow some.

172
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:53,760
Rym: We also had multiple Thanksgivings.

173
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,940
Scott: You should play the South Park game.

174
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,856
Scott: A lot of farting going on.

175
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,980
Rym: So there's a story here about, you know, it's politics, but Scott and I, and you at least should be, are mad about gerrymandering.

176
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:07,960
Rym: Or gerrymandering if you know how that guy's name was pronounced.

177
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,340
Scott: Yeah, how's your animated gif going over there?

178
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,600
Rym: Yeah, but it is Eldridge Gary.

179
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:22,720
Rym: So anyway, we're mad about it and a bunch of scientists, a bunch of mathematicians, decided to try to apply technological solutions to this.

180
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,520
Rym: They started studying gerrymandering and studying.

181
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,440
Scott: We should study to see if the gerrymandering they do is even optimal.

182
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,558
Scott: Like if you wanted to be evil, could you be even more evil than they are now?

183
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:40,240
Rym: So they basically proved that gerrymandering as it is done now does not just wash out and evenly corrupt.

184
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,720
Rym: It's actually really biased toward Republicans.

185
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,380
Rym: And two, it kind of shows.

186
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,199
Scott: So why don't Democrats undo it?

187
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:53,739
Rym: They can't because Republicans control the state legislatures that make these decisions.

188
00:08:54,782 --> 00:09:08,560
Rym: So basically the Republicans got control right before the Census in 2010 and as a result they'll basically have control until the demographics are so skewed Democrat that even maximum gerrymandering can't get them in office anymore.

189
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:13,860
Rym: I'm going to quote something from this, but basically they tried different simulations and models.

190
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:23,300
Rym: Like they do a thing where run every possible combination of district lines and figure out the most crazy things you could do based on the actual votes.

191
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,417
Rym: Like that kind of stuff.

192
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:27,740
Rym: "The results were startling.

193
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:39,960
Rym: After rerunning the election a hundred times with a randomly drawn nonpartisan map each time, the average simulated election result was seven or eight House seats for the Democrats and five or six for the Republicans.

194
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:45,220
Rym: The maximum number of Republican seats that emerged from any of the simulations was eight.

195
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:53,840
Rym: The actual outcome of that election was four Democrats and nine Republicans, which is statistically impossible.

196
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:55,794
Rym: It's not likely to

197
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:56,116
Rym: occur.".

198
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,840
Scott: So they're really, really good at gerrymandering.

199
00:09:59,241 --> 00:09:59,680
Rym: Exactly.

200
00:10:00,581 --> 00:10:01,179
Scott: That's surprising.

201
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,979
Scott: I thought they would find that they weren't good at gerrymandering and could have done an even more corrupt job.

202
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,560
Rym: No, they're amazing at gerrymandering.

203
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,836
Scott: Who is doing this gerrymandering?

204
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,179
Scott: It's like the representative is sitting there drawing maps.

205
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:12,502
Scott: Well,

206
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:32,140
Rym: actually it turns out they do just drag and draw it manually because it's really easy to figure it out because basically people who tend to vote Democrat or third parties that aren't Libertarians, like Green Party, they live in tightly packed urban districts and everybody else is spread out among thinly packed conservative districts.

207
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:35,700
Rym: So it's actually really easy to gerrymander.

208
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:41,820
Rym: But it has to be active because if it's random, it doesn't occur, even in extensive simulation.

209
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:57,240
Rym: The reason I bring this up is one, it's easy to be mad about political things, but if you want to be really mad about politics, we need verifiable, scientific, objective, quantifiable politics.

210
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,140
Scott: Well, at least if it's a democracy.

211
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:02,099
Scott: Only a democracy has math.

212
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,540
Rym: It's kind of like what Lawrence Lessig's trying to do with that secretary.

213
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,719
Scott: Other types of government do not have math.

214
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,740
Scott: A king doesn't use the numbers.

215
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,640
Scott: The only number a king needs is one.

216
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:13,689
Scott: I'm the king.

217
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:14,659
Scott: Deal with it.

218
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,439
Rym: Well, the Soviets had to count how many boots they said they made.

219
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,620
Scott: That's economics, not politics.

220
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,400
Rym: The politics, they would say how many boots they made, thus pushing the politics forward.

221
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,240
Scott: Sure, but democracy is not capitalism.

222
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,840
Rym: But look at Lawrence Lessig's thing.

223
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:40,099
Rym: The Super PAC failed to achieve a lot of the results it wanted in the election, but they gathered empirical data and are going to attempt to use that data to come up with models of how to effectively intervene.

224
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:40,822
Scott: Move.

225
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:45,119
Scott: Everyone move, and they can't move the district faster than we can move our butts.

226
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,240
Rym: Should we move to a red state district in the middle of nowhere and vote Democrat?

227
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,279
Scott: Are a thousand other nerds moving with us?

228
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:53,186
Rym: Yeah.

229
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:54,559
Rym: Is there internet out there?

230
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,940
Scott: Will we be able to bring enough nerds to set up internet out there?

231
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:01,700
Rym: I think the chicken egg problem is pretty decidedly on.

232
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,300
Rym: Nerds won't go where there's not internet.

233
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,940
Scott: Google, build an office there or some shit.

234
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:25,280
Rym: So, the moral of this, everyone should read this, because regardless of your political affiliation, though if you're conservative, you're wrong, but regardless of your political affiliation, this is empirical evidence of straight-up objective corruption that is trivially fixed by the minimal application of technology.

235
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:26,926
Scott: Soccer?

236
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:27,580
Scott: Same thing?

237
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,378
Rym: Yeah, same thing.

238
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:42,460
Scott: I actually saw a soccer game this weekend, or at least a part of one, and the ref actually had a little wristwatch thing that told him when the ball went in the goal, and he used it, and he got a call right that he probably would have gotten wrong otherwise.

239
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,125
Rym: Scandal.

240
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,120
Rym: It's ruined football.

241
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:44,955
Scott: I know.

242
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,454
Rym: So, in other news, you know we talk a lot, you and me, about how as much as the U.S.

243
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:55,800
Rym: is bad about things, it's the least bad country in the world at regulating the internet.

244
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,939
Scott: It's not the least bad, but in terms of regulating internet, you can do a lot worse.

245
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:03,479
Rym: ICANN, ARPA level.

246
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,620
Rym: Regulating, like, interchanges.

247
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,499
Scott: Most of the countries on Earth, not all, but most, are worse than us in terms of internet censoring and such.

248
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Rym: So the EU has once again proven why we can't let Europe have any control specifically.

249
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:18,699
Rym: With their anti-free speech.

250
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,220
Scott: Well, we already knew about their right to be forgotten, which is not a right.

251
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:23,112
Scott: Which they're making worse.

252
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,140
Rym: They're still fighting that.

253
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,600
Rym: When I have another news I'm not talking about.

254
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,700
Scott: Google should just give them the finger and be like, "Fuck you.

255
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:31,820
Scott: If you ask for the right to be forgotten, we'll increase your search rank.

256
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:32,325
Scott: Fuck you.

257
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,980
Scott: We don't have to do what you say.

258
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,100
Scott: Oh, you want to enforce it and make us enforce it in Europe only?

259
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:38,207
Scott: No Google for Europe.

260
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:39,216
Scott: Google's blocked in Europe.

261
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:39,559
Scott: Good luck.

262
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,426
Rym: Go fuck

263
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:40,816
Rym: yourselves.".

264
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,478
Rym: The European Parliament, the EU, That's what they should do.

265
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,678
Rym: has voted in favor of forcing Google to be broken up.

266
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:51,441
Rym: As a solution to complaints that it favors-- To what?

267
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:54,520
Scott: A search company and a bunch of crappy worthless companies?

268
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:56,840
Rym: Yeah, I read the resolution.

269
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,520
Rym: They don't fucking know what they're talking about.

270
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,917
Scott: But it's not like Microsoft where you can be like, "Okay, we'll break apart the Xbox division, and we'll break apart the Office division and the Windows

271
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:06,379
Scott: division.".

272
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:08,088
Scott: It's Google.

273
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,300
Scott: All that makes fucking money for Google is search.

274
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,000
Scott: All the other things at Google are minuscule tiny garbage companies.

275
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,927
Rym: If you were going to break it up, I guess you could do-- Oh, no.

276
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:21,360
Scott: You could break Android off of Google, but Android doesn't really make any fucking money.

277
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:22,727
Rym: You could break YouTube out.

278
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:26,080
Rym: You could break Google search apps, all that stuff out separately.

279
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:28,080
Scott: YouTube can be a standalone company.

280
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,037
Rym: Those are three things.

281
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:31,779
Rym: And then advertising as a fourth thing.

282
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,940
Scott: But advertising and search are the same thing.

283
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,019
Rym: No, because if you say that, then YouTube and advertising are also the same thing.

284
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,322
Scott: They are.

285
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:40,580
Scott: The advertising is actually the only thing that makes money.

286
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,553
Rym: Yeah, but look at how they broke up the Ma Bell back in the day.

287
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:45,760
Scott: By geography.

288
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,700
Rym: Not just by geography, but also by business units.

289
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:57,699
Rym: So you'd basically have all these broken up pieces of companies doing business with each other just as separate companies instead of as divisions of the same company.

290
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,819
Scott: Oh, so the Google search company will just have an AdSense account like you and me.

291
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,359
Scott: Basically.

292
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,179
Scott: Yeah, great.

293
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:02,857
Rym: It's stupid.

294
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:11,040
Rym: Luckily, even they realize that they have no power to enforce a breakup yet, but they're very happy with the vote.

295
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,179
Scott: And basically, the EU, the European Parliament-- Google, just stop serving anything to Europe.

296
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,300
Rym: Individual European countries in general have been repeatedly going after Google as a monopoly.

297
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,155
Scott: Because it's a U.S.

298
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:24,460
Scott: company.

299
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,809
Scott: If it was a European company, they'd be like,

300
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:26,414
Scott: "Weeee!".

301
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:28,487
Scott: They just don't like that.

302
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:28,990
Scott: some U.S.

303
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,680
Scott: company has such power over Europe.

304
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:33,020
Scott: They're all European and proud.

305
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:36,661
Rym: Back in the old days of Slashdot-- In the

306
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:37,066
Rym: U.S.,

307
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:38,139
Rym: the same shit happened too.

308
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,952
Scott: Like, "Don't buy them Japanese

309
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:40,657
Scott: cars.".

310
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:45,580
Rym: In the old days, remember when Microsoft-- Nerds would be like, "Oh, Microsoft is a horrible monopoly.

311
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,271
Rym: They should be broken

312
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:46,413
Rym: up.".

313
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,040
Rym: Europe tried to break it up.

314
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,338
Scott: They were for like two minutes.

315
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:50,100
Rym: Yeah.

316
00:15:51,161 --> 00:16:00,460
Rym: So, the only results of that were that web browsers, which were an integral part of operating systems in the modern era, had to be temporarily separated.

317
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,620
Rym: And it was kind of just a stupid disaster that didn't actually achieve anything.

318
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,700
Scott: Yeah, I mean, tech companies are often monopolies, right?

319
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,453
Scott: Google does have a search monopoly now.

320
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:11,260
Scott: There's no question.

321
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,060
Rym: What Bing exists.

322
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:12,872
Scott: Yeah, OK.

323
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,460
Scott: Apple sort of has some kind of monopoly-ish, or at least a duopoly.

324
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,000
Rym: It has a much larger market share and is growing faster at the expense of Apple.

325
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,868
Scott: That sucks.

326
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:23,860
Scott: It's some kind of duopoly.

327
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,104
Scott: Anyway, there's plenty of-- What-opoly?

328
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:28,820
Rym: They're the minority in every market.

329
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,320
Scott: Right, but those kinds of things-- Except, I guess, pads.

330
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:44,319
Scott: A company that has superior technology, right, can dominate an entire industry quite easily, as Windows has in the past, as Intel basically is, sort of, right?

331
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:47,160
Scott: And then they can wield power because of this.

332
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:48,540
Scott: Amazon can do this, right?

333
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:56,980
Scott: However, a technology company is easily thwarted by superior technology, which comes along from smaller companies.

334
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,520
Scott: That's the thing about technology.

335
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:03,640
Scott: A tiny company like Google, coming out of nowhere, was able to beat all these other search engines.

336
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:07,138
Scott: You could come out of nowhere and beat Facebook, right?

337
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,079
Scott: Facebook came out of nowhere and beat Myspace, which was unthinkable.

338
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,680
Rym: AOL is dead.

339
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:12,719
Rym: In Europe, at least.

340
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,858
Rym: Like, in the US, a scary number of people use Bing and use other search engines and stuff.

341
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:35,620
Scott: Sure, you don't need to use antitrust to bust up technology companies, at least software companies specifically, because that's cheap to make, unless they're in power for an incredibly long period of time and no one has any chance of unseating them and they're wielding their power in unfair ways.

342
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,720
Rym: Well, that's the thing.

343
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,870
Scott: You need to use your antitrust to bust up, say, Verizon.

344
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:54,860
Rym: So, Google has over 90% of the search market in Europe, which is their main concern, and a lot of local people in Europe specifically complain about Google's search results as being unfair or unfairly favoring...

345
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,080
Scott: Someone's always going to complain.

346
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,040
Scott: Whoever's not first will always complain.

347
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:10,319
Rym: I think search engine results should have basically the equivalent of common carrier protections, in that if you have an algorithm and the algorithm shows whatever search results, that's totally fine.

348
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:14,700
Scott: The real core of the problem is that the algorithm is secret, right?

349
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:21,520
Scott: And if it wasn't secret, people could game it, but while it is secret, you can't prove that it isn't rigged.

350
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:23,780
Rym: But who says you can't rig it?

351
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,498
Rym: Who says it should be illegal to rig it?

352
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,720
Rym: There's a first principle there.

353
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,860
Rym: What does rigging entail?

354
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,440
Scott: Because then it becomes... The phone book is an alphabetical order, right?

355
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,659
Scott: So is the yellow pages.

356
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,760
Scott: The yellow pages, you increase how much space you get by paying more money.

357
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:41,920
Rym: It would not be illegal to put a phone book in order by who paid the most.

358
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:43,319
Scott: No, it wouldn't be.

359
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:45,279
Scott: The yellow pages is exactly that.

360
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,420
Scott: But it is a transparent system.

361
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,920
Scott: You can't say you gave that guy preferential treatment and made his shit bigger for less money.

362
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,880
Rym: It's not illegal to give someone preferential treatment for less money.

363
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:57,060
Scott: It is if you're a common carrier.

364
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,560
Scott: You're supposed to treat everyone equally.

365
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:11,940
Scott: So if the search engine results are supposed to be treating everyone equally using the same algorithm, but you're just secretly arbitrarily making your own links way higher rank, that's not really fair.

366
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:13,859
Scott: Especially if it's your other businesses.

367
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:18,400
Scott: The thing about a monopoly that's illegal is using your monopoly power to help other shit out.

368
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,640
Scott: That's why Microsoft got in trouble.

369
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,658
Scott: They used their Windows monopoly to boost IE.

370
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,020
Rym: It's not just helping.

371
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:25,320
Rym: It's a little more narrow than that.

372
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,740
Rym: They have to provide a specifically unfair competitive advantage.

373
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:37,800
Scott: Right, so if Google ranks all YouTube results way high and down ranks other video sites results like Vimeo, that's an unfair advantage to YouTube.

374
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:42,000
Scott: if the Vimeo video is actually better for the same search query.

375
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,956
Scott: You can't prove that they're not because the algorithm is a secret.

376
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,640
Rym: Well except Scott, search for videos on Google video search and search for videos on YouTube.

377
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,960
Rym: There's a reason why no one uses Google's video search because the results are not nearly as good as the YouTube results.

378
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,259
Scott: No, yeah, but I'm saying if you do a search period just in regular Google, sometimes videos are results.

379
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,396
Rym: Right?

380
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,713
Scott: So what if there's a Vimeo video?

381
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,560
Scott: that's a better result and it's getting down ranked?

382
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,495
Scott: You wouldn't even know.

383
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:15,160
Scott: So even if Google is not doing that, they're not proving they're not doing that.

384
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,878
Rym: I don't think there's a moral problem there because I just don't care.

385
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:22,960
Scott: But people didn't care about Microsoft busting up IE.

386
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,020
Scott: I don't think there's a moral problem.

387
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,680
Rym: Actually a lot of people cared a lot about that very weirdly.

388
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,699
Scott: There's a legal problem there.

389
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,199
Rym: And actually I thought that busting the IE thing up was actually the worst possible way to go about that.

390
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:37,700
Rym: I think that was a mistake.

391
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,760
Scott: I think it was a mistake because the web browser was a free product.

392
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,839
Scott: It wasn't even a business.

393
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,620
Scott: But the video is a business.

394
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:58,100
Rym: Yeah, but at the same time, I feel like with technology like search results, really the only way anyone should ever evaluate search results is by whether or not it achieves their personal goal.

395
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,739
Rym: And frankly, if someone doesn't care that the search results are skewed, I don't care either.

396
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:08,534
Scott: But even if you don't care that they are, it could even be on the level of racket.

397
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:15,180
Scott: To where Google's basically like, "You want to go to search results all day?

398
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,393
Scott: Better pay protection

399
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:16,677
Scott: fees.".

400
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:18,879
Rym: Except they don't have any business that lets you do that.

401
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,200
Scott: They don't, but for all you know, they could be doing that.

402
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:29,440
Scott: They could have partners, not like a web business that's on their site, but they could give preferential treatment to their partners and you wouldn't even know.

403
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:39,640
Rym: That activity, one, even if it were illegal, which arguably it probably actually isn't, could probably even still be caught through normal means without actually going after the search engine itself.

404
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,212
Scott: Sure, but we don't know.

405
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,720
Scott: That's what I'm saying.

406
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:52,780
Scott: Because the algorithm is completely secret to anyone in the public, you basically, if you have a low rank, you assume because you're a conspiracy theory-minded nut that it's a racket.

407
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,075
Scott: And if you have a good result, you're like, "Oh,

408
00:21:55,196 --> 00:21:55,398
Scott: okay.".

409
00:21:55,641 --> 00:22:05,200
Rym: But again, because it's technology, because it's relatively easy to compete with technology if you have superior technology, and it's primarily just software, there are plenty of other search engines.

410
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,919
Scott: That all suck?

411
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:07,180
Rym: Yeah.

412
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,600
Rym: And, I mean, Bing pretty much gives you equivalent results.

413
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Rym: It's not really better or worse for what most people search for.

414
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,597
Scott: I mean, for normal searches, like, "Oh, I forgot the name of that

415
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:18,000
Scott: website.".

416
00:22:18,382 --> 00:22:19,266
Scott: Or, "What's the URL?

417
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:21,638
Scott: I remember everything about this page, but I forget the

418
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:22,040
Scott: URL.".

419
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,040
Scott: It's fine.

420
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,940
Scott: But if you actually need to research something, good luck.

421
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:38,800
Rym: But I feel like, technology-wise, I'm 100% okay with 100% black box searches, even if there's only one dominant provider, simply because, one, SEO people don't deserve jobs.

422
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,333
Rym: Sure.

423
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:41,380
Scott: And, two, they're mostly dead anyway.

424
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:50,240
Rym: If the results are actually unusable or are causing an actual problem, it would be trivial to then start competing with Google.

425
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:58,080
Rym: The only reason you wouldn't be able to compete with Google right now is because your "on paper better" search engine isn't actually better.

426
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,940
Scott: That's the other major problem, right?

427
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:09,920
Scott: I was just saying how someone with a tiny company, in software at least, can easily just make a better technology and compete with big boys, just like Facebook competed with Myspace.

428
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,040
Scott: I mean, a lot of super nerds use that.

429
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,520
Rym: There's that DuckDuckGo search that all the super nerds and varchanners use.

430
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:25,675
Scott: But the software of Google search is so ridiculously advanced that it would be -- it's the same reason.

431
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,960
Scott: no one compete with Photoshop, right?

432
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,640
Scott: It's just so hard to make any kind of competitor for that.

433
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:34,180
Scott: The effort required, you could never catch up to that.

434
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:48,400
Rym: Ah, but what I'm arguing is that if they were providing results based on some shady cabal that had the effect of making the search results less useful, then someone, by simply making search results that were actually useful, would beat them.

435
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:53,600
Rym: And if they're not making them less useful, then there's no way -- But it's still a shady cabal?

436
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:55,999
Rym: Well, it doesn't matter.

437
00:23:57,421 --> 00:24:03,520
Scott: Well, maybe they're still the most useful of all the search engines, but could be more useful.

438
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,640
Scott: But they're not as useful as they could be, even though they're still the most useful because of a shady cabal.

439
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,900
Rym: But if they could be more useful, then there would be space for a competitor.

440
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:20,120
Scott: Ah, but that would be so difficult for the competitor to get into that space because Google is already so good.

441
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:33,619
Scott: Like, if Photoshop just sat still and left room for improvement, and we started to catch up, and then they just moved a little bit ahead and always stayed one step ahead of us, and we couldn't catch them just because they're so big and so awesome.

442
00:24:35,662 --> 00:24:39,820
Scott: As opposed to what they're actually doing, which is update Photoshop constantly and stay way ahead of everybody.

443
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:53,419
Rym: Europe's answer to this perceived problem, which mostly rests around a lot of very specific and, in my opinion, really stupid complaints about the search results, are they want to break Google up because that's their solution to it.

444
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,360
Scott: Yes, I would like to break up a lot of European companies, too.

445
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,881
Scott: The U.S.

446
00:24:56,922 --> 00:25:02,020
Scott: would love to break up Honda, Toyota, BMW, Volkswagen.

447
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,360
Scott: Oh, wouldn't that be so great?

448
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,900
Scott: Probably these American car companies.

449
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,100
Scott: Just bust up all these European and Japanese car companies.

450
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:13,640
Scott: One company per car, the Camry company, the Corolla company.

451
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,980
Scott: You can't share engineers with each other.

452
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:17,839
Scott: Yeah, that'd be great.

453
00:25:19,262 --> 00:25:21,660
Scott: Every country wants to bust up all this country's shit.

454
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,220
Rym: Blackberry released a new smartphone.

455
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,740
Scott: Wait, Blackberry's still around?

456
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,239
Rym: Yeah, they have Passport smartphones now.

457
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,018
Scott: Okay.

458
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,440
Rym: They call them the Passport.

459
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,360
Scott: What does it look like?

460
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,899
Rym: I'm pulling up a picture of it right now.

461
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,738
Rym: I'm trying to pull up a picture of it right now.

462
00:25:35,364 --> 00:25:37,240
Rym: Still trying to pull up, wow, the Blackberry side.

463
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:38,098
Rym: Here we go.

464
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,340
Scott: It's a square Blackberry.

465
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,580
Rym: They're really fat and they have a square screen.

466
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,500
Scott: Well, they're not fat thick, they're fat wide.

467
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:45,179
Rym: Fat wide.

468
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,079
Scott: But they're not tall.

469
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:46,637
Scott: No.

470
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,060
Scott: Even though they just said they sacrifice.

471
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,960
Scott: Oh, no, look at that picture.

472
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,499
Rym: That's still taller than my phone.

473
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,959
Rym: That's really tall.

474
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,879
Scott: It's not that tall.

475
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:56,919
Rym: It's basically a tablet with a low resolution screen and an awful looking physical keyboard.

476
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,099
Scott: So it looks like you can hold it in your hand.

477
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,039
Rym: That's not the news.

478
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,039
Scott: It's a one handed feeling.

479
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,580
Rym: Blackberry is, this is literally, as far as I can say, their last gasp.

480
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,180
Rym: They will give you cash if you trade your iPhone in for a Passport instead.

481
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,000
Scott: What kind of iPhone?

482
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:18,902
Rym: A 4S, they'll give you $90.

483
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:20,120
Scott: No, I could just get that on your Mac.

484
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,103
Rym: An iPhone 6, they will give you $400.

485
00:26:24,103 --> 00:26:26,320
Scott: I spent more than $400 for my iPhone 6.

486
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:33,900
Rym: Yeah, so basically, they'll give you less than market value in credit toward their Passport smartphone.

487
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,040
Scott: What are they going to do with my iPhone?

488
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,640
Scott: Sell it on the internet, on Craigslist?

489
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,280
Rym: That's what I'm wondering.

490
00:26:38,922 --> 00:26:40,320
Rym: If they give you money.

491
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,900
Scott: Are they going to pay my cancellation fee at Verizon?

492
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,338
Rym: Yeah, it doesn't look like it.

493
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,620
Scott: You're not helping.

494
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:51,380
Scott: Also, why would you pay me to, you should, to downgrade, you need to make up for the difference.

495
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,300
Scott: You need to give me money equal to the value between the quality of the iPhone and the quality of the body.

496
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:03,660
Scott: You need to give me like the thousand dollars to make up for the quality difference between the two phones.

497
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:11,080
Rym: So basically, they're going to buy iPhones for under market value from people to get them to use their Blackberry Passport.

498
00:27:11,902 --> 00:27:16,200
Rym: And then I guess resell those iPhones in the secondary market.

499
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,080
Scott: Instead, you should just give people Blackberries for free, make them run Android or some shit.

500
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,820
Scott: But you have the ability to make hardware, good hardware.

501
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:26,039
Scott: You know, you have that ability.

502
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,160
Rym: I don't think they do anymore.

503
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,700
Scott: Make the best Android phone that exists because it's not hard to make.

504
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,870
Scott: Try making a small one.

505
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:38,940
Scott: Put it out there and your brand still means something.

506
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,020
Scott: If you made a high quality, small stock.

507
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,760
Rym: I don't think their brand means anything, Scott, among people under the age of 48.

508
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,460
Scott: If they made a high quality, small stock Android phone, which any of these phone companies could do, but none of them do, they could make a comeback.

509
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:56,840
Scott: Instead of trying to be Blackberry, just don't be who you are anymore because who you are is bad.

510
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:58,640
Rym: They're definitely not capable of that.

511
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,618
Scott: They're capable of it.

512
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,539
Scott: If I was the CEO of Blackberry, I could make it happen.

513
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,933
Rym: Yeah, the features include extra loud speakerphone, 350% louder than the Samsung Galaxy S5.

514
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,799
Scott: That's a feature they've always had.

515
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,700
Rym: The features of Blackberry basically scream, literally, I am old.

516
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:18,458
Scott: I am designed by an old man.

517
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:19,899
Rym: And I am for old.

518
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:26,600
Scott: But that tells me the person who made that phone is so old, their hardware skills must be incredible.

519
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,267
Rym: Maybe.

520
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,930
Scott: They can make a really tiny, awesome phone.

521
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,160
Scott: if only I was telling them what to make.

522
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,579
Rym: So let's get this straight.

523
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:43,080
Rym: Blackberry is basically saying, if you translate this advertising thing, our phones are so shitty, we have to pay people to use them.

524
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:43,698
Rym: Yes.

525
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:50,300
Rym: Or give us your iPhone so we can then resell it for a profit on the secondary market.

526
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:56,380
Scott: Or, man, we're stuck with a warehouse full of shitty Blackberries.

527
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,079
Scott: Maybe we can trick people to trade them for much better iPhones.

528
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:00,620
Rym: Oh, my God, it gets even better.

529
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,020
Rym: You don't actually get a credit.

530
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:08,799
Rym: You pay the full price of the phone and you get a Visa prepaid card with the credit on it.

531
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:10,467
Rym: Wow.

532
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:11,434
Rym: Okay.

533
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:14,680
Rym: I'm amazed that -- if this company should really just take all the --.

534
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,479
Scott: Has anyone done this?

535
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,298
Scott: You know who's done this?

536
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,060
Scott: Someone who stole an iPhone.

537
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:18,799
Scott: Yup.

538
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,018
Scott: That's who's doing this.

539
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,618
Scott: Basically GameStop.

540
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,213
Rym: Wow, the passport costs 600 bucks.

541
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,880
Scott: Listen, tiny phones are expensive.

542
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,880
Scott: It doesn't matter who makes them.

543
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,579
Rym: It's not that tiny.

544
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,379
Scott: There's hardware in there that costs a lot.

545
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,260
Rym: The Sony Z3C is only 640.

546
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,345
Rym: Yeah.

547
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,402
Rym: Oh, maybe 540.

548
00:29:36,402 --> 00:29:43,359
Scott: Listen, regardless of how well-designed your phone is or what software is on it, the pieces inside are expensive regardless of how you arrange them.

549
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:43,940
Rym: Yeah.

550
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:51,140
Rym: What's the iPhone 6 if you buy it completely contractless and unsubsidized as well, like 750?

551
00:29:51,140 --> 00:30:01,189
Scott: Just add up the price of all those parts separately, then add on the cost of the factory that puts them together and the labor and the testing and, you know, any phone that's modern is going to be 600, 700 bucks.

552
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:09,690
Rym: So, things of the day.

553
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,789
Rym: I got two tiny little things.

554
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,610
Rym: So, Russian darts.

555
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:15,609
Rym: This is just Russian darts.

556
00:30:16,755 --> 00:30:17,669
Rym: Just watch this video.

557
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,190
Rym: It escalates to the appropriate humorous point and then stops.

558
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:32,590
Rym: So, my other thing, Scott and I talked about this a long time ago, but the video's from 2005 before we started doing GeekNights publicly.

559
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,430
Rym: So, it doesn't appear that we've ever actually used this as a thing of the day.

560
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,790
Scott: It's way older than 2005.

561
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,711
Rym: From Tom's Hardware, February of 2005.

562
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:43,170
Scott: It feels older, but that's fine.

563
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,490
Rym: Uploaded in 2006.

564
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,890
Rym: This was uploaded to YouTube.

565
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:54,569
Scott: I remember downloading this video, downloading, in video file format before YouTube, like, it was a thing.

566
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,950
Rym: This was uploaded by some guy.

567
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,489
Scott: This exact video, I have the files for it.

568
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:13,830
Rym: So, the video, nowadays computers are a lot more sophisticated, but this was a time where if you took the heat sink off of a CPU, the magic smoke would come out in many cases, especially with AMD chips, before you finished taking the heat sink off.

569
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,930
Scott: Well, this was like the era where we did the most computer building in late college, right?

570
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,810
Scott: With Pentium 3s, Pentium 4s, AMD Athlons.

571
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:24,222
Rym: Yeah, right up pretty much from the K7 800 up through the Thunderbird era.

572
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:26,961
Scott: Right.

573
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:36,628
Scott: So, basically, the deal was is that if you took the heat sink off an Intel chip, the Intel chip would go, "Oh my God, I'm hot," and it would just stop at doing anything because it was too hot.

574
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,830
Scott: The AMD chip was dumb as a brick and would go, "Keep doing stuff," and then set on fire without the heat sink.

575
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,130
Rym: Now, keep doing stuff, it had a couple of milliseconds of keep doing stuff.

576
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,789
Scott: Listen, it doesn't take that long.

577
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,870
Rym: Yeah, like Intel Pentium 3 1000.

578
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,530
Scott: The Pentium 4 was even more advanced.

579
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:59,070
Scott: It would stop processing, and if you put the heat sink back on, as soon as the temperature went down, it would start doing stuff again.

580
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:09,410
Rym: It's just amazing to watch that all the Intel chips, the game just crashes, and then the chips are pretty much okay, and all the AMD chips, you take it off, and smoke just starts billowing out of the chips immediately.

581
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:25,090
Scott: Now, this is something that most people would never even encounter because they don't take their heat sink off their CPU ever, so it doesn't seem like a worthwhile feature to pay for, but it's little things like this that are the reason why I stick with Intel over AMD through this day.

582
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:29,950
Scott: The reasons like this are the reasons why I stick with Nvidia over ATI to this day.

583
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:35,869
Scott: Even if those other companies make up for it, and this is only one example, I'll give you another example, right?

584
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,930
Scott: So, this is a very tiny thing that most people will never notice.

585
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:45,010
Scott: We had built an HTPC, the first one we built, and I had an ATI GPU in there.

586
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,890
Rym: Oh yeah, because it had that S-video port on the back.

587
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:55,150
Scott: I had an ATI GPU in there, ATI video card, and we plugged in an S-video cable, and when you turned the computer on, you couldn't see anything on the screen.

588
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,149
Scott: It wasn't until the OS loaded and the driver loaded that it showed anything on the TV.

589
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:03,949
Scott: It would only output to the VGA port when you turned the computer on.

590
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:13,870
Scott: But, with the Nvidia video card, it doesn't matter if it was the VGA, S-video, or whatever other video port on there, you could see the BIOS posting on all those video outs.

591
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:23,690
Scott: A very small feature, almost no one would notice that, but it makes a big difference if you're trying to set up an HTPC, and I'm sure maybe these things have been fixed in more modern hardware.

592
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,330
Rym: Yeah, and a lot of these things are anecdotal.

593
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,446
Rym: It just so happened that...

594
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,130
Scott: Right, that one particular card we had, right, that we happen to have, that cheapo one, right?

595
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:32,048
Scott: I'm sure.

596
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,010
Scott: It might not even be the GPU's fault.

597
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,990
Scott: It might be the card maker's fault in that case.

598
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,109
Rym: Well, you know, it shows something else too.

599
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,950
Rym: People seem to... Nowadays, it's really easy to build a computer.

600
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:41,408
Rym: Oh yeah.

601
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:48,749
Rym: But, back in the day, if you put the wrong RAM chip in a computer, you might literally ruin the CPU and the RAM chip.

602
00:33:49,551 --> 00:34:06,023
Rym: Like, you could mess up installing a computer in non-obvious ways, and when I used to build computers, like the first time you post it, you turn it on, there was the crippling fear that it wouldn't post, because if that happened, nowadays, usually that just means, yeah, you've got to plug something in.

603
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:08,830
Rym: Or, power supply is not powerful enough.

604
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,489
Rym: In the old days, it was even odds that that meant you broke something.

605
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:13,529
Scott: You're fucked.

606
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,790
Rym: You ruined something, and there's no way to tell what.

607
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:16,306
Scott: Yep.

608
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,899
Scott: But yeah, it's little things like that.

609
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:26,170
Scott: that just, you know, I've seen throughout history, the reasons for certain brand loyalties, and they have never steered me wrong so far.

610
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:32,190
Scott: When I had AMD's for a long period of time, I have a bunch of AMD CPUs.

611
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,070
Scott: Why do I have so many AMD CPUs?

612
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:35,869
Scott: Oh, that's why.

613
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:42,089
Scott: That's why I don't have as many Intel CPUs, because they didn't fuck up and never had to be replaced.

614
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:42,641
Rym: Yep.

615
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,509
Scott: Why do I have a bunch of AMD power supplies?

616
00:34:45,935 --> 00:34:46,788
Scott: Oh, that's why.

617
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:53,609
Rym: Well, part of that, too, is that the curve of power, like the Pentium 4 was way expensive for how fast it was.

618
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,982
Rym: Yep.

619
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,750
Rym: So the K7s came in, they're like, yeah, we're way faster and way cheaper.

620
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,309
Scott: You're faster like the way a hot rod is faster.

621
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:01,850
Scott: Yep.

622
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,110
Scott: Leaving fire all over the ground.

623
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,829
Rym: And you know what?

624
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:09,910
Rym: It wasn't until, like, past the Core 2 Duo that I was like, yep, Intel.

625
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,530
Scott: The Core 2 Duo is when Intel retook the throne.

626
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:13,385
Rym: Yep.

627
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:14,843
Rym: And remained in it.

628
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,409
Rym: And now, like the Core, like the i5, i7, I can't imagine buying a non-Intel CPU.

629
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,510
Scott: So I would like to see someone make one that I could believe in, but no one has.

630
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,770
Rym: Should we break them up with their monopoly?

631
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:29,030
Scott: They are, but they're not using their monopoly power to any evil effect.

632
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,528
Scott: How do you know?

633
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:32,410
Scott: What are they doing with their CPU monopoly?

634
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:35,790
Rym: Maybe they're using it as monopolized engineering resources that no one can ever-.

635
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,409
Scott: An example of something Intel could do is be like, you know what?

636
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:44,530
Scott: We're gonna make our Intel CPUs such that the only OS that will run on our computers is Intel OS.

637
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,568
Scott: Fuck everyone else.

638
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,730
Scott: Fuck you, Microsoft.

639
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:47,589
Scott: Fuck you, Linux.

640
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,889
Scott: Fuck you, OS X. Everyone has to use Intel OS now or use some other CPU.

641
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,208
Scott: And you think everyone's gonna use some other CPU?

642
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:57,647
Scott: 'Cause there isn't one.

643
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,789
Rym: Remember the alpha chips?

644
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,189
Scott: DEC alpha?

645
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,749
Scott: Those are not for normal people.

646
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,950
Scott: Yeah, there was a time- That's way earlier than- You used to be able to run Windows on that shit.

647
00:36:07,694 --> 00:36:10,709
Scott: That was a ridiculously long time ago.

648
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,429
Scott: Yeah, it was.

649
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,208
Scott: It's not even relevant.

650
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:16,530
Rym: So in- Oh, you gotta think of the day.

651
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:17,206
Scott: I do.

652
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:22,790
Scott: So there's a thing I learned about called mispronounced incoming Schleren optics.

653
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:33,509
Scott: So I'd still, even after reading Wikipedia and a whole bunch of different documents and watching YouTube videos, I only marginally understand how this works.

654
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:53,527
Scott: Basically, with the combination of a point light source that's really bright, a razor blade, the kind you shave with, a big awesome mirror, and some other reflecting type things, you can look into the mirror and actually see basically the density of air.

655
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,640
Scott: So if you look at a lot of the example videos, someone will be lighting a candle or blowing a fan.

656
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:10,570
Scott: Something that heats up the air or maybe an ice cube or something that makes air have different refractive indexes.

657
00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:13,268
Scott: And then you look into the mirror and it's like, "Whoa, you can

658
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:13,429
Scott: see.".

659
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,328
Scott: And as soon as you see what this looks like, you're like, "Oh, I've seen that before

660
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:16,590
Scott: somewhere.".

661
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:18,109
Scott: That sort of effect.

662
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,070
Scott: Well, it's called Schleren optics.

663
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:25,530
Scott: And if you read, maybe you can figure out how it works better than I can.

664
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,330
Scott: The razor blade is the really confusing part.

665
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,132
Rym: Yeah.

666
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:34,950
Rym: It's like when I was in high school physics and we were learning about polarization and quantum stuff.

667
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:38,570
Rym: And the teacher did the experiment with the strange attractors.

668
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,930
Rym: He puts a polarizer, then he puts another one, and now there's no light going through it.

669
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,970
Rym: Then he puts a third polarizer between the two and light came through again.

670
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:46,640
Rym: And I was like, "What the

671
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:47,189
Rym: fuck?".

672
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,969
Rym: And then it took him the entire class to actually explain it.

673
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:51,272
Scott: Right.

674
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:56,950
Scott: So here's some videos of this Schleren optics that you can watch for awesomeness.

675
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:04,790
Rym: In the meta moment, the Book Club book is Watership Down, the classic tale of rabbit adventure, rabbit cultists, and rabbit fascists.

676
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,170
Scott: How about the next Book Club book, which is Fire Car Up?

677
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,266
Rym: Yeah, Scott, I'm done with Watership Down.

678
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,130
Scott: I read it.

679
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,139
Scott: Isn't it like a kid's book?

680
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,130
Scott: I'm sure it won't take me long.

681
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:15,693
Rym: It's 413 pages.

682
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,783
Scott: That is much longer than I expected.

683
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:19,529
Scott: What's the font size?

684
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:24,725
Rym: The first edition, so normal book from the '70s, was 413 '70s book pages.

685
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:29,810
Scott: Oh, well, I have it on Kindle, so I'm gonna get readin', I guess.

686
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:31,536
Rym: I really liked it.

687
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:34,369
Rym: Also, I need you to give me a link so I can actually post it.

688
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,730
Scott: Uh, why do you need me to give you a link?

689
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,545
Rym: So we get money if you click on it and buy it.

690
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:40,110
Rym: I need the referral link.

691
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,670
Scott: Our secrets!

692
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:41,737
Rym: Yeah.

693
00:38:42,993 --> 00:38:44,730
Rym: So guys, if you want to support GeekNights, buy the book.

694
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:54,990
Scott: If you buy a Book Club book and you click the link that is on our site when you bought that book, it is an Amazon affiliate link, and we get a ridiculously small amount of money if you do that.

695
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:58,470
Rym: If you buy other things in that same session, we also get some money.

696
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:00,870
Scott: It's also a ridiculously small amount of money.

697
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:07,310
Rym: But if you're gonna buy a couple of HDTVs and a new computer, might as well buy Watership Down along the way.

698
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:14,370
Scott: But also make sure to go to smile.amazon.com so that money will go to the charity of your choice, which cannot be us.

699
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:14,985
Scott: Yes.

700
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,169
Scott: I wonder if it's possible to get an affiliate fee and the Smile charity at the same time.

701
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:23,190
Scott: Or is it just the affiliate fees that go to the Smile charity?

702
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,161
Rym: I'm not 100% sure.

703
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:25,270
Scott: Yeah.

704
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:26,769
Scott: I was never quite clear on how that works.

705
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:31,330
Scott: My Smile charity keeps changing between Creative Commons and Child's Play, and I can't keep it under control.

706
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,745
Scott: It keeps wanting to switch around, and I'm like, "What are you

707
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:34,088
Scott: doing?".

708
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:34,770
Rym: Yeah.

709
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,892
Rym: Actually, I was looking into.

710
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:39,942
Rym: Child's Play has launched a thing where we can set up an account.

711
00:39:40,423 --> 00:39:43,030
Rym: that is an event runner account, not just a donator account.

712
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,970
Rym: And basically, you don't even really need a lot of permission.

713
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:53,849
Rym: We can do any arbitrary event, and there's just a widget we put, and the widget, it just credits us like, "Yeah, these guys caused that donation to

714
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:54,090
Rym: happen.".

715
00:39:54,171 --> 00:39:55,830
Rym: But otherwise, we don't even touch the money.

716
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,990
Rym: It just goes straight to Child's Play.

717
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:08,470
Rym: So if you can think of a cool thing that you would donate money for me and Scott to do, we will consider doing some sort of live stream where if you keep putting money in, we'll keep doing that thing.

718
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,289
Rym: Maybe a DDR-a-thon?

719
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:10,901
Rym: I don't know.

720
00:40:13,093 --> 00:40:15,290
Scott: I do not think we would survive a very long DDR-a-thon.

721
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,950
Rym: Well, you know how Desert Bus works, right?

722
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,149
Scott: Keeps switching off?

723
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:18,498
Scott: No.

724
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:19,870
Rym: People switch off.

725
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,010
Scott: Oh, we increase the price of doing another song?

726
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,050
Scott: We should also multiply by the number of feet in the song.

727
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:26,714
Scott: Ooh.

728
00:40:27,331 --> 00:40:28,703
Scott: Oh, you want us to do Dropout?

729
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,230
Scott: All right, well, it's going to be like a bajillion dollars.

730
00:40:31,371 --> 00:40:32,867
Rym: You're going to give $1,000 to Child's Play?

731
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:33,150
Rym: Okay.

732
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,122
Rym: Rym will do Dropout, and then, "Oh, look, Rym passed out because he's an old man.

733
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,065
Rym: He can't DDR

734
00:40:37,126 --> 00:40:37,507
Rym: anymore.".

735
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:39,277
Scott: Max 300?

736
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:41,390
Scott: Yeah, that'll be the rest of the money we're trying to raise.

737
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:49,510
Rym: Yeah, you know what, old man Rym, I think I am physically incapable of passing max 300 on Maniac at this point.

738
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,630
Scott: I am definitely.

739
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:52,217
Rym: I did it once.

740
00:40:52,418 --> 00:40:54,969
Rym: There was a time when I could barely do it.

741
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:59,270
Rym: I don't think I can move my feet fast enough to do it.

742
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,129
Rym: I think I literally cannot dance DDR like that anymore.

743
00:41:03,553 --> 00:41:07,113
Rym: It's a sad day to be this old at 32.

744
00:41:07,113 --> 00:41:07,627
Scott: Don't get old.

745
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:08,750
Rym: Don't get old.

746
00:41:08,872 --> 00:41:09,306
Scott: Too old.

747
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:18,790
Rym: So, I needed a new computer for work, and the CTO was like, "You can't waste the time building a computer.

748
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:20,123
Rym: Just buy a Dell or

749
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:20,527
Rym: something.".

750
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:30,150
Scott: Right, so what I did for work usually when I needed a new computer is I either got a Lenovo ThinkPad, which now is no longer the greatest option, or I got the Dell Optiplex.

751
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:53,769
Scott: The Dell Optiplex, which I had in my previous job, is just a normal old desktop-y, tower-ish computer that comes in four different sizes, but the one thing about it is that when you open up the side, which is actually surprisingly easy to open for a Dell computer, the things arranged inside are very, very nicely arranged, and it was actually quite easy to put in a video card and other modifications I needed to make when I had one.

752
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:58,264
Scott: So, that was six, seven years ago.

753
00:41:58,304 --> 00:41:59,810
Scott: I don't know what's changed since then.

754
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:09,450
Rym: Plus, also, as we talked about on a previous Monday episode of GeekNights, none of those pre-built computers give you the kinds of options that you actually need, like multiple hard drives.

755
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:21,670
Scott: Well, sure, but because it was so easy to open, I just bought the stock one that had the right CPU and the right amount of RAM, and then the video card I just bought on Newegg, that kind of stuff.

756
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:26,049
Rym: So, I bought the Newegg iBuyPower desktop Intel configurator PC.

757
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,450
Scott: Oh, so one of those configurators, but what the hell is iBuyPower?

758
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:34,928
Rym: So, I actually tried to figure that out, and I can't.

759
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,418
Rym: So, I think it's a separate company.

760
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:40,790
Rym: Maybe it's the company that bought Newegg or bought part of Newegg.

761
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:41,530
Scott: No one bought Newegg.

762
00:42:42,152 --> 00:42:44,370
Rym: You don't know a lot about Newegg's internal stuff, do you?

763
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:44,791
Rym: I know,

764
00:42:44,811 --> 00:43:06,230
Scott: but I went to the iBuyPower website, and that seems to be a website where you configure a computer, and it's actually a really powerful configurator that lets you configure a lot of details of the computer, except they put it together for you instead of you having to build it, and they give you a lot of good options that Dell and other people don't give you for desktop computers, even laptops also.

765
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:16,490
Scott: But then if you go to Newegg, there's an item that you can buy on Newegg, which is the iBuyPower configurator built into Newegg, and you order through Newegg, and it's very strange.

766
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:28,910
Rym: So, there's a lot of weird relationships between Newegg and a lot of other companies, and I really can't figure out what Newegg's full deal is.

767
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,850
Scott: iBuyPower is definitely smaller than Newegg.

768
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,379
Rym: Quote, "On September 28, 2009, Newegg filed for an

769
00:43:32,439 --> 00:43:32,540
Rym: IPO.".

770
00:43:34,816 --> 00:43:35,029
Scott: Yep.

771
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,647
Rym: "The filing stated Newegg had been profitable, blah, blah, blah, blah,

772
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:38,030
Rym: blah.".

773
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,741
Scott: Where's the IPO?

774
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:39,169
Scott: I want in.

775
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:42,607
Rym: "In 2011, the company withdrew its registration for filing an

776
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:43,009
Rym: IPO.".

777
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,164
Scott: No, bring it back.

778
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:44,529
Scott: I want it.

779
00:43:44,952 --> 00:43:46,049
Rym: I don't know if I would invest in them.

780
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:46,790
Scott: I would buy Newegg.

781
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:56,080
Rym: So, anyway, Newegg is the place that, you know, we always talk about, like, any show like this, GeekNights, anything, will always say, "Oh, gonna get a computer?

782
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,344
Rym: Go to Newegg, buy all the

783
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:57,525
Rym: parts.".

784
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:12,210
Rym: However, a lot of times, a friend of ours, a listener, a mother, a grandmother, a coworker who is not in your inner circle of friends will say, "Hey, Rym, you know a lot about computers.

785
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:13,501
Rym: What computers should I

786
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:13,804
Rym: buy?".

787
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:15,989
Rym: That's the voice of someone who isn't me.

788
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:24,450
Scott: Well, nowadays, my advice is, if you are not doing media production, gaming, or coding, why do you need a computer?

789
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:42,530
Scott: Yeah, okay, philosophically, you should still get a real computer such that you will have the ability to do those three things if you so desire, or, you know, your horizons will not be limited by having, you know, a less powerful device, you know, and maybe having that more powerful device will open new worlds to you.

790
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:49,990
Scott: Like, when I bought a fancier camera, I thought I might have been throwing my money away, but actually, because I got the fancy one, I started caring about cameras more.

791
00:44:50,372 --> 00:44:57,982
Scott: Maybe if I make this person get a fancy desktop, they will care about computers more, and it'll be good for them, but honestly, just get a fucking iPad.

792
00:44:58,002 --> 00:44:59,568
Scott: You don't need a real computer anymore.

793
00:44:59,648 --> 00:44:59,950
Scott: The end.

794
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:07,649
Rym: Yeah, and the main reason for me is that if someone asks you, "What computer should I

795
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:07,850
Rym: get?"

796
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:16,330
Rym: and they follow your advice, they're going to call you when anything goes wrong with that computer for the rest of your collective lives.

797
00:45:17,471 --> 00:45:29,670
Rym: So, as a result, I'm very hesitant to recommend basically any technology to anyone that I know who isn't, like, a listener of GeekNights and I'm just talking at you and you can't respond to me and don't know my phone number.

798
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:38,769
Scott: These days, I tell people to get an iPad, and if they need a real computer for some reason, but they don't need, like, a real, real computer, get the Surface Pro.

799
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:47,670
Scott: I mean, it's a real-for-reals laptop that's totally modern and supported, and it's actually probably one of the best Windows laptops you can get.

800
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:52,588
Rym: Though, depending on the person, I might suggest that they get an old ThinkPad Lenovo X230.

801
00:45:53,810 --> 00:46:02,107
Scott: Yeah, if you don't need, like, the newest CPU and, like, it's not going to matter, why not get an older but still brand new ThinkPad?

802
00:46:03,352 --> 00:46:06,890
Scott: You know, I have a 220 for myself and a 230 at work, and they're both just fine.

803
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,410
Rym: Yep, I got a 230 for myself and a coworker has a 240, and I looked at it, and it's not better.

804
00:46:11,775 --> 00:46:11,950
Scott: Nope.

805
00:46:12,912 --> 00:46:14,710
Rym: And, in fact, it's worse in a few material ways.

806
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,230
Rym: So, I think the first thing you got to do is, like, you know, you said just tell them about an iPad.

807
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,830
Rym: You have to get them to answer a simple question.

808
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:24,289
Rym: What are you going to use this computer for?

809
00:46:25,893 --> 00:46:28,110
Rym: And, like, you know, your parents want to ask for a new computer.

810
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:29,796
Scott: I'm like, what do you do with it?

811
00:46:29,816 --> 00:46:31,405
Scott: You just, you know, visit websites.

812
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:32,390
Scott: The iPad does that.

813
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:32,710
Scott: Yep.

814
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:39,809
Rym: And then, depending on their answers, unless they trigger a thing that requires a computer, just tell them to buy the iPad.

815
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:45,070
Scott: All right, so the one thing they said that was valid somewhat is there's some websites they go to.

816
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:50,210
Scott: You might need to fill out a form or do something on some website, and the iPad browser doesn't cut it.

817
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,770
Scott: You're going to need a desktop browser just to do a thing that requires a desktop browser.

818
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:55,629
Rym: Yep, that is true.

819
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,179
Scott: So, you know what you can get for that?

820
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:58,370
Scott: A Chromebook.

821
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:58,977
Rym: Nah.

822
00:46:59,710 --> 00:46:59,871
Scott: Right?

823
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:03,670
Scott: It runs real Chrome, and it can do things on real, legit websites you need to do.

824
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:04,010
Scott: Yep.

825
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:04,350
Scott: Like that.

826
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,530
Rym: But, like, if someone says, oh, I type a lot of stuff, like, I type a lot of emails.

827
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,390
Scott: You can get a keyboard and connect it to your iPad.

828
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:15,530
Rym: In fact, when we were at the beach, Emily was typing a big chunk of her novel on a Bluetooth keyboard synced to her iPhone.

829
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:16,289
Scott: There you go.

830
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,646
Rym: That totally worked in Google Docs.

831
00:47:17,707 --> 00:47:17,909
Rym: Just go.

832
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:19,430
Rym: Yeah, exactly.

833
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:32,750
Rym: I think part of the problem is that a lot of these people, meaning most people, they don't really understand the idea of modular interchangeable, like, if they hear Bluetooth, everything that supports Bluetooth supports Bluetooth.

834
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,429
Scott: Well, I mean, I told my parents, like, a whole bunch of times.

835
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:37,820
Scott: My mom was like, I want a bigger screen.

836
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,549
Scott: I'm like, just connect your iPad to the TV.

837
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,386
Scott: How can I do that with an Apple TV or this $50 cable?

838
00:47:42,386 --> 00:47:46,230
Scott: $50 is a lot less money than an entire computer.

839
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:53,530
Scott: And she didn't really understand what I was talking about until I connected my iPad to the TV and she saw it, and she was like, oh.

840
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:56,570
Scott: It's like they don't understand the words that are coming out of your mouth.

841
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,308
Scott: They have to see it to understand it.

842
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,750
Rym: So the questions are, do you need it to be portable?

843
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:03,749
Rym: Do you want to play games?

844
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,009
Scott: Modern games.

845
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,510
Scott: The newest, newest games.

846
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,890
Rym: Do you create anything?

847
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,550
Scott: Video, audio, code.

848
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,148
Rym: Significant amounts of text.

849
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,650
Scott: Photos, editing, as opposed to just immediately uploading direct from your phone to Facebook.

850
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:19,038
Rym: Yep.

851
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:33,809
Rym: So if I decide that someone needs an actual desktop computer, for whatever arbitrary criteria, I'm pretty much just going to point them at this iBuyPower desktop configurator, because the thing I got in my office is fine for what it is.

852
00:48:35,114 --> 00:48:36,025
Rym: It was put together inside.

853
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,410
Rym: It was really sparse, because it's a big case, mid-tower.

854
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,869
Rym: Tiny little ITX motherboard in there.

855
00:48:43,174 --> 00:48:44,670
Rym: And everything was wired correctly.

856
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:48,270
Rym: And it was wired reasonably well, because actually today I was typing.

857
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:51,450
Scott: Some guy who does nothing but wire computers all day was doing that.

858
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:51,900
Scott: Yeah.

859
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,865
Scott: It's like when I wire a computer, I've been doing it for years, but I've only done it 10, 20 times total.

860
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:58,609
Scott: I do a pretty good job.

861
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:04,250
Scott: But if I had to do that and nothing but that all day, my wiring would be a work of fucking art.

862
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,266
Scott: You'd be like, "Where are the

863
00:49:06,286 --> 00:49:06,650
Scott: wires?".

864
00:49:06,771 --> 00:49:07,780
Scott: I'd be like, "Where are they

865
00:49:07,881 --> 00:49:08,305
Scott: indeed?".

866
00:49:09,453 --> 00:49:13,048
Rym: My one job I had back when I was the guy... You had one job.

867
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:21,907
Rym: When I went and fixed fucked up situations back when I worked at the hospital, one time they sent me to a data center, and they're like, "There's a rack, and we don't know what the deal with it

868
00:49:22,028 --> 00:49:22,108
Rym: is.".

869
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,465
Rym: And I was like, "That's really

870
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:23,830
Rym: vague.".

871
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:25,025
Rym: And they're like, "Just go deal with

872
00:49:25,086 --> 00:49:25,126
Rym: it.".

873
00:49:25,771 --> 00:49:31,350
Rym: So I go, and I was surprised I didn't find a dead body inside of that rat's nest of cables.

874
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,118
Scott: Why is it always a rat's nest?

875
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,589
Scott: Why can't it be something else's nest?

876
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:37,849
Scott: There's got to be something worse than rat's nest.

877
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,597
Rym: Hobo nest.

878
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:40,710
Rym: New York City hobo nest.

879
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,310
Scott: Why can't it be like jellyfish legs?

880
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,350
Rym: I thought you were going to say jellyfish nest.

881
00:49:48,331 --> 00:49:49,530
Scott: Oh, a whole bunch of jellyfishes?

882
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:50,549
Rym: Yeah, that might be worse.

883
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:51,314
Rym: Snakes.

884
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:52,310
Rym: It was just a sea of snakes.

885
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:53,509
Rym: It was a mating ball.

886
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,529
Scott: Why did it have to be snakes?

887
00:49:54,732 --> 00:49:55,849
Rym: It was a snake mating ball.

888
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:56,502
Scott: There you go.

889
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:11,590
Rym: So, yeah, it was 18 1U servers in the same rack with some network equipment and everything, and let me tell you, I spent an entire work day rewiring that thing.

890
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:12,550
Scott: Were the lights blinking?

891
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:15,209
Rym: I just turned everything off, because fuck 'em.

892
00:50:16,317 --> 00:50:17,710
Scott: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

893
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:23,319
Rym: I remember, that job, it wasn't like, "Go figure this out and deal with it, and you got to be

894
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:23,605
Rym: careful.".

895
00:50:24,152 --> 00:50:26,025
Rym: The job was, "Fix it, we don't care

896
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:26,328
Rym: how.".

897
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:28,250
Rym: I was like the bad cop.

898
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,007
Rym: They'd send me in to take care of business.

899
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:30,949
Rym: It was a hospital.

900
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,170
Scott: You might have killed somebody.

901
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,650
Rym: Yeah, I'm pretty sure those servers were being used by nobody for nothing.

902
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,789
Scott: Why just turn them off and rip all the wires out?

903
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,550
Scott: Well, throw the wires in the trash and leave.

904
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:48,149
Rym: So I actually didn't turn them back on, because I was waiting to see if a ticket arose anywhere in the hospital asking about them.

905
00:50:49,233 --> 00:50:50,809
Rym: But then I quit, so I never found out.

906
00:50:52,673 --> 00:51:06,730
Scott: Yeah, for anyone who needs to know, the way to rewire a big mess like that, when you have things that are just connected to each other, and not to other random places, is you basically find one port on one machine, right next to it with a Sharpie, like one.

907
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:12,708
Scott: Find the other end of that wire on the other port, right next to that one, one, and then take the wire out.

908
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:22,750
Scott: And then do that until you've written numbers next to every single port, and then get all new cables and make them nice, going from one to one, two to two, three to three, et cetera.

909
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:29,868
Rym: I actually preferred the functional result, where instead I would simply look at each port and figure out, what does this port need to do?

910
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:32,410
Rym: And I wouldn't redo it on a one-to-one basis.

911
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:34,610
Rym: I'd redo it on a logically equivalent basis.

912
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:36,509
Scott: How do you know what the port needs to do?

913
00:51:37,372 --> 00:51:40,523
Scott: I mean, if it's just like a switch and it doesn't matter, you know any of these can go to any of those.

914
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:41,849
Scott: Most of them are Ethernet.

915
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,710
Rym: All I do is just figure out if they had to be on special VLANs or anything stupid like that.

916
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:49,650
Scott: Yeah, but sometimes it's like, oh, you know, this one has to go there.

917
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:59,210
Rym: Yeah, one of them were these like 40-foot null-modem cables plugged into these like jank-ass serial ports, and they went under into the raised floor and disappeared.

918
00:51:59,713 --> 00:52:02,010
Rym: And if I tugged on them, they were completely taut.

919
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:04,309
Rym: And I couldn't unplug that.

920
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:07,530
Scott: Someone at some point in time set that up.

921
00:52:08,111 --> 00:52:09,030
Rym: I suspect the rat got moved.

922
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:13,369
Scott: Well, I wish I was there on that day to see what was going on.

923
00:52:13,952 --> 00:52:20,090
Rym: The best part is that project, the one with the serial cables, failed, and like that whole project was a disaster and collapsed.

924
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:24,470
Rym: So I never figured out where the other end of that serial cable went.

925
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:25,426
Rym: Just cut it.

926
00:52:26,418 --> 00:52:26,789
Rym: We did.

927
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:31,621
Rym: We cut the heads off as deep as we could get to them and left it with a little flag on the end.

928
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:36,890
Rym: that said, basically, it was a code that meant this cable is not used for anything.

929
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,030
Rym: If you ever find the other end of it, you can throw the whole thing away.

930
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:46,490
Scott: No, you can just go to every machine in the whole data center, cut all of them, and then when you pull all the ends, none of them should be taut.

931
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:52,049
Scott: You should all come out with half cables on every end, and then you can put them all in one bin.

932
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:56,590
Rym: So anyway, seriously, I knocked this thing over today at work.

933
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,710
Rym: The whole computer, facing forward, so the motherboard was on the top.

934
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:01,569
Rym: So it just fell.

935
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,358
Scott: You kicked it?

936
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,090
Scott: It was on the floor?

937
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:06,390
Rym: I just leaned back and kicked it the wrong way, and it just fell over.

938
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:09,363
Rym: And it was totally fine.

939
00:53:09,424 --> 00:53:10,209
Rym: Nothing came loose.

940
00:53:10,997 --> 00:53:12,250
Rym: So it was correctly put together.

941
00:53:12,871 --> 00:53:21,310
Rym: And my advice to anyone who needs to buy a computer is just go here, choose options that match your maximum budget, and click add to cart.

942
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,216
Rym: It'll be fine.

943
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,989
Rym: There's not that many options.

944
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:31,490
Scott: And the thing is, there's a lot of people who are still into the nerdery of overclocking.

945
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,550
Rym: If you're into that nerdery, build a computer from scratch.

946
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:41,169
Scott: Obviously, but there are some nerderies that I think just need to die, and that is one of them.

947
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:42,590
Rym: I'm thinking about overclocking my laptop.

948
00:53:42,855 --> 00:53:43,086
Rym: Why?

949
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:54,930
Rym: Because the Elgato encoding, if the CPU is less than 3.02 gigahertz, it cannot encode in real time 1080p 30.

950
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:59,461
Scott: You have the extremely rare, somewhat legit use case, but your laptop might explode.

951
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,690
Scott: Why not just buy another laptop?

952
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:01,208
Scott: You have money.

953
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,990
Rym: Because at this point it's cheaper.

954
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,369
Rym: I could just buy another computer and make that the streaming box.

955
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:11,350
Scott: Because you can afford to just buy another computer, why not overclock this one?

956
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,168
Scott: If it explodes, you'll just buy a new one.

957
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,230
Rym: The thing is, I need to overclock it.

958
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,190
Scott: And if it doesn't, you just saved yourself a bunch of money.

959
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,150
Rym: I need to overclock it so little.

960
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,020
Rym: Because it runs at 2.96 gigahertz.

961
00:54:22,312 --> 00:54:22,396
Rym: Wow.

962
00:54:24,237 --> 00:54:25,289
Rym: And the thing is, I tested.

963
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:29,350
Rym: I ran profilers, and I watched, and I'd encode different video.

964
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:34,470
Rym: It was amazing, because 1080p 30 was going fine on a static, simple to encode image.

965
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:37,167
Rym: But then I took the camera and went, "Woo, woo,

966
00:54:37,288 --> 00:54:37,449
Rym: woo!".

967
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:38,702
Rym: And the CPU went,

968
00:54:38,823 --> 00:54:39,106
Rym: "Max!".

969
00:54:40,984 --> 00:54:41,610
Rym: It was amazing.

970
00:54:43,252 --> 00:54:58,510
Scott: But yeah, most people who aren't encoding live streaming video with a laptop, even if you're playing games, the newest, newest possible games, the most ridiculous hardware they sell doesn't do anything.

971
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,011
Scott: I have a 680.

972
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:04,010
Scott: I'm still maxing out literally every game that Steam has to offer.

973
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:12,930
Rym: Well, no, it goes to show that the fact that it's almost 2015 proves something that we said back in 2005.

974
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:18,530
Rym: That if you're a nerd about computers, you can overclock to extend this further.

975
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:30,842
Rym: But if you invest in a high-quality, well-researched computer, and you buy top-of-the-line or second top-of-the-line, plateau-line components, and you overspend, I spent like

976
00:55:30,842 --> 00:55:32,230
Rym: $3,400. 680

977
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,390
Rym: was $500.

978
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:36,143
Rym: I spent well over $3,000 on the computer.

979
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,549
Scott: I do have 32 gigs of RAM.

980
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:45,551
Rym: But seriously, in 2009, the computer I'm using now, I bought for a bit over $3,000.

981
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:55,870
Rym: It is 100% sufficient to do Geek Guides, edit HD video and 4K video live, and do everything that I do with a computer, including playing super-modern games today.

982
00:55:56,291 --> 00:56:02,169
Rym: And I've spent a total of $500 upgrading it in the entire life of it so far.

983
00:56:02,169 --> 00:56:06,004
Rym: $600, I bought a new SSD yesterday.

984
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:22,109
Scott: Since I made this computer, which is pretty much around the time the 680 came out, so years ago, it has not needed any modification or upgrading whatsoever, and it is still effectively perfect as fast as any computer anyone could possibly need.

985
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:23,337
Rym: I found a use case.

986
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:24,790
Rym: I kind of need more RAM.

987
00:56:25,435 --> 00:56:27,210
Scott: I have 32 gigs, so how many do you have?

988
00:56:27,392 --> 00:56:28,392
Rym: So I have 12.

989
00:56:28,392 --> 00:56:28,989
Scott: Now you need more.

990
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:36,890
Scott: At work, I had four, and basically, I needed more, so I went up to eight, and now I'm only using like five at a time.

991
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:40,390
Rym: This computer has six DIMM slots.

992
00:56:41,217 --> 00:56:41,708
Scott: Oh, okay.

993
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,150
Rym: That's because I bought an awesome motherboard.

994
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:43,810
Scott: Do you have six times two?

995
00:56:44,912 --> 00:56:45,660
Rym: No, I don't, actually.

996
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,629
Rym: I do have room to put more in.

997
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:55,870
Rym: But the use case I ran into where I needed more than 12 was I was using an effect in Premiere, and I couldn't play it back live.

998
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:59,129
Rym: It was one of those effects that even with the CUDA rendering, you just can't.

999
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:03,190
Rym: Because it was an effect that basically, I figured out what it was doing.

1000
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:15,070
Rym: It analyzes all the frames, so it takes every frame into memory to do a calculation on the full set of the frames, and that's how it figures out what to do to all the frames.

1001
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:22,290
Rym: So you need enough RAM to hold the entire set of frames that you've selected for the effect in memory.

1002
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:24,229
Rym: To render it at all.

1003
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:36,329
Rym: Now, with Adobe Media Encoder, you can render it, and it'll deal with it, but if you want to do a preview render, or you want Premiere to render it itself, my RAM just went up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up.

1004
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:41,224
Scott: Well, for the preview, you can tell it, "Well, when I preview, only preview every other frame.

1005
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:42,249
Scott: Don't preview all the

1006
00:57:42,269 --> 00:57:42,470
Scott: frames.".

1007
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:43,276
Rym: Not with this effect.

1008
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,950
Rym: This effect, you didn't have that option.

1009
00:57:45,635 --> 00:57:46,590
Rym: It wasn't the display.

1010
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,330
Scott: You can also preview at half size.

1011
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:49,209
Rym: That wouldn't have helped.

1012
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,290
Scott: So that each frame takes up half as much space.

1013
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:54,249
Rym: Yeah, that doesn't affect the rendering of a preview.

1014
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:58,010
Rym: As opposed to the live playback preview.

1015
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:02,390
Rym: Anyway, I ran into a case where maybe 24 gigs of RAM would be useful.

1016
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:07,027
Scott: Yeah, for anything for a normal person, even today, where RAM is so cheap, you think, "Why

1017
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:07,110
Scott: not?".

1018
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:08,866
Scott: The reason I have 32, it was so cheap.

1019
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:09,290
Scott: Why not?

1020
00:58:10,011 --> 00:58:11,330
Rym: I feel like 8 is a good default.

1021
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:15,770
Scott: Yeah, if you have 8, you're not going to run into any problems whatsoever with any normal thing.

1022
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,790
Scott: At work, I have a virtual machine always open.

1023
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:28,370
Scott: I got two browsers, which use the most memory of anything, always open, and a whole bunch of other shit, like Outlook and stuff, and I'm using 5, at most, when I've got everything open.

1024
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,810
Rym: So here, this iBuyPower thing, here are your options for RAM.

1025
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:31,657
Rym: Every option.

1026
00:58:31,657 --> 00:58:33,070
Rym: 4 gigs of RAM.

1027
00:58:33,373 --> 00:58:33,748
Scott: Not enough.

1028
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,330
Rym: That's just included by default.

1029
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:36,961
Rym: Add $40 to get 8 gigs of RAM.

1030
00:58:38,095 --> 00:58:38,309
Scott: Done.

1031
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,050
Scott: Add $116 to have- So it's insignificantly more money.

1032
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:43,399
Rym: Add $116 to have 16 gigabytes of RAM.

1033
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,650
Scott: That's more than you're going to need ever.

1034
00:58:47,413 --> 00:58:52,290
Rym: Add $136 to have 16 gigabytes of G.Skill Ripjaws X-Series RAM.

1035
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:54,670
Scott: So no difference between the previous one whatsoever.

1036
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:55,756
Rym: Let me look at the details.

1037
00:58:55,938 --> 00:58:57,813
Rym: Maybe there's a slight difference in- There is.

1038
00:58:57,914 --> 00:58:58,801
Scott: RAM is RAM.

1039
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:00,010
Scott: Don't fall for that nonsense.

1040
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:00,415
Scott: Guess what?

1041
00:59:00,435 --> 00:59:02,190
Rym: They're both PC 1280.

1042
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:04,263
Scott: Yes, do not fall for the fancy RAM.

1043
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:05,290
Scott: All RAM is RAM.

1044
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:09,992
Rym: You know, I realize for all these years, me and most PC people say PC 1280.

1045
00:59:09,992 --> 00:59:14,944
Rym: It's actually 12,800.

1046
00:59:14,944 --> 00:59:15,330
Scott: Uh, whatever.

1047
00:59:15,592 --> 00:59:16,437
Rym: That's the rating.

1048
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,590
Rym: God, remember when CAS latency mattered?

1049
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:19,990
Rym: Yeah, whatever.

1050
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,509
Rym: Remember knowing what CAS latency was?

1051
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,130
Rym: Going for that CAS 2 RAM?

1052
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:23,850
Scott: No, I forgot what CAS latency was.

1053
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,667
Rym: Instead of the CAS 3, it was the refresh ratio.

1054
00:59:26,431 --> 00:59:26,686
Scott: Whatever.

1055
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:27,438
Rym: Yeah.

1056
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,110
Rym: But, yeah, I'll recommend this to anyone who wants a computer.

1057
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,790
Rym: Anyone who doesn't need a computer, I'll recommend an iPad.

1058
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:38,469
Rym: And if they want a laptop, either buy the cheapest possible laptop or a Surface Pro.

1059
00:59:39,112 --> 00:59:41,290
Scott: I recommend not buying the cheapest possible, right?

1060
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,390
Scott: The cheapest possible gets the job done.

1061
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:44,477
Scott: It's sort of miraculous.

1062
00:59:44,517 --> 00:59:45,664
Scott: Like, whoa, $200.

1063
00:59:45,664 --> 00:59:46,368
Scott: I got this computer.

1064
00:59:46,388 --> 00:59:46,670
Scott: It works.

1065
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,562
Scott: It does all these things.

1066
00:59:47,582 --> 00:59:48,030
Scott: Hooray.

1067
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:55,569
Scott: The only problem with those, and I know a lot of people who buy them because they just can't afford to buy the good one, and they need a computer now, is that they break.

1068
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,650
Scott: So as soon as you buy -- and it's not like the sunglasses strategy, right?

1069
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:05,330
Scott: I'll buy $20 sunglasses, and if they break, I'll just buy more $20 sunglasses, and it'll be fine.

1070
01:00:05,671 --> 01:00:09,650
Scott: And it'll be the same as if I just bought $200 sunglasses once with less risk.

1071
01:00:10,593 --> 01:00:15,410
Scott: If you lose or break your sunglasses, you can go without sunglasses until buying new ones.

1072
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,969
Scott: It's not really a big fucking deal.

1073
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:22,430
Scott: If your computer breaks, you need a fucking new computer immediately, like that moment.

1074
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:29,147
Scott: So if you buy a $200 computer, okay, that was all you could afford, great, but it's going to break, right?

1075
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:36,050
Scott: You get quality by spending -- not more money won't necessarily get you more quality, but the good stuff is more expensive.

1076
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:43,549
Rym: In my experience, the Asus craptops and the Asus just preconfigured laptops, like desktops and things, they're way better than they used to be.

1077
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,530
Scott: They're better than they used to be, but they're still not good.

1078
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:48,690
Rym: I don't get the impression they break anymore, they're just way underpowered.

1079
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:52,150
Scott: Not just underpowered, but it's like they will not get the job done.

1080
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:56,190
Scott: They will not last you the five plus years that my computers that I own have lasted.

1081
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:59,510
Rym: Those things don't buy you anything over an iPad.

1082
01:01:00,132 --> 01:01:00,929
Scott: That's also true.

1083
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:02,450
Rym: That's the real answer.

1084
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:05,910
Scott: You're not really saving anything by getting those, right?

1085
01:01:06,692 --> 01:01:11,724
Scott: Basically, when those break, you need to go out and buy another thing immediately, and again, you'll only be able to afford another $200 dude.

1086
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:23,766
Scott: You're better off saving the monies, suffering with whatever you happen to have now, whatever it is, just suffer with it until you can afford at least the $500 or $800 dealie.

1087
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:32,710
Scott: And once you get that, you're actually going to save money no matter how poor you are, because that thing will last you a fucking long ass time.

1088
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:37,450
Scott: If a computer doesn't last you five plus years, you did it wrong.

1089
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,010
Scott: I've never had a quality computer last less than five years.

1090
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:42,769
Scott: Usually more than five years they last.

1091
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,270
Rym: Yeah, so here's a good example.

1092
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:49,407
Rym: My computer now, even if I include upgrades, I spent a little over

1093
01:01:49,407 --> 01:01:52,558
Rym: $4,000. $4,000,

1094
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:52,679
Rym: right?

1095
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:54,170
Rym: That seems like a lot of money for a computer.

1096
01:01:55,413 --> 01:02:13,410
Rym: If I use it for the rest of next year, if I keep using it and it lasts until Christmas next year, Christmas 2015, and then I replace it, I'll have paid under $600 a year to have had a supercomputer for that entire time.

1097
01:02:14,512 --> 01:02:17,751
Scott: I mean, my computer was less than $2,000.

1098
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:21,450
Scott: I expect it to last at least six years, if not eight.

1099
01:02:21,911 --> 01:02:26,263
Scott: If we go with the conservative estimate of six, $2,000 divided by six years, right?

1100
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,529
Scott: That's saving a lot of monies there.

1101
01:02:33,732 --> 01:02:42,844
Rym: In fact, the Windows Experience Index on my computer is still... Oh, my RAM and processor hold it down now.

1102
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:44,593
Rym: 7.3.

1103
01:02:44,593 --> 01:02:45,347
Scott: I don't even know what mine is.

1104
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,152
Rym: Yeah, 7.3.

1105
01:02:48,152 --> 01:02:56,340
Rym: That's not too bad, actually, for a computer that built in 2009.

1106
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,420
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1107
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:03,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1108
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,940
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1109
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,880
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1110
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:16,620
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1111

1112
01:03:21,403 --> 01:03:24,440
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1113
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,560
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
