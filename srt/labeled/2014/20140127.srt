1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,817
Rym: It's Monday, January 27th, 2014.

2
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:10,058
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,657 --> 00:00:14,330
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,089
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, USB.

5
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:20,283
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:22,710
Rym: The

7
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:23,211
Rym: "usb.".

8
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:31,328
Rym: How come you jackasses will say "sequel" instead of "SQL" and you'll say "uet" instead of "uat" but you don't say

9
00:00:31,468 --> 00:00:31,668
Rym: "usb.".

10
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:36,589
Rym: It's one of the few things that actually bothers me.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,468
Rym: I mean, when someone says "jif" instead of

12
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:38,630
Rym: "dif."

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,155
Rym: Oh, really?

14
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:39,235
Scott: "Usb."

15
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:42,029
Scott: It doesn't bother me on that level.

16
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:47,030
Rym: Are you going to be able to say that without bothering yourself in the long term?

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,969
Scott: If it bothers you, I can forget the bothering of me.

18
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:57,409
Rym: From back in the IBM days, it's just when people would be like "blah, blah, blah,

19
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:57,750
Rym: sequel.".

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,573
Rym: I'd be like, "What?

21
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:00,080
Rym: Sequel?".

22
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:06,990
Rym: But I've found that "sequel" and "uat" are getting said more and more in my circles.

23
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:08,949
Rym: I don't know how to fight against this tide.

24
00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:11,868
Scott: Uh, you just keep saying "SQL"?

25
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:12,955
Rym: Yeah, I do.

26
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:13,599
Rym: I say

27
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,222
Rym: "uat.".

28
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,550
Rym: I guess I could just correct them.

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,050
Rym: Or I could act like I have no idea what they're talking about.

30
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:19,710
Rym: Like "uat," what?

31
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,489
Scott: I know people who worked for MySQL saying MySQL, so...

32
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:25,700
Rym: I know, I know.

33
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,407
Scott: They're wrong.

34
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:29,362
Rym: I mean, it's technically

35
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:29,664
Rym: "jif.".

36
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:30,988
Rym: It is.

37
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:34,510
Rym: I pretty much assume that anyone who says "jif" is either trolling or actually dumb.

38
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,200
Scott: Or the guy who invented

39
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:35,424
Scott: "jif."

40
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:38,470
Scott: Or they're talking about peanut butter.

41
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:40,336
Rym: That's

42
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:40,459
Rym: "jiffy.".

43
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:42,404
Scott: No, there's peanut butter.

44
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:42,747
Scott: that's just

45
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:42,909
Scott: "jif."

46
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,374
Scott: There is?

47
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,690
Rym: Or it's like a knockoff?

48
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,999
Scott: It's a brand of peanut butter.

49
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,201
Scott: It's

50
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:46,543
Scott: "jif."

51
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:47,430
Scott: That's the brand.

52
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:48,910
Rym: I don't really eat peanut butter.

53
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:50,360
Scott: It's really good.

54
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:50,869
Scott: You should eat it.

55
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,370
Rym: Also, the times I have eaten peanut butter...

56
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,090
Scott: You get ants on a log, you get a celery, you put peanut butter on it, and you put raisins in the peanut butter.

57
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,110
Scott: There's only one acceptable... Oh, you don't like raisins either.

58
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:00,559
Rym: I like raisins.

59
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,606
Rym: I don't like raisins as a snack.

60
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,530
Rym: A bowl of raisins is not appetizing to me.

61
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,183
Scott: You don't want any ants on a log?

62
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:05,530
Scott: Because you suck.

63
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:08,169
Rym: Ants on a log is kind of a lame snack.

64
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:08,668
Scott: You suck.

65
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:09,946
Rym: I much prefer the...

66
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,430
Scott: I'm gonna make some ants on a log when you get home.

67
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,010
Rym: See, peanut butter-filled celery is good.

68
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:13,528
Rym: No ass.

69
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,219
Rym: But...

70
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:15,550
Scott: Oh, see, because you're a raisin hater.

71
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:21,210
Rym: But it's gotta be, racist... It's gotta be crunchy, chunky peanut butter.

72
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:22,189
Rym: Or go home.

73
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,050
Scott: All peanut butter is good peanut butter.

74
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:25,322
Scott: Except for Peter Pan.

75
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:25,850
Scott: That shit sucks.

76
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:27,990
Rym: As a little kid, I used to like peanut butter toast.

77
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:29,389
Rym: I don't know if that's a thing.

78
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:36,988
Rym: Basically, what you do is you make some toast, and then you put some butter on it, and then you put some peanut butter on it.

79
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:37,906
Rym: And that's it.

80
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:38,766
Scott: Okay.

81
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,609
Rym: It's really good.

82
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:40,957
Scott: Butter is good.

83
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:41,684
Scott: Peanut butter is good.

84
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:42,250
Scott: Bread is good.

85
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:42,462
Rym: Yeah.

86
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,090
Scott: Fire is good.

87
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,976
Rym: It's way filling.

88
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:48,064
Rym: I feel like if I ate that in my modern adult life, my body would be like, "Oh, hell

89
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:48,267
Rym: no!".

90
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,590
Scott: That shit needs some bananas.

91
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:51,695
Scott: Mmm.

92
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:52,709
Scott: Sugar.

93
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:54,465
Rym: I don't know about sugar.

94
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:54,790
Rym: That's too much.

95
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,509
Scott: There's sugar in the banana.

96
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:57,289
Rym: But you don't want extra sugar.

97
00:02:57,472 --> 00:02:58,468
Rym: You don't want just banana sugar.

98
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,249
Scott: All sugar is good sugar.

99
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:00,970
Scott: All sugar?

100
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,169
Scott: Sugar plus butter is the best.

101
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,652
Rym: Yup.

102
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:05,350
Rym: Butter dip butter with a glaze.

103
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,530
Rym: A sous-son of sugar.

104
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:10,930
Rym: I think bacon is kind of hipster overplayed at this point.

105
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:13,666
Scott: I'll eat it.

106
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:16,190
Scott: Bacon plus butter plus sugar.

107
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,290
Rym: Bacon butter sugar.

108
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:17,826
Scott: Brown sugar.

109
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:19,734
Rym: So yeah.

110
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:20,930
Rym: I was skiing the other weekend.

111
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,443
Rym: I've been skiing every weekend for a while now, and I gotta say...

112
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,288
Scott: Not dead yet?

113
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:28,190
Rym: Kinda leveled up to the point that I gotta fly somewhere now.

114
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,008
Rym: I got bored.

115
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,448
Scott: Go fly to wherever Michael Schumacher was.

116
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:32,869
Scott: Might as well hurry it up.

117
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:39,228
Rym: What I think I might do is... I'm gonna try to get another business trip to Omaha and then...

118
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:40,089
Scott: Skiing in Omaha?

119
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:40,774
Rym: Well, no.

120
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:44,910
Rym: Just after my trip in Omaha, I'll stop in Colorado for like three days and then come home.

121
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,930
Scott: Isn't Colorado beyond Omaha?

122
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,390
Rym: Yes, but flying from Omaha... That's not the way back.

123
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:56,470
Rym: So flying from Omaha to Colorado is much shorter than flying from here to Colorado, and I'm already over there anyway.

124
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,510
Scott: But you'll have to fly from Colorado to here, which is long.

125
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,261
Rym: Yeah.

126
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:07,669
Rym: But the point is that the flights, other than my flight to Colorado, everything would be covered by my company.

127
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,590
Rym: And I would save the time because I'm already fucking over there.

128
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,350
Scott: They're gonna pay for your ski lodge, hotel, and lift ticket in Colorado?

129
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,288
Rym: No, I'll pay for that.

130
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:17,470
Scott: So I thought everything was covered by them.

131
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,709
Rym: Well, for the business trip part.

132
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,329
Scott: Okay.

133
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,490
Rym: The travel part is covered.

134
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,630
Scott: Why don't you just do business in Colorado?

135
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:26,150
Rym: There's really no business to be done in Colorado that I can find.

136
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:27,990
Rym: I've tried to do that.

137
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,564
Rym: I've tried to connive the business trip.

138
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,650
Rym: that is somewhere cool, but usually that's really hard.

139
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,168
Rym: I mean, Turkey's easy, but like...

140
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,150
Scott: How about the West Indies?

141
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:39,250
Rym: Uh, you've never been to the West Indies.

142
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:39,719
Scott: I haven't.

143
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:40,269
Scott: That's long ago.

144
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:45,330
Rym: But yeah, I have one thing to say about skiing.

145
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:47,830
Rym: Not saying snowboarding is a bad sport.

146
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:48,809
Rym: I think it's really cool.

147
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,109
Rym: I have nothing against it.

148
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,910
Rym: I think it is a skill-based and awesome activity equal to skiing, but different.

149
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:04,750
Rym: However, I'm just not allowed to say that nine times out of ten, if someone's doing something shitty at a mountain, it's a snowboarder and not a skier.

150
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:06,609
Rym: Just putting that observation out there.

151
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,990
Scott: Well, I think the problem is simply, it's nothing to do with snowboarding, right?

152
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:24,422
Scott: It's simply that mountains of ski that are used for skiing and snowboarding are populated mostly by people who want to snowboard, but don't actually snowboard, and instead get wasted and high and sit on the mountain.

153
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:32,510
Rym: Even if they're not good at skiing, I see skiers show up, do one run, and then take their skis off and just sit in the lodge for the rest of the day.

154
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,630
Rym: But the snowboarders will not get off the lift.

155
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,467
Rym: They'll get off the lift and just sit right down, and then the next lift comes up and people trip over them.

156
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:42,270
Rym: They just hang out at the bottom of the lift.

157
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:42,790
Rym: Nothing.

158
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,149
Scott: I would just step on them.

159
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,830
Rym: Yeah, they'll stop in the middle of a run.

160
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,490
Rym: I was skiing down a pretty fucking steep run, and there's this big sort of snow dune.

161
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:59,988
Rym: So I come up over the top of it, and I'm about to come down the other side at very high speed, and there's these two fucking snowboarders sitting there drinking beer.

162
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,370
Scott: Just sitting in the middle of the slope?

163
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,270
Rym: Yes, I literally almost hit them.

164
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,250
Rym: It took all of my skill to ski around.

165
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,289
Scott: Why wouldn't you just hit them?

166
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:10,389
Rym: Because that would have hurt me as much as it would have hurt them.

167
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:11,350
Scott: I don't know.

168
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,890
Scott: If one guy's impaled by a ski, and you're just sort of laying in the snow, who's hurt?

169
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,789
Rym: Yeah, the thing is, so here's an example.

170
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,927
Rym: This slope, I actually fell another time on a similar snow dune, like in that same area.

171
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,529
Rym: I came over the top of one.

172
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:30,008
Rym: It was solid ice on the other side, but I hit on my side, like parallel, because I wanted to go across it.

173
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,970
Rym: But then it turned out that there wasn't snow there like everywhere else in the mountain.

174
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:42,089
Rym: There was a thin layer of fake snow, and it was basically solid ice, and I just slid on my edge so fast I could not stop myself even with full edging.

175
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:43,669
Scott: Skiing's totally safe.

176
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:45,729
Rym: It was totally fun.

177
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,047
Rym: I'm not saying it's totally safe.

178
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:49,489
Scott: You said it many times.

179
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:52,430
Rym: It's more safe than driving, I would say.

180
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:52,915
Scott: Okay, sure.

181
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:56,270
Rym: I survived, didn't hurt myself.

182
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,030
Scott: It's more safe than setting yourself on fire.

183
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,310
Scott: I've driven and not survived.

184
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:05,370
Rym: I'll bet the odds of you dying in a bike accident are higher than the odds of me dying in a ski accident.

185
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,029
Scott: All right, we'll see who gets hurt first.

186
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:08,789
Rym: All right, you're on.

187
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:13,829
Rym: You know, this is going to end with me getting a Zipcar and ramming you on your way to work on your bike.

188
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,570
Scott: So, news is, this news isn't that exciting, but I just thought it was interesting.

189
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:33,090
Scott: So, Stratasys, which is a company that makes 3D printers, announced that they have made the first multi-color, multi-material 3D printer.

190
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:34,549
Rym: Oh, I saw that thing.

191
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,770
Scott: It's sort of obvious idea, right?

192
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:43,950
Scott: The way a printer works is that there's some sort of head that squirts material, be it ink or melted plastic, right?

193
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:50,950
Scott: And it moves around, and it squirts, and it builds either images on paper or physical objects with this method, right?

194
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:52,610
Scott: It would be sort of obvious.

195
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,210
Scott: We already have color printers, and the way they work is they have multiple heads that squirt different colors.

196
00:07:57,773 --> 00:08:10,728
Scott: So, you would make a 3D printer that had multiple heads and squirted different materials and colors with the different heads, thus to build a multi-material, multi-colored object in one print go instead of building separate objects and then sticking them together with glue at the end.

197
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:23,367
Scott: Or obvious idea, but no one had done it until now, apparently, because it's really not that simple to do with actual physical materials in a 3D printer the way it's simple to do with, you know, ink.

198
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:26,409
Rym: Yeah, because you're not building layers of stuff.

199
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:33,530
Scott: I mean, look how long it took to even get ink from, you know, dot matrix up to color desk jet and then laser color, right?

200
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:37,409
Rym: Yeah, I mean, when I was a kid, you couldn't just print to a piece of paper.

201
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,409
Rym: You had to print to this ugly-ass ribbon paper.

202
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:39,890
Scott: That's right.

203
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:48,609
Scott: So, you know, we have finally reached this point, which is sort of the obvious development, but no one could quite pull it off into a product that could be sold, and here it is.

204
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:51,472
Scott: It's only $330,000.

205
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:59,115
Scott: I say give it, eh, three to five years before you can buy one of these for your house, and it's reasonable, like $1,000 to $2,000.

206
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:00,150
Scott: And then it'll be pretty awesome.

207
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:00,652
Rym: Yeah.

208
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:01,444
Rym: Well, I mean...

209
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,929
Scott: Also, it's also a thing that makes me really like this is all the examples they have.

210
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,830
Scott: They're printing out multicolored bike helmets.

211
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:08,491
Rym: Ha!

212
00:09:08,994 --> 00:09:13,050
Rym: Well, we've said this many, many times, so I'll just say it again briefly.

213
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,469
Rym: This technology, you know, milestones like this have been coming along pretty rapidly for a few years now.

214
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:24,128
Rym: 3D printing technology is moving way faster than the vast majority of humans think it is.

215
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:30,490
Scott: Yeah, it's like the things like we're hoping for, like brain into cyberspace, it's like we're not seeing much movement there.

216
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,142
Scott: All the movement...

217
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:31,637
Rym: We are.

218
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,750
Scott: All the real movement's happening in 3D printing right now.

219
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:37,790
Scott: We're gonna get to "Diamond Age" before we get to neuromancing.

220
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,849
Rym: Yeah, I just want to get to culture.

221
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,389
Scott: At the current rate, it's gonna be "Diamond Age" first, so...

222
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:43,510
Rym: My goal is just culture.

223
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,909
Scott: If you have to read some cyberpunk novels, "Diamond Age" is the first one to go to if you're worried about what's gonna happen soon.

224
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:52,345
Rym: Either that or just watch "Ghost in the

225
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:52,567
Rym: Shell.".

226
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:57,988
Scott: Yeah, but "Ghost in the Shell" is, you know, we're gonna have -- I'm saying, "Diamond Age" will come before "Ghost in the

227
00:09:58,009 --> 00:09:58,110
Scott: Shell.".

228
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,590
Rym: I don't know, 'cause I point out that everything in "Ghost in the Shell" socially is happening except for the cyberbrains.

229
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,710
Rym: Like, we're doing all those things without cyberbrains.

230
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,490
Scott: But "Ghost in the Shell" doesn't have the 3D printing, which we are gonna have.

231
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:09,869
Rym: I know.

232
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:10,629
Scott: And we do have.

233
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:19,469
Rym: So we'll have the social "Ghost in the Shell" with the material "Diamond Age," but we won't have the far extremes of the other parts of the technology in the two.

234
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,570
Scott: We do need to make -- and maybe that's something that needs to be made -- the cyberpunk story that has both.

235
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:25,110
Rym: Uh, culture.

236
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:25,941
Scott: Sure.

237
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,449
Rym: You realize the problem with culture is that -- Yeah, because they don't need it.

238
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,009
Rym: They have it, and no one gives a shit.

239
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:33,710
Scott: That's right.

240
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:38,309
Rym: They're at the point where people will be like, "Yeah, I don't do simulation,".

241
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,110
Rym: 'cause there's literally no difference between simulation and reality.

242
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:46,848
Rym: Like, there's no such thing as "hacking" in the traditional sense.

243
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:51,330
Scott: You don't have to wait for the orbital to be built in the simulation.

244
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:52,049
Scott: It just is.

245
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:58,710
Rym: Yeah, if you don't want to wait for the orbital to be built, just stop your mind, save it in a substrate, and then get woken up when it's built.

246
00:10:58,872 --> 00:11:00,048
Rym: Literally no time went by.

247
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,467
Rym: Yeah, culture books are really great, and I'm almost out of them.

248
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:07,544
Scott: Well, that's sad.

249
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,829
Rym: So I got another actually really cool news that you guys might not have been paying attention to.

250
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:21,688
Rym: So if you weren't aware, polio's not really an issue in the Western world, but still an issue in other parts of the world, even to this day.

251
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,110
Rym: But there's a big milestone.

252
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:32,910
Rym: India finally, after a long, long and hard battle, is on the verge of officially having eradicated polio.

253
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:37,068
Scott: Even in the places where, like, it's totally rural and there isn't really...

254
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:50,910
Rym: The numbers of cases in recent years were numbering in the hundreds, and now they're at the point to where some of the last work to do is to secure and/or destroy the samples of polio they have in labs because they've done such a good job of fighting polio.

255
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,770
Scott: Not to rain on a parade, but is this because maybe in the rural places they just infanticide babies with polio?

256
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,710
Rym: Uh, no, actually.

257
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,270
Rym: It's mostly due to the fact that they forced children to get immunizations.

258
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,508
Scott: That is a good news.

259
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:04,229
Rym: In fact...

260
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,990
Scott: And I have not found any badness in this news with my cynical powers.

261
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,630
Rym: They did it really obviously.

262
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:24,744
Rym: They got people together, they paid whatever needed to be paid to make this happen, and they had people at the border, even undocumented illegal refugees, whoever you were, if you had any kids, they'd be like, "Your kid's getting this vaccine," and then, "We're not gonna ask you any other questions or bother you in any other

263
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:24,907
Rym: way.".

264
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:26,127
Scott: Otherwise you can't come in.

265
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:26,690
Rym: Yeah.

266
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,530
Scott: Or they're gonna stab you with this needle, and then you can come in.

267
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,470
Rym: No, not even stab.

268
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,810
Rym: So they took the broad approach.

269
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:36,929
Rym: They used the other methods, like the nose spray and the other things.

270
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:37,647
Scott: Do they work?

271
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:38,609
Scott: I guess they must work.

272
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,709
Rym: They work almost as well.

273
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:59,770
Rym: So now that they've basically eradicated polio, by using that as this broad brush, they're using the more effective and safer injections to have another generation of kids with one higher level of immunity, and basically, India has solved this problem that has ravaged the entire world for a long time.

274
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,350
Rym: I mean, FDR had polio, guys.

275
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:03,690
Rym: That's why he was in a wheelchair.

276
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,570
Scott: He was in a wheelchair?

277
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:05,968
Rym: Yeah.

278
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,177
Rym: Actually, the U.S.

279
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:21,048
Rym: hid the fact that he was in a wheelchair to the point that, when he came to New York, he had a special train car that would be detached under Grand Central and had a special way for him to drive a car out of that train car into an elevator and go up into the hotel without anyone seeing him.

280
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:31,430
Rym: In that era, most people did not know that FDR needed a wheelchair because it was thought that it would damage the war effort to see him from a position of weakness.

281
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:33,607
Rym: That was a long time ago.

282
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:40,530
Rym: So if you think vaccines are bullshit, or you're one of those McCarthy-type people, you're a terrible person.

283
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:41,490
Rym: You should read this article.

284
00:13:42,670 --> 00:14:00,970
Rym: Also, for everyone else, this is kind of an example of how we talk a lot about the far, far edges of technology -- the 3-D printing, the cyberspace -- and that stuff's all coming, but the very simple and basic application of existing technology can do more good for the world than anything on the cutting edge right now.

285
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:25,610
Scott: Yeah, I mean, the things that we're talking about have, you know, like, basic technologies that we enjoy every day have still not been deployed everywhere in the world, and that can do -- that can achieve more progress more easily than developing new whatevers -- It's like, yeah, if we would just fucking get fast Internet like they have in, say, Korea to everywhere in the world, it's an invention we've already invented.

286
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,786
Scott: We just had to deploy it.

287
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,461
Scott: The U.S.

288
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:29,350
Scott: doesn't even have that shit.

289
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,410
Scott: Canada doesn't even have what we have, right?

290
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,270
Rym: Yeah, or imagine if everyone in the world had access to clean water.

291
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,010
Rym: That would solve a lot of other problems.

292
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,692
Scott: Clean water?

293
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:38,270
Scott: We've had that technology for a long time.

294
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:43,150
Scott: Why don't we deploy that shit every single place people live, where there is water?

295
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,930
Rym: The problem is we keep deploying the shit.

296
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,729
Rym: We have to not deploy the shit and deploy the shit removal systems.

297
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:56,250
Rym: So, yeah, this is a long and detailed article about how India got rid of polio.

298
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:56,714
Rym: Mm-hmm.

299
00:14:57,672 --> 00:15:04,370
Rym: And you should really think about this because the United States went through this battle not that long ago.

300
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,009
Rym: There are people alive today who remember when people got polio in the U.S.

301
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:08,620
Rym: Mm-hmm.

302
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,740
Rym: So things of the day.

303
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:23,099
Rym: You're all familiar with the fact that YouTube comments are -- They're not the literal bottom of the Internet because that's space dicks, but they're -- They're bad.

304
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,500
Rym: They're the bottom of the Internet that you can even see, like, below YouTube comments.

305
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,838
Scott: They're the worst Internet in the place that you actually go to.

306
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,691
Scott: See, it's like the worst Internet that you actually encounter normally that you can't really get away from.

307
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,760
Scott: Because you're gonna go to YouTube.

308
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:46,900
Rym: If you go to a city like Detroit and go to a really, really bad neighborhood and go to, like, the worst alley in that bad neighborhood, that's YouTube comments.

309
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:50,380
Rym: The only way to get worse is to go inside of a private crack house.

310
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,420
Scott: Right, but here's the thing, is that usually you don't go to those neighborhoods, right?

311
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,399
Scott: You don't go to space dicks.

312
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:59,714
Scott: But YouTube comments is like, "You're just walking down the street going to your regular old grocery store, and --".

313
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,135
Rym: You're like, "What's in that

314
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:01,360
Rym: alley?".

315
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,276
Scott: "And a guy from the really bad neighborhood walks into the grocery

316
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:04,540
Scott: store.".

317
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:05,680
Scott: That is YouTube comments.

318
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,515
Scott: And that's why there is such a problem, right, as opposed to if that guy stayed in his neighborhood in his space.

319
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,539
Scott: dicks, people wouldn't hate on it so much.

320
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:17,860
Rym: So this is a video, and these guys did an entire series of these.

321
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,860
Rym: So if you enjoy this, just click on that channel, Dead Parrot, and watch everything they got.

322
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,540
Scott: They're all brilliant.

323
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,259
Scott: Dead Parrot, you say?

324
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:25,620
Rym: Hell, yes.

325
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,880
Rym: So this is what they do.

326
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,780
Scott: It's not dead, I don't think.

327
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:30,139
Rym: They have actors.

328
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,840
Scott: They still had new videos uploaded.

329
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,678
Scott: They're not dead yet.

330
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:34,219
Rym: It's getting better.

331
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:35,759
Rym: He's pining for the fjords.

332
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,897
Rym: He's not pining, he's passed on.

333
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:41,680
Rym: All right, let's not quote the entire --.

334
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:51,617
Rym: I feel like nerds who were born in a certain era can start quoting Monty Python verbatim and not stop until an entire movie or scene is acted out.

335
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,285
Scott: So -- Neat.

336
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,557
Rym: Peng.

337
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:56,393
Rym: Neewum.

338
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,455
Scott: All right.

339
00:16:58,108 --> 00:16:58,537
Scott: I concur.

340
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:08,800
Rym: So this is a reconstruction of a YouTube discussion between two people on the video of Nelson Mandela's funeral.

341
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:13,980
Rym: You can go look at the actual conversation that they are reenacting.

342
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,979
Rym: This is beautiful to behold.

343
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:16,855
Scott: All right.

344
00:17:17,848 --> 00:17:18,138
Scott: Is that it?

345
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,473
Scott: That's it.

346
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:32,160
Scott: Okay, so we've been reading, if you haven't been paying attention, there's been a lot of stories recently in the past few months or so about how most of the olive oil you get is not olive oil, right?

347
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:48,280
Scott: Apparently, what happens -- We might have talked about this in the show before, but a lot of the olive oils in the grocery store are, like, not 100% olive oil, and it's like they'll import other oils to Italy, combine them with olive oil, and then send them out, right?

348
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:57,299
Scott: So, you know, it's like now that that's been exposed to people who care, the only question we really want answered is, "Well, what the fuck olive oil do I buy?

349
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,894
Scott: that's actually goddamn olive

350
00:17:59,035 --> 00:17:59,136
Scott: oil?"

351
00:17:59,540 --> 00:17:59,654
Scott: Right?

352
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:02,339
Scott: So here's the answer.

353
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,219
Scott: Thing of the day.

354
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,400
Scott: Tom's -- I guess it's truth in olive oil.

355
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,720
Scott: Tom's Supermarket Picks.

356
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,459
Scott: Quality oils at good prices.

357
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,920
Scott: This guy went to a bunch of supermarkets.

358
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:15,837
Scott: He got olive oils, and he said, "Which ones are legit and which ones are not

359
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:16,200
Scott: legit?".

360
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,253
Rym: How did he determine that?

361
00:18:17,334 --> 00:18:17,800
Rym: Did he test?

362
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,320
Scott: He is an olive oil expert person.

363
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,400
Rym: How do you know he's not a scam?

364
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,790
Rym: How do you know he's not in the pocket of Big Olive?

365
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:33,579
Scott: Because he's mentioned a whole bunch of different olive oils everywhere, and none -- Yeah, maybe the olive lobby has got him in their pocket.

366
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:38,660
Scott: I trust anyone who says they went to Trader Joe's and only three out of the six were the real deal.

367
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,057
Rym: Maybe Trader Joe's didn't pay up.

368
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:43,252
Rym: Too big oil.

369
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:44,699
Scott: It paid -- I don't know.

370
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:46,360
Scott: All right, fine.

371
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,380
Rym: Maybe he did not worship at the altar of olive oil.

372
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,600
Scott: If this page is an olive oil conspiracy, well, you're just fucked.

373
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,097
Scott: You're not gonna get real olive oil anyway.

374
00:18:55,642 --> 00:19:02,520
Scott: But at least the next time I go to go buy some oil, I'm either A, gonna buy the cheapest goddamn oil they have, and if it's fake, who gives a shit?

375
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,539
Scott: I'm buying the cheapest oil.

376
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
Scott: Or B, buy the olive oil on this list.

377
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,100
Scott: Plus, I think I also learned you sort of need two olive oils.

378
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,200
Rym: Yeah, exactly what I was about to say.

379
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,798
Rym: You need extra virgin olive oil -- You got to get the olive oil -- -- for dipping things into.

380
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,097
Scott: Right, for dipping your breads.

381
00:19:15,462 --> 00:19:17,920
Scott: And then you got to get the oil, the cheapo one for cooking.

382
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:18,493
Rym: Yep.

383
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,900
Rym: It's still olive oil, but you don't want that strong-ass olive flavor.

384
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,275
Scott: That's right.

385
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,398
Scott: You got to get two different oils.

386
00:19:24,682 --> 00:19:28,240
Scott: So, in the meta moment -- Oh, and you use the one for dipping also for salad dressing.

387
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:28,536
Rym: Yep.

388
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,220
Rym: The meta moment, the book club book was -- "I Do Do" by William Gibson.

389
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:33,999
Rym: It was pretty good.

390
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:34,737
Rym: We both read it.

391
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:36,759
Rym: We're gonna do a show on it as soon as we can.

392
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:37,298
Scott: Thursday?

393
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,013
Rym: Yep.

394
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,080
Rym: Next Thursday.

395
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,519
Scott: Next Thursday?

396
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:48,180
Rym: The next book will be, I finally decided, "Wool" by Hugh Howery, because I was given a copy of this book by a listener.

397
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:53,020
Rym: I was given another copy of this book that was signed by the author by someone.

398
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:58,879
Rym: I got a copy of this book in the goodie bag at that PAX charity dinner that we went to.

399
00:19:59,243 --> 00:19:59,978
Scott: I have one of those, too.

400
00:20:00,322 --> 00:20:03,040
Rym: The CTO of my company was like, "Hey, you read a bunch of sci-fi.

401
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,436
Rym: I just read the most amazing

402
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:04,659
Rym: book.".

403
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:05,531
Rym: And it ended up being

404
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:05,754
Rym: "Wool.".

405
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:07,820
Rym: The universe is telling me to read this.

406
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,098
Rym: People are losing their shit over it.

407
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:16,439
Scott: And I gotta say -- It might be -- I mean, it wasn't quite that intense, but I had a similar thing with "Name of the Wind," and look how that turned out.

408
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:28,500
Rym: I was about to say, a similar thing happened with "The Kingkiller Chronicle," and it turned out that "The Kingkiller Chronicle" is Captain Nice Guy's penis adventures through the sex lands of fedora world.

409
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,279
Rym: And, yeah, I'm hoping either this book will live up, which will be -- That's a win, if it lives up.

410
00:20:35,421 --> 00:20:36,980
Scott: Or so bad our episode is so good.

411
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,878
Rym: If I get to piss all over your parade, that is equally valuable to me.

412
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:45,350
Scott: Oh, what else do we got?

413
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,949
Scott: I hope they're not pulling the wool over our eyes on this one.

414
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,130
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX East.

415
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,449
Rym: We're gonna be at Zenkai Con.

416
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:51,074
Scott: What?

417
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:51,428
Scott: Why?

418
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,869
Scott: We're gonna be at Anime Boston.

419
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:53,987
Scott: Okay, we can go there.

420
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,130
Rym: We're gonna be at ConnectiCon.

421
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,210
Rym: We're scheduling panels for ConnectiCon currently.

422
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:00,050
Rym: We're gonna be at PAX Prime.

423
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,070
Rym: We're gonna be at MAGFest.

424
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:04,330
Scott: I'm gonna be at PAX Australia.

425
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,730
Rym: Scott is probably not going to be at PAX Australia.

426
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,868
Scott: Someone want to pay for it?

427
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,889
Rym: Yeah, we might get someone to pay for it.

428
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:11,789
Scott: Send me some monies.

429
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,226
Rym: Maybe we'll do a Kickstarter of "Bring Scott Along to

430
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:14,690
Rym: Australia.".

431
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,530
Scott: I don't need enough monies just for the plane ticket.

432
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,730
Scott: I also need monies to make up for my unpaid vacation days.

433
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:20,157
Scott: Nah.

434
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,070
Rym: What if you covered half of it?

435
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:22,950
Rym: 'Cause it's gonna be summer.

436
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,009
Rym: You can go to the reefs.

437
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:24,927
Scott: I know.

438
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:27,010
Rym: That's part of the reason why I really want to go.

439
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,970
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much the only place I want to go.

440
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:29,381
Scott: Yeah.

441
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:37,890
Scott: I just don't want to -- You know, it's like, I want to go to every PAX, and I want to go to see the coral reef, but I feel bad going to the same country twice.

442
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,908
Scott: I haven't even been to Europe once.

443
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,429
Scott: I got to go to Europe.

444
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:44,090
Rym: My plan is to go to Australia for PAX.

445
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:51,169
Scott: The thing is, I want a convention to go to in Europe, but there's no PAX there, and all the conventions they have there, as far as I can tell, are just like land parties, besides Essen.

446
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,210
Rym: So, Scott, I'm planning to spend like three weeks.

447
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:58,890
Rym: My plan is to do PAX and then do work stuff, like basically go to Sydney and all these cities doing work stuff.

448
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:03,069
Rym: I kind of want to book enough days off to bike from Melbourne to Sydney.

449
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:05,790
Scott: I guess in the summer you can do that.

450
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:07,389
Scott: Well, we learned you can just bike on the freeway.

451
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,789
Scott: Yeah, just pass all those farms.

452
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,290
Rym: Yeah, but I mean, we saw there's bike lanes on the goddamn freeways there.

453
00:22:12,455 --> 00:22:12,709
Rym: I know.

454
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:14,189
Rym: I'm really excited about that.

455
00:22:14,494 --> 00:22:15,070
Rym: I looked online.

456
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:16,710
Rym: People have biked from Melbourne to Sydney.

457
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:28,530
Rym: It's not out of the realm for someone of my ability, and then I want to go up to the reefs and then go home, or maybe I'll stop somewhere in that region on my way home.

458
00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:34,668
Scott: I think this year I'm going to spend my monies on just getting a new bike and maybe that camera if it comes out.

459
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,570
Rym: Ah, you should probably get that camera.

460
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,447
Scott: That rumored 4K.

461
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:39,630
Rym: Yeah.

462
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:40,090
Scott: We'll see.

463
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,090
Rym: So people can really see our pores when we do GeekNights Presents.

464
00:22:44,552 --> 00:22:45,549
Scott: And our Netrunner cards.

465
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,690
Rym: So yeah, tons of videos of our shit around the internet.

466
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:50,050
Rym: Spread them around.

467
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,910
Rym: The more you spread them, the more views they get, the quicker we make more.

468
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:59,409
Rym: We have created more episodes of GeekNights Presents, and as soon as I can get my ass down to editing them.

469
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,409
Scott: You mean one episode?

470
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:03,469
Rym: One is a number.

471
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:05,290
Scott: You said episodes.

472
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:05,820
Scott: Yes.

473
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:06,850
Scott: It's not.

474
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,110
Scott: We even created one episode.

475
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,810
Rym: Well, I'm trying to think of how I could stretch that into episode.

476
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:17,210
Rym: I could release it as two episodes like we did with that one Nanami thing.

477
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,309
Scott: That you should not do.

478
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,946
Rym: I could release episode 10 and then episode 10A.

479
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:22,369
Scott: Do not do that.

480
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:23,729
Rym: But I did that once.

481
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,829
Rym: We had the choo-choo aside.

482
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,990
Scott: Well, there's no asides in this one.

483
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,930
Rym: I could do an aside of just the shadow girls.

484
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:40,789
Rym: I could add audio explaining that it might have been a metaphor for that time when Chiyo Saito, or when Ikahara went to Chiyo Saito supposedly and said, "Hey, what color should the dress be?

485
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:42,066
Rym: This one or this

486
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:42,269
Rym: one?".

487
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,747
Rym: And Chiyo Saito was like, "That

488
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:43,990
Rym: one.".

489
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:46,209
Rym: He was like, "Okay," and then did the opposite of what she said.

490
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,190
Scott: According to an America.

491
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,730
Rym: Yes, according to an America.

492
00:23:51,352 --> 00:23:52,028
Rym: I digress.

493
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:54,521
Rym: Join our forum.

494
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:55,089
Rym: It's awesome.

495
00:23:57,053 --> 00:24:01,303
Rym: So, you might be thinking to yourself, you kids out there, "Why are Rym and Scott doing a show on

496
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:01,908
Rym: USB?".

497
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,068
Scott: Because Rym wanted to.

498
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,809
Rym: There's so little to say.

499
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,109
Rym: I plug it in and it just works.

500
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,130
Rym: And that's kind of true.

501
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:27,389
Rym: But at the same time, the reason I want to do this show, you'll see I sort of have a point here at the end, a moral to all this, is that randomly over the last few months, I had multiple people who are technological in some fashion incorrectly correct me on a matter of USB.

502
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,028
Rym: Multiple occasions came up where someone had some question like, "I want to plug my thing into my cell

503
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:33,230
Rym: phone.".

504
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,349
Rym: I'd say, "Oh, you need a micro B or a mini

505
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:36,450
Rym: B.".

506
00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:39,370
Rym: And then they'd be like, "Oh, blah, blah, blah.

507
00:24:39,431 --> 00:24:39,802
Rym: What's this

508
00:24:39,864 --> 00:24:40,029
Rym: thing?".

509
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,741
Rym: And I was like, "Oh, that's

510
00:24:40,964 --> 00:24:40,984
Rym: A.".

511
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:44,401
Rym: And then they'd say, "No, I think that's B. I think you're

512
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:44,849
Rym: wrong.".

513
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:46,950
Rym: And they just didn't know what they were talking about.

514
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:50,810
Rym: And enough people were wrong about USB in the same way.

515
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,969
Rym: I don't know if someone just wrote some documentation incorrectly somewhere.

516
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:05,009
Rym: I don't know if someone fucked up somewhere and a lot of people don't know how USB works and in fact know it the opposite way from how it should be.

517
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:15,750
Rym: So what I want to explain is how USB works from the functional level, like the parts that matter to you as a technologist.

518
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:19,070
Scott: Well, I mean, first you got to understand the history of USB, right?

519
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:27,708
Scott: Back in the day, as late as the late '90s, when you wanted to plug something into your computer, there were a hundred different kinds of things you could plug in.

520
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,130
Scott: And we're just talking about the outside.

521
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:29,809
Rym: No inside shit.

522
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,130
Scott: We're talking external cables.

523
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,190
Scott: You had PS/2 cables.

524
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:35,727
Rym: You had parallel cables, serial ports.

525
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,650
Rym: Most computers did not have parallel ports.

526
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,509
Scott: We had parallel ports.

527
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:48,970
Rym: Yeah, usually you had to buy a card that was often a combination parallel port card, sound card.

528
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,329
Scott: Well, no, the sound card would have a game port on it, which I didn't meant, right?

529
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:57,670
Scott: And then there was SCSI on some computers, like RAM with the SCSI-ness.

530
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,530
Rym: I paid a lot of money for that fucking SCSI-ness.

531
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,867
Scott: Right, and that was just PCs.

532
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,369
Scott: Apple computers had a whole bunch of others, right?

533
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:11,450
Scott: And in those days also, when you connected hardware to a computer, you had to manually configure like the IRQ and whatnot.

534
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:13,390
Scott: So you had all these problems.

535
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:23,349
Scott: And what happened was is around the time that Windows 95, 98 came out, they solved the problem of detecting, automatically detecting what was plugged in.

536
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,550
Scott: So you didn't have to manually configure your shit.

537
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,185
Scott: It would just be like, "Oh, I see some hardware.

538
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:27,346
Scott: All

539
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:27,548
Scott: good.".

540
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:28,889
Rym: That was a big deal.

541
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,530
Scott: Right, it was called Plug and Play, right?

542
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,528
Scott: And it actually started to work.

543
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:38,149
Scott: And they could load the drivers for your hardware dynamically instead of you having to manually put them in.

544
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,949
Scott: So that allowed for the introduction of USB, the Universal Serial Bus.

545
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:49,990
Scott: They could replace pretty much almost all of those ports with one kind of port, the USB.

546
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,805
Scott: And the most important thing about USB is that you could plug and unplug something while the computer was on.

547
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,049
Scott: You didn't have to detect it when it turned on.

548
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:04,148
Scott: You used to have to like, if you want to plug something new into your computer, you'd have to turn your computer off, plug something in, turn the computer on.

549
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,329
Scott: Not USB, you don't do that shit.

550
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,438
Rym: Huge difference.

551
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:07,621
Rym: Huge.

552
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:08,740
Rym: So imagine this.

553
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:09,450
Rym: Here's an example.

554
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,529
Rym: In the old days, I was at a LAN party, right?

555
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:12,950
Rym: In Southfield.

556
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:14,490
Rym: And I went with a bunch of my friends.

557
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:16,650
Rym: We'd respect our giant fucking CRTs.

558
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,949
Rym: Everyone rode with a CRT in their lap.

559
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,910
Rym: We go to this LAN party, we hook everything up, we play.

560
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:26,189
Rym: In the middle of a tournament, I kicked my keyboard cable out.

561
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,209
Scott: You had to restart your computer.

562
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,250
Rym: I had to reboot my computer.

563
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:30,530
Rym: You can't just plug that shit back in.

564
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:30,928
Scott: That's right.

565
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,747
Rym: So all these methods were very, very simple.

566
00:27:37,373 --> 00:27:41,369
Rym: The way these ports worked was so simple that you would almost laugh at them today.

567
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:46,070
Rym: Serial ports had all these pins that had all these different functions.

568
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:52,489
Rym: You could make a circuit that would respond to a serial port out of resistors and a breadboard.

569
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,649
Rym: Like you, right now, could just do that.

570
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:55,790
Rym: It was so simple.

571
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,148
Rym: Maybe a big chip with a bunch of NAND gates on it to make it easier.

572
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,550
Rym: Parallel ports, in theory, were faster than serial ports.

573
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:04,029
Scott: In theory.

574
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,130
Rym: Because serial ports were serial.

575
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:09,710
Rym: They said one bit at a time.

576
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,210
Scott: Just like a serial TV show.

577
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,130
Scott: Things in order.

578
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:14,230
Scott: So USB is serial.

579
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:19,050
Scott: It sends one bit at a time, basically, but the bits come in so fast, one after the other.

580
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,190
Scott: A parallel port can send multiple bits simultaneously.

581
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,910
Scott: Like, here are eight bits, and they all arrive at the same exact moment.

582
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,479
Scott: So it's like having eight USB ports.

583
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,050
Scott: That should be eight times faster, right?

584
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,030
Scott: Right?

585
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:35,829
Rym: Well, it was until you started clocking up the speed.

586
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:43,030
Rym: Because it turns out that in all signaling, one, it actually takes time for the voltage.

587
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:47,950
Rym: Because remember, signals, as we talked about, god, like five years ago on GeekNights.

588
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,370
Rym: If you want to send a one, you have to agree mutually on both sides.

589
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:52,730
Rym: What is a one?

590
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:53,970
Scott: Five volts is a one.

591
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:54,490
Rym: Yes.

592
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,990
Rym: So your voltage changes to determine ones and zeros.

593
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,989
Rym: There's different encoding mechanisms for that.

594
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:05,850
Rym: But it takes time for the voltage to get to the threshold and then get to the other threshold.

595
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,629
Scott: It's like the voltage is at zero.

596
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:13,350
Scott: It goes up to five, which means it was at one at some point, and at two at some point, and at three at some point.

597
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:16,769
Scott: It's pretty fast when it switches up to five and down to zero again.

598
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:24,069
Scott: But it takes longer than zero seconds to get the voltage up and then bring it back down again.

599
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:30,130
Rym: So essentially, what happened was with parallel communication, the same thing happened with IDE and hard drives.

600
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,509
Rym: Parallel data transfers are very difficult to synchronize at high speed.

601
00:29:35,992 --> 00:29:41,170
Rym: All eight of those wires have to be sending at the exact same timing or the whole thing breaks down.

602
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:48,790
Scott: And by adding technology to keep that stuff synchronized, you're actually just -- that's time taking away from -- It increases complexity.

603
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,950
Rym: It increases cost.

604
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,110
Rym: It increases a lot of issues.

605
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:57,530
Scott: You could just send one bit at a time really, really fast and just forget about trying to synchronize anything.

606
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:03,630
Scott: Instead of using some hardware to synchronize stuff, that hardware can just send more bits faster and read more bits faster.

607
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:06,328
Rym: Remember the background in PETA, parallel ATA.

608
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,830
Rym: Hard drives used to connect with those ribbon cables.

609
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,390
Scott: That's right.

610
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:17,110
Rym: And then SATA stands for serial ATA, serial one bit at a time.

611
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,750
Scott: And notice how the cable is so much smaller because, yeah, it's only sending one bit at a time.

612
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,530
Scott: You don't need a million cables if you're only sending one at a time.

613
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:28,050
Scott: All those cables are all to send simultaneous bits on separate wires.

614
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,110
Scott: If you're only sending one wire has the bits on it, well, two technically.

615
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:35,650
Scott: Then the cables are much smaller for everything and easier to plug in.

616
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,230
Scott: and just everything is just better.

617
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,130
Rym: Now, you might be saying, but Black Dynamite, couldn't I send more than one bit at the same time over one cable?

618
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,510
Rym: Well, you sort of can, but then you have another level of complication.

619
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,109
Rym: For example, in radio signals, there's what?

620
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,730
Rym: QAM, quadratic amplitude modulation.

621
00:30:53,412 --> 00:30:56,210
Rym: This is getting back into like my freshman year of RIT stuff.

622
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:04,830
Rym: Basically, you could have an encoding mechanism that says something like, if I get up to five volts, it's one, it's zero zero.

623
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,470
Rym: But if I get up to ten volts plus ten, then it's zero one.

624
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,420
Rym: And you could come up with an encoding scheme.

625
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:12,290
Scott: Yep.

626
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:16,850
Rym: But now it takes longer to get to all those different voltage states.

627
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,690
Scott: Yeah, to go from zero to ten takes a long ass time.

628
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:26,730
Rym: And also you have to get to them reliably so that the other side understands, was that a one zero or a one one?

629
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:27,081
Rym: Yep.

630
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:32,230
Rym: And you have all the same problem, well, not the same problems, but the same order of problems that you get with a parallel cable.

631
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,050
Scott: Now you could.

632
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:39,850
Scott: Well, if we could just make serial cables so fast, why don't we just have ten serial cables hooked up to one hard drive?

633
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,149
Scott: And it's like, sure, you can do that.

634
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,270
Rym: Yeah, if you have an asynchronous way of getting at the data you want.

635
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,809
Scott: None of those will be synchronized.

636
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,630
Scott: One of them might be going slightly faster or slower than the other ones.

637
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:58,150
Scott: You need beyond on the other side of the cables, you need some kind of software or something working at a higher level to sort of resynchronize all the data and put it together.

638
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:04,750
Scott: It's like, you know, if one of the cables sends you like a hundred bits and the other one is only sent one bit, you need to keep that shit in line somewhere.

639
00:32:04,892 --> 00:32:06,087
Scott: And if you can do it, you can do it.

640
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,705
Rym: Now think about it, something like...

641
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:12,790
Scott: But then suddenly your CPU is doing this work, putting data back together instead of actually processing that data.

642
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:21,990
Rym: To use a far flung example, BitTorrent, against a bunch of stuff from a bunch of different sources and puts it together in one contiguous file, because you don't care about latency.

643
00:32:22,432 --> 00:32:22,542
Scott: Nope.

644
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,370
Rym: You can wait, you don't need it in real time.

645
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:30,550
Rym: It turns out with a mouse or a keyboard, latency matters a lot.

646
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:36,629
Rym: If you click and something doesn't immediately react, you're frustrated immediately, at least you should be.

647
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:44,430
Rym: And there's a separate discussion we can have about how I think UIs needs to be prioritized above literally everything else in a modern computer.

648
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,149
Rym: But I digress.

649
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:51,428
Rym: So, Windows 95 didn't even fucking support USB, because that's about when it came out.

650
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:53,110
Rym: Windows 95...

651
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,190
Scott: You had to get drivers to do it.

652
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,108
Rym: Windows 95, I think B supported it, but I never upgraded to B.

653
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:00,065
Scott: I only had B.

654
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,749
Rym: Yeah, I had A. I bought it, yeah.

655
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,510
Rym: Not getting into all that stuff.

656
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,270
Scott: I remember, I think I have the CD still, and it says with USB support on the disk.

657
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:15,430
Rym: So, USB got adopted, and it was actually a big deal when USB got adopted.

658
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:21,909
Scott: It was surprising, it came out, and some motherboards had it, other people had to buy cards to add USB ports.

659
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:27,310
Scott: But it was like when they started actually making hardware that used it, people were, you know, it's actually caught on.

660
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:38,170
Scott: And I think really what made it catch on is that almost all the people who had mice and keyboards started making USB mice and keyboards, and they always included in the package a USB to PS2 adapter.

661
00:33:38,492 --> 00:33:54,450
Scott: So, it's like because that was able to exist, the USB to PS2 adapter was such a simple and cheap device, that that's what allowed everyone to switch to making USB mice and keyboards just in throwing these adapters in the package, so that, you know, USB adoption actually happened, right?

662
00:33:54,550 --> 00:34:04,370
Scott: Otherwise, all the people who made mice and keyboards would have kept making PS2 mice and keyboards and USB mice and keyboards separately, and you wouldn't have had people all switching over as much as they did.

663
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:09,170
Rym: So, the way USB works, you don't care about the signaling.

664
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,924
Rym: Now, this is where I want to talk about the details, because I think a lot of people who think they're using USB 3 aren't.

665
00:34:16,531 --> 00:34:16,844
Rym: No kidding.

666
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:26,476
Rym: Because I went around showing a lot of people what USB 3 cables look like, and everyone I showed these to, without exception, said, "Whoa, what's that?

667
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,148
Rym: Some kind of proprietary USB

668
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:29,590
Rym: bullshit?".

669
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:32,030
Rym: I was like, "No, that's USB 3.

670
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,087
Rym: You clearly are not using it on any device you

671
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:34,309
Rym: own.".

672
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,295
Scott: I'm using it.

673
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:40,830
Scott: I have a USB 3 USB stick, and I have a USB 3 holes on my computer.

674
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:51,150
Rym: Now, the difference is that actually there's different numbers of pins, and there's different kinds of connectors, partly to allow for backward compatibility.

675
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,290
Rym: We'll get to that in a minute.

676
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,989
Rym: So, USB 2 is what most people use and know about.

677
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,070
Rym: That's the USB that was useful.

678
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:01,449
Scott: It's just faster than USB 1, pretty much.

679
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:06,590
Rym: The big revolution in USB was that, one, it was serial, which was better because it could extend.

680
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,250
Rym: It could get faster over time.

681
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,709
Scott: You could unplug and plug things in while the computer was on.

682
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:11,045
Rym: Yup.

683
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:12,270
Scott: Hot swapping.

684
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,590
Rym: And it could provide power to devices.

685
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,310
Scott: That is the super important thing.

686
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:25,169
Scott: It used to be when you had a serial cable or a parallel cable or any other kind of cable, you would have to -- PS/2 cables provided enough power to light those little lights.

687
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:30,309
Scott: Yeah, PS/2 provided enough power for your mouse and keyboard, but that's not enough power to actually do anything, right?

688
00:35:31,351 --> 00:35:39,850
Scott: If you couldn't charge an iPhone from a PS/2 port, if you bought a hard drive that used a serial cable, you had to plug that hard drive into the wall.

689
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:51,390
Scott: Even when I had a USB 56K modem, that modem had a separate thing to plug into the wall to get power and then a separate thing for the phone cable, right?

690
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,309
Scott: It didn't get all its power just from USB.

691
00:35:54,030 --> 00:36:04,209
Rym: So, kids, if you ever plugged your iPad into a USB port and it wouldn't charge, you didn't understand why, turns out the different versions of USB, as time went on, supported different amounts of power.

692
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:08,725
Rym: And there's actually a negotiation for, "Hey, device, how much power can you

693
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:09,169
Rym: handle?".

694
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:12,286
Rym: "Hey, computer, I can handle five amps.

695
00:36:12,446 --> 00:36:12,668
Rym: Let's

696
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:12,909
Rym: go.".

697
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,038
Scott: You can't have five amps.

698
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:19,050
Scott: Pretty much most USB today, almost every USB you're going to encounter is going to be one amp, right?

699
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,149
Scott: Which is enough to charge a lot of things.

700
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:26,510
Scott: But an iPad is probably the most popular device that will only charge if it sees two amps.

701
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:29,670
Scott: And almost every USB port you encounter will only be able to provide one.

702
00:36:30,252 --> 00:36:44,750
Scott: So you need to use the Apple given charger to charge your iPad or get a charger that has specifically USB two-amp ports on it and it'll probably have a cable to, you know, a power cable to plug into the wall to get extra juice to power those ports.

703
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,590
Scott: I bought pretty much the best one of these that you can buy.

704
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:52,690
Scott: And it only has two two-amp ports and two one-amp ports for charging USB devices.

705
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:56,770
Scott: Because think about it, that's already four, five, six amps.

706
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:58,035
Scott: That's a lot.

707
00:36:58,055 --> 00:37:04,570
Scott: So, you know, if you made one that was like, you know, like ten two-amp ports, that's 20 amps, you could kill yourself with that.

708
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:05,358
Rym: Yeah.

709
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:08,510
Rym: So speaking of killing yourself, here's the part that people don't seem to get.

710
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:11,428
Rym: There's four pins on standard two USB two.

711
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:13,555
Rym: Don't worry about USB.

712
00:37:13,776 --> 00:37:17,070
Rym: one is effectively, like it's all backward compatible.

713
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,079
Rym: It all just kind of works.

714
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,949
Rym: You don't need to worry about it.

715
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:19,995
Rym: There's four pins.

716
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,210
Rym: Two of those pins are for data.

717
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,829
Rym: Because it sends the same data over both pins.

718
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,530
Rym: Opposite.

719
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,012
Rym: Yes.

720
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:29,448
Rym: The same way ethernet cables do.

721
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,850
Scott: So you have two cables and on cable, if you want to send a one from one end to the other.

722
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,530
Scott: If I want to send Rym a one, we have two basically cups on strings, right?

723
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,715
Scott: I want to send them a one.

724
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:43,210
Scott: So on the left cup, I say one and the right cup, I say zero.

725
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:47,170
Scott: And on his end, he gets a one on the left cup and a zero on the right cup.

726
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:47,810
Scott: And he's like, aha.

727
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:49,970
Rym: Now that works because of math.

728
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:54,810
Rym: If you send the same signal with the opposite, so one's plus ten and one's minus ten.

729
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,390
Rym: Just to give you some egregious example.

730
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,950
Rym: That's the point where you're sending your data.

731
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:06,390
Rym: Then if there's interference, it'll push both of those waves in the same direction because the cables are right next to each other.

732
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:11,330
Rym: So as a result, you can mathematically eliminate the noise at the other end.

733
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:11,711
Scott: Right.

734
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:15,290
Scott: So something happens that ruins the signal there.

735
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,069
Scott: It's like, OK, I sent a one on cup one, so it'll become a two.

736
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,069
Scott: And the zero on the other cup will become like a negative one.

737
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:26,110
Scott: And if I go, he'll get it on the other end and be like, oh, all right, that should have been a one.

738
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,146
Scott: These both got boosted up.

739
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:27,434
Scott: Yep.

740
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:28,132
Rym: Right.

741
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:31,329
Scott: They got pushed away from each other or toward, you know.

742
00:38:32,873 --> 00:38:35,950
Rym: So USB can deliver a lot of power.

743
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:38,330
Rym: I mean, powered USB, which I'll talk about in a second.

744
00:38:38,732 --> 00:38:40,150
Rym: I just looked up because I forgot how much.

745
00:38:40,891 --> 00:38:46,310
Rym: It operates on a 48 volt DC and can send up to 25 fucking watts.

746
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:47,133
Scott: Whoa.

747
00:38:47,678 --> 00:38:48,729
Scott: That's enough for speakers, yo.

748
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:49,990
Rym: There's crazy stuff.

749
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,450
Scott: I mean, they have USB monitors now, so you can get some serious power out of it.

750
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:55,410
Rym: Well, powered USB is special, so we'll get to that.

751
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,309
Rym: That's not something that uses extra pins.

752
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,790
Scott: It's like power over ethernet power.

753
00:38:59,893 --> 00:39:01,269
Rym: Actually, yes, it's very related to that.

754
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:06,790
Rym: So those four pins, the other two pins are one's ground and one's power.

755
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,169
Rym: It's actually really simple.

756
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,647
Scott: It's so simple.

757
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:14,330
Rym: So when you plug a lamp in, how do you not accidentally create a voltage loop?

758
00:39:16,473 --> 00:39:17,306
Scott: Because it just is.

759
00:39:18,091 --> 00:39:18,623
Rym: What do you mean?

760
00:39:18,684 --> 00:39:18,889
Rym: it just is?

761
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:20,749
Rym: So I got a lamp.

762
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,090
Rym: I got those two little prongs that live in the United States.

763
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,690
Rym: Maybe let's say two prongs.

764
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,610
Rym: Forget the three prongs.

765
00:39:25,992 --> 00:39:28,430
Rym: I can plug my fucking cable in either way.

766
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,130
Rym: It doesn't matter.

767
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,470
Rym: 180 degrees, it's fine.

768
00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:33,090
Rym: How come I can't fuck up?

769
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:40,330
Rym: I can't plug an extension cord into power and then plug the other end of that extension cord into power.

770
00:39:40,853 --> 00:39:41,869
Rym: Why doesn't that ever happen?

771
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,079
Scott: Because it's AC?

772
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:44,665
Scott: It's smart?

773
00:39:44,726 --> 00:39:45,090
Scott: I don't know.

774
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,330
Rym: No, because the ends are different.

775
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,870
Scott: I thought, yeah, but it doesn't matter which end is which.

776
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,669
Scott: They're just different shapes.

777
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,949
Rym: Yes, but they're different shapes.

778
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,489
Rym: The end with the prongs always goes into the place where the power is coming from.

779
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:56,790
Scott: Okay.

780
00:39:56,991 --> 00:40:01,349
Rym: So there's no way to plug the thing where power is coming out into the thing where power is coming from.

781
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,169
Rym: You can't plug a socket into a socket or a plug into a plug.

782
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:08,550
Rym: Unless you're a moron and you really, really work at it.

783
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,870
Scott: Oh, I thought you meant a loop between the two prongs.

784
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:17,389
Scott: You're talking about taking the end where the light bulb is and plugging that into the wall also.

785
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:25,669
Rym: Well, you can't make a loop between the two prongs either using standard cables because no matter what you plug things into, you'll never get a loop.

786
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:28,843
Rym: You can't get a loop with normal cables.

787
00:40:29,204 --> 00:40:30,370
Rym: in a way that would be meaningful.

788
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,970
Scott: You could go and make a cable that has prongs on one end and prongs on the other end and plug them both into the wall.

789
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:35,494
Scott: And you know what?

790
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:37,010
Rym: People die every year doing that.

791
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,508
Rym: You know what the use case is?

792
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:39,408
Scott: Suicide?

793
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,676
Scott: No, no.

794
00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:41,583
Rym: It's something you're going to go,

795
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:42,067
Rym: "Uh-oh.".

796
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:47,244
Rym: Every year, in fact, if you go to Home Depot around Christmas, you'll see signs saying, "Never do

797
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:47,466
Rym: this.".

798
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:48,990
Scott: Oh, Christmas lights?

799
00:40:49,130 --> 00:41:00,226
Rym: Yes, because people will string up Christmas lights the wrong way, be done, realize they can't plug their shit in, and rather than unwind all the cables, they'll stick a plug-to-plug adapter.

800
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:03,890
Rym: in the end, and thus at the top of their tree is a death spike.

801
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,269
Rym: Lots of people get killed by that every year.

802
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,787
Rym: So USB has the same thing.

803
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:13,430
Rym: USB-A does not mean anything special.

804
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,630
Rym: USB-A is the connector that you plug into your computer.

805
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,870
Rym: It's the USB thing that you know, the rectangle.

806
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:26,609
Rym: The USB-A socket is what you plug into, and the USB-A socket is where power comes from.

807
00:41:27,913 --> 00:41:30,027
Rym: It's where the controlling device is.

808
00:41:30,812 --> 00:41:31,710
Rym: It's the computer.

809
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,889
Rym: Whatever counts as the computer is USB-A.

810
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:38,910
Rym: USB-B is whatever you plug that computer into.

811
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:40,399
Rym: That's the device.

812
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:41,670
Rym: That's the hard drive.

813
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:47,329
Rym: So that little square guy that you plug into printers, that's the reason you have two different cables.

814
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:48,589
Rym: Yeah, the big square one.

815
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:53,149
Rym: The thing you plug into a printer or a scanner, or like a shitty old phone.

816
00:41:53,992 --> 00:42:01,769
Rym: Actually, I don't think any phone used B. I can't imagine a phone that used B. Mostly printers and scanners and hard drives back in the day.

817
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:09,610
Rym: That's B. That way, you'll never plug a computer into itself and cause the voltage to hit itself and short out.

818
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,689
Rym: You'll never cause an electrical loop.

819
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,050
Scott: But what if I just want to connect two computers to each other with a USB cable?

820
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,017
Rym: You fucking can't.

821
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:17,330
Rym: It's not designed for that.

822
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,969
Rym: The architecture is not designed to do that.

823
00:42:20,316 --> 00:42:20,890
Scott: That's sad.

824
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,689
Rym: Now, you could have designed it that way.

825
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,167
Rym: You could have had computers have A's and B's.

826
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:32,090
Rym: There are cables that are active cables that have logic inside of them.

827
00:42:32,472 --> 00:42:35,430
Rym: that will have an A cable coming out of both ends, an A plug.

828
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:40,709
Rym: Plug it into two computers and the cable acts like a device that will allow data transfer.

829
00:42:41,671 --> 00:42:44,570
Rym: It'll make both devices look like, I guess, external hard drives.

830
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:45,790
Scott: Something like that.

831
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,189
Rym: Yeah, like those things exist.

832
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:54,570
Scott: A lot of people, there's buttons you can push to turn a MacBook into a hard drive and then connect it in that kind of way.

833
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:55,628
Rym: Ooh, we'll get to that.

834
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,789
Rym: I think that's like a USB on the go.

835
00:42:58,772 --> 00:42:59,610
Rym: I think that's what it's called.

836
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:04,030
Rym: It's something with phones that I didn't know about until about a couple months ago.

837
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:11,729
Scott: Yeah, I think if you hold a certain button down while you boot up a MacBook, it becomes a hard drive and then you can plug that into another computer and mount it.

838
00:43:12,532 --> 00:43:15,490
Rym: You might have noticed that people say there's micro and mini USB.

839
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:19,990
Rym: Micro and mini, what you see are both B connectors.

840
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,350
Rym: They're just smaller versions of the B connector.

841
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,130
Scott: Yep, they work in exactly the same way.

842
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:28,230
Scott: They're just a smaller, different, better shape because we have smaller, different, better devices.

843
00:43:28,892 --> 00:43:30,929
Rym: Mini is deprecated because it's way too big.

844
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,430
Scott: Right, mini is the one that you usually see on Blackberries.

845
00:43:33,751 --> 00:43:34,590
Scott: That one is dead.

846
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,110
Scott: Micro is the one you see on Kindles and Android phones.

847
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,810
Scott: That is the new one that is still being used.

848
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:43,469
Scott: No new device should be using the mini one, but I'm sure some still do.

849
00:43:44,113 --> 00:43:45,390
Scott: I have a lot of devices that use it.

850
00:43:45,511 --> 00:43:46,890
Rym: A lot of cameras and things that use it.

851
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,749
Scott: I have some external hard drives that use it.

852
00:43:49,652 --> 00:43:53,087
Scott: It's still around, but you're not supposed to use it anymore, but people do.

853
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:55,410
Scott: There's not anything wrong with it.

854
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:56,929
Scott: It's just unnecessarily large.

855
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:04,407
Rym: So your typical USB cable you use to charge your phone is USB-A to USB micro-B.

856
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,069
Rym: But Black Dynamite, isn't there a micro-A?

857
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,190
Rym: And the answer is yes, but no one uses it.

858
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,209
Rym: There's also a mini-A.

859
00:44:11,672 --> 00:44:13,210
Rym: There's two variants of both ends.

860
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,449
Rym: It just turns out that there was no--.

861
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,650
Scott: There's no one actually using that ever.

862
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,810
Rym: I've seen them in person.

863
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:19,566
Rym: I've touched them.

864
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,250
Rym: I had them for a few weird devices I worked with over the years.

865
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,409
Rym: You can find pictures of them online.

866
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,750
Scott: But if you have a printer, why do you need a micro-connector on a printer?

867
00:44:29,672 --> 00:44:31,290
Scott: That's why you don't see these things too often.

868
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,605
Rym: You could have a micro-connector on a printer because that would be a B.

869
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:34,729
Scott: Well, you could.

870
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,910
Rym: Why would you need a micro on a computer is the question.

871
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:45,470
Scott: Well, you could have a situation where you had, say, like a keyboard, right?

872
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:49,670
Scott: And the keyboard had a removable cable, right?

873
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:55,829
Scott: So then you would see the weird-- Most keyboards, just the cables, just coming right out of the keyboard, right?

874
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:05,889
Rym: But if the keyboard actually had a completely detachable cable-- But then it would still be A on the computer end and then micro or mini-B on the keyboard end.

875
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:07,345
Rym: It wouldn't be micro or mini-A.

876
00:45:08,651 --> 00:45:12,090
Rym: Micro or mini-A would only be useful if you were going to plug that tiny cable into a computer.

877
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:23,450
Rym: It turns out that any device that is the A device, the alpha, the computer, doesn't really matter if the cable is slightly smaller because it's a giant-ass computer or laptop anyway.

878
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:28,889
Rym: The variation on that that sort of complicates things is--.

879
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,229
Rym: I've got to look this up again because I've never used it.

880
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,536
Rym: Is the on-the-go USB on the go?

881
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,456
Rym: Go to whatever it is.

882
00:45:38,811 --> 00:45:43,084
Rym: The connectors on some phones are both micro-A and micro-B compatible.

883
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:46,285
Scott: And they can only be one at a time?

884
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,051
Rym: Yes.

885
00:45:47,434 --> 00:45:57,970
Rym: So if I plug a keyboard into my phone, then it acts like an A and accepts the connection from the keyboard, and now I have a keyboard.

886
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,930
Rym: It's like I plugged a keyboard into my computer.

887
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:01,270
Rym: My phone is now a computer.

888
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:07,286
Rym: But if I plug a B cable into it, the phone says, "Oh, I guess I'm the external hard drive for some other

889
00:46:07,327 --> 00:46:07,750
Rym: computer.".

890
00:46:08,454 --> 00:46:12,870
Rym: And you need a lot of logic to make sure you don't fuck that up because only As can send power.

891
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,690
Scott: This is really similar to the Bluetooth situation, right?

892
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,910
Scott: Where it's like sometimes you're in your car and you want to connect your car to your phone with Bluetooth.

893
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:31,110
Scott: So sometimes you go into the car's UI to find the phone and connect to it, and sometimes you go on the phone to try to pair with the car, as one of them is in charge and one of them is sort of not in charge.

894
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:50,684
Rym: Now, luckily, you can't plug B into A and A into B. The sockets that allow this sort of on-the-go thing are designed to accept both A and B. So it's still pretty much impossible to plug anything into a USB port the wrong way unless you buy an illegal or non-spec cable.

895
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:51,589
Rym: that does something stupid.

896
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,689
Scott: So yeah, USB 3, the cables look-- Just way the hell faster.

897
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:01,689
Rym: USB 3, for one, uses nine pins, not four.

898
00:47:01,971 --> 00:47:14,970
Scott: Yep, but they've arranged them in the cable in such a way that there's still the original four are in there and will be used as the original four, but it'll just be using USB 2, and those other pins won't be doing shit.

899
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,314
Rym: Exactly.

900
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,310
Rym: So usually the only way to tell is that a USB 3 port-- Are blue.

901
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,470
Rym: --tend to be blue, but that's not required.

902
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,730
Scott: It's not required, but it's sort of a helpful thing, right?

903
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,902
Scott: I think USB 2-- Everything I have that's USB 3 is blue.

904
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:28,590
Scott: Even the USB stick I bought is blue.

905
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:33,930
Rym: USB 2 was, I think, supposed to be white and one was black, but it doesn't really matter anymore.

906
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:34,786
Scott: Yeah, I don't see that ever.

907
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:40,610
Rym: Now a lot of USB 2s on laptops are yellow because that's the one that's also the give power while I'm asleep.

908
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,266
Scott: Yeah, the yellow one, I mean, everything is USB 2 now.

909
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,810
Scott: I haven't seen a USB 1 port in forever.

910
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:58,369
Scott: But yeah, yellow usually means even if you turn this computer off and put it to sleep, not off completely, and you plug this laptop into the wall, this USB port will still have power just coming out of it if you want to charge your phone or some shit.

911
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,110
Rym: So there's even further specifications.

912
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,571
Rym: There's nine pins in USB 3.

913
00:48:03,571 --> 00:48:07,630
Rym: Powered USB 3 that can give a shit ton of power has two additional pins.

914
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:09,010
Rym: Now here's the difference.

915
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,689
Rym: USB 3 isn't just faster.

916
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:13,990
Rym: It also is bi-directional.

917
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:14,888
Scott: Full duplex.

918
00:48:15,452 --> 00:48:17,190
Rym: USB 2 is not full duplex, shit guys.

919
00:48:17,491 --> 00:48:19,369
Rym: You can't send and receive data at the same time.

920
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,570
Scott: Yeah, only one talker at a time.

921
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:22,510
Scott: This is a big deal.

922
00:48:23,332 --> 00:48:28,350
Scott: We used to have an ethernet hub in college that was not full duplex, and that's why it was so cheap.

923
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:34,970
Scott: And basically it means that if I'm talking to you, you can't talk until I stop talking, and then you can talk again.

924
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:40,790
Rym: That's why CDMA in ethernet stands for collision detection multiple access.

925
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:45,329
Rym: So you would listen for collisions because sometimes two people would collide with each other.

926
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:53,530
Rym: But with modern switches with full duplex, there's no such thing as collisions because there's only one computer on any given segment.

927
00:48:53,671 --> 00:49:01,270
Scott: So with USB 3, let's say you had a hard drive and you were reading data from the hard drive, like a USB stick, you couldn't write data to the hard drive at the same time.

928
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:03,550
Scott: You had to wait for the reading to be done and then do the writing.

929
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:05,002
Rym: Or interleave it back and forth.

930
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:13,050
Scott: You think, wait a minute, I dragged a file off my USB stick and then dragged a file onto it, and both of the progress meters in Windows moved.

931
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:14,550
Scott: They moved slow, but they moved.

932
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:20,388
Scott: It's like, that's right, because what Windows is doing is basically going read, write, read, write, read, write, read, write, read, write, and alternating between the two.

933
00:49:21,033 --> 00:49:28,150
Scott: If you had a USB 3 stick and were using USB 3, both of those would move at full speed because it could read and write simultaneously.

934
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:42,310
Rym: Now, the reason why sound cards in the old days, even with USB 2, sucked ass, was that because it's not full duplex, it was really hard to have synchronous streams of data.

935
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:47,589
Rym: There was an isochronous mode that would let you do that, but it wasn't super high bandwidth.

936
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:47,965
Rym: ASIO.

937
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:48,989
Rym: Yeah, ISO.

938
00:49:49,578 --> 00:49:50,248
Rym: I-O synchronous.

939
00:49:50,873 --> 00:49:51,309
Scott: ASIO, whatever.

940
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:52,386
Rym: Yeah, not ASIO.

941
00:49:53,196 --> 00:49:53,510
Scott: Okay.

942
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:55,890
Rym: That's something different altogether.

943
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,830
Rym: Let's talk about FireWire if you want to get into that business.

944
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:05,930
Rym: Now, I don't want to talk about the differences between USB and FireWire, but low bandwidth coupled with the fact that there's very high latency.

945
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,330
Rym: USB has latencies, depending on how it's configured, up to a millisecond.

946
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:23,749
Scott: This is why gaming mice are important to get because latency matters in a gaming application, but it doesn't really matter for printing or a lot of other things, but you need a gaming mouse keyboard mostly because it's going to mitigate USB latency as much as possible.

947
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:31,570
Rym: Now, depending on what mode the USB is operating in, that is or is not a concern, which is another reason why sometimes you might have issues.

948
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:41,630
Rym: USB cannot send data at its full rate and send its maximum power at the same time because the power interferes with the data.

949
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:46,250
Scott: Yeah, even using the two wires for the data is not enough to mitigate a crap ton of interference.

950
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:47,149
Scott: You can only have so much.

951
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:55,269
Rym: So that is why some devices, when they're charging, cannot also be used for data transfers or seem really slow suddenly.

952
00:50:57,713 --> 00:51:03,330
Rym: So yeah, the last cool thing I really want to point out is that if you look at USB 3.0 connectors, they're complicated.

953
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,270
Rym: They look almost ghetto and hacked together.

954
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:11,709
Rym: They look like two connectors kind of stuck onto each other because that's literally what they are.

955
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:19,070
Rym: A USB 3.0 slot, a B-slot, is a big square with another rectangle hanging off on top of it.

956
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:24,110
Rym: That way you could plug a USB 2.0 cable into it for backward compatibility.

957
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:33,969
Rym: Micro 3.0 is a USB micro cable with another ghetto-ass micro 3.0 cable kind of stuck next to it for the same reason.

958
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,390
Scott: This is a pattern you see in a lot of computer cables.

959
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:47,770
Scott: If you build computers, you'll notice they had ATX power connectors, and then they did ATX+4, which is they had the ATX power connector and then a little four extra thingies hanging off the edge of it to make it bigger when they needed more power.

960
00:51:48,091 --> 00:51:54,929
Rym: Whenever you get a power supply, and then depending on your motherboard and processor, you would break off some of the pins on the end of the power to plug it in.

961
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:55,319
Scott: Yep.

962
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:57,389
Rym: Yeah, so it's like that.

963
00:51:58,372 --> 00:52:05,510
Rym: So USB 3.0 and 2.0 are, well, 3.0 is backward compatible to 2.0, so you can plug a 3.0 device into a 2.0 computer just fine.

964
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:06,830
Scott: And it'll just work slowly and shiddily.

965
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:12,809
Rym: But you have to know that you can just plug it into the bottom half or the left half of that jank-ass looking plug.

966
00:52:13,035 --> 00:52:13,344
Rym: Mm-hmm.

967
00:52:13,975 --> 00:52:14,381
Rym: So, yeah.

968
00:52:16,253 --> 00:52:26,030
Rym: The moral of all this, because I could go on, is that the only parts we talked about were the parts that are relevant in any amount of expert use of computers.

969
00:52:26,914 --> 00:52:28,610
Rym: So you don't need to know the depth.

970
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:33,929
Rym: You don't need to know the actual signaling unless you're working with USB devices on the hardware level.

971
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:42,030
Rym: You don't need to know the exact voltages and amperages and powers available and latency.

972
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,910
Scott: Because you can look that shit up on Google if you need to know.

973
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,350
Rym: Unless you're the kind of person who does audio, for example.

974
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:55,990
Rym: You really need to know about how USB works if you want to use a USB-driven audio device and make sure it isn't a cheap-ass USB 2.0 audio device.

975
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:06,270
Rym: But the complexity behind USB is something that seems so simple, so straightforward, so ubiquitous that you don't even think about it.

976
00:53:06,671 --> 00:53:12,830
Scott: The only reason we think about it is because I was there in those days without USB, so I appreciate the things it does.

977
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:19,770
Scott: These people who just always had USB don't appreciate, like, you used to not be able to just plug shit into the computer while it's on.

978
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:21,523
Rym: Yeah, read this Wikipedia page.

979
00:53:21,604 --> 00:53:22,108
Rym: It is huge.

980
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:23,890
Rym: They'll show you the full depth of all this.

981
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,169
Scott: Every frickin' device used to have a different kind of plug.

982
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:30,670
Rym: Every aspect of computing is that deep, even the things that seem very simple.

983
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:34,609
Rym: But simultaneously, just because it's deep doesn't mean you should ignore it.

984
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:42,950
Rym: You need to know at least the shallow waiting depth of every part of a computer, if you want to call yourself a computer person.

985
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:51,330
Rym: Because then, when something doesn't work with USB, or you run into an issue, you'll at least understand the basic nature of the issue.

986
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:57,950
Rym: If you plug in a weird Blackberry and it won't charge, you'll at least understand the kinds of things that might be causing that.

987
00:53:58,573 --> 00:54:00,628
Rym: So you'll know maybe how to fix it.

988
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:01,490
Rym: Maybe.

989
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,826
Rym: Yeah, or you'll at least know if you actually have USB 3.0 or not.

990
00:54:08,393 --> 00:54:10,550
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

991
00:54:10,671 --> 00:54:15,690
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

992
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:21,070
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

993
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,990
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

994
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:28,689
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

995
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,266
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

996
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,550
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

997
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,690
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

998
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:05,200
Scott: She came into the shop and said, "I want to know what the problem

999
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:05,380
Scott: is.".

1000
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:09,055
Scott: I said, "You don't want to know what the problem

1001
00:55:09,195 --> 00:55:09,296
Scott: is.".

1002
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,435
Scott: And she said, "I want to know what the problem is so I can get the problem

1003
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:14,956
Scott: fixed.".

1004
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:21,793
Scott: I said, "You don't want to know what the solution to the problem is and you don't want to know what your problem

1005
00:55:21,914 --> 00:55:22,014
Scott: is.".

1006
00:55:23,283 --> 00:55:25,879
Scott: She says, "How do you know that I'm not going to like

1007
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:25,980
Scott: it?".

1008
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,812
Scott: I said, "I know you're not going to like

1009
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:27,974
Scott: it.".

1010
00:55:29,523 --> 00:55:33,239
Scott: So she said, "Just tell me what it is and I'll tell you if I like

1011
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:33,380
Scott: it.".

1012
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,849
Scott: And I said, "Maybe.

1013
00:55:37,836 --> 00:55:38,819
Scott: Maybe I'll tell

1014
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:38,960
Scott: you.".

1015
00:55:39,762 --> 00:55:41,078
Scott: She said, "Why won't you tell

1016
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:41,199
Scott: me?".

1017
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:42,629
Scott: I said, "The problem's your

1018
00:55:42,831 --> 00:55:42,972
Scott: ass.".

1019
00:55:44,363 --> 00:55:44,749
Scott: She said,

1020
00:55:44,912 --> 00:55:45,156
Scott: "What?".

1021
00:55:45,602 --> 00:55:46,871
Scott: I said, "The problem's your

1022
00:55:47,113 --> 00:55:47,254
Scott: ass.".

1023
00:55:48,727 --> 00:55:49,132
Scott: She said,

1024
00:55:49,314 --> 00:55:49,556
Scott: "What?".

1025
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:52,300
Scott: I said, "The problem's your fucking ass.

1026
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,096
Scott: Your ass is all fucked up and you got problems with your

1027
00:55:56,358 --> 00:55:56,438
Scott: ass.".

1028
00:55:57,223 --> 00:55:59,038
Scott: She said, "Why are you saying this to

1029
00:55:59,099 --> 00:55:59,180
Scott: me?".

1030
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,191
Scott: And I said, "It's your fucking problem.

1031
00:56:01,211 --> 00:56:02,760
Scott: You're the one with the fucked up...".
