1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,132
Rym: It's Tuesday April 1st 2014.

2
00:00:12,132 --> 00:00:15,281
Rym: I'm Rym I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

3
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,166
Rym: Why no one will game with you?

4
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:18,590
Rym: and no we're not joking.

5
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:22,576
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:28,204
Rym: Happy the internet is nothing but lies for 24 hours day.

7
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:32,842
Scott: Unhappy the internet is nothing but lies to 24 hours day, and you know what.

8
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,889
Scott: so this year was better and worse.

9
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:39,070
Rym: Yeah, there weren't like slashdot had some real stuff going on right now.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,940
Rym: Park was actually really clever, and they they almost got me.

11
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:48,176
Scott: it was better and that there was actually some fools and Less just bullshit.

12
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,390
Scott: it was better and that there was less bullshit.

13
00:00:52,092 --> 00:01:00,100
Scott: But it was worse and that a lot of people were starting early perhaps using time zones as an excuse Forgetting that New York is the only place in the world.

14
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:02,632
Rym: You know it's funny because in the financial world That's like.

15
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:03,718
Rym: that's kind of how it goes.

16
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:05,830
Rym: people in the other time zones of the u.s.

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,870
Rym: Basically have to keep New York hours anyway, that's exactly right.

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,545
Scott: You know when you see on TV like some office They always have those clocks on the wall that are like London, New York whatever.

19
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:17,790
Scott: in New York We have one clock on the wall, New York.

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,534
Rym: Well now you'll have to.

21
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:21,430
Rym: you'll have London because you want to know when you can call people in London.

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,809
Scott: But you know you want to know they're gonna call you so you can leave work.

23
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:34,270
Rym: But I gotta say FARC almost got me because I you know far like I love FARC.

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,210
Rym: I've been reading FARC for a long fucking time.

25
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:53,405
Rym: I kind of realized that today because what far I go to FARC and I see the headline That's like Ronald Reagan finally died 10 years after his brain went into Alzheimer's and I remember and all I thought was That already happened, but then there's that slight moment of right right.

26
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,790
Rym: There's no way he was still alive.

27
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:57,663
Scott: Why would you even have to question that?

28
00:01:57,844 --> 00:01:58,930
Rym: because the news thing appears?

29
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,695
Scott: I'm like oh Ronald Reagan says like yeah, you know what I would think How the headline was written.

30
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:09,110
Scott: I might not think that the news was he died today, but oh something about his death.

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,885
Scott: So what I thought was like, you know, someone's writing a news article about the past.

32
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:15,377
Rym: So what I thought was Well, okay.

33
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,470
Rym: There's obviously something else going on here because FARC.

34
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:18,794
Rym: I mean, that's the point of FARC.

35
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:23,430
Rym: the headline is something funny or intriguing and the article might be something very different.

36
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:38,960
Rym: So I click on it and the article is like Ronald Reagan died today on legitimate news and before I thought anything I noticed dateline today's date Mmm, so then I go to the comments and I see.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,670
Rym: so I see a few people who were gotten by it and a few other people who were like wait a minute that article is way old and Then I realized what was going on.

38
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,720
Rym: Every link on FARC today was just from 2004.

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,830
Rym: Okay, that's all they did ten years ago.

40
00:02:55,031 --> 00:03:01,542
Rym: So you go to every thread and there's a few people who either some people are like, oh my god This is a duplicate from 2004.

41
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,286
Rym: The fuck FARC.

42
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:09,750
Rym: Come on I think that was the second best thing I saw today related to the April of fools.

43
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:17,269
Scott: But it reminds you if you really just need some sort of you know Serotonin fix in your brain and there's no new news coming in fast enough.

44
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:21,204
Scott: Just go to news 20 years ago or 10 years ago.

45
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,870
Rym: There's Wikipedia pages that do that.

46
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,466
Rym: They're like what happened in this year, right?

47
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,387
Scott: You know go to go to reddit and go like page a thousand and see what's there.

48
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:30,950
Scott: right there'll be something there.

49
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,805
Rym: Yeah, just start reading FARC archives, I guess.

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,237
Rym: Yeah But Dorkly pretty much had it best.

51
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:39,202
Scott: They had the perfectness.

52
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:42,170
Rym: that video is what all your April Fools jokes look like.

53
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:43,143
Scott: That's exactly right.

54
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:49,265
Scott: Homestar runner updated which it wasn't really a fool or a thing.

55
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:50,490
Scott: It was just it updated.

56
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:57,341
Rym: They just updated it on April Fool's Day to be like what should have happened is like when Google announced gmail for real on April Fool's Day.

57
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,802
Rym: Valve should have announced half-life 3 today like for real.

58
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:02,669
Rym: exactly that would have been it.

59
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:08,686
Rym: But no instead they launched a half-life 4 and halo 5.

60
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:18,490
Rym: So In personal life stuff, you know We talked about that flying episode and part of the reason I thought of doing that Is that it's really hard to book flights to and from places that aren't New York or London.

61
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,767
Rym: Like you want to fly direct to Boston from anywhere.

62
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:22,269
Rym: good luck.

63
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:26,970
Rym: And yeah, I just last-minute booked all these flights to Paris and everything.

64
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:33,438
Rym: Oh, so if anyone's gonna be in Paris I'm late to from us at trade tech Paris.

65
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,066
Rym: I don't do buddy and you want to hang out.

66
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:37,570
Rym: I might be kind of bored there.

67
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:42,627
Scott: You're gonna go to France in Paris and be bored.

68
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:43,390
Rym: How is that?

69
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:49,950
Rym: Two of those days Scott, you know how sometimes we go to Conventions run by people where we owe them a favor.

70
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,560
Rym: This is my excited about going to those convention.

71
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:54,930
Scott: My company sends me to a place like that.

72
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,175
Rym: You're just not gonna go to the convention.

73
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,319
Scott: I did exactly right.

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,147
Scott: I will go to the Louvre or two.

75
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,837
Rym: Ah, so if it's a way because we booked at the last second, there weren't any good flights or liberty I'm actually flying out Saturday.

76
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,628
Rym: So I'll get to Paris at like 11 a.m.

77
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:10,130
Rym: On Sunday.

78
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:16,137
Rym: so I got the whole day to just fuck around in Paris and Monday And I'll be by myself.

79
00:05:16,237 --> 00:05:21,740
Rym: So I'll probably get some business meetings, but other than those meetings Wandering around fuck around just like London.

80
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:27,841
Rym: and then Tuesday Wednesday is the conference My CEOs flying with me, but he's leaving early on Wednesday.

81
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:34,116
Rym: So there's no one to supervise me and I'm flying home Thursday at like 2 p.m.

82
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:37,367
Rym: Which will get me to packs Thursday night at like 6 p.m.

83
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:41,650
Rym: Because the time zones Okay, so I'll have a bunch of days to fuck around in Paris.

84
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:44,670
Rym: So a bunch of you tried to meet up with me in London.

85
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:46,337
Rym: Sorry, that didn't happen.

86
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,328
Rym: But I actually had a lot less time than I thought I'd have.

87
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:54,030
Scott: Why don't you just tell them to meet you at the Eiffel Tower at like 6 or something?

88
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,330
Rym: Maybe but I don't want to be beholden to that schedule.

89
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,013
Rym: That's my trouble.

90
00:05:57,456 --> 00:06:00,290
Rym: part of the reason I didn't meet up with anyone in London is you're not beholden to a schedule.

91
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,353
Scott: You can't meet anyone.

92
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,337
Scott: That's how it works.

93
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:05,407
Rym: Yeah, I could be like, yeah, I'm meeting people works.

94
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:06,430
Scott: There needs to be a time.

95
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:08,099
Rym: I'm at this place right now.

96
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,089
Rym: I'll be here for the next two hours go.

97
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:13,104
Scott: How is anyone gonna make it there within the two hours in New York?

98
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,128
Rym: I think someone would make it.

99
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:15,588
Scott: Yeah, we have a subway.

100
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:17,488
Rym: Paris has a subway.

101
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,520
Rym: Yeah, that's way better than London subway.

102
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,190
Scott: Sure, but it is not up to par with the New York subway.

103
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,163
Rym: No subway in the world is up to par.

104
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:27,049
Rym: Ding ding ding ding ding.

105
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:30,717
Rym: But uh, yeah, that's that's what I got.

106
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:31,841
Rym: that's what's going on in my life.

107
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:34,189
Rym: Okay, so I'm flying home through Reykjavik.

108
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,160
Rym: Okay, but I can't.

109
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,090
Rym: I don't have enough time.

110
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:42,795
Rym: Basically what I wanted to do was stop in Reykjavik for like a day and then just go play in a volcano Yeah and come back.

111
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:43,598
Rym: Yeah, basically.

112
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,024
Rym: Yeah, but I didn't have enough time.

113
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:46,309
Rym: So I'm only gonna be there for like an hour.

114
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:48,929
Scott: No, that doesn't count if you don't leave the airport.

115
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:51,256
Rym: Actually, no, it doesn't.

116
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:52,282
Rym: so yeah.

117
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:53,872
Rym: All right That's that.

118
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,350
Rym: I don't have anything else exciting waiting for you to jump in with some news or something.

119
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,481
Scott: Oh, you want to be jumping out got a news, but it's just a baby tiny news.

120
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:02,046
Scott: Not a very exciting news.

121
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,920
Scott: So Capcom I guess is doing something.

122
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:08,290
Scott: I guess maybe something.

123
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,290
Scott: Yeah, you know they've been pretty fail for a while now.

124
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:20,599
Scott: So and since they're not making any new Megaman's at least not as far as anyone knows They're gonna do something else.

125
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,870
Scott: They're just gonna re-release some old Megaman's For the for the 3ds in the digital download store.

126
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:37,210
Scott: So the games they're gonna put out are Megaman 2 3 4 5 and Megaman Xtreme and Xtreme 2. and you're probably sitting you wanna what the fuck is Megaman Xtreme and Xtreme?

127
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,388
Scott: Wait, what are these see in?

128
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,788
Scott: Japan where the games are real.

129
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:53,568
Scott: When they put out Megaman while Rockman on the Gameboy, they put out Rockman world Which is basically the Gameboy version of Megaman, right and in the US they didn't put that out.

130
00:07:53,748 --> 00:08:10,850
Scott: They put out Megaman 2 Gameboy which was Basically Rockman world, you know poured it over now But they renamed it to basically be the same name as Megaman 2. so it's like oh You get confused if I say Megaman 2 you had to be like are you you know?

131
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,754
Scott: You know, which game I'm talking about, but I could be talking about the Gameboy one Which is bullshit.

132
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:20,625
Scott: Yeah, just called it Megaman world - it wouldn't have been a problem guys.

133
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:22,530
Rym: It worked for Mario sure.

134
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:36,863
Scott: Anyway, so Basically Rockman world 2 3 4 5 and then the 2 Gameboy Color Megamans are gonna come out on the 3ds in the download store But they're letting you vote on their website, which one comes first.

135
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:39,390
Scott: Yeah, whatever who gives a shit?

136
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,756
Scott: I mean I say it's a baby news.

137
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:45,124
Scott: It's like yeah, it's who cares?

138
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:51,697
Scott: you're gonna put them all out eventually anyway And no one's buying any digital downloads of crappy Sub-rate Megaman games.

139
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:54,148
Scott: and I can just get real Megaman 2 on my 3ds.

140
00:08:54,911 --> 00:09:01,609
Rym: Why would I buy Megaman 2 on my emulator on my phone if I really want exactly exactly.

141
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:10,462
Scott: so There is an attachment to this news that is sort of like a PS Which is that Nintendo also struggling Japanese game companies struggling.

142
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:12,507
Scott: That's a surprise, huh are putting some?

143
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,790
Rym: oh, I see what you're about to say.

144
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:24,230
Scott: They're putting some GBA titles on the Wii U. Right, so it used to be that the virtual console on the Wii and Wii U only had console games.

145
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:27,150
Scott: So you get NES SNES, right?

146
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:36,789
Scott: GameCube n64 Games will not GameCube n64 games in your virtual console on your Wii and your Wii U and that on your virtual console on your 3ds.

147
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:42,670
Scott: Right, you would get portable games Gameboy games Gameboy Color Gameboy Advance games, right?

148
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:52,070
Scott: So for the first time here, they are going to release portable games Gameboy Advance games on the Wii U virtual console.

149
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:59,918
Scott: I wish they would also do NES and SNES games on the 3ds virtual console, but you know what you're gonna do Eventually.

150
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:00,684
Rym: go out of business.

151
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:01,290
Scott: Sure.

152
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:08,248
Scott: Anyway, the first eight games have been announced and all that matters is that one of them is Advance Wars.

153
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,350
Rym: Yeah Except I already own Advance Wars obviously.

154
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:17,552
Scott: But if you don't have GBA Advance Wars and you don't have a piracy card and you don't know how to make it work Etc.

155
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:18,053
Scott: Etc.

156
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:23,870
Scott: You can now legally get Advance Wars for your 3ds at least starting pretty soon.

157
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:31,929
Rym: So part of the trouble is that a game like Advance Wars also Golden Sun Probably not the most fun game to play on your Wii U?

158
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:33,654
Scott: No, not really.

159
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:38,970
Rym: I played a lot of my Advance Wars like on buses and on trains.

160
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:43,330
Rym: Yeah, also Advance Wars 1 is not like the other Advance Wars.

161
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:54,653
Rym: I don't think most people who even profess to like more recent Advance Wars will actually like the GBA Advance Wars 1.

162
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,100
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

163
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:58,330
Scott: so Nintendo continuing to go.

164
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:03,483
Rym: Yep, so Nintendo allowed at least one relatively cool thing to happen.

165
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:08,198
Rym: So yeah before April Fool's Day yesterday I had to go take care of some business.

166
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:11,210
Rym: So I take the subway out of work and I go downtown like further downtown.

167
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:16,187
Rym: There's not much downtown left and I'm looking at a map to figure out like oh, where's this place?

168
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,273
Rym: I'm going What's this address?

169
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:27,155
Rym: and I see this dot like this weird thing on my Google Maps and I zoom in on it And it's a Lucario from Pokemon just hanging out Like what.

170
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:29,106
Scott: and this wasn't April Fool's Day yet.

171
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:29,810
Scott: This is the timing.

172
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:34,405
Rym: Hit back to look and make sure it wasn't April Fool's Day.

173
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:34,887
Rym: That's right.

174
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,252
Rym: I was like, nope It's not.

175
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:44,364
Rym: so I went back in I click on him and I saw an option to catch him Saw an option for a pokedex and for a split second.

176
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:49,438
Rym: I thought that maybe Nintendo decided to not be a fuck-up.

177
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:57,881
Rym: Mm-hmm that maybe the stars are going to align and this was the first Salvo of the world-ending MMO of Pokemon.

178
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:58,402
Rym: That's right.

179
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:01,250
Rym: But no basically it's just a scavenger hunt.

180
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,089
Rym: You know, it's kind of dumb.

181
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,790
Rym: Effectively what happens is on your phone and only on your phone.

182
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,136
Rym: It doesn't work on like a computer.

183
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:14,281
Rym: if you zoom in far enough onto Google Maps You might see a Pokemon and if you click on him you catch him.

184
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,007
Rym: It's literally it.

185
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:17,030
Rym: Good luck.

186
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,579
Rym: Have a whole bunch of fun.

187
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:22,497
Rym: scrolling through Google Maps Very much zoomed in.

188
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:26,390
Rym: also most of the Pokemon are in real cities.

189
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:27,974
Scott: Well, I think they put them in.

190
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:34,010
Scott: if you notice right all the Pokemon regions in the real Pokemon games are based on certain cities.

191
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:45,630
Scott: So like the newest one is based on Paris, you know with the Eiffel Tower in the right and the Pokemon black is based on New York, it's got you know, the Manhattan Island in the middle with I found like a Snorlax and an Eevee, right?

192
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:53,970
Scott: So all most of the Pokemon I've been told are in those actual Pokemon regions Right that you know on the real world.

193
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,527
Scott: So if you want to you know, if you come to New York, it's like there was a Pokemon region.

194
00:12:57,547 --> 00:12:58,070
Scott: That's New York.

195
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,730
Scott: So there's Pokemon there Paris this Pokemon there, right?

196
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:09,386
Rym: You know Tokyo this Pokemon, yeah So yeah, it's cool in theory, but it's basically just completely dumb.

197
00:13:09,406 --> 00:13:10,330
Rym: It's a marketing thing.

198
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,026
Rym: It's it's one of those obsessive boring things to do when you're sitting with your smartphone at work.

199
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:15,910
Rym: Not actually doing work.

200
00:13:16,532 --> 00:13:19,060
Rym: It's not actually a game in any sense.

201
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,164
Rym: That is meaningful.

202
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:24,920
Rym: I Wish this was actually a game.

203
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:30,099
Rym: Imagine if I don't know because I've reviewed Ingress that Augmented reality game that's on Android.

204
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:31,224
Rym: That's not super fun.

205
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:34,575
Rym: Basically just a candy box But it has a pretty good UX.

206
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:46,979
Rym: if they took that basic UX of there's Pokemon and other trainers and Places in the real world and just made that Pokemon That would literally be the greatest game ever.

207
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,110
Rym: Like I can actually see exactly how you should do it.

208
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:54,945
Rym: It's that UX coupled with the Google Maps integration and just Pokemon straight up.

209
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:59,126
Rym: if I'm near you and I see you We can just have a Pokemon battle right there.

210
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:01,642
Rym: live No take backs.

211
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,651
Rym: No saving No nothing.

212
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:11,154
Rym: and just candy boxes up then because as much as I think candy boxes are stupid if the candy boxes were a Canonical Pokemon.

213
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:16,010
Rym: I might have to open up the box get some candy bars touch that guy's hat.

214
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,964
Scott: Hey, you know where any other Pokemon are besides.

215
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:18,709
Scott: ooh, what's that?

216
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,402
Rym: Are you looking for Pokemon right now elements?

217
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:23,427
Scott: What the fuck is that?

218
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:24,070
Rym: Really?

219
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:28,062
Scott: Really, you know what the fuck that is, you don't know new Pokemon.

220
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:28,403
Rym: Do ya?

221
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:30,150
Scott: I've never seen that Pokemon in my life.

222
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:31,710
Scott: Are you sure it's not a Digimon?

223
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:34,552
Scott: I'm pretty sure.

224
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,706
Rym: they probably just offended a whole bunch of our Pokemon fan fans.

225
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:40,090
Scott: That's got to be a Digimon.

226
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:43,801
Rym: So as another much smaller aside, there's an article on polygon.

227
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:48,315
Rym: That's actually about our good friend Conrad craling Who's been on this show before.

228
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:52,310
Rym: he has been on GeekNights multiple times usually really mad about phones.

229
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:56,283
Rym: He worked at Muse games for many years with Emily and Alex our other friends.

230
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:58,250
Rym: we went to RIT with him.

231
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:04,976
Rym: he was this young spry with us, yes who dressed up as safety cone.

232
00:15:05,016 --> 00:15:06,949
Rym: that itself was dressed up as Naruto.

233
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:10,239
Rym: and Yeah, there's an article about him.

234
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:16,342
Scott: barrel a Barrel of sorts a safe go and post the safety barrel picture on that article.

235
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,087
Rym: Oh, did they know?

236
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:18,950
Rym: you should I should.

237
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:20,275
Rym: Are there any comments?

238
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,178
Rym: there are some comments?

239
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:23,406
Rym: it's a picture of Kanye Conrad.

240
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:24,169
Scott: there you go.

241
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:26,606
Rym: Oh people are posting pictures of him from Johnny wander.

242
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:27,130
Scott: There you go.

243
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,410
Rym: So yeah, it's a cool article about a cool company and a cool person and other cool people.

244
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,837
Rym: But this is the one that we know directly.

245
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:37,910
Rym: who's been on GeekNights who you probably have also heard of Because it's been on GeekNights.

246
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:43,327
Rym: Oh and the articles written by Michael Moore someone cool who we also all know and you probably might know especially.

247
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:44,290
Scott: we know people who?

248
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,374
Scott: Do cool things.

249
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,223
Scott: Oh my god, you know what.

250
00:15:47,584 --> 00:15:51,030
Scott: if you live in New York City You will know people who do cool things.

251
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:59,484
Rym: I'm pretty sure that if you live in New York and you do cool things you Literally know every other person who does similar things in the city.

252
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:01,150
Scott: nerds no other.

253
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:05,146
Rym: There's when an anime movie happens like some anime movie.

254
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:05,890
Rym: It's just being screened.

255
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:14,564
Rym: Pretty much everyone who shows up is someone that I know Either because of things like this or because they go to every other anime screening.

256
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,470
Scott: Yeah, so it works.

257
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:18,776
Scott: I see any Pokemon in Astoria.

258
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,002
Rym: I didn't find any in Queens.

259
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:22,386
Rym: I don't think it's.

260
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,690
Scott: maybe this is one of the baseball stadium.

261
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:25,039
Rym: Ah, I'll bet.

262
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:26,790
Rym: not I'll bet Manhattan only.

263
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:34,516
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

264
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,997
Scott: Oh, come on are not Mets fans.

265
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:37,378
Scott: Oh, oh, that's right.

266
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:41,176
Scott: They're Mariners fans, which Nintendo owns of course.

267
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:48,300
Rym: So I try not to do this often, but this is marching band video, but it's pretty impressive.

268
00:16:48,461 --> 00:17:01,191
Rym: Oh, you and your marching band, so when I was in high school, I actually and middle school I actually kind of seriously wanted to make my career Around marching bands and music.

269
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:02,679
Scott: who has that career?

270
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,148
Rym: Some people have that career almost nobody.

271
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:06,530
Scott: You know what?

272
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,861
Scott: You know what the most common career you can get is for that Teacher.

273
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:14,499
Scott: high school band teacher, you know what high school band teachers job is like.

274
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:18,300
Scott: How do you how would you like being a high school band teacher right now?

275
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:21,040
Rym: Mostly what I wanted to do was my primary career.

276
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:29,254
Rym: I was thinking about going into the conservatory being a professional horn player and then on the side I wanted to be involved in marching stuff because I'm just really into that.

277
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:30,580
Rym: I've always been super into that.

278
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:48,906
Rym: So what I have for you is a video of the group that I saw marching that inspired me to be really into that and to get really into like the choreography and just How you actually put these things together like the technical side of Marching band performances and shows.

279
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:52,760
Rym: this is the Phantom Regiment performing Elsa's procession to the cathedral.

280
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,742
Rym: Okay, it's pretty great.

281
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:57,607
Rym: You got a thing of the day.

282
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,150
Scott: Oh, I do have a thing today.

283
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,310
Scott: So here's this really cute little flash game called lamp and vamp, right?

284
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,300
Scott: And basically it's a little turn-based strategy kind of game.

285
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,250
Scott: And once you figure out how it works, you really just keep playing it.

286
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:18,630
Scott: You're a little cute vampire guy right and it's a hex map and every turn you move one space But you can't really move through the houses or any or through the trees.

287
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:30,268
Scott: you just move a move a space and you're in the darkness because you're a vampire and you're trying to get into your coffin because that's where vampires belong and there's people walking around town with torches trying to burn your ass cuz and stake you and shit cuz.

288
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:34,406
Scott: They don't like vampires eating their kids and their wives and themselves.

289
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:44,289
Scott: So You have to make it there without getting seen, you know, they all have the little flashlights that they're you know Lighting up the street with so you want to hide so you don't get seen.

290
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:46,460
Scott: They keep moving though.

291
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:47,549
Scott: So it's very hard.

292
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:52,870
Scott: You got to predict where they're gonna be where they're gonna shine their light, right and there isn't always an option.

293
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,182
Scott: It's like they'll just trap you and it's not simple to just avoid them.

294
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,190
Rym: I totally hate that guy, right?

295
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,854
Scott: It's not simple to do.

296
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:04,449
Scott: you think this would be just like those Zelda games or you avoid the candidates that are you know?

297
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:09,306
Scott: You Know the parts like the candidates in the bush in the hedge maze.

298
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:16,870
Scott: Yeah, right It's not that simple, but you get some special vampire powers, but using your special vampire powers cost you life your hearts.

299
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:20,300
Scott: Drinking blood and doing other things can get you hearts back.

300
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:23,110
Scott: getting shot and holy watered makes you lose hearts.

301
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:29,559
Scott: so basically you just keep going level after level after level and The game isn't over till you lose your hundred hearts completely.

302
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:30,763
Scott: So it's all about.

303
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:36,650
Scott: you know, it's like it's like I can beat this level With only spending ten hearts, that's a pretty good deal, right?

304
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,920
Scott: But you know another level.

305
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,370
Scott: you need to gain ten hearts.

306
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:44,328
Scott: Otherwise in the long run if you keep doing that you're eventually on your way to losing.

307
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:50,570
Scott: so Pretty interesting game that has both the short term puzzle solving and also the long term resource management.

308
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:54,604
Scott: It's good when you're at work on your board much better than finding Pokemon at Google Maps.

309
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:55,748
Rym: I'm playing it right now.

310
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:56,270
Rym: It's super fun.

311
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,477
Rym: I totally just bit that guy again.

312
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,429
Rym: Oh, yeah, but I'm killing him.

313
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:00,153
Rym: Yeah He's dead.

314
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:02,685
Rym: kill that other guy too cuz he just walked up and didn't notice.

315
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:08,668
Rym: Yeah Killing all these guys up that fucker saw me fuck fuck.

316
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,337
Scott: Okay Going down in the moment.

317
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:12,702
Rym: The book club book is wool.

318
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:13,504
Rym: We both finished it.

319
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:15,150
Rym: do a show on it on Thursday.

320
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,964
Rym: It's alright, it's worth reading tight.

321
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,030
Rym: Yeah, I liked it.

322
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:25,510
Rym: I liked it way more than I liked captain fedora's penis adventure through the sex goddess lands of the kung fu sex masters.

323
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,760
Scott: I liked it more than ready player one.

324
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,770
Rym: I still gotta read ready player one.

325
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,940
Rym: Why do you have to up so I can shit all over it apparently?

326
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:34,766
Scott: Well, I mean, it's not.

327
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:41,426
Scott: it's better than Captain penis nice guy, but it's basically captain woo game 80s nerdery.

328
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:45,657
Rym: Uh Yeah, I don't know if I can deal with that.

329
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:49,138
Rym: I I Enjoy apt references.

330
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,198
Rym: I'm increasingly tired of Very crass cash grab.

331
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,344
Rym: Hey, you remember Mario?

332
00:20:56,866 --> 00:21:02,589
Scott: I to remember Mario This is more like do you remember tomb of horrors and pac-man?

333
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,547
Rym: With their powers combined you can be really insufferable to the people around you.

334
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:17,267
Rym: Yeah We're going to be at the penny arcade expo east not this weekend, but next weekend.

335
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:19,615
Rym: Whoa It's in Boston.

336
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,522
Scott: packs packs is just all the time.

337
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:23,308
Scott: now, it's like I was just out of packs and look at this.

338
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,963
Rym: another packs Yeah, and then I got another packs in October and then I got a packs right after.

339
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:29,994
Rym: well right before that in September Packs is everywhere.

340
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,580
Rym: Yeah, lots of packs.

341
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,269
Rym: Look at all these packs is we just keep going to them?

342
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:46,827
Rym: Not much else to say there had you were doing a panel called why no one will game with you And if you're not already attending bags, it's way too late to arrange attending packs.

343
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:47,830
Scott: No, right?

344
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:55,990
Rym: Unlike PAX Prime where you could have a pretty fun time being at PAX Prime without a badge and not doing any pack stuff.

345
00:21:56,672 --> 00:22:02,310
Rym: Not the same case for paxies if you don't have a badge stay don't go anywhere near Boston to stay home.

346
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,747
Scott: Yeah, unlike PAX East which you can't get into unless you're already in right?

347
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:13,770
Scott: There is something you can do next weekend the weekend before packs the moga festivals happen in New York City.

348
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:19,910
Scott: It seems to have been gone ever so slightly downhill There after year, but it's you know.

349
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:26,936
Scott: If you're that close to it as we are why not hop on the subway and go look at an independent comic show For an hour a few.

350
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:28,242
Rym: Yeah, we'll totally be there.

351
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:30,050
Rym: probably Saturday in the morning.

352
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,837
Scott: Yeah, probably Saturday morning when it opens.

353
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:34,346
Scott: get there when it opens outside the netrunner tournament on Sunday.

354
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,190
Scott: So definitely Saturday.

355
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:44,812
Rym: Yep, I'm also definitely I used to spend a lot more time at mocha But nowadays I kind of want to be in look at everything once buy everything I wanted to buy and then get the fuck out That's what

356
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:47,946
Scott: my plan is and then eat an awesome lunch nearby and then go home.

357
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:48,850
Rym: Are your parents coming?

358
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,621
Rym: No, so we can eat some more good.

359
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:55,946
Rym: Yeah We don't have to cater to the the whims of mom who's picky.

360
00:22:55,967 --> 00:23:02,685
Scott: No We can eat at the most exotic country restaurant the I don't know.

361
00:23:02,705 --> 00:23:03,146
Scott: I don't know.

362
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:13,538
Rym: I'll be kind of feeling a burger An ostrich burger, we're also going to be at a convention called Zank icon, it's April 25th 26 27th.

363
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:15,404
Scott: It's an anime con.

364
00:23:15,484 --> 00:23:20,641
Rym: We'll be doing mostly three Lectures there, I believe on Saturday and Sunday only.

365
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:22,889
Rym: I don't think the schedules public.

366
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:26,060
Rym: So show up and look for us on the schedule.

367
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,890
Rym: I think we're doing anime openers around the world.

368
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,258
Scott: You can just find the three panels that aren't Homestuck panels.

369
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,490
Scott: Yeah, or Hetalia panels, and you'll be all set.

370
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:40,276
Rym: I do have the schedule but I would think I think I would get in trouble with scojo if I just public because it's probably Not a hundred percent true.

371
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:45,883
Scott: Yeah, it's probably been much much changed Since the one the copy that you have.

372
00:23:46,044 --> 00:24:02,450
Rym: Yeah So we've talked about aspects of this multiple times on GeekNights over the years But usually as an aside or focusing really really tightly on one Tiny aspect of the greater picture of why it's so fucking hard to find people to play games.

373
00:24:02,835 --> 00:24:07,527
Scott: Yeah, well, I mean, you know We decided to do a PAX panel on this and then we couldn't come with an idea for today's show.

374
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:10,490
Scott: and it's like hey Let's kill like a hundred birds with one stone.

375
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,790
Scott: We'll sort of work through this panel that we've developing.

376
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:20,970
Scott: Literally, no one who is listening to this is going to not go to the panel at the actual packs because we made this episode.

377
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,301
Scott: 99.9% of the people listening this aren't even going to packs

378
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:36,609
Rym: plus the kinds of things I'll say on GeekNights Might be slightly different from the kinds of things I'll say at a Convention at which I'm a guest where there's a lot of video recorders and a lot of people physically in the room with me.

379
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:40,142
Rym: I mean, well that guy is gonna be in the audience.

380
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:40,904
Rym: I guarantee it.

381
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:50,661
Scott: also, you know people who might go and see us at the convention discover us might come and listen to this episode because they you know, People always look for videos of panels.

382
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:52,290
Scott: We did even though they saw the panel.

383
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:56,550
Scott: So hey, there's a podcast already on the website before the panel even happened.

384
00:24:57,013 --> 00:25:00,729
Scott: Maybe someone will come back and be like, you know Listen to it to remember what we said.

385
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:08,279
Rym: the other interesting thing is you guys will kind of get this insight if you see the panel and listen to this into Kind of after we've put a panel together.

386
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,684
Rym: I guess I hate saying panel.

387
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:22,064
Rym: I have to put a lecture like this together The way we talk to each other about like the finer points of what we're actually gonna say and how we'll like discard some ideas Or we decide that oh we were actually wrong about this thing.

388
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,370
Rym: We thought was part of our point.

389
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:27,030
Rym: Let's remove it now that we've talked about it at length, right?

390
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,240
Scott: Okay, so the panels call the lecture is called.

391
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,165
Scott: why no one will game with you?

392
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:31,270
Scott: because that's really provocative.

393
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:47,781
Scott: but really what it's about is How even though there's a bajillion billions of gamers on earth spending billions of hours on games Very very few of those actual people are people that any Individual person can game with right?

394
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:50,049
Scott: So I looked up some numbers, right?

395
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:55,730
Scott: Population of earth is like seven eight billion people right number of those people who play games.

396
00:25:55,851 --> 00:26:02,379
Scott: It's like pretty much almost anyone in a you know Country that has any sort of technology is playing some kind of game.

397
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,670
Scott: even people, you know, everyone's playing soccer somewhere pretty much, right?

398
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:14,731
Scott: Settlers of Catan has sold 15 million copies in the u.s That's a lot of copies It doesn't.

399
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:16,479
Scott: I don't think that counts the European copies.

400
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:18,869
Scott: No, that's a lot of settlers is out there.

401
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,053
Rym: That definitely is.

402
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,296
Scott: that's a ton right?

403
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:25,727
Scott: So with 15 million settlers is copies in the u.s.

404
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:32,830
Scott: In 50 states Assuming they're distributed like evenly per capita and you don't live in the complete sticks.

405
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:42,230
Scott: There's someone near you who has a copy of settlers besides you that you can play settlers with at least Right, and that's I mean, that's also a pretty niche number.

406
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:48,290
Rym: I mean settlers already assumes you've somehow gotten down the road of German slash euro game, right?

407
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:52,544
Scott: Yeah, so it's like it's even more dense than that, right and that doesn't count.

408
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:57,121
Scott: people who you know, maybe played You know, I mean munchkin might be more than settlers right.

409
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:58,124
Scott: there might be no magic.

410
00:26:58,144 --> 00:26:59,469
Scott: the gathering might be more than that.

411
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:04,968
Scott: So Anyway, so with all those games out there with games being so popular How come?

412
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,254
Scott: There is still so much LFG right, you know?

413
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:14,044
Scott: you go and you go to PAX a huge gaming convention.

414
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:16,813
Scott: people who are at PAX are LFG.

415
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:17,817
Scott: you go on the internet.

416
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:20,570
Scott: you think the internet would have solved all our LFG problems.

417
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:24,506
Scott: You go on the internet you find people who are LFG looking for game.

418
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:36,281
Rym: now on one hand of course the LFG is just a service because part of the whole reason you go to a convention is to meet strangers who you wouldn't otherwise Meet who have similar interests find someone to play a game with.

419
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:47,990
Rym: but yet despite the LFG space I see a lot of people walking around solo with the game Trying to muster up someone to play it trying to get someone to play with them trying to get someone to join the group.

420
00:27:49,013 --> 00:27:54,530
Scott: So why is it that at conventions and also not at conventions video games and non video games?

421
00:27:54,971 --> 00:28:04,036
Scott: Right with so many gamers and games of all kinds being so popular are people still struggling to find Someone else to game with?

422
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:07,630
Rym: why does every forum have the looking for a gaming group thread?

423
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,507
Rym: That's always forever and super long right usually filled with drama.

424
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:13,456
Scott: Yep So it's like you go.

425
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:21,123
Scott: I mean you go to the forums on board game geek for like netrunner Which has got a very active community online, and you see threads constantly.

426
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:29,010
Scott: any players in my area Cricket cricket anyone, but nope role-playing games are probably the biggest offender here.

427
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:33,950
Rym: Yes, not only is everyone desperate to find a gaming group, but they need to form a group.

428
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,298
Rym: they need to form like a regular group of people who are.

429
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:39,369
Rym: they're going to share a lot of time with playing these games.

430
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:49,860
Rym: and You think if so many people are into D&D Here they're not doing it this time anyway last year.

431
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,884
Rym: Yeah, so long.

432
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:59,730
Scott: yeah anyway, so Reason number one take that huge group right that big old circle and can you know the big old pie that consists of all gamers?

433
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,211
Scott: on Earth.

434
00:29:00,974 --> 00:29:05,530
Scott: and the number one thing that is going to remove that pie from the ability for you to eat.

435
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,818
Scott: It is just geography right.

436
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,929
Scott: most of those people do not live anywhere near you.

437
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:13,037
Scott: It's like you you play.

438
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:14,683
Scott: I don't know Monopoly.

439
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:15,004
Scott: Okay.

440
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:16,550
Scott: You'll find someone near you to play Monopoly.

441
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,683
Rym: me I mean parents your kids sure the neighbor kids.

442
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,350
Scott: you're into race for the galaxy.

443
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:25,724
Scott: How many people physically near you wherever you live play race of the galaxy?

444
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,630
Scott: if you live in a city like New York, okay?

445
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,676
Scott: You'll find someone right.

446
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:35,610
Scott: you live in even my hometown Trumble in the suburbs of Connecticut right an hour away by car.

447
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,990
Scott: Good luck fine.

448
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,295
Rym: Well remember we lived in beacon.

449
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:38,436
Rym: you're

450
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:48,849
Scott: gonna have to take a car if you live if I lived it with my parents and I wanted to find people to game with I would have to get in a car and drive at least a half hour to an hour to Get to a place where people might be playing games.

451
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:52,345
Rym: We used to live in Beacon, New York, and there was the city of Beacon.

452
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:53,290
Rym: website is down.

453
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:54,656
Rym: Okay, I went to it.

454
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:55,801
Rym: look how many pipe people are there?

455
00:29:56,303 --> 00:30:00,560
Rym: so it's got a population of like 15,000. it's in the orbit of New York City.

456
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,892
Rym: a lot of people like us used to live there or do live there and commute Down.

457
00:30:04,456 --> 00:30:05,201
Rym: Scott and I were looking for

458
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:08,457
Scott: definitely nerds there Yeah of different kinds for

459
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:25,692
Rym: the nearest gaming store was like a half-hour drive north in Poughkeepsie And at that gaming store there was a one gaming club that consisted of a very small number of kind of sad older gamers That was not expanding or growing in any way most of whom did not want to play the kinds of games We wanted to play.

460
00:30:25,773 --> 00:30:30,409
Scott: and there were a few gamers at a near at that College nearby, and that was pretty much it.

461
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:40,143
Scott: Yep, and the college was also up near that gets that same gaming store, so Geography is the big problem for tabletop games, but what about video games?

462
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:42,450
Scott: you think internet should solve all these geography problems?

463
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,697
Scott: I can just play with anyone in the whole world.

464
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:45,560
Scott: You know games.

465
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,422
Scott: It'll be no problem.

466
00:30:46,442 --> 00:30:46,663
Scott: Well.

467
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:54,310
Scott: That's true for some Video games mostly the a simp the asynchronous ones right like play by mail situations.

468
00:30:54,531 --> 00:30:59,190
Scott: Yeah, some play boss at five right, but that's not the kind of thing that can really you know.

469
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:04,830
Scott: It's like those games are great, but that's not the kind of thing you can sit down and play for hours, right?

470
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,509
Scott: That's only the kind of thing that you can you know sort of occupy random moments throughout your day.

471
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:17,202
Scott: You're not gonna You know my friend in Finland isn't gonna sit down for three hours at the same time as me To play the game turn by turn.

472
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:27,872
Scott: why time zones Time zones, I'm only limited to people in my longitude Right or pretty close to my longitude in terms of that kind of gaming Right.

473
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:39,830
Scott: something that can actually occupy a good chunk of time has to be people nearby even just from you at from New York to California Causes a significant problems in the time difference and not just latency, but latency is the most obvious example of it.

474
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,455
Rym: But just reliability do you know?

475
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:45,770
Rym: many times I've tried to play a game of Civ 5 with someone who's overseas where latency?

476
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,572
Rym: We don't care.

477
00:31:47,054 --> 00:31:48,598
Rym: We've sorted out the timezone thing.

478
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:52,790
Rym: the game just fucking stops working occasionally because of bad network connections, right?

479
00:31:52,910 --> 00:32:01,130
Rym: It's you know the internet while or because Scott Johnson Yeah, it's hosting the game as a computer like locks up the internet right for an asynchronous game.

480
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:03,159
Scott: Technologically isn't gonna give you a problem.

481
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:16,117
Scott: the timezone gives you a problem but for Technology wise the latency prevents you from playing any kind of real-time game any kind of counter-strike any kind of fighting game any kind of anything that's real-time and even things that aren't real-time.

482
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:19,649
Scott: you still need the connection to be very reliable so it doesn't disconnect.

483
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:26,095
Scott: and When you're farther away from someone and their internet is garbage in the US internet is garbage And it's just.

484
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:27,000
Scott: you know you can't.

485
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:28,530
Scott: so you're still looking for game.

486
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,190
Scott: You can't find the game because all the you know you have to basically subtract from the pie.

487
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:34,236
Scott: All the people were far away from you.

488
00:32:34,457 --> 00:32:38,650
Scott: Oh and by the way, maybe you do find someone who is in your longitude.

489
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:40,937
Scott: They don't speak the same language as you.

490
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:49,030
Scott: not as much of a concern for us in the North am no But you know this can be a serious problem for other people like what if you live in Arizona?

491
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:51,177
Scott: And it's just these tons of Mexican gamers.

492
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:52,181
Scott: You just can't play with them.

493
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:53,425
Rym: actually what's funny.

494
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:54,549
Rym: It depends on the game.

495
00:32:55,474 --> 00:33:01,910
Rym: One of the things board game being does and a lot of Euro gamers Do is one of the statistics about a board game is how language dependent?

496
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:07,747
Rym: It is either because you might play with people who don't speak the same language or the rules themselves.

497
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:13,669
Rym: like the game itself You may or may not need to know the language the game was published in to be able to play it.

498
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,834
Rym: Yeah, like settlers.

499
00:33:14,854 --> 00:33:15,919
Rym: There's not a lot of words.

500
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:16,703
Rym: You can play that.

501
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:18,189
Scott: what if you had to bargain with someone?

502
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:24,530
Rym: Ah, but you could still you've got the icons alone could be sufficient to get your point across.

503
00:33:25,332 --> 00:33:26,255
Rym: Or like counter-strike.

504
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:29,688
Rym: I would regularly in beacon play counter-strike with all these quebecois people.

505
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,254
Rym: Mm-hmm So they'd all speak French.

506
00:33:31,857 --> 00:33:32,319
Rym: We didn't really.

507
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:42,765
Rym: we weren't able to communicate with each other Effectively except via the radio commands because if I said something they didn't really understand me and vice versa or if they did understand me They pretended they didn't.

508
00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:54,310
Rym: So some games like a game that doesn't require a heavy amount of team coordination That is otherwise versus or lone wolf in some way you can play just fine.

509
00:33:54,430 --> 00:34:06,375
Rym: But games like that like counter-strike unless you're playing for the purposes of that group that Community that thing that people are always saying they want in these forum threads Then that doesn't work.

510
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:12,382
Rym: those you're those people you're playing against might as well be advanced a eyes and Europeans can have a lot of trouble with this as well.

511
00:34:12,646 --> 00:34:16,962
Scott: also Australians might have a lot of other Pacific countries to play with right.

512
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,650
Scott: but it's like if you don't speak Chinese or who knows what?

513
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,175
Scott: You know language right.

514
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:25,730
Scott: or maybe if you live in like Southeast Asia, right you live in Thailand you speak Thai.

515
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:30,150
Scott: You can play with Thai people right, but you're gonna have all these, you know people who speak.

516
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,230
Scott: You know some kind of Chinese that are near you, but you can't game with them if you don't speak that language.

517
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,353
Rym: So that's already.

518
00:34:36,393 --> 00:34:45,750
Rym: we come down to the idea the sort of side point that I hadn't really thought about with these slides before That it really depends on the kind of game and what you're looking for.

519
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:53,650
Rym: If you're just looking for bodies to play a game like I'm playing counter-strike I want humans to be playing with me, but we're all reasonably good at the game.

520
00:34:54,670 --> 00:35:00,150
Rym: Bots like good bots would probably be fine as would pretty much any humans who are good at the game.

521
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,738
Rym: But I'm not gonna form lasting friendships.

522
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:04,885
Rym: I'll play with whoever's online at the time.

523
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,410
Rym: I'll click on the matchmaking.

524
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:14,610
Rym: Constantly clicking on matchmaking will very rarely net you a group with which to have a long term or meaningful gaming group.

525
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:17,850
Scott: The point is is that whatever kind of game you're playing it doesn't matter.

526
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:27,462
Scott: Geography is going to limit the number of people that you can play with in some dramatic way more dramatic than any other factor Right, so that's reason number one.

527
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:29,270
Scott: There's billions of people on earth playing games.

528
00:35:30,872 --> 00:35:34,330
Scott: Over 90% of them are eliminated just because they don't live near you, right?

529
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,980
Scott: Okay, so what other kind of problems right besides?

530
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,970
Scott: geography will sort of reduce the number of people that you can game with?

531
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:47,169
Scott: Right, well the people themselves obviously, right?

532
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,303
Scott: I found someone near me who also self-identifies as gamer.

533
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:53,090
Scott: that is incredibly broad.

534
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:56,310
Scott: I play tabletop euro games and they play Starcraft.

535
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:57,738
Rym: This is where you.

536
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:59,428
Rym: this isn't gonna worry that sort of.

537
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,121
Rym: you know The idea of the fake gamer a lot of it.

538
00:36:02,301 --> 00:36:03,266
Rym: Oh that person just a fake.

539
00:36:03,306 --> 00:36:04,150
Rym: same thing in comic books.

540
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,614
Rym: Oh, they're a fake geek.

541
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:06,738
Rym: They're not a real geek.

542
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:08,082
Rym: They're not a real gamer.

543
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:20,221
Scott: They don't play counter-strike 1-6 only If someone doesn't play the same game as you or doesn't want to play the same game you want to play then you're not gonna Be able to play games together unless someone changes their mind which.

544
00:36:20,241 --> 00:36:24,880
Rym: so you have the shared culture of gamer But you don't have a shared culture of game.

545
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,503
Rym: Mm-hmm.

546
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:26,948
Rym: That's the tagline for that bit.

547
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:28,213
Rym: right there I mean culture.

548
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:29,237
Rym: I'm adding that to the slide.

549
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,410
Scott: Yeah, it's like you have to be playing not only the same.

550
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,386
Scott: I mean what if it's even the same genre?

551
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:37,982
Scott: I'm a Starcraft I'm a street fighter guy and who do you meet on the street?

552
00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:39,126
Scott: You met a Marvel vs.

553
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:39,909
Scott: Capcom guy.

554
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:44,230
Scott: Well, I guess you're not playing any fighting games together cuz right.

555
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:45,796
Scott: I mean sure fighting game.

556
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:47,944
Scott: people tend to play more than one fighting game, right?

557
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:48,988
Scott: So meet you might.

558
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:50,958
Rym: they're not forget They're not gonna play settlers with me.

559
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,088
Scott: That's maybe not or maybe they will.

560
00:36:54,151 --> 00:37:00,270
Scott: But you know people the number, you know people like us have a like a broad variety of games we play, right?

561
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:04,790
Scott: But you know, they're only gonna get heavily involved in a few games.

562
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,770
Scott: And if you're gonna you're looking for game like just a single game.

563
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:12,530
Scott: You're looking for game long-lasting game, like, you know some sort of regular gaming deal.

564
00:37:13,052 --> 00:37:20,530
Scott: You're gonna need to find people who are very very compatible in terms of what games they play Not down just to the genre of game.

565
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:26,370
Scott: I'm an RTS player looking for RTS players not just be I'm a. I play dota and they play League of Legends.

566
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,381
Scott: Nope, we got to get all in the same page.

567
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:30,110
Scott: here has to be the same game, right?

568
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,761
Scott: But they had to be the same kind of gamer.

569
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:37,909
Scott: So I play League of Legends you play League of Legends All right, this is gonna work out, isn't it?

570
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:43,990
Scott: No, cuz I play it hardcore to win Like I'm trying to be pro and you're just playing it like la la la la la.

571
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,327
Rym: Remember when heroes of new earth came out and it.

572
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:52,662
Rym: you know We did a show on this about how that was literally the most toxic gaming community I had ever encountered in my life.

573
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:53,890
Rym: up to that point to this.

574
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,470
Rym: I'm someone who's played a lot of fucking counter-strike, right?

575
00:37:57,051 --> 00:38:05,942
Rym: And the reason for that was simple half the people playing were new to the genre not good at the genre Wanting to play this game wanting to enjoy it.

576
00:38:06,263 --> 00:38:09,483
Rym: they were playing mostly for fun They were trying to win but they weren't super serious about it.

577
00:38:09,784 --> 00:38:13,097
Rym: The other half of the people Literally wanted to win at all costs.

578
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:15,184
Rym: That was the only reason they're even clicking.

579
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:16,047
Rym: Is that ranking?

580
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:16,389
Rym: Mm-hmm.

581
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:21,150
Rym: So those two kinds of people cannot coexist on the same server.

582
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,177
Rym: They cannot coexist in the same game.

583
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:28,517
Rym: if I'm playing El Grande to win and you're playing because you like the color yellow And you want to have the most yellow cubes on the board.

584
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:30,687
Rym: We're not gonna have a good time.

585
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:36,810
Scott: No Another problem is that a lot of times the game you want to play is a dead game, right?

586
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,936
Rym: I'm - I think here we tell the Story of tribes - right.

587
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:43,705
Rym: Oh did I'll tell the full anecdote of knit hog.

588
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:44,347
Rym: Sure.

589
00:38:44,387 --> 00:38:45,390
Rym: That's recent, right?

590
00:38:45,651 --> 00:38:48,901
Scott: The point is though It's like you might differ on what genre you want to play.

591
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:50,870
Scott: you might differ on what game you want to play.

592
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:52,858
Scott: You also might want to play a game.

593
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,586
Scott: That is a dead game, right?

594
00:38:55,249 --> 00:39:00,730
Scott: So Really now we're really limited in who's left to play games with right?

595
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:10,244
Rym: Literally chased every single human being out of the matchmaking system on knit hog on multiple occasions And now there's never anyone there, right?

596
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,756
Scott: Well, that's the air hockey problem We've talked about many times right?

597
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:13,398
Scott: is you're?

598
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:19,321
Scott: let's say you get really good at Street Fighter and you have friends who do also want To play Street Fighter and you all want to play to win you.

599
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:20,866
Scott: all the same attitude about the game.

600
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:21,790
Scott: It's looking good.

601
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:29,140
Scott: It's looking good here But you're just way better than them because you've played it more and they just lose to you And now they don't like to play against you.

602
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,292
Rym: just saw this so quickly with knit hog Scott.

603
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:32,458
Rym: I both got the game at the same time.

604
00:39:32,478 --> 00:39:34,450
Rym: We're like, oh, let's stream us playing it together.

605
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:40,310
Rym: I played it for like six hours the night before we actually played against each other.

606
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:42,257
Rym: I did not played at all as a result.

607
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:43,763
Rym: I was literally invincible.

608
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:44,345
Scott: Yep.

609
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:44,827
Rym: It was just.

610
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:47,006
Rym: I win I win I win I win I win.

611
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:56,710
Scott: It's like I might really like playing basketball and be kind of good at it but playing against Michael Jordan be boring as fuck because he just be like Don't go over your head and don't go over yet and steal the ball and dunk over your head.

612
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,593
Rym: Don't get us wrong.

613
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:01,664
Rym: Some people can really enjoy the teaching game.

614
00:40:01,744 --> 00:40:04,596
Rym: Like I'm super good at settler You're not gonna learn anything.

615
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,023
Scott: If you don't even get to handle the ball.

616
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:07,310
Scott: You just constantly steals and dunks.

617
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,455
Scott: What can I learn for that?

618
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:11,930
Scott: Nothing, but I would never be able to in the time that we were there playing.

619
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:13,316
Rym: No, but I'm saying me.

620
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:23,230
Rym: I don't enjoy playing settlers of Catan as a game No But I do enjoy playing it as a tool to teach other people how to be good at games.

621
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:27,067
Rym: I will play any game of settlers and I won't be playing.

622
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:29,037
Rym: I'll be playing to win Like I'll win in the end just cuz I don't.

623
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:30,987
Rym: I don't like losing pride.

624
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:32,892
Rym: I won't Try.

625
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,902
Rym: I won't play hardcore to win.

626
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:36,470
Rym: I'll give people a lot of advice.

627
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:40,004
Rym: I'll make a mistake and then say so notice how I traded that wood there.

628
00:40:40,044 --> 00:40:41,189
Rym: I really shouldn't have done that.

629
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:42,315
Rym: now He's ahead by a point.

630
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:43,199
Rym: You wouldn't ahead before.

631
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,566
Rym: I didn't really need that wood.

632
00:40:44,606 --> 00:40:45,209
Rym: What did it get me?

633
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,321
Rym: I'll do things like that and I enjoyed that experience.

634
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:50,550
Rym: but already, you know, we always talk about game theory.

635
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:51,679
Rym: I have a different utility.

636
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,029
Rym: I'm not playing to win the game.

637
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:58,090
Rym: I'm the teacher playing with a bunch of students here, but that's not a long-term game.

638
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:15,814
Scott: But if your skill level of games is generally higher, right, you know You you need to find people if you want long-term gaming if you find people at the same skill level right or at least relatively the same skill level as you or Building their skills from the low level quickly up to the high level so that it's enjoyable for you to play with them and them To play with you.

639
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:17,222
Rym: This is something that does.

640
00:41:17,263 --> 00:41:17,967
Rym: it's not just that.

641
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:18,490
Rym: it prevents you.

642
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:22,278
Rym: Like if I'm super good at air hockey I'll never even get to play air hockey with anyone.

643
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:27,070
Rym: or maybe I'll get one game with every individual human once Yeah, and then they'll never play with me again.

644
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,897
Rym: But this is the thing that say.

645
00:41:28,917 --> 00:41:30,744
Rym: you finally formed a gaming group.

646
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:32,350
Rym: You got your eight friends together.

647
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:36,390
Rym: You all got really into Super Street Fighter 2, whatever.

648
00:41:37,153 --> 00:41:38,057
Rym: So you're all playing.

649
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,770
Rym: you have this sort of semi like some of you are better some of you than worse.

650
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:49,570
Rym: but as soon as one person Practices a little bit and gets the air hockey up just a little bit the gaming group gets destroyed overnight.

651
00:41:50,192 --> 00:41:57,383
Rym: You destroy the the rare functional gaming group you have just by getting better than your friends Mm-hmm.

652
00:41:57,871 --> 00:42:04,558
Scott: And then what ends up happening is you have to move into the competitive community and find those other high-level peoples But they're probably better than you.

653
00:42:04,578 --> 00:42:06,005
Scott: So now what do you do?

654
00:42:06,246 --> 00:42:07,010
Rym: Yep now you either.

655
00:42:07,451 --> 00:42:15,058
Scott: You either go by yourself into your bedroom and level yourself the fuck up so you can be a competitive champion Or you stop playing that game.

656
00:42:15,098 --> 00:42:17,809
Rym: like look Scott and I crazy fucking good at air hockey.

657
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:21,210
Rym: anyone We know most people in New York will just beat him hands down.

658
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:25,690
Rym: But if we go to an air hockey tournament like the national championships, let's just get smoked.

659
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,617
Rym: We would literally would.

660
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:28,410
Scott: they would not even score a goal.

661
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:39,309
Rym: Yeah, the puck would fly and break our hand, but there's no one in between those two levels for us to play except each other Unless someone else wants to be that kind of gamer with us.

662
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:43,110
Rym: We've had a lot of luck in getting people to be that kind of gamer with us in air hockey.

663
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:44,963
Scott: So none at all.

664
00:42:45,124 --> 00:42:45,990
Scott: zero right.

665
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:49,164
Scott: Another thing that is that is sad but true.

666
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:50,827
Scott: Is that a difference of money?

667
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:51,648
Scott: right?

668
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:56,763
Scott: an economic well-being Financial well-being does separate gamers, right?

669
00:42:57,184 --> 00:42:58,850
Scott: It's it's just the reality of the world.

670
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,557
Scott: It sucks, but it's there.

671
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:02,283
Scott: I found someone near me.

672
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:03,990
Scott: We're gonna play PC games.

673
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,200
Scott: They can't afford a PC gaming rig that's good enough to play the game.

674
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:08,985
Scott: They just can't right.

675
00:43:09,246 --> 00:43:10,690
Scott: I've met a lot of people online.

676
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,530
Scott: They're just like my computer sucks.

677
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:15,941
Scott: I can't play that game with you because my video card is no good.

678
00:43:16,342 --> 00:43:19,332
Rym: or even what about the people who just like we're all It packs?

679
00:43:20,095 --> 00:43:22,023
Rym: a lot of people can't afford to come to packs.

680
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:23,670
Rym: Yeah, people don't live near packs.

681
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,614
Scott: We are gonna pegs.

682
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:30,578
Scott: anyone who's at who's can afford to go to a convention is either lucky the convention is near their home right.

683
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:39,547
Scott: lucky to even get a badge if they have the money or Lucky that they are well off money wise they can afford the hotel and travel and etc.

684
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:40,009
Scott: Etc.

685
00:43:40,189 --> 00:43:40,390
Scott: Right?

686
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:43,378
Scott: So there's we said there's bajillions of gamers.

687
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:56,890
Scott: only a lucky very small percentage can go to any kind of gaming convention Especially a big one like packs yep and I'll say from my Many years ago into PAX Prime and PAX East and a lot of other conventions or even a Gen Con or anything else.

688
00:43:57,031 --> 00:44:08,386
Rym: It is obvious that the the average demographic of the people who go to PAX Prime in Seattle is Way more affluent than the people who attend most other gaming type conventions or other fan conventions.

689
00:44:08,948 --> 00:44:09,710
Rym: That's just how it is.

690
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,441
Scott: So it's not that packs is like discriminating.

691
00:44:12,502 --> 00:44:13,486
Scott: We don't like poor people.

692
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:14,370
Scott: poor people get out.

693
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,126
Rym: In fact, they actually do everything they can to give everyone a fair shot.

694
00:44:17,146 --> 00:44:18,211
Scott: They try to you know They keep.

695
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:20,700
Scott: they don't sell VIP badges like other cons.

696
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,470
Scott: They don't charge for individual events like other cons, right?

697
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,378
Scott: They try to do everything to be as you know You know equal as possible.

698
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:35,510
Scott: money cannot get you privileges once you're at packs But you still need to be privileged with enough money to get over the bar to get into packs.

699
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:51,277
Rym: And this I think is why this problem of looking for games seems so apparent primarily in small towns and on internet communities Because the people who aren't complaining are the people who go to a million conventions and they get their gaming fix Here at packs.

700
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:52,102
Rym: I keep saying here.

701
00:44:52,142 --> 00:44:53,108
Rym: We're sitting in Queens, right?

702
00:44:53,979 --> 00:44:55,654
Rym: I Can I have my pick.

703
00:44:55,875 --> 00:45:01,130
Rym: I can play a lot of games with strangers that I cannot play in my daily life even in New York.

704
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,556
Rym: Right and I go to.

705
00:45:02,676 --> 00:45:06,515
Rym: you know, four or so packs is a year never mind all the other gaming cons I go to.

706
00:45:06,899 --> 00:45:12,009
Rym: so every month or two I'm at a convention for an entire weekend playing as many fucking games as I can.

707
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:15,949
Rym: It clips at 3 in the morning and then start another game as soon as we finish the first one.

708
00:45:16,311 --> 00:45:18,542
Scott: Few gamers are as lucky as that.

709
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,330
Rym: so everyone in this room already.

710
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,541
Rym: You have a huge advantage over almost every other gamer.

711
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:26,230
Scott: and it's not just you know, PC games and conventions.

712
00:45:26,652 --> 00:45:28,322
Scott: What if you want to play Magic the Gathering?

713
00:45:28,483 --> 00:45:29,670
Scott: that shit is expensive.

714
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:30,777
Scott: What are you gonna play Warhammer?

715
00:45:30,837 --> 00:45:32,970
Scott: that shit is double expensive, right?

716
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:36,187
Scott: It's like some games no matter how bad that you want to play.

717
00:45:36,227 --> 00:45:41,610
Scott: them are Expensive as games and you can't play them unless you have mad moneys, right?

718
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:46,283
Scott: They're all you know, even a cheaper game right like Puerto Rico.

719
00:45:46,303 --> 00:45:48,589
Scott: It's 40 bucks for a copy of Puerto Rico.

720
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:49,937
Rym: It's not a 40 bucks.

721
00:45:49,977 --> 00:45:51,225
Rym: If you're lucky I paid.

722
00:45:51,245 --> 00:45:55,001
Rym: I paid $90 for a copy of la cheetah.

723
00:45:55,382 --> 00:45:56,125
Rym: I got it on sale.

724
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:57,168
Rym: It's way more expensive now.

725
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,613
Scott: Well, that was a Print game.

726
00:45:58,633 --> 00:45:58,834
Rym: Yes.

727
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:03,770
Scott: I played that fucking game once right and it's like, okay, you're into board games.

728
00:46:04,273 --> 00:46:05,399
Scott: I mean 40 bucks.

729
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:07,049
Scott: That's like you buy one game.

730
00:46:07,972 --> 00:46:11,350
Scott: Usually you need a board game library If you want to play board games regularly.

731
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:15,270
Scott: You'll get bored playing settlers over and over and over and over again, right board game library.

732
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:18,090
Scott: Suddenly we're into the area of hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

733
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:20,685
Scott: It's like you can't game if you don't have this.

734
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:28,029
Rym: also I think is you know I don't want to stress it a lot because we're talking about the reality of like these sort of objective hard reasons Why this is so hard.

735
00:46:28,592 --> 00:46:34,610
Rym: But there's a lot of drama in the communities around people trying to form gaming groups a lot of like.

736
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:35,798
Rym: I don't want to play with that guy.

737
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:37,570
Rym: Oh, I gotta go to so-and-so's house.

738
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:41,481
Rym: I don't want to really play race for the galaxy, but that's all.

739
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:44,550
Rym: Joey Jojo will play and he's the one who owns all the games.

740
00:46:45,353 --> 00:46:57,738
Rym: Well yet what I see in a lot of gaming communities is that there's a few linchpin people Who for whatever reason either because they're rich or because like board games or video games are their thing that they buy everything To the extent to the exclusion of other things.

741
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,790
Rym: There's the few people who have all the games.

742
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:10,530
Rym: So the gaming groups that do form in those areas form around those people Which is great if you're friends with those people or you can be friends with those people.

743
00:47:10,991 --> 00:47:15,610
Rym: But it causes drama when you don't like the people who own the games.

744
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:19,910
Rym: You'd like to play the games with the other people, but the other people also don't own the games, right?

745
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,037
Scott: Well, it has this weird power dynamic.

746
00:47:22,098 --> 00:47:23,001
Scott: Well, it also.

747
00:47:23,282 --> 00:47:23,964
Scott: it depends right?

748
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:25,490
Scott: it shows people's priorities, right?

749
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:27,889
Scott: Like you might know some people who play games.

750
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:35,490
Scott: Games aren't their number one thing in life But they play some games and they will go and game with that guy who owns all the crazy games.

751
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:40,450
Scott: They'll go to his house or her house once in a while play some games, but it's not their major thing.

752
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,877
Scott: They're not so hooked on games.

753
00:47:41,937 --> 00:47:44,730
Scott: It's sort of like, you know a nice aside for them, right?

754
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,690
Scott: I mean you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who didn't play a game once in a while, right?

755
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:56,490
Scott: But since it's not their primary thing, they're not LFG They're not going on the internet looking for that thread saying who's playing this game in this area.

756
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,444
Rym: They'll show their not invention and binge for three days on games.

757
00:47:59,524 --> 00:48:00,750
Scott: Well, they even go to a convention.

758
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,367
Scott: It's like such a low priority for them.

759
00:48:02,407 --> 00:48:02,893
Scott: gaming They're.

760
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:03,198
Scott: so.

761
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:08,870
Scott: you know It's such a look at a lot of it's so less important than their family their job and their other hobbies.

762
00:48:09,272 --> 00:48:12,210
Scott: But they do it once in a while, but you cannot find this person.

763
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:16,330
Scott: You cannot get them to regularly commit to spending a lot of time playing games with you.

764
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:20,609
Scott: That's just not a thing that they're interested in, you know, so even though they're a gamer, right?

765
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,136
Scott: They're part of the pie of Potential people to game with.

766
00:48:24,497 --> 00:48:28,010
Scott: they're just not into it as much right as much as you are who wants to game.

767
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,561
Scott: You know weekly or twice monthly or whatever.

768
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,570
Rym: now there is already and we'll talk more at the end.

769
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,782
Rym: I think about ways ways to mitigate these issues.

770
00:48:34,823 --> 00:48:37,929
Rym: the way around that problem Is that if you're committed to it?

771
00:48:38,311 --> 00:48:46,450
Rym: You have to be that person who has a lot of the games and you have to be the one who does all this work To organize game nights to where you need like a 10 to 1 ratio.

772
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:49,003
Rym: You need 10 people who like games.

773
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:53,869
Rym: for every one Average person you'll get to attend your game night to play a game.

774
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:54,290
Scott: Yeah.

775
00:48:54,532 --> 00:49:00,386
Rym: So if you know 40 people who kind of like games Then you can reliably get four of them to show up once a week and play settlers with you.

776
00:49:00,908 --> 00:49:06,548
Scott: another thing That's kind of small small but significant right is the age of the gamers.

777
00:49:06,629 --> 00:49:07,732
Scott: right now You shouldn't.

778
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:15,930
Scott: I mean nobody's discriminating at least no one that I know is discriminating in terms of you know Race creed gender whatever in terms of who they're gaming with.

779
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,650
Scott: They just want someone who's gonna play the game and they don't give a shit what color height or whatever they are.

780
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:22,696
Scott: But age can matter a lot.

781
00:49:22,736 --> 00:49:27,858
Scott: if you are into the Pokemon trading card game and you show up at some elementary school Tournament right.

782
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:31,445
Scott: if you're you into yugioh Which is perfectly okay for anyone to be into you.

783
00:49:31,465 --> 00:49:36,041
Scott: if you want to be Right, you can show up at a tournament at a game store and play against.

784
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:43,845
Scott: you know, ten-year-olds and I guess that's okay a Little bit, okay, but you can't be hanging out with them at like a meetup.

785
00:49:43,885 --> 00:49:47,945
Scott: You can't be having them over your house You can't really be befriending them when you're 30 40 year old person.

786
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:52,590
Scott: That is just kind of not cool and has a lot of issues.

787
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:59,510
Rym: Well, even if it is a hundred percent cool It doesn't matter because guys we live in a society where appearances matter or at least appearances affect you.

788
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:00,634
Scott: Right if you're that?

789
00:50:00,895 --> 00:50:06,115
Rym: if you show up at an elementary school Pokemon meetup and you're 40 It's not gonna work.

790
00:50:06,356 --> 00:50:07,522
Scott: It goes the other way too.

791
00:50:07,764 --> 00:50:08,970
Scott: You're a nerdy kid in high school.

792
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:12,470
Scott: There's two other nerdy kids in your high school that you do stuff with but you need more.

793
00:50:12,892 --> 00:50:16,850
Scott: The only other nerds in town are like these old dudes who game at the game shop.

794
00:50:17,331 --> 00:50:19,075
Scott: You can't really get mixed up with them.

795
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:29,620
Rym: It's not gonna work out right because it's just it just isn't even though that sort of like mentored novice Relationship seems to have been a very common way.

796
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,290
Rym: people got into role-playing games for many many years.

797
00:50:32,551 --> 00:50:46,534
Rym: I mean I would go to conventions like Michigan when I was in late middle school Even mid middle school and I'd show up and I joined a D&D game and most other people in that game were 30 40 50 And it worked totally fine.

798
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:49,783
Rym: Yeah, but again at a convention right?

799
00:50:49,863 --> 00:51:02,021
Scott: not like going to their house if you have a significant Difference of age with the people that you can find there are only certain situations where it'll be socially appropriate To game with them and most of the time it won't be.

800
00:51:02,162 --> 00:51:09,430
Rym: and even if you ignore the social thing or the social thing Is fine, I mean a lot of times it can be fine like parents meet and then the parents and kids have multiple families.

801
00:51:09,551 --> 00:51:11,117
Scott: Or maybe it's your friend's dad.

802
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:15,936
Scott: You're in high school and you have a friend in high school and his dad is The crazy gamer guy.

803
00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:18,710
Scott: it's like oh well that you know, that's a relationship that can work out.

804
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,616
Rym: You know the modern era.

805
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:24,910
Rym: if you're into magic and your dad comes down to play He's probably got all these old like mocks emeralds and black lotuses, right?

806
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,750
Scott: You know, that's that's an appropriate situation.

807
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:29,500
Rym: But there's also the problem of the kid brain.

808
00:51:30,022 --> 00:51:34,429
Rym: the science shows below certain ages Like there's milestones of development in kids.

809
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:39,426
Rym: We played a really good game of Hanabi with two pretty young kids at anime Boston.

810
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,704
Rym: Yeah, not that long ago It was a fun game, but you know what and they were smart.

811
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:43,510
Rym: They did really well.

812
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:46,541
Scott: They were you know smart kids compared to other kids.

813
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:50,073
Scott: They were above average and smartness for kids their age They were still kids.

814
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:55,470
Rym: some kids just aren't at the level yet where they understand what a role-playing game even is.

815
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:56,714
Rym: Like they just don't get it.

816
00:51:56,734 --> 00:52:01,228
Rym: Yeah, so the age difference will limit the amount of complexity you grab.

817
00:52:01,248 --> 00:52:02,030
Scott: grab a board game.

818
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:06,330
Scott: What does it say on the side ages X and up ages X to X, right?

819
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:16,929
Scott: if you are in a different age range different games might just be skill level far away from you or Because of your age you just can't have a skill level any higher, right?

820
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:17,671
Scott: It's it.

821
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:21,850
Scott: you'll see some prodigies, of course, right, but you know you go to a netrunner tournament.

822
00:52:22,632 --> 00:52:23,114
Scott: No one.

823
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:25,320
Scott: there is under 20 something.

824
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,266
Rym: everyone's between the ages of 25 and 35, right?

825
00:52:29,353 --> 00:52:33,370
Scott: The World Championships those like one kid in like Tiago and he was a legend, right?

826
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:42,102
Scott: It's it's a complicated game that like a kid even a high school kid that have a hard time You know playing netrunner and seriously now, it's not an easy game.

827
00:52:42,664 --> 00:52:46,110
Scott: age is a factor and chess tournaments They have age groups, right?

828
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:50,423
Scott: You know, you know the eight-year-old doesn't get to play against the grandmasters and whatever.

829
00:52:50,443 --> 00:52:57,030
Rym: now age is a factor but Similar to or at least related to age is the social set of the person.

830
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:09,790
Rym: I mean when I play games with my adult friends we say fuck a lot Mmm, but a lot, you know, the game itself is one thing But you have to get along with the people you're playing games with even though most of you out there.

831
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,830
Rym: So easy for us to fall into our like the way we do panels when we get into this format.

832
00:53:14,951 --> 00:53:16,990
Rym: But I'm even like pointing at the monitor.

833
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:18,649
Scott: You're the only one doing it.

834
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:20,540
Rym: Yeah, but you're you're speaking the same way.

835
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,390
Rym: you speak on a panel instead of let what we do on the show.

836
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:22,832
Rym: It's fun.

837
00:53:23,094 --> 00:53:23,496
Scott: slides.

838
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,523
Rym: Yeah, I have slides.

839
00:53:24,543 --> 00:53:25,066
Rym: So I'm looking at them.

840
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:25,609
Rym: They're all blank.

841
00:53:26,692 --> 00:53:27,356
Scott: Get some pictures.

842
00:53:27,397 --> 00:53:28,585
Scott: these aren't easy to get pictures for.

843
00:53:28,645 --> 00:53:29,410
Rym: I got some good pictures.

844
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:31,379
Rym: Actually, I want to add a slide about obligation.

845
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:40,749
Rym: Okay, but anyway, so I can't say fuck all the time if I'm playing a game with like a bunch of eight-year-olds from the neighbor family.

846
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:44,402
Scott: or maybe You found some people near you and you have the same interesting games.

847
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:46,490
Rym: It's gonna work out, but they're really Republican.

848
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:51,890
Rym: Oh, they're really religious and they're a different religion from you and it's an issue for all of you, right?

849
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:59,128
Rym: Or they're just really prudish right and you're really loose and it's like like you You're a grande and you make a joke about how the king looks like a penis.

850
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:04,026
Scott: They're like At your game night, you're all drinking and smoking weed and at their game night.

851
00:54:04,106 --> 00:54:07,870
Scott: They're all like Whoa, that's that's or vice versa.

852
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:10,919
Scott: You're all and you go to a game night somewhere.

853
00:54:10,939 --> 00:54:14,590
Scott: you walk in and you smell the weed smoke and there's brownies and whatnot.

854
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,076
Scott: And it's like oh you're getting out of there.

855
00:54:16,397 --> 00:54:19,330
Rym: But the trouble is that a lot of gamers are desperate.

856
00:54:19,853 --> 00:54:21,159
Rym: We know they're desperate.

857
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,104
Rym: read any forum.

858
00:54:22,145 --> 00:54:23,170
Rym: go around this convention.

859
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:24,415
Rym: You'll see the desperate people.

860
00:54:24,476 --> 00:54:26,143
Rym: but some of you might be the desperate people.

861
00:54:26,585 --> 00:54:27,750
Rym: I've been desperate at many points.

862
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:29,090
Scott: I'm often desperate.

863
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:34,804
Rym: You'll play games with people that outside of the context of that specific game.

864
00:54:35,165 --> 00:54:40,459
Rym: You probably find abhorrence Either socially politically culturally.

865
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,839
Rym: you might have literally nothing to say to someone but yet gamers the world over We'll play games with those people if they're really desperate.

866
00:54:47,979 --> 00:54:58,630
Scott: if they're desperate which a lot of people are right, okay, so Regardless of those factors, right Those people near you they fit all those requirements.

867
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:01,276
Scott: They might just be hiding.

868
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:04,625
Scott: There are a lot of people out there who are just hiding.

869
00:55:04,905 --> 00:55:06,450
Scott: they they're not looking for you.

870
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:08,015
Scott: They're not looking to be found.

871
00:55:08,035 --> 00:55:08,858
Scott: They're playing games.

872
00:55:08,979 --> 00:55:09,581
Scott: They're into them.

873
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:10,263
Scott: You're into them.

874
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:13,655
Rym: They're really into a maybe yeah They're just not looking for anyone.

875
00:55:13,695 --> 00:55:13,936
Scott: why?

876
00:55:14,037 --> 00:55:15,060
Scott: because they got theirs.

877
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:16,324
Rym: and here's how you find out.

878
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:18,551
Rym: go look at a list of counter-strike Servers.

879
00:55:18,972 --> 00:55:24,228
Rym: notice all those servers that are locked that you need a password to get into notice how a lot of them are full.

880
00:55:24,248 --> 00:55:27,816
Rym: Yep How many D&D groups are open?

881
00:55:27,896 --> 00:55:30,745
Rym: invite how many open invite D&D groups go?

882
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:32,430
Scott: Well, yeah, they've got a D&D group.

883
00:55:32,631 --> 00:55:34,800
Scott: They've already got the GM and four players.

884
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:37,210
Scott: They're not advertising looking for more players.

885
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:40,137
Scott: They're not you know doing it.

886
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:40,860
Scott: they're just hiding.

887
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,890
Scott: they're meeting regularly in their house, you don't know them.

888
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:44,614
Scott: They don't know you.

889
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,990
Scott: they could be your next-door fucking neighbors, right?

890
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:49,805
Scott: You could be into D&D as much as they would but you don't know them.

891
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:52,633
Scott: They don't know you and That's the end of that.

892
00:55:52,674 --> 00:55:56,147
Scott: They're not looking and when you post looking they're not respond.

893
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:56,890
Scott: They're not responding.

894
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:57,071
Rym: Now.

895
00:55:57,091 --> 00:55:58,180
Rym: there's a lot of reasons for this.

896
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,760
Rym: I mean for example, we I've run a game night like every other week in our apartment.

897
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:03,121
Rym: Actually.

898
00:56:03,162 --> 00:56:10,430
Rym: We have two alternating sets of game nights Never going to publicly post that because I don't want a bunch of strangers showing up.

899
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:14,952
Rym: I personally invite individual people and we hang out and that's what we do Most.

900
00:56:15,153 --> 00:56:21,119
Rym: I think most of you are not super comfortable putting an ad on Craigslist saying hey You want to come play board games at my house?

901
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,650
Rym: Here's the address right door will be open.

902
00:56:24,154 --> 00:56:29,470
Scott: You're super comfortable saying hey Is there anyone out there who wants to play games or has a D&D or whatever?

903
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,730
Scott: But no one's gonna respond to that if they've already got one.

904
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,360
Scott: So none of those people even though they're there.

905
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,110
Scott: it is ridiculously difficult to find them.

906
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:55,328
Scott: The only way to find them would be to happenstance meet them and befriend them in another social context and then Discover that their game exists and then befriend them enough to which they would invite you or you could invite them into a gaming situation that would grow over time.

907
00:56:55,348 --> 00:56:59,083
Scott: and it's not easy that you have all seen this happen.

908
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:03,158
Rym: you go to some gaming meetup and Everyone's there kind of playing their games.

909
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,369
Rym: games are going well or badly or whatever.

910
00:57:05,911 --> 00:57:19,616
Rym: but then you see a new person shows up and everyone kind of talks to them and gets them to play games to kind of get a sense of if they're Creepy or not if they're good at games or not if they like the same kind of games and if some people really hit it Off you won't see.

911
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:26,029
Rym: you'll see people sort of try to invite them to their private gaming group Like hey, you should come to my apartment sometime we play games.

912
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:33,420
Rym: Those invitations are often said very quietly Far away from the main group of gamers.

913
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:33,922
Scott: Yep.

914
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:35,950
Rym: Nobody is super public about that.

915
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:47,546
Rym: In fact, a lot of people will pointedly Talk to someone after the event saying hey, you should come to my game group Because they didn't want that guy to overhear right now.

916
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:48,470
Scott: We're not gonna discuss.

917
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:51,264
Scott: I mean everything that needs to be said about that guy.

918
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:52,329
Scott: you all know that guy.

919
00:57:52,893 --> 00:57:54,041
Scott: That's all that needs to be said.

920
00:57:54,102 --> 00:58:02,670
Scott: right has been said already But it's not so much the concerns directly of you being that guy or how to deal with that guy when he's around.

921
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:08,530
Scott: It's more the fact that the guy exists in the first place, even if he doesn't physically exist.

922
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:11,389
Scott: Maybe you're lucky and you live in a town with know that guys in it.

923
00:58:11,631 --> 00:58:12,173
Rym: It's possible.

924
00:58:12,354 --> 00:58:15,930
Scott: the simple fact is that that guy exists somewhere on earth.

925
00:58:16,432 --> 00:58:26,946
Scott: people know that guy and are afraid of that guy or at least the phantom of that guy and Thus they will behave in a certain way to avoid any possibility of that guy.

926
00:58:27,147 --> 00:58:28,230
Rym: It's like in Martin.

927
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,876
Rym: I think of a funny example.

928
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:32,036
Rym: No,

929
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:38,127
Scott: just merely the fear of This thing this person possibly existing

930
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:39,653
Rym: Mario Party I know the stars

931
00:58:39,753 --> 00:58:53,082
Scott: of this right affects all the behavior of all the normal people and their behavior will not change Until not only are all those guys gone But no one has any fear of that guy possibly being there

932
00:58:53,483 --> 00:58:54,165
Rym: now that guy.

933
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:55,990
Scott: that day will not come in my lifetime.

934
00:58:56,191 --> 00:58:56,934
Rym: I mean there you.

935
00:58:57,135 --> 00:59:02,558
Rym: you could treat this like it's a game and that guy is a Event that's moving around on the board.

936
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:05,850
Rym: You've seen the scenario you're at a con you want to play, Puerto Rico.

937
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:07,598
Rym: It takes up to five players.

938
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,427
Rym: You've got three people are really into it.

939
00:59:09,487 --> 00:59:12,062
Rym: you yell out Hey anyone want to play Puerto Rico?

940
00:59:12,484 --> 00:59:13,389
Rym: two people walk up.

941
00:59:13,993 --> 00:59:21,039
Rym: You all give each other the look because you know that one of those people Seems okay And one of them is so obviously that guy.

942
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,907
Rym: you really don't want them to join their game because you're just.

943
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:34,147
Rym: you're sure Either they're gonna be that guy in the creepy possibly misogynistic You know all the bad odor bad something or it might be the relative.

944
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:37,196
Rym: that guy as in He's that guy to your group.

945
00:59:37,357 --> 00:59:45,496
Rym: if you're the super serious gamers and it's obvious that it's a guy who isn't super He's not gonna take the game seriously He's not gonna get the game.

946
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:51,302
Scott: someone who's gonna be even it could be something as simple as someone who's gonna be slow on their Turn or it'll be hard to explain the rules to.

947
00:59:51,704 --> 00:59:54,014
Scott: or you know It is just not someone.

948
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:59,773
Scott: that's someone who on their own it only takes one bad egg to spoil the whole omelet Right up.

949
00:59:59,853 --> 01:00:05,222
Rym: because if you get stuck in a game, you know, Puerto Rico Especially at a convention where you're teaching some rules.

950
01:00:05,624 --> 01:00:06,770
Rym: That's a two-hour commitment.

951
01:00:07,432 --> 01:00:13,250
Rym: If that's a two-hour commitment and someone ruins the game it is really bad culture.

952
01:00:13,531 --> 01:00:16,402
Rym: It's not part of the etiquette of gaming to walk away from a game.

953
01:00:16,422 --> 01:00:17,064
Rym: You're fucked.

954
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,180
Scott: I Might just start walking away from a game.

955
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,488
Rym: I've thought about making that.

956
01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:34,609
Rym: I'm think that maybe part of the reason that guy is enabled is that gaming culture especially tabletop and convention culture Makes it very difficult to politely turn that guy down.

957
01:00:35,051 --> 01:00:38,362
Rym: Hmm like if that guy wants to join your game, it's it's not.

958
01:00:38,522 --> 01:00:43,276
Rym: it's sort of seen as very not cool to be like, sorry We're gonna take this game super seriously.

959
01:00:43,336 --> 01:00:45,524
Rym: I know you're not really into these like really hardcore games.

960
01:00:46,206 --> 01:00:58,030
Rym: Mm-hmm, but If you said that the minor hurt feelings at least be mitigated by the honesty And then everyone has a better time because that guy is not having any fun in your super hardcore game either.

961
01:00:58,391 --> 01:01:00,036
Scott: Maybe or maybe he's just so desperate.

962
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:00,658
Scott: He is right.

963
01:01:00,678 --> 01:01:07,503
Rym: Who knows anyway, but as a result, it's people Try to like trick that guy and they're not joining the game.

964
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:11,460
Rym: like oh, sorry the game is full But it says clearly on the box that the game takes up to five.

965
01:01:11,721 --> 01:01:13,970
Rym: Yeah, our friend Steve is coming in a minute.

966
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:18,730
Rym: We're just waiting for him and then you see the guy like hovering around like waiting for Steve to show up.

967
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:20,176
Scott: These are things that literally happen.

968
01:01:20,216 --> 01:01:22,447
Rym: Yes, every one of these things has actually happened to us.

969
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:24,492
Scott: Yes All right.

970
01:01:24,532 --> 01:01:29,948
Scott: So one more thing that can get in the way of finding gamers to play games with is simply life.

971
01:01:31,592 --> 01:01:33,650
Scott: I'm running a torchbearer game, right?

972
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:38,746
Scott: We just I found people that I know that I can trust that are awesome a torchbearer.

973
01:01:39,047 --> 01:01:41,134
Scott: They're all 100% Not that guy there.

974
01:01:41,194 --> 01:01:42,098
Scott: Everyone's awesome.

975
01:01:42,178 --> 01:01:43,664
Scott: Everyone's really into it.

976
01:01:43,725 --> 01:01:45,010
Scott: Everyone really wants to play.

977
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:47,803
Scott: They at least said that they really liked the game when I ran it.

978
01:01:47,843 --> 01:01:48,667
Scott: They could be lying.

979
01:01:48,828 --> 01:01:49,230
Scott: Who knows?

980
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:52,648
Scott: I wish they wouldn't lie because if I'm doing something wrong, I want to know.

981
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,740
Scott: You know and we're playing on Google Hangouts.

982
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,970
Scott: that solves a lot of our problems, right?

983
01:01:59,071 --> 01:01:59,633
Scott: What happened?

984
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:02,402
Rym: Yeah, look you've solved geography, you've solved time zones, you've solved language.

985
01:02:02,602 --> 01:02:04,267
Rym: You're already friends, right?

986
01:02:04,428 --> 01:02:05,070
Scott: What happened?

987
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:08,841
Scott: Well, we played a couple sessions and now people's lives are getting in the way.

988
01:02:09,122 --> 01:02:13,680
Scott: Someone's got jobs changing schedules Someone's you know here.

989
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,286
Rym: look at this week.

990
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:18,825
Rym: Monday I had an impromptu meeting to consult with someone about an article they're writing.

991
01:02:18,845 --> 01:02:20,089
Rym: So me and Emily had dinner with them.

992
01:02:20,691 --> 01:02:21,675
Rym: So that killed Monday.

993
01:02:22,136 --> 01:02:23,561
Rym: Tuesday, we're doing GeekNights.

994
01:02:24,062 --> 01:02:27,872
Rym: Yeah, and then we're finishing work for the panel Wednesday.

995
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:33,897
Rym: tomorrow normally is our weekly game night, but now because suddenly I have to fly to Paris on Saturday I can do some shit together.

996
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,970
Rym: Yeah, so I got to cancel that game night Thursday.

997
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:37,700
Rym: We're doing GeekNights again, right?

998
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:44,190
Scott: People have lives and their lives Anyone, it doesn't matter who you are how highly you prioritize gaming in general.

999
01:02:44,622 --> 01:02:48,306
Scott: I mean Maybe you are a guy who plays Starcraft and that is your most.

1000
01:02:48,346 --> 01:02:49,070
Scott: that is your thing.

1001
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:52,630
Scott: You are a start your pro at Starcraft like that's your thing, right?

1002
01:02:53,392 --> 01:02:59,510
Scott: You are going to prioritize something such as I don't know your brother's wedding as more important than a star?

1003
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,798
Scott: Well, well, I would hope so.

1004
01:03:01,919 --> 01:03:03,425
Scott: Otherwise, you're that guy right?

1005
01:03:03,465 --> 01:03:09,869
Rym: Well, well, it depends God Say someone we knew scheduled their wedding at the same time as PAX Prime.

1006
01:03:10,932 --> 01:03:12,999
Scott: They're getting married at PAX Prime, right?

1007
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,524
Rym: Yeah, surprisingly they're not.

1008
01:03:15,065 --> 01:03:15,406
Scott: Okay.

1009
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:16,490
Scott: Why not?

1010
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:25,578
Rym: I really don't understand why but somehow they decided to get married in like I don't know Chicago At the same time as PAX Prime.

1011
01:03:26,282 --> 01:03:31,283
Scott: Well, this PAX Prime move into Chicago Maybe but not this year.

1012
01:03:31,645 --> 01:03:32,048
Scott: Why not?

1013
01:03:34,031 --> 01:03:42,121
Rym: Say your brother say your actual brother got married he announced the wedding It's all set up and it was literally the weekend of PAX Prime Next year, it's tough.

1014
01:03:42,403 --> 01:03:45,058
Scott: Yeah It's tough.

1015
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:57,012
Scott: it is tough, right But The point is these conflicts happen and when you have a gaming group right every person you have you're multiplying those difficulties Right.

1016
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,030
Scott: So how often does some shit come up in your life?

1017
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,236
Scott: And you have a gaming group of five people.

1018
01:04:01,617 --> 01:04:07,010
Scott: five times as much shit comes up and anytime one of those shits Happens the game is canceled.

1019
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:07,753
Scott: So is the moral?

1020
01:04:07,793 --> 01:04:13,709
Rym: not only one person in a gaming group is allowed to have a life because then everyone else is always gonna Show up whenever that person's available.

1021
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,430
Rym: Sure, that's the way to do it make friends with losers.

1022
01:04:18,152 --> 01:04:24,330
Rym: Yeah, there is actually a time and place where schedules and lives and priority are literally not a concern.

1023
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:26,134
Rym: Mmm that happened to us.

1024
01:04:26,174 --> 01:04:27,638
Rym: That's the only reason we college.

1025
01:04:27,858 --> 01:04:33,272
Rym: Yes college if one you you prioritize gaming above Classes.

1026
01:04:33,533 --> 01:04:36,503
Rym: Yes, like I'm not even joking not saying you should do this.

1027
01:04:36,663 --> 01:04:37,105
Rym: We did it.

1028
01:04:37,345 --> 01:04:38,750
Scott: Yes, but I'll take 2 a.m.

1029
01:04:39,051 --> 01:04:43,030
Rym: Oh my god, we would skip class to play counter-strike with our friends.

1030
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:49,790
Rym: We would skip class skip labs Drop classes to show up at the gaming clubs and play games.

1031
01:04:50,071 --> 01:04:52,525
Scott: We played German board game you in a class.

1032
01:04:52,545 --> 01:04:53,530
Scott: You can go to anime club.

1033
01:04:53,611 --> 01:04:56,290
Rym: I literally dropped out of a class so I could go to the anime club.

1034
01:04:56,370 --> 01:05:01,449
Rym: I dropped another class so I wouldn't miss an l5 our game that I joined after the class started.

1035
01:05:03,371 --> 01:05:10,738
Rym: We played games every goddamn day video games board games everything every day every weekend At a nerd school.

1036
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:19,673
Scott: if we were not at a nerd school which again Incredibly privileged to be able to afford to go to the nerd school and to be well educated enough to get accepted to the nerd School and

1037
01:05:19,693 --> 01:05:22,969
Rym: to be smart enough to somehow graduate without ever fucking going to class,

1038
01:05:22,989 --> 01:05:23,270
Scott: right?

1039
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:28,470
Scott: And even then in that group you go to like State School how many nerds are gonna be there?

1040
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,216
Scott: How often is the gaming club gonna meet?

1041
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:31,140
Scott: how many people will be there?

1042
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:41,670
Rym: Yeah, alrighty, there were like 150 to 200 people From a pool of a pool that would show up to the gaming club and of them like a hundred would show up every fuck.

1043
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:44,679
Scott: Is that a school that's consisted of thousands of nerds?

1044
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,769
Scott: you get you know tens of people at the gaming club.

1045
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:53,270
Rym: granted There were other not technically official gaming clubs that I just spawned up a hidden gamer.

1046
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:55,850
Scott: We were hiding from that guy right so anyway?

1047
01:05:56,694 --> 01:05:57,658
Scott: So what do you do about this?

1048
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,170
Rym: right it go to college never leave?

1049
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:04,870
Scott: Well, I mean we you know we've talked about all these reasons that you can't find another gamer.

1050
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:07,099
Scott: They're just not out there right there.

1051
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,325
Scott: all the things we've discussed.

1052
01:06:08,385 --> 01:06:09,813
Rym: so what I think there's two sides There's.

1053
01:06:09,854 --> 01:06:10,928
Rym: what can you do about it?

1054
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:14,543
Rym: And what can the what can gaming and the community do about it?

1055
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:15,949
Scott: right so what can you do about it?

1056
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:21,009
Scott: all I can tell you is either go to college or Move to a city a real city.

1057
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,074
Rym: Well not a joke city.

1058
01:06:22,094 --> 01:06:24,684
Rym: you have to move to a real city or a college town.

1059
01:06:24,724 --> 01:06:28,503
Rym: that has to be a big enough college To attract enough people and a nerdy college.

1060
01:06:28,523 --> 01:06:31,120
Rym: Yes, right I mean I went to.

1061
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:40,983
Rym: I won't name the name of the college But when I was living in Poughkeepsie I was bored wanted to find a gaming group and I found a gaming club at a local college That was open invite so I thought I'd go to it.

1062
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:41,648
Rym: I went to it.

1063
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:50,129
Rym: That's where I learned that this club was also the anime club and the witchcraft Wicca club and the science fiction club.

1064
01:06:50,651 --> 01:06:51,796
Rym: I had like five members.

1065
01:06:51,837 --> 01:06:54,870
Scott: there are so few nerds there, and I never went back right.

1066
01:06:55,560 --> 01:07:00,063
Scott: I looked in the door And I was like nope if you live in a city a major city so consider this.

1067
01:07:00,123 --> 01:07:05,859
Scott: I live in New York City the majorist Of cities in the world new room capital of Earth.

1068
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:12,700
Scott: okay, and when we play netrunner on Tuesday nights This is maybe 20 people tops.

1069
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,210
Scott: we go to the other tournament 20-something people.

1070
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:21,610
Scott: But apparently we just discovered that there's another secret hiding group of netrunners in Brooklyn at some NYU thing.

1071
01:07:21,731 --> 01:07:23,888
Scott: So there's probably more like 40 something people.

1072
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:32,290
Scott: Yeah, there's like maybe 50 to 60 total serious netrunner people that are in the community in all of New York City.

1073
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:34,982
Scott: Millions upon millions and millions of people.

1074
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:35,807
Scott: we'll go to one game.

1075
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:37,850
Scott: You're not in New York City.

1076
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,717
Scott: How many less people are there than that?

1077
01:07:39,777 --> 01:07:44,658
Scott: some guy went out told me he went out to Long Island to play and he won A tournament where they're only like six people.

1078
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,729
Scott: that's so close to where we are.

1079
01:07:47,171 --> 01:07:50,425
Rym: Hopefully it's not also a combination for you of dead or dying game.

1080
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:53,435
Scott: No, it's not Right static game.

1081
01:07:53,455 --> 01:07:55,704
Rym: all the people who started playing are the only ones who's still playing.

1082
01:07:56,065 --> 01:07:57,170
Scott: No we get new people not.

1083
01:07:58,392 --> 01:08:02,356
Scott: But I say it's like, you know, so if you're into magic, right It's like you can find people.

1084
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:04,307
Scott: that game is a worldwide game, right?

1085
01:08:04,348 --> 01:08:08,270
Rym: Oh my god It PAX Australia's a bunch of having the tabletop was just people play magic.

1086
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:11,070
Scott: There's a bunch of gaming meetups in New York City, right?

1087
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:15,350
Scott: But okay, New York City is four times the size of pretty much any other city.

1088
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:23,683
Scott: So you got to say Boston is 25% of the gaming that's in New York is in Boston I think is way smaller than four times, but they had no but they have.

1089
01:08:23,804 --> 01:08:25,250
Scott: they have nerds there at MIT and such.

1090
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:27,536
Scott: That gives them a boost Nerd town, right?

1091
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,599
Scott: San Francisco, Seattle get boost cuz of nerd town.

1092
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,130
Scott: Okay, go to I don't know Kansas City.

1093
01:08:35,229 --> 01:08:37,176
Scott: There's some nerds there in Kansas City.

1094
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:38,720
Scott: It's somewhat of a real city.

1095
01:08:39,022 --> 01:08:45,569
Scott: They even have a professional, you know sporting teams You know, they have Google Internet which brought some nerds into town.

1096
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:53,947
Scott: but there's probably like Less than a quarter of the gaming going on there as there isn't in New York, right?

1097
01:08:53,987 --> 01:08:54,930
Scott: Just because of population.

1098
01:08:55,691 --> 01:09:01,510
Rym: Now there's also the weird side of it's like New York City actually has some problems that make some aspects of gaming way harder.

1099
01:09:01,992 --> 01:09:03,518
Rym: So it even gets hard on the upper end.

1100
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:04,642
Rym: you would like Toronto.

1101
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:06,750
Rym: There's a bunch of board game cafes.

1102
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,634
Scott: There's one in New York now.

1103
01:09:07,694 --> 01:09:09,301
Rym: Yeah, there's one in New York.

1104
01:09:09,442 --> 01:09:11,390
Scott: I thought there's only one in Toronto snakes and lattes.

1105
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:13,384
Rym: I I heard that there's two more.

1106
01:09:13,404 --> 01:09:14,170
Scott: I haven't heard that.

1107
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:15,475
Rym: That's what I was told when I was there.

1108
01:09:15,537 --> 01:09:15,959
Rym: people told me.

1109
01:09:16,099 --> 01:09:17,345
Rym: Oh, you should visit this other place.

1110
01:09:17,527 --> 01:09:17,848
Scott: Okay?

1111
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:19,192
Scott: Whatever.

1112
01:09:19,212 --> 01:09:23,410
Scott: Okay, so something else that we can all do have more conventions.

1113
01:09:23,892 --> 01:09:37,785
Scott: Why is there just you know a few paxes right and I guess crappy Gen Con and a couple other tiny aspects of dragon con right Aspects of ConnectiCon aspect a lot of cons board game gaming.

1114
01:09:37,986 --> 01:09:44,430
Scott: on this There's a significant number of cons, but there's way more anime cons than gaming cons.

1115
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:47,319
Scott: There are tiny anime cons friggin all over the plane.

1116
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,990
Rym: those tiny anime cons grow huge really quick.

1117
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:53,930
Rym: Yeah, that's thousands of people at those things that got caught, you know, we laugh like it's a small con.

1118
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,099
Rym: It's actually pretty fucking big now thousands of people.

1119
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:58,950
Scott: Yeah, right and it's in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

1120
01:09:59,331 --> 01:10:01,299
Rym: It's like I'd never heard of Lancaster before.

1121
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:02,965
Scott: I've heard of it, but it's like that is.

1122
01:10:03,005 --> 01:10:04,450
Scott: that's even less than Kansas City.

1123
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:08,070
Scott: That's a small place but thousands of little nerds show up for that anime con.

1124
01:10:08,191 --> 01:10:11,470
Scott: So why can't there be as many gaming cons as there are anime cons?

1125
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,503
Scott: There should be one near any wherever you live.

1126
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,894
Scott: There should be one a month Driving distance.

1127
01:10:17,637 --> 01:10:18,922
Rym: in a sense there should are.

1128
01:10:19,203 --> 01:10:23,275
Rym: there are tons of gaming cons But this is con culture.

1129
01:10:23,656 --> 01:10:31,350
Rym: the gaming cons that are like packs and mag fest have a almost completely separate culture from What traditionally was considered a gaming con?

1130
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:32,033
Rym: I mean as a kid.

1131
01:10:32,435 --> 01:10:35,993
Rym: there were like nine conventions within a short drive of my house in Michigan Hmm.

1132
01:10:36,134 --> 01:10:37,120
Rym: and I went to a bunch of them.

1133
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:37,744
Rym: You know what?

1134
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:44,287
Rym: they were all Under a thousand people and they were all the old-school pay for tickets to individual.

1135
01:10:44,308 --> 01:10:44,990
Scott: They're over con.

1136
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:47,278
Rym: Yeah, they were like uber cons right or the.

1137
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,028
Rym: all those other little gaming cons are in New York City like they're

1138
01:10:50,068 --> 01:10:50,289
Scott: there

1139
01:10:50,771 --> 01:11:03,602
Rym: But they have such a different culture that for whatever reason they can't really grow and the few that do grow tend to run into a lot of problems and Have a lot of internal drama just like gaming groups do huh?

1140
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:08,178
Scott: Yeah, so, you know if you want more gaming I think more conventions would just help a lot.

1141
01:11:08,218 --> 01:11:13,095
Scott: and then finally just at least for us in the u.s Here in Canada, right?

1142
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:14,801
Scott: We need better internets, right?

1143
01:11:14,901 --> 01:11:19,519
Scott: It's like we already have probably know that someone far away There's gonna be latency no matter what.

1144
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:23,057
Scott: but if our internet was just better There's dude still be.

1145
01:11:23,077 --> 01:11:25,670
Scott: there's a lot of games that I should be able to play with someone.

1146
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:27,503
Scott: But our and we both have money.

1147
01:11:27,543 --> 01:11:32,629
Scott: we both have good computers But the internet just sucks and we can't buy better internet or the internet just can't do things.

1148
01:11:32,649 --> 01:11:40,630
Rym: yet like we don't have Augmented reality is where we both have a physical esque copy of a board game in front of us and are playing remotely with holograms.

1149
01:11:40,811 --> 01:11:43,590
Scott: Nope, someday that'll happen, but we need to get you know.

1150
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,677
Scott: We just need to fix internet in the u.s.

1151
01:11:45,697 --> 01:11:56,210
Scott: To where you know, we can get google fiber everywhere or you know Isp, stop screwing everyone over and little things like automatic translation generic places for games lots of stuff that could happen there.

1152
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:07,570
Scott: Sure, I guess the last thing that you can do to find gamers in this desperate situation is Simply to change who you are or at least something about yourself, right?

1153
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:11,070
Scott: Maybe you really want to play an rpg and you're a dnd person.

1154
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:18,255
Scott: That's what you're into and the people near you are into pathfinder and it's like well Just become a pathfinder person.

1155
01:12:18,336 --> 01:12:20,822
Scott: It's not it's not that different right?

1156
01:12:21,143 --> 01:12:23,610
Scott: just you know, you're outvoted, right?

1157
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:28,829
Scott: Would you rather play pathfinder which is really similar to what you already want to do, right?

1158
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:33,770
Scott: Even though it's not exactly what you'd like to do or would you rather stay home and play nothing?

1159
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:40,050
Rym: And if you don't play pathfinder then it'll be really hard to convince those people to switch to dnd, right?

1160
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:48,395
Rym: But if you play with them, I mean i've seen there's a lot of commentary with indie rpg Someone will join a dnd group and then over the years be like hey Why don't we try this indie rpg?

1161
01:12:48,676 --> 01:12:52,590
Rym: you can actually groom other people to be into the games you're into.

1162
01:12:52,972 --> 01:12:53,436
Rym: You play.

1163
01:12:53,476 --> 01:12:54,443
Scott: you play league of legends.

1164
01:12:54,463 --> 01:12:55,430
Scott: Your friend is into dota.

1165
01:12:56,191 --> 01:12:57,537
Scott: Just play dota right?

1166
01:12:57,638 --> 01:12:57,758
Scott: It's.

1167
01:12:57,939 --> 01:12:59,225
Scott: it's just go, you know, it's.

1168
01:12:59,506 --> 01:13:00,270
Scott: it's not that different.

1169
01:13:00,632 --> 01:13:04,410
Scott: Would you rather play dota with your friend or would you rather play league of legends alone and him play dota alone?

1170
01:13:05,530 --> 01:13:08,646
Rym: Right just just play team fortress 2. is not that different from others?

1171
01:13:08,868 --> 01:13:09,270
Scott: one, right?

1172
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:11,950
Scott: You can't change anyone else you can only change yourself.

1173
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:16,310
Scott: So don't you know, you're not gonna be if the other person's stubborn just give up on that.

1174
01:13:16,571 --> 01:13:20,530
Scott: Just be the unstubborn person and more gaming will happen, right?

1175
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,265
Scott: You know if you're if you play call of duty your phone plays counter-strike.

1176
01:13:23,305 --> 01:13:24,009
Scott: just play counter-strike.

1177
01:13:24,552 --> 01:13:28,793
Rym: But if you try to bludgeon other people over the head like you've got to play this other game instead It's not gonna work.

1178
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:37,203
Scott: you become that guy to them if you're if you're super serious like, you know about playing to win Right and and the other people are just sort of like la la la and they don't care.

1179
01:13:37,223 --> 01:13:39,070
Scott: and that's all you've got to play with.

1180
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:46,469
Rym: Just change your attitude right or be super fun and sociable and do all the social stuff, but still just fucking win.

1181
01:13:47,031 --> 01:13:51,407
Rym: Just be the guy who always fucking wins but doesn't make a big deal about it's like I won again.

1182
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,170
Rym: I won again.

1183
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:53,201
Rym: Oh Rym always wins.

1184
01:13:53,525 --> 01:13:58,943
Scott: Yep Yeah, just change yourself so that you can make the situation whatever situation you've got.

1185
01:13:59,204 --> 01:13:59,705
Scott: work right.

1186
01:13:59,745 --> 01:14:02,133
Scott: you don't have a lot to work with Right.

1187
01:14:02,414 --> 01:14:13,079
Rym: So whatever you've got make the most of it, but at the same time Don't misinterpret someone not wanting to play a game with you for hating you Because they probably hate you.

1188
01:14:13,099 --> 01:14:17,117
Rym: Yeah, they probably do but I don't think we want that more.

1189
01:14:17,137 --> 01:14:18,304
Rym: It'll be in the actual tax panel.

1190
01:14:18,465 --> 01:14:22,082
Rym: No Mm-hmm, but think of it this way.

1191
01:14:22,142 --> 01:14:23,969
Rym: Would you invite this person into your house?

1192
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:27,057
Scott: Barely knowing them would you?

1193
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:29,690
Scott: are you a person that people want to invite into their home?

1194
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:32,579
Scott: Yeah, be a person that you would want to invite dude.

1195
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:35,450
Rym: Does every group evaporate the moment you try to join it?

1196
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:39,166
Rym: That's more back to the that guy you shouldn't.

1197
01:14:39,187 --> 01:14:42,577
Rym: yeah All right, that's all.

1198
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:45,091
Rym: Did anyone want to ask a question?

1199
01:14:45,111 --> 01:14:46,137
Rym: I guess they can't.

1200
01:14:46,378 --> 01:14:49,012
Rym: no I don't know if you have any comments on this.

1201
01:14:49,373 --> 01:14:50,740
Rym: Uh, we didn't mind that did we do met?

1202
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,868

Rym: Yeah, we do a little bit.

1204
01:14:53,197 --> 01:15:04,252
Rym: basically If you ask us questions about what we talked about or have anything interesting to add anecdotes, whatever uh We we got some time before packs we can edit this panel.

1205
01:15:04,452 --> 01:15:13,780
Rym: guys the secret to our panels that we have a list of slides Because those are just the main points We uh make it up every time we do a panel is different because we just know what we're gonna talk about.

1206
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:14,503
Rym: That's it?

1207
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,836
Rym: so if you tell us something cool we might incorporate it into the panel.

1208
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:25,944
Rym: maybe hopefully I just imagine this people will tell us their stuff and everything they tell us becomes the anecdotes of what not to do The anecdote of that guy.

1209
01:15:25,965 --> 01:15:26,908
