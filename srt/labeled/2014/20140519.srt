1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,127
Rym: It's Monday, May 19th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:10,469
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:13,994
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,807
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:18,280
Rym: Tonight it's a tech news roundup.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,360
Rym: 'Cause tons of stuff is happening.

7
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:22,919
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,913
Rym: So yeah, little unexpected GeekNights hiatus 'cause I was in Sweden and the UK and Germany.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,919
Rym: Two cities in Germany hanging out doing stuff.

10
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:42,580
Rym: Playing games, drinking with people late into the night because the sun just doesn't fucking set in Stockholm.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,572
Scott: Oh, pretty far north there.

12
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:45,420
Scott: Summertime, yeah.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,780
Rym: I walk out of this thing pretty drunk and I look around and it's, you know, kinda light out.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,546
Scott: Isn't it weird though?

15
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:51,800
Scott: All the light is coming from the north?

16
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:55,225
Rym: But yeah, good times.

17
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:55,707
Rym: I'm back.

18
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:56,791
Rym: Not gonna dwell on the trip now.

19
00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:58,960
Rym: I'll share choice anecdotes from the trip later.

20
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:06,320
Rym: But one thing I can say is in Sweden, the news played nothing for the entire time I was there.

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,720
Rym: But replays of the Rangers winning that game.

22
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:12,000
Scott: Oh yeah, Sweden-New York bonding.

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,760
Scott: Our goalie happens to be the best person from your country.

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,020
Rym: I'm usually in places where people care a lot about soccer or football, which I really don't care about at all.

25
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,900
Rym: And I have to kinda be polite and be whatever and I got no one to talk to.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,148
Rym: But when I was in Sweden, I was the one who liked hockey.

27
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,740
Rym: None of the other people there except the Swedish people knew or liked hockey.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,330
Scott: But you could bond with the Swedish people.

29
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:36,540
Scott: Those are the people you actually care about.

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,680
Scott: Who cares about the other people who came with you from some other country?

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,440
Scott: So while the Red Wings didn't quite make it, they didn't even come close to making it.

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,120
Rym: Yeah, not a good few years coming up for the Red Wings with their team disposition and everything.

33
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:50,939
Rym: But Rangers got a shot.

34
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,187
Scott: We have a small shot.

35
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:52,852
Scott: It's rare.

36
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:53,960
Scott: But we got one.

37
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:54,544
Rym: Yeah.

38
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:56,356
Rym: Good news.

39
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:56,920
Rym: Good times.

40
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,344
Scott: Well, we'll see about that.

41
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:03,120
Scott: I feel somewhat confident about getting to the finals, which is crazy.

42
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:07,280
Scott: I don't feel very confident about beating the Blackhawks or the Kings.

43
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,051
Rym: I'm just excited about Game 7s.

44
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:09,637
Rym: All these Game 7s.

45
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,740
Scott: Well, the Rangers are the best at Game 7.

46
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,200
Rym: Game 7 is my favorite game.

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,513
Scott: But the Kings are probably easier to beat than the Blackhawks.

48
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:17,980
Scott: The Blackhawks are most dangerous.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,942
Rym: In fact, having been a Red Wings fan for so long, my favorite games are either Game 4 or Game 7.

50
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:26,008
Rym: Depending on what year it is.

51
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:28,100
Rym: 96, 97, 98, Game 4.

52
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,800
Scott: Listen, if the Rangers win seven more games before the end of the season, we have a parade.

53
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,680
Rym: Yeah, I will skip work to go to that parade because hockey.

54
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,034
Scott: That's like my third parade since moving here.

55
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:41,820
Scott: That's pretty good.

56
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,718
Rym: Rangers are my second team.

57
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:52,000
Rym: So I guess it's a Tech News roundup because lots of Tech News happened while I was overseas and away.

58
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,460
Scott: So you think Tech News roundup, that's a lazy cop-out.

59
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,119
Scott: We haven't done a Tech News roundup since, coincidentally, one year ago.

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,229
Rym: One year.

61
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,267
Scott: Not too bad.

62
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:01,440
Scott: We're not lazy too often.

63
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,060
Rym: Let's get right into it though because lots of stuff.

64
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:11,020
Rym: It's funny, we always complain among ourselves that most Tech News is actually some other kind of news.

65
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:14,920
Rym: Most of these involve some big company buying some other company.

66
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:16,720
Rym: Or politics.

67
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,671
Scott: It's always tough because that's business news.

68
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:21,520
Scott: That's politics news, right?

69
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:22,926
Rym: I think there's a better moral here.

70
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,880
Rym: All news is technology news.

71
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:29,659
Scott: I guess you could make an argument that all news is political news.

72
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,417
Rym: Yes, because politics...

73
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,100
Scott: All news is business news.

74
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,694
Rym: Is politics or technology more fundamental?

75
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,580
Rym: Can technology force politics?

76
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,200
Rym: Or does politics hold back or force technology?

77
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,427
Scott: All news is science news.

78
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,500
Scott: These atoms interacted in this way today.

79
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:53,600
Rym: And thus, there is no free will for all is preordained because for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

80
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,400
Scott: Should we just do all the... Since it's Tech News roundup, should we do news now or should we just do thing of the day and then do all tech news?

81
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,779
Rym: Oh, jump right to the thing of the day.

82
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,989
Scott: Well, I mean, it's news and then news.

83
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,180
Scott: What's the point of splitting it in half for no reason?

84
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,219
Rym: Well, I think the music is telling us what we're going to do.

85
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,650
Rym: So things of the day.

86
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,853
Rym: This is just pretty great.

87
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:23,590
Rym: I didn't verify to see if the statistics are real, but I'm pretty sure they are just by eyeballing them.

88
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,558
Rym: This is the spurious correlation engine.

89
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:32,830
Rym: Pick two variables and generate a correlation that is probably not a causation.

90
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:43,733
Rym: For example, there's a strong correlation between US spending on science space and technology and suicides by hanging strangulation and suffocation since 1999.

91
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,430
Scott: The more we spend on science, the more people will kill themselves.

92
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,470
Rym: The divorce rate in Maine correlates extremely strongly.

93
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,089
Scott: Or the more people kill themselves, the more we spend on science.

94
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:57,650
Rym: The divorce rate in Maine actually correlates really closely with the per capita consumption of margarine in the entire United States.

95
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,198
Scott: Stop divorcing in Maine.

96
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,910
Scott: They're divorcing because of butter margarine arguments in the household.

97
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:08,030
Rym: While you present your thing of the day, I'm going to figure out where they got the stat from.

98
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:19,389
Rym: Because the age of the winner of Miss America until 2009 correlated very strongly with, and I quote, "Murder by steam, hot vapor, and/or hot

99
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:19,890
Rym: object.".

100
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,390
Rym: I did not know that was a category.

101
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,861
Scott: Because Miss America is hot.

102
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:24,870
Scott: That's how she gets hot.

103
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,815
Rym: How is that a category of anything?

104
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:32,390
Rym: How many people are murdered by steam, hot vapors that there is a category for this?

105
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,490
Rym: Apparently in 1999 the answer was seven.

106
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,549
Scott: Listen, okay, so here's how it works.

107
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:42,430
Scott: When the winner of Miss America is old, how did she win if she's less hot because she's old?

108
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,210
Scott: Because she murdered the judges who were going to vote for the young people.

109
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,703
Rym: But that's arguing that people are murdered by the hot object.

110
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,210
Scott: Right, with her hotness.

111
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:55,130
Scott: And then, when the winner of Miss America is young, no one had to be murdered for that to happen.

112
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,650
Scott: They just let the judges decide.

113
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:04,647
Rym: Alright, I found a lot of interesting information about murders by steam and hot vapors, but this is my thing of the day.

114
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:05,710
Rym: This is very enjoyable.

115
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,130
Scott: Okay, my thing is gaming related.

116
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:20,270
Scott: So what this is, it is the, you probably saw it on the internet a while ago, we haven't done a show though, is the algorithm that I guess at least the first Pokemon game uses for what exactly happens when you throw a Pokeball.

117
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:21,270
Scott: All the math.

118
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:22,629
Rym: Oh, oh god.

119
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,670
Scott: Right, down to exactly what happens.

120
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:27,730
Rym: Guys, hitting A at the right moment does not have an effect.

121
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,816
Scott: No, it doesn't.

122
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,628
Rym: So it's actually- I still do it though.

123
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,236
Scott: It's actually pretty interesting, right?

124
00:06:34,337 --> 00:06:38,668
Scott: Basically, there's this sort of auto catch factor, right?

125
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,208
Scott: And it's like, depending on whether, what kind of Pokemon it is, and what kind of ball you're using, right?

126
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,244
Scott: It's like, you might, it's not just like percentage to catch done, right?

127
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:53,130
Scott: It's like there's two different ways to catch.

128
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,670
Rym: Whoa, frozen works better than paralyzed, interesting.

129
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,530
Scott: Yeah, yeah, so sleep and frozen are the best, basically, right?

130
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:08,930
Scott: So with sleep and frozen, you're basically expanding the initial sort of catch possibility, and if you get that catch, then you're good, right?

131
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:12,182
Scott: If you fail at that catch, then it goes down to the other one.

132
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:14,330
Scott: that's based on the low HP and whatnot, right?

133
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:22,930
Scott: So if you're trying to catch like a legendary, it might actually be easier to like sleep it and just use great balls, right?

134
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:30,230
Scott: As opposed to some other kind of, you know, another Pokemon might be better off to bring it down to one HP and use an ultra ball.

135
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,270
Scott: And it's very interesting exactly how this happens, right?

136
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,070
Scott: But it basically, you know, to sum it up, there's two different chances to catch.

137
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:44,630
Scott: And if you can catch, if you can increase your probabilities on the first chance, you don't care about the second chance.

138
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,033
Scott: So the HP doesn't matter.

139
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:54,423
Scott: And if you fail at the first chance, and sometimes it's easier to just bump up the probability on the second chance, which is the HP based chance, right?

140
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:55,850
Scott: And then you can ignore the other, you know.

141
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,530
Rym: Oh my God, it even tells you how it determines how many times the Pokeball wobbles.

142
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,190
Scott: Yep.

143
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:03,861
Scott: And even the message that shows up.

144
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,170
Scott: So actually, yeah, the messages that show up.

145
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,609
Rym: Darn, the Pokemon broke free.

146
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,231
Scott: Right.

147
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:18,190
Scott: Those messages are actually related to the virtual die roll, right, that happened in the game, you know, when you played.

148
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:23,149
Rym: Oh my God, the three wobble and then shoot, it was too, it was so close too.

149
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:23,773
Scott: Yep.

150
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:24,729
Rym: That's the worst.

151
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,430
Scott: So yeah, if you care about Pokemans, read this.

152
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,322
Scott: Also, this is the kind of work that like Nintendo does that makes games great.

153
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:36,390
Scott: that is unheralded and usually unknown.

154
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,150
Rym: Guys, if you design a game and you don't have math like this, your game might have issues.

155
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,030
Scott: Yeah.

156
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:47,650
Scott: You know, this is why, you know, at least fundamentally in the polish, right, Nintendo's still making games better than most people.

157
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:48,131
Rym: Yep.

158
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:54,690
Rym: Though I did see a great article where someone was arguing that Mario Kart 8 is like the end of good Mario Karts.

159
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:56,348
Scott: Well, that happened a while ago.

160
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:04,649
Rym: Yeah, granted, that argument seemed specious because their primary debate was, or their primary point was, Battle Mode got gimped.

161
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,109
Rym: Seriously, Battle Mode is the worst mode.

162
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,510
Scott: No one gives a shit about Battle Mode.

163
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,730
Rym: Except apparently these guys, I guess it's their Windjammers.

164
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:11,249
Scott: It must be their Windjammers.

165
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,073
Scott: But yeah, no.

166
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:18,590
Scott: At least they were, you know, reporting on the actual game in sort of the right way.

167
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:18,899
Scott: Yeah.

168
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,829
Scott: Even though they're wrong.

169
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,528
Scott: I mean, they're right and wrong, right?

170
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,661
Scott: They're wrong that Battle Mode is important.

171
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:25,850
Scott: They're right Mario Kart is important.

172
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,410
Rym: That Battle Mode should not exist.

173
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:27,993
Scott: Yeah.

174
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:29,770
Scott: No one wants Battle Mode, guys.

175
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,629
Rym: Except these guys.

176
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,389
Scott: Except these guys.

177
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,190
Rym: So yeah, Metamode, very briefly, the Book Club book is a canticle for Leibowitz.

178
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:35,801
Rym: I started reading it.

179
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,429
Rym: There's no fucking legitimate ebook of it.

180
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,989
Scott: I think there's an expensive Kindle one.

181
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,450
Rym: On the Amazon store there was not one.

182
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:54,950
Rym: Oh, well, I... And when I searched for a Canticle for Leibowitz ebook, I found a bunch of books that have the text from the author of Canticle for Leibowitz that do not include that story.

183
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:55,610
Scott: Huh.

184
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:57,801
Scott: Well, I just went on Google.

185
00:09:58,102 --> 00:09:59,227
Scott: I didn't even find it on Pirate Bay.

186
00:09:59,248 --> 00:09:59,770
Scott: I went on Google.

187
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,099
Scott: I found a webpage that had links to ebooks in every format.

188
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,530
Scott: I downloaded one and I dragged it onto my iPad and my Kindle.

189
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,593
Rym: That is what I'll be doing.

190
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:14,131
Rym: because I don't want to buy... I can buy Canticle for Leibowitz on a paperback for $0.71.

191
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:14,690
Scott: Yeah, that's about right.

192
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,020
Rym: So I'm going to pirate that $0.71.

193
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,606
Rym: Sorry, dude, selling the $0.71 copy.

194
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,426
Rym: The used copy.

195
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,290
Rym: I'm going to get the illegal, probably not official, ebook instead because I'm done with physical books.

196
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,061
Scott: The ebook that I got is pretty good looking.

197
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,450
Scott: It looks like an official, you know, real deal.

198
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,493
Rym: You know what I almost want to do?

199
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,476
Rym: This is a brilliant idea.

200
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,430
Rym: Make ebooks for books that don't have ebooks or that people like to pirate.

201
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,890
Rym: Make them totally legit for like the first three quarters and then just have a different ending.

202
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,120
Rym: That would be the greatest troll.

203
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:50,709
Rym: I want someone to do this.

204
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:51,422
Scott: Do it.

205
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:53,668
Rym: I'm too lazy to do this.

206
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,090
Scott: Alright, let's do other meta moments.

207
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,956
Rym: In fact, or better, better, don't change the ending.

208
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:00,424
Rym: Just add a weird sex scene.

209
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:02,230
Rym: And that's all you do.

210
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,123
Scott: Do something to each book differently.

211
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:04,989
Scott: that's a book appropriate.

212
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,090
Rym: I think different ending and weird sex scene are the best possible things you can do.

213
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,109
Scott: So, Kinetic Con is coming up.

214
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,113
Rym: Kinetic Con!

215
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:15,930
Rym: We'll get the schedule up as soon as we can, slowly filling it on the website.

216
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,350
Rym: We'll be there doing some panels, running the panels department.

217
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,690
Rym: Kinetic Con is awesome and you should all attend.

218
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:31,845
Rym: If you live in the Northeast, like within a reasonable drive of Hartford, Connecticut, in the summer, there are few better conventions to go to that cater to anything other than just animu.

219
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,944
Scott: Any nerdery that you have has representation at Kinetic Con.

220
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,189
Scott: Fighting games, got it.

221
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:42,038
Scott: Animes, got it.

222
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,189
Scott: Tabletop games, RPGs, got it.

223
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:46,709
Scott: Sign by, book writing, we got that.

224
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,830
Rym: Yep, you want panels on like literary criticism, they're in there.

225
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,109
Scott: Tea ceremonies, we got that.

226
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:52,729
Rym: The films of John Waters.

227
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,710
Rym: Homestucks, maybe.

228
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,889
Scott: There will be homestucks there for you to hang out with.

229
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,260
Rym: Yep.

230
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:03,190
Scott: Any nerdy thing that you are into that is modern.

231
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,030
Rym: And yeah, look at us on YouTube, blah blah blah blah blah whatever.

232
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,549
Scott: We're on the internet, come look for us.

233
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:10,150
Rym: Yes, Google for GeekNights guys.

234
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,650
Rym: I'm amazed at how many people, they're like, they want to get in touch with us.

235
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,849
Rym: I'm like yeah, just Google GeekNights.

236
00:12:16,515 --> 00:12:18,249
Rym: And like they don't get it and they want a URL.

237
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,790
Rym: Like they don't realize they can type things into Google and get information.

238
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:26,350
Scott: Then they're probably not going to understand anything that we talk about on this show.

239
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,270
Rym: Yep, like I've almost gotten to the point where I kind of want to take the URL off of our business cards.

240
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,830
Rym: And just have text on the back that says Google for GeekNights.

241
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,268
Rym: And if they don't find us, it was never meant to be.

242
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,970
Scott: There are some other Geek Nightses.

243
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,889
Rym: Yes, there's the Oxford Geek Nightses.

244
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,910
Rym: We completely dominate them on Google Juice.

245
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,570
Scott: There's also some other podcast that's in Spanish that's like GeekNights CUU or something like that.

246
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,117
Rym: We could send them to CND.

247
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:55,170
Rym: We have a common law trademark.

248
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,850
Scott: I think it's like some Spanish university organization or something.

249
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,432
Rym: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 11

250
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:07,470
Rym: of the 13 links if you Google GeekNights on Google, Google on Google, are us.

251
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:13,250
Rym: And then the other two are for two GeekNights meetups in Albion.

252
00:13:14,915 --> 00:13:15,820
Rym: Oh, related searches.

253
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,650
Rym: GeekNights with hosts.

254
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,817
Rym: GeekNights Rym.

255
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:20,070
Rym: GeekNights Utena.

256
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,129
Scott: Oh, you should watch that GeekNights Utena.

257
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,630
Rym: Yes, two new episodes will come out as soon as I have time to edit them if I'm not flying around to Europe like every goddamn day.

258
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:33,439
Rym: Warning, might not be GeekNights next week.

259
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,250
Rym: My boss is trying to send me to Hong Kong Tuesday morning.

260
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:41,550
Rym: I never thought I'd say this, but I don't want to go to Hong Kong on Tuesday.

261
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:43,970
Rym: I would rather that not happen.

262
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:45,186
Scott: I don't want to go to Toronto.

263
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,690
Rym: In Hong Kong, children have cigarette ads for faces.

264
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,285
Scott: No, but there's a lot of people smoking cigarettes there.

265
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:52,009
Scott: That's for sure.

266
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,666
Rym: So the biggest news is that there is a rumor that was pretty solid.

267
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:58,830
Rym: that has since had some clarification.

268
00:13:59,272 --> 00:13:59,554
Scott: It's weird.

269
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:01,745
Scott: It went from solid to rumor to solid to rumor.

270
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:02,730
Scott: I don't know what to believe anymore.

271
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,050
Rym: YouTube is buying Twitch for a billion dollars.

272
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,049
Scott: That makes sense.

273
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:06,731
Rym: Yes.

274
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:11,210
Rym: Now, one, Reddit went apeshit about how they're going to ruin Twitch.

275
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:26,030
Rym: And all I have to say is that for anyone who has never used real streaming technology, which includes the guy who was working with me, who worked for Twitch at PAX, who had never used YouTube's live streaming before, the backend of YouTube, live events.

276
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:36,490
Scott: The part most people don't see, because in order to have the access to the live streaming on YouTube, you have to have a thousand subscribers at least, and you have to try to use it, and you have to set up real technology.

277
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:38,329
Scott: So almost no one has seen it.

278
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:40,450
Rym: I think they've since relaxed those requirements.

279
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,670
Scott: Yeah, but even so, almost no one's actually messed with that technology.

280
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,609
Rym: So Twitch, right?

281
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,210
Rym: Twitch, you just turn on your whatever software and point it at Twitch, and it kind of just works.

282
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:55,350
Rym: YouTube, first you set up your technology with end cameras.

283
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,390
Rym: Primary and backup for each camera angle.

284
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:05,910
Rym: Arbitrary numbers of camera angles, different encoding formats, different encoders, as many bandwidths, as many resolutions as you want.

285
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,169
Rym: You set up all that bullshit.

286
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,169
Rym: And then you get a dashboard where you can preview your stream, something you can't do on Twitch.

287
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:16,230
Rym: And then you can check your stream out, check the sync.

288
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:17,030
Scott: Make sure it's working.

289
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:19,390
Scott: Make sure the audio's working.

290
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:25,870
Rym: You can start your event at a designated time, as in it fades in and you're there doing your thing.

291
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:30,990
Rym: As opposed to Twitch, where the first ten minutes of every stream is someone like Dave Riley sitting there going, "Is this working?

292
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:33,618
Rym: I'm just going to hang out here.

293
00:15:33,638 --> 00:15:35,450
Rym: Is anyone... Alright, I got the game going.

294
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:37,039
Rym: Oh, someone joined the channel.

295
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,247
Rym: Okay, we'll start in like ten

296
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:38,609
Rym: minutes.".

297
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,570
Scott: Hey, can you see what I'm doing?

298
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,372
Scott: Yeah.

299
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:41,059
Rym: Hey, does this work?

300
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:41,888
Rym: Can you see me?

301
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,492
Scott: Yeah.

302
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:43,136
Rym: Can you see me?

303
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:44,303
Rym: Can you see me?

304
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:45,469
Scott: Can you see me?

305
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,008
Scott: Exactly.

306
00:15:47,673 --> 00:16:00,150
Scott: Hopefully, if this does happen, that will be the one major thing that happens that will affect actual users is the streaming technology for streamers will be vastly improved.

307
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,709
Rym: The average streamer doesn't understand how this shit works at all.

308
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:06,313
Scott: Okay.

309
00:16:07,538 --> 00:16:15,530
Scott: But I think one of the negatives that I can see would be that the YouTube copyright enforcement regime would be all over Twitch.

310
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:24,010
Rym: The only reason I use Twitch instead of YouTube live events is because I often get copyright takedowns that stop my stream on YouTube.

311
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,331
Scott: Right.

312
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,250
Scott: So it's like, let's say I was playing Mario on YouTube, right?

313
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:32,584
Scott: And it's like you get these copyright things that are like, "Hey, you got the Mario song in there.

314
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:33,448
Scott: That's copyrighted,

315
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:33,608
Scott: yo.".

316
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:36,170
Scott: And it's like, yeah, because I'm playing Mario.

317
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,461
Rym: But you can't appeal it.

318
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:38,329
Rym: Your stream just shuts down.

319
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:39,634
Scott: Yeah.

320
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:41,788
Scott: But on Twitch, it's like, "Oh, play Mario.

321
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:42,190
Scott: Awesome.

322
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,039
Scott: That's what this is

323
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,141
Scott: for.".

324
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,350
Scott: It's like, why is it a problem on YouTube?

325
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,969
Rym: However, Twitch somehow got away with it.

326
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:55,209
Rym: I'm confident that YouTube will be able to similarly get away with it.

327
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,087
Scott: Yeah, if they want to.

328
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,190
Rym: Well, they have to or Twitch is dead.

329
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,290
Scott: Yeah, we'll see what happens.

330
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:06,089
Scott: You know what I'm really curious about that no one's discussing, assuming this happens, what about Justin TV, right?

331
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,050
Rym: Justin TV is dead.

332
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:11,409
Scott: Right, Twitch is Justin TV.

333
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:14,969
Scott: And Justin TV made Twitch and then Twitch got bigger than Justin TV.

334
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,310
Scott: So that's probably going to be... There's still people on there.

335
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,950
Scott: It's still got a community of users and stuff, but it's probably going to die-die.

336
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,650
Scott: Like, really die.

337
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,710
Rym: Yup, because now...

338
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:28,450
Scott: Like, delicious.

339
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:29,770
Rym: Now, it's interesting.

340
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,270
Rym: So the most up-to-date article we have here says a few things.

341
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:39,409
Rym: So update number one, the acquisition talks are "at an early stage and the deal is not

342
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:39,670
Rym: imminent.".

343
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:41,989
Rym: Imminent, according to the Wall Street Journal.

344
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:42,443
Rym: Okay.

345
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,250
Rym: Citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

346
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:46,628
Scott: Okay.

347
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:47,870
Rym: Usually those are legit.

348
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,510
Rym: Two, Twitch supposedly evaluated multiple bids.

349
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,750
Rym: Microsoft was probably the second bidder.

350
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,910
Rym: Like, the second highest bidder.

351
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,685
Scott: That would have been dangerous, because suddenly it can only Twitch from Windows and Xbox.

352
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:02,004
Rym: Yeah.

353
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,487
Rym: Though the thing is, the Twitch people...

354
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,787
Scott: And Windows phones, not iPhones.

355
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,130
Rym: The Twitch people who run official events seem to use Wirecast for everything.

356
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:10,089
Scott: Okay.

357
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,349
Rym: Direct.

358
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:12,330
Scott: Alright.

359
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,469
Rym: Blah, blah, blah.

360
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,150
Rym: Twitch decided on Google's YouTube as it believes the company will be the best fit.

361
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:19,349
Rym: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

362
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:19,750
Rym: Probably.

363
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:24,750
Scott: I mean, if they sell for a billion dollars, how much was the initial funding on Twitch?

364
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:25,850
Rym: I don't even know.

365
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,390
Scott: They're going to probably make, like, at least 3X, if not more.

366
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,209
Rym: The thing is, I'm confident that none of the people who will cash out on this are going to cash out and go to the beach.

367
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:40,730
Scott: I think no one's going to go to the beach except for some VC people.

368
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:41,190
Rym: Yeah.

369
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:43,610
Rym: VC people seem to never go to the beach, though.

370
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,489
Scott: I don't understand them.

371
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,409
Rym: They suckle that.

372
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,590
Rym: They make trillion dollars and then they die all day.

373
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,750
Scott: All the money they're going to make on Twitch, they lost on all those other stupid startups.

374
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,670
Scott: So, really, they're just going to finally break even when Twitch sells.

375
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,789
Scott: It's one of those... It's like, think about it.

376
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,744
Scott: Everyone's like, "You're going to be the next

377
00:18:58,784 --> 00:18:59,149
Scott: Facebook.".

378
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,510
Scott: Well, let's see.

379
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,749
Scott: How many Facebooks have there been?

380
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:01,750
Scott: Facebook?

381
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,007
Scott: Twitch?

382
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:03,934
Rym: What?

383
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:04,429
Rym: Not Orkut?

384
00:19:04,596 --> 00:19:04,910
Rym: Twitter?

385
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,628
Scott: There's been like six?

386
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,550
Scott: Except maybe, right?

387
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,470
Scott: It's like there's been less than ten.

388
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:12,330
Rym: Well, I mean, what about like Instagram?

389
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,123
Rym: Okay.

390
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,790
Rym: You know WhatsApp, which I'm going to sound like an old man.

391
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,021
Scott: Nope.

392
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:20,129
Rym: I didn't know what WhatsApp was until like a month ago.

393
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:21,570
Rym: Because I just ignored it.

394
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:22,129
Scott: It's pay Twitter.

395
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,609
Rym: It's not even pay Twitter.

396
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:28,210
Rym: It's Alenston Messenger is back as a new app that costs money.

397
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:36,209
Rym: I can't imagine who would use it except suddenly everyone in the financial world is like asking me what my WhatsApp ID is.

398
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,021
Rym: And I'm like, "What the fuck,

399
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:38,344
Rym: dude?".

400
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:40,924
Rym: People, I was like...

401
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,110
Scott: You should have been like, "Oh, I don't have one.

402
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:43,721
Scott: What's your Orkut

403
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:43,864
Scott: ID?"?

404
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:44,264
Scott: Yeah.

405
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,125
Rym: I was like, "What's your live

406
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:46,428
Rym: journal?".

407
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:47,482
Scott: "What's your Friendster

408
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:47,644
Scott: ID?".

409
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:49,542
Rym: "What's your

410
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:49,829
Rym: myspace?".

411
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,681
Rym: "What's your ICQ

412
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:51,026
Rym: number?"?

413
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:51,352
Rym: Oh.

414
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:52,988
Scott: Your favorite.

415
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:56,346
Rym: Oh, I think I might have forgotten it.

416
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:56,710
Rym: finally.

417
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:57,389
Rym: I know mine.

418
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,170
Scott: Mine's longer though.

419
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:01,188
Rym: I had a six digit one.

420
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:02,928
Scott: Cognac stock photo.

421
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,073
Scott: Mine's 93572776.

422
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,950
Rym: I think mine was 15036112.

423
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,968
Scott: Why'd you type ICWQ?

424
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,003
Rym: And then the one before... Yes!

425
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,530
Scott: Oh, wait.

426
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:18,630
Scott: Oh, cities.

427
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,070
Scott: Rims never to be finished or even worked on page.

428
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:24,309
Rym: That was a page that I had to build for RIT.

429
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:26,088
Rym: Let's see if it comes up.

430
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,229
Rym: Oh my God.

431
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,009
Rym: Rims lair.

432
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:30,769
Rym: So this assignment I had to make...

433
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:32,290
Scott: Find Rims lair, everybody.

434
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:38,210
Rym: I had to make a graphic that had a text overlay and I had to provide some text.

435
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,449
Rym: Oh my God, are the pictures there?

436
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:42,370
Scott: What are the pictures?

437
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,210
Scott: Oh, it's the Rims stand up comedy Seinfeld picture with the trumpet.

438
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:48,590
Rym: And it's the Rims actually playing his trumpet.

439
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:49,889
Scott: Yep.

440
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:50,326
Scott: That's it.

441
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:51,869
Rym: The third one's broken.

442
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:52,668
Scott: What, what?

443
00:20:53,592 --> 00:20:53,908
Scott: I wonder what...

444
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:54,302
Rym: Oh no, it's not!

445
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,490
Rym: It's me and a sword.

446
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:57,730
Scott: I've seen all these pictures before.

447
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,848
Rym: Yeah, there's nothing new.

448
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,936
Rym: You should edit that page and add TRM.

449
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,168
Rym: I should add... No, I don't even know how the fuck I could edit this.

450
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,030
Scott: Log into Oocities or whatever the fuck that is.

451
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,050
Rym: I should add this to my LinkedIn profile.

452
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:11,688
Rym: Do it!

453
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,990
Rym: And see if anyone notices.

454
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,310
Scott: Search for mine.

455
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,990
Scott: 935 72776.

456
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,267
Rym: What was that?

457
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:21,450
Rym: 935 72776.

458
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,270
Rym: Man, you came way late to the party.

459
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,422
Scott: Space ICQ.

460
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,059
Scott: Yep.

461
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:28,350
Rym: I had a lower number because I got in way early.

462
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,510
Rym: So, your profile on the Ubuntu forums.

463
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:31,069
Rym: Okay.

464
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,089
Rym: Your TeamSpeak community forum.

465
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:33,606
Scott: Nice.

466
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,421
Rym: And you have a user profile on CX7 Club.

467
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,509
Scott: I have no idea what the fuck CX7 Club is.

468
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:39,107
Rym: We'll find out.

469
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,790
Rym: CX7 Club, it says you're in Beacon, New York.

470
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:44,768
Rym: You have 13 posts here.

471
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,404
Scott: Is the CX7...

472
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,230
Rym: You were born on April 30th in 1982.

473
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,890
Rym: You joined this in 2006.

474
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,809
Scott: Oh, you know what that might be?

475
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,630
Rym: Ford Fusion.

476
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,270
Scott: Yeah, that's a forum for, remember I had the Mazda, right?

477
00:21:56,374 --> 00:21:56,770
Rym: Oh yeah.

478
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,430
Scott: See, they're referring to Mazda CX7.

479
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,750
Rym: It says you're a moped rider.

480
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,470
Scott: Yeah, because that's the ranking of how many posts you've had.

481
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,270
Rym: I love how moped rider is the lowest.

482
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:12,508
Scott: I posted in this forum when it was still the Mazda 3 Club about how to attach the iPod thing back to the car.

483
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,510
Rym: It says you last visited this on April 30th, 2013.

484
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,309
Scott: Yeah, no.

485
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:19,169
Scott: That's not true.

486
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:19,735
Rym: At 1044 AM.

487
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:21,569
Scott: That is not true.

488
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,470
Rym: That's what it says here.

489
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:22,990
Scott: That's wrong.

490
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,124
Rym: You posted 13 times.

491
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,549
Rym: Oh, I can find your posts.

492
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:26,649
Scott: Yeah, go for it.

493
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:27,508
Rym: I got to be logged in.

494
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:28,970
Scott: You can make an account.

495
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:29,730
Rym: Let's see.

496
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:30,469
Rym: TeamSpeak.

497
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:32,150
Rym: No recent activity.

498
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,650
Scott: It was probably like how to set up TeamSpeak server, how this works.

499
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:41,410
Rym: Whoa, someone named Stefan Mildred visited your profile page for TeamSpeak recently.

500
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:41,990
Scott: Okay.

501
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,010
Scott: What's up, Stefan?

502
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:47,475
Rym: You last posted in 2004.

503
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:48,490
Rym: And your Ubuntu forums.

504
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,329
Rym: You have five cups of Ubuntu.

505
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,209
Scott: Okay.

506
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:52,168
Rym: All right.

507
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:52,990
Rym: That was interesting.

508
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:55,609
Scott: Let's move on to a different tech news.

509
00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:56,590
Rym: All right.

510
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,670
Rym: Well, the last thing about tech news is that this obviously has antitrust implications.

511
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:03,198
Scott: Yeah.

512
00:23:04,414 --> 00:23:05,810
Rym: So, we'll see what comes of that.

513
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,146
Scott: Wait.

514
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,405
Scott: For each news, let's do a scale.

515
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:11,349
Scott: How much was that actually tech news?

516
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:19,189
Rym: This one, I'm going to say 50% because there's the architecture infrastructure backend side, especially if I say a little bit more.

517
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,710
Rym: YouTube has way more capacity than Twitch.

518
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:26,570
Rym: And Twitch has had bandwidth issues for me often.

519
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:31,310
Rym: Also, Twitch limits uploads to a pitiful amount of MBPS.

520
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,970
Rym: I can upload at 50 megabits per second per camera, YouTube.

521
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,830
Scott: My camera can take in 200 ridiculous amount, right?

522
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:44,109
Rym: I maxed out my Fios pipe once to YouTube just to see if it would work, and it totally worked.

523
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:46,689
Scott: Yeah.

524
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:59,149
Scott: So, I'd say it's a lot of tech news, mostly because even though it's really a business news, it creates a lot of concerns for technologists who are streaming video because pretty much these are your options for streaming video.

525
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,150
Scott: I really wish Vimeo would step into the streaming game.

526
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:10,360
Rym: It's interesting though because YouTube, despite having the live events, is really only used by big convention events.

527
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,870
Rym: that will have our special thing and not nerdy stuff.

528
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,108
Rym: It's interesting how nerdy people don't use the YouTube streaming even though it's pretty much better in every way technologically.

529
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:19,990
Scott: They just don't know how.

530
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,498
Rym: Yeah.

531
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:22,149
Scott: YouTube doesn't market it well.

532
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,850
Scott: That's probably why they're buying Twitch.

533
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,530
Rym: But Twitch, I wonder if they're going to keep the Twitch brand.

534
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,849
Scott: You can't get rid of the Twitch brand.

535
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:32,410
Rym: There's debate as to whether or not they're going to keep it.

536
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,369
Scott: You can call YouTube Twitch.

537
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:40,048
Rym: I also wonder if they're going to keep the sort of walled off video game or gaming only area.

538
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:42,009
Scott: I don't know.

539
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:42,986
Scott: We'll see.

540
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,770
Rym: Because that's the one thing where you're thinking about streaming.

541
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,630
Scott: If they do anything, it'll be long term and slow gradual.

542
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,269
Rym: Yup, because they can't fuck up Twitch.

543
00:24:49,476 --> 00:24:49,590
Rym: Right.

544
00:24:49,631 --> 00:24:52,629
Rym: Even though I foresee... People will just bail and make something new.

545
00:24:53,010 --> 00:25:00,930
Rym: I foresee an exodus of nerds who say they're going to stop using Twitch because they're afraid, who then realize there's nowhere else to go and come back.

546
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:01,516
Scott: Yup.

547
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:06,847
Scott: Or someone will make their own thing and it'll be really shitty, like all those people who try to make not Facebooks.

548
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:07,284
Rym: Yup.

549
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,189
Scott: And then, yeah, those never work.

550
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,209
Rym: So, kind of a fun one.

551
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:17,270
Rym: Emory University apparently accidentally, I'm going to read a summary from this TNW website.

552
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:25,550
Rym: Quote, "A Windows 7 deployment image was accidentally sent to all Windows machines, including laptops, desktops, and servers.

553
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,449
Rym: This image started with a repartitioned reformat.

554
00:25:29,512 --> 00:25:32,970
Rym: As soon as the accident was discovered, the SSCM server was powered off.

555
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,747
Rym: However, by that time, the SSCM server had itself been repartitioned and

556
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:38,450
Rym: reformatted.".

557
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:41,250
Rym: That last sentence is probably the funniest part.

558
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:42,349
Scott: What's the SSCM?

559
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:43,810
Rym: I guess that's the software they used.

560
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:46,790
Rym: I used to use, when I worked at IBM, that was one of my jobs.

561
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,528
Scott: But powering it off is not going to stop the machines from...

562
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:55,350
Rym: Yeah, I'm ignoring the fact that people don't know how to troubleshoot issues like this.

563
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,790
Scott: That might actually fuck them up because they're trying to re-image the image they can't download anymore or something.

564
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,190
Rym: Yeah, but there's a couple morals here.

565
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:03,609
Rym: One, back stuff up.

566
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:12,170
Rym: Two, you've got to assume that at any second of any day, a hobo could run into your apartment and stick a knife into every hard drive in your computer.

567
00:26:13,017 --> 00:26:13,429
Scott: Pretty much.

568
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,888
Rym: Those are pretty much the... Emily is laughing really loud at that.

569
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:17,849
Scott: You've got to go farther than that, right?

570
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,670
Scott: Imaging software is used in places that have large deployments of computers, usually, right?

571
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:25,290
Scott: And it's really great for solving problems.

572
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,742
Scott: Like, "My computer's all fucked up.

573
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:27,530
Scott: It's full of malware.

574
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,347
Scott: Okay, I'll just push a button from my desk in

575
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:29,569
Scott: IT.".

576
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,449
Scott: And you're fixed.

577
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,030
Rym: Yep, because your home directory, all your files, they're on some sand somewhere.

578
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,130
Scott: Right, it doesn't even matter.

579
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:43,910
Scott: Basically, if your computer has any sort of imaging software installed on it, you have to assume that hobo is living in the computer, right?

580
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,530
Scott: And he's just waiting.

581
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:46,570
Rym: He's been living there for a long time.

582
00:26:47,562 --> 00:26:47,890
Rym: You know what?

583
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,230
Rym: You know how hard drives die?

584
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,350
Rym: You can hear him sharpening his knife when you're accessing data.

585
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,809
Scott: That software is the hobo.

586
00:26:54,230 --> 00:27:02,029
Scott: So if you've got that software because you're at a school or a business that has it, do not store anything on any hard drive in that computer whatsoever, ever.

587
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:06,490
Scott: Keep everything on USB sticks or on network drives or something.

588
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:14,430
Scott: Because even though every Windows computer on their network got formatted, I highly doubt that their NAS or their storage solutions were completely reformatted.

589
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:23,710
Scott: Though, I have seen incidents where someone has a mounted device and- That ends up being where the OS goes because it's the first device when the thing reboots?

590
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:29,110
Rym: No, but just that the software that was doing some task like this- Formats all drives in the computer?

591
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,310
Rym: Yes, has permission to delete files and in some sort of replication.

592
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:38,050
Rym: Like say it's replicating a computer to a backup site and does a two-way replication.

593
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:41,030
Rym: So someone updates one, it'll replicate across and back.

594
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,129
Rym: Like wikis and things will do this.

595
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:49,670
Rym: I've seen situations where the things were mounted on NASes for protection and the replication was intended for other purposes.

596
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,490
Rym: Someone unmounts it by accident on one side.

597
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,730
Rym: The other side then replicates the blank one onto the mount, destroying everything.

598
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,147
Scott: Don't fuck up.

599
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,670
Rym: I've seen that happen more than once in my life.

600
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:09,630
Scott: Number one, I hope that from this situation a lot of people there can learn a lesson of using cloud storage.

601
00:28:11,214 --> 00:28:13,169
Scott: Learn how their computer works and why it fucked up.

602
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:20,089
Scott: But they'll probably just blame IT and be, even though they're at a university, be anti-intellectual and say they don't have to learn anything about computers, fuck you.

603
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,830
Scott: And there's probably some professor who's so mad about losing his research that he's just in a blind rage and doesn't care.

604
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:36,950
Rym: Two, if you're in school or you're learning IT, a thing that you should really learn is not just the general concepts, but learn a couple of the specific software packages that are used to image computers.

605
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,630
Rym: Because knowing how that shit works can get you a job so fast.

606
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:44,770
Rym: That was one of my jobs at IBM.

607
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:54,850
Rym: A good example of how to use this stuff was the factory had these computers that people would use to go to a web page and enter data while they're doing their work, like scanning barcodes and the kind of stuff you do in a factory.

608
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:00,450
Rym: So I made these computers that were running Linux and they didn't have any local data.

609
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:04,570
Rym: It was basically just a web browser with predefined shortcuts.

610
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,390
Rym: So if anything went wrong with one at all, I would just send an image to it.

611
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:10,769
Rym: And if that didn't fix it, I would just physically replace it.

612
00:29:12,957 --> 00:29:14,010
Rym: I just find this story hilarious.

613
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,480
Scott: On the scale of "Is that tech

614
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:16,721
Scott: news?"

615
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:17,566
Scott: I would say very much.

616
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:18,330
Scott: that's tech news.

617
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,239
Rym: Yeah, that's 100% tech news.

618
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:21,350
Scott: 90% tech news.

619
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,261
Rym: Well, because all things...

620
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:24,341
Scott: It's 10%.

621
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:25,450
Scott: "Look, someone was stupid" news.

622
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,157
Rym: 9% that and 1%.

623
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:29,767
Rym: "Ah, the solipsistic doubts of all

624
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:30,188
Rym: things.".

625
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,010
Scott: Sure.

626
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:36,350
Rym: So, the Lithuanian mob was caught smuggling cigarettes into Russia using remote-controlled drones.

627
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,179
Scott: That's not...

628
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:40,590
Rym: My hat is off to you, Lithuanian mob.

629
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,590
Scott: My hat is off to you, drone-using mob.

630
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:52,370
Rym: Technologically, this is a tech issue in the sense that this technology is moving way faster than people realize.

631
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:57,850
Scott: But, see, with other sort of... I guess you can view this as a hacking attempt, right?

632
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,490
Scott: It's like the bad guys have found a way around the law, right?

633
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,030
Scott: They've found a way to skirt the defenses.

634
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:09,030
Scott: But it's not a situation where there's some really smart nerd at DEF CON and the FBI can't figure out what he's doing.

635
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,177
Scott: This is, "Oh, they're using drones.

636
00:30:11,538 --> 00:30:12,622
Scott: We already know the answer to that.

637
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:13,807
Scott: Shoot the drones down.

638
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:14,208
Rym: Boom.

639
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:14,549
Rym: Done.".

640
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,596
Rym: And actually, that's hard.

641
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:17,670
Rym: They're too small to be picked up by radar, usually.

642
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,370
Rym: They're tiny.

643
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,029
Scott: Use a gun.

644
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:21,990
Rym: Have you ever fired a gun, Scott?

645
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:22,496
Scott: Yeah.

646
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,950
Rym: You're gonna shoot a drone that just kind of... You don't even know where the drones are.

647
00:30:26,732 --> 00:30:27,638
Scott: It's like skeet shooting.

648
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:28,906
Scott: A drone is bigger than a skeet.

649
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:29,430
Scott: Use a shotgun.

650
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,571
Rym: Yes.

651
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:31,670
Rym: How do you know where the drone is in a giant forest?

652
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,350
Scott: You know it's somewhere on the border with Lithuania.

653
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:35,468
Rym: No, you don't.

654
00:30:35,972 --> 00:30:37,130
Scott: It's a Lithuanian mob.

655
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,350
Scott: They caught one by accident.

656
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:39,530
Rym: Lithuania's really small.

657
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,333
Rym: All right, Scott.

658
00:30:40,634 --> 00:30:44,090
Rym: You, how many people would you need to prevent drones from getting over the East River?

659
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:45,910
Scott: Over the East River?

660
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:46,739
Rym: At any point.

661
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:49,671
Rym: 24/7.

662
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:53,170
Scott: Only next to Manhattan versus Long Island geographically?

663
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,908
Rym: Yeah, just Manhattan.

664
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,707
Scott: Not the northern...

665
00:30:54,831 --> 00:30:55,330
Rym: Just Manhattan.

666
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,329
Scott: I'd probably do, like, five or six big boats that had, like, auto turrets on them.

667
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:06,350
Rym: Yes, because auto turrets within firing distance of the windows of Manhattan is an excellent idea.

668
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,699
Scott: Well, they'd be firing shotguns.

669
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,130
Scott: It's not like a little shop pallet's gonna hurt you.

670
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:18,490
Rym: But I guess what I think... This story kind of points out that right now, despite the laws and regulations that are coming around this, smart nerds can make drones do really cool stuff.

671
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:19,048
Scott: Oh, yeah.

672
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:28,510
Rym: And I look forward to the crazy crap that's gonna start happening when, like, high school pranks involve a drone flying into the school and dropping stink bombs everywhere.

673
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,690
Scott: I've been surprised, right?

674
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,410
Scott: It's like I've seen a lot of drones used for cameras a lot.

675
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,830
Rym: Well, there's that guy who flew around New York City.

676
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:36,968
Scott: Yeah, you're allowed to.

677
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,523
Rym: No, you're all, "That's

678
00:31:38,604 --> 00:31:39,029
Rym: debatable.".

679
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,190
Scott: No, there was a guy... That's another news.

680
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,330
Rym: Yes, it is debatable, though.

681
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,430
Scott: Anyway, but I'm surprised I haven't seen them used for more just, like, fun things.

682
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:54,990
Scott: Like, you've never gone to, like, a concert and a drone flies around, you know, dropping confetti on everybody.

683
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,170
Rym: Partly because they can't carry much of a payload yet.

684
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,866
Scott: You get a lot of them.

685
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:01,529
Rym: Yeah, but then they're likely to fall into the crowd.

686
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:07,309
Scott: Or, like, you have something really high up, like a confetti cannon, and a drone flies up there to trigger it instead of...

687
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,409
Rym: Yeah, because that's so much more effective than wireless.

688
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,090
Rym: That's so much more... It's more epic.

689
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:24,329
Scott: Or, like, you're at, I don't know, the sea lion show at the aquarium, and they put the beach ball on the drone, and then the sea lion jumps up and hits it.

690
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,901
Rym: So, there's a pedophile.

691
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:27,969
Rym: I'm slashed off.

692
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:30,457
Scott: How much tech news was your drone?

693
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:31,501
Scott: Not much tech news.

694
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:34,090
Scott: I mean, they used drones, but other than that, it was crime news.

695
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:38,070
Rym: But that drone technology as a discussion is primarily technological.

696
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,510
Scott: Sure, but the news... I'm talking about the quality of the news on its own.

697
00:32:41,591 --> 00:32:42,749
Rym: The technology has gotten...

698
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:45,570
Scott: We're gonna make a technology discussion no matter what the news is.

699
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,750
Rym: The technology has gotten good enough...

700
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,230
Scott: We can have news about squirrels in the park and make it technological.

701
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:55,030
Rym: The technology has gotten good enough to have autonomous drones delivering contraband over borders.

702
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:55,678
Scott: Yep.

703
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:05,410
Rym: That's relatively recent in terms of carrying capacity, GPS capabilities, being able to operate without line of sight.

704
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,017
Scott: I wonder what kind of drones they're using.

705
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:09,970
Scott: Is it, like, the octocopters with the eight blades?

706
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:10,534
Rym: Let's see.

707
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:11,742
Rym: Russia detained it.

708
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:12,750
Rym: Let's see if there's a picture of it.

709
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,437
Scott: Eight rotors?

710
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:14,249
Scott: Or a six?

711
00:33:15,931 --> 00:33:17,562
Rym: Alright, that's just a picture of cigarettes.

712
00:33:17,723 --> 00:33:18,650
Rym: Thank you, news article.

713
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,207
Scott: That was really helpful.

714
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,404
Rym: That was great.

715
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:23,393
Scott: Okay.

716
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:24,230
Rym: Let's continue.

717
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,994
Rym: Blah, blah, blah.

718
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:28,069
Rym: Doesn't say what kind... Oh, oh, oh, oh, here we go.

719
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,949
Rym: It was established that the aircraft with a wing spread of four meters...

720
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:33,309
Scott: Oh, so it's like a real drone.

721
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,570
Rym: Had been made in Lithuania and was radio-controlled from Earth.

722
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,490
Scott: Yeah, this isn't like, you know, a drone you buy at the store.

723
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:40,688
Rym: This is like a real one.

724
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:42,090
Scott: A GPS system was built into it.

725
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,350
Scott: That's the kind that they use in the military and shit.

726
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:47,190
Rym: A drone operator probably controlled the flight from a PC somewhere.

727
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:50,550
Rym: The drone could carry ten fucking kilograms of cargo.

728
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,877
Scott: Yeah, this is a real drone.

729
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:55,242
Scott: Like, the ones... Yeah, so... How do you even get one of those?

730
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:55,850
Scott: Those are not cheap.

731
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:56,655
Rym: You know what?

732
00:33:56,897 --> 00:33:58,069
Rym: If you know enough, just build it.

733
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,250
Scott: You know, we could just go to, like, Afghanistan and, like, steal some.

734
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,033
Scott: As the U.S.

735
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:05,690
Scott: is flying them, we can, like, interfere with them and get them to crash and take them.

736
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:08,083
Rym: That's supposedly what Iran did to that one.

737
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:09,230
Rym: That's a very dubious story.

738
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,467
Scott: I'm sure that story sounds dubious, but, I mean, we could probably get away with it.

739
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,119
Scott: Well, how do we get away with it?

740
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,489
Scott: But we could accomplish it if we really tried.

741
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,989
Rym: Well, we're not going to get away with it now.

742
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,090
Scott: No, but we could accomplish it if we tried with all our might.

743
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:21,969
Rym: And we hadn't said that just now.

744
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,237
Scott: Yes, that is true.

745
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,650
Scott: We're never going to go to Afghanistan in our lives.

746
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,909
Rym: So, anyway, back to the pedophile.

747
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:29,569
Scott: Already, this pedophile news doesn't sound like tech news.

748
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:35,409
Rym: A pedophile has asked to be deleted from a Google search after a European court ruling.

749
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:39,810
Scott: Okay, so it's part law news, part crime news, part tech news.

750
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,231
Rym: Yep.

751
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:41,750
Rym: Well, this is a long-standing debate.

752
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:46,570
Rym: There's this debate in Europe about the so-called right to be forgotten.

753
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,989
Scott: There is no right to be forgotten.

754
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,850
Rym: Yeah, so Europe wants to make it a law that you have a right to be forgotten on the internet.

755
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,330
Rym: Meaning that, say Scott...

756
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,629
Scott: Well, fuck you and your unenforceable law.

757
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:00,950
Rym: Let's say Scott posts a picture on my forum of himself naked, like, dancing on top of a donkey.

758
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:01,469
Scott: Okay.

759
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:06,105
Rym: Then 10 years later, he emails me and says, "Yeah, that was a long time ago.

760
00:35:06,265 --> 00:35:07,248
Rym: Please remove that

761
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:07,549
Rym: image.".

762
00:35:08,195 --> 00:35:09,129
Rym: Uh, no.

763
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:11,790
Rym: Europe wants to make it a crime for me to not remove that image.

764
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:18,130
Rym: On the grounds that it was a long time ago, he has a right for information about him to be removed from the internet.

765
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,302
Scott: Alright, you know what I had to say to that?

766
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:19,929
Scott: Make me.

767
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:21,842
Rym: Oh, you can't.

768
00:35:22,306 --> 00:35:22,629
Rym: Good luck.

769
00:35:23,392 --> 00:35:24,358
Rym: So, this is Europe.

770
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:26,350
Rym: Remember, Europe is a place where...

771
00:35:26,411 --> 00:35:27,730
Scott: Where they don't have freedom of speech, yeah.

772
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:37,770
Rym: And also, if you go to any website, a giant banner appears by law that informs you with a lot of text that this website uses cookies!

773
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:39,290
Scott: Oh my god, cookies!

774
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,409
Rym: It's a crime to not tell you about the cookies!

775
00:35:42,597 --> 00:35:42,820
Scott: Cookie!

776
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,328
Scott: Nom nom nom nom.

777
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:51,590
Rym: The European Union, in terms of the internet, makes me terrified that they will get any more control of the internet away from the United States.

778
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:53,869
Scott: And this is just another example of it.

779
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,970
Scott: And look how bad the United States is at internet.

780
00:35:56,536 --> 00:35:57,102
Scott: The EU is even worse.

781
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,369
Rym: We're bad and we're the best.

782
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,214
Scott: That's right.

783
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:01,970
Scott: That's usually how the world is.

784
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,150
Scott: The US is bad and awful at things and still better than everyone else at the same time.

785
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,930
Rym: Now, there are still places where you can advocate for privacy rights and privacy.

786
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,430
Rym: There are privacy rights that could make sense both technologically and ideologically and pragmatically.

787
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,810
Rym: However, the right to be forgotten is not one of them.

788
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:20,090
Scott: It is not even a right.

789
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,956
Rym: Information exists.

790
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:24,750
Rym: The only way to fight information is with more information.

791
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:41,870
Rym: So, for example, maybe you could argue that in a high-profile website, like a journalistic organization, there could be a rule that forces an old article called "About a Crime" to have an update or a note added to it if someone was later exonerated.

792
00:36:42,755 --> 00:36:43,164
Scott: Uh, sure.

793
00:36:43,205 --> 00:36:43,348
Scott: Why not?

794
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:44,729
Rym: I'd be okay with that.

795
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,406
Scott: What's wrong with that?

796
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:45,966
Scott: Nothing.

797
00:36:46,391 --> 00:36:46,989
Rym: Yep, exactly.

798
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,621
Rym: Unless you're trying to, well, whatever.

799
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:50,850
Rym: There's no good argument against it.

800
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,769
Rym: I can come up with a lot of specious arguments against it.

801
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,547
Scott: Well, I mean, you could argue, "It's my website.

802
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:56,070
Scott: You can't force...".

803
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,750
Scott: I mean, it's basically the same defense for both situations, right?

804
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,896
Scott: It's like, "It's my website.

805
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:01,163
Scott: If I don't want to edit it, I don't have to.

806
00:37:01,183 --> 00:37:02,490
Scott: I can write anything I want on my website.

807
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,630
Scott: You can't force me to write something additional on my website just as much as you can't force me to delete something on my website.

808
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:08,455
Scott: It's my website.

809
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:09,624
Scott: I put there what I want.

810
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:09,826
Scott: Fuck

811
00:37:09,866 --> 00:37:09,967
Scott: you.".

812
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:18,410
Rym: But basically, this whole debate is coming around this fundamental divide between what people want technology to do and what technology is.

813
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:25,790
Rym: The sheer technology that the picture is digital means that it will exist forever and will be public forever.

814
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:35,630
Scott: I think the problem is you have people who are very unskilled and unknowledgeable, but they are doing things that have full life consequences.

815
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:44,126
Scott: Well... So they fuck up because they suck, and then later when they learn that they fucked up, they want to undo, and it's like, "No.

816
00:37:44,608 --> 00:37:44,888
Scott: It's a

817
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:45,450
Scott: consequence.".

818
00:37:47,496 --> 00:37:50,223
Scott: I see there are two kinds of problems in this world, right?

819
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:52,710
Scott: The first kind of problem is...

820
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,169
Rym: Only two kinds.

821
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,571
Scott: Right.

822
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:55,137
Scott: This is a real problem.

823
00:37:55,177 --> 00:37:57,346
Scott: Like, "I have a problem, and I need to solve it.

824
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:58,090
Scott: What do I do to get it out of this

825
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,190
Scott: time?".

826
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,428
Scott: You want to know what the problem is?

827
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,031
Scott: Right.

828
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:05,185
Scott: The other kind of problem is, "I have already fucked up, and I am suffering consequences.

829
00:38:05,505 --> 00:38:06,669
Scott: How do I alleviate these

830
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:07,210
Scott: consequences?".

831
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,595
Scott: And the answer to that is you don't.

832
00:38:08,635 --> 00:38:10,802
Scott: They're consequences of the thing you already did.

833
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:11,625
Scott: You suffer.

834
00:38:12,187 --> 00:38:12,970
Scott: There's no solving.

835
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,554
Rym: So Scott, I cut my hand.

836
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:19,588
Rym: To alleviate the consequences of cutting my hand, I put some balm on it and abandoned it.

837
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:20,430
Scott: How is that wrong?

838
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,639
Scott: Your hand will never be restored to what it originally was.

839
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,410
Scott: You have a full life consequence of this scar on your hand that cannot be undone.

840
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,498
Rym: That's a small cut.

841
00:38:28,578 --> 00:38:29,830
Rym: There might not be a scar.

842
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,077
Scott: You might get lucky.

843
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:33,450
Scott: It wasn't a major fuck up, right?

844
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,285
Rym: What if in the future we have technology to completely undo my cut?

845
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:37,050
Rym: That'll happen.

846
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:41,210
Scott: Sure, but there might still be a consequence of having to pay for the use of that technology.

847
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,170
Rym: No, universal healthcare, post-care, it's a new society.

848
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,324
Scott: You still have to use... Well, I mean, there's still... Then you didn't fuck up, did you?

849
00:38:47,344 --> 00:38:49,050
Scott: You didn't cut yourself on purpose.

850
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,553
Rym: I think there's a more nuanced point here.

851
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:57,470
Rym: We are in a liminality right now between... People talk about a new world order or technological singularity.

852
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:20,450
Rym: The biggest and most important one in the world right now is that we're at this dividing line between a world where most of what you did in your life up to this point is lost, save for the memories of people around you, and this world where every picture you ever took is on the internet forever, and every picture anyone ever took of you is on the internet forever, along with everything you ever posted to your live journal.

853
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:24,710
Scott: Right, and the solution is not to go back to the old world, because that is impossible.

854
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:30,510
Scott: The snake jumped out of the can and hit you in the face, and you can't put it back in, because damn, that can is small and that snake is long.

855
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,315
Rym: Yes, so in the past...

856
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:33,990
Scott: You have to deal with the world we have.

857
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:43,030
Rym: So as I'm saying, in the past, a politician who did something stupid as a child could still be elected if that information was obscure enough.

858
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:49,610
Rym: In the future, everyone did stupid shit as a child, and as a result, every politician has a picture of them with their dick out.

859
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:58,870
Scott: But we're in the world where half the politicians have pictures with their dicks out, and half of them don't know how to use the internet, and those are the ones that get elected because they don't have pictures of their dick out yet.

860
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,742
Scott: All the politicians don't know how to use the internet.

861
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:04,330
Scott: They're trying to keep it down.

862
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:10,650
Rym: This debate crystallizes exactly what that liminal place that we're in is.

863
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,530
Scott: I'm not too worried about this one, because this is one of those ones where it's when the old people die.

864
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:24,049
Rym: I was at a financial conference not that long ago, and this woman, who was a doctor in mathematics, she was talking all about old world...

865
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:24,690
Scott: A doctor of what?

866
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,875
Rym: Mathematics, something, PhD.

867
00:40:27,096 --> 00:40:34,170
Rym: She was talking about market structure and the way traders work and all these things, and she had this really long talk about all these really bad things that are happening.

868
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,042
Rym: And then she put up her slide, and she was like, "So what do we do about this?

869
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:38,067
Rym: How is this

870
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:38,489
Rym: fixed?".

871
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:44,970
Rym: And her next slide said the words that she then said out loud, one funeral at a time.

872
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:45,629
Scott: That's right.

873
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:50,465
Rym: And she went on to say, "These people, many of whom are at this conference, will never change.

874
00:40:51,067 --> 00:40:51,649
Rym: They cannot

875
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:52,050
Rym: change.".

876
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:52,447
Rym: That's right.

877
00:40:53,391 --> 00:41:00,830
Rym: The youth will have their own problems, but the only way to change these markets is to wait for the people who already control them to die of old age.

878
00:41:01,537 --> 00:41:02,029
Scott: Or murder them.

879
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,545
Rym: And people in the audience, there was grumbling.

880
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:04,988
Rym: It was hilarious.

881
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,149
Rym: Meanwhile, all the young people...

882
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,419
Scott: But I would be the biggest fan.

883
00:41:08,479 --> 00:41:09,970
Scott: I'm already the biggest fan of that lady.

884
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,304
Rym: So half the audience was like, "Oh, really?

885
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:13,089
Rym: Oh, I never...".

886
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:14,209
Rym: And the other half was like that.

887
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:19,222
Rym: No, the other half was just looking at each other like... Tee hee.

888
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:21,910
Rym: So, don't want to talk about this long.

889
00:41:22,255 --> 00:41:23,249
Scott: That was kind of tech news.

890
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:28,090
Rym: Yeah, that was pretty techy, because technology is forcing a huge societal change.

891
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:29,748
Scott: Tech plus law plus whatever.

892
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:35,210
Rym: So this one's pretty much just net neutrality tech law.

893
00:41:37,032 --> 00:41:41,929
Rym: There is legislation in the EU to enforce net neutrality, regardless of the debate of how effective it will be.

894
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:46,329
Rym: The UK is likely planning to veto it.

895
00:41:46,992 --> 00:41:49,070
Scott: They can just, one country can just veto all the other countries?

896
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:49,926
Rym: The EU's kind of...

897
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:52,370
Scott: Can't all the other countries agree to it?

898
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,707
Scott: And just like, "OK, UK, you don't get to do

899
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:55,049
Scott: anything?"

900
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,088
Scott: Or, "We'll force net neutrality on the UK even though you don't want

901
00:41:58,129 --> 00:41:58,169
Scott: it?".

902
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:05,310
Rym: So if laws are passed in the Eurozone, members have to implement their own legislation to do what those laws say within a certain amount of time.

903
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:13,186
Scott: Right, so I thought the point of the EU is that a whole bunch of European countries can force something upon other European countries that are in the EU.

904
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:19,450
Rym: I had this conversation with someone in Sweden a few days ago.

905
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:19,989
Scott: In the EU?

906
00:42:21,758 --> 00:42:21,929
Scott: Yes.

907
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,115
Scott: I don't know which countries.

908
00:42:23,155 --> 00:42:24,203
Scott: Some of the countries aren't in it.

909
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:25,290
Scott: I don't know which ones are in it.

910
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,290
Rym: Well, they're in the Schengen Zones.

911
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,365
Scott: I thought the UK actually wasn't in the EU because they still have pounds.

912
00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:30,410
Scott: They don't even use Euros, right?

913
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,125
Rym: Yeah, Sweden has their kronor still.

914
00:42:32,145 --> 00:42:32,750
Rym: They don't use Euros.

915
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:33,493
Scott: Really?

916
00:42:33,655 --> 00:42:35,410
Scott: But I thought if you're in the EU, you've got to use Euros.

917
00:42:35,835 --> 00:42:36,490
Rym: No, it's complicated.

918
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:36,882
Scott: OK.

919
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,150
Rym: In fact, in Europe, people take pounds and Euros.

920
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,090
Scott: And this is why I don't know, because it's fucking complicated.

921
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:47,230
Rym: And if you go to London, like if you go to Europe, they're different in terms of visas or the stamps in your passport.

922
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:49,037
Rym: But I went in in Sweden.

923
00:42:49,138 --> 00:42:50,041
Rym: They stamped me in.

924
00:42:50,062 --> 00:42:51,387
Rym: I left from Germany.

925
00:42:51,427 --> 00:42:52,110
Rym: They stamped me out.

926
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,090
Rym: There was no stamping in between Sweden and Germany.

927
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,190
Rym: But that was because of the Schengen Zone as well.

928
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:01,829
Rym: Anyway, so the conversation I had, I'm going to say to you what was said to me.

929
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,609
Rym: Wait, so one senator can just stop any law from passing if he wants to?

930
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:10,550
Scott: If he can stay up all fucking night, good luck.

931
00:43:11,011 --> 00:43:12,157
Rym: No, they don't, Scott.

932
00:43:12,177 --> 00:43:14,429
Rym: They just threaten to do it and then everyone backs down.

933
00:43:15,112 --> 00:43:16,249
Scott: Yeah, they should force him to do it.

934
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,445
Rym: Yeah, but that's politics.

935
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:17,770
Rym: Look at that.

936
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:18,941
Scott: I'd force him to do it every time.

937
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:19,589
Scott: I'd be like, all right.

938
00:43:20,052 --> 00:43:21,918
Scott: The nominal reason... Oh, you're not good.

939
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:22,587
Scott: Law passes.

940
00:43:22,648 --> 00:43:22,790
Scott: Done.

941
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:37,270
Rym: The nominal reason the UK is vetoing this is because it prevents them from blocking child pornography, which has been the argument that the UK has used for a significant percentage of internet restrictions over time.

942
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,970
Scott: That's not actually necessarily true, right?

943
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:53,470
Scott: Because, I mean, you could craft the net neutrality legislation in such... Well, first of all, you shouldn't... I mean, I don't want to say child pornography is good, but it's like you don't fight child pornography with censoring the internet.

944
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:54,530
Scott: That's not the right way.

945
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:55,070
Rym: Exactly.

946
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,090
Scott: But it's also impossible, right?

947
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:57,768
Rym: But this goes into the...

948
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:01,010
Scott: It's a waste of your effort, just like the war on drugs is a waste of effort, right?

949
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:17,530
Scott: But B, you could craft net neutrality legislation in such a way to say any legal traffic, which is sort of, even if you look at the stuff the FCC is doing now, they're saying any legal use in all their stuff about not allowing ISPs to block things.

950
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:19,105
Rym: Ah, so some countries...

951
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:31,930
Scott: You could say any legal internet traffic must be given equal priority, and then your country can still be an evil censoring non-First Amendment country and just block anything you don't want.

952
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:44,968
Scott: So anything that's either blocked or equal speed, and you still can't have fast and slow lanes, which would solve the problem of, you know, "Aha, the rich company gets all the internet, and the poor company, no one can visit their

953
00:44:44,988 --> 00:44:45,410
Scott: website.".

954
00:44:45,671 --> 00:44:49,769
Rym: Well, I think we need a more nuanced approach and a long-term approach in that...

955
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,158
Scott: Yeah, world free speech.

956
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:52,910
Scott: Fuck you, oppressionist countries.

957
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:56,590
Rym: There's two distinct use cases for the internet.

958
00:44:57,011 --> 00:44:59,030
Rym: One of them is high bandwidth, and one of them is low bandwidth.

959
00:44:59,391 --> 00:45:00,094
Rym: Here's my example.

960
00:45:00,355 --> 00:45:03,550
Rym: High bandwidth, playing games, watching videos, all that kind of stuff we do.

961
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,898
Scott: Games don't even need a lot of bandwidth.

962
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:06,530
Scott: It needs a lot of, you know, latency.

963
00:45:07,363 --> 00:45:07,790
Scott: Low latency.

964
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:13,059
Rym: I guess in terms of low bandwidth cases are things like, "I'm in North Korea.

965
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:13,624
Rym: I need to share

966
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:14,089
Rym: information.".

967
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:14,717
Rym: "I gotta text

968
00:45:14,757 --> 00:45:15,203
Rym: somebody.".

969
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:22,630
Rym: Yes, I'm sharing information in a raw form that is not video or other, like, extremely big blobs.

970
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:29,390
Rym: That one, the latter, the low bandwidth one, is way more important to society progressing, I think.

971
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:33,090
Rym: Because freedom of information is important.

972
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:44,788
Rym: Nerds really need to get on building a sort of ad hoc wireless ability to have that kind of internet anywhere, anytime, even with very high latency and very low bandwidth, to get around 80 steps of shit.

973
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:46,410
Scott: You know why it's hard to do that?

974
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,710
Rym: Because RF is hard as fuck.

975
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,323
Scott: Yeah, how's your microphone doing?

976
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,115
Scott: Yeah.

977
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:51,228
Scott: Did you get that shit yet?

978
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,230
Scott: No.

979
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:52,893
Scott: No?

980
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:53,337
Scott: Really?

981
00:45:53,357 --> 00:45:58,290
Scott: So you can't even get wireless microphones, and you want to set up a wireless mesh network over the whole world.

982
00:45:58,533 --> 00:45:58,746
Scott: Yes.

983
00:45:59,332 --> 00:45:59,688
Scott: Good luck.

984
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,529
Rym: Let's get on that.

985
00:46:01,498 --> 00:46:01,829
Scott: Good luck.

986
00:46:02,214 --> 00:46:03,470
Rym: That was half tech, half politics.

987
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:04,667
Scott: Yeah.

988
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:04,770
Scott: Okay.

989
00:46:05,353 --> 00:46:05,610
Rym: Alright.

990
00:46:06,592 --> 00:46:07,710
Rym: How much time do we have left to kill?

991
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:09,380
Rym: We've been talking for 46 minutes.

992
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,550
Rym: We can blow through the rest of these.

993
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:11,630
Scott: Let's do, like, two or three more.

994
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,390
Rym: AT&T buying DirecTV for -- so, you know, it's interesting.

995
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:16,069
Scott: That's hardly tech news.

996
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:16,725
Rym: It is.

997
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:20,070
Rym: However, YouTube's buying Twitch for $1 billion.

998
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:22,218
Rym: AT&T's buying DirecTV for $48.5 billion.

999
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,322
Scott: So, DirecTV is 48.5 Twitches.

1000
00:46:28,312 --> 00:46:29,479
Scott: Or, in other words, the NFL is 48.5 video games.

1001
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:32,850
Rym: I can spin this tech.

1002
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:43,970
Rym: From what I gather, DirecTV has a -- either growing more slowly or about to shrink user base, but it generates ludicrous amounts of cash.

1003
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:49,290
Scott: Yeah, so the reason DirecTV makes so much money is mostly because of this NFL Sunday ticket, right?

1004
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:53,630
Scott: So, basically, it's mostly sports, is most of their subscribers, right?

1005
00:46:53,630 --> 00:47:00,630
Scott: That's the reason you get DirecTV, is because in your area, shit's blacked out, or you really just got to fucking watch all the football.

1006
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:07,130
Scott: Did you know the red zone on DirecTV is not only the first red zone, it's older than the red zone you get on other channels.

1007
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:07,510
Scott: Really?

1008
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:13,889
Scott: If you have, like, Fios red zone, the guy that's on that red zone is a different guy than on the DirecTV red zone.

1009
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,270
Scott: It's a different red zone.

1010
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:18,630
Scott: The NFL Sunday ticket on DirecTV is, like, this huge fucking deal.

1011
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:24,770
Scott: It's way different than -- and it's not just, you know -- it's like my dad, he can see on his AT&T the red zone.

1012
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,469
Scott: He has AT&T U-verse, right?

1013
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:30,150
Scott: He can see the red zone, and he can see a lot of football games, right?

1014
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:32,249
Scott: He can't see every football game.

1015
00:47:32,692 --> 00:47:40,970
Scott: If you want to see literally every football game, you have to have -- the only way you can do it by sitting in one place is to have DirecTV, right?

1016
00:47:41,272 --> 00:47:42,068
Scott: So it's this big deal.

1017
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:55,622
Scott: And you know how this is, like, the reason AT&T is trying to buy them is because there's a term in the contract that says, "Oh, yeah, by the way, if the NFL cuts off this deal with you, we get to cut this off the purchase, because that's the reason we're buying

1018
00:47:55,662 --> 00:47:55,743
Scott: you.".

1019
00:47:57,032 --> 00:48:15,610
Scott: So AT&T is buying DirecTV mostly for that, get those subscribers, because U-verse is kind of small, but it's actually not that bad, and it's trying to fight back, and if it merges with DirecTV, it'll suddenly have this big user base, and it can come out and fight with the other cable companies, especially if Comcast and Time Warner merge, right?

1020
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:15,943
Scott: Oh, boy.

1021
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:18,130
Rym: So here's the scary thing.

1022
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:22,270
Scott: But here's the thing, DirecTV's problem is no internet, right?

1023
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,669
Scott: And at least at my parents' house, where they have U-verse, the internet ain't bad.

1024
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:30,204
Rym: Well, here's the scary thing, quote, "This deal will bring 20 million more U.S.

1025
00:48:30,546 --> 00:48:35,837
Rym: television subscribers under AT&T's roof, making it the second biggest TV provider behind

1026
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:36,142
Rym: Comcast.".

1027
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,337
Scott: Yep.

1028
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:39,210
Rym: So, monopoly time.

1029
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,490
Scott: Yeah, well, see, it's duopoly, I guess.

1030
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:41,848
Scott: Yup.

1031
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:42,590
Scott: Triop, whatever.

1032
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,326
Scott: But, yeah, it's like, you know, they need to compete.

1033
00:48:46,432 --> 00:48:51,310
Scott: If the other guy is so gigantic, you got to, you know, muscle up, and it's sort of a good combo there, right?

1034
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:56,169
Scott: It's like DirecTV gives AT&T the TV that it doesn't have, the content, right?

1035
00:48:57,332 --> 00:49:00,610
Scott: And AT&T gives DirecTV the internet that it doesn't have.

1036
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:01,389
Rym: Well, here's my trouble.

1037
00:49:02,512 --> 00:49:13,285
Rym: All these maneuvers around the cable networks and the television networks are kind of, that's the, this is why, for everyone who says, "Why can't I just watch my shows on the

1038
00:49:13,305 --> 00:49:13,628
Rym: internet?".

1039
00:49:14,092 --> 00:49:22,269
Rym: This is why there's so many old people, so many people who just don't understand technology, that for whatever reason, they're all still paying for TV, maybe for sports.

1040
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:23,769
Scott: You know how that problem will be solved?

1041
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:25,330
Rym: One funeral at a time.

1042
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:25,990
Scott: You got it.

1043
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:31,370
Rym: But right now, that is what's holding us back, that even as HBO, they're not stupid.

1044
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:38,610
Rym: They know that the internet is the future, that everyone would just pay whatever it took to watch the Game of Thrones just on the HBO website.

1045
00:49:38,912 --> 00:49:40,949
Scott: Or would just not pay and parrot it.

1046
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,170
Rym: But if they could pay, they probably would.

1047
00:49:43,593 --> 00:49:44,370
Scott: A lot of people would.

1048
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,489
Scott: There's a limit to how much people will pay, but yeah.

1049
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:47,199
Rym: Yeah, but people...

1050
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:49,510
Scott: I'm paying for Crunchyroll, right?

1051
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:56,070
Rym: People who are willing to pay for cable TV would probably be willing to pay similar amounts just to be able to watch all the shows.

1052
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:58,310
Scott: How many people pay for cable TV to only watch Game of Thrones?

1053
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,109
Scott: Well, if I can just pay that much for Game of Thrones only, then.

1054
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:01,651
Rym: Yep.

1055
00:50:01,972 --> 00:50:18,670
Rym: However, the problem is that these television networks still generate a ton of cash from these old people, so even if HBO knows 100% that's a dead business model and the future is the right way to go, they can't undermine that when it still brings in billions of dollars a year for nothing.

1056
00:50:19,713 --> 00:50:21,610
Scott: I don't think they unnecessarily undermine it, right?

1057
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:27,049
Rym: The argument is, and there's been some truth to this, that they would undermine it in a second.

1058
00:50:29,155 --> 00:50:29,770
Rym: Here's the example.

1059
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,749
Rym: That Viking show that I was talking about.

1060
00:50:32,251 --> 00:50:33,769
Rym: That show, I really like it.

1061
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:37,729
Rym: It's a drama that's pretty historically accurate about what Vikings were like.

1062
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:40,110
Rym: So I watched a bunch of it on the plane.

1063
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:40,770
Rym: It was really good.

1064
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,229
Rym: It was like watching a Burning Wheel game.

1065
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:44,209
Rym: It's Game of Thrones, but good.

1066
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:45,366
Rym: There, I said it.

1067
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:47,842
Rym: So I got home and was like, "Oh, I want to show Emily this.

1068
00:50:47,862 --> 00:50:48,307
Rym: I want to watch

1069
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:48,408
Rym: it.".

1070
00:50:48,691 --> 00:50:49,829
Rym: We go to the Vikings website.

1071
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:51,590
Rym: It's one of those shows.

1072
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:55,010
Rym: You can only watch it online, or you can't even buy it.

1073
00:50:55,110 --> 00:51:00,470
Rym: You can only watch it if you can prove that you pay for the History Channel on a provider.

1074
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,929
Scott: Or you can just go to the Pirate Bank and get it.

1075
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,589
Rym: Yeah, so I went to the Pirate Bank and got it.

1076
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,289
Rym: But ignore piracy for a second.

1077
00:51:06,393 --> 00:51:06,909
Rym: Think about this.

1078
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:12,810
Rym: The reason they do that is because the show is to drive people to keep paying for cable.

1079
00:51:13,232 --> 00:51:18,030
Rym: If people can get the five shows they like without paying for cable, they won't pay for cable anymore.

1080
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:20,670
Rym: They'll pay the five studios that make those five shows.

1081
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,370
Rym: Sure, that is true.

1082
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:23,590
Rym: And the entire cable network goes out.

1083
00:51:23,731 --> 00:51:25,010
Rym: That entire industry disappears.

1084
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,049
Scott: All right, so that's true.

1085
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:33,258
Scott: But the thing is, people who know how to get those shows on the internet like that are people who can pirate bay.

1086
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,309
Scott: They're smart enough already.

1087
00:51:39,552 --> 00:51:41,930
Scott: And those old people, they don't know how to do that.

1088
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,129
Scott: They're going to keep paying for cable.

1089
00:51:43,271 --> 00:51:52,550
Scott: So really, all you're doing is letting the people who, in the future, will have their way one funeral at a time, have their way now, and you still get all the old people money, right?

1090
00:51:52,773 --> 00:51:53,408
Rym: Well, that's just it.

1091
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,349
Rym: Because they'll still get the old people money.

1092
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,450
Scott: You're going to lose the old people money at the same time anyway.

1093
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:00,110
Scott: So all you're doing is making these people suffer.

1094
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:01,167
Scott: You're not going to, you know...

1095
00:52:01,392 --> 00:52:02,050
Rym: But that's what I'm saying.

1096
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,170
Rym: The reason all the streaming...

1097
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:04,810
Scott: People aren't paying for cable?

1098
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,589
Scott: They're using their parents' cable login, like me.

1099
00:52:07,115 --> 00:52:07,258
Rym: Yeah.

1100
00:52:07,278 --> 00:52:07,828
Rym: Well, it's funny.

1101
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:11,965
Rym: College Amber always says the thing where any time someone says, "I watched Game of

1102
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:12,369
Rym: Thrones."

1103
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:13,630
Rym: With my dad's HBO Go.

1104
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,368
Rym: Yes, it's always with my dad's HBO Go account.

1105
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,490
Rym: They say that every time.

1106
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:18,829
Rym: Actually, they always say "moms," I think.

1107
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:19,488
Rym: Alright, whatever.

1108
00:52:19,952 --> 00:52:20,650
Scott: Moms, dads, parents.

1109
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:24,370
Rym: But the reason every streaming service sucks is because of this.

1110
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:27,130
Rym: Because the money still comes from old people who don't know better.

1111
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:32,610
Rym: No one's figured out a way to make money in the new world, except for, like, Frederator and some of these small places.

1112
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:33,635
Rym: So...

1113
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,490
Scott: Yeah, make a show that has mad merch.

1114
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:36,430
Scott: Cat bug everywhere.

1115
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:37,430
Rym: Oh my god, cat bug.

1116
00:52:37,672 --> 00:52:38,389
Rym: Cat bug tattoos.

1117
00:52:40,215 --> 00:52:41,010
Scott: Cat bug everything.

1118
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,049
Rym: Let's look through the rest of these.

1119
00:52:43,217 --> 00:52:45,169
Scott: Oh, that was not really tech news.

1120
00:52:45,574 --> 00:52:46,010
Rym: No, not really.

1121
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,289
Scott: It was mostly TV news.

1122
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:52,270
Rym: Yeah, but it's sort of an explanation as to why some of the technology is stagnating.

1123
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:57,110
Rym: The technology stagnates because the money is in the old world for a while still.

1124
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:02,547
Rym: There's a study saying that the majority of malware is becoming what they call

1125
00:53:02,688 --> 00:53:03,110
Rym: "malvertising.".

1126
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:07,110
Scott: Well, that's been true for a long time, but this is mostly tech news.

1127
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,898
Rym: Apparently, that increased 200% in 2013 alone.

1128
00:53:11,251 --> 00:53:14,147
Scott: Whoa, so it was already most of it, and now it's even more.

1129
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:14,590
Scott: most of it?

1130
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:17,209
Rym: Yes, generating supposedly 12... But here's the thing.

1131
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,938
Rym: It's not the old world of.

1132
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:23,870
Rym: your computer gets malware, and then it shows you ads.

1133
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:28,510
Rym: Now, your computer gets malware and clicks on ads for other people.

1134
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:29,630
Scott: It's been doing that for a long time.

1135
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,150
Rym: 12.4 billion malicious ad impressions.

1136
00:53:33,072 --> 00:53:36,509
Rym: There are arguments that are possibly legitimate, I don't know.

1137
00:53:37,511 --> 00:53:43,109
Rym: It's possible that the majority of people who ever click on online ads either do it by accident or malware did it.

1138
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,049
Rym: When is online advertising going to collapse?

1139
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,790
Rym: When is this information going to hit the rest of the information?

1140
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:53,770
Scott: You know, sadly, probably after the TV collapses, but hopefully both of them within our lifetime.

1141
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,090
Scott: Is there things that I can see happening while we breathe?

1142
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:00,730
Rym: I mean, I'm amazed at how many people see ads on the internet to this day.

1143
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:02,677
Scott: Adblock Plus is actually like.

1144
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:05,070
Scott: the number of users is way bigger than you think.

1145
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:09,150
Rym: It is, but how come every time I ever use someone else's computer I see ads?

1146
00:54:10,571 --> 00:54:13,049
Rym: Except inside of our own very tight friend group.

1147
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:13,896
Scott: I don't know.

1148
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:16,143
Rym: Anyway.

1149
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,269
Scott: Yeah, but that's actually tech news.

1150
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:18,871
Rym: Yep.

1151
00:54:18,891 --> 00:54:31,410
Rym: Also, it kind of gives us an aside that for the few people, the minority of people who argue that ad blocking is somehow immoral, I say to you, is ad blocking not, in many cases, security?

1152
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,010
Rym: Because ads are the primary vector of malware.

1153
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:35,690
Scott: That's right.

1154
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:36,771
Rym: All right.

1155
00:54:37,113 --> 00:54:40,170
Rym: So there is a brouhaha about a smart gun seller.

1156
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:46,270
Rym: Someone designed a new sort of more modern version of the smart gun that only its owner can fire.

1157
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:49,730
Scott: So you buy a gun and you're the only one who can shoot it because you bought it?

1158
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,730
Rym: You are like people in your family.

1159
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,410
Scott: How do you demo it at the gun store?

1160
00:54:52,892 --> 00:54:57,270
Rym: Well, some of these, you set up biometrics like hand print or something like that.

1161
00:54:57,712 --> 00:54:57,848
Scott: Okay.

1162
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:02,110
Rym: Some of them, you have a special wristwatch that you wear when you want to go shooting.

1163
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,950
Rym: So say you're wearing- For someone to take your wristwatch.

1164
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:05,554
Rym: Oh, no.

1165
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:06,729
Rym: So say you're wearing it, right?

1166
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:06,899
Rym: Mm-hmm.

1167
00:55:07,232 --> 00:55:07,885
Rym: And you get mugged.

1168
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:11,450
Rym: You pull your gun out and you try to shoot the guy like you miss and he attacks you and grabs you.

1169
00:55:11,771 --> 00:55:14,226
Rym: He pulls the gun away from you and tries to shoot you with it.

1170
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,310
Scott: And then you can punch him in the face with no fear.

1171
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:16,870
Rym: Exactly.

1172
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:17,529
Scott: That's pretty good.

1173
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:18,968
Rym: He can't just shoot you with it.

1174
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:19,647
Scott: Pretty good.

1175
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:21,500
Rym: So it's cool technology.

1176
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,531
Rym: It might not be 100% there yet, but- Yeah.

1177
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:26,989
Scott: I mean, you try to punch him and while you're punching him, your arm goes near the gun and he shoots you.

1178
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:27,631
Rym: Yeah.

1179
00:55:27,651 --> 00:55:31,670
Rym: Well, the thing is, I'm pretty sure it's set up to where it has to be like right fucking there.

1180
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,670
Rym: It has to have been there for a little bit.

1181
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:34,655
Scott: Still, that's pretty good.

1182
00:55:34,675 --> 00:55:37,630
Scott: It's very unlikely the guy can get your watch right while you're-.

1183
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,493
Rym: It's a cool kind of technology because suppose- All right.

1184
00:55:40,513 --> 00:55:42,450
Scott: So the fact that this gun exists is definitely tech news.

1185
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:47,430
Rym: Well, I mean, it's not new technology, but the technology is getting better quickly and companies are starting to make them.

1186
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:50,204
Scott: And I wonder how that compares to laptops and iPhones.

1187
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:57,450
Rym: So say it's even as bad as an iPhone where it'll kind of work if you just rub anything dry enough.

1188
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,490
Scott: Is it biased towards yes or biased towards no?

1189
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:02,590
Rym: Even if it's biased toward yes- Either one has its problems, right?

1190
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,877
Rym: Even if it's biased toward?

1191
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:06,410
Rym: yes, think about a quick situation.

1192
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:18,870
Rym: If it's pretty much guaranteed to fire at your palm print, but maybe it'll only fire 10% of the time with someone else's palm print, in a heat of the moment someone grabs your gun, oh my God, those are pretty good odds.

1193
00:56:19,471 --> 00:56:19,833
Scott: Right.

1194
00:56:19,853 --> 00:56:28,990
Scott: I mean, the other thing is that if you're talking about making these- If you're talking about a situation, a quick situation, or a kid getting the gun out of the closet, this definitely solves the problem, right?

1195
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,099
Scott: Yes.

1196
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:35,070
Scott: But what it doesn't solve the problem of is let's say we made it so you could only manufacture this kind of gun, right?

1197
00:56:36,094 --> 00:56:38,670
Scott: And so it's very hard for any other kind of gun to get in the market.

1198
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,110
Scott: You think, aha, we'll stop the illegal gun problems.

1199
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,790
Scott: It's like, no, people will just take these and hotwire them, and then they have guns.

1200
00:56:45,371 --> 00:56:48,629
Scott: If they have time to sit there with the gun, they can dismantle the biometric part.

1201
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,390
Rym: Yes, but it's not to solve that problem.

1202
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:54,710
Rym: It's to solve the problem of Joey finds your gun and starts fucking with it.

1203
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:58,730
Scott: Yeah, and you don't need to put a stupid gun lock on it, which is much harder to remove.

1204
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,087
Scott: Whatever, so.

1205
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:05,530
Rym: So, a company may have had a new version of this, and they had some advertising, like check out our smart gun.

1206
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:11,288
Scott: I mean, if I was going to buy a handgun, for some reason that was legitimate, I would buy one of those.

1207
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:12,610
Rym: They received.

1208
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,778
Scott: Why not?

1209
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,230
Rym: A torrent of death.

1210
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,370
Scott: It probably looks all cool in technology.

1211
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:26,110
Rym: The company that made this product received a torrent of death threats, threats of violence, fake bombs being mailed to them, the likes of which the internet has never produced before.

1212
00:57:26,497 --> 00:57:26,749
Scott: Okay.

1213
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:34,010
Rym: The world, the sheer amount of violence that was threatened to these people by gun people.

1214
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:38,730
Scott: Oh, so wait, these people have guns and threaten someone, so we can lock them all up, right?

1215
00:57:38,953 --> 00:57:40,009
Rym: We probably should.

1216
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:40,669
Scott: Right, yeah.

1217
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:49,910
Scott: These are people who have a gun, like guns, and are threatening someone with death, so we can just go to all their houses and arrest them all, at gunpoint, and take all their guns.

1218
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:56,190
Rym: If you ever wonder why it's so hard to talk about technology in the world, look at this.

1219
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:00,608
Rym: This was not someone saying, "Hey, let's pass a law only allowing these kinds of

1220
00:58:00,629 --> 00:58:00,890
Rym: guns.".

1221
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:06,108
Rym: This was someone saying, "Hey, I invented a new technology that's incrementally better than existing

1222
00:58:06,148 --> 00:58:06,730
Rym: technology.".

1223
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:09,443
Rym: And the response was, "You should not go there.

1224
00:58:09,463 --> 00:58:10,508
Rym: You employ God death

1225
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:10,830
Rym: threats.".

1226
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:15,230
Scott: Well, actually, do you know the real reason, right, is there's a law in New Jersey.

1227
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:16,449
Rym: I know about that law.

1228
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:16,632
Rym: Oh.

1229
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:27,490
Rym: So the law in New Jersey says that if there is ever commercially available viable biometric control, then there's a time period wherein it has to be mandated.

1230
00:58:27,715 --> 00:58:27,865
Scott: Yep.

1231
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,109
Rym: Which, you know what, I'm also kind of far.

1232
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,909
Scott: What's wrong with that?

1233
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,530
Rym: As long as the technology is feasible.

1234
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:36,310
Scott: The lesser the law says, it has to be feasible, right?

1235
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:40,650
Rym: But the fact that there are gun owners who are against that, too, is, again, interesting.

1236
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:45,510
Scott: Right, but I mean, you know, listen, I have no problem with responsible gun ownership.

1237
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:53,029
Scott: Most of the people I know who own guns are responsible gun owners who use it for hunting and marksmanship and other perfectly legitimate uses, right?

1238
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:59,050
Scott: I don't know these, I mean, I'd never met in my life, actually, an irresponsible gun owner.

1239
00:58:59,354 --> 00:58:59,608
Scott: I have.

1240
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,830
Scott: Who's a crazy person who just wants to shoot people.

1241
00:59:02,132 --> 00:59:08,149
Scott: But clearly that person exists because they're sending death threats to this company and whoever is trying to sell these guns in New Jersey, whatever, right?

1242
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:14,110
Scott: And we just get rid of those people and then only the responsible gun owners will be left.

1243
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:14,810
Rym: Yeah, you know what, guys?

1244
00:59:15,191 --> 00:59:22,110
Rym: If those people did not have guns, I'd be pretty okay with really lax gun laws for the people who could still qualify for a gun.

1245
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:26,970
Scott: Well, I mean, it's really easy to find these crazy people because they really just expose themselves.

1246
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:27,524
Rym: Yeah.

1247
00:59:29,313 --> 00:59:31,450
Rym: Maybe this is a government honeypot to identify them all.

1248
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:33,489
Scott: The problem is if you try to go and arrest them, they shoot at you.

1249
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,609
Rym: Or they threaten to, and then you get the climate Bundy situation.

1250
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:42,790
Scott: Let's just stand in the front lawn and write down the crimes they're committing as they commit them.

1251
00:59:43,011 --> 00:59:43,909
Rym: You know, I've always wanted that.

1252
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:57,827
Rym: Maybe the way to draw the crazies out of the woodwork is to have Obama go on TV and be like, "So we're hereby making the city of Detroit a communist federal city under the jurisdiction of the federal government with guaranteed universal employment, and we're taking away everyone's

1253
00:59:57,847 --> 00:59:58,189
Rym: guns.".

1254
00:59:58,952 --> 01:00:04,130
Rym: And just everyone who goes apeshit and tries to attack government buildings, we just arrest them, and then that's the end.

1255
01:00:05,213 --> 01:00:06,425
Scott: We don't even do the thing in Detroit.

1256
01:00:06,445 --> 01:00:06,910
Scott: It was just a fib.

1257
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,439
Rym: Yeah, we don't do anything.

1258
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,990
Rym: We just say the things to evaporate.

1259
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:14,090
Scott: Just say things to get the crazies to come out of their hidey holes, and then we arrest all the crazies.

1260
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:18,470
Rym: It's the same way you can get ice to freeze faster if you evaporate the hottest ions and atoms.

1261
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:22,330
Rym: Well, not ions, but the hottest molecules out of the top.

1262
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:23,415
Rym: Do the same thing.

1263
01:00:23,435 --> 01:00:29,570
Rym: Evaporate the most crazy gun people out of the top, and suddenly I'm a lot less angry about gun control.

1264
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,990
Scott: Yeah, there's a lot, you know, we can just, they say the freaks come out at night, right?

1265
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:37,730
Scott: So we'll just bring the sun down, the freaks will come out, and be like, "All right, we got all you freaks.

1266
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:38,659
Scott: Into jail you go.

1267
01:00:38,984 --> 01:00:39,207
Scott: And we're

1268
01:00:39,227 --> 01:00:39,349
Scott: done.".

1269
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:40,410
Rym: Let's blow through the rest of these.

1270
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:41,366
Scott: There's more?

1271
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:42,612
Rym: Yeah, sad news.

1272
01:00:42,732 --> 01:00:50,770
Rym: Recently, Oklahoma botched an execution by using an untested drug because the drugs that they-- Because Europe stopped giving them real drugs.

1273
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:54,207
Rym: Yes, because Europe said, "Yo, you shouldn't execute people, you fucking

1274
01:00:54,247 --> 01:00:54,770
Rym: barbarians.".

1275
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:56,290
Scott: That's right, barbarians in Oklahoma.

1276
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,809
Rym: Here's why I think this is tech news.

1277
01:00:58,331 --> 01:01:06,989
Rym: The fact that the United States uses lethal injection of a cocktail of chemicals like this to this day is ridiculous, when we could-- This is not tech news at all.

1278
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:14,090
Rym: The technology exists to execute humans in a perfectly guaranteed-to-work, zero-pain--.

1279
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,090
Scott: But that's not technology news, that's technology olds.

1280
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:19,269
Rym: Yes, zero-distress method, and we won't implement it.

1281
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:22,550
Scott: Have I mentioned my zero-distress method on the show before?

1282
01:01:23,531 --> 01:01:25,870
Rym: The giant block that just crushes your entire head?

1283
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:26,649
Scott: Yeah, that method.

1284
01:01:27,672 --> 01:01:30,650
Rym: Or, you know what, nitrogen asphyxiation works just as well.

1285
01:01:31,933 --> 01:01:34,890
Scott: See, the reason I like my method is not because I'm a barbarian, right?

1286
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,970
Scott: I don't think we should kill anyone in the first place, right?

1287
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,890
Scott: But if you're going to, we've already decided that, right?

1288
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:41,790
Scott: For some reason we're stupid, we made the decision.

1289
01:01:42,372 --> 01:01:45,410
Scott: If you crush someone's head with a giant, giant rock, right?

1290
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:50,230
Scott: It's like a guillotine, but a really giant rock, and it doesn't cut your neck, it just smashes your head like a watermelon, right?

1291
01:01:51,014 --> 01:01:52,301
Scott: A, you don't feel shit.

1292
01:01:52,582 --> 01:01:53,970
Scott: You are just gone, right?

1293
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,789
Scott: So there's no suffering, it's really humane.

1294
01:01:56,290 --> 01:02:00,349
Scott: But B, the people who are so barbaric that they have to watch it-- Have to watch it.

1295
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:01,175
Scott: They have to watch it.

1296
01:02:01,195 --> 01:02:03,470
Scott: They don't just get to watch someone go to sleep, right?

1297
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:08,510
Scott: They gotta watch this head get smashed in, and then the people, the executioners, gotta clean that shit up.

1298
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:15,930
Scott: Or, I say, the people who are like, you know, the ones who asked for the death penalty in court, make them clean it up.

1299
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,359
Scott: It's like, alright, you want this person dead?

1300
01:02:17,802 --> 01:02:18,889
Scott: You do it and clean it up.

1301
01:02:20,151 --> 01:02:23,450
Rym: I worry that there's a bunch of people who would be like, hell's fucking yeah.

1302
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,563
Scott: Okay, then we know that they're crazy, we can lock them up too.

1303
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:27,569
Scott: They can go next.

1304
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:32,189
Rym: Alright, let's see, one more I think here is worth talking about.

1305
01:02:33,011 --> 01:02:36,190
Rym: So, Mayor de Blasio, New York City-- Best mayor so far.

1306
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:48,090
Scott: --has proposed yet more populist legislation-- Only politician that I did not complain about, have been a fan of, and has not done anything yet to prove any sort of scandal or corruption.

1307
01:02:48,251 --> 01:02:52,510
Rym: What's the over-under before the state and Cuomo tell him to go fuck himself on this one too?

1308
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,935
Scott: Well, but what's the over-under?

1309
01:02:53,975 --> 01:02:58,390
Scott: before he's found in bed with like ten dudes of-- No problem with that.

1310
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:02,430
Scott: Yeah, I had no problem with that either, but, you know, the world does, I guess, right?

1311
01:03:02,871 --> 01:03:03,393
Rym: Ah, you know what?

1312
01:03:03,835 --> 01:03:06,930
Rym: In New York, that probably wouldn't affect his reelection chances that much.

1313
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:07,910
Rym: As long as he didn't lie about it.

1314
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:08,429
Rym: It didn't help Weiner.

1315
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:12,210
Rym: If Anthony Weiner had been like, that's my dick on day one, I bet he'd still be in office.

1316
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,309
Scott: I guess Clinton got away with it.

1317
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:25,650
Rym: The moral is, these old people don't get it, if someone actually does have a picture of your dick, and they put it somewhere and say that's your dick, you have to say yes.

1318
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:26,546
Scott: Yeah.

1319
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,850
Rym: Unless you're actually not sure, because you might not-- Be like, hey, check out my dick.

1320
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:30,942
Rym: Yeah, be like, that might be my dick.

1321
01:03:31,003 --> 01:03:31,509
Rym: I'm not sure.

1322
01:03:33,252 --> 01:03:33,718
Scott: I don't know.

1323
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:34,629
Scott: It could be.

1324
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:36,219
Rym: So anyway, de Blasio-- Let's look.

1325
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:36,869
Scott: Pull your pants down.

1326
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:42,648
Rym: --is arguing that New York is special in the sense that we-- Yes, it is.

1327
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:47,929
Rym: --we need municipal Wi-Fi that's free for the entire city for the public.

1328
01:03:47,969 --> 01:03:48,150
Rym: good.

1329
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:48,692
Scott: Yeah.

1330
01:03:49,013 --> 01:03:52,730
Scott: We have that stupid Boingo Wi-Fi, which actually is pretty fast once you connect it to it.

1331
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:55,278
Scott: And it doesn't show-- it stopped showing me ads.

1332
01:03:55,338 --> 01:03:58,930
Scott: I think no one's paying for the ad spot right now, so you can just use it without watching the ad.

1333
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:04,670
Scott: But it's still annoying, because by the time you connect, by going to the website, like a hotel, the subway shows up.

1334
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:09,150
Scott: So I can only use it like late at night on the platform when I have to wait a while for the train to come.

1335
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:16,210
Rym: So he's basically forming a broadband task force to try to guarantee high-speed broadband to everyone in New York City--.

1336
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:22,830
Rym: --and to continue Bloomberg's initiative to turn every form of a phone in all of New York into a Wi-Fi hotspot that's free.

1337
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:23,490
Scott: Also good.

1338
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:29,170
Rym: Bloomberg is also pushing to give Harlem literally the largest contiguous free public Wi-Fi network in North America.

1339
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:30,329
Scott: Yeah, sounds good to me.

1340
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:30,871
Rym: Yep.

1341
01:04:31,214 --> 01:04:33,250
Rym: So the telecoms are lobbying against this, of course.

1342
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:34,093
Scott: Yeah, because you know what?

1343
01:04:34,595 --> 01:04:37,890
Scott: Goodbye phone plan, Wi-Fi only, Skype phone.

1344
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:43,830
Scott: And he seems to be going down the-- I'll buy temporary one-day SIM cards if I go to a convention or some shit.

1345
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:51,030
Rym: If Verizon and Time Warner don't play ball, he's talking about maybe bypassing them and doing it directly.

1346
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:51,889
Scott: Yeah, fuck 'em.

1347
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:59,869
Rym: Quote, "We're going to reexamine our franchise agreements, including with Verizon, Fios, and Time Warner Cable, to hold them accountable for providing the kind of servers they're obligated

1348
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:00,030
Rym: to.".

1349
01:05:00,171 --> 01:05:00,788
Scott: Yeah, fuck 'em.

1350
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:05,788
Rym: "I think the internet is a utility in cities and should be regulated as a

1351
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:06,270
Rym: utility.".

1352
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:08,050
Scott: I think the internet's a utility everywhere.

1353
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:15,070
Scott: Yes, but at least in New York City, getting the laws-- How are we supposed to be all ghost in the shell if we don't just have internet everywhere all the time?

1354
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:15,853
Rym: There are laws.

1355
01:05:15,914 --> 01:05:19,170
Rym: If you have an apartment building, you have to connect to the municipal water network.

1356
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:19,966
Scott: No.

1357
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,690
Rym: You're not allowed to just not do that.

1358
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:22,065
Rym: Really?

1359
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:25,630
Rym: The same thing should be for a municipal internet network.

1360
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:28,864
Scott: Yeah, they can run the internet cables right in the steam pipes.

1361
01:05:28,924 --> 01:05:30,010
Scott: Not that many people are buying steam.

1362
01:05:30,172 --> 01:05:31,509
Rym: A lot of people pay for steam.

1363
01:05:31,854 --> 01:05:32,510
Scott: Who's buying steam?

1364
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:35,710
Rym: Steam, because steam is way efficient if your building's hooked up for it.

1365
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:38,981
Scott: Listen, I know you can get a lot of video games on steam, right?

1366
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,770
Scott: It's a little old by now, right?

1367
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,839
Scott: And there's too many games coming out on there.

1368
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,509
Scott: It's like, "I stopped buying steam games a while

1369
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:45,690
Scott: ago.".

1370
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:46,313
Rym: No, imagine this.

1371
01:05:46,795 --> 01:05:51,596
Rym: Imagine a future where this happens, and New York City-- Forget the ISPs outside of New York.

1372
01:05:51,617 --> 01:05:54,990
Rym: Imagine if New York City laid some ridiculous fiber network.

1373
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:58,864
Rym: So within the city, we had tens of gigabits just everywhere.

1374
01:05:58,884 --> 01:05:59,567
Rym: Just infinite bandwidth.

1375
01:06:01,072 --> 01:06:03,158
Rym: Suddenly, there's things we can do in the city.

1376
01:06:03,178 --> 01:06:11,180
Rym: The city's network would be its own internet-- It would be an internet within the internet.

1377
01:06:12,103 --> 01:06:13,990
Rym: That's something that we haven't seen happen.

1378
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:24,230
Rym: What would happen within New York City if between your house, my house, and all our friends, and all the convention centers within the city, we had literally effective, infinite bandwidth?

1379
01:06:25,853 --> 01:06:29,190
Rym: I think a local internet of interesting shit would start happening.

1380
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:36,087
Scott: If they set it up, I don't think they'll set it up in that way to where we all have these local subnet of New York IPs.

1381
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:38,793
Rym: No, not like that.

1382
01:06:38,853 --> 01:06:44,515
Rym: But for example, imagine if there were just extremely high-speed links and high-speed trunks running around the city.

1383
01:06:44,555 --> 01:06:49,969
Rym: So if your packets are going to somewhere within New York City, you don't leave the municipal network.

1384
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:51,138
Scott: Oh, sure.

1385
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:51,749
Scott: Yeah, that's true.

1386
01:06:52,531 --> 01:06:53,800
Rym: Interesting things can happen.

1387
01:06:54,283 --> 01:06:58,608
Scott: We've never seen anyone-- To make really interesting things happen, you'd have to have this sort of New York--.

1388
01:06:59,131 --> 01:07:00,496
Scott: They are getting .nyc.

1389
01:07:00,656 --> 01:07:01,840
Scott: They've already got it, right?

1390
01:07:02,222 --> 01:07:10,070
Scott: So if they made .nyc internal, so if you went to a .nyc, it had to be a server hosted in NYC on the NYC network.

1391
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:15,008
Scott: Suddenly, now you can route to these internal NYC servers.

1392
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:16,817
Rym: Also, suddenly, imagine this.

1393
01:07:17,118 --> 01:07:19,590
Rym: You know the whole net neutrality debate about pairing and everything?

1394
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:23,161
Rym: Service providers, I think it would be perfectly okay.

1395
01:07:23,602 --> 01:07:29,390
Rym: if they wanted to, I think New York should let them just host in their network.

1396
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:32,581
Rym: Like, "All right, Netflix, you want to put a server in our network?

1397
01:07:32,983 --> 01:07:34,028
Rym: Infinite bandwidth, go

1398
01:07:34,048 --> 01:07:34,309
Rym: nuts.".

1399
01:07:34,852 --> 01:07:35,314
Scott: You know what?

1400
01:07:35,957 --> 01:07:38,350
Scott: You could do a lot of finance shit on the NYC network.

1401
01:07:39,334 --> 01:07:41,429
Scott: The stock market just plugs in and gets on there.

1402
01:07:42,854 --> 01:07:43,750
Rym: Interesting shit can happen.

1403
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:49,390
Rym: There's enough shit in NYC that NYC-- Two very smaller cities in piles of proof.

1404
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:59,290
Scott: If we made our own network and then connected it to the internet, we would be so strong enough to start bossing around other people and threaten to not peer with them.

1405
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:00,754
Rym: So imagine this.

1406
01:08:00,834 --> 01:08:03,910
Rym: Imagine if then Boston builds theirs and then we run a cable.

1407
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,940
Scott: Yeah, you own the cable between New York City and Boston.

1408
01:08:09,362 --> 01:08:13,100
Rym: No, the city of New York and the city of Boston agree to peer with each other.

1409
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:18,620
Scott: Okay, we'll just have to slow down any bandwidth when the Red Sox games are going on.

1410
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:23,120
Rym: Yeah, well, the cyber warfare division will handle that.

1411
01:08:25,183 --> 01:08:27,256
Scott: Oh, the Patriots are visiting Giants Stadium.

1412
01:08:27,296 --> 01:08:27,960
Scott: That's a shame.

1413
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,207
Rym: Oh, all the traffic lights turn red.

1414
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:32,718
Rym: I guess they can't make it to the game default.

1415
01:08:32,879 --> 01:08:33,160
Rym: Sorry.

1416
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,620
Scott: They got MITs, though, so it would be a tough fight.

1417
01:08:36,881 --> 01:08:37,359
Rym: Yeah, actually.

1418
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:38,078
Scott: We might lose.

1419
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:39,309
Rym: We'll have to enlist some help.

1420
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:40,219
Rym: We got RIT in the stadium.

1421
01:08:40,682 --> 01:08:41,506
Scott: We have graduates.

1422
01:08:41,527 --> 01:08:42,109
Scott: They have students.

1423
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:43,979
Scott: The students have a lot more free time on their hands.

1424
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:44,698
Rym: That is true.

1425
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:48,259
Scott: The graduates are, you know, sitting on the beach.

1426
01:08:49,801 --> 01:08:50,648
Rym: I think we're done here.

1427
01:08:50,828 --> 01:08:52,520
Rym: I think that's technology news.

1428
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:54,680
Scott: That was pretty tech news, but also politics news.

1429
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:58,359
Rym: Yeah, but technology and politics are too important to each other lately.

1430
01:09:05,272 --> 01:09:05,799
Rym: Time to watch hockey.

1431
01:09:19,662 --> 01:09:24,700
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1432
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,620
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

1433
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:32,380
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1434
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,895
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1435
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,200
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1436
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:43,319
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
