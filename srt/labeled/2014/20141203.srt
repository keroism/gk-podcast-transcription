00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,729
Rym: It's Wednesday, December 2nd, 2014.

2
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:10,910
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,043 --> 00:00:14,320
Rym: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,878
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight, the manga Prophecy by Tetsuo Ttsutsui.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,538
Scott: Prophecy is literally the title of the manga in English.

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,397
Rym: Let's do this!

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:44,719
Rym: A manga for which there is not a Wikipedia article yet, except on the French Wikipedia, and where there isn't even an Anime News Network encyclopedia entry on it, there's just a misspelled press release saying that Vertical picked it up.

8
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:45,676
Scott: Alrighty.

9
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:54,900
Rym: So yeah, in the news, you know, getting right into this, I did something as an anime fan, as someone who has been an anime fan for, my God.

10
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:57,120
Rym: So let's see, I was in fourth grade.

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,835
Rym: My God.

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,920
Rym: My God, is that an anime music video?

13
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:08,099
Rym: So I've been an anime fan since I was, so I was in fourth grade at five years old, so I was like nine.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,940
Rym: I was born in '82, 1991.

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,871
Rym: So since 1991, I've been a pretty hardcore anime fan.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,458
Scott: Does Voltron and Transformers count?

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,948
Rym: No, well, no, if you count that, I've been an anime fan since like 1985?

18
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:24,239
Scott: Six?

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,472
Scott: So I guess Akira showed in the US in '89, right?

20
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,879
Scott: But I obviously didn't see it then.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:46,460
Rym: I don't remember the year of that, I just know that when I was in fourth grade, I saw Vampire Hunter D, because my mom made me, and then I watched as much anime as I could get, and got hardcore into the VHS fan-subbing community long before RIT.

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:58,917
Rym: So in all that time, not only being a hardcore fan of anime, you know, the kind of person who goes to anime conventions, like doing a fucking podcast about anime, and a YouTube show about it.

23
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:04,199
Rym: Yeah, I never made an anime music video, until now.

24
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:07,119
Scott: Why did you suddenly make an anime music video?

25
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,159
Rym: Because my whole anime fandom, how many times have you or I said- You're gonna write a fanfiction next?

26
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:15,639
Rym: Actually, I promised someone I would now.

27
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:17,077
Rym: Okay, great.

28
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:21,180
Scott: Rym is devolving fandom back in time.

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,620
Rym: Yeah, someone hit me with the fan stone, so I'm evolving.

30
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,919
Scott: Yeah, I think he's gonna make some garage kits next.

31
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:34,180
Rym: So, in making an anime music video for the first time, because my whole life, I'd say like, "Oh, I should make an anime music video to that song.

32
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:34,835
Rym: That's an obvious

33
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:35,040
Rym: thing.".

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,859
Rym: And I just shit-talked and never did it, because it was hard to do shit with VHS whatevers.

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,440
Rym: And then in RIT, like, I could have made anime music videos, but didn't care enough to actually do it.

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,185
Rym: Like, what was the one you and I, we kept talking about?

37
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:49,320
Rym: doing the Chainsaw Juggler?

38
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:50,771
Scott: Yeah.

39
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:51,818
Scott: Do it now.

40
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,583
Rym: No.

41
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,380
Rym: Well, maybe, actually.

42
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,378
Scott: Whatever happened to that?

43
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:56,999
Scott: Chainsaw Juggler.

44
00:02:57,906 --> 00:02:58,900
Rym: He was a good friend of mine.

45
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,231
Scott: He was?

46
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:02,339
Scott: How did you make friends with a chainsaw juggler?

47
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:03,640
Rym: How did he die?

48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,099
Rym: That's the real question.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,939
Rym: With his arms bloody by his side.

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,563
Rym: What?

51
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,740
Rym: I just kicked him to death.

52
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:18,737
Rym: So, anyway, I already talked about this, but that new My Little Pony Equestria Girls thing, don't watch it.

53
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,680
Scott: It's not-- Rym watched it because he wanted to.

54
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,678
Rym: I didn't actually watch it.

55
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:29,359
Rym: So, like I did with the first one, I watched some YouTube clips to see what the deal was without actually watching the whole thing.

56
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:30,740
Rym: And it had better music.

57
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:39,320
Rym: And one of the songs triggered the anime music video since, as has been triggered many times in my life of, "Hey, that clock never rings.

58
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:40,436
Rym: That song is

59
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:40,640
Rym: perfect.".

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,079
Scott: Talk to me.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,899
Scott: Just tap your fingers right in the steering wheel.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,560
Rym: Oh, my God.

63
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:44,680
Scott: Spark in the eye.

64
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,460
Rym: Yeah, there's some motions that Ken Chiro makes sometimes, too, that fit that feeling.

65
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:54,519
Scott: So-- Turning around 180 degrees and standing still looking at someone right in the face.

66
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:58,113
Rym: So, there's that moment where you think, "Wow, that would make a really good anime music

67
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:58,416
Rym: video.".

68
00:03:59,022 --> 00:03:59,879
Rym: And then I thought, "You know what?

69
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:00,885
Rym: Fuck it.

70
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:03,053
Rym: I'm just gonna make it because how hard can it

71
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:03,174
Rym: be?".

72
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:04,918
Rym: And you know what the answer is?

73
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:06,460
Rym: Not fucking hard at all.

74
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,100
Rym: It is really easy to make a pretty good anime music video.

75
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:18,279
Rym: So, I sat down and not counting the time it took to download the 40-gigabyte Blu-ray-Rip of Utena, it took me about two days to make this thing.

76
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,899
Rym: I just threw it together, two days, in from here, bam, done, uploaded.

77
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:29,079
Rym: And I'm convinced that it's in, like, the top fifth of anime music videos ever made because most anime music videos really, really suck.

78
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:38,220
Rym: And, in fact, I went around watching a lot of anime music videos after I made it, like, recent ones, like, ones made in the last year, like, ones that didn't win tournaments.

79
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,403
Scott: Yeah.

80
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,700
Scott: You have tournaments of music videos?

81
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,425
Rym: Contests.

82
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:42,340
Rym: Tournaments.

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,006
Scott: Yeah.

84
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:43,719
Scott: Little bracket.

85
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,819
Rym: So, I learned some other things making this.

86
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:47,878
Rym: One, a lot of people really liked it.

87
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,258
Rym: I'm kind of surprised by that.

88
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:53,779
Rym: Two, animemusicvideos.org still exists.

89
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,525
Rym: Okay.

90
00:04:55,545 --> 00:05:03,580
Rym: That is still a place that is an active website, and it literally appears to be unchanged since 2003.

91
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,179
Scott: All right.

92
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:07,360
Rym: It seems to update every day with news.

93
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:08,954
Rym: It has its whole database.

94
00:05:08,994 --> 00:05:11,259
Rym: that also appears to be running the same back end.

95
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:13,199
Rym: And they have a FAQ.

96
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:16,300
Rym: The FAQ appears to be vintage 2003.

97
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,925
Rym: Okay.

98
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:21,660
Rym: It has, literally, the word "YouTube" does not appear anywhere on this website.

99
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,225
Rym: Wow.

100
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:26,060
Rym: And you still upload your anime music video to their website.

101
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,579
Scott: Where are they storing all these?

102
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,260
Rym: They're hosted locally.

103
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,320
Scott: They have enough storage and streaming power?

104
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,492
Rym: Well, their upload limit is 150 megabytes.

105
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,913
Scott: Oh, I see.

106
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:38,239
Scott: Okay.

107
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,660
Rym: Yeah, so you guys know, I rendered out the video to upload, like, this rough cut to YouTube, right?

108
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,920
Rym: The anime music video I made.

109
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,639
Scott: 10 ADPs?

110
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:52,353
Rym: Yeah, well, not actually 10 ADP, 'cause it's 4x3, but the equivalent of that for a 4x3.

111
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:53,346
Rym: Mm-hmm.

112
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:02,137
Rym: Yeah, following YouTube's recommended output settings for maximum quality for their transcoder, 4 gigs.

113
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:06,100
Rym: 4 gigs for a 2-minute-and-something video.

114
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,120
Rym: So the fact that animemusicvideos.org still exists is updated daily and seems to have a community.

115
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:22,900
Scott: It existed in the days before YouTube, it was the only way to get anime music videos, and in those days, your computer couldn't even play a 1080p video if such a thing existed.

116
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:25,480
Scott: It was pretty much 480i for everything.

117
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Rym: I remember the days, Scott... -And that was good quality.

118
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:37,400
Rym: ...of you, me, and James trolling that site, looking for anything worth showing to the RIT Anime Club, because we had shown every good anime music video in the world.

119
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,054
Scott: That we had access to that wasn't on just one VHS tape in some dude's closet.

120
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:41,379
Rym: Yep.

121
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:44,000
Rym: So the fag gets even better.

122
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,040
Rym: I found these how-to guides on how to make an anime music video.

123
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:47,603
Rym: Whoa.

124
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:52,760
Rym: A lot of talk about how to deal with, like, VHS artifacts or embedded subtitles.

125
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,989
Rym: Mm-hmm.

126
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:54,514
Scott: Cropping.

127
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:55,040
Scott: Yeah.

128
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,714
Rym: So I learned another thing, 'cause I figured, "Oh, I'll enter this anime music video in a bunch of anime music video contests or

129
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:01,218
Rym: tournaments.".

130
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,668
Rym: Mm.

131
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,539
Rym: I'm gonna call everything a tournament now.

132
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,560
Scott: Call tournaments contests.

133
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:14,520
Rym: Apparently, and it seems to be like a new thing for this year, KatsuKan, of all cons, has three separate anime music video death matches.

134
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,764
Scott: Death matches?

135
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,399
Rym: I'm gonna keep escalating this term.

136
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:17,928
Scott: Okay.

137
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:18,580
Rym: Contests.

138
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,933
Rym: They have the normal anime music video contest that every con has.

139
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:22,560
Rym: The Royal Rumble?

140
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,029
Rym: They have the, like, one-minute-or-less-submissions-only contest that is separate.

141
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,080
Scott: The Survivor Series?

142
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,635
Rym: That seems like an interesting thing.

143
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:31,060
Rym: Mm-hmm.

144
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,612
Rym: And then they have the NC-17 one.

145
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,346
Scott: The Animania?

146
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,060
Rym: The HMVs, I assume.

147
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:38,411
Scott: I almost --.

148
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:39,379
Scott: Or the PMVs.

149
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,120
Rym: Oh, well, it still has to be anime.

150
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,706
Rym: It's just NC-17.

151
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:42,848
Rym: Yeah.

152
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,015
Scott: So, PMVs.

153
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:45,259
Scott: Yeah.

154
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:50,660
Rym: So, I almost wonder, is that just, like, violent stuff?

155
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:54,760
Rym: Is it straight-up, like, just porn music videos?

156
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:55,062
Rym: Mm-hmm.

157
00:07:55,082 --> 00:08:02,330
Rym: And if it is hentai music videos, does anyone do one that's in the drama category and is super serious?

158
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,991
Scott: And the HMVs clearly aren't on YouTube.

159
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:05,859
Scott: 'cause you're not allowed to.

160
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:07,070
Scott: Where are they?

161
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,192
Scott: Yeah.

162
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:09,292
Rym: So, that opens --.

163
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:12,859
Scott: 'Cause, I mean, you know, you can find hentais on the Internet just by typing it in.

164
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:17,620
Scott: I've never searched or even thought to search for hentai music video.

165
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,199
Rym: I'm doing that on YouTube right now.

166
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,500
Scott: You're not gonna find anything on YouTube.

167
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,306
Scott: It's a hentai.

168
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:22,899
Rym: I've seen hentai on YouTube.

169
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,416
Scott: But it's gonna not be -- Is it 100% censored?

170
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,028
Rym: Hentai music video.

171
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:28,359
Rym: Here's a bunch of them.

172
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,975
Scott: Are they just censored?

173
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:30,339
Rym: That's a --.

174
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,619
Rym: That is a butt right there.

175
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,094
Scott: It's a butt with pants on.

176
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:34,700
Scott: Yeah.

177
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,020
Rym: Those -- Yes.

178
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,279
Rym: Those are, in fact, technically pants.

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,304
Rym: That's a --.

180
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:40,053
Rym: That's a --.

181
00:08:40,073 --> 00:08:40,600
Rym: That's not a dildo.

182
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,380
Rym: That's a reverse dildo.

183
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:43,264
Rym: Wow.

184
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:44,738
Rym: That's --.

185
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,880
Scott: So, they somehow created a video in such a way that you never see anything and such that it's okay to put on YouTube?

186
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,168
Rym: Uh, yeah.

187
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:56,000
Rym: This looks like it's skirting the very edge of the line.

188
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:58,844
Rym: So, yeah.

189
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:00,940
Rym: Anime music videos is still a thing.

190
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:06,099
Rym: And for anyone who thinks that they're hard to make, no, they're trivial to make.

191
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,540
Rym: It's really, really, really easy to make a good anime music video.

192
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Rym: If you think otherwise, I don't know, talent yourself up a little.

193
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,973
Scott: You also have Adobe Creative Cloud.

194
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:16,639
Scott: makes it way easier.

195
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,299
Rym: Yeah, own Premiere.

196
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,820
Rym: If you don't own Premiere, don't bother.

197
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,251
Scott: You don't own it.

198
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:20,860
Scott: You're just renting.

199
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,111
Rym: Yeah, no, I own it.

200
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:22,657
Rym: I pay for it.

201
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:22,960
Rym: It's mine.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,570
Rym: I can use it.

203
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:23,876
Rym: Yeah.

204
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,650
Rym: So, yeah, you got some news?

205
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:27,760
Scott: I do have some news.

206
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:40,880
Scott: So, one of the pleasures of living in New York City is, of course, seeing -- being able to go to screenings for things, right, that you cannot necessarily see anywhere else, especially including foreign or obscure things like animes.

207
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,014
Scott: But one thing in particular is gonna be screening in New York City on December 4th.

208
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,110
Scott: So, we got two days left.

209
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,380
Scott: Great.

210
00:09:52,460 --> 00:10:00,560
Scott: Which is a documentary called "The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness," which is a documentary about Studio Ghibli.

211
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,279
Scott: But I don't need to go to that screening, and neither do you.

212
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,900
Scott: Don't come rushing to the city for this because on December 9th, you can just download it digitally.

213
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:10,848
Rym: Oh, nice.

214
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:11,540
Rym: Yeah.

215
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,036
Scott: And it'll be on, like, video on demand on January 27th.

216
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,731
Scott: So if you wait, like, a month, you'll be able to see this thing really easily pretty much everywhere.

217
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:19,624
Scott: It's probably gonna -- Who knows?

218
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:20,800
Scott: It'll be on Netflix, everywhere.

219
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:21,303
Scott: Yep.

220
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:25,940
Scott: The only reason I will ever -- -And it's not -- You don't really need to see a documentary in the movie theater.

221
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,567
Rym: That's what I was saying.

222
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:34,477
Rym: The only reason I'll ever go to a theater is, one, if it's something you literally can't see elsewhere, like, when I saw that "Nothing Lasts Forever" movie -- -Well, you can't today.

223
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:34,600
Scott: Yeah.

224
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,520
Rym: But, like, that "Nothing Lasts Forever" movie -- -It was on YouTube for, like, a day a few months ago.

225
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,660
Rym: But there is a chance that -- Like, there are things that have been screened in theaters.

226
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:44,446
Rym: There's a chance.

227
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:45,979
Rym: there's literally no other way to see it.

228
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,399
Rym: Or, like, the director might be there.

229
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:56,240
Rym: Or it's a movie where you really need to see it in HD, crazy, IMAX, 3D, high frame rate, whatever.

230
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:58,600
Rym: But other things, yeah, don't need to see them in theaters.

231
00:10:58,721 --> 00:10:59,086
Rym: No.

232
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:00,160
Rym: Especially not a documentary.

233
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:08,679
Scott: Especially not for the amount of money that they charge, you know, having to go to the theater, having to deal with people, possibly sitting in front of me, possibly screaming kids.

234
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,159
Rym: So, I just want to point out -- -Possibly who knows what.

235
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:20,899
Rym: Unless I go to, like, the Children's Film Festival or, like, a special hipster screening of something, every time I go to the theater, the theater is basically completely empty, and it's just a private.

236
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,160
Scott: - -'Cause we're going to the good theaters.

237
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,839
Rym: Yeah, we are, meeting the theaters that are going out of business.

238
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,240
Scott: If there's a risk, you know, at a wrong theater, you could get into trouble.

239
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,399
Rym: If they open that Alamo-whatever Drafthouse-style theater in Manhattan -- -I think there is one.

240
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,915
Rym: The one that was going to open in Manhattan failed to open for reasons.

241
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:39,520
Rym: All right.

242
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,320
Rym: Otherwise, I would see every movie there.

243
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,204
Rym: Okay.

244
00:11:42,224 --> 00:11:45,300
Rym: So... There is one more other piece of news.

245
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:51,615
Rym: There is a deadline, a timeline for this, so if you care about this, follow the link that we link to now.

246
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:54,575
Rym: The deadline is December 5th.

247
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:55,483
Rym: Otakon.

248
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:56,257
Scott: That's really soon.

249
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:21,319
Rym: Otakon, the anime convention that we went to for a decade and presented panels at every year until they banned us from presenting panels at it, the one that, you know, all the drama and whatever, the one that refused to mail their badges and, as a result, has had the ridiculous, most awful line clusterfucks in anime convention history, has an official poll to determine whether or not they should mail the badges next year.

250
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,590
Scott: Why do they even need to ask?

251
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:23,700
Scott: Just fucking do it.

252
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,487
Scott: Jesus Christ.

253
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:24,791
Scott: So...

254
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,999
Rym: I'm linking to the forum post and the poll, the actual poll, but you have to give your legal name, your e-mail address, your member ID.

255
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:48,580
Rym: You have to have attended Otakon in the last three years, meaning they don't want feedback from all the people who quit going because they don't mail the badges because about three years ago is when the Thursday Night Line pickup went from manageable to fucked.

256
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:57,340
Rym: So, they also don't want anyone who doesn't ever go to Otakon because they don't mail the badges, like the people who can't go or it sucks to go because of that.

257
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:21,000
Scott: It's just an example of, right, this is the problem -- one of the core problems of nerd geek culture in general is when someone who provides geek services or geek things to the geek audience, right, will prioritize further servicing the existing audience as opposed to prioritizing growing the audience.

258
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,640
Rym: You, Captain, proposed this exact thing for selling PAX badges at the previous PAX.

259
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:28,984
Scott: Yeah.

260
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:30,400
Rym: So, are you a hypocrite?

261
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:32,909
Scott: There's a difference.

262
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:34,260
Rym: How is it different?

263
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:36,820
Rym: I'm not excusing Otakon here.

264
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,717
Scott: The audience for PAX is already larger than all PAXs combined.

265
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,040
Scott: Yeah.

266
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,020
Scott: Growing it serves no purpose.

267
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:46,040
Rym: Otakon's attendance actually dropped this year.

268
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:52,280
Scott: That's why they should concentrate on growing their audience and not on servicing the existing audience.

269
00:13:52,340 --> 00:14:01,820
Rym: I feel like they would be better -- one of the easiest ways they could grow their audience, aside from mailing the badges, which is obvious, would be to have fostered a culture of having good panel content.

270
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,840
Scott: This is an example of their bad culture, though.

271
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,806
Rym: Yeah.

272
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:08,120
Rym: Specifically, you must have attended Otakon within the last three years to participate.

273
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,540
Rym: Submissions that do not match our records will be discarded.

274
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,262
Scott: Sure.

275
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,640
Scott: I submit it anyway, dealing with it.

276
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:32,359
Rym: Yeah, however, if you go to Otakon's or care about Otakon, even if you haven't gone in the last three years, if you have a member ID, go fill this out now, because I suspect they have made this poll so that they'll have ammo to then not mail the badges, because that seems to be how they work.

277
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,720
Scott: Uh, yep, probably.

278
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:37,799
Scott: If they mailed the badges -- let's say they mailed them -- would you go?

279
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,403
Scott: Me?

280
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:41,900
Rym: No, I'd only go if I present -- I don't go to anime cons unless I'm a guest.

281
00:14:42,283 --> 00:14:43,379
Rym: That's just how it works.

282
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:51,169
Rym: I haven't attended an anime con where I wasn't a guest since Katsu-Con

283
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:56,022
Rym: 2004? 2004,

284
00:14:56,022 --> 00:14:56,304
Rym: I think.

285
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:58,540
Rym: Maybe 2005.

286
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,400
Rym: Pretty sure it was 2004.

287
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:00,928
Scott: So, who cares?

288
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:11,916
Scott: Yeah, so if they invite us back as guests -- -But, I mean, that same phenomena of servicing your existing fans as opposed to growing your fandom can be seen in comic books.

289
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:12,359
Scott: Yep.

290
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,459
Scott: It can be -- You know, this is the sort of thing, right, that the Gomer Gates comes out of.

291
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:34,620
Rym: Imagine if DC and Marvel had a joint poll where you could vote on whether or not the boobs were excessive in their recent comics, but in order to vote, you have to give them the back pages of three issues from the last year to prove that you're actually a reader.

292
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,204
Rym: Yep.

293
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,700
Scott: It's like, "Great.

294
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,071
Scott: Let's ask the people who read the titty comics if they want more titty comics,".

295
00:15:40,112 --> 00:15:41,119
Scott: you know?

296
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,620
Scott: But, I mean, you know, the Gomer Gates is the same deal.

297
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:53,340
Scott: It's like, "Hey, you know, you video game companies, you keep making the games that we insular group of bros want," you know?

298
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,580
Scott: And it's like, "Don't make games for anyone else but us, bros.

299
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,859
Scott: Stop growing your audience.

300
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,105
Scott: Just service us.

301
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:01,979
Scott: Service our niche only," you know?

302
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:03,360
Scott: "Oh, my God, animes.

303
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:10,327
Scott: Why do you keep making moe shows that only otakas want to watch instead of making animes that everyone wants to watch, like Ghost in the Shell?

304
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,133
Scott: Why?".

305
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:11,355
Scott: Yeah.

306
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,540
Scott: This is the same problem.

307
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,840
Scott: You can find it everywhere in all geekeries.

308
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,500
Scott: You can even find it in, like, fucking car companies.

309
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,120
Scott: "Hey, car company, make a car that, you know, with a manual transmission that us car people really want to drive.

310
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,991
Scott: No, don't make a Toyota Camry.

311
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:28,232
Scott: No.".

312
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:37,501
Rym: [ Laughs ].

313
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:39,993
Rym: So, things of the day.

314
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:41,300
Rym: I'm gonna cop out.

315
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,448
Rym: I'm making my anime music video my thing of the day because my anime is --.

316
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:46,249
Scott: You can't make your own thing a thing of the day.

317
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:47,100
Rym: Totally fucking can.

318
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,769
Scott: That's metamoment.

319
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:48,600
Scott: It's not thing of the day.

320
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,607
Rym: That's the thing of the day.

321
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:50,474
Rym: Wow.

322
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:51,160
Scott: You failed.

323
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:51,604
Rym: Yeah.

324
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:52,540
Scott: That was the worst.

325
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:55,980
Scott: Without -- I don't even need to look at the history.

326
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,480
Scott: Worse thing -- Even worse than the time you had no thing of the day, and I had two just last week or whatever is your worst thing of the day ever.

327
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:02,824
Scott: You know what?

328
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:04,931
Scott: Regardless of the quality of your music video --.

329
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:06,306
Rym: What is the rule of the things of the day?

330
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,647
Scott: You move something from metamoment to thing of the day.

331
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,060
Rym: But, Scott, did --.

332
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,087
Scott: That is the ultimate fail.

333
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:12,839
Rym: Did I make this for GeekNights?

334
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:13,849
Rym: Is it a geek?

335
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,193
Rym: - No.

336
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:14,517
Rym: It's mine.

337
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,750
Scott: It doesn't matter.

338
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,500
Rym: It's not GeekNights.

339
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:17,232
Rym: It's just me.

340
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:17,720
Rym: It's Rym.

341
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,526
Scott: Doesn't matter.

342
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:19,819
Scott: All right, fine.

343
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:21,780
Rym: So, here's an alternate thing of the day.

344
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:23,173
Scott: A real thing of the day.

345
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:23,819
Rym: Your little baby.

346
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:34,299
Rym: Here is how to cook shrimps in three seconds with a shrimp gun, a butter gun, a tempera, like, flake gun, and a fire gun.

347
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:35,949
Scott: Would you eat that shrimp?

348
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:37,360
Rym: Yes, because I've eaten raw shrimp.

349
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:38,560
Rym: So I would totally eat this shrimp.

350
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,639
Scott: No, but, I mean, it's not -- I mean, you're willing to eat it, but, like, do you want to eat it?

351
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,117
Rym: Kind of.

352
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,220
Scott: I would prefer to eat a properly prepared shrimp.

353
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,020
Rym: I think that there is a market for restaurants that prepare food in this manner.

354
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,200
Scott: Yes, it is a spectacle.

355
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,197
Scott: You will pay to see it.

356
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,880
Scott: Just like I was at Stu Leonard's over the weekend.

357
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,780
Scott: They had a thing that was, like, popping out tortillas, like, pop, pop, this weird, cool machine to make you go, "Ooh," and be interested.

358
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:07,620
Scott: But those tortillas didn't taste any different from any other one.

359
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,793
Rym: So, I would eat these shrimps.

360
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:10,540
Rym: It's a really cool video.

361
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,850
Scott: It's a good video.

362
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:12,938
Scott: Much better video than food.

363
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,460
Scott: So, I got a very good thing of the day that is very simple and Zen-like.

364
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:21,920
Scott: It is just a tweet with a photo in it.

365
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,358
Scott: Really, the photo is the thing of the day.

366
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:27,720
Scott: It's some baby stingrays, one of the best animals that exist on Earth.

367
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:28,488
Rym: Pretty good.

368
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:29,460
Scott: Definitely better than human.

369
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,639
Scott: Yeah, baby stingray.

370
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,980
Scott: You ever wonder what they look like when they're tiny?

371
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:36,940
Scott: They're even tinier than Mantic, the Pokémon.

372
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,445
Rym: You know what?

373
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:38,420
Scott: That's a stingray Pokémon.

374
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:41,340
Rym: It's actually way more adorable than you're imagining.

375
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,500
Scott: Is there a difference between a stingray and a manta?

376
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:45,818
Scott: Or are they just different kinds of the same thing?

377
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,888
Rym: Like, there's Calrays.

378
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:47,980
Rym: There's a bunch of different kinds of rays.

379
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,799
Scott: Are they all rays?

380
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,640
Rym: I don't know the full nomenclature.

381
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,528
Rym: Manta.

382
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:54,520
Scott: I think they're all rays.

383
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,401
Rym: Ray.

384
00:18:55,461 --> 00:19:00,240
Rym: Yeah, but what level of binomial nomenclature is the ray?

385
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,061
Scott: Yep.

386
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:03,698
Scott: And where did the word "ray" come from?

387
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:04,923
Rym: Ayanami.

388
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,280
Scott: This is a different kind of ray.

389
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:12,960
Rym: So, in the meta moment, some guy named Rin made an anime music video, but that's the thing of the day.

390
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,960
Scott: That's a perfectly fine meta moment.

391
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,058
Rym: It's not a meta thing about GeekNights, so we can't talk about it here.

392
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,899
Rym: Hopefully, we're gonna be at PAX South coming up in a couple months.

393
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,979
Rym: Kinetica and panel submissions are secretly open, but we're not publicizing it super much yet, but you can go ahead and submit.

394
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:32,540
Rym: Probably be making more official announcements about it in the near future.

395
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:35,199
Rym: We're probably gonna be at PAX East.

396
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,760
Rym: Probably gonna be in Anime Boston.

397
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:48,320
Rym: We have a bunch of shit on the internet, and I've started uploading a bunch of stuff, and I will have many more videos soon, from my appearance at PAX Australia.

398
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:50,840
Rym: I uploaded a very short bit.

399
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,480
Rym: That's just me talking about Shadowgate.

400
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:52,964
Rym: Death.

401
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:53,107
Rym: Death.

402
00:19:55,603 --> 00:20:04,860
Rym: And I have a little bit I'm gonna upload later about Gone Home and how it's not a game and how actually it is a game and the people who say it's not a game are assholes.

403
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,920
Scott: Well, it's definitely not an orthogame.

404
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,585
Rym: You know what it is?

405
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,100
Rym: It's an interactive amusement.

406
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,450
Rym: It's entertainment software.

407
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,580
Rym: It is entertainment software.

408
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:12,863
Scott: Yep.

409
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:13,698
Scott: That is what it is.

410
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,179
Rym: I have this whole bit where I'm like...

411
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,526
Scott: You know what?

412
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:19,000
Scott: It doesn't really... People just get hung up on the no true Scotsman.

413
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,859
Scott: Like, you say something's not a game, and they act like you're anti-Scotsmanning.

414
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,640
Scott: it when it's like the category of a thing has no bearing on the quality of the thing.

415
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,300
Rym: Yep, but simultaneously... -You can say tic-tac-toe.

416
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:31,807
Scott: You know what?

417
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:32,759
Scott: Tic-tac-toe is a game.

418
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:34,419
Scott: That doesn't make it fucking good.

419
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,507
Scott: It's still garbage.

420
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,860
Scott: Gone Home, not a game.

421
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:38,419
Scott: Still really good.

422
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,254
Rym: Simultaneously, a lot of people get really mad when...

423
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,320
Scott: Marching band, not a sport.

424
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,199
Rym: People say things are not a game because actually they just don't like that thing.

425
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:48,944
Scott: Right.

426
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:52,380
Scott: The same way that you... Most people are making the fallacy of no true Scotsman.

427
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:58,859
Scott: I'm not making that fallacy, but I am assumed to be making it because I'm saying the same exact words that some moron says.

428
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:01,179
Rym: Except it is a game, because "petty cake" is a game.

429
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,174
Scott: By one definition?

430
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:03,518
Scott: Yes.

431
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,079
Rym: By basically all non-Grognard definitions, "petty cake" is a game.

432
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,699
Rym: But anyway, you can watch these videos to see what the fuck we're on about right now.

433
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,160
Rym: The book is Watership Down.

434
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:15,431
Rym: It was delightful.

435
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:16,039
Rym: I read it.

436
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:17,599
Rym: I can't believe I'd read this book sooner.

437
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:18,818
Rym: You should all read it.

438
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:20,299
Rym: Scott probably hasn't started it yet.

439
00:21:20,682 --> 00:21:23,440
Rym: I've moved on to reading a couple other books while I wait for him to finish it.

440
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:23,798
Scott: Like what?

441
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,110
Rym: Bunch of novels.

442
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,939
Rym: Which one?

443
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:36,340
Rym: So right now, I'm actually reading a long essay on basically the Bhopal industrial disaster.

444
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,740
Scott: So not a bunch of novels.

445
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,019
Rym: Yeah, I got novels queued up.

446
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:41,640
Rym: So you just lied.

447
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,367
Rym: No, I got novels queued up, too, -but this essay is really fascinating.

448
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,699
Scott: Yeah, you know how many novels I got queued up?

449
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:46,259
Rym: Yeah?

450
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:51,560
Scott: Actually, I just bought a bunch of really bad... Well, I assume really bad novels.

451
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:52,700
Rym: Oh, great.

452
00:21:53,344 --> 00:21:55,137
Scott: There was a mega sale going on.

453
00:21:55,741 --> 00:22:03,800
Scott: So for like almost no money, I bought all the novels that are related to the Android/Netrunner/Infiltration universe.

454
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,020
Scott: So you're reading Android slash?

455
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,299
Scott: No, I didn't read any of them.

456
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:07,831
Scott: And they're not fan fiction.

457
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:10,779
Scott: They're official fiction.

458
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:13,780
Scott: But I haven't read even one page of those either.

459
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,279
Scott: I'm not going to anytime soon, but I got them.

460
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,020
Scott: So I can wield them as deadly weapons.

461
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:25,120
Rym: And of course, look at all our shit on forums and YouTubes and everything.

462
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:29,960
Rym: Our forum has been really rocking lately, and you should go poke around in there.

463
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,080
Scott: The forum cost me a lot of money.

464
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,720
Rym: There's also a funny thing.

465
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,157
Rym: A Gomer Gator came in and was like, "I'm trying to actually argue on behalf of Gomer Gate, because I'm not...".

466
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:45,434
Rym: But then... And a bunch of people, like I got some PMs from people and like, "Oh, we really want to argue and be earnest,

467
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:45,777
Rym: whatever.".

468
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:54,080
Rym: And then our good friend Andrew posted in the forum a link to a Gomer Gate web page where they basically like infiltrate forums and do this thing.

469
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:54,893
Rym: And it was like, "Wow,

470
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:55,218
Rym: really?".

471
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,899
Rym: And then suddenly all those people stop posting.

472
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,319
Rym: Yeah, Gomer Gate's dumb.

473
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,780
Rym: I only say this now in the meta moment, because three people got really mad when I made fun of Gomer Gate via an Utena video.

474
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,340
Rym: And I couldn't believe that there were people who were fans of us, like legit fans.

475
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:15,359
Rym: I know that.

476
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,060
Rym: I mean, they subscribe to me on YouTube.

477
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,660
Rym: They watch like all our stuff that comes out on YouTube.

478
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:23,180
Rym: I guess they've never actually listened to our show.

479
00:23:23,642 --> 00:23:27,899
Rym: And they definitely didn't follow me on Twitter or else they would have known that I didn't respect them.

480
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:32,180
Rym: And they rage quit GeekNights, as far as I can tell.

481
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,400
Rym: And I feel like that was a good thing.

482
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:38,500
Scott: So if there's any Gomer Gate people out there now, please rage quit GeekNights.

483
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,237
Scott: We don't want you.

484
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,020
Scott: I just wanted to make it clear.

485
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,780
Scott: Even better, prove to us that you are worthy, you are a respectful, quality human being and change your ways.

486
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,479
Rym: And if not, well, good day, sir.

487
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:51,460
Scott: Get the fuck out of here.

488
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,680
Scott: I got time for your bullshit.

489
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:54,940
Rym: So Scott handed me this manga.

490
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:56,718
Scott: So here's the deal.

491
00:23:57,221 --> 00:24:01,740
Scott: The vertical, which is a seems to only publish amazing mangas in the United States.

492
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:05,200
Scott: Yeah, they've pretty much never published anything bad ever.

493
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,880
Scott: As far as I can tell, they had a manga coming out called Prophecy.

494
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:19,800
Scott: And I ordered volume one, probably based on the fact that they are publishing it, the low price and the cover and the description that I don't remember because that's all I had to go on in my preorder.

495
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:26,240
Scott: And then, of course, it sat in the pile of unread comics, as did every other comic that I bought recently.

496
00:24:27,182 --> 00:24:34,980
Scott: And then I had to fill out the comic order form because, you know, even though I'm not reading comics still buying them by a lot less than I bought before.

497
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,493
Scott: I'm buying like less than $50 worth.

498
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:39,380
Scott: I used to buy like a hundred and fifty dollars.

499
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,599
Rym: I'm not playing games, but I'm still buying them.

500
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,200
Scott: Exactly.

501
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,240
Scott: I'm going to read them soon.

502
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:46,740
Scott: I'm getting into comics reading mood, especially with the cold darkness.

503
00:24:48,142 --> 00:24:52,000
Scott: So I'm going through the comic order form and I see Prophecy two and it seems interesting.

504
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,240
Scott: And I'm like, what's that about?

505
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:56,440
Scott: And then I'm like, wait, did I order Prophecy one?

506
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:57,218
Scott: And yes, I did.

507
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:57,592
Rym: Wow.

508
00:24:57,901 --> 00:25:06,400
Rym: I feel very vindicated now for the fact that more than once I've gone to steam said, oh, that game's on sale, tried to buy it and find out that I already seen that as a better job of telling you what you've already bought.

509
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,633
Rym: Yes, probably because people keep trying to buy things.

510
00:25:08,753 --> 00:25:14,720
Scott: because so I'm like, I need to know whether or not I should buy Prophecy to let me go read Prophecy one.

511
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,960
Scott: So I went through the pile and found Prophecy one and my long lost lanyard.

512
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:19,739
Rym: Did you buy Prophecy two?

513
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:24,180
Scott: And I read Prophecy one to figure out if I should buy Prophecy two.

514
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,720
Rym: So did you buy Prophecy to that?

515
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,039
Rym: That'll tell us the most about the review that we're about to give.

516
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:30,258
Scott: Yeah, pre-order Prophecy two.

517
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:36,140
Rym: OK, I was hoping you did because otherwise I you'd be going to some cancellations.

518
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,860
Rym: So I don't know anything about the Magica.

519
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:44,780
Scott: I knew nothing about this whatsoever other than the description in the cover and the name and the publisher.

520
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:45,520
Rym: Yep.

521
00:25:45,921 --> 00:26:01,100
Rym: So pretty much what it's about is what if a 4chan type decided to become a terrorist and simultaneously listen to all those episodes on GeekNights about how to effectively be an evil person.

522
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:04,860
Scott: Yeah, it's sort of like this weird combination.

523
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:12,959
Scott: You've sort of got the police action of ghosts in the shell, like procedural police drama, but the police aren't strictly the good guys.

524
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,220
Rym: But the protagonist is definitely not a good guy either.

525
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,179
Scott: No, there aren't a lot of good guys here at all.

526
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,152
Rym: You know, there's one good guy that the one photographer with the funny face who's just like, she's a pretty lady.

527
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,099
Scott: That's not a good guy.

528
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:27,372
Rym: Keep saying it, though.

529
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:28,019
Rym: That's the best guy.

530
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,820
Scott: So the obvious pit boy is yes.

531
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,899
Rym: Well, I saw the mascot of the Internet Cafe.

532
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,047
Rym: Is that Pip-Boy?

533
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:36,599
Rym: And then two pages later, yep.

534
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:41,956
Scott: Well, no, there's another obvious good guy, the foreign guy who worked at the Pip-Boy and died.

535
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:46,040
Rym: Well, good guy or just tragic guy.

536
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,418
Scott: But I mean, he's not a bad guy.

537
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,606
Scott: There is nothing bad about that guy.

538
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,019
Scott: Every other character, there's something bad about them.

539
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,118
Rym: Yeah, that is true.

540
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:54,962
Scott: Right.

541
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:55,880
Scott: Even the punk.

542
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:02,800
Scott: It's like it opens up introducing like the police characters by having them solve, you know, sort of like this other unrelated crime to the main story.

543
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,280
Scott: They set it up as many, many, many police things do.

544
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:06,620
Scott: Right.

545
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,780
Scott: Batman catches some like just random thugs before the rest of the Joker plot is introduced.

546
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:12,144
Scott: Right.

547
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:13,379
Scott: It's sort of that kind of deal.

548
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:18,300
Scott: But the guy that these police catch right away, some punk kid who is pirating video games.

549
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,866
Scott: And on the one hand, you start off, of course, you know, being someone sympathizing with the kid, pirating the video games, thinking the police are bad.

550
00:27:27,027 --> 00:27:29,020
Rym: But then the kid is like Super 4chan.

551
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:31,060
Scott: Yeah, the kid is a super piece of shit.

552
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,040
Scott: So you're sort of like, wow, bad cops arresting bad kid.

553
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,306
Scott: I don't really care.

554
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:41,099
Rym: But then the cops, like especially the lady cop, they go above and beyond being dicks.

555
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:47,111
Rym: Yes, like she is a super ultra dick, but the kids sort of deserves it.

556
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:48,340
Rym: But well, the kids a little shit.

557
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,515
Rym: So it's like a little shit, right?

558
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,180
Scott: The crime.

559
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:57,600
Scott: It's like, I don't think, you know, obviously stands on piracy are the problem of the reason that you feel conflicted about this.

560
00:27:57,923 --> 00:28:01,639
Scott: If the kid had committed some other crime, like shoplifting, you'd be like, fuck that kid up.

561
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:02,565
Rym: But that was.

562
00:28:02,586 --> 00:28:04,340
Rym: what's interesting is almost right away.

563
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:08,120
Rym: Like you see a picture of an R4 cartridge and I'm like, wait a minute.

564
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:09,267
Rym: That's a real thing.

565
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,160
Rym: And then they start talking about it.

566
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:19,640
Rym: And then I realized that this is taking a reasonably, in fact, a surprisingly reasonably realistic approach to the things it's doing.

567
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:27,120
Scott: Yeah, everything that happens in this manga is like 100% modern day technology realism.

568
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,072
Scott: There's nothing supernatural.

569
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:30,500
Scott: or how do you pull off his crime?

570
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:38,639
Rym: Like not a super spoiler, like a guy basically is uploading videos via a tunnel from one net and one net cafe to another net cafe.

571
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,700
Rym: And there's a big thing like, how do you break our encryption?

572
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,410
Rym: We've got a one time pad system.

573
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,899
Rym: We've got like that RSA dongle.

574
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,500
Scott: And by some convoluted way that's revealed, he got one of those dongles.

575
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,608
Rym: He's just got one of the dongles.

576
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:50,879
Rym: That's that's how that works.

577
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,600
Scott: Yeah, like he didn't crack some ridiculous encryption with God hacking powers.

578
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:57,759
Rym: Yup, that's how you break those things.

579
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:12,039
Rym: And what's interesting is that there's no other than the person who, the person in the past, that poor immigrant guy, who is sort of the genesis of the rest of this.

580
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:15,120
Rym: No one is really a sympathetic character.

581
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,080
Rym: The guy doing the terror is kind of a vengeful piece of shit.

582
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,260
Scott: Yeah, no, he's definitely, it's just vigilante justice.

583
00:29:22,481 --> 00:29:26,060
Scott: And some of the justices he's fighting for are clearly injustices.

584
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,617
Rym: But some of them are like, so you're like you're feeling good.

585
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:37,000
Scott: on the one hand that like, yeah, justice is being served on to people that otherwise would not have justice served on to them that deserve it.

586
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,060
Rym: Like he goes after a guy.

587
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,060
Scott: He's dispensing justice that is far more harsh than it should be.

588
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,059
Rym: Like on one hand, he goes over the, you know, the sexual predator guy.

589
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:46,499
Rym: Yup.

590
00:29:46,782 --> 00:29:47,559
Rym: And like, you know what?

591
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:50,360
Rym: Not super broken up about what happened to that guy.

592
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:56,100
Scott: No, I mean, not anymore broken up than you'd be about, you know, Batman beating the shit out of people who are just stealing some jewelry.

593
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,240
Rym: But then he had, but then he basically beats the guy mostly to death with a baseball bat.

594
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,080
Rym: And as far as I can tell, was that the guy who was just mean to a nerd at his job?

595
00:30:05,362 --> 00:30:06,219
Scott: Yeah, something like that.

596
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:06,508
Scott: Yeah.

597
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:06,955
Scott: Yeah.

598
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:19,820
Rym: And there's definitely this undercurrent of like, it seems to be that the story is going in the direction of this guy committing these crimes, basically causes this sort of second order simulator goes to the shell kind of thing.

599
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:24,940
Rym: But it's among 4chan or gamer gator pieces of shit.

600
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:34,660
Rym: Like they're the people, the downtrodden, awkward, that guys are the ones who are rising up and they're using 4chan technology to commit acts of terror.

601
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:36,159
Scott: And the cops are going after him.

602
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,320
Scott: So you're sort of like, go cops, but the cops are pieces of shit.

603
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,280
Scott: Like the kind of like Ferguson kind of cops.

604
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:41,617
Scott: Yeah.

605
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,302
Scott: So you're not.

606
00:30:45,983 --> 00:30:48,100
Scott: And it's sort of fascinating to watch the shit go down.

607
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,840
Rym: I kind of like the aspect that I'm not rooting for anyone at all in this.

608
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,880
Rym: So I'm just reading it like, well, let's just see where this goes.

609
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,700
Scott: It's like you're rooting.

610
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,809
Scott: It's like the character that is the good guy.

611
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,100
Scott: is society, right?

612
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:07,320
Scott: And you're seeing like the dregs, the dregs of society, like all the bad parts just like set each other on fire.

613
00:31:07,423 --> 00:31:11,679
Scott: And you're like, God, I hope all these people dies at the rest of society can be clean of them.

614
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:27,120
Rym: But in one way, I'm glad that this it's taking a surprisingly nuanced approach because if you could easily make the story be the smart internet kid is able to right social wrongs and change the world because old people can't keep up technology technology all that stuff.

615
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:38,499
Rym: But at the same time the kinds of people like say you and me who could easily do those sorts of things aren't amoral and evil like light Oh types now.

616
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:46,239
Rym: And on the other hand the cops they could be the good guys, but in the real world cops often aren't the good guys.

617
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,820
Scott: Yeah, good thing your product Death Note, right?

618
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:59,200
Scott: So, you know, there is a Death Note aspect to this of the cops procedurally trying to find, you know, the bad guys and you know, they're really actually quite clever these cops.

619
00:31:59,442 --> 00:32:04,040
Scott: Yeah, but you know, as opposed to like L is a hundred percent good guy.

620
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,917
Scott: You just a little weird, right?

621
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,755
Scott: That's it.

622
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,679
Scott: That's the key difference here, right?

623
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:16,740
Scott: You also the be you know, the bad the terrorist guys are not doing, you know, they're not sort of like having this battle of minds with each other.

624
00:32:17,222 --> 00:32:22,520
Scott: He's just sort of using his method that he's always used and continuing to use it and not changing anything about his method.

625
00:32:22,581 --> 00:32:24,480
Rym: and he's also not by any stretch of genius.

626
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:32,200
Rym: He's like there's a great scene where the these other kind of uneducated people he's talking to or like, oh my God, that's crazy math.

627
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,380
Rym: You're doing what are you a genius?

628
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,246
Rym: And he's like guys.

629
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:35,999
Rym: that's like 11th grade math.

630
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:40,000
Scott: Yeah, it's not like some uber hacker.

631
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:47,360
Rym: It's just a person who knows how to use computers, but at the same time a person who knows how to use computers is by the standards of modern society and uber hacker.

632
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:47,920
Scott: Sure.

633
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,260
Rym: I mean the things that the hacking is really realistic.

634
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,859
Rym: That's like this kid.

635
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,980
Rym: However, it's not neo.

636
00:32:54,861 --> 00:33:04,138
Rym: Yes, but at the same time like he's not he's making the kinds of mistakes that like if Scott or I were doing a similar thing, we would not have made like the camera thing.

637
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:12,264
Scott: I mean, you know, it's it's cool to just see something that's, you know, so tied to the real world in the present that I'm also

638
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,169
Rym: very topical

639
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:26,177
Scott: topic that you can relate to a lot, but at the same time has so many, you know, standard plots of high quality animes that we like otherwise, like Ghost in the Shell Death Note Etc.

640
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:27,379
Scott: All tied together.

641
00:33:27,702 --> 00:33:29,460
Rym: Now the art is super generic.

642
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,318
Rym: I've literally nothing to say about the art.

643
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:43,880
Scott: I mean, it just looks like, you know, sort of a, you know, the more realistic kind of manga style, like closer to Urasawa, although not even like I was going to say five quality levels lower.

644
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:51,780
Scott: It's definitely a shadow of Urasawa like in terms of framing, It's the same, you know, it's that same realistic human beings real world style.

645
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:53,760
Scott: It's just the quality level.

646
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,100
Scott: I mean, it's not bad.

647
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:56,799
Scott: It's not like we're not saying Attack on Titan.

648
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,740
Scott: It's just unremarkable, right?

649
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:07,240
Scott: It's it gets the job done, you know, it's not like you're going to get prints from this or want sketches from the artist or anything.

650
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:08,580
Scott: Yeah, it's just a manga.

651
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,800
Scott: It's like, you know, it's really about the story.

652
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,719
Rym: It's like the writing in The Hunger Games.

653
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:18,899
Rym: It's not great writing, but it's a hundred percent serviceable writing that gets the story across without pissing me off.

654
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,159
Rym: Yeah, perfectly adequate.

655
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,636
Rym: Pretty much.

656
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:31,620
Rym: And the only real bad thing I can say about it is that a lot of the dialogue is really sort of that cliche.

657
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,859
Rym: This is a procedural drama about a thing.

658
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:41,819
Rym: So we're going to explain the thing to people who are like, it's almost like it's written for people who don't know what an r4 cartridge is.

659
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,960
Rym: Yeah, and don't know about like tunneling and RSA keys.

660
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,780
Rym: So there's a lot of like, hey, I'm cop number one.

661
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,638
Rym: What's that thing?

662
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,228
Scott: Oh, that's in technology.

663
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,399
Scott: in case the reader of this manga doesn't know it.

664
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:54,735
Rym: Yep.

665
00:34:55,001 --> 00:35:01,180
Rym: Oh, that is something that they use to copy game data that blah, blah, blah, whole history of the r4 cartridge in Japan.

666
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:05,559
Rym: That that text is a little annoying and tedious to read.

667
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:09,280
Scott: But only because, you know, if you didn't know, right, think about this.

668
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,740
Scott: You're in a cooking manga and they're like, what is that saffron?

669
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,400
Scott: Well, saffron is actually this piece of this flower.

670
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,220
Scott: And it's very expensive.

671
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,000
Rym: And you and I are like, oh, man, saffron.

672
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,020
Rym: And a chef is like, oh, God, I know all about saffron.

673
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,780
Scott: Jesus Christ, don't give me a saffron lesson.

674
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:25,999
Scott: Just get to the golden rice and the tears up.

675
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:37,200
Rym: So thus, I'm not going to say that that is a deep flaw by any stretch, because I would rather that happen than the actual underlying thing they're talking about be portrayed just wrong.

676
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:38,480
Scott: Yes, it's all correct.

677
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,340
Scott: Like the story of the R4 cartridge is the correct story.

678
00:35:42,004 --> 00:35:43,260
Scott: They don't say anything wrong about it.

679
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:59,317
Scott: And so if you're someone who doesn't know a lot about these things, this can actually be mildly educational and that it won't necessarily like make you a computer expert any more than Hajime No Ippo will let you beat Mike Tyson in the real world or anything like that.

680
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:04,440
Scott: But you will learn things about computers in real life that are true.

681
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:05,699
Scott: If you read this manga.

682
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:06,500
Rym: Oh, my God.

683
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:07,020
Rym: So I clicked.

684
00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:10,640
Rym: There's 12 posts about the fact that this was coming out on anime news network.

685
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,080
Rym: So I clicked on it just to see if anyone had said anything.

686
00:36:14,323 --> 00:36:20,400
Rym: You may look at this talk back page, but please consider that this article is one year, two months old before posting.

687
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:25,220
Rym: OK, I feel like that there is a problem.

688
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:25,883
Rym: So what are the?

689
00:36:26,105 --> 00:36:28,120
Scott: what are the comments about this manga on it?

690
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,639
Rym: Wait, I thought they didn't license Shueisha titles.

691
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:32,288
Rym: Sounds great.

692
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,480
Rym: Glad verticals doing this.

693
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,480
Rym: Glad verticals doing this.

694
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,257
Rym: Looking forward to this.

695
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,593
Scott: Yeah, that is interesting vertical.

696
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,159
Scott: One of the things they don't like.

697
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,080
Rym: We can, but this isn't a Shueisha title.

698
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:41,658
Scott: It's not.

699
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,858
Scott: But is it in Jump X?

700
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:43,914
Rym: It is.

701
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:45,520
Scott: But isn't Jump X Shueisha?

702
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:48,040
Rym: So I'm actually poking around.

703
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,680
Rym: I'm getting conflicting information about this manga.

704
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,899
Scott: This is very interesting.

705
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:53,040
Rym: Japanese movie.

706
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,578
Rym: There's a movie coming the next year.

707
00:36:55,204 --> 00:36:56,620
Scott: Oh, that movie will probably be interesting.

708
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,135
Rym: I learned that.

709
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,220
Rym: So the only actual source of information on this seems to be the French Wikipedia.

710
00:37:02,645 --> 00:37:03,459
Scott: Is it French movie?

711
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:05,660
Rym: Prophecy, manga et retortant.

712
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,899
Scott: The prophecy of the manga.

713
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,639
Rym: But we're not sure.

714
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:09,658
Rym: An internet anime.

715
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:11,552
Rym: Anonym.

716
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,179
Rym: Enfublue du mascot du coup d'un, du papier journale.

717
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,280
Rym: Qui annoucez des prophecy.

718
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:18,843
Rym: Okay.

719
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:20,314
Rym: Prophecy.

720
00:37:20,942 --> 00:37:22,239
Rym: No, prophetez.

721
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,228
Rym: Prophetez.

722
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:23,760
Scott: Yeah.

723
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,860
Scott: I'm not sure what, like, usually a title like prophecy.

724
00:37:29,342 --> 00:37:30,199
Scott: Pretty generic title.

725
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:30,620
Scott: Yeah.

726
00:37:30,821 --> 00:37:33,340
Scott: I can't see anything in here about any prophecy whatsoever.

727
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,257
Rym: Well, notice he prophesized it.

728
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,178
Rym: Basically, he says, this crime will occur.

729
00:37:39,201 --> 00:37:41,199
Rym: Oh, he's prophesying his own crimes.

730
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:43,800
Rym: He wears the newspaper as a mask, right?

731
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,719
Rym: On the current day.

732
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,120
Scott: So you know that he, right?

733
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,560
Scott: What day?

734
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:56,120
Rym: Basically, what the guy's doing to give you guys, he, he uploads a video to YouTube that he just recorded a little while ago of him saying, this crime is going to occur.

735
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:58,139
Rym: Like, right, like real soon.

736
00:37:58,424 --> 00:37:59,159
Scott: And he says, why?

737
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,820
Scott: He's like, justice is going to come down in this person because they fucked up.

738
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,599
Scott: And they'll fuck up the way they fucked up or you'll get the same done to you.

739
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,420
Rym: And then like within an hour, like before the police could even react, the crime he prophesized occurs, right?

740
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:18,220
Scott: Like he records the warning video, sets it to upload and sets it to publish, like right before the crime is about to happen.

741
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:22,700
Scott: And then he does the crime, like as the video is like made public on YouTube.

742
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,300
Rym: So I suspect that what's going to start happening is that this is just a guess.

743
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,620
Rym: I haven't, I've only read the first volume.

744
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:36,040
Rym: I would not be surprised if eventually he makes videos, prophesizing a crime, doesn't have to do anything.

745
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,100
Rym: Some anonymous rando then goes and commits the crime.

746
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:39,519
Scott: Awesome.

747
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:41,299
Rym: I think that's where this is going.

748
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:48,120
Rym: And this doesn't, like the manga doesn't shock me because this is like kind of baby's first, this idea.

749
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:48,497
Scott: Yeah.

750
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,260
Scott: There's nothing in here that's like surprising or new.

751
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:54,059
Scott: It's just a decent execution of things that I like.

752
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,520
Rym: Well, and if you're not fit, like if you read this and this seems all kind of scary or like dangerous.

753
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:06,660
Rym: Seriously guys in our professional opinions, this stuff is a hundred percent plausible.

754
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,920
Rym: I'm actually really, really surprised that something like this has not already happened.

755
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,020
Scott: Kind of has sort of not, not on any wide scale.

756
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:16,860
Rym: Not, I mean, it's kind of petered out.

757
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,519
Rym: No one's done something crazy.

758
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:28,360
Scott: Imagine if gamer gators were told to Rob game stops instead of being told to, you know, send rape threats.

759
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:28,923
Rym: Yup.

760
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,620
Scott: But black dynamite, you already robbed the game.

761
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:32,956
Scott: Stop.

762
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,223
Rym: Why?

763
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:37,300
Rym: I think we're done here.

764
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,260
Rym: It's I don't want, we're not going to just read it.

765
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:39,579
Rym: It's great.

766
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,640
Rym: It's not great, but it's perfectly good.

767
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:41,960
Rym: Manga.

768
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,560
Rym: It's new cheap.

769
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:44,113
Scott: Yeah.

770
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,036
Rym: There's nothing else like it in English that I know of.

771
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,580
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

772
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,260
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and brand.

773
00:39:59,382 --> 00:39:59,558
Rym: Okay.

774
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,376
Rym: For the logos.

Scott: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

776
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,659
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

777
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,399
Rym: Sci-tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.
