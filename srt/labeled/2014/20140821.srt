1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,137
Rym: It's Thursday, August 21st, 2014.

2
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:10,579
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:14,467
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,510
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,590
Rym: The angry video game nerd.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,777
Rym: The movie.

7
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,170
Rym: The experience.

8
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:24,628
Rym: Let's do this.

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,420
Rym: So, every year since the year 2000, I've gone to the Wildwoods, particularly North Wildwood.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:33,762
Rym: Really?

11
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:34,186
Scott: Even the year 2000?

12
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:35,740
Scott: It wasn't 2001 or 2002?

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,266
Scott: The first year.

14
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:37,340
Rym: That first summer.

15
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,380
Scott: I don't remember it being 2000.

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,721
Scott: Maybe it was 2001.

17
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:41,609
Scott: I graduated high school in 2000, so I guess that was the summer.

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,280
Rym: So yeah, it was '01, because it was the summer after our freshman year.

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,779
Scott: It had to at least be '01 at the earliest.

20
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,920
Rym: Yep, because it was the summer after our freshman year.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,173
Rym: Yeah.

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,472
Rym: So, I've gone there every year, and it's this beach that I just love going to.

23
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:00,039
Scott: It's not the greatest.

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,180
Rym: Within a four-hour drive of New York City, there are almost no, I can name no better public beach on an ocean.

25
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:11,752
Scott: I mean, beach-wise, right?

26
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:13,040
Scott: If you discount the people on the beach.

27
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:14,549
Rym: I'm just talking about the beach.

28
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,360
Rym: When did I say anything but the beach?

29
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:17,804
Scott: It's nice.

30
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,299
Scott: There's nice sands and nice waters.

31
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:19,998
Rym: Yeah, it is.

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,900
Scott: Nice times, and there's some good stuff there.

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,879
Rym: There's those little birds.

34
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:28,260
Scott: And there's a nice bookstore, and a nice alumni grill.

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,214
Scott: Nice Russos.

36
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:31,080
Scott: Good times.

37
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,400
Rym: Yeah, that Wawa right there that was replaced by the bigger Wawa.

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,136
Scott: Yeah, but the Boardwalk.

39
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,417
Rym: The Boardwalk has gone downhill, which is interesting.

40
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:43,380
Scott: Every single year it's gone downhill, and it hasn't gone uphill in any way.

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,380
Rym: But it's only gone downhill relative to what we want out of it.

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,618
Rym: Because what did we want out of it?

43
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:50,018
Scott: Arcades with decent games.

44
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,440
Rym: And literally, the garbage-ist of the garbage pizza.

45
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:59,000
Scott: And even one place to look at something remotely nerdy.

46
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:00,900
Scott: Anything.

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,460
Rym: Yep, but every year there were fewer arcades, and now the arcades are just dead.

48
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:06,479
Rym: There's literally...

49
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,337
Scott: There used to be a comic shop?

50
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:07,500
Scott: Nope.

51
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,020
Rym: There used to be like 15 or 16 DDR machines on that Boardwalk.

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,660
Rym: I'm not even joking or exaggerating.

53
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:14,477
Scott: And now, you're lucky if you can find one.

54
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,880
Rym: Yep, there was one broken pump-it-up machine, and one in the groove machine that was too quiet and you couldn't hear it last year.

55
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:29,580
Scott: The only current saving grace is that the place that used to have Fist of the North Star, which is not there anymore, now has play old pinball machines unlimitedly, basically.

56
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:33,320
Rym: Yeah, we're talking old, like made-out-of-wood pinball machines.

57
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,980
Scott: I'm pretty sure every pinball machine, even the newest ones, is somewhat made out of wood.

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,880
Rym: The flappers were made out of wood on a bunch of these things.

59
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,358
Rym: Mechanical scoreboards.

60
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,039
Scott: Yes, the good kind.

61
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,319
Rym: Yeah, but you know what?

62
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,479
Rym: You know how we always talk about how our one, like the biggest regret we both have in life, is not going to PAX as sooner than we did?

63
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:59,960
Rym: I do have a second, like my second regret in life on that list, is not buying that Fist of the North Star cabinet when it was on sale.

64
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:02,098
Scott: I do not regret not buying that.

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,451
Rym: Come on, it was like 800 bucks.

66
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,579
Scott: Okay, and getting it somewhere and keeping it somewhere, etc.

67
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,820
Rym: If I saw that machine on sale in Wildwood for 800 bucks today, I would buy it and deal with all those consequences later.

68
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,339
Scott: And it barely worked, and where would you put it?

69
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:18,280
Rym: I would have fixed it, because that would have been awesome.

70
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,231
Rym: Where would I put it?

71
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:19,759
Rym: Living room.

72
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,559
Scott: There's nowhere to put it in there.

73
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,520
Rym: I could fit it in there.

74
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,539
Scott: That would take up your whole living room.

75
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,499
Rym: It's not that big.

76
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,820
Scott: It would have to also be your television.

77
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:27,720
Scott: It would be a vertical television.

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,060
Rym: I would replace the wine cabinet.

79
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:30,660
Scott: You could only watch it laying on your side.

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,660
Rym: I could replace the piano or the wine cabinet.

81
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,800
Scott: You could replace the piano, then no one can sit at the table.

82
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:39,859
Rym: I just really want that thing.

83
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,391
Scott: Yeah, I really want a DDR machine.

84
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:43,360
Scott: You don't see me buying one.

85
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:48,859
Rym: I had to book a place, because for the first time, I'm not just staying at a friend's house, because the friend had a baby.

86
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:54,879
Scott: I feel like half the reason to go is because all these people I know are going, and spending time with them.

87
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,000
Rym: Some of those people are going anyway, so that friend is going regardless.

88
00:03:59,363 --> 00:03:59,799
Scott: Oh, really?

89
00:04:00,642 --> 00:04:04,860
Rym: But arriving Saturday, because for them, a day trip's fine, but a day trip for us sucks.

90
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:07,780
Rym: So he's going to be there Saturday afternoon.

91
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,080
Scott: Then why are you booking a place?

92
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,260
Rym: Because we want to get there Friday.

93
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,880
Scott: Okay, but he's only getting the place Friday?

94
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,076
Rym: No, I'm going to Saturday, too.

95
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:15,528
Rym: All right.

96
00:04:17,362 --> 00:04:20,079
Rym: Solves a few problems logistically and all that, but regardless.

97
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:33,120
Rym: It's been a long time since I've had to arrange transportation, or hotels, or order food in a place where no one knows how to use the internet.

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,240
Rym: Good God, can you not?

99
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,659
Rym: I had to call hotels and be like, "What do your rooms cost?

100
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:42,620
Rym: Do you have one available on this weekend?

101
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:43,747
Rym: Do you have

102
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:44,010
Rym: parking?".

103
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:46,730
Rym: A lot of these people don't even have email addresses.

104
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,190
Rym: Every hotel there, if they have a website, has a rates page.

105
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:53,516
Rym: that is their gigantic page.

106
00:04:53,557 --> 00:05:01,529
Rym: that explains this really convoluted system for what their rooms cost, and there's no way to know if they have vacancies or not other than calling them.

107
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:03,690
Rym: A few places have email addresses.

108
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:15,158
Scott: Let's contrast this to Australia, where we stayed at an equally tiny motel on some island in the off-season, and not only were we able to handle that entire thing technologically,

109
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:16,163
Rym: but

110
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:24,028
Scott: the dude, when we showed up there in the little motel office in the front, was able to use the internet on some sort of local island land

111
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:24,310
Rym: or something.

112
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,626
Rym: Yeah, he was like, "Here's the tide schedule in case you go

113
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:27,109
Rym: hiking.".

114
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:33,888
Scott: Yeah, he knew when the boat that went out to look at the seals was coming and leaving, a daily report came in.

115
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,289
Rym: Yep, when he said, "One moment, let me see what the schedule

116
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,410
Rym: is.".

117
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:44,730
Scott: We could buy tickets to anything on the whole island at any other place on the island because they all partnered with each other technologically.

118
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,344
Rym: Seriously though, and I was like, "Oh, maybe I'll just do

119
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:49,585
Rym: Airbnb.".

120
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:53,825
Rym: No one in Wildwood uses Airbnb.

121
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:54,669
Rym: Zero.

122
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:03,490
Scott: I feel like if you bought a hotel and just made it internet-y, that you could basically fill up immediately because you would get all the business from anyone who was internet-y.

123
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,925
Rym: So I discovered something, and I kind of want to do some investigative journalism on this because I just booked directly with hotels on their websites.

124
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:09,529
Rym: That's what you do.

125
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:14,130
Rym: So I looked on Hotels.com, like one of those kinds of sites.

126
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,190
Scott: Or Priceline or one of those.

127
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,590
Rym: And they listed a lot of these hotels that don't have online registration.

128
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:26,130
Rym: And they listed them at prices that were like $200+ above the rate if you call the hotel directly.

129
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:36,099
Rym: I think these hotels are just smart enough to make a room online somewhere with a ridiculous price that no one will ever reserve.

130
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,870
Rym: because if someone does, jackpot!

131
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:44,490
Rym: And if no one does, free advertisement for the hotel on the site that internet people are looking at.

132
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,070
Scott: You're neglecting another possibility.

133
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:59,850
Scott: The Priceline, or whoever what site it is, sees this hotel as not internet-y and just fucking lists it at a ridiculous price, and if you buy it, that money is like a service charge that uses for them to deal with the bullshit of calling the hotel.

134
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:09,510
Rym: You know, it is also possible, but based on reading some reviews people had on other sites, I saw that a common refrain... These hotels are like...

135
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:13,189
Scott: I registered for this hotel at Hotels.com and I got there and they didn't know who I was?

136
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:19,717
Rym: It was more the hotels themselves responding on like Yelp saying, "Yeah, just call us direct.

137
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,825
Rym: Don't use the room that we put up on

138
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:22,688
Rym: whatever.com.".

139
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:24,906
Rym: So I think the hotels do it.

140
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,410
Rym: No, it's weird.

141
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:44,010
Rym: It's weird when I interact with a small business that seems to be like family-run, or the people who run it take things personally and take a personal interest in these really low-level things, and I kind of actually really prefer the faceless corporate interactions in these situations.

142
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,450
Scott: That's why it's much better to have the management company and not a landlord as a human being.

143
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:58,729
Rym: I like the fact that while we've had issues with our apartment, our landlord is a faceless company that gives zero fucks about us, which means they don't pry too much into my business.

144
00:08:00,352 --> 00:08:03,110
Rym: Unlike some other friends we know and their landlord issues.

145
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:18,010
Rym: So yeah, the moral of the story, it really sucks when businesses don't do stuff on the internet, and there is a divide between businesses that are internet and businesses that are not, and I think the place that's happening first...

146
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,590
Scott: There's a divide between the world that is internet and the world that is not.

147
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:30,070
Rym: But in the US, like in New York, I think in the next few years, low, crappy-level Chinese places that aren't on Grubhub are just going out of business, unless they're in Chinatown.

148
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,110
Rym: I think bit by bit, things that you can't order online are invisible.

149
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,052
Scott: Maybe.

150
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:37,110
Scott: Anyway.

151
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,481
Scott: Anyway.

152
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:47,322
Scott: So remember that deal where the guy was really upset, everyone was using his monkey photo on Wikipedia, and some of the Wikipedia editors were like, "We've got to take this down,".

153
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:50,767
Scott: and some of them were like, "No, a monkey took the picture, therefore it

154
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:51,149
Scott: stays.".

155
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:54,448
Rym: And there was a pretty good debate in our forum about that shit, too.

156
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:03,930
Scott: The Wikipedia people were fighting with each other, and then I guess the people on Wikipedia decided it would stay up, one, in the Wikipedia community, and then in our community.

157
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:13,910
Scott: And it's like, while I'm not really a copyright fan, I was actually siding on, look, this dude set this shit up, right?

158
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:17,950
Scott: He didn't take that specific picture, but he set this up.

159
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:20,869
Scott: His effort went towards creating this thing.

160
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:29,770
Rym: I could, for example-- Well, I think Luke Burge and a couple other people, they pointed out there's a common precedent for setting a trap that automatically takes a picture.

161
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:31,490
Rym: The trap doesn't get copyrighted.

162
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:36,090
Scott: If I use a lightning trigger to take lightning photos-- The lightning gets the copyright.

163
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,474
Scott: Right.

164
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:37,044
Scott: That's ridiculous.

165
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,490
Scott: It's really hard to fucking take lightning photos.

166
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,370
Rym: If I spend the money for a lightning trigger and set that shit up-- I want to send you a cease and desist from an individual photon.

167
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,170
Scott: And set the exposure for the skyline and whatever.

168
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,490
Scott: If you believe in copyright, which, you know, we're not going to discuss that right now.

169
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,190
Scott: We're just assuming copyright is what it is and we believe in it.

170
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,652
Scott: I believe

171
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:57,972
Rym: in copyright in the same way that I believe-- We believe

172
00:09:57,992 --> 00:10:00,211
Scott: in the current copyright law that exists in the U.S No, I'm

173
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:06,110
Rym: saying I believe in it in the same sense that I believe that I'm holding a screw in my hand right now and a hair tie.

174
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,930
Rym: Those are physical things that exist.

175
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,562
Scott: If you agree with current U.S.

176
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:18,790
Scott: copyright policy, under that law and policy, me doing that thing with the lightning trigger, I should own the copyright on that and be able to make money by selling that picture.

177
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,509
Scott: That was quite a pain in the ass to take.

178
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,370
Scott: It cost money, time, and effort.

179
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:24,030
Scott: You know, it's not trivial.

180
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:32,770
Scott: So, I was actually saying, well, yeah, you know, morally, whatever, copyright, I don't think anyone should copyright some freaking photo of a monkey, whatever.

181
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:39,190
Scott: But, if you are going to say copyright, I was on his side that like, yeah, you own that monkey photo, dude.

182
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,270
Scott: So I wasn't-- Just because a monkey pushed the button.

183
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,149
Rym: But I'm going to say this.

184
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:49,290
Rym: The only reason I wasn't is because I wanted to see a hilarious and fundamentally shaking court case.

185
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,810
Rym: I wanted to see some weird, crazy challenge to copyright law.

186
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,769
Rym: That's the only reason.

187
00:10:54,331 --> 00:11:16,490
Scott: So, today, the Copyright Office, which I think is actually part of the Library of Congress, it's a weird thing, anyway, they released their third edition of their official practices, which is sort of a law, but part of it is a thing that says, here are the guidelines for what we will and will not register as copyrightable.

188
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,289
Scott: And so, registering a copyright is not something you have to do.

189
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,590
Scott: If you just make some art, like you just take some paint and throw it to canvas, you own the copyright on that.

190
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,569
Rym: Copyright is automatic and intrinsic.

191
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:39,050
Scott: You don't have to do anything, but if you do register it, which is optional, then that gives you some extra benefits, such as, you know, it gives you the right to sue and receive statutory damages.

192
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,590
Rym: As opposed to just direct damages.

193
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,409
Scott: As opposed to other damages, right?

194
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:52,830
Scott: So, anyway, in this new official practices third edition, they gave some examples of things that they will not register.

195
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:55,990
Scott: The first example is a photograph taken by a monkey.

196
00:11:56,772 --> 00:12:04,330
Scott: Other examples include a mural painted by an elephant, because there is an elephant that paints, a claim based on the appearance of actual animal skin.

197
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:12,770
Scott: So, it's like, I guess, if you see an animal and there's some art shaped in its skin, or like a cow where the black spot in the cow is shaped like something.

198
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,190
Rym: Check out my cat that looks exactly like the Mona Lisa.

199
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:17,812
Scott: Right.

200
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:20,750
Scott: A claim based on driftwood that has been shaped and moved by the ocean.

201
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,510
Scott: So, you find a piece of driftwood that just happens to be incredibly awesomely shaped.

202
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:26,109
Scott: It was done by the ocean.

203
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,510
Scott: A claim based on cut marks, defects, and other qualities found in natural stones.

204
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:37,190
Scott: You find a rock that's just awesome, and you just try to copyright the shape of that rock, because it's an awesome, you know, make it tricky.

205
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,041
Scott: It's like, oh, I found this rock.

206
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:40,450
Scott: This is a sculpture that I made.

207
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,998
Rym: I didn't read the whole thing.

208
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,970
Rym: Did they give just examples or rationale?

209
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,350
Scott: No, this is the list I'm seeing here, but it's like, this is a list of things they will not register.

210
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:58,890
Rym: I was wondering what the rationale was, and I suspect that the monkey example, if that's actually in there, was added because of the current discussions.

211
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:07,349
Scott: It just says, the law only protects the fruits of intellectual labor that are founded in the creative powers of the mind.

212
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,488
Scott: Original intellectual conceptions of the author.

213
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:19,550
Scott: If a human being did not create the work, the office will not register works produced by nature, animals, or plants.

214
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:34,310
Scott: Likewise, the office cannot register a work purportedly created by divine or supernatural beings, although the office may register a work where the application or the deposit copies state that the work was inspired by a divine spirit.

215
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:44,909
Rym: I was going to go with a much more direct challenge under the idea that they would have to argue whether or not the photographer intended to take the picture of the monkey or not.

216
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:48,290
Rym: Like, did he leave it there for the monkey to find, or did the monkey just find it?

217
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:56,610
Scott: I'm sure he intended for monkeys to come and take the picture, but that specific picture of monkey taking that pose was just, you know, the luck of the draw, right?

218
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,879
Scott: He was going to get monkey pictures.

219
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,470
Scott: He set it up as a monkey trap.

220
00:13:59,690 --> 00:13:59,872
Rym: Maybe.

221
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,490
Rym: He could have just been killed by monkeys.

222
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:13,890
Scott: It's like, if I take pictures of lightning with a lightning trigger, it's like, yeah, I intended to take pictures of lightning in that frame with this exposure, but did I know that exact lightning bolt shape was going to happen?

223
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:14,692
Scott: No.

224
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:15,538
Scott: I can't.

225
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,189
Scott: I'm not supposed to control the fucking light, Thor.

226
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:19,590
Scott: If I was Thor, I wouldn't need a lightning trigger.

227
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,885
Scott: I would just push the button and swing my hammer at the same time, right?

228
00:14:25,012 --> 00:14:27,130
Scott: And the lightning would come down exactly the shape I want.

229
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,890
Scott: It would be the big lightning, penis-shaped lightning.

230
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,429
Scott: I get the greatest photo of all time.

231
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,709
Rym: So this actually might have some interesting far-reaching consequences.

232
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:36,852
Scott: It does.

233
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:42,474
Scott: I wonder how many copyrighted things now we can just fucking say, "Oh, that's public domain.

234
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:45,590
Scott: Fuck you," because it was made by animals or nature or something.

235
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,890
Rym: Well, you know, there was another argument, too.

236
00:14:48,131 --> 00:15:01,510
Rym: I was making a very side argument in the forum just for fun, that because of the debate around the picture, most uses of the picture were therefore fair use in discussion of the picture itself, because the picture was newsworthy and notable.

237
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:02,147
Scott: Sure.

238
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,390
Rym: So that was just kind of a side step.

239
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,389
Rym: That's the kind of bullshit that the Supreme Court would do if they didn't want to rule on the actual issue.

240
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:10,988
Scott: Anyway, so there you go.

241
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,909
Rym: So I got a crazy story for you guys.

242
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,077
Rym: So this is on FARC.

243
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:17,930
Rym: I found this news, but this is legitimate news.

244
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:21,450
Rym: A guy, I guess he's in the sneaker trade.

245
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,830
Rym: Like, you know those kids who line up and buy those ridiculous, expensive sneakers?

246
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,270
Scott: Oh, so he lines up, buys them, and sells them for more on eBay?

247
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:34,029
Rym: I'm not sure what he actually does, but he's involved in that, and he went to his sneaker convention, and he made a lot of money at it doing his thing.

248
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,389
Scott: Well, yeah, I mean, that's his deal.

249
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,587
Rym: So he posted on, it looks like, they say social media.

250
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,330
Rym: I think it's Facebook.

251
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,437
Rym: A picture of the money.

252
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,030
Rym: It's a lot of money.

253
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,049
Scott: Oh, it's all cash.

254
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:47,388
Rym: It looks like 20, 25 grand just based on this photo.

255
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,750
Scott: Now he's going to get robbed?

256
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,230
Rym: He got murdered and robbed the next night after he posted the photo.

257
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,209
Scott: Yeah, good job, dude.

258
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,910
Rym: Yeah, the moral is, if you have 20 to 25 thousand dollars in cash...

259
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,749
Scott: Armored car, bank, you know the bank has that weird thing, that metal thing?

260
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:07,730
Rym: If you take a picture of it, post it to social media after you took it to the bank.

261
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,829
Scott: Listen, someone might come...

262
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,530
Rym: But that would not have stopped him from being murdered.

263
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,869
Scott: Someone might come and murder you anyway, and then look for the money, and they can't find it.

264
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:20,769
Rym: So, what's worse is that, I'm reading some follow-up here, because the story has more info since when I was first looking at it.

265
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:31,970
Rym: The person who shot him and went to steal the money may have been there trying to steal his shoes instead, and may not have known about the money.

266
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:34,009
Scott: Oh, and the money's still there?

267
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:48,590
Rym: There's a, Fark is speculating that the guy might have sold shoes to this kid, and then when he saw the picture, became enraged that the kid made a lot of money and might have paid him a couple hundred bucks for these multi-thousand dollar shoes or something.

268
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,430
Rym: But, I don't know, I have no idea.

269
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,150
Rym: This is the kind of story where you will literally never find out what actually happened.

270
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:02,650
Rym: But the moral is, if you have tens of thousands of dollars of cash, do not take a picture of it and just post it publicly on social media.

271
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,750
Scott: I got two better morals.

272
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:09,770
Scott: Moral number one, don't be involved in shady, stupid businesses like selling ridiculously overpriced sneakers.

273
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:18,170
Scott: Number two, if you want someone to get killed, take a picture of money, hack their Twitter, just find out their password.

274
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,609
Scott: You know, you can't hack this, right?

275
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:28,668
Scott: Find out their password, post it on their Twitter with the GPS location of their house, and hope someone comes and robs them and kills them, and then you'll get away with it.

276
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:33,370
Rym: Yeah, well that's just a twist on the old put child porn on someone's computer gag.

277
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:35,929
Scott: It doesn't end with them dead.

278
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,370
Rym: It ends up with them in jail forever.

279
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:40,570
Scott: Maybe.

280
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:46,008
Rym: Yeah, I mean, how Monte Cristoian is your revenge at this point?

281
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:56,950
Rym: So things of the day!

282
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:00,390
Rym: This is utterly, utterly wonderful.

283
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:07,830
Rym: So apparently, people in Bulgaria are vandalizing old monuments to Soviet bullshit.

284
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:15,610
Scott: Okay, well I mean, come on, if there were British monuments lying about in the US, and it was still, I mean, remember, this is recent history.

285
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:16,349
Rym: Yes, and Britain.

286
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:17,361
Rym: So in 1790-something.

287
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,365
Rym: And Britain was being a punk on the international scene to us.

288
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:29,309
Scott: Right, so it's 1790, you're in the US, there's British monuments, and you still don't like Britain and you live in the US, you are vandalizing the fuck out of those.

289
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:31,770
Rym: So that is what's happening in Bulgaria.

290
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:33,029
Scott: Of course, why wouldn't it?

291
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:44,650
Rym: What these vandals are doing is painting statues that are parts of these monuments to be superheroes, like Superman and the Joker and Robin and Wonder Woman and Captain America.

292
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,329
Scott: So not only are they vandalizing, they're excellent vandalizing.

293
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,590
Rym: This is so high quality.

294
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,790
Rym: My hat is off to you, Bulgarian punk kids with spray paint.

295
00:18:55,696 --> 00:18:56,550
Rym: These are amazing.

296
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:04,550
Rym: And also, what's even more hilarious, Russia is legit angry about this and is demanding that Bulgaria take action.

297
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,770
Scott: Demanding this other country take action to do something about some other person.

298
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,626
Scott: It's like, you left, you gave me something, or I took it back from you.

299
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,590
Scott: that was rightfully mine.

300
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,409
Scott: It's in my house, and you don't like how I'm using it.

301
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:28,829
Scott: I got my NES, it's actually your NES that you stole, and I got it back, and I'm playing Mega Man, and you're like, "Stop playing Mega Man on my NES.

302
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,305
Scott: Buy the commando

303
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:30,668
Scott: only.".

304
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:37,767
Scott: And I'm like, "I'm in my house with my NES now, just because it used to be yours, because you were pointing a gun at

305
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:37,868
Scott: me.".

306
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:40,190
Rym: So there's a similar war crimes.

307
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,750
Scott: I'm going to play Mega Man 2 extra, just to piss you off more.

308
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:48,248
Rym: There is a war crime/monument incident that happened to me as a kid involving Mega Man 3. that's very relevant to this.

309
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:49,350
Scott: War crimes?

310
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,830
Rym: So when I was a kid, there was a kid in my neighborhood who was kind of a little shit.

311
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:54,236
Scott: Okay.

312
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,482
Rym: And there was another kid who was a...

313
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,570
Scott: Did he get shot, because is it true?

314
00:19:59,710 --> 00:19:59,817
Rym: No, no.

315
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:09,990
Rym: So the other kid was one of those horrific lower-middle-class bullies, like stereotype to a T of this particular kind of bully.

316
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,169
Scott: Like, was he like on The Simpsons, was he Nelson going, "Heh, heh,".

317
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,989
Scott: or was he the older kids?

318
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,029
Rym: He was more like Jimbo.

319
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:23,950
Rym: So that kid actually, unrelatedly, was eventually shot to death by his mother after him and his father tried to light her car on fire.

320
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,290
Rym: I learned that like five years after the fact.

321
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:27,188
Scott: So, yeah, Jimbo.

322
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,209
Rym: Yeah, beside the point.

323
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:42,329
Rym: So the little shit one day came over to my house, and I'd hang out with this kid occasionally, just because, you know, when you're a kid in like middle school, you kind of hang out with a lot of kids in the neighborhood, regardless of whether or not you like them.

324
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:47,430
Rym: This little shit was the kid who, like, we'd have a super soaker war, he'd show up with a super soaker backpack.

325
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,830
Scott: Yeah, that means he had money.

326
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,439
Rym: He did.

327
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:53,250
Rym: So one day he comes over and we're playing NES games.

328
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,248
Scott: More parents who spoiled him.

329
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,807
Rym: And then he was like, "Hey, you want a trade

330
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:57,170
Rym: game?".

331
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,650
Rym: And he's holding Hydlide.

332
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,155
Rym: And I'm like, "Maybe.

333
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:05,748
Rym: What do you want for that Mega Man

334
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:06,733
Rym: 3?".

335
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:11,565
Rym: And he looks down at the Hydlide he's holding, and he's like, "I'll trade you my Mega Man 3 for this

336
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:12,027
Rym: game.".

337
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:13,890
Rym: He'd never played Hydlide.

338
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,450
Rym: He was looking just at the cover.

339
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:18,611
Rym: So I said, "Yes," and I took Mega Man 3.

340
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,390
Scott: And you gave him Hydlide?

341
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:20,289
Rym: Gave him Hydlide.

342
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,282
Rym: So you didn't get ripped off.

343
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:21,910
Scott: He got ripped off.

344
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:22,728
Rym: He got ripped off.

345
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:23,634
Rym: So...

346
00:21:24,053 --> 00:21:24,570
Scott: He got pissed.

347
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:29,970
Rym: So then, later, he's over at our house, and I'm playing Mega Man 3, and I'm just cheating.

348
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,050
Rym: So I'm doing that thing where you use the second controller, just like that awesome glitch.

349
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,810
Rym: And he got really mad that I was playing the game wrong.

350
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:39,830
Rym: And he wanted to trade back.

351
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,695
Rym: And I was like, "No.

352
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:41,722
Rym: No, no, no.

353
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:42,326
Rym: We made a trade.

354
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:42,487
Rym: It's

355
00:21:42,587 --> 00:21:42,748
Rym: over.".

356
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:43,490
Rym: It's over.

357
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,388
Rym: I'm sorry Hydlide sucks, but...

358
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:47,529
Scott: You made mistakes were made.

359
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:49,149
Scott: And they're gonna stay made.

360
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:56,088
Rym: So then, the next day, the other bad kids, like, Jimbo's mom comes over.

361
00:21:56,792 --> 00:22:00,788
Rym: And Jimbo's mom says that we stole something from her son.

362
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,830
Scott: Oh, so the little shit took the Mega Man 3?

363
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,350
Rym: The little shit had acquired that Mega Man 3 under dubious pretense and traded it to me for Hydlide.

364
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,130
Scott: So he stole it from Jimbo and traded it to you for Hydlide.

365
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:18,330
Rym: Yes, and then had the gall to try to get it back from me by claiming, falsely, that I was playing the game incorrectly.

366
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,310
Rym: Take that, Russia.

367
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,890
Scott: So you kept the Mega Man 3?

368
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:38,910
Rym: Actually, because it appeared to be stolen, and because the advice that my dad gave me, which applies to times we've interacted with people in Beacon, is someone and/or their family poor and has likely nothing to lose of value?

369
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,649
Rym: Do not antagonize them, even if you are correct.

370
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:46,189
Rym: Because they will explode themselves to explode on you.

371
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:50,411
Scott: Did your parents then buy you a Mega Man 3?

372
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,670
Rym: I bought Mega Man 3 at a garage sale for, like, 20 bucks, three or four months later.

373
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,041
Scott: There you go.

374
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:11,950
Rym: But it's kind of like if someone crazy in a beat-up car messes with you and maybe bumps your car and runs away, if you call the police and try to sue them, and they find out who you are, they're going to key your car and egg your house for the rest of the time you live in that neighborhood.

375
00:23:13,752 --> 00:23:16,390
Rym: So anyway, you got a thing of the day?

376
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,589
Scott: I do have a thing of the day.

377
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,690
Rym: After my long, rambling anecdote?

378
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,950
Scott: So America's Test Kitchen did some testing, and they found something fascinating.

379
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:25,987
Scott: Uh-oh.

380
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,230
Scott: They saw it and I found it fascinating.

381
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,269
Scott: So, steak.

382
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,430
Scott: The thing that has been studied perhaps more than any other food ever.

383
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,750
Scott: Common sense would be, if you have a steak and it's fresh, you just fucking cook that shit.

384
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,002
Rym: No, you age steaks.

385
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:38,750
Rym: That's common knowledge.

386
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,548
Scott: Well, also that.

387
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,610
Scott: But the point is, you cook it fresh.

388
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:43,710
Scott: And they agree that is the best way.

389
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:44,869
Scott: You cook a fresh steak.

390
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:45,264
Rym: Okay.

391
00:23:45,971 --> 00:23:50,008
Scott: Let's say you have just too much steak, and you must freeze it.

392
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:59,269
Scott: The common sense would be, if you have a steak that you had to freeze, you don't want to freeze it if you don't have to, but if you had to freeze it, you have a frozen steak already and you want to cook it.

393
00:23:59,630 --> 00:23:59,705
Rym: Yep.

394
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:06,810
Scott: People, the common sense would be that you would thaw that shit to bring it to room temperature and then cook it.

395
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,130
Rym: That is in fact what most of my cookbooks recommend.

396
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,577
Scott: That is what almost everyone... America's Test Kitchen tested.

397
00:24:15,863 --> 00:24:18,470
Scott: what to do if you have already a frozen steak.

398
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,790
Scott: And apparently, you do not let it thaw.

399
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,290
Scott: You can cook it frozen, and it's better.

400
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:33,129
Scott: Now, you have to freeze it in the correct way, which they also show you how to freeze it without it getting all frosty and shit.

401
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:36,910
Rym: This is sounding pretty fascinating.

402
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,191
Rym: But

403
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:53,789
Scott: basically, the long and short of it is that when you cook it when it's already frozen, if you do it properly, the outside is going to heat up really fast and get cooked, and the inside is really cold, so as long as you cook it enough, and it does take longer to cook and more effort.

404
00:24:55,614 --> 00:25:16,108
Scott: But because the inside was colder, basically, the non-pink area on the edge will be really thin, and the inside will be mad pink, whereas if you let it thaw, the gray area will be a couple of millimeters thick, and the pink area will be much smaller, and basically, all of their tasting...

405
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,209
Rym: Do I need to cook it at a different temperature now?

406
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,850
Scott: You have to follow the instructions in the video I'm linking you to.

407
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:22,146
Rym: Okay.

408
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:23,306
Rym: Okay.

409
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,990
Scott: For both freezing and cooking.

410
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,390
Scott: This is only if you have a frozen steak.

411
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,386
Scott: If your steak is fresh...

412
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:32,590
Rym: If you already found the war atrocity, and you're just trying to mitigate the damage.

413
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:37,709
Scott: Or if you bought a whole ton of fucking steak, and you have to freeze some of it, right?

414
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,190
Scott: Because you cannot cook it.

415
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,737
Scott: You have too much.

416
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:40,489
Scott: You can't cook it all.

417
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:42,129
Scott: Fresh is still better.

418
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:43,365
Scott: The end.

419
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,709
Rym: I like how many times you had to qualify that.

420
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:52,650
Scott: Because obviously, I don't want people coming up to me and being like, "No way frozen steak is better than fresh steak.

421
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,503
Scott: I got to ward that

422
00:25:53,646 --> 00:25:53,727
Scott: off.".

423
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,689
Scott: Because you know someone's going to say that if I come and be like...

424
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,730
Rym: Yeah, but blacked out of mine.

425
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,950
Rym: I take quotes out of context in the community.

426
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,849
Scott: You're overusing and sometimes really stretching your use of black dynamite.

427
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,069
Rym: I like saying black... I just like saying black dynamite.

428
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,264
Scott: You're supposed to say, "But black

429
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:09,770
Scott: dynamite."

430
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:11,608
Scott: I stretch and sometimes misuse.

431
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:17,630
Scott: But black dynamite.

432
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:18,270
Rym: Okay.

433
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,870
Rym: So in about a moment, the Book Club book is a category for Leibovitz.

434
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,750
Rym: Scott will probably read it when winter comes.

435
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,950
Rym: So hang tight.

436
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,430
Scott: It's coming.

437
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,410
Rym: It's coming.

438
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,139
Rym: Yeah.

439
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:29,829
Rym: I've read a few more books since then.

440
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:30,303
Scott: Okay.

441
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:32,090
Rym: We are going to be at PAX Prime.

442
00:26:32,932 --> 00:26:37,685
Rym: We are doing a lecture called "How to Win Every

443
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:38,389
Rym: Game."

444
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,269
Rym: Not just some games.

445
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,189
Scott: Not just one game.

446
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:40,789
Scott: Every game.

447
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,669
Rym: It seems obvious that when playing a game of skill, one attempts to win.

448
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,588
Rym: Interestingly, this is not often the case.

449
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,510
Scott: Why are you reading the description from the PAX catalog?

450
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,970
Rym: Even skilled gamers rarely analyze to any real depth the underlying mechanics of a given game, blah, blah, blah.

451
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,810
Rym: We'll teach you specific examples like Stratego, Settlers of Catan, and even football.

452
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,250
Scott: So not that you can change your mind about going to PAX at this point.

453
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,890
Scott: At least 99.9% of people on Earth can't really suddenly decide to go now.

454
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,830
Scott: Whoever's going is going.

455
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,110
Scott: Whoever's not going is not going.

456
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:12,010
Scott: But the guidebook came out, and the schedule is already up, but because the guidebook came out, I actually looked at the schedule.

457
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:13,027
Rym: I was looking at it too.

458
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:14,469
Scott: And I learned two things.

459
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:21,310
Scott: Number one, the guy who created Final Fantasy is going to be there.

460
00:27:21,731 --> 00:27:25,030
Scott: Not Nobu, who we've seen at every convention ever, who made the music.

461
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:27,310
Scott: Not Amano, who made the art.

462
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:30,529
Scott: The guy who made the game is going to be there.

463
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,448
Scott: I never even thought of that.

464
00:27:33,032 --> 00:27:35,769
Scott: It's like a guest I wanted to see, I didn't even know I wanted to see.

465
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:43,990
Scott: Obviously, some of the big names that are always there are going to be there, like I think Inafune is going to be there again with his mighty numbers and whatever.

466
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:45,808
Scott: I learned something else.

467
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:51,750
Scott: The guy who made Tetris is going to be there.

468
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,690
Rym: And somehow is not doing the keynote.

469
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:55,327
Scott: Are you kidding me?

470
00:27:57,631 --> 00:28:00,649
Scott: Someone I wanted to see, I didn't even know I wanted to see.

471
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,430
Scott: And now I've got to wait up how long to go to that panel.

472
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,410
Scott: And he also has an autograph thing that I'm not going to wait in line for.

473
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,250
Rym: The thing is, ever since they stopped doing the Q&A...

474
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,510
Scott: Should I go and buy on eBay a Game Boy Tetris really quick?

475
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:15,069
Scott: I don't care about autographs, but just like, it's how you make Tetris.

476
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:16,688
Scott: Are you kidding me?

477
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,770
Rym: The third thing in my life that I regret is eating that food that gave me food poisoning.

478
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:31,710
Rym: But the fourth thing is that we didn't get up a couple hours earlier so I could get my Zelda 2 signed by Miyamoto.

479
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,968
Scott: I guess we could have done that.

480
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:34,778
Rym: We could have.

481
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,630
Rym: We should have.

482
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:42,070
Rym: We chose not to, and we had to live with the decisions that we made because our lives are, in fact, the sum of the decisions we made.

483
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,569
Scott: It just so happens, if you look at the PAX schedule this year, right?

484
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:48,430
Scott: Let me just open my guidebook here for a second.

485
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,490
Rym: I got my guidebook open.

486
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:50,629
Scott: Hold on, let me open my guidebook.

487
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,370
Scott: No, not MAGFest 12, PAX Prime 2014.

488
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,629
Scott: Shows how many conventions I'm going to.

489
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:57,488
Scott: My schedule.

490
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:01,010
Scott: So, Friday, all I have in my schedule is a keynote.

491
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,230
Scott: Saturday, there's a bunch of stuff I kind of want to do on Saturday.

492
00:29:06,531 --> 00:29:09,044
Scott: There's a video game data panel, which I think is an update of that one.

493
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,250
Scott: Alex went to that one time.

494
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,790
Scott: And Alex Levitt has his Twitch Played Pokemon panel.

495
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,670
Scott: And there's a Luke Crane panels twice on Saturday.

496
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:18,910
Scott: But I'm probably going to spend all Saturday playing Netrunner.

497
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:25,030
Scott: On Sunday, this Tetris panel, is it three on Saturday?

498
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,249
Rym: I feel like we should go to that.

499
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,000
Scott: Yeah, I mean Sunday.

500
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:29,170
Scott: Is it three on Sunday?

501
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,350
Scott: And the Pac-Man CEDX tournament is at seven on Sunday.

502
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:34,870
Rym: Is that going to be your Sunday night?

503
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:40,587
Scott: For once, the Pac-Man CEDX tournament does not conflict with anything else I could possibly want to do at PAX.

504
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,374
Scott: This is the first time.

505
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:44,529
Scott: They've had this tournament at every PAX I've been to.

506
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:47,926
Scott: Maybe not Australia, but it is always conflicted with something.

507
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:48,810
Scott: It does not conflict.

508
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,969
Scott: I might have to go practice Pac-Man when I get home because I haven't played in months.

509
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,770
Scott: And then, of course, our panel and Omegathon final on Monday.

510
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,708
Rym: Monday, Sandworm Theater, noon.

511
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:00,734
Scott: Noon.

512
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:01,769
Rym: There you go.

513
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:02,331
Rym: Yup.

514
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:05,310
Rym: We'll try to do some video and cool other stuff from the convention.

515
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:12,270
Rym: And if you're a GeekNights fan and you want to hang out with us, we're going to basically do an official GeekNights meetup.

516
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:16,350
Rym: Come to our panel or hang around near it if you can't get in because it fills up.

517
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,670
Rym: And after that, we can all sort of go into the Omegathon line together.

518
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:23,450
Scott: Well, I was going to meet that guy for lunch after the panel.

519
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:24,889
Scott: But we can do after that.

520
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:25,788
Rym: Oh, which guy?

521
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:27,269
Scott: The YouTube guy.

522
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:28,144
Rym: Oh, that guy.

523
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:28,390
Rym: Okay.

524
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,740
Scott: Yeah, so our panel is going to go to one.

525
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:33,370
Scott: Omegathon is at 5.30.

526
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:33,458
Rym: Yeah.

527
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,569
Scott: So we'll probably go eat lunch.

528
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:37,569
Rym: So what I'm saying is...

529
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,270
Scott: And then go to the Omegathon line and have a meetup.

530
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:47,469
Rym: Meet us at or after the panel and we will provide the details of the actual, like, for real hangout Omegathon lineup.

531
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,570
Scott: Yeah, that's still the best meetup location and time that we can give.

532
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:56,150
Scott: That's a guarantee because we're going to be at the panel and we're going to be at the exit of the panel when it exits.

533
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:04,750
Rym: Yeah, so if you want to have an official meetup and hang out with cool GeekNights listeners and fans and friends, that is the time to find us to figure out the rest of Monday at PAX.

534
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:05,310
Scott: Yup.

535
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:07,895
Rym: Uh, yeah.

536
00:31:08,036 --> 00:31:08,599
Rym: So we'll be there.

537
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,423
Rym: I'll be at PAX Dev.

538
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:10,970
Rym: If you're at PAX Dev, totally let me know.

539
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:15,190
Rym: Maybe we can hang out and talk about it because we can't talk about it with anyone else.

540
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:28,170
Rym: So we have been fans for a very long time of James Rolfe, also known as the Angry Nintendo Nerd, later renamed due to copyright issues, the Angry Video Game Nerd.

541
00:31:28,851 --> 00:31:33,310
Scott: He is a person who is very similar to us in age and culture.

542
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,830
Rym: Well, culture as it relates to console video games.

543
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:39,774
Scott: Yes.

544
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:45,530
Scott: And he enjoys many of the same works that we enjoy and he produces video content that we enjoy.

545
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,088
Scott: And that's all there is to it.

546
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:48,910
Rym: Yup.

547
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:55,790
Rym: He's not like a lot of the other people on this level in the sense that he doesn't go to a lot of conventions when he does.

548
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,649
Rym: He doesn't really do much or say much.

549
00:31:57,911 --> 00:31:59,294
Rym: He's pretty narrowly focused.

550
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:04,990
Rym: Not that often you see him, other than on YouTube, but he made a movie.

551
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:05,920
Scott: He did.

552
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:10,450
Scott: He made a movie about... And he actually finished the movie, made it, and put it in theaters for reals.

553
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,370
Rym: Yes, and we went and saw it in a real theater in New York City.

554
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,850
Scott: We had an opportunity to see it in New York City, just had to buy tickets, so I did.

555
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:22,910
Scott: And it's going to be screened at PAX, by the way, but I don't have to waste my PAX time on that because I saw it already.

556
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:27,890
Rym: I need at least one of you to go to the screening because at the end of this episode, I have a question for you.

557
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:29,898
Rym: But the question is a spoiler.

558
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:32,430
Rym: Not for the movie, but for something else.

559
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:32,847
Rym: Okay.

560
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,532
Rym: But, yeah.

561
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:38,441
Rym: So, we're not going to spoil it because you should see it.

562
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:42,090
Rym: If you're a fan of him at all, it's actually really worth watching.

563
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:42,911
Scott: Right.

564
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:46,250
Scott: I mean, this is not fucking Citizen Kane, obviously.

565
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,958
Scott: But he knows how to make movies.

566
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:50,304
Scott: That's his thing, right?

567
00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:51,730
Scott: He's like his soul thing.

568
00:32:51,872 --> 00:32:52,770
Rym: He's a movie nerd.

569
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,632
Scott: He's a movie nerd.

570
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:56,199
Scott: So, did he do a good job?

571
00:32:56,219 --> 00:32:56,460
Scott: Yeah.

572
00:32:56,961 --> 00:33:00,190
Scott: I mean, it's pretty much exactly what I expected.

573
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:06,270
Scott: It's like an Angry Video Game Nerd episode, only longer, only bigger production value.

574
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,634
Rym: Surprisingly high quality.

575
00:33:08,674 --> 00:33:16,470
Rym: Like, the production values in terms of just shooting and lighting and all the technical stuff, I was really, actually, seriously impressed.

576
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,030
Scott: And it's almost two hours long, and it's not bad.

577
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:20,551
Rym: Yeah.

578
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:22,395
Rym: There's only a few things that drag.

579
00:33:22,415 --> 00:33:26,144
Rym: Like, there's an on-running joke with one of the girls toward the end.

580
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:28,750
Rym: that's just kind of a little overdone and a little bad.

581
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:37,510
Rym: But at the same time, there's other jokes that took me by such surprise that I laughed out loud and almost hurt myself because I didn't expect the movie to be that good.

582
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:37,810
Rym: Yeah.

583
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:40,157
Scott: It is not without flaw, right?

584
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:44,310
Scott: But it's the kind of movie where you're not going to be -- you will not regret going to see it.

585
00:33:44,951 --> 00:33:46,696
Scott: It's going to be available digitally pretty soon.

586
00:33:46,716 --> 00:33:49,746
Scott: If you are a fan of Angry Video Game Nerd, you will want to see this.

587
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:50,950
Scott: It's worth seeing.

588
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:59,570
Scott: Some of the things that I think I didn't like were, like, they had this running joke where they would use -- like, they would explode a toy.

589
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,180
Scott: Like, if a van was supposed to crash, they would have a toy van and crash it, and it would be shot in a way.

590
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,822
Scott: that's obvious.

591
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:09,889
Scott: it was a toy van and not the way Star Wars does it, where it's not obvious it's a toy.

592
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:11,810
Rym: I liked that when it kept happening.

593
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,022
Scott: Right, so it happened, like, once, and it's like, "Ah, I gotcha," right?

594
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,170
Scott: But then it happened, like, a bunch more times.

595
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:26,030
Rym: But every time it happened, because it was a different model, like, it got to the point where the colander and the missile thing, like, that was funny, even though it was the same gag again.

596
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,388
Rym: It also -- I had a colander like that.

597
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:32,330
Scott: The checkoff's gun was also really obvious, but that's okay.

598
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:32,846
Rym: Yup.

599
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:37,389
Scott: I still don't know -- even watching it, I don't know what the name of that big boss monster was.

600
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:39,101
Rym: Something.

601
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:40,670
Rym: Hell's garbage.

602
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:42,310
Scott: I can't even remember.

603
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:42,652
Rym: My brain can't.

604
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:44,250
Rym: My brain just thinks of it as word mash.

605
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:46,469
Scott: Yeah, the thing, the bad guy thing.

606
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,770
Rym: I like that bad guy thing, though.

607
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:48,070
Rym: Right.

608
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:55,942
Scott: But actually, I think, you know, it was funny, because everyone knows, if you know anything about it, right, the whole point of this movie is that he's going to review

609
00:34:56,022 --> 00:34:56,443
Scott: E.T.,

610
00:34:56,763 --> 00:35:02,690
Scott: which is the game he was never going to -- it's the unspeakable E.T So, you know, he saved it for the movie.

611
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:09,530
Rym: But his moral was literally identical to what we have been saying in our bad games lecture for a couple years.

612
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,594
Scott: Yeah, everything we have been saying about E.T.

613
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:13,718
Scott: for all this time is exactly what he said about

614
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:14,179
Scott: E.T.,

615
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,930
Scott: which is really interesting, because it's only sometimes that we say the exact same thing he says.

616
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:20,430
Rym: Yeah.

617
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,650
Rym: So, like, I was really surprised that that was the moral, that the game wasn't actually that bad, guys.

618
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:26,269
Rym: Seriously.

619
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,993
Scott: But, like, the movie has -- It's like GameStop culture.

620
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:36,179
Scott: It comments on, like, video game history.

621
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:40,110
Scott: It comments on -- like, he comments on his own fans and, like, you know, their culture.

622
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,877
Scott: It's like this movie, like, even though you could say the whole thing is a review of

623
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:45,418
Scott: E.T.,

624
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:53,710
Scott: it actually touches on, like, so many different things without, like, fucking up the pacing or anything like that or feeling, you know, too disjointed.

625
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,629
Scott: It's also -- I don't think a lot of people -- Like, he manages to fit everything in very nicely.

626
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:58,031
Rym: Yeah.

627
00:35:58,071 --> 00:36:01,225
Rym: Like, it could have been cut a little bit shorter, I think, but not that much.

628
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:02,390
Rym: Like, the editing was not bad.

629
00:36:03,071 --> 00:36:12,590
Rym: And there were a surprising number of very apt and very subtle film references that I don't think most of the people in the audience got.

630
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,850
Scott: Well, I think -- That's Terminator 2.

631
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,755
Rym: That's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3.

632
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:17,329
Rym: That's Vertigo.

633
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:24,370
Scott: Well, there are certain things that, you know, if you're just watching this and you don't know tons about film, you're going to miss.

634
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:37,605
Scott: But if you watch the videos on his site that are not Angry Video Game Nerd videos, if you're, like, a Cinemassacre fan and you've watched all of his content, all the Monster Madness and all his other stuff, then you're actually going to get a lot of that stuff.

635
00:36:37,685 --> 00:36:42,150
Scott: if you're observant, you know, because he's taught it to you in the past already.

636
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:45,709
Scott: So even if you're not a movie fan -- If you're a fan of him.

637
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,437
Scott: If you're a fan of him, he's sort of bled his enough movie fandom onto you.

638
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:56,410
Scott: There were quite a few things I noticed that I would not have noticed just based on my movie knowledge, but I noticed because I had watched a video that he did.

639
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,970
Rym: Specifically the reference to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3.

640
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,070
Rym: Yeah.

641
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,277
Rym: That was really good when that happened.

642
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:05,829
Rym: You'll know it when you see it, at least I hope you do.

643
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:13,250
Rym: The critical response was kind of eh, but I don't really expect -- I wonder how this movie goes over with someone who knows nothing about him at all.

644
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:14,011
Rym: Huh.

645
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:24,969
Rym: Hollywood Reporter called it, quote, "an overly long and obsessively self-indulgent work with production value that hovers above home video quality by a few admirable

646
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:25,490
Rym: notches.".

647
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:29,657
Scott: So I do agree that it was -- there was a lot of self-indulgence.

648
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:36,730
Scott: There were tons of stuff in there that was basically -- it wasn't self-indulgent as much as it was audience-pandering woo games.

649
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:37,329
Scott: Oh, my God.

650
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:38,629
Rym: Which bothers me a lot.

651
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,270
Scott: There was a section -- It bothers me a lot anywhere it appears, not just movies.

652
00:37:42,531 --> 00:37:50,530
Rym: This is where we got to talk a little bit about the experience of being in this theater, because that -- I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more had I watched it alone at home.

653
00:37:51,154 --> 00:37:51,829
Rym: Or with friends.

654
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,051
Rym: Yeah.

655
00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:53,553
Rym: Well, me.

656
00:37:53,654 --> 00:37:54,578
Rym: Maybe not you as much.

657
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:57,210
Rym: I was in a particularly difficult situation.

658
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,572
Rym: I will get to --.

659
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:10,110
Rym: so, whenever there was a joke that was obvious, like, people were not reacting heavily to most of the, like, more nuanced references.

660
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:15,562
Rym: But when, like, some -- the equivalent of someone getting hit in the nuts happens, the entire crowd would go,

661
00:38:15,662 --> 00:38:15,963
Rym: "Ha!"

662
00:38:16,684 --> 00:38:19,390
Rym: Like, one loud "ha" as loud as they could, and then clap and hoot.

663
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:26,050
Scott: Also, when there was lots and lots of cameos from other Internet videos, celebrity-type people.

664
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:27,477
Rym: And they were pretty well done.

665
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:30,090
Rym: Like, they were integrated, I think, the best way you could do that thing.

666
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,910
Scott: Sort of, but it's, like, you'd see, like, Doug Walker was on screen for, like, five seconds.

667
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:36,918
Rym: Oh, my -- so -- And the whole place exploded.

668
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:40,210
Scott: Just -- you didn't even -- it's, like, what he was doing wasn't even funny.

669
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,444
Rym: His bit was, like, 12 seconds long.

670
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:48,830
Scott: Just because he was on screen and he was Doug Walker, everyone in the place is, like, exploding, like, cheering and hollering and hooting.

671
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,053
Rym: Hollering and hooting.

672
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:51,718
Rym: The guy next to me just screeched.

673
00:38:51,939 --> 00:38:52,902
Rym: He just went, "Ah!

674
00:38:53,404 --> 00:38:53,524
Rym: Ah!

675
00:38:54,086 --> 00:38:54,226
Rym: Ah!".

676
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:55,350
Rym: I'm not even joking.

677
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,685
Rym: And then, like, that cameo was maybe 12 seconds long.

678
00:38:58,725 --> 00:38:59,830
Rym: The crowd goes apeshit.

679
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:09,190
Rym: They stand up and then give, like, a standing ovation to the point that you couldn't hear the dialogue of most of the next cameo.

680
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:11,509
Rym: Like, what the fuck, you kids?

681
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:18,089
Rym: They did the same thing for most of -- like, Keith Apicary had a cameo, and it was the same thing.

682
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:23,430
Scott: And just throughout the entire movie -- His cameo was actually probably one of the better ones.

683
00:39:23,512 --> 00:39:23,825
Scott: It was.

684
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:29,230
Scott: He just electrocuted himself, and it was satisfying to see him get harmed, even if it was fake harm.

685
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,330
Scott: He was almost Ernest-esque in his cameo.

686
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,290
Rym: So, this sold out, obviously.

687
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,750
Rym: And we met some friends, and we went over to this thing, and, you know, the movie was at, what, like, 7?

688
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,924
Rym: So, you guys got there, what, like, 45 minutes early?

689
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,837
Scott: Something like that, yeah.

690
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:47,230
Scott: I went to the Duane Reade, got a water.

691
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:55,550
Rym: It is obvious that at least the first 100 or so, maybe 200 people in line had been there for four-plus hours.

692
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,127
Scott: Yeah, but I noticed -- like, I saw how many people were in line in front of us, which is maybe 100 at most.

693
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:05,842
Scott: And I checked the capacity of the place on the Internet, and I was like, "Oh, we're good.

694
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,489
Scott: We can go even farther back in line.

695
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:08,730
Scott: We'll be

696
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:08,850
Scott: fine.".

697
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,414
Rym: But, like, it was a sold-out show.

698
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:16,050
Rym: Everyone had guaranteed tickets, and yet these people had been lined up, possibly all day, I get the impression.

699
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,281
Scott: Well, there was actually -- we were at the second showing.

700
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:20,190
Scott: Well, we were at the first showing that was offered.

701
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,598
Scott: They added a second showing, and the first one sold out.

702
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:25,690
Scott: That actually aired -- was before the one we saw.

703
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:31,630
Scott: So, like, people had gone in, and other people were waiting outside while there were other people inside were watching.

704
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,448
Scott: Those people left, and then we went in.

705
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:39,468
Rym: Also, I ended up having an extra ticket, and what was interesting is that I tweeted, like, "Hey, I got this extra

706
00:40:39,508 --> 00:40:39,749
Rym: ticket.".

707
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:44,081
Rym: The people who responded to that were frightening.

708
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:47,350
Rym: They really fucking wanted that ticket.

709
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:54,649
Rym: But, luckily, one guy who seemed pretty cool was -- and he had Simon Belmont from Captain N. Avatar -- There you go.

710
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,840
Rym: - was like, "Hey, can I have

711
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:55,900
Rym: it?".

712
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,324
Rym: And I was like,

713
00:40:56,344 --> 00:40:56,505
Rym: "Yeah.".

714
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,955
Rym: But then he didn't show up in time.

715
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:00,941
Rym: I told him to be there by 6.40.

716
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:01,462
Rym: He wasn't.

717
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,505
Rym: They let the line in.

718
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,110
Rym: I didn't see his Chimchar.

719
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,856
Rym: That's how he told me I'd find him.

720
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:07,444
Rym: He was like, "Yo, I'll have a Chimchar,".

721
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:08,730
Rym: and they sent me a link to a Chimchar.

722
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:10,050
Rym: Like, dude, I know what a Chimchar is.

723
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,069
Scott: You know what a Chimchar is.

724
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,570
Rym: Luckily, I don't feel too bad because -- It's a fire monkey.

725
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,918
Rym: After the movie, I saw on Twitter, he tweeted at me.

726
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:16,782
Rym: He's like, "Hey, I got in.

727
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:16,922
Rym: No

728
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:17,344
Rym: worries.".

729
00:41:17,404 --> 00:41:18,910
Rym: So, at least he got to see it.

730
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:19,508
Scott: Oh, okay.

731
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,752
Rym: Yeah, so that worked.

732
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:31,750
Rym: But the people in the line, mostly, like, the vast majority were, like, 14 to 19-year-old fat white guys.

733
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:32,372
Scott: Mm-hmm.

734
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,363
Scott: I saw e-cigs.

735
00:41:34,846 --> 00:41:35,630
Scott: I saw fedoras.

736
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,213
Rym: Trilbys.

737
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:47,170
Rym: The Trilby e-cig pony shirts or AVGN shirt, you know, the equivalent of the guy wearing the T-shirt of the band at the concert that they're going to right now.

738
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,187
Scott: Yeah, AVGN cosplays were not numbered in the zeroes.

739
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:59,610
Rym: And I was walking up and down the line looking for Chimchar guy, and I started overhearing conversations with the people in line in front of us, the people who'd been there for a while.

740
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:03,586
Rym: Those conversations -- there's only one word I can use to describe those conversations.

741
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:04,208
Rym: That word is

742
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:04,650
Rym: "choice.".

743
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:13,170
Rym: There were these two guys who were talking about a video game, and I think they were talking about the Stanley Parable.

744
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:18,306
Rym: But neither one of them knew what the name of it was, and the one guy was explaining what the game is like.

745
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:19,349
Rym: he was an authority on it.

746
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:24,129
Rym: But he was making shit up, and obviously had never actually played it.

747
00:42:24,551 --> 00:42:28,350
Rym: And I hung around next to these guys just kind of listening to see where this conversation was going.

748
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,229
Scott: This is like elementary school when there was no internet and you could just make shit up.

749
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,249
Rym: Yeah, it's like that's what was going on in this line in front of us.

750
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:40,130
Rym: And then I walked to the back of the line, and yeah, that was a gigantic line wrapping around the block.

751
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:47,590
Rym: There were dudes walking up and down the line, like one guy had a petition to get them to review some game.

752
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:50,900
Rym: And then we go in.

753
00:42:51,323 --> 00:42:52,170
Rym: We go in to see the movie.

754
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,760
Scott: I think he wanted them to play Earthrealm Jim 3D.

755
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:57,090
Scott: That was the game he wanted reviewed.

756
00:42:57,391 --> 00:42:58,577
Rym: I like his reaction on stage.

757
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,622
Rym: He was like, "Uh,

758
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:00,869
Rym: okay.".

759
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:07,870
Rym: So they let the line in, and the people in the front just basically fucking run to sit in the front center.

760
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:12,050
Rym: So we just walk in casually, and we go in and we see there's a bunch of seats.

761
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:15,530
Rym: So we kind of go around to the far right side instead of coming down the left side.

762
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,929
Scott: We just sat down in pretty good seats.

763
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,072
Rym: Yep.

764
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:19,817
Rym: We start going in toward the center.

765
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,843
Rym: I held up our group before.

766
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:24,250
Rym: Two seats before the next person.

767
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:26,058
Scott: Well, you want to leave a two-seat gap.

768
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,530
Scott: Leaving a one-seat gap is jerky because it's a sold-out show.

769
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,089
Scott: Someone's going to be all alone there.

770
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,950
Scott: You leave a two-seat gap so a group of two can come in and fit in that slot.

771
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:43,490
Rym: However, my real rationale was due to the size and enthusiasm of the gentleman who was sitting there, really wanted to be two seats away.

772
00:43:44,591 --> 00:43:55,888
Rym: So we're sitting there fine, and then this other group of people who were slow-moving but had been pretty far ahead of us in line come around, and they asked the end of our group, "Hey, we're a group of four,".

773
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,389
Rym: because there were two empty seats on either side of our group.

774
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:01,146
Rym: And they were like, "Can you guys scoot over so we can fit our group of four

775
00:44:01,227 --> 00:44:01,267
Rym: in?".

776
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:03,382
Rym: And Scott and everyone's like, "All right.

777
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:03,926
Rym: Whatever.

778
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:04,167
Rym: Cool.".

779
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:06,301
Rym: I'm looking at everyone like, "Please no.

780
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:07,066
Rym: Please

781
00:44:07,086 --> 00:44:07,408
Rym: no.".

782
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:09,290
Rym: But I'm not going to be that asshole.

783
00:44:09,852 --> 00:44:11,690
Rym: So we start to scoot over toward the middle.

784
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,640
Rym: Then the guy's like, "Oh, no.

785
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,246
Rym: We wanted you to scoot toward the end.

786
00:44:16,366 --> 00:44:17,009
Rym: We want to sit in the

787
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:17,230
Rym: middle.".

788
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:18,584
Scott: And I'm like, "Go fuck

789
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:18,969
Scott: yourself.".

790
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:20,519
Rym: What did you say exactly?

791
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:21,224
Rym: You said, "What?

792
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:22,109
Rym: No.".

793
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:23,769
Rym: And then we just sat back down.

794
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:24,727
Scott: What's wrong with you?

795
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:32,197
Rym: So for the next 20 minutes, this group of people, that guy keeps talking loudly to his friends like, "We saw those seats first.

796
00:44:32,238 --> 00:44:33,081
Rym: They weren't using them.

797
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:34,768
Rym: We got here in line before

798
00:44:34,808 --> 00:44:34,969
Rym: them.".

799
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:38,710
Rym: And I think he was mad and stewing about that for the entire movie.

800
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:48,394
Scott: I should just go to the Major League Baseball Stadium, and I'll buy nosebleed seats, and then I'll just go down to the behind-the-home plate and be like, "Okay.

801
00:44:48,876 --> 00:44:51,888
Scott: Can you guys move up to the upper deck so I can have these

802
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:52,190
Scott: seats?".

803
00:44:53,111 --> 00:44:53,395
Scott: "Cool.

804
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:54,043
Rym: Thanks, bro.

805
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:54,549
Rym: Yeah.".

806
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:54,844
Rym: Yup.

807
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,747
Scott: They'll be like, "Usher, how did this guy get

808
00:44:58,767 --> 00:44:58,888
Scott: here?".

809
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:08,130
Rym: So the guy next to me was oozed into my seat to the point that he was bodily leaning on me the entire time, and I kept sliding closer and closer to Scott, but I couldn't get away from him because the more--

810
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,446
Scott: And you kept elbowing my arm off the

811
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:09,750
Rym: armrest.

812
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,350
Rym: Yeah, because the more I moved away from him, the more he came into my seat.

813
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:19,349
Rym: And I thought maybe the passive-regressive model of not moving and letting him feel like, "Oh, I bumped into someone,".

814
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:24,349
Rym: either he did not feel me or he gave no shits because he just oozed over me.

815
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:26,575
Scott: The blob.

816
00:45:26,716 --> 00:45:27,946
Scott: People are fans of James Rolfe.

817
00:45:27,966 --> 00:45:28,510
Scott: We like the blob.

818
00:45:29,152 --> 00:45:38,849
Rym: And I feel bad kind of calling this guy out, but every time something funny happened in the movie, he'd pump his arm and scream and kick me.

819
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:49,150
Scott: Right, so we are not, me even less so than others, are not outwardly enthusiastic about things.

820
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,977
Scott: We will clap politely.

821
00:45:50,997 --> 00:45:53,027
Scott: We rarely cheer and scream and get crazy.

822
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,688
Rym: And even when I cheer, there are things that weren't--.

823
00:45:56,111 --> 00:45:59,446
Rym: For example, at a hockey game, I will jump up out of my seat and go, "Fuck

824
00:45:59,487 --> 00:45:59,908
Rym: yes!".

825
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:00,337
Scott: Yeah.

826
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,107
Scott: But I won't do that-- It can happen.

827
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:08,270
Rym: I won't do that every time a minor joke happens in a two-hour movie.

828
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:08,808
Scott: Yes.

829
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:10,730
Rym: Every single time.

830
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:20,850
Scott: But this entire crowd, other than a few people, us included, was-- When James Rolfe came out at the end-- Basically, they celebrated like their team won the World Cup.

831
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,429
Rym: With every dick joke.

832
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,348
Scott: At every single thing.

833
00:46:25,513 --> 00:46:30,890
Rym: And there was a point at the end where-- Every reference, every day, every everything.

834
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,464
Scott: All you had to do was stay up there and basically go like,

835
00:46:34,149 --> 00:46:34,289
Scott: "Ass!"

836
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,360
Scott: And people would have gone like,

837
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:35,623
Scott: "Whoo!".

838
00:46:36,491 --> 00:46:39,658
Rym: That actually pretty much directly happened during the Q&A, because James Rolfe was there.

839
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:40,649
Rym: They did a Q&A at the end.

840
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:54,910
Rym: And other than the fact that I missed a lot of dialogue from the movie because of the people screaming at every little joke, but the Q&A, when he came out on stage, the entire crowd stood up, and that was when we realized that to this crowd, he is their Jesus.

841
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:55,790
Scott: Pretty much.

842
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,576
Rym: And we looked around.

843
00:46:57,637 --> 00:46:59,025
Rym: First, we all look at each other like,

844
00:46:59,206 --> 00:46:59,488
Rym: "What?"

845
00:47:00,011 --> 00:47:05,990
Rym: And then we look out in the crowd, and there are about 10 or 11 other people who we all kind of met eyes, sitting down.

846
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:06,637
Scott: We're all sitting.

847
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,730
Scott: We're the only people sitting.

848
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,819
Rym: And we all look at each other like,

849
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:09,445
Rym: "Wow.".

850
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:17,490
Rym: And what followed was one of the saddest and most uncomfortable Q&A sessions I have ever witnessed.

851
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:24,385
Scott: Well, we counted who broke Scott's rules with Q&A, and to be fair, people asked legit questions that were interesting.

852
00:47:24,486 --> 00:47:25,070
Scott: There were a few.

853
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:27,150
Rym: Yeah, not the first several, though.

854
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:33,390
Scott: There were definitely questions that did not break the rules and were good questions, and I was actually interested to hear the answers, and they were good answers.

855
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:39,847
Scott: But for the first thing, we had a streak going of not -- everyone was breaking the rules of Scott's Q&A.

856
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:42,826
Rym: One guy right away was like, "Can I get your autograph right

857
00:47:42,887 --> 00:47:43,108
Rym: now?".

858
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:47,441
Rym: One guy was like, "I have a petition I want to deliver to you, blah, blah, blah, about the earthworms

859
00:47:47,482 --> 00:47:47,746
Rym: thing.".

860
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:55,767
Rym: And even then, I love these guys, but they don't really know how to work a crowd, so they didn't really repeat the questions.

861
00:47:55,788 --> 00:47:56,010
Rym: very well.

862
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:57,740
Scott: No, they make movies.

863
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,610
Scott: They don't have stage skills.

864
00:47:59,971 --> 00:48:01,150
Scott: When have they ever appeared on a stage?

865
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,687
Rym: The way it went was eventually you'd just hear "mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble,

866
00:48:03,707 --> 00:48:03,949
Rym: mumble.".

867
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:07,010
Rym: Oh, yes, that was in fact a reference.

868
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,250
Rym: You'd hear "mumble, mumble" and then an answer to a question you didn't hear.

869
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:18,589
Rym: And the crowd would react to pretty much everything you said, and we realized after a while that this was going to go on for another hour.

870
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:20,889
Scott: I was going to go on until they stopped it.

871
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,289
Rym: Yeah, it was going to go for a while.

872
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,270
Scott: And there was really no value to be had from staying there.

873
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,910
Rym: Yeah, a lot of the questions could have been answered by Google.

874
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:29,449
Scott: Yes.

875
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,424
Rym: So we look at each other and we're like, "Bail?

876
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:31,889
Rym: Bail.".

877
00:48:32,131 --> 00:48:33,309
Rym: So we get up and we go to leave.

878
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:36,830
Rym: We could not go to the left because of the excitable gentleman.

879
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,570
Scott: And it was farther to go to the left anyway.

880
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:46,218
Rym: Yeah, so we turn to the right to leave, and the guy, that group, the people that were mad at us, that guy looks at us and he's like, "What?

881
00:48:46,681 --> 00:48:47,766
Rym: What do you mean you want to leave?

882
00:48:47,826 --> 00:48:48,147
Rym: It's not

883
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:48,449
Rym: over.".

884
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:59,370
Rym: He was so visibly and viscerally offended that we were going to leave during the Q&A that they refused to get out of our way.

885
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,248
Rym: They refused to move.

886
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,423
Rym: He literally, they're like, "Well,

887
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:02,908
Rym: bleh.".

888
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:09,030
Rym: And they sat there, stopped looking at us, they faced forward, planted their feet, and refused to move their entire party.

889
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:11,669
Rym: So we just stepped over them and left.

890
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,350
Rym: It was amazing.

891
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:17,310
Rym: I've never seen, I've never experienced something like that before.

892
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,304
Rym: What's your life like that?

893
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:20,989
Rym: this is what you do?

894
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:24,090
Scott: Rewatching AVGN episodes every ten times a day?

895
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:35,690
Rym: Yeah, oh, and during the Q&A, I think the most interesting part was that they didn't really have a process for it, so people would just raise their hands.

896
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:40,530
Rym: I would say 80% of the crowd was Milhousing it the entire time.

897
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,730
Rym: Like jumping up and down, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

898
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:51,469
Rym: The excitable gentleman next to me, large excitable, maximal in both those areas, elbowed me in the head like nine times.

899
00:49:52,813 --> 00:49:54,330
Rym: He just kept waving his arm around.

900
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:57,070
Rym: Eventually, I just started ducking under him every time.

901
00:49:57,534 --> 00:49:58,830
Rym: It was time to ask more questions.

902
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,290
Rym: And then there was a moment where there's too many sad stories.

903
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,547
Rym: I just won't even tell the rest of them.

904
00:50:04,892 --> 00:50:06,289
Rym: You can imagine what this was like.

905
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:11,490
Rym: So my task to you, tell us if it's like that at the PAX screening or not.

906
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:12,569
Scott: Tell us if it's like that.

907
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,709
Scott: If you went to any of the other screenings in any of the other states, tell us how it was like.

908
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:21,030
Scott: And also, you know, this movie is going to come out digitally.

909
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:23,070
Scott: It's worth watching.

910
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,490
Rym: It is absolutely worth watching.

911
00:50:25,753 --> 00:50:27,369
Scott: I'll watch it once again even.

912
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:28,690
Rym: There's a joke in the beginning.

913
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:33,830
Scott: I'll watch it once again with people who haven't seen it and it will be a worthwhile expenditure of two hours.

914
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:45,729
Scott: Whoever it was who played the manager of that GameStop, it looks like it's going to be a-- That's one of those pot of gold, guy who can't get work, amazing actors who does one thing that they found in Hollywood when they were there.

915
00:50:45,852 --> 00:50:46,288
Rym: That guy.

916
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:47,107
Rym: Doing casting.

917
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:52,550
Rym: Like he was average funny and then he took it up to maximum.

918
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:56,749
Scott: I think if you go in Hollywood, there's all these desperate actors everywhere working nothing, right?

919
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:02,010
Scott: But a lot of them have some kind of talent that just isn't like a movie for them or, you know, whatever.

920
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:04,550
Scott: But if you go there, you can find these people.

921
00:51:04,952 --> 00:51:07,649
Scott: And it's like I kind of just wish I had enough money to go there.

922
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:08,690
Rym: Get all those people.

923
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:14,189
Scott: Maybe not even make a movie, but just make something with a bunch of those people like that all together, right?

924
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:21,690
Scott: Like those talented-- Because people have like a hidden amazing talent at like a certain kind of character or something, you know, where like their performance really stands out.

925
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,070
Scott: The one I always think of, right, is when I went to see Les Mis.

926
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:28,950
Scott: like in the '90s, the master of the house is just like this incredible dude.

927
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:29,390
Scott: Yep.

928
00:51:30,112 --> 00:51:33,530
Scott: Was it like an all-time fucking greatest actor or anything?

929
00:51:34,095 --> 00:51:34,669
Scott: Probably not.

930
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:42,290
Scott: But it's like dude got more applause than anyone else at the end because he was just so good at that thing right there, being that person.

931
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:46,150
Rym: If you're the right kind of person, that's not a role.

932
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,569
Rym: There are just people who are kind of like that.

933
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:49,890
Scott: Right, obviously the role does part of the work as well, right?

934
00:51:50,771 --> 00:51:52,930
Scott: You know, you need to get both things combined.

935
00:51:53,390 --> 00:52:06,730
Scott: Like imagine if you went to see a show of some kind, play TV show, movie, whatever, and everyone in the whole thing was fucking like that ace character, you know, all across the board, you know?

936
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:13,950
Scott: And even in things like, you know, Fullmetal Alchemist, like the Hughes character, it's just like the guy who's the best.

937
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:14,530
Scott: Yeah.

938
00:52:15,652 --> 00:52:18,210
Rym: So in the end, this movie definitely worth seeing.

939
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:21,470
Rym: I went into it with what I thought were like reasonable expectations.

940
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:25,949
Rym: This movie actually far exceeded them and was like really worth watching.

941
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,510
Scott: I think it just matched my expectation precisely.

942
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,741
Rym: I expected less and I got more.

943
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:32,230
Rym: I'm actually really happy about that.

944
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,585
Scott: Wow, you expected less than me.

945
00:52:33,605 --> 00:52:33,990
Scott: That's rare.

946
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:35,038
Rym: Yeah, it is rare.

947
00:52:35,058 --> 00:52:36,010
Rym: I don't know why.

948
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:39,009
Rym: Maybe just I've been jaded recently by stuff.

949
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:42,549
Rym: Apparently used a Panasonic AGAF100 camera for a lot of this.

950
00:52:44,993 --> 00:52:47,070
Rym: Wikipedia has a lot of info on the movie already.

951
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,669
Scott: That was the camera they were using on the stage.

952
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,269
Rym: And also has a notability warning on it.

953
00:52:52,816 --> 00:52:53,670
Scott: I think it's notable.

954
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:56,570
Rym: Nope, this article relies on all primary sources.

955
00:52:57,172 --> 00:53:01,750
Rym: There are no references yet except James Rolfe himself about this movie.

956
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:02,390
Rym: That's why.

957
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,170
Scott: Let's do Wikipedia policy.

958
00:53:05,872 --> 00:53:06,943
Scott: Someone's reviewed the movie.

959
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:07,650
Scott: That's got to be enough.

960
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:09,047
Scott: IMDb page, come on.

961
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:14,610
Rym: Seriously, according to Wikipedia, the budget was around three or four hundred thousand dollars.

962
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:15,181
Scott: Yeah.

963
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:24,446
Rym: That, if this is the kind of movie that four hundred grand makes, we are in for a like platinum age of cinema in about ten years.

964
00:53:24,466 --> 00:53:25,149
Rym: Seriously.

965
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:30,909
Scott: Yeah, because in ten years you could take three or four hundred grand and make something even better than this.

966
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,390
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

967
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:43,530
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

968
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:48,950
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

969
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,870
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.

970
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:56,630
Rym: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

971
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:00,146
Scott: GeekNights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

972
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:04,430
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

973
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,570
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
