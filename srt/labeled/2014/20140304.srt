1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,448
Rym: It's Tuesday, March 4th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,448 --> 00:00:10,749
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:14,280
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,965
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:19,960
Rym: Tonight, the phases of games and why the beginning and the end don't matter.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,610
Rym: Maybe the middle doesn't matter.

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,900
Rym: Nothing matters.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,338
Scott: Let's do this.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,460
Rym: So I know we said no more hiatus for GeekNights, but unfortunately I got sick last week so we missed a show.

10
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:37,260
Rym: And I'm going to be in Europe starting tomorrow morning.

11
00:00:37,742 --> 00:00:41,860
Scott: If you're in Europe in one of the cities where Rym is going to, why don't you meet him?

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,780
Rym: Yeah, follow me on Twitter, but basically this Saturday I'll be in London pretty much all day with fuck all to do.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,559
Rym: I'm not flying to Mumbai until late that night.

14
00:00:51,541 --> 00:01:00,859
Rym: So if you want to meet at like a pub in London, somewhere relatively downtown in the afternoon, grab a pint, fish and chips, whatever you people do.

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,539
Scott: Bring me back some Crown Jewels.

16
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,260
Rym: I don't have enough time to organize some sort of Lupin-style heist.

17
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:07,499
Scott: Well, the person who's there probably has it already set up.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,379
Rym: I might get some sort of Locke Lamora-style heist, but you won't like the results of that.

19
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:17,380
Rym: And yeah, I'll be in Mumbai the next day if anyone happens to be hanging out in Mumbai.

20
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:22,100
Rym: And my Abu Dhabi part is only a extended layover.

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,900
Rym: I don't know if I'll bother leaving the airport because I kind of have time to leave the airport.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,779
Scott: If you work in the Abu Dhabi airport.

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,140
Rym: What's funny is I go to the Abu Dhabi airport website and it's like, how long is your transfer?

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,159
Scott: It's a serious airport, right?

25
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:35,898
Rym: Yeah, it is.

26
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:37,640
Rym: And they're like, how long is your transfer?

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,760
Rym: And basically they're like, based on how long your transfer is, they tell you what you can do.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,620
Rym: And they're like, if you have three to five hours, here's a golf course.

29
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:45,459
Rym: We'll take you there.

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,279
Scott: Three to five hours.

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,260
Scott: We have a spa built into the airport.

32
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,740
Rym: Well, I was at an airport years ago where there were these pods just in the terminals.

33
00:01:54,302 --> 00:01:56,379
Rym: And basically what you could do, there were big pods.

34
00:01:56,841 --> 00:02:02,880
Rym: You walk up to it and if it's not in use, you swipe your credit card and it's a hotel room in the terminal.

35
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:05,199
Rym: You just walk in, lock the door, you've got a hotel room.

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,280
Rym: You pay for it in like four hour blocks.

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,779
Scott: When you leave it, who cleans it?

38
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:12,720
Rym: When you leave it, I guess it's locked out until the maids come and then it opens up again.

39
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,439
Rym: So it's basically a hotel.

40
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,280
Rym: So if you have like a five hour layover, you can just check into a hotel room with your credit card.

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,740
Rym: It's kind of cool.

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,939
Scott: Set your alarm for four hours.

43
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,393
Rym: Yeah.

44
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:22,538
Rym: Think about that.

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,900
Rym: Literally wake up and just go to your play.

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,820
Scott: Does the pod have a TV?

47
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:26,958
Rym: I assume so.

48
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,879
Rym: I've never used one of these things.

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,760
Scott: Does it vibrate?

50
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:35,059
Rym: I've not seen a vibrating bed since the Chai Lai Motor Inn.

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,639
Rym: You remember those days.

52
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,878
Scott: That one day, yes.

53
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,273
Rym: Yeah.

54
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:45,380
Rym: Those days when we'd stay in cheap hotels and, well, motels and weird places for weird reasons.

55
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,879
Rym: I haven't done that in a while.

56
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,399
Scott: We can afford not to.

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,860
Rym: Well, we never travel far enough to where we need to stay en route to somewhere else.

58
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:55,500
Rym: And we don't go to cons where there isn't a hotel nearby.

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,720
Scott: Let's bike in one direction for a whole day until we get to a motel when the sun goes down.

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,659
Rym: You know, long distance bike trips might be when we start hitting motels again.

61
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:04,540
Scott: Anyway.

62
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,460
Rym: So, yeah, no GeekNights the rest of the week, but I'll be back in the States.

63
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:18,540
Scott: If you want to be entertained on the internet in other ways, I will do my not necessarily best, but I'll put some forth the token effort.

64
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,620
Scott: And if you stay tuned to the meta moment, maybe you'll learn about that token effort.

65
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:23,879
Rym: Ah, token efforts.

66
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,598
Rym: I like tokens.

67
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:26,048
Scott: Meh.

68
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,120
Rym: So, in the news, I got a Geek Byte.

69
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,540
Rym: I've been playing Civ V a lot lately.

70
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,700
Scott: We've talked about Civ enough on this show.

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,740
Scott: What more could there possibly be to say that has not been said?

72
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:49,240
Rym: Alright, well, the one thing I want to point out is that I was playing it again partly because I've been playing it multiplayer and I'm testing all the bits and getting, you know, there's this learning curve to Civ until you sort of naturally know everything.

73
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:54,266
Rym: Like, every time you play through the game once, there's one more complicated, deeper bit.

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,458
Scott: What does that wonder do?

75
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,600
Rym: Well, no, like that you ignore.

76
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:59,920
Rym: Like, I'm going to ignore the tourism thing.

77
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:02,940
Scott: Oh, I can buy things using the faith points.

78
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,640
Rym: Or theming bonus with the tourism stuff.

79
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,399
Rym: What's that?

80
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,320
Rym: I'll just let that be automatic this time.

81
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,959
Rym: And the next time you're like, I should look at what that does.

82
00:04:12,663 --> 00:04:13,678
Rym: So, I've been doing that.

83
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:20,260
Rym: I was playing a game the other day and I was going for the Culture Victory, which is significantly different under the new expansions.

84
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,419
Scott: I like the way Culture Victory worked in Civ III.

85
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,119
Scott: It was easy.

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,538
Rym: Yeah, it was also boring.

87
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:26,119
Rym: Civ V is great.

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,479
Rym: Basically, if your tourism output is greater than their culture output, you start becoming more and more influential over them.

89
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:36,100
Rym: And then if you conquer their cities, the people are like, OK, dog, whatever, it's cool.

90
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:38,859
Rym: Or, eventually, they just let you in.

91
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,900
Rym: So, you can defend against that by having more culture yourself.

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,260
Rym: So, I went for the Culture Victory and it was just taking too long.

93
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:55,980
Rym: And it so happens that when I'm in a position to get the Culture Victory, I'm also in a position to get Diplomatic Victory and Domination Victory.

94
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,505
Scott: Yeah, I noticed that happens in Civ in general, that all the victory conditions overlap a lot.

95
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,939
Scott: So, it's like, if you're going to get one, it's sort of like you can choose whichever one you want.

96
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:05,559
Rym: Well, it's interesting.

97
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,760
Rym: What I found is that my style of play goes toward an extreme economy, which basically makes all the other ones trivial.

98
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,296
Rym: But, if I go for Culture from the beginning, really Culture is the only one I can go for by the end.

99
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,620
Rym: Like, I won't have the military capability to go for Domination.

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,154
Rym: So, just my play style.

101
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,338
Rym: But anyway, it was taking too long and I was like, "Fuck

102
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:26,458
Rym: it!".

103
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,439
Rym: So, I just invaded the civilization, the last one that had their capital, to just take it and win the game right away, because my military was just so big.

104
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,679
Rym: And, I took their capital and I didn't win.

105
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:39,188
Rym: So, I'm like,

106
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:39,432
Rym: "What?".

107
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:47,439
Rym: So, I go into the Civipedia and it says, "Yeah, if you're the last civilization who has your original capital, you win a Domination

108
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:47,640
Rym: Victory.".

109
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:53,380
Rym: It turns out, they changed that in the expansion and didn't update the Civillipedia.

110
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:59,596
Rym: So, I go on Google and I'm like, "Yo, Civ V

111
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:00,358
Rym: Domination.".

112
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:02,440
Rym: And, the first result is like broken.

113
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,580
Rym: Here's the explanation.

114
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,640
Rym: So, it's no longer having the only, basically the only person left who has your original capital.

115
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:14,140
Rym: You have to have all of the original capitals.

116
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:22,160
Rym: So, I went and reconquered the capital that I had previously liberated back to good old George Washington and then I immediately won.

117
00:06:24,353 --> 00:06:25,540
Rym: So, yeah, watch out for the Civillipedia.

118
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,012
Rym: They have not kept it 100% accurate.

119
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,105
Scott: Documentation?

120
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:30,174
Scott: Out of date?

121
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:30,840
Scott: What?

122
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:41,780
Rym: Hey, Civ games have had better documentation throughout their entire history than any other game or software I have ever played or used in my entire life.

123
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,078
Scott: Civ 2 came with a fucking tome.

124
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Rym: I know, that book was like three quarters of an inch thick and I never owned it in my life because I pirated the game.

125
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:49,053
Scott: I have it.

126
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:54,460
Rym: But, it also had the Civillipedia stuff and the help and it was awesome.

127
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,320
Rym: So, yeah, that's my tale of woe.

128
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,420
Scott: I bet it takes longer to make the Civillipedia than it takes to code the stupid game.

129
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,016
Rym: No, easily.

130
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,020
Rym: Documentation is the least served and also probably actually least important part of software design, to be perfectly honest.

131
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,810
Scott: Imagine if someone, the guy whose job it is to make the Civillipedia, he's like, "No one will ever look at this.

132
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,038
Scott: Oh, I hate my

133
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,280
Scott: life.".

134
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,198
Rym: Yeah, but Civ people seem to always look at it because they obsess over the minutia of.

135
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,440
Scott: I rarely look at the Civillipedia.

136
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,099
Rym: Scott, do you build a second city in your first 50 turns?

137
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,694
Scott: In the first 50 turns?

138
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:28,439
Scott: Depends on who I am.

139
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,619
Scott: Not if I'm Ghandi.

140
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,200
Rym: Yes, you can probably figure that out from looking at the Civillipedia if you should.

141
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,319
Scott: Not if I'm Ghandi.

142
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:35,938
Rym: Anyway, so you got any news?

143
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:38,137
Scott: Sort of.

144
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:42,420
Scott: It's not a big news, but in some ways it's an insignificant news.

145
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:45,200
Scott: A remake of a game is going to be released.

146
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,980
Scott: Big deal, right?

147
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,200
Scott: Not something the big talk about.

148
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,420
Scott: The game is Jungle Speed.

149
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,960
Scott: A game we have talked about quite often on this show.

150
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,780
Scott: Nothing special.

151
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,660
Scott: They're going to make a 20th anniversary edition.

152
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:54,900
Scott: 20?

153
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,022
Rym: Fuck!

154
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:56,649
Scott: Right.

155
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,960
Scott: It's just Jungle Speed re-release.

156
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,118
Scott: Why is this a big deal?

157
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,420
Scott: Wooden totem.

158
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:02,278
Rym: Great.

159
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,660
Scott: Return of the wooden totem.

160
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,820
Rym: So now, not only...

161
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,879
Scott: I'm going to buy like three of them.

162
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,478
Rym: Yeah, not only can I play...

163
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:09,220
Scott: I'm seriously not even joking.

164
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,077
Scott: I'm going to buy at least two.

165
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:22,820
Rym: So not only can I play the original, proper Jungle Speed with a proper edition, because actually lately a big problem is that all the expansions and things were all printed by different people at different times and Amazon entries all suck.

166
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:27,100
Scott: I'm missing a Jungle Speed card and I have the expansion Jungle Speed Extreme.

167
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:27,758
Scott: The good expansion.

168
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,380
Scott: And the backs of the Jungle Speed Extreme do not match the current printings of Jungle Speed.

169
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,539
Scott: So I can't mix the incomplete set I have.

170
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,679
Rym: But Jungle Speed without Extreme has kind of played out for me at this point.

171
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,919
Scott: Not if it has a wooden totem.

172
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:50,180
Rym: Yeah, so now not only can I play Jungle Speed again in a canonical format, but I can actually break my finger instead of just breaking the fingernail off of my finger.

173
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,138
Scott: The way it was meant to be.

174
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:55,700
Rym: Maybe we should just go all out and get Turbo to make us one of those stainless steel totems.

175
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,840
Scott: Let's not get a stainless steel totem.

176
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,340
Rym: There's polonium.

177
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,416
Rym: There's polonium up ins.

178
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,242
Scott: Uh...

179
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:00,808
Rym: Dolomite.

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,400
Scott: Plutonium.

181
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,296
Rym: Dolomite.

182
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:06,340
Scott: Unilenium totem.

183
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,919
Scott: You have to be really fast to grab it.

184
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,660
Rym: Seriously, we don't talk about these kinds of games, but Jungle Speed is a great game.

185
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:15,820
Rym: The problem is you can't make it your primary game.

186
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,640
Rym: That's the game you play when everyone meets up at a con for like an hour before you all split up into real games.

187
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,479
Rym: If you play Jungle Speed, all con.

188
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,639
Rym: One, you're breaking a finger.

189
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:26,059
Scott: Two...

190
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,220
Rym: Things of the day!

191
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:37,779
Rym: I can't really explain how I found this.

192
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,779
Rym: And it doesn't have a lot of views.

193
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,477
Rym: So I feel like, unlike my old days of "Here's a College Humor" video, I got something kind of obscure.

194
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:56,260
Rym: Someone took the animation from He-Man and overdubbed it and made a sketch about Skeletor having ADHD and it involves a baby.

195
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,727
Scott: Are you sure it wasn't like a sketch that was done somewhere else?

196
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:02,260
Scott: and then someone took the audio from that sketch and then matched up He-Man video?

197
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:10,220
Rym: I don't think so because the audio specifically references Skeletor, the baby, Princess Adora, the baby, we stole the baby.

198
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:10,700
Rym: Okay.

199
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:17,940
Rym: So if there's Princess Adora, the baby, and Skeletor and some other thing, then I kind of want to see whatever that thing is.

200
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:28,980
Rym: This is so close to what used to be the aesthetic of Space Ghost Coast to Coast that it made me really want to watch old Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

201
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,980
Scott: I'm sure there is a torrent all Space Ghost.

202
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,923
Rym: There probably is.

203
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:35,440
Rym: So if you like my thing of the day, do yourself a favor.

204
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,560
Scott: Maybe I'll get that torrent and spend the rest of my life just wasting on my couch.

205
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:43,579
Rym: The thing is there's not that much Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

206
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:45,750
Scott: There's a lot of it.

207
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:46,439
Scott: There's more than you'd think.

208
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,415
Rym: Well, do you also include like the Cartoon Planet stuff?

209
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:50,240
Rym: Like how deep do you go?

210
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,190
Scott: It doesn't add that many hours.

211
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:53,965
Rym: Yeah.

212
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:58,460
Rym: Well, it's trouble because those episodes are, in terms of mental hours, like four hours long each.

213
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,640
Rym: I think my favorite one is still the one where he just follows that ant for the entire episode.

214
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:08,840
Rym: Anyway, you got a thing of the day?

215
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,785
Scott: I do.

216
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:12,880
Scott: So this would normally be a Monday thing of the day, but that doesn't matter.

217
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,770
Scott: It's Tuesday and you're getting a Monday thing of the day.

218
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,120
Scott: You should learn some other geekery, gamer people.

219
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,340
Rym: I guess mine was a Wednesday thing of the day.

220
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:31,160
Scott: So if you have a computer and you have a list of numbers and you want to tell the computer to sort that list of numbers, nowadays you can just do sort, parenthesis, list, name, close parenthesis and it will happen.

221
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,499
Rym: And you don't care how it happens.

222
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,231
Scott: Right, but how is it happening?

223
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,500
Scott: How does a computer do that?

224
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,597
Scott: I mean, a human being, you can just look at, you know, if I give you the numbers one to ten on different pieces of paper, you can just put them in order, just eh.

225
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:44,079
Scott: But a computer can't do that.

226
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,227
Rym: No, even then, you're not just going eh.

227
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:49,260
Rym: You have some algorithm or process in your brain.

228
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,897
Scott: Yeah, but it's like you'll just find the one, put it first, find the two, put it second.

229
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:53,420
Scott: probably, right?

230
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,264
Scott: Computer can't do that.

231
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:59,840
Scott: Computer, you know, to sort an arbitrary list of numbers, computer needs some sort of algorithm.

232
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,460
Scott: The best algorithm on average is called the quicksort.

233
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:05,228
Scott: How does the quicksort work?

234
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,900
Scott: Watch these Hungarian folk dancers demonstrate.

235
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,998
Rym: This is pretty great.

236
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,780
Rym: So, in the meta moment, might not be GeekNights for a week or so and then we'll return.

237
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,719
Rym: Scott is going to produce some content on his own, it sounds like.

238
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,180
Scott: The content I will produce will probably be like some Netrunner videos.

239
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:21,959
Rym: Twitch stream.

240
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,340
Scott: I'm streaming Twitch, I'm still playing Pokemon LeafGreen, which is the best Pokemon.

241
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:28,604
Scott: Ah.

242
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,559
Scott: So you can go to my Twitch channel.

243
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:36,280
Rym: I gotta start doing my Twitch streams more often, now that we know how to not lose our videos.

244
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:42,377
Scott: I might be doing some other stuff, depending on discussions with other people, maybe.

245
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:43,742
Rym: Oh?

246
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:45,040
Rym: Something secret?

247
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:47,220
Scott: No, it's not really, it's just I don't know.

248
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,579
Rym: You don't want to shit talk it until it's real?

249
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,500
Scott: Ah, yeah, exactly, right.

250
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:53,060
Scott: And then, but I already made one, you know, the sample.

251
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:56,860
Scott: I don't know, just follow me in all the internet places.

252
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,579
Rym: Yeah, I mean, my YouTube channel is pretty much.

253
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,079
Scott: Twitter, Facebook, G+, YouTube, Twitch.

254
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,380
Rym: The GeekNights Rym YouTube channel is pretty much the official GeekNights channel in terms of like our panels, our lectures, stuff like that.

255
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,160
Rym: Scott's Twitch is pretty much the official GeekNights streaming channel.

256
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,760
Scott: And remember, I have my own YouTube, which is mostly Netrunner videos, but not entirely.

257
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,340
Rym: In the summer, it's also occasionally Scott biking somewhere.

258
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:23,760
Scott: We got a lot of different channels on the internet.

259
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,720
Scott: Our website, which maybe you could visit.

260
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,820
Scott: Our forum, you know, go to all those places.

261
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,800
Rym: Our forum is pretty badass lately.

262
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,899
Rym: You should really check it out.

263
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,260
Rym: It's not like other internet forums.

264
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,039
Scott: Go to all the places on the internet and follow us.

265
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,500
Scott: You know, Rym has some tumbles sometimes.

266
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,220
Rym: Yeah, I'm going to tumble again soon.

267
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:42,420
Rym: I got to queue up a bunch of tumbles and let them tumble on down.

268
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,540
Scott: We got like Flickr account, you know, we are the people who post things on the internet.

269
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:49,678
Scott: The shy people are like deleting all their accounts saying, "No, I'm not

270
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:49,980
Scott: posting.".

271
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,900
Scott: You know, so follow us and see things.

272
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,439
Scott: Get the whole experience.

273
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,120
Scott: Don't just listen to the stupid podcast.

274
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,900
Rym: And thankfully, because I'm very careful when I go through Flickr, you're not going to accidentally see our dicks.

275
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:01,814
Scott: Great.

276
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:08,400
Rym: So, there was a fascinating article recently.

277
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:09,779
Scott: What's the Book Club book?

278
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,540
Rym: Oh, the Book Club book is Wool, post-apocalyptic something.

279
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,638
Scott: Like the shit that sheep grow on them.

280
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:18,540
Rym: That's a way to describe wool, I guess.

281
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,159
Scott: And then you cut it off and make a sweater with.

282
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,318
Rym: But you shear it off.

283
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:22,478
Scott: Same thing.

284
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:23,818
Rym: No, it is subtly so.

285
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,760
Rym: If I think cut it off, I imagine using like a knife or scissors.

286
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,959
Rym: But shearing, I imagine using a shearing device of some kind.

287
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:31,957
Scott: Oh, whatevs.

288
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:46,559
Rym: So, there's a fascinating article about Civ 5, and though it really applies to all versions of Civ, and it asks a question where half the world said, "Duh," and the other half said, "Why would you do that?

289
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:47,915
Rym: Who would ever do

290
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:48,138
Rym: that?".

291
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:49,439
Rym: The question was simple.

292
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:59,300
Rym: Is there ever a case in a Civilization game where you should move your settler on the first turn, rather than immediately building your Civ?

293
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,760
Scott: Do you immediately press B, or do you move your settler first?

294
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:09,420
Scott: So, first of all, it depends on, you know, apparently, I didn't realize this, there's a mode in Civ with biased starting position.

295
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,440
Rym: Which is the best way to play.

296
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:16,899
Scott: It'll put your settler in an amazing spot to start with, in which case there's really no reason not to just push B.

297
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,060
Rym: And everyone else also starts in an amazing spot that's tuned to them, so it's fine.

298
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,260
Scott: It gives you the resources that like your Civ is better with and such.

299
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,431
Scott: So it's not like, "I'm the

300
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:26,058
Scott: Mongols."

301
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,240
Scott: If you're a boating guy, you'll be on the fucking coast.

302
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,338
Rym: You're not gonna be like, "I'm the Mongols, I never see a horse the entire

303
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:31,640
Rym: game.".

304
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,860
Scott: Right, there'll be a horse right fucking there, right?

305
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:40,520
Scott: So if you have that mode on, press B. If you don't have the mode on, right, then, well, you gotta sort of look around, right?

306
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,760
Scott: You can only see so far, so it's like you look at your spot and it's never gonna be a bad spot.

307
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,220
Scott: They never give you something awful to start with.

308
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,479
Rym: You're on one desert tile surrounded by ocean in every direction.

309
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,677
Scott: No, surrounded by mountains that cannot be traversed.

310
00:15:54,064 --> 00:15:54,700
Scott: Without flight.

311
00:15:56,422 --> 00:16:03,691
Scott: No, it's like, they'll start you in an okay spot, but it's like, if I spend a turn moving, right, am I gonna see a better spot?

312
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:04,900
Scott: Which direction do I go?

313
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,899
Scott: Assuming you're surrounded by land.

314
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,619
Rym: And this is new to Civ, I mean, in old Civ games, sometimes you start with two settlers, or a settler and a warrior, settler and a scout.

315
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:13,779
Scott: Oh, two settlers is so good.

316
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,519
Rym: Oh my god, two settlers was... In my Civ 2 strategy was pretty much...

317
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,300
Scott: Restart the game until you get two settlers?

318
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,720
Rym: Yep, and then build as many fucking cities as I can as fast as possible.

319
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,058
Rym: Because fuck you.

320
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,220
Rym: And that worked really great.

321
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,960
Scott: That was my strategy as well.

322
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,800
Rym: Of course, that was an error when I didn't really play Civ games against humans.

323
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:40,460
Rym: Because if someone tried that shit against me, my one horseman would just take all the cities and all the settlers.

324
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:44,820
Scott: Oh, is that a settler all in his own running to hurry up and build the city?

325
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,693
Scott: Alright, build it.

326
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:45,978
Scott: Yoink!

327
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,940
Scott: Nowadays the city defends itself, so you gotta grab the settler.

328
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:59,680
Rym: Now, the article is fascinating because it, one, brings up the schism that, think about this, a popular game, a popular game franchise, had a question, a simple strategic question.

329
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:03,760
Rym: You have a choice on your first turn, otherwise why wouldn't you just start with the city?

330
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:05,459
Rym: So there is a choice there.

331
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,720
Rym: Half of the people who played Civ never even considered that that choice mattered.

332
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,579
Rym: And the other half agonized over that choice.

333
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:22,190
Scott: Well, cause I mean, you're sitting there and you're thinking, if I wait an extra turn before building the city, I'm giving up, what, like, you know, two barrels, two grains, and a shield maybe?

334
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:22,855
Scott: Right?

335
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:23,680
Scott: Worth of production?

336
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,773
Rym: Yep, on turn 100, how much is that gonna matter?

337
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:26,660
Rym: Possibly a lot.

338
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Scott: Right, because that means I could've gotten, like, a temple a turn sooner, which means I could've gotten something else a turn sooner, and so on and so forth, and you imagine, wow, that adds up to a lot of resources.

339
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,420
Scott: But, what if I move to a better spot, right?

340
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,211
Scott: If I move and land somewhere that then has, say, a better resource, like, I don't know, a wheat.

341
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,939
Rym: Wheat's pretty good.

342
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:58,140
Scott: That's like an extra, okay, I lose the two food from this turn, but I'll get it back within two turns, and on the third turn, I'll be profiting with that one extra, you know, food barrel.

343
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:03,979
Rym: But, what if I move, and the terrain I see is actually not better, and I just fucked myself.

344
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,040
Scott: Then you just fucked yourself, because now you gotta spend a turn moving back.

345
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:07,446
Rym: Yeah.

346
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,840
Scott: You lost two turns, so two shields and four wheats.

347
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,819
Rym: So, the fact that this was, you know, the game, you always have to think about this when you play games.

348
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,440
Rym: Games present choices, at least good games, for a reason.

349
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:24,220
Rym: So, if there's no reason to make a choice, the game shouldn't give you that choice.

350
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,779
Scott: That's right.

351
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,479
Rym: Of course, games like The Stanley Parable pointedly give you choices that don't matter, and then rub your nose in it.

352
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:41,240
Rym: So, it's interesting that so many people never considered it, and the article goes on and talks about how it actually does matter, and how, basically, well, you should read the article.

353
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,060
Rym: I'm not gonna spoil it.

354
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,200
Scott: Well, no, they simulated it with a computer, right?

355
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,660
Scott: They played through a zillion games, and they found that moving...

356
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,400
Rym: Spoilers.

357
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:49,599
Scott: On average, yeah, sure.

358
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:53,797
Scott: Helps you, because you're going to a better spot, assuming you don't have the awesome starting...

359
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,660
Rym: Yep, so it assumes you don't have the biased start, and it assumes you're not dumb.

360
00:18:57,921 --> 00:19:03,980
Scott: Right, it's like, you're gonna move, you're gonna get into a better spot, usually, and then that's gonna add up to being more, right?

361
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,279
Rym: They did do an interesting control.

362
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:14,099
Rym: They would test the same civ, one not moving, and one not moving, and not settling the first turn.

363
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:16,579
Rym: And that one objectively just did way worse.

364
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:24,100
Scott: Yeah, I mean, there's always the thing of, you have a starting spot that they put you in, and it's like, you can actually move the settler and push B on turn one.

365
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,740
Scott: So, it's like, what if they put your settler one space away from the coast?

366
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:29,920
Scott: Do you go and make your city a coastal city?

367
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:33,380
Scott: Or do you just park it where it is and get a little bit more land in there?

368
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,580
Rym: I've decided that the answer in Civ 5 is yes, you need that fucking coastal city, Jesus.

369
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,130
Rym: Oh my god.

370
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,020
Scott: Oh my god.

371
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,119
Scott: What if you start with your settler in the middle of, like, you know, Kansas?

372
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:54,180
Rym: Well, the thing is, the trouble with coastal cities is, well, if you're near the coast at all, but not on the coast, you're fucked, because you can't build a lot of the water things, you can't build ships, but other ships can still bombard your shit.

373
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:55,360
Scott: Barbarian boats.

374
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,759
Rym: But if you're not barbarian boats, me with frigates.

375
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:00,400
Scott: You're talking about later in the game.

376
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:07,260
Rym: Yeah, in multiplayer games, as soon as I can get out to the ocean, I declare war on everyone and just start bombarding their cities just for the fuck of it.

377
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:07,671
Rym: Yeah.

378
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:09,940
Rym: I'm kind of a jerk in Civ games.

379
00:20:10,302 --> 00:20:10,517
Scott: Anyway.

380
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,120
Rym: Anyway, so, early game, late game, that's kind of the topic here.

381
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,287
Scott: It's also mid-game, right?

382
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:27,380
Scott: So, pretty much any game you play, even a game that seems like it might not, like a game that's so, I guess Rock, Paper, Scissors does not have an early, mid, and late game, right?

383
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,120
Rym: Well, Sean, Ken, Po, early, mid, late.

384
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:31,999
Scott: No, not really.

385
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:45,100
Scott: But any game where you have to make more than one decision in sequence before the result happens, right, can be broken up into sort of phases, right, which are pretty different from each other.

386
00:20:45,221 --> 00:20:46,174
Scott: Even tic-tac-toe, right?

387
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,260
Scott: The early game is like the setup, right?

388
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:55,998
Scott: The mid-game is don't die, and the late game is finish them off, or actually tie, right?

389
00:20:57,621 --> 00:21:00,900
Scott: Ice hockey, the early game, try to score a goal.

390
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,360
Scott: The mid-game, depending on who's winning, either go to stronger defense or stronger offense.

391
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,120
Scott: The late game, desperate attempt, pull your goalie if you're only one down, right?

392
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:17,120
Scott: You sort of, or, you know, just kill time on the clock to put the other team away once you get the puck.

393
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,040
Rym: Yep, onside kick, onside kick.

394
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,813
Scott: Right, yeah, football, same deal, right?

395
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:26,439
Scott: Early on in football, you want to take control of the ball, you want to score early points, get an early lead.

396
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,040
Scott: Mid-game, you just sort of, you know, if you've got the lead, play conservatively.

397
00:21:30,741 --> 00:21:35,000
Scott: If you don't, you know, just, you know, you've got to play a little, you know, more risky.

398
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,540
Scott: In the late game, onside kicks, crazy shit, just try to get points any way you can.

399
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:52,238
Rym: Now, I think there's a lot of differences in terms of the actual discussion between, I guess, ortho games, which is what we're discussing, but I think ortho games in sports or dexterity games have, in some ways, fundamentally different structures.

400
00:21:52,418 --> 00:22:00,640
Rym: in that, is early or late game a question of progress and ability versus the cumulative effect of the decisions you have made?

401
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,598
Rym: I mean, the football team doesn't choose to get tackled one yard away from a first down.

402
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:08,480
Rym: Well, unless you're the Broncos.

403
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,580
Scott: No, but I mean, any game has, it's about the time, right?

404
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:15,119
Scott: You know, football has a clock, hockey has a clock.

405
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:23,019
Rym: But ortho games that are not time-based, like board games, they have a time, I think they were getting that, in the sense of number of decisions left to be made.

406
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:23,622
Scott: Right.

407
00:22:24,065 --> 00:22:26,580
Scott: It's, you know, how much of the game is left?

408
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,920
Scott: How close are we to fulfilling the condition to where the game is over, the winner is deciding?

409
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,229
Rym: How many turns will I get?

410
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:33,720
Rym: How many motions will I take?

411
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,605
Scott: And most, you know, pretty much almost every game, you know, you start off early, you know, take Agricola or Puerto Rico or any of these.

412
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:45,100
Scott: Early on, what you're trying to do is just get base resources, so it's sort of a resource grab, right?

413
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:51,940
Scott: The mid game is use the resources you grabbed to build a machine of some kind, right?

414
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,499
Scott: You know, to get your stuff going.

415
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:58,880
Scott: And then the late game is use that machine as efficiently as possible, right?

416
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,760
Scott: So all three of these phases, you know, in a good game end up mattering, right?

417
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:11,140
Scott: If you don't get enough resources in the early game, then in the mid game, you're not going to be able to build the machine you wanted, right?

418
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,940
Scott: You know, in exactly the way you wanted.

419
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:24,838
Scott: But even if some guy builds a less efficient machine than you, in the late game, you have to crank that machine and they might end up cranking theirs harder to make up for the fact that theirs is crappier, right?

420
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:31,760
Rym: It's extremely obvious in games that have ways to change when the game ends.

421
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:37,900
Rym: If a player who's behind has an ability to extend the game, then suddenly the number of decisions is variable.

422
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,520
Rym: It's almost like the rocket fuel equation.

423
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,360
Rym: How much rocket fuel do I need depends on how much rocket fuel I bring.

424
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,240
Scott: Now, sometimes you have a bad game.

425
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:50,900
Scott: And bad games still tend to follow the same basic, you know, flow with the early, mid, and late game.

426
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,440
Scott: But, if the game is broken or bad in some way, one or more of those phases may not matter.

427
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,599
Rym: I'll give you a really abstract example from a game.

428
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,365
Rym:  So Borderlands 1.

429
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:01,299
Scott:  I'll give you a real example.

430
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,393
Rym: Borderlands 1.

431
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:11,360
Rym: In the early game, you're extremely, or even for a single player, straight up ideal game, Deus Ex Human Revolution.

432
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:18,709
Rym: In the early game, your customization of weapons and picking up the right weapon and choosing the right weapons matters a lot.

433
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:23,340
Rym: What skill tree you unlock and what skill you use next matters a lot.

434
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,219
Rym: It has huge effects on your game.

435
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,260
Rym: Toward the mid and late game, whatever, it's a sniper rifle.

436
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,300
Rym: Who cares if it does explosion damage or whatever?

437
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,410
Rym: It has the highest numbers.

438
00:24:32,754 --> 00:24:39,079
Rym: And suddenly, this whole aspect of the game of inventory management or skill tree management, you're still doing it.

439
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:42,379
Rym: You're doing the exact same thing you're doing in the beginning, but it doesn't matter and you don't care anymore.

440
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,379
Rym: It doesn't affect the game anymore.

441
00:24:46,062 --> 00:24:52,120
Scott: But yeah, in a bad game, you might have a situation where early on there's a resource grab, right?

442
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:54,279
Scott: Everyone grabs resources as quick as they can.

443
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:00,459
Scott: Whoever gets the most resources at the beginning just wins because it's just so obvious what to do with them.

444
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:03,580
Scott: And anyone who failed at the first part can't stop them.

445
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:10,357
Scott: So in effect, the early game is the whole game, and the mid and late game are just obvious or inconsequential decisions.

446
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Rym: For example, look at really bad games like Risk.

447
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:18,539
Rym: All decisions are inconsequential or obvious, except for the setup basically determines victory.

448
00:25:19,062 --> 00:25:20,600
Rym: But the setup is also random.

449
00:25:21,975 --> 00:25:22,118
Scott: Yep.

450
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:22,220
Scott: Yep.

451
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,309
Scott: You know, in Stratego, the early game is the setting up of your board and the poking around.

452
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:33,080
Scott: The mid game is find where their shit is and the late game is go in there and actually try to take their shit.

453
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:33,970
Rym: Yep.

454
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:34,618
Rym: Actually execute.

455
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,853
Rym: I mean, the dance of "Is the spy there or not?

456
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:39,119
Rym: Do I have minors to get

457
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:39,340
Rym: there?".

458
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:39,958
Rym: That sort of thing.

459
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,980
Rym: But even then, look, skill differentials matter a lot.

460
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:50,960
Rym: Two very skilled Stratego players, the early game, meaning the setup, is literally all that matters because neither player will make a mistake.

461
00:25:52,060 --> 00:26:00,720
Rym: So some games, all phases other than choosing a strategy boil down to not accidentally failing to execute that strategy.

462
00:26:02,643 --> 00:26:05,200
Rym: Or not choosing the wrong strategy.

463
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:08,880
Rym: And we talk with all these characteristics of games.

464
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,560
Rym: Every time we talk about this stuff, it comes down to this same problem, both with the decision trees, with everything.

465
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:25,399
Rym: If you have a strategy, then choosing a strategy and comparing that to what strategy the other person chose is the only thing that matters.

466
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:28,580
Rym: Luckily, we're humans, not robots.

467
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,500
Rym: We can't execute these things perfectly.

468
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:42,580
Rym: So the late game of Stratego still matters because even though I know, or like in hockey, I know to put the puck in the net, I might fail to execute on my plan in the end even if I know to pull the goalie.

469
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,340
Rym: So the decisions at the end matter and the execution still matters because we're humans.

470
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,099
Rym: But if robots play hockey, then the strategy of how the robots are programmed before the game is all that matters.

471
00:26:54,422 --> 00:26:59,940
Scott: Yeah, I mean, this whole concept, it's like, is every game just early, mid, and late?

472
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:02,159
Scott: Isn't there other sort of phases in there?

473
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,660
Scott: I guess you could make a game that has intentional multiple phases, right?

474
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,600
Rym: Well, Amun-Re has it, but kind of fake.

475
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:17,019
Rym: You play the game twice, and the second game is just seeded with data from the previous game.

476
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,580
Rym: But even then, gameplay-wise, it's just early, mid, late game.

477
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:26,559
Rym: You might have a sub-game where it's early, mid, late of sub-game A, early, mid, late of sub-game B.

478
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:35,780
Scott: But the key to being good at a lot of games sometimes is all the things we've always said in other episodes and other panels and whatnot.

479
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:41,580
Scott: But to know, there isn't this clear-cut line in a lot of games, like we are now in the mid-game.

480
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,459
Scott: The mid-game starts exactly now.

481
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:46,520
Scott: The late game just started exactly at this moment.

482
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:48,660
Rym: DPT, end game, end game.

483
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,827
Scott: Right, exactly.

484
00:27:49,847 --> 00:27:56,419
Scott: You just sort of have to know when you're going from one to the other and recognize that and act accordingly, right?

485
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,440
Scott: Because, say, you're playing, I don't know, Puerto Rico, right?

486
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:02,798
Scott: In the early game, there's a lot of settling going on.

487
00:28:03,462 --> 00:28:06,260
Scott: In the mid-game, there's maybe a little bit of settling, but not much.

488
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,160
Scott: In the late game, no settling at all, really.

489
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,500
Rym: So if you have a strategy that needs someone to settle a lot in the late game, yeah, you're screwed.

490
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,520
Rym: You're the only one settling.

491
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:20,300
Scott: But if you say that the governor comes around to you and it's your turn to choose something, right?

492
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:27,600
Scott: Everyone was, you know, you're still thinking it's the late game, I mean, the early game, you know, so is it still a good idea to settle?

493
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,421
Scott: Right?

494
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:38,598
Scott: But you look around and maybe, you know, the game has actually moved on to the mid-game, you're not quite sure, and if you settle with that slightly late settling, that might hurt you.

495
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,640
Scott: It was like, oh, no, if it was earlier and you settled, that would have been a good idea, but now, too late.

496
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,645
Rym: Well, settle.

497
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:59,779
Rym: If I send, if I still play early game and I'm sending out settlers in Civ 2 far and wide, eventually I have 15 one or two population cities, Scott has four cities, but they have populations of like five and he has military units.

498
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,519
Rym: I'm still playing the early game and now mid-game Scott destroys early game Rym.

499
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:11,560
Scott: It's all of you have to sort of know, like, when in a game it's time to sort of change gears and do something different.

500
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:19,499
Rym: I think we can recommend the exact board game that might be the best game I've ever seen at teaching people how to identify this.

501
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:20,689
Rym: St.

502
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,280
Rym: Petersburg.

503
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,420
Scott: That's a true one.

504
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:22,662
Rym: St.

505
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:24,051
Rym: Petersburg is a game.

506
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:25,380
Rym: We've reviewed it on GeekNights, I think.

507
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,220
Rym: I'll link to it if we did.

508
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,799
Scott: A long time ago, yeah.

509
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:33,020
Rym: I'm assuming we did, but basically you want money as way more valuable than anything in the beginning of the game.

510
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,220
Rym: Victory points are way more valuable than anything at the end of the game.

511
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:37,800
Rym: Obviously.

512
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,157
Rym: There's two ways to get victory points, buildings and a culturally insensitive term.

513
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,329
Rym: So, if-- Nobles.

514
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,300
Rym: Yeah, nobles.

515
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:48,438
Rym: Nobles.

516
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:49,539
Rym: I'm making quote marks.

517
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:50,300
Scott: Right?

518
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,499
Scott: Basically, there's green cards, which are the most efficient way to get money.

519
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,640
Scott: It's a game of buying cards that then make resources, which you then use to buy more cards.

520
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,219
Scott: It's a little game.

521
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:01,620
Scott: So, the green cards make you the most money the most efficiently.

522
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:04,320
Scott: The blue cards make you the most victory points.

523
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:16,300
Scott: The orange noble cards both make victory points and money, sort of, but the more different kinds of orange cards you have, nobles, you can also get a ton of victory points.

524
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,399
Scott: And then there's weird upgrade cards that are just sort of bonus-y.

525
00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:26,640
Scott: So, you have to figure out in the game, everyone at the beginning of the game, right, gets green cards, hardcore.

526
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:34,320
Scott: You have to figure out when to stop going for all these crazy green cards and concentrate more on the blue and the orange cards.

527
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,800
Rym: Yeah, but it's easy to be trick because everything is cumulative.

528
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:43,260
Rym: So, if you get a four victory point building, as soon as you get it, that's four victory points every turn for the rest of the game.

529
00:30:43,562 --> 00:30:47,200
Rym: Get it three turns before Scott, that's 12 victory points extra.

530
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,379
Rym: But the gold cards do the exact same thing.

531
00:30:51,243 --> 00:31:00,699
Scott: But if you just buy an amazing victory point thing in the first turn, you're actually going to lose because even though you get a ton of victory points, you are not getting enough money to get any more victory points.

532
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:04,539
Scott: You did a late game move in the early game and messed you up.

533
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:16,240
Rym: It's a good game to teach this because the line between early game and mid game is so well defined that I could almost write a treatise on the exact moment when it occurs in the game.

534
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:31,960
Rym: It got to the point to where when we would play this game among the crew, like me and Scott and our friends, pretty much we would all, no one person could just deal out all the cards and play everyone perfectly until the mid game and then we could all take our real turns because it was deterministic.

535
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:44,939
Rym: The point at which the game becomes mid game is the point at which the player who is going to win buys a blue victory point card instead of buying an extra green card.

536
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:52,199
Rym: And if you do it one turn too soon among skilled players, you are guaranteed to lose.

537
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,820
Rym: If you do it one turn too late, you're almost guaranteed to lose.

538
00:31:56,141 --> 00:32:00,160
Rym: You might be able to bring it back in the late game with the upgrades and the nobles.

539
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,297
Scott: Depending on your luck.

540
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:02,600
Rym: Yes, and your skill.

541
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:03,799
Scott: It is a card game after all.

542
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:08,536
Rym: Now the transition between mid game and late game is similarly well defined but not as harsh.

543
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:20,240
Rym: It's when you switch from getting novel orange cards and blue cards to planning the turn order to ensure that your final turns are spent getting a chance for upgrades.

544
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:23,579
Rym: Which is much more complicated to do.

545
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,230
Rym: So if you can play St.

546
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:33,260
Rym: Petersburg, it's a pretty simple and actually really fun board game to the point that you can really well identify early, mid, and late game.

547
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:36,220
Rym: You will have super powers when you play most other games.

548
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,840
Scott: Now why is it that these games sort of have the early, mid, late?

549
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,540
Scott: Why can't there be a game with like five phases?

550
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,680
Scott: Super early, kinda early, middling, kinda late, super late.

551
00:32:45,962 --> 00:32:46,860
Scott: How come that doesn't happen?

552
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,340
Scott: It always seems to come in threes.

553
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,540
Scott: Every game I think of, there's always this sort of early, middle, late.

554
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:57,960
Scott: The initial building, the halving and using, and then the finishing move.

555
00:32:58,263 --> 00:32:58,840
Rym: I have a good answer.

556
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,040
Rym: I don't know if you're building toward one or not.

557
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:01,376
Rym: No.

558
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,740
Rym: Now you're just putting the question out?

559
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:07,160
Scott: Can you think of a game that has more than three sort of strategic phases in it?

560
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,040
Rym: The game that Gurgi plays in Player of Games.

561
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:10,620
Rym: Sure.

562
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,839
Rym: But that's just a bunch of sub-games that all have a That all have three phases to them?

563
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,279
Rym: I have a pretty simple argument that I just came up with.

564
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,920
Rym: So if there's a hole in the logic, I would love anyone to tell us why you disagree.

565
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:31,480
Rym: I think the reason this is the perfect delineation of game phases is that if you add more distinction, the distinction becomes less meaningful.

566
00:33:32,281 --> 00:33:40,034
Rym: And it becomes so much less meaningful that if I try to split Civ V into beginning, early, early, early, mid-early, late-early.

567
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:50,300
Rym: Like if I try to break up that early game into all these different phases, then those individual phases branch depending on what kind of strategy I'm pursuing.

568
00:33:51,122 --> 00:34:03,020
Rym: So my early, early, late, mid-game might be building an extra phalanx when otherwise I could have built a warrior for fewer resources or an extra settler.

569
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:18,000
Rym: But it becomes so game-specific or so strategy-specific or so sort of diverse in terms of decision trees that it becomes absolutely useless except when you're discussing an individual game.

570
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:19,344
Scott: Any game, these three phases don't actually exist.

571
00:34:24,223 --> 00:34:26,857
Scott: There is no definition like "it begins

572
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:27,119
Scott: now."

573
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,179
Scott: It's just this flow of a game from beginning to end.

574
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,900
Scott: The longer the game, the longer the flow.

575
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:36,179
Scott: But it just sort of flows up and flows down to the end.

576
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,518
Scott: Pretty much every game is like that no matter what.

577
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:45,920
Scott: So if you cut it into six pieces, how different is piece 4 and piece 5 going to be in the flow?

578
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:46,918
Scott: Not very different.

579
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:49,550
Scott: But cutting things into three pieces, it's like.

580
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:56,058
Scott: sure, if you look right on the line, is there a difference between this turn and two turns from now?

581
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:56,520
Scott: strategically?

582
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,719
Scott: Yeah, a small amount.

583
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,559
Scott: But cutting into three pieces, you can pretty clearly see there's a big difference between these things.

584
00:35:05,982 --> 00:35:10,580
Scott: You only need to think in three pieces in order to get a handle on what you should be doing.

585
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:16,520
Rym: At best I could propose adding, but again it's game specific, a fourth phase.

586
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:18,080
Rym: Setup.

587
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:20,340
Scott: Before you even start playing?

588
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:24,020
Rym: Settlers has the setup and then early/mid/late game.

589
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,920
Rym: But again, as soon as you add that phase, it's not applicable to all games.

590
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:39,480
Rym: The three phases is probably the sweet spot of differentiating enough to be useful but globally or universally applicable enough to apply to the vast majority of games.

591
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:41,939
Rym: Even single player games.

592
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:43,880
Rym: Look at all the story games you've played.

593
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:51,839
Rym: There's usually the similar progression of early/mid/late phases of how much do your story decisions matter, how much do your choices matter or not.

594
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:58,500
Scott: Yeah, I've been playing Netrunner like crazy and people talk about early/mid/late game in Netrunner like crazy.

595
00:35:59,162 --> 00:36:00,520
Scott: That's their favorite thing to talk about.

596
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:08,039
Scott: And it's pretty much in the early game, the corp can defend a little bit but not quite because they don't have enough money and ice yet maybe.

597
00:36:08,442 --> 00:36:11,560
Scott: So the runner can sort of do a lot of stuff in the early game without any cards.

598
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,119
Scott: Then in the mid game, the corp's usually defended.

599
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,237
Scott: The runner is trying to build up stuff so that they can still get in.

600
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:21,117
Scott: But they don't really have everything built up yet so the corp can actually score.

601
00:36:23,262 --> 00:36:27,837
Scott: And then in the late game, the runner usually has everything built and it's very likely in most--.

602
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:38,119
Scott: This obviously can change based on what people are playing but it's most likely that the runner can just go anywhere they want and the corp has got to find some tricky way to finish it off.

603
00:36:39,504 --> 00:36:40,500
Rym: I think this is a side topic.

604
00:36:41,863 --> 00:36:46,480
Rym: I don't want to delve into too much terminology or jargon so I'll avoid all the Garfield-type terms.

605
00:36:47,423 --> 00:37:01,920
Rym: But I've noticed that the kinds of players who take way too long in their turn, even if they understand the phases of a game in some sense, they're unable to recognize when choices matter or don't because of when they occur.

606
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:09,680
Rym: Whether or not I choose captain or settler in the first ten turns of Puerto Rico matters like crazy.

607
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,200
Rym: What I choose toward the end of the game doesn't matter as much.

608
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,300
Rym: One, because many of the choices I have are basically excluded for me because I know that they're suboptimal.

609
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:22,130
Rym: They're off the Pareto frontier.

610
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,319
Rym: I can just straight up ignore them.

611
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,252
Rym: So I actually have fewer effective choices.

612
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:31,900
Rym: so my decisions are easier because even if I act randomly, I'm acting randomly from within fewer choices.

613
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,520
Rym: so I can analyze those choices more fully and more quickly.

614
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:44,060
Rym: Players who take too long in their turn don't seem to realize that the one extra wood card in your hand for that trade doesn't matter for shit at the end of settlers.

615
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:45,275
Scott: No, it doesn't.

616
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:56,195
Rym: So recognize when the phase changes, not just how this affects your strategy, but more specifically, what decisions no longer matter.

617
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:57,240
Rym: so you can ignore them.

618
00:37:58,261 --> 00:38:05,279
Rym: I don't micromanage every military unit when I have a hundred military units in Civ V. That is almost never going to help me.

619
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,940
Scott: But at the very beginning of Civ, every warrior is important.

620
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,540
Rym: Every hex every warrior moves is important.

621
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,319
Scott: Right, like a little pile of gold moving around the map.

622
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:21,760
Rym: So yeah, I think we could turn this into a pretty good PAX panel.

623
00:38:22,606 --> 00:38:23,459
Scott: We got no other ideas.

624
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:27,816
Rym: I'm really hungry and I gotta fly to London in the morning because I think we're done here.

625
00:38:29,347 --> 00:38:30,500
Rym: It's the late phase of the podcast.

626
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,740
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
