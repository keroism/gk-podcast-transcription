1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,038
Rym: It's Wednesday, July 30th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:10,258
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,006
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,921
Rym: And this is GeekNights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,270
Rym: Superpowers.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,730
Scott: Not superpowers, special attacks.

7
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,010
Rym: Special attacks only including superpowers?

8
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,830
Scott: No, it just could be a special attack of any kind.

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,023
Rym: So we're saying that this can be anything that we would do.

10
00:00:28,063 --> 00:00:29,170
Rym: What is a special attack?

11
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,330
Scott: We'll get to that later.

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,521
Rym: Alright, let's do this.

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,530
Rym: It's later, so what is a special attack?

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,488
Scott: This is the main bit of the show, not the opening bit.

15
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:38,798
Scott: The opening bit.

16
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,470
Scott: I got to talk about other stuff.

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,689
Scott: So this morning I'm biking to work.

18
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:43,187
Rym: Yup.

19
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:46,270
Scott: And my little water bottle cage is going rattle, rattle, rattle, rattle, rattle.

20
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:49,230
Rym: So you leaned over to try to fix it, didn't you?

21
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:49,434
Rym: No.

22
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:50,129
Rym: Okay.

23
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,208
Scott: I stopped to try to fix it.

24
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:52,868
Rym: Yup.

25
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:55,889
Scott: So I get to the other side of the bridge and I'm going to pull over.

26
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:57,590
Rym: Midtown bridge, right?

27
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,189
Scott: Yeah, 59th street bridge.

28
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,349
Scott: Get to the other side and there's a dip in the curb where cars go to get over the curb.

29
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:04,819
Rym: Yup.

30
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:10,410
Scott: So I turn to the right and go hop up that curb, but that curb is too damn high.

31
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:18,490
Rym: You know, you and Emily both have difficulties with curbs like that and I think the reason is you didn't grow up mountain biking.

32
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:20,630
Scott: Anyway, so I fell over.

33
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,409
Rym: Did I teach you guys a class on how to hop a curb?

34
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,186
Scott: No, so I fell over and I was like, "Oh, well,

35
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:27,688
Scott: whatever.".

36
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,608
Scott: Get up and I'm like, "Oh, my knees are bleeding and I don't really feel any pain over

37
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:32,789
Scott: there.".

38
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:36,849
Scott: I still don't, but there was really nothing I could do about that until I got to work.

39
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,850
Scott: So I got up and brushed- You could have called 911 and just sat there.

40
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:41,407
Scott: Yeah, no.

41
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:47,670
Scott: I got up and brushed myself off and went to work after adjusting my water bottle cage a little bit.

42
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:53,730
Rym: I want to preface this next bit because you give pretty much continuous shit.

43
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:02,110
Rym: You throw shade, in fact, is the phrase I'm going to start using now, on the internet in general at people who have a phone that has a crack.

44
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:09,648
Scott: I do, but those people who have a phone that has a crack, if I ask them, "How did that phone get

45
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:10,068
Scott: cracked?"

46
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,790
Scott: It's a dumbass reason or they don't even say the reason because it's so dumb.

47
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,890
Rym: Like not knowing how to hop a curb?

48
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,950
Scott: No, falling off a bike is a legit reason to have a crack in a phone.

49
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:27,150
Rym: Yeah, maybe if you were riding and a band of Fist of the North Star villains hit you with a baseball bat, knocking you off the bike.

50
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,870
Scott: Dropping it by being a careless buffoon is not a legit reason.

51
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:33,950
Scott: Just because you have butterfingers.

52
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,749
Scott: Also, I've dropped my phone more than once.

53
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,370
Scott: For example, laying in bed, reach over to put it down and it slides onto the floor instead of onto the place where you want to put it.

54
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,428
Rym: Yup, that's happened to me.

55
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:46,470
Scott: And my phone is not shattered.

56
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,904
Rym: Of course, remember, I had that Nexus S that I had.

57
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,510
Rym: I dropped it all the time and it was just invincible.

58
00:02:53,570 --> 00:03:02,030
Rym: And then one day, I was walking out of my building and I opened the door and the door just bumped lightly into my leg where the phone was in my pocket.

59
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:04,970
Rym: And the entire screen just shattered.

60
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,670
Scott: Anyway, the only part of my phone that was broken was a tiny piece of glass in the rear at the top that goes around the camera lens and whatnot.

61
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,890
Rym: Yup, because the whole back of mine is just shattered and cracked.

62
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,968
Scott: Mine's not that bad.

63
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,770
Rym: Well, that crack's been growing for a month.

64
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:23,350
Scott: Anyway, I didn't realize this was a problem because it was still working.

65
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:29,270
Scott: My pebble watch was getting messages and the phone was beeping until I went and the phone was beeping so much from tweets.

66
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,369
Scott: I went to go turn it on vibrate and I saw the screen was fucked the fuck up.

67
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:35,641
Scott: And I was like, "Oh,

68
00:03:35,763 --> 00:03:36,006
Scott: shit.".

69
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:39,550
Scott: So I'm like, "Oh, well, what are my options here?

70
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,330
Scott: Go to Verizon and get a really shitty phone until the iPhone 6 comes out in like two months?

71
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:47,209
Scott: Or go to the Apple store and see what they do and I don't have

72
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:47,410
Scott: AppleCare?".

73
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,108
Scott: And then my coworker was like, "Just buy an unlocked phone on

74
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:51,350
Scott: eBay.".

75
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,017
Scott: I'm like, "I need a phone within like an hour.

76
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:54,022
Scott: I cannot have a

77
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:54,162
Scott: phone.".

78
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:05,510
Rym: Yeah, when this happened to me way back with my Nexus S, I ordered with rush shipping a used unlocked phone that was identical to the phone I had.

79
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:06,749
Scott: I need something right the fuck now.

80
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,299
Rym: I was able to make it a day.

81
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,090
Rym: I got my phone actually the next day.

82
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:14,490
Scott: He googled and he found a place real nearby, iPhone repair, something, something.

83
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:16,113
Scott: I went there.

84
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:17,119
Scott: I just walked on over.

85
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,344
Scott: I walk in.

86
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:19,529
Scott: I show him the phone.

87
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,787
Scott: The lady at the counter is like, "Oh, that's blah, blah, blah, 90 bucks, 15

88
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:24,068
Scott: minutes.".

89
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:25,434
Scott: I'm like, "What?

90
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:28,047
Scott: Whatever you just said, I will swipe my credit

91
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:28,268
Scott: card.".

92
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:32,185
Scott: I sit down and there's a little waiting area.

93
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,270
Scott: There's two other people waiting.

94
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,776
Scott: While I'm waiting, they're done and they leave.

95
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,230
Scott: There's no one else there except the people working.

96
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:42,150
Scott: One guy's banging on iPad frames to get him into shape or something.

97
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:48,090
Scott: I start reading this article in Wired magazine about this Instagram photographer or whatever.

98
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:51,810
Rym: All right, because there's nothing you can do while you're waiting.

99
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,040
Scott: With no phone, yeah.

100
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:55,507
Scott: They have magazines there.

101
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:56,090
Scott: They're not stupid.

102
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:00,502
Scott: I'm not even on page two.

103
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:01,266
Scott: She's like,

104
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:01,648
Scott: "Scott?".

105
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:05,675
Scott: I'm like,

106
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:05,776
Scott: "Huh?".

107
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:13,350
Scott: The back of it was still smushed, but the screen was fixed as 100% functional because the front wasn't smashed.

108
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,634
Rym: You know what the moral of that is?

109
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:19,150
Rym: Never pay for phone replacement insurance because it's a scam.

110
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:33,045
Scott: Obviously, but the thing is one person suggested on the internet way later in the day, "Hey, maybe the connector that connects the video card to the screen was just a little bit detached and the Apple store may have fixed that for free for

111
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:33,206
Scott: you.".

112
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:35,697
Scott: I'm like, "All right,

113
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:36,099
Scott: whatever.".

114
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,570
Scott: I wasn't upset paying 90 bucks.

115
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:41,305
Rym: That's the other reason why this is so easy for us.

116
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:41,950
Rym: We have money.

117
00:05:43,514 --> 00:05:43,695
Scott: Yeah.

118
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:45,944
Scott: I guess it's like where should I have gone first?

119
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:47,290
Scott: The Apple store was much further away.

120
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,468
Rym: The thing is I was willing to wait about 24 hours to get my phone back and I lived.

121
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:53,070
Rym: I managed.

122
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,238
Scott: No.

123
00:05:56,312 --> 00:06:05,703
Scott: But yeah, this place, especially if you have something like your screen is cracked like most of you, that the Apple store isn't going to just fix, this place.

124
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,290
Scott: It was a miracle, this place.

125
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:08,970
Scott: It's amazing.

126
00:06:10,293 --> 00:06:10,514
Rym: Yeah.

127
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,141
Rym: In the news, I don't have a lot of news.

128
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:16,102
Rym: The Eisner Awards happened and all I'll say- Oh, my prediction was 100% correct, wasn't it?

129
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,870
Rym: The official Geeknights prediction was in fact prognostication.

130
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:22,216
Rym: Yeah.

131
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:25,010
Scott: Saga takes all categories in which it was nominated.

132
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:37,550
Scott: If you are listening to this right now and you do not read Saga, either every single issue as it comes out in digital or paper form, or like me, every trade paperback as soon as it comes out in paper form, what?

133
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:41,350
Rym: I mean, it's not the greatest comic ever written by Matt.

134
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,454
Scott: It's not Watchmen.

135
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:46,389
Scott: It is simply the greatest ... I don't know.

136
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,910
Scott: I don't want to just limit it to comics.

137
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:48,560
Scott: Remember?

138
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:48,770
Scott: Remember?

139
00:06:48,971 --> 00:07:00,130
Scott: It's the best comic or also pretty much any narrative, including serial TV shows, movies, books, and comic books, right?

140
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,512
Scott: It is the best fictional narrative thing- What?

141
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,169
Rym: Not Sailor Moon?

142
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,390
Scott: That is being created and released at this moment.

143
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:11,470
Rym: That was pretty qualified, but I think pretty accurate.

144
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,689
Scott: It's the best current narrative fiction thing of all mediums.

145
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,399
Rym: I'll put it this way.

146
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,810
Rym: If that shit were on HBO and I couldn't pirate it, I would pay for HBO somehow.

147
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,289
Rym: Actually, no, because there's no way to pay for HBO, so I'd pirate it.

148
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,410
Scott: I mean, clearly, it is not better than things that have happened and completed.

149
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,160
Rym: It also might not be better for you.

150
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,350
Rym: You might like really shitty things.

151
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:42,355
Scott: It's also not necessarily better than all things yet to come, but of fictional narrative works of art that are being created and released.

152
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:45,130
Scott: at this moment in time, it is the best one.

153
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,670
Rym: It has the highest average score of all aspects.

154
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,149
Scott: Yes.

155
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:51,178
Rym: I'll make it more simple.

156
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,042
Rym: Remember how we said Player of Games was maybe not the best book ever written, but- It's not the best book ever written.

157
00:07:57,364 --> 00:07:58,090
Rym: It's not even close.

158
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:07,529
Rym: It was the book that was the closest you could ever get to a book that was basically- The title might as well have been, "Hey, Rym and Scott, here's a book that you and the people who listen to your show will

159
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:07,710
Rym: like."

160
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:10,830
Scott: Except for The Darkness That Comes Before.

161
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:18,323
Rym: Yeah, well, that was, "Hey, you and your friends, but not everyone who listens to your show, will talk about this book perennially for the rest of your

162
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:18,866
Rym: lives.".

163
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:23,810
Rym: So let's go on the opposite tack to something that's going to be shit.

164
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,669
Rym: So I'm going to make another prognostication here.

165
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:27,769
Scott: This is not a hard prognostication to make.

166
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:28,970
Rym: People are going crazy.

167
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,026
Scott: We're getting Nostra Rym over here.

168
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:31,708
Scott: Rym Adamus.

169
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,881
Rym: You know who I am?

170
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:33,590
Rym: Isaac.

171
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:34,429
Scott: Isaac.

172
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,169
Rym: For the main bit, I want to talk about Isaac.

173
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,510
Rym: I think he had a pretty good superpower.

174
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:39,950
Scott: Rym Adamus over there.

175
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,630
Rym: Spoilers for Escaflowne, by the way.

176
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,840
Scott: Yeah.

177
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:46,450
Rym: So at SDCC, they showed a trailer.

178
00:08:46,951 --> 00:08:48,390
Scott: They showed like 10 billion trailers.

179
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,190
Rym: Yeah, and some people probably waited in line like 14 hours to see this, and I just saw it on YouTube.

180
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,550
Scott: Well, you know what I figured out, right?

181
00:08:54,931 --> 00:09:00,810
Scott: I sort of knew this, but I totally confirmed it this year, is that basically that Hall H, they don't room clear.

182
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:01,970
Scott: Oh, yeah.

183
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:10,470
Scott: So people just go in immediately in the morning, they stay in that room without leaving all goddamn day to see the one panel they want to see at like four, right?

184
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:11,910
Scott: Because otherwise they're not going to get to see it.

185
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,290
Scott: They should just fucking room clear that shit.

186
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,930
Rym: I can tell you why they don't room clear.

187
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:22,109
Rym: One, room clearing's smart, and it's the kind of thing that conventions that actually care about the average attendees' experience do.

188
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:22,622
Rym: Mm-hmm.

189
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:23,870
Rym: That's so already.

190
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:33,530
Scott: But on the other hand, some people posted that because the fact that it doesn't room clear, a bunch of people were forced to sit through like some feminism-type panels they might not have wanted to sit through.

191
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,330
Scott: But from my view of pragmatism-- Still, they should room clear.

192
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,009
Rym: I look to our own ConnectiCon policies for lining up.

193
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,170
Scott: If there's a line for the next panel, we room clear.

194
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:48,150
Rym: Let's say there was a line, or let's say they did a room clear for Hall H. How many things do you think are in there in one day?

195
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,167
Scott: Things last about an hour to 90 minutes.

196
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,883
Scott: Convention's probably 10 to 12 hours.

197
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,930
Scott: Yep.

198
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,710
Scott: Maybe like 10 things.

199
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,110
Scott: All right, so 10 things-- I could probably look at the schedule online.

200
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,565
Rym: Yeah, so three days, so say 30 things.

201
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,729
Rym: Let's say we know they're going to clear the room between each thing.

202
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,110
Rym: On Monday, before the con, 30 lines will form.

203
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:08,468
Scott: No, that's not how you do it.

204
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,496
Scott: This is how you do it.

205
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:12,849
Scott: Here's what you should do.

206
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:16,390
Scott: People should still make the one giant line that they always make, right?

207
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:16,676
Scott: Yep.

208
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:24,489
Scott: And then, if you don't want to go into the thing that's currently seating, you just stand still in that line, and the people just walk right past you and go in.

209
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:26,188
Rym: That would suck.

210
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:29,090
Rym: I would just go in, because at least I'm sitting.

211
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:36,270
Scott: And then, when that thing is over, the thing you didn't want to see, you get your ass kicked out, and now you're not even in line.

212
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,230
Scott: You go to the back of the line.

213
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,310
Rym: Oh, you know what I would do instead?

214
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:44,330
Rym: I would just sell tickets to that room, because this con's already a commercial nightmare for attendees.

215
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:47,650
Rym: And I would just make an open bidding system.

216
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:56,368
Scott: Also, if I was a company, and I was having the popular thing, why would I have it in the Hall H?

217
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,250
Scott: I'll just have it across the street and sell tickets to it in a hotel.

218
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:02,870
Rym: Maybe there's a place for that.

219
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:09,230
Scott: If those people are lining up, there's 10 things in the room, they're really lining up for three of those things that have the celebrity they want.

220
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:13,730
Scott: If I'm the people who are having that celebrity panel, why do I need to have it in this convention?

221
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:14,610
Scott: I'll just have it across the street.

222
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:20,388
Rym: Though I did, at the most recent PAX East, have that experience of being in one room all day, seeing everything that was in it.

223
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:22,070
Scott: Oh, right, because you're in the streaming room.

224
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:22,614
Rym: And you know what?

225
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:24,109
Rym: That's worth doing once.

226
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,710
Rym: If you're at a really big con, that was actually kind of an interesting experience.

227
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,609
Scott: Yeah, I mean, in Hall H, you're going to see mad top-level America celebrities, if that's what you're into.

228
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,870
Rym: And you're probably going to be in the front row, because you lined up three weeks in advance.

229
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:39,390
Rym: But not to get off track.

230
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,829
Rym: So one of the trailers they showed was for an Adventure Time game.

231
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,650
Scott: We've already had two of those, and they were not good.

232
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:54,006
Rym: The two Adventure Time games, Hey Ice King, Why'd You Steal Our Garbage, and Let's Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know, are garbage.

233
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,130
Scott: They're not the worst games of all time.

234
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,270
Rym: But they are garbage.

235
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,450
Scott: I don't recommend you purchase or play them.

236
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,930
Rym: So yes, they're not as bad as the active Hitler in the dumpster.

237
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:05,970
Scott: They have playable aspects.

238
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:11,608
Rym: If you have an active Hitler and some poop in a dumpster together, they're both bad and they're both garbage.

239
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,170
Scott: Like there's about 30 seconds of funny Lumpy Space Princess in the one that I played.

240
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:16,812
Rym: You know what?

241
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:20,610
Rym: If you want to experience these Adventure Time games, Watch them on YouTube.

242
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:27,770
Rym: Yes, go on YouTube, watch the cutscenes, and literally, there is zero chance this game will be good.

243
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:31,650
Rym: The developers that are making it made the previous two games.

244
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,649
Rym: They're uninspired, ridiculously bad, poorly done drivel.

245
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:45,636
Scott: Every single game you see on the, since the Game Boy, I guess not since the Game Boy, but since the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, right?

246
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:48,005
Scott: Game Boy DS and 3DS.

247
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:57,590
Scott: Every licensed property game, shovelware for those systems, no matter how good the licensed property, almost all of them have been bad.

248
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,150
Scott: There was one good Astro Boy game for the GBA.

249
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:08,530
Scott: It was a sideways beat 'em up and it wasn't even as good as Final Fighter Streets of Rage, but it was still okay, and that's the only one I can think of right now.

250
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,364
Rym: Just what I don't get is like, it's not even like.

251
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,216
Rym: it's just us saying, "Oh, these games are bad,".

252
00:13:12,236 --> 00:13:14,670
Rym: but then like the people on the internet just eat 'em up.

253
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:22,675
Rym: No, the first comment on this, on this article on IGN, IGN comments, "It better be good.

254
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,345
Rym: The last adventure game was lame and

255
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:24,988
Rym: tiresome.".

256
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,690
Rym: But then again, I think he also answers my question of why they keep making them.

257
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:31,169
Rym: The collector's edition, however, was great.

258
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,124
Scott: What?

259
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,270
Rym: The guy, it was the same game, just with some cheapo stuff in the box.

260
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:39,990
Scott: Maybe he bought it for the stuff.

261
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:40,519
Rym: Yeah.

262
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:46,410
Scott: It's like, if you think about it, you remember those anime, like there was some perverted anime and it came with a pair of underwear?

263
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,110
Rym: Uh-oh, Thomas JGC said, "Hey, Ice King," was pretty good.

264
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:49,630
Scott: Anyway.

265
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:49,954
Scott: Wow.

266
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:53,290
Scott: There was some anime, I remember, back in the day that came with panties.

267
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,170
Rym: Oh, that guy also thinks LSP's voice is really bad, so he's obviously wrong.

268
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:57,550
Scott: Yeah.

269
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,100
Scott: Anyway, imagine if someone bought that, not for the anime and it's bonus panties, but like, "I want the panties.

270
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:05,745
Scott: Oh, DVDs?

271
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:05,946
Scott: Meh.".

272
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:07,462
Rym: I've seen that happen.

273
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:08,009
Rym: I could be there.

274
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:08,688
Scott: Right.

275
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,803
Scott: It's like, "Ooh, I can finally buy some girl's panties without having to go to the girl's panties section of the

276
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:13,308
Scott: store.".

277
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:22,230
Rym: The reason these games are so bad enough to draw my ire, it's kind of like the King Killer Chronicle, Captain Nice Guy's penis adventure through Fedora Land 2, the Sex Chronicles.

278
00:14:23,772 --> 00:14:26,949
Rym: In the second book, he teaches some barbarian women where babies come from.

279
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:27,347
Rym: Anything?

280
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:28,649
Rym: Little known fact.

281
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:42,286
Rym: So, it's that these games start out like they should be really good, by every right they should be good, the licensed property for them is perfect for this kind of thing, and then the fact that it's just shovelware.

282
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:47,989
Rym: after that point, it's like the difference between the first episode of Eden of the East and the last episode of Eden of the East.

283
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:50,690
Rym: That's why I'm so mad about these games.

284
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:57,510
Rym: Fuck these people, and seriously, Pendleton Ward, why are you putting the crusty seal of quality on these games?

285
00:14:59,331 --> 00:14:59,681
Rym: I mean...

286
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,589
Scott: Pay the bills.

287
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,410
Scott: The crusty seal of quality.

288
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,210
Rym: Well, I guess that's actually an apt comparison.

289
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,910
Scott: Anyway, so here's the real news, right?

290
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,367
Scott: The New York Comic-Con we're probably not going to go to.

291
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:20,130
Rym: I've had free badges for like three years, and I didn't even fucking... It's four subway stops away, and I didn't go with my free badges.

292
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:26,210
Scott: Every year, even though it's not really worth going to, even though it's right there, they've had a guest that's worth seeing, right?

293
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:27,969
Rym: I remember way back we got Tomino.

294
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,009
Scott: Yeah, and then we went to see... Makoto Shinkai was there.

295
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:33,263
Scott: Yeah.

296
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:33,621
Scott: Right.

297
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:34,629
Rym: And we saw the movie.

298
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:40,850
Scott: So this year... Who was at the anime... New York Anime Festival?

299
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,868
Scott: Final Fantasy art guy.

300
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:43,764
Scott: Amano?

301
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,829
Scott: Yeah, Amano was there.

302
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,710
Scott: That was one, right?

303
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,310
Scott: So like every year, they get this one mega guest that we actually care about.

304
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:55,610
Scott: This year, they got Takeshi Obata, who is the Death Note Bakuman artist guy.

305
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:56,164
Rym: Yup.

306
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,864
Scott: I've never seen him at a convention ever.

307
00:15:59,211 --> 00:15:59,569
Scott: In ever.

308
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:05,530
Rym: I would go, but I really don't like Comic-Cons anymore.

309
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:05,679
Scott: Right.

310
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,440
Rym: At all.

311
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:08,385
Scott: Yeah, I mean...

312
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,710
Rym: Like it's not worth it to have to go over there.

313
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:12,689
Rym: It's right there.

314
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:16,590
Rym: The subway stops in front of our apartment building.

315
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:17,124
Scott: Yup.

316
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,050
Scott: Anyway, just saying.

317
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:19,322
Scott: Yeah.

318
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,049
Scott: That's a pretty awesome, high quality guest right there.

319
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,965
Rym: Also, I point out that when we went to see Makoto Shinkai, and we went to the big Q&A...

320
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,890
Scott: We went Sunday morning, we saw the screening, and we left.

321
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,770
Rym: The room was full.

322
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,350
Rym: People lined up crazily to see him, which was really cool.

323
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,308
Rym: People were really into it.

324
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,670
Rym: Take a note, Otakon, Katsu-Kon, all the other anime-cons.

325
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,830
Rym: The Comic-Cons actually get people to line up for the anime guests.

326
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:40,381
Scott: Yeah.

327
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:41,990
Scott: Tamino had a huge line.

328
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,509
Scott: He filled the room.

329
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,630
Rym: Yeah, a lot of people got turned away.

330
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,250
Rym: And the room was full, but I remember, and I have a video I'll link to, but I videoed the whole interview.

331
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:48,888
Rym: You want to know why?

332
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,330
Rym: Because I realized that, other than me, no one in the room was press.

333
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,910
Rym: No one was covering that at all.

334
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,310
Rym: I think I actually got the only video and audio of that panel.

335
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,169
Rym: And almost no one watched it online, so I guess that's why.

336
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,388
Rym: So, things of the day.

337
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,030
Rym: Got a thing of the day.

338
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:16,670
Scott: I might have a thing of the day.

339
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,969
Scott: So, this should be a Tuesday thing of the day, but whatevs.

340
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:24,650
Scott: Here are, you know Crokinole, PAX East final game.

341
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,530
Rym: One of the better Omegathon finales they've ever had.

342
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:34,705
Scott: Here is the World Crokinole Championships of 2012 final round.

343
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:38,829
Scott: It's incredible.

344
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,210
Rym: It's pretty amazing.

345
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,709
Scott: It's exactly what you'd expect.

346
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,668
Rym: I guess, imagine a bowling tournament, and they're keeping track of the score in terms of how many 300s you got in a row.

347
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,642
Scott: It's like, you know how you bowl, and you get 100 something maybe, and if you're really good, 200 something.

348
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:56,890
Scott: But, you watch pro guys, and it's rare they don't get a strike.

349
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,090
Scott: Well, pro Crokinole is pretty the same.

350
00:17:59,250 --> 00:17:59,769
Scott: It's up.

351
00:18:00,273 --> 00:18:00,488
Rym: Total.

352
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:01,564
Rym: Total.

353
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:05,870
Scott: It's ridiculous.

354
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,010
Rym: It's pretty amazing.

355
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:13,270
Scott: These guys must have sat in their houses for weeks, just constantly flicking it into the 20 over and over and over again.

356
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,969
Rym: That circle there, that Crokinole place, is a place I will never be.

357
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:17,950
Rym: I like Crokinole.

358
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:20,170
Rym: I really want to play Crokinole.

359
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,050
Rym: Could probably get a table for Crokinole.

360
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:29,846
Rym: Crokinole was moderately big at RIT, like weirdly, but these guys are too far beyond me.

361
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:30,888
Rym: I'm 100 years too soon.

362
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,670
Scott: If only I could be as good at air hockey as they are at Crokinole.

363
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:43,062
Rym: You know, if we could just find someone who's willing to host an air hockey table, I'd be willing to split one 50/50 with you.

364
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:48,582
Rym: However, person, theoretical person, one, you'd have to live within subway access of us.

365
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:52,970
Rym: Two, let us come over to your house at any hour of any day.

366
00:18:53,070 --> 00:19:01,061
Rym: Just give us keys so we can play air hockey, but otherwise- Not be bothered by the noise of the air compressor and clack, clack, clack, ding, clack, clack, ding.

367
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,578
Rym: You got to keep that shit waxed, but if you do that, we will provide you with a brand new regulation.

368
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:07,810
Rym: photon air hockey table.

369
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:09,709
Rym: I'm kind of serious.

370
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,429
Scott: Oh, and if we ever move somewhere, we're taking that shit.

371
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,448
Rym: Yeah, or you have to move alongside us.

372
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,090
Rym: If we move to Seattle, well, guess where you're moving.

373
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,570
Rym: Either you or the table.

374
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:22,770
Scott: Well, you and the table or just the table.

375
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,570
Rym: Yeah, pretty much all I care about is the table.

376
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:32,364
Rym: My thing of the day, this was tweeted a while ago, and I think I talked about it, but I don't think I really talked about it too deeply.

377
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:32,910
Rym: on GeekNights.

378
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:38,087
Rym: We've been watching the new Sailor Moon and- Ashokio?

379
00:19:38,805 --> 00:19:39,010
Rym: Yeah.

380
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:45,610
Rym: A tuxedo mask was kind of a shitty dresser, and I never- Did he wear a fucking tuxedo?

381
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,730
Scott: How could he be shitty at dressing?

382
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,890
Scott: Yeah, so in the old anime- There is no dressing that is less shitty than a tuxedo.

383
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:54,170
Rym: He is usually not wearing the tuxedo.

384
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,230
Rym: He's wearing an oversized shirt that's buttoned the wrong way.

385
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,649
Scott: Well, that's not tuxedo mask.

386
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:00,270
Rym: Oh, spoilers.

387
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:01,528
Rym: That's not him.

388
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:04,310
Rym: My blood turns me into this guy.

389
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:10,790
Rym: So, that aside, in the new one, he is just wearing the tuxedo all the time.

390
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,330
Scott: And it's not just a regular tuxedo.

391
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,749
Scott: It's a fucking Dracula tuxedo with a medallion thingy.

392
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:20,210
Rym: Yeah, and as our good friend Onorobo posted, it is a broken tuxedo.

393
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:27,448
Rym: She posted this picture that is basically a teardown of how incorrectly designed this tuxedo is.

394
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:34,829
Rym: So, if you cosplay as tuxedo mask, you're wearing a tuxedo that anyone who knows about tuxedos will slap you over.

395
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:37,250
Rym: One, lose collar.

396
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,770
Rym: Two, bow tie should be plump and sit in front of the wing tips.

397
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,369
Rym: Three, white tie never has a pleated bosom.

398
00:20:44,052 --> 00:20:46,030
Rym: Four, cannot stress this enough.

399
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:52,566
Rym: Never, never, never, never wear nosh lapels with a tuxedo, especially not a white tie tuxedo.

400
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:55,629
Rym: The shit is egregious.

401
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,949
Scott: I don't know anything about fashions.

402
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,588
Scott: Especially not any of that.

403
00:20:59,973 --> 00:21:01,690
Rym: Vest should never be longer than the jacket.

404
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:09,830
Rym: Oh, and the sleeve should be the same length because in Sailor Moon, his left sleeve appears to go all the way down to the floor.

405
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,390
Rym: I think that's just an animation error, but still.

406
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,950
Scott: Well, I mean, the show is already poorly drawn.

407
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,210
Scott: This is an example of the kind of not attention to detail, right?

408
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,550
Scott: I wonder, though, how many shows are well drawn, right?

409
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:28,890
Scott: But still have that kind of mistake in it, but no one bothers to look that closely and point it out because the show is well drawn.

410
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:30,230
Rym: You know what my opinion is?

411
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,966
Rym: Every anime that's ever had a horse in it.

412
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:35,750
Rym: Seriously, go back and look at horses in anime.

413
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,868
Rym: They're the fucking worst.

414
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:44,590
Rym: Ohno went one step further and drew a corrected version of the tuxedo.

415
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,107
Rym: You know what?

416
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:51,930
Rym: Even if you don't understand all the nine points of why this tuxedo is wrong, look at the pictures and that shit becomes apparent.

417
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,370
Rym: And you will now feel like a tuxedo expert.

418
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,449
Scott: I can't see the picture.

419
00:21:55,832 --> 00:22:00,888
Rym: And the next time you see a person wearing a tuxedo and the vest is longer than the jacket, you can slap them.

420
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:01,441
Scott: Whoa.

421
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,350
Scott: That sleeve goes all the way to the grass.

422
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:03,988
Scott: Yeah, it does.

423
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,850
Scott: It's definitely longer than the other sleeve.

424
00:22:08,571 --> 00:22:12,990
Rym: But this is why I'm not digging the new tuxedo mask or even the new Sailor Moon.

425
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:18,529
Rym: It reeks of lazy cash grab and I'm really not feeling like it's going to be remembered for the ages.

426
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:21,090
Rym: There's a reason the old Sailor Moon is remembered.

427
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,050
Rym: It's not the best show.

428
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,830
Scott: It's more like a mandatory anniversary activity.

429
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:25,510
Scott: Yeah.

430
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:28,810
Scott: It's like, oh, something is an arbitrary number of years old.

431
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,990
Scott: We have to do something.

432
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,170
Rym: So in the meta moment, the Book Club book is a canticle for Leibowitz.

433
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,749
Rym: I imagine Scott will read it on the flights to and from PAX.

434
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:36,450
Scott: Maybe.

435
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:36,970
Rym: Maybe.

436
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,090
Rym: Or he's just going to play video games.

437
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,250
Scott: I charge my Kindle.

438
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:40,202
Rym: No.

439
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:41,348
Scott: That's a step.

440
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,020
Rym: Yeah.

441
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:46,189
Rym: I stopped reading temporarily, so I'm only five novels ahead of you.

442
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:46,930
Scott: Okay.

443
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:55,969
Rym: But started reading the non-culture Enum Banks fiction because I'm kind of at odds with the fact that there's no more culture books.

444
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,950
Rym: Might have to turn to fan fiction.

445
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,970
Rym: Luke Burrage promised he would write me culture fan fiction.

446
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:03,668
Rym: So if that actually happens, I will read it.

447
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:10,730
Scott: The more important meta moment, do you want to go to the aforementioned PAX Prime?

448
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:19,170
Scott: Are you able to get there and have a place to stay there, but are you also lacking a ticket because they are sold the fuck out?

449
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,850
Rym: They were unsold out today and then were sold out again.

450
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:22,390
Scott: Right.

451
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:30,409
Scott: So now you have no chance to get one other than stealing one, buying one from scalpers, or winning one from someone like us.

452
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:31,130
Rym: Oh yeah.

453
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,950
Scott: I bought four tickets, but our panel was accepted.

454
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,559
Scott: There was a chance.

455
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,007
Scott: it wouldn't be.

456
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,710
Rym: We're not going to risk that shit.

457
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:39,082
Rym: Yeah.

458
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,230
Scott: We can't risk our panel not being accepted.

459
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,649
Scott: We have to guarantee that we're going to get in.

460
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,528
Scott: So I bought four tickets.

461
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:45,928
Scott: We need one of them because Emily wants it.

462
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:50,571
Scott: And the other one I have to sell because Jesus Christ, these things are $110.

463
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:51,449
Scott: I got to get some money back.

464
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:51,790
Rym: Yeah.

465
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,049
Rym: Also girl who complained about how expensive Connecticut badges are.

466
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:56,709
Scott: 110 bucks, four days of packs.

467
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:02,050
Scott: The other two, we're going to give away to one lucky person.

468
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:05,309
Scott: If you want to be that lucky person, here's what you have to do.

469
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:10,190
Scott: You have to help promote GeekNights because we're not, we got to get something for this, right?

470
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:16,149
Scott: We're not going to lie about it being like, no, this is not a shameless, it's a shameless promotion.

471
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,550
Rym: You guys know, you guys are the hardcore listeners, most of our fans don't listen.

472
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:20,138
Rym: Pax is growing.

473
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,130
Scott: GeekNights is not growing.

474
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,190
Scott: You help grow GeekNights.

475
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,590
Scott: We'll get you to Pax, right?

476
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,210
Scott: So here's what you do.

477
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:25,789
Scott: You got to tweet.

478
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:28,449
Scott: We're going to stick it to Twitter only because that's easy for us.

479
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:33,890
Scott: You make a tweet, your tweet must contain a link to some sort of GeekNights content.

480
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,030
Scott: It may be a podcast episode.

481
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:41,790
Scott: It might be, um, you know, a video we put on YouTube, some sort of GeekNights content.

482
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:49,567
Scott: Your tweet must also contain the hashtag PAX for Pax so that when people search for the on Twitter, they'll see it.

483
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,324
Scott: It must contain a hashtag of GeekNights or at GeekNights so that it's easy for us to see it.

484
00:24:54,631 --> 00:25:06,450
Scott: And so people can, you know, you're spreading the brand of GeekNights, but if you use at GeekNights, do not make that the very first thing in your tweet, because then only we will see that tweet and other people who follow us who also follow you, which is almost nobody.

485
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:07,368
Scott: So that won't count.

486
00:25:08,851 --> 00:25:14,849
Scott: And three, you must tweet it before I give the tickets away, which will probably be very soon after I received them in the mail.

487
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:22,990
Scott: And we will randomly select one person who made such a tweet and send them the tickets in the mail after I direct message to them on Twitter and get their address.

488
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,724
Scott: If you tweet many times, thank you, but I'm only going to put you in the random selector once.

489
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,950
Rym: However, unrelatedly, if some of our videos are taken off more, we'll do more.

490
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,630
Rym: I mean, you guys, I hope are following our GeekNights presents.

491
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:45,830
Rym: Show Joe Kakumei, you tennis show, which seems moderately popular, but could be more popular if it were, say, in order of magnitude more popular.

492
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,870
Rym: We would do a lot more episodes in a fucking hurry.

493
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,490
Rym: So all that aside, we're going to be at PAX and we're going to be presenting our panel.

494
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,650
Rym: The panel is titled How to Win Every Game.

495
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:00,610
Rym: Every game.

496
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,510
Rym: It's on Monday at noon.

497
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,630
Rym: I think the Sandworm Theater.

498
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:05,550
Scott: And I feel like they're putting all the fan panels on Mondays.

499
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:06,730
Rym: Yeah, we'll see.

500
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,610
Rym: We'll look at the cramming us all into the Monday.

501
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:08,979
Rym: Yep.

502
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:11,450
Rym: But we're not joking.

503
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:14,467
Rym: We'll literally tell you how to win every game that you'll ever play in your life.

504
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:19,390
Rym: You might not want to do the things we suggest, but then you don't get to win.

505
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,230
Scott: That's not what it is.

506
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,028
Scott: That's what it takes to win.

507
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:22,030
Scott: Do you want to win?

508
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:24,710
Rym: Do you want to listen to Herm Edwards or not?

509
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:28,310
Rym: So special attacks.

510
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,830
Scott: So we were having trouble.

511
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:36,208
Scott: Actually, I had a zillion show ideas and I said and Rym was like, oh, those are all kind of OK show ideas.

512
00:26:37,272 --> 00:26:37,990
Scott: Let's pick one.

513
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:43,450
Scott: And this is the run Rym picked is do the link bait garbage show of top ten something.

514
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,870
Scott: So Rym was just like top ten villains.

515
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,750
Scott: And I'm like, that's just lame and generic.

516
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:49,510
Scott: You have to make it top ten something interesting.

517
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,650
Scott: And I was thinking like top ten anime animal companions.

518
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,070
Rym: Name ten anime animal companions.

519
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,849
Scott: I can easily do that.

520
00:26:57,191 --> 00:27:00,909
Scott: These aren't my top ten, but I'm just going to name ten because you challenge me.

521
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:01,905
Scott: Their name?

522
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:05,129
Scott: All right.

523
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,369
Rym: Well, you say the moon cats.

524
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,430
Rym: Can you get Luna?

525
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:07,845
Scott: Yeah.

526
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:09,478
Rym: Not you, Diana.

527
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,388
Rym: I guess you get Luna and Choo Choo.

528
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:14,967
Scott: The yellow thing from Full Metal Panic from I don't know the name of that.

529
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:21,250
Scott: And OK, Candy Candy's little raccoon band.

530
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:25,350
Scott: OK, Haro, the robot thingy from.

531
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,086
Rym: Is that an animal?

532
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:27,470
Scott: It's a robot Gundam.

533
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:27,830
Scott: Yes.

534
00:27:28,091 --> 00:27:28,709
Scott: It's an account.

535
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,190
Rym: So wait.

536
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:30,690
Rym: So is that an animal?

537
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:30,967
Rym: Yes.

538
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:31,970
Rym: It's a robot Gundam.

539
00:27:32,112 --> 00:27:32,305
Rym: Yes.

540
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:34,680
Scott: It's a. it's a robot in the Gundam universe.

541
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,968
Rym: cheating because then Tori counts to Tori Done.

542
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:37,690
Rym: All right.

543
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:37,888
Rym: Great.

544
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:38,547
Rym: You're up to four.

545
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,409
Rym: Congratulations.

546
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:39,824
Scott: Pikachu.

547
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:41,910
Rym: Pokemon.

548
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,269
Scott: That's the only Pokemon that counts.

549
00:27:43,717 --> 00:27:43,802
Rym: OK.

550
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:44,687
Rym: I was about to say.

551
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,810
Scott: It's the only Pokemon that counts.

552
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,050
Rym: All Pokemon are just ditto anyways.

553
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:48,429
Scott: Cubay.

554
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,570
Rym: Is he an animal companion?

555
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:51,650
Rym: Is he an animal?

556
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:52,206
Scott: Yes.

557
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:52,781
Scott: OK.

558
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:53,869
Rym: You're up to six then.

559
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:54,566
Scott: All right.

560
00:27:55,334 --> 00:27:56,890
Scott: I can definitely finish this if you give me enough time.

561
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:58,028
Rym: Pressure's on.

562
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,468
Scott: Pressure's on to finish this.

563
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:02,489
Scott: Oh.

564
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:02,950
Scott: Oh.

565
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:03,520
Scott: Oh.

566
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:04,829
Scott: You don't know his name.

567
00:28:05,036 --> 00:28:05,390
Scott: Pen-Pen.

568
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:06,569
Rym: Pen-Pen counts.

569
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,043
Scott: Pen-Pen.

570
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,230
Rym: Pen-Pen definitely counts.

571
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,508
Scott: Pen-Pen is probably the best one.

572
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,279
Rym: Yeah.

573
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,648
Rym: Because his moral the moral of Pen-Pen is don't worry about it.

574
00:28:14,672 --> 00:28:15,026
Scott: Marilu.

575
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:16,542
Rym: Uh.

576
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:18,790
Rym: Marilu does not count.

577
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:19,727
Scott: No, you don't think so?

578
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:20,206
Rym: No.

579
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:24,750
Scott: The Cat Armor from El Hazzard doesn't have a name other than Cat Armor.

580
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:26,450
Rym: What is it called?

581
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,150
Rym: Cat Armor.

582
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,690
Scott: Its name is Cat Armor.

583
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:32,289
Rym: All right.

584
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:33,226
Rym: Provisional.

585
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:33,981
Scott: Provisional.

586
00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:35,646
Scott: Um.

587
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,888
Rym: Still need another one.

588
00:28:39,393 --> 00:28:40,469
Scott: Does Mahotsukai-tai have one?

589
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:41,288
Rym: Does it?

590
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:42,327
Scott: I don't think so.

591
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:48,290
Rym: The wand does not count despite having a duck or in one instance a horse on it.

592
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:51,953
Scott: Uh.

593
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:53,430
Scott: So are we doing a top ten list?

594
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:54,530
Scott: Um.

595
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:56,410
Rym: Oh.

596
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:58,050
Rym: You don't know his name.

597
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,568
Scott: Kokuo-go.

598
00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,888
Scott: Which is Rao's horse.

599
00:29:01,454 --> 00:29:02,390
Scott: That's an animal companion.

600
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:02,705
Rym: Yes.

601
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,689
Rym: Yes, that counts.

602
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,310
Scott: All right.

603
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:04,885
Scott: We're getting there.

604
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,708
Rym: All right.

605
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,790
Scott: Do you really want me to finish this whole thing?

606
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,610
Rym: I think you got it enough.

607
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,368
Scott: You think I can make it?

608
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:10,008
Scott: If you give me enough time I can make it.

609
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:14,230
Rym: So what constitutes- The mice from Voltron.

610
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:16,129
Rym: A special attack.

611
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:19,270
Scott: Oh, I mean I'm pretty liberal in what counts as a special attack.

612
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,990
Rym: Because I mean there's obvious ones like the Big O Punch is a special attack.

613
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,410
Scott: Someone looking at my list, you know?

614
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:24,682
Rym: Yeah.

615
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,120
Rym: Yeah.

616
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:25,566
Rym: Yeah.

617
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,929
Rym: You got Dragon Slave and Giga Slave on there too?

618
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:29,025
Scott: Maybe.

619
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,410
Rym: Do you have them both?

620
00:29:30,918 --> 00:29:31,066
Scott: No.

621
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:31,510
Rym: No.

622
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:32,610
Rym: Did you forget Giga Slave?

623
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:32,894
Scott: No.

624
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,770
Rym: Because if you had Dragon Slave and not Giga Slave, get the fuck out.

625
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:35,893
Rym: No.

626
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,350
Scott: We'll talk about that later.

627
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:37,830
Rym: Okay.

628
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:38,590
Scott: Right.

629
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,650
Scott: So I mean every, like people have super powers, right?

630
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:43,350
Scott: In fiction.

631
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,930
Scott: Especially animes and comics and things, right?

632
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:46,668
Rym: Fuji Sawa Kick.

633
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:47,290
Scott: Right.

634
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:47,809
Scott: Exactly.

635
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,570
Scott: But like Superman's super strength is not a special attack.

636
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,769
Scott: He doesn't like announce, "I'm going to punch," and then have a special punch that he repeats, right?

637
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,050
Scott: Like Cyclops shoots people with eye lasers, right?

638
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,249
Scott: But only in the X-Men arcade game does he actually do it in the form- I was about to say that counts.

639
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:11,870
Scott: Only in the X-Men arcade game does he actually do it in the form of a special attack where he says, "Optic blast," and pew.

640
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,090
Rym: So it is a special attack in that case.

641
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:18,610
Scott: In that game, it is a special attack, but in the comic books, it's never a special attack.

642
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,610
Scott: He just shoots everywhere.

643
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,844
Rym: But then another, "I hit you now, you little

644
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:22,187
Rym: guy.".

645
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:23,150
Scott: Right.

646
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:30,069
Scott: So to be a special attack, it has to be a move, an offensive maneuver, I guess it could be defensive, right?

647
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,570
Scott: But it has to have a specifically, it has to have a name, right?

648
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:34,910
Scott: A canon name.

649
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,409
Rym: So it can't just be like Galactus being what he is.

650
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,090
Scott: Yeah, like Galactus eats a world.

651
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:44,420
Scott: Well, if Galactus said, "I eat a world," and then does it, it's like, "Oh, Galactus did 'I eat a

652
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:44,767
Scott: world.'".

653
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:53,470
Scott: It's like every Pokemon actually sort of has a whole bunch of special attacks because it's like, "Javar Dost used Hyper Beam," right?

654
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:55,905
Scott: It's like, "Well, I guess Hyper Beam's a special

655
00:30:55,925 --> 00:30:56,348
Scott: attack.".

656
00:30:57,053 --> 00:31:01,330
Scott: In fact, it's affected by the special attack stats, so it's- Now I'm just thinking of Pokemon Rusty.

657
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:14,350
Scott: Use Drank- So it's like if it has a name and it's a maneuver, then it becomes, it gets elevated beyond just general power to special attack.

658
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,490
Rym: I do have one edge case that I'm curious what your thoughts are.

659
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:17,928
Scott: All right.

660
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:21,808
Rym: So One Punch Man doesn't say, "I'm doing the one

661
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:22,230
Rym: punch."

662
00:31:22,712 --> 00:31:23,110
Rym: That's true.

663
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,370
Rym: But One Punch Man has one move, and it fits all the other definitions of move.

664
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:30,310
Scott: It's so ridiculously strong.

665
00:31:30,592 --> 00:31:31,090
Rym: I think it counts.

666
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,490
Scott: And I don't want to disrespect such an ultimate punch.

667
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:42,710
Scott: I actually give it more respect than most other attacks, but I don't, it doesn't come in the form of really a special attack so much.

668
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,907
Scott: It doesn't have a name.

669
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,189
Rym: The way it's presented, if you just pencil in- Every time.

670
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,609
Scott: It's just, he punches, right?

671
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:54,907
Scott: It's not like he does it in the same way every time, like, "Here we go, I'm doing the

672
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:55,268
Scott: punch."

673
00:31:55,854 --> 00:31:56,125
Scott: Right?

674
00:31:57,591 --> 00:31:57,986
Scott: All right.

675
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,348
Rym: All right.

676
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,570
Scott: It's just, he punches.

677
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:04,270
Rym: Meanwhile, big O, you get that stock animation of all those pistons gearing up.

678
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:04,809
Scott: Exactly.

679
00:32:05,112 --> 00:32:06,188
Scott: Same move every time.

680
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,410
Scott: It's Showtime.

681
00:32:08,631 --> 00:32:09,390
Scott: It has a name, Showtime.

682
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:09,847
Rym: Yeah.

683
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:10,987
Rym: All right.

684
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:13,989
Scott: So- So I just want to preface this, right?

685
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:16,609
Scott: I put this list together like two minutes before the show.

686
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:18,449
Rym: I put my list together like just now.

687
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,810
Scott: I probably forgot a whole bunch of great attacks that probably deserve to be higher on this list than everything I put on this list.

688
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,870
Scott: Let's start- So this is in no way definitive.

689
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:30,290
Scott: And if you tell me about something I forgot, you are probably right.

690
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,918
Scott: So- But I just, I thought up as many as I could and then ordered them in a mini tournament in my head.

691
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:36,528
Scott: and then we're going to go.

692
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,010
Rym: So this isn't necessarily the most powerful attack because it's very contextual.

693
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:44,910
Rym: However, Toga's ability to summon that car, I think counts.

694
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:45,930
Scott: What's the name of that attack?

695
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,868
Rym: Do you hear it?

696
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,787
Scott: That is correct.

697
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,049
Rym: Prowling around the ends of the world.

698
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:53,308
Rym: Do you hear it?

699
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:54,829
Rym: And then you hear the car in the distance.

700
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:01,159
Rym: And it even has, I feel like there's a most media that are long running- Why would you choose that?

701
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,530
Scott: and not just like Power of Dios?

702
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:04,230
Rym: That's also a power.

703
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,290
Rym: I'm much, I prefer Toga's power.

704
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:08,289
Scott: You would.

705
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,047
Rym: Sweet car.

706
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:09,548
Rym: You would.

707
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,050
Rym: Also, usually there's a side thing with these special attacks.

708
00:33:13,331 --> 00:33:28,950
Rym: There's usually the mold breaker episode where either someone else uses the special attack, like in Hokuto, uh, or when Sailor V pretends to be Sailor Moon and says that Tsukini Kawate Oshiokyo's speech.

709
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,029
Scott: I got to get to that episode.

710
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,450
Rym: That's like 40, that's so many episodes away from where you are now.

711
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,067
Scott: I'll get there.

712
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,729
Scott: It's where, now I got something to look forward to.

713
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,270
Rym: You haven't even met Sailor Venus yet.

714
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,430
Rym: She doesn't even know she's a Sailor Scout.

715
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,109
Scott: I saw her video game.

716
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,438
Scott: Yeah.

717
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:41,170
Scott: How does she not know?

718
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:42,810
Rym: It's complicated.

719
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:47,390
Rym: It's got the answer to any question you have about the Sailor Moon universe is it's complicated.

720
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:53,270
Rym: But there's always that moment.

721
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,070
Rym: And even in Utena, Toga does that move.

722
00:33:56,391 --> 00:34:02,050
Rym: But then there's an episode where Ruka is like doing my thing, I'm doing the Toga thing.

723
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:06,510
Rym: And then he turns and says, Toga, I believe it's your line.

724
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:10,190
Rym: And then he just appears out of this fountain and says the line.

725
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:12,530
Scott: Okay.

726
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,590
Scott: The last one on my list.

727
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,429
Scott: Do I actually have 10?

728
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,929
Scott: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

729
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:18,810
Scott: I have 12.

730
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,030
Scott: Fuck you.

731
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,889
Scott: I'm doing all 12.

732
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,409
Rym: That's whatever.

733
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,050
Scott: Number 12.

734
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:22,989
Scott: Pime stole your eyeball.

735
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:23,630
Rym: Oh my God.

736
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,188
Rym: That is, what do you remember the name of that?

737
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:27,389
Rym: The eyeball snatch.

738
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:27,980
Rym: Yeah.

739
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:30,690
Scott: That's his special move.

740
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,529
Scott: He snatches your eyeball right out of your face.

741
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:38,440
Rym: That power, that special attack might've been so powerful that I think it was the first YTMND.

742
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:42,870
Scott: It was the first YTMND I give a shit about and probably the last one I gave a shit about.

743
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:57,690
Rym: I mean, obviously the first YTMND was YTMND, but I think Pime Stole Your Eyeball outlived YTMND and I think it was the first one that people like noticed out in the wild.

744
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,470
Scott: But just snatching someone's eyeball out of their face.

745
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:01,530
Scott: That's incredible.

746
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:01,803
Scott: Yeah.

747
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,568
Rym: Especially doing it twice to the same person.

748
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:09,529
Rym: Though the five point palm heart, whatever that was.

749
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,910
Scott: That's probably the strongest.

750
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:13,830
Scott: See, the best attacks are not necessarily the strongest.

751
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,690
Rym: That's not the strongest or the best.

752
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,009
Rym: The five point one is just cool.

753
00:35:18,232 --> 00:35:19,450
Scott: I think that's probably the strongest.

754
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,669
Rym: It's not nearly as strong as just shoot him.

755
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:22,490
Scott: Okay.

756
00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:22,787
Scott: Sure.

757
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:23,307
Scott: Yeah.

758
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,110
Scott: Anyway.

759
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:27,690
Scott: But that's not a special attack.

760
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,181
Scott: Just shoot him.

761
00:35:28,713 --> 00:35:30,107
Rym: Unless you say something while you shoot him.

762
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,410
Rym: You're supposed to be like Gun Guy in a fighting game.

763
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,348
Rym: The one guy who has a gun.

764
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:39,789
Rym: So write down, because I already mentioned Big O's Punch, but I don't think you guys, if you haven't watched Big O, really appreciate it.

765
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,009
Scott: Crossing off Big O's Punch on my list.

766
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:49,070
Rym: I think it's the greatest punch ever animated to be delivered by a robot in human history.

767
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,890
Rym: Name a better animated robot delivering a punch.

768
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:58,129
Scott: Well, I mean, on my list coming up soon is also Roqueta Punchy.

769
00:35:58,451 --> 00:35:59,249
Rym: That's pretty cool.

770
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:02,930
Scott: But it's not, it's not, I don't know, it's not stronger or necessarily better.

771
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,409
Scott: Did I rank it better?

772
00:36:06,055 --> 00:36:06,867
Scott: Where did I put it?

773
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,770
Rym: Mine are in no particular order.

774
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:09,709
Scott: Oh, okay.

775
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:15,108
Scott: So then mine are also in no particular order except for the ones I'm going to say are in a better order.

776
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,510
Scott: But it's like Rocket Punch is, it's cooler, I think, because it's flying around.

777
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:23,030
Scott: It's a flying fist, which is amazing.

778
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:23,990
Rym: But that piston.

779
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,510
Scott: But it's not nearly as hard punching as the piston.

780
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:29,070
Scott: The piston is just like, boom, right?

781
00:36:29,873 --> 00:36:32,349
Scott: The impact is like 10 times as strong with the piston.

782
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:42,450
Scott: Showtime is way stronger than Rocket Punch, but Rocket Punch, it's just, when you see that fist flying in the air, it's just like, and it's in the theme song.

783
00:36:43,138 --> 00:36:43,408
Rym: It is.

784
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,050
Rym: That is true.

785
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,829
Scott: Showtime is not in the theme song of Big O.

786
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:53,150
Rym: So speaking of Big O, Batman's special attack would be his money, but he doesn't really call it out?

787
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,770
Scott: How does Batman even have special attacks?

788
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:58,510
Rym: Batman, you could argue that his special attack is common sense.

789
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,830
Scott: That's not a special attack.

790
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:00,223
Rym: I know.

791
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:01,930
Scott: Throw Batarang.

792
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,483
Rym: Yeah.

793
00:37:02,831 --> 00:37:04,070
Rym: Batarang, Batarang, Batarang.

794
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,130
Scott: No, Batman doesn't have anything.

795
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:06,630
Rym: Got nothing.

796
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,800
Scott: Anyway, so the next one I have here, right?

797
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,410
Scott: Hulk Hogan just body slamming somebody.

798
00:37:15,255 --> 00:37:16,830
Rym: Does he say something when he does it?

799
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:18,190
Scott: It's called a body slam.

800
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:20,270
Scott: It's specifically his special move.

801
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:22,588
Scott: Every pro wrestler has a special move and that's his.

802
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:24,890
Rym: But in those cases, they don't call them out.

803
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,727
Rym: They just do them.

804
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:27,770
Scott: They don't have to say them.

805
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,829
Scott: It just has to have a name.

806
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,570
Rym: And it also isn't always the same.

807
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,510
Rym: They tweak it slightly.

808
00:37:31,952 --> 00:37:33,045
Rym: So I think that's the same.

809
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,590
Scott: It's the same enough.

810
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,130
Scott: Pime doesn't say eyeball snatch when he snatches your eyeball, but it's a move with the name.

811
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,390
Rym: I think one punch man.

812
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,130
Scott: It's a named offensive maneuver.

813
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,549
Rym: That's one punch man's name.

814
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,930
Scott: But what's the name of that maneuver?

815
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:44,490
Rym: Punch.

816
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,550
Scott: No, it's not.

817
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,089
Rym: Body slam counts, but punch doesn't.

818
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:59,428
Scott: Just because the name of Hulk Hogan's special attack is not as fancy as other wrestlers who have things like sharpshooter or figure four leg lock or whatever, does not mean it is any less special.

819
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:04,150
Scott: Just picking someone up and slamming they ass on the ground.

820
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,210
Scott: In pro wrestling, it's like, okay, it's on a canvas or whatever.

821
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:13,850
Scott: But imagine going on the street and picking someone up over your head and just slamming them on the ground.

822
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:18,590
Rym: So how is that then different from Hagar's special move in the game?

823
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:20,229
Scott: Hagar's special move doesn't have a name.

824
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:22,229
Scott: It's not a signature move.

825
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:23,670
Rym: It's the pile driver.

826
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,570
Rym: It's his signature move.

827
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,907
Rym: That's the only move you fucking do.

828
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:30,470
Scott: You usually walk down the street punching people.

829
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,429
Rym: No, I do the pile driver over and over again.

830
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:34,989
Scott: Also Hagar is not Hulk Hogan.

831
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:38,230
Rym: Who would win in a fight, Hulk Hogan or Hagar?

832
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,010
Scott: Hagar.

833
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,230
Scott: Because Hagar could actually fight the fictional character if he was real.

834
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,670
Scott: Hulk Hogan just pretend fight it and use steroids.

835
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,570
Rym: Yeah, but what about the fictional character Hulk Hogan, the real American hero?

836
00:38:50,235 --> 00:38:52,410
Scott: Oh, well, it depends.

837
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,950
Rym: Real American hero versus Hagar.

838
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,450
Scott: Is it pro wrestling or is it a street fight?

839
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:01,523
Scott: Also are they in the town, which Hagar is mayor of, because they'll just have the cops show up.

840
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:02,450
Rym: All right, it's fine.

841
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,430
Rym: So we're in special moves.

842
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,450
Rym: Everything Sailor Scouts do is a special move.

843
00:39:06,715 --> 00:39:07,148
Scott: Pretty much.

844
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:07,950
Rym: By definition.

845
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:08,790
Scott: But none of them are real.

846
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,007
Scott: None of the ones that I know of.

847
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:18,670
Scott: They didn't make my list because the best one I know of is throw your tiara at them and they explode, which is pretty cool, but not cooler than any of these things.

848
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:21,190
Scott: It doesn't even beat snatching someone's eyeball out of their face.

849
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,110
Rym: Yeah, because you haven't seen it.

850
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,730
Rym: The good sailors.

851
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:23,190
Scott: I'm sure.

852
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:30,829
Scott: I believe you that later on is something ridiculously good because Sailor Saturn carries with her a weapon.

853
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,110
Rym: She has a bladed weapon that she can't sword.

854
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:34,568
Rym: No, a glaive.

855
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:35,123
Scott: OK.

856
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,848
Rym: The glaive has a name.

857
00:39:37,296 --> 00:39:37,649
Scott: All right.

858
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,249
Rym: The glaive's name is the silence glaive.

859
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:41,845
Scott: OK.

860
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,410
Rym: Because it silences the world.

861
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:45,150
Rym: All right.

862
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,328
Scott: So everyone has to shut the fuck up.

863
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,530
Scott: And listen to what she has to say.

864
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:59,430
Rym: She has multiple powers, but to use her primary power, she need merely invoke the silence glaive and strike it into the earth, thereby destroying everything.

865
00:39:59,890 --> 00:39:59,935
Scott: Oh.

866
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:01,310
Rym: Everything.

867
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:03,870
Rym: Bringing ruin to the world.

868
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:05,530
Scott: So it has a name, silence glaive?

869
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,887
Scott: The entire world.

870
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,745
Scott: So when she does this, she goes, "Silence

871
00:40:08,846 --> 00:40:09,290
Scott: glaive!".

872
00:40:09,655 --> 00:40:10,770
Rym: Well, I guess I could swell.

873
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:16,009
Rym: She never does that move in the show, but she did it historically and threatens to do it again.

874
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:16,786
Scott: Oh, OK.

875
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:17,724
Rym: Yeah.

876
00:40:18,295 --> 00:40:18,650
Scott: All right.

877
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,990
Rym: Now, she is the most powerful Sailor Scout.

878
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:22,930
Rym: And in the lore.

879
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:23,410
Scott: Yeah.

880
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,870
Scott: If you have a silence glaive, why don't they just take that shit away from her?

881
00:40:26,211 --> 00:40:26,549
Rym: You know what?

882
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:32,570
Rym: She was not supposed to be reborn with everybody else, but someone fucked up and she was reborn.

883
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,969
Rym: Also, when the moon kingdom in the past collapsed, I guess you haven't seen a lot of that yet.

884
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,184
Rym: Any of it?

885
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:43,348
Rym: She was the one who woke up and said, "Well, this is fucked," and destroyed the rest of it just because.

886
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:43,615
Rym: Yes.

887
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:48,690
Rym: She also has another power that basically is a insta-kill.

888
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,269
Rym: It's a guaranteed insta-kill, but it also kills her.

889
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:52,854
Scott: Oh.

890
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,489
Scott: Well, she probably uses that.

891
00:40:55,131 --> 00:40:55,466
Rym: Maybe.

892
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,470
Scott: Against the end boss.

893
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:56,796
Scott: Maybe.

894
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:57,378
Rym: Yeah.

895
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,729
Rym: Well, the end boss of which series?

896
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:04,528
Scott: Second to end boss of whatever series she- She's in S and she's also in S.T.A.R.S I guess it's in S.T.A.R.S.

897
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,346
Scott: that she uses it.

898
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:06,110
Scott: Yeah.

899
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:06,978
Scott: If S.T.A.R.S.

900
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:07,610
Scott: comes afterwards.

901
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:08,143
Rym: We'll see.

902
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,126
Scott: Spoilers.

903
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:10,010
Scott: I'm just guessing.

904
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:10,320
Scott: Yeah.

905
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,287
Scott: All right.

906
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:12,569
Scott: Going down my list.

907
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,410
Rym: Going down your list?

908
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:14,610
Scott: This has a name.

909
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,230
Scott: I know you were trying to go the superhero comic underwear pervert route.

910
00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:20,730
Scott: Here is something in the underwear pervert route.

911
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,203
Rym: Okay.

912
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:22,650
Scott: Fastball special.

913
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,230
Scott: Colossus picks up motherfucking Wolverine and throws him at you.

914
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:28,748
Rym: He does that more than once, too.

915
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:30,470
Scott: And it has a name, Fastball special.

916
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:34,008
Scott: They even say Fastball special in the comic when they do it.

917
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:39,086
Scott: Imagine you're standing there in a fight and you're already fighting with Wolverine and Colossus.

918
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,209
Scott: Already give up.

919
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,110
Scott: Yeah, you're already fighting.

920
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,107
Scott: Already give up.

921
00:41:43,192 --> 00:41:47,889
Scott: But no, they don't come running at you and cut you and punch you in the face with their bodies made of metal.

922
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:54,089
Scott: Colossus picks up Wolverine and throws him at you at a speed at which you can't possibly run away from.

923
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,310
Rym: That's adding insult to injury.

924
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:59,930
Rym: That's like shooting someone on the way down from their suicide jump out of a skyscraper.

925
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,950
Scott: It's like throwing a sword at someone like Nidhogg, right?

926
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,190
Scott: Except the sword is Wolverine with six pointy claws.

927
00:42:05,633 --> 00:42:06,569
Rym: I want that to be a game.

928
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:07,650
Scott: Right.

929
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:08,588
Scott: So there you go.

930
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,309
Scott: Don't you don't want to face that.

931
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:14,062
Rym: All right.

932
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:14,468
Rym: All right.

933
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,370
Rym: So in my hastily assembled list, because I guess we mentioned it before, Dragon Slave would be on the list because that is a favorite.

934
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:23,110
Scott: I have Dragon Slave way farther down my list.

935
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,330
Rym: Because Dragon Slave is way powerful.

936
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,188
Rym: I mean, that is the season ender.

937
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:29,969
Rym: That is the movie ender.

938
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:38,870
Rym: That is the well, I'm going to fuck everything up and it gets bonus points because it is drawn from the power of an evil god that she killed in the first season.

939
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,790
Rym: I guess she can still draw upon that power.

940
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,149
Rym: It is an evil spell.

941
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,390
Scott: But it fucking works and is used for non-evil.

942
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,310
Rym: Sometimes other people cast it, but I like it.

943
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:52,250
Rym: It's kind of like, if you know Meteo, why the fuck do you ever cast flare?

944
00:42:55,012 --> 00:42:56,204
Rym: Ultima, Ultima, Ultima, Ultima.

945
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,330
Rym: That's how I beat Final Fantasy 6.

946
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,490
Rym: But it pales in comparison before the Giga Slave, which I guess has the power.

947
00:43:05,034 --> 00:43:07,450
Scott: But it's less, it only happens like a handful of times.

948
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,470
Scott: It's not a signature move like Dragon Slave.

949
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,110
Rym: But the thing is, they have a similar name.

950
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:12,210
Rym: The Giga Slave is named.

951
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:12,928
Rym: She knows it.

952
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,970
Scott: We can put them together in the same bundle.

953
00:43:15,131 --> 00:43:15,748
Scott: I'll allow that.

954
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:19,810
Scott: But I think if you had to choose one, it's got to be the main Dragon Slave.

955
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:20,730
Rym: Well, it depends.

956
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,630
Rym: I mean, I guess we shouldn't spoil.

957
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,230
Scott: It's got a huge speech in front of it, right?

958
00:43:25,471 --> 00:43:26,490
Scott: So does the Giga Slave.

959
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,330
Scott: Yeah, but the Dragon Slave speech is iconic, right?

960
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:33,150
Scott: It's, you know, and then the explosion is just so ridiculously enormous.

961
00:43:33,932 --> 00:43:34,688
Rym: So is the Slayer's...

962
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,810
Scott: And it involves a dragon.

963
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:40,690
Rym: Is the Slayer's special attack truly just suddenly turned into a shounen fighting show?

964
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,510
Rym: that's weirdly serious and then break out of that mold randomly?

965
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:44,261
Scott: I don't know.

966
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:45,629
Scott: I don't know.

967
00:43:46,035 --> 00:43:46,246
Scott: All right.

968
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,450
Scott: So I don't know.

969
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,490
Scott: This one might even break my own rule.

970
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:51,039
Scott: Yeah.

971
00:43:51,451 --> 00:43:52,930
Scott: So it's half on my list.

972
00:43:52,971 --> 00:43:53,429
Rym: I got a bunch.

973
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:58,010
Rym: Like, for example, I'm not even going to talk about anything that happens in Madoka because everything I would say would be huge spoilers.

974
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:01,049
Scott: But pretty much whenever Goemon cuts something.

975
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:01,692
Rym: Ah.

976
00:44:02,637 --> 00:44:03,529
Scott: And you could call it.

977
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:11,270
Scott: He has, you know, he always says something like, I have cut a useless thing or I have drawn my sword in uselessly or something like that.

978
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:14,430
Rym: Oh, so if it's a move that has a catchphrase after the fact.

979
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,750
Scott: I mean, you know, it's like, does it have a real a true name?

980
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:21,610
Scott: You know, if someone says you want to disallow it, I'll say, OK, fine.

981
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,567
Scott: You can disallow it.

982
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,600
Rym: Because there's a lot of things that happen in Hokuto.

983
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,689
Rym: no Ken that mostly only get the after talk.

984
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:27,090
Rym: Right.

985
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:29,470
Scott: But it's like, dude, have you seen these Lupin movies?

986
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,010
Scott: Some of them are more ridiculous than others.

987
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,775
Scott: Usually he just cuts a door open or cuts a cave rock, you know, so they can get in the cave.

988
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:38,709
Scott: But like other times, I think doesn't he cut like a plane into multiple pieces?

989
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,037
Scott: He cuts like whole buildings.

990
00:44:41,077 --> 00:44:48,030
Scott: that like whenever he does it for something ridiculous, it's like dude just stood there with a sword, took the sword out, put it back in.

991
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:48,687
Scott: You didn't see it.

992
00:44:49,071 --> 00:44:52,350
Scott: And something ridiculously large is now chopped into a million pieces.

993
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:54,550
Scott: That's amazing.

994
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:59,090
Rym: I couldn't pick any particular move from Fist of the North Star.

995
00:44:59,601 --> 00:44:59,887
Scott: I could.

996
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:02,468
Rym: But while well, so I can it's next.

997
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:03,809
Scott: It's next on my list.

998
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,296
Rym: In fact, Hokuto, I can.

999
00:45:05,337 --> 00:45:08,250
Rym: it's just my favorite for obvious reasons.

1000
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,429
Scott: The most comedic for sure.

1001
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:09,809
Scott: Right.

1002
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:14,570
Scott: Hokuto, who can is the number one primary attack.

1003
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,289
Scott: Right.

1004
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:22,027
Rym: So you could easily put that one that has both the say the name of the attack and the say something after the attack.

1005
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:26,190
Scott: Well, he says that after every attack succeeds, but he doesn't.

1006
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:30,040
Scott: But I actually pick the secret end of Hokuto.

1007
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,067
Scott: no can attack Musotense, which is where.

1008
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:35,270
Scott: Right.

1009
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:40,909
Scott: And the reason I picked that is because, like you sort of get used to this in the North Star, you watch it a whole bunch.

1010
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:41,390
Scott: Right.

1011
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,830
Scott: And it's like you see these ridiculous attacks and you get used to them.

1012
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:46,150
Scott: It's like, oh, you're exploding.

1013
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:46,909
Scott: Right.

1014
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:54,970
Scott: But when you get to the end and as the attack uses only like two times or maybe three times, it's like, oh, shit, son.

1015
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,775
Scott: Right.

1016
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:01,549
Scott: And it gives you that, oh, shit, son feeling like, oh, my God, this move is even stronger.

1017
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:02,490
Scott: Right.

1018
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:09,289
Scott: He's been doing these ridiculous moves all this time, cramming some guy into a tiny grave, making people explode by just touching them.

1019
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:10,090
Scott: Right.

1020
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,070
Scott: Giving them ten seconds to think about their sins before they die.

1021
00:46:13,712 --> 00:46:16,670
Scott: And then this is the big guns compared to that.

1022
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:17,810
Scott: He didn't even know this one.

1023
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,009
Scott: He had to learn it from a secret way.

1024
00:46:20,682 --> 00:46:20,850
Scott: Right.

1025
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,529
Scott: And it was hard for Kencho to do it.

1026
00:46:23,397 --> 00:46:23,950
Scott: It's amazing.

1027
00:46:24,171 --> 00:46:33,768
Scott: No, it's that, you know, it's like when you see it go down, it's like, oh, you get the heebly jeeblies special mention, I think, for Ziza and Jotaro's black credit card.

1028
00:46:34,373 --> 00:46:36,130
Rym: That is a special attack, I would argue.

1029
00:46:36,652 --> 00:46:38,809
Rym: Maybe I think that is definitely a special attack.

1030
00:46:39,051 --> 00:46:41,490
Scott: OK, next on my list was Rocket Punch, which you already talked about.

1031
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:42,168
Rym: We talked about that.

1032
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,128
Scott: But after that, most of these are robots because robots are bigger and have better attacks.

1033
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,830
Rym: And also, I pretty much have a note here that says everything and kill la kill.

1034
00:46:50,717 --> 00:46:51,108
Scott: Yeah, sure.

1035
00:46:51,891 --> 00:46:52,270
Scott: Absolutely.

1036
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:52,623
Scott: Yeah.

1037
00:46:53,098 --> 00:46:53,710
Rym: What else can I say?

1038
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:59,190
Scott: But there's too many, you know, I guess it would be, you know, I guess there's any guy might get his his attack.

1039
00:46:59,591 --> 00:47:00,477
Scott: No, no, it would be.

1040
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:02,290
Scott: I've forgotten it already.

1041
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:08,169
Scott: You know, the the finishing, you know, the was it, you know, how can I not remember the name of it?

1042
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:09,849
Scott: I watched the show once and then I stopped.

1043
00:47:10,331 --> 00:47:13,130
Rym: Now, when they when they cut the thread out and he incorporates it into himself.

1044
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:14,168
Rym: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1045
00:47:14,351 --> 00:47:15,420
Scott: Anyway, why am I so?

1046
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,610
Scott: I'm feel so dumb anyway.

1047
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:21,070
Scott: No, Astro Boy has his butt machine gun specifically.

1048
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,869
Rym: He doesn't say anything when he uses it.

1049
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:29,249
Rym: It has a name, but machine gun, but he just like pops out like, yeah, my gun has a name doesn't give me make it my special attack.

1050
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,690
Scott: That's definitely a special tech.

1051
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,326
Scott: He uses it more rarely than anything else.

1052
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,449
Rym: So rarity suddenly matters.

1053
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:35,170
Scott: Yeah.

1054
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,128
Scott: That's what makes it more epic.

1055
00:47:36,775 --> 00:47:37,470
Rym: Oh, right.

1056
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,568
Scott: When it's rarely used.

1057
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,530
Scott: The same reason Musou Tensei is so great.

1058
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,429
Scott: It's rarely used.

1059
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:50,150
Scott: So speaking of rarity, Fluttershy's eye and it's fucking bullets coming out, killing people, Fluttershy's out of a little robot's butt is a named special attack.

1060
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:52,950
Rym: And it might be the second most powerful thing we've ever seen.

1061
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,030
Scott: I didn't even think of that one.

1062
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:54,989
Scott: That's an amazing choice.

1063
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,589
Rym: That was near the top of my list right here.

1064
00:47:56,732 --> 00:47:57,170
Scott: That's amazing.

1065
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,550
Scott: I was thinking like, oh, Sonic Rainboom.

1066
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,410
Rym: I was like, wait a minute, what could stop the Sonic Rainboom?

1067
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:05,870
Rym: Well, one, any alicorn to, uh, a math puzzle.

1068
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:06,459
Scott: Yeah.

1069
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,289
Rym: Rainbow Dash is not that smart.

1070
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:17,509
Scott: I guess you're not going to choose, you know, elements of harmony attack because they, they kind of, well, spoilers, I guess spoiler reasons why.

1071
00:48:18,056 --> 00:48:18,310
Scott: Yeah.

1072
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:19,730
Scott: Anyway, but yeah.

1073
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,349
Rym: I think Fluttershy's stare is the most iconic and powerful.

1074
00:48:22,772 --> 00:48:23,910
Scott: It's called the stare.

1075
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:25,610
Rym: Basic special attack.

1076
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:26,230
Scott: There you go.

1077
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,450
Rym: Because the alicorns just do general magicky, magicky.

1078
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:30,081
Scott: Mm hmm.

1079
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,269
Scott: Now some of those magics can be named.

1080
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,130
Rym: He doesn't have a special attack.

1081
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,890
Rym: It's just like magic, magic, magic, magic, magic.

1082
00:48:36,272 --> 00:48:36,630
Scott: Exactly.

1083
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,169
Scott: Gandalf does not have any special attacks that can be used.

1084
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:40,587
Scott: Uh, all right.

1085
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:42,046
Scott: Next.

1086
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:43,530
Scott: Oh, dragon sleep.

1087
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:44,010
Scott: Right.

1088
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:44,347
Rym: Yep.

1089
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,208
Rym: We talked about that.

1090
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,970
Scott: But what about some other dragons?

1091
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:52,329
Scott: Like Gogeta, just when he breathes fire, that's it.

1092
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:54,790
Rym: So what about being a friend to children?

1093
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,268
Scott: That's not a special attack, but you could, you could.

1094
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,550
Scott: Gamera has plenty of special attacks, right?

1095
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:05,468
Scott: But you know, like turning into a turtle shell and spinning around and rocketing and shit like that.

1096
00:49:06,081 --> 00:49:06,290
Scott: Right.

1097
00:49:06,871 --> 00:49:09,830
Scott: But Godzilla breath, he breathes radioactive fire.

1098
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,549
Rym: It's like, he doesn't yell like, Oh, Godzilla breath.

1099
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,510
Scott: It has a name.

1100
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,930
Scott: The name is Godzilla fire and radioactive breath.

1101
00:49:16,072 --> 00:49:17,329
Scott: It has a name for the attack.

1102
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,668
Scott: It's rarely used.

1103
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,110
Scott: It's signature attack, right?

1104
00:49:21,511 --> 00:49:23,270
Scott: And he brings out as like the finishing blow.

1105
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:31,622
Scott: It's like, he'll punch people all day and whip his tail at him and do all kinds of other stuff, but he won't breathe fire on him until it's like, all right, you made me do this.

1106
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:36,109
Scott: And then when he does it, everyone's just like, fuck yeah.

1107
00:49:37,471 --> 00:49:45,810
Rym: It's kind of old school in that the internet already forgot about it, but this used to be a big thing and I saw sidekicks in the theater.

1108
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:48,420
Rym: So Chuck Norris is roundhouse.

1109
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,270
Rym: kick is a special attack.

1110
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:53,050
Rym: It sure is actually incredibly powerful.

1111
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,350
Scott: Was that the one with the kid at asthma?

1112
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:55,507
Rym: Yes, it was.

1113
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,489
Scott: I saw that in the theater.

1114
00:49:57,255 --> 00:49:57,870
Scott: It was awful.

1115
00:49:58,956 --> 00:49:59,730
Rym: I remember the whole movie.

1116
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:06,269
Rym: I'm like, like I expected this movie to be about Chuck Norris and the whole movie is just this asthma kid having fantasies about being the thing is right.

1117
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,809
Scott: I didn't even think of that category until just now.

1118
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:12,050
Scott: But while you, you know, that's a valid special move.

1119
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:15,269
Scott: Bruce Lee one inch punch just kicks that way down the list.

1120
00:50:15,852 --> 00:50:18,489
Rym: Well, punches it sure way down the list.

1121
00:50:18,653 --> 00:50:18,907
Rym: Yes.

1122
00:50:19,652 --> 00:50:20,527
Scott: From only an inch away.

1123
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:28,269
Scott: Bruce Lee would hold his fist just an inch away from something and then punch it so ridiculously hard over that short distance.

1124
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:32,169
Rym: But Chuck Norris as the fictional character can destroy galaxies with his kick.

1125
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:32,948
Scott: Yes.

1126
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,090
Scott: But this is a real person doing that, right?

1127
00:50:35,531 --> 00:50:43,379
Scott: Probably, in fact, the Bruce Lee one inch punch is probably the most the strongest special attack.

1128
00:50:43,399 --> 00:50:44,630
Scott: that's actually fucking real.

1129
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,690
Scott: What else on earth even comes close to that?

1130
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,250
Scott: That's actually not fictional.

1131
00:50:48,431 --> 00:50:50,449
Rym: Do I name a nuclear weapon and then launch it?

1132
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:52,429
Scott: That that's not a special attack.

1133
00:50:52,952 --> 00:50:54,280
Rym: You don't know what it was.

1134
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,830
Rym: the next time the US goes all nuclear.

1135
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,848
Rym: We're like nuclear fire go and then we launch it.

1136
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,750
Scott: Maybe they just because you use it or not.

1137
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,349
Scott: You don't have to use it or not use it for it to be special attack.

1138
00:51:04,754 --> 00:51:06,210
Rym: No, right.

1139
00:51:06,753 --> 00:51:08,149
Scott: Just having the special attack.

1140
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:15,610
Rym: So back when I was taking Kung Fu at RIT, our Sifu was demonstrating that sort of thing and demonstrating the importance of stance.

1141
00:51:16,012 --> 00:51:18,590
Rym: And he would do a version of that where he would get it.

1142
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:23,990
Rym: I'd get in my stance and he'd come up, he'd stand next to me and he's hold his palm like an inch away from my chest.

1143
00:51:24,351 --> 00:51:29,532
Rym: And then he would open palm, punch me in the chest and push me off my feet and to the ground.

1144
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:34,309
Rym: I never wanted to get on his bad side.

1145
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:39,409
Scott: Usually people who are teaching martial arts are not going to hurt you.

1146
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:46,529
Scott: When's the last time you saw, you know, a jiu-jitsu instructor goes on rampage, strangles 30 to death.

1147
00:51:47,552 --> 00:51:50,190
Scott: Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen that ever and it never will happen either.

1148
00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:55,510
Scott: All right, next on my list, I'm getting running out of things on my list.

1149
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:59,191
Rym: My list ran out now, so I'm trying to come up with things to add to the list at the bottom.

1150
00:51:59,351 --> 00:52:05,633
Scott: Well, number two on my list, Voltron, the strongest robot ever form blazing sword.

1151
00:52:05,874 --> 00:52:09,350
Scott: They say form blazing sword and then they form a fucking sword.

1152
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:18,590
Scott: And when you're a kid, swords and a giant robot makes a sword out of the air and then and he doesn't use it often.

1153
00:52:18,994 --> 00:52:20,130
Scott: They don't use most of the time.

1154
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:20,754
Scott: They just punch.

1155
00:52:20,976 --> 00:52:23,050
Scott: They just form Voltron and punch the rubies to death.

1156
00:52:23,534 --> 00:52:23,777
Scott: Right.

1157
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:24,609
Scott: They don't need the sword.

1158
00:52:25,013 --> 00:52:26,829
Scott: They only bring out the sword when they have to.

1159
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:27,989
Scott: And it's like, oh, shit.

1160
00:52:28,591 --> 00:52:29,730
Scott: They're getting the sword this episode.

1161
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:30,494
Rym: Yes.

1162
00:52:31,038 --> 00:52:32,510
Scott: And then they cut that rubies down.

1163
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:34,212
Scott: So good.

1164
00:52:34,232 --> 00:52:36,179
Scott: I guess

1165
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:37,463
Rym: we go to the end of your list, end

1166
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:38,306
Scott: of my list, I mean,

1167
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:47,754
Rym: I got a lot of things I could throw out there, but I feel like every one of them would either minorly contested or is not nearly as powerful as even the dregs of our current list.

1168
00:52:47,996 --> 00:52:49,710
Scott: Well, the end of the list, obviously.

1169
00:52:50,131 --> 00:52:50,372
Scott: Right.

1170
00:52:50,694 --> 00:52:53,910
Scott: You want to go something that's so devastating.

1171
00:52:54,252 --> 00:52:54,493
Scott: Right.

1172
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:58,189
Scott: You want the biggest, most damaging possible attack you can think of.

1173
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:59,070
Rym: So Sailor Saturn.

1174
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,294
Scott: Well, no.

1175
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,850
Scott: Well, maybe I bet it's on par with that.

1176
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:03,151
Scott: Right.

1177
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:10,210
Scott: But you would go to things you would think in your mind, something like, you know, Death Star gun, but that that's not a special attack.

1178
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,669
Scott: That's just that's just this gun.

1179
00:53:12,152 --> 00:53:12,414
Scott: Right.

1180
00:53:12,778 --> 00:53:14,109
Scott: So you can't really pick that.

1181
00:53:14,512 --> 00:53:17,649
Scott: And there are other planet destroying type weapons out there.

1182
00:53:18,251 --> 00:53:18,532
Scott: Right.

1183
00:53:19,274 --> 00:53:20,840
Scott: But there's only one I could think of.

1184
00:53:21,262 --> 00:53:23,429
Scott: that is that strong that has a name.

1185
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:31,934
Scott: Geez, Space Battleship Yamato, the wave motion gun, it has a whole production whenever they shoot it.

1186
00:53:32,536 --> 00:53:40,232
Scott: It's so ridiculously dangerous that like they respect like they're shooting it and they just like respect it so fucking much because it's so dangerous.

1187
00:53:40,252 --> 00:53:48,726
Scott: That definitely beats out the lone greens or whatever guns from just the regular whatever guns on the Gundam white ship or whatever.

1188
00:53:50,734 --> 00:53:52,529
Scott: Yeah, they're just those are just whatever guns.

1189
00:53:52,871 --> 00:53:53,113
Scott: Right.

1190
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:56,111
Scott: And it's like they'll find a whole fleet of dudes like, all right, we're going to.

1191
00:53:56,131 --> 00:54:00,770
Scott: it's like the Macross has a main gun, but it's just like fire main gun.

1192
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,129
Scott: It's not like a special attack.

1193
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:06,629
Scott: The only special attack it has is transforming and the three shield thingy.

1194
00:54:07,031 --> 00:54:07,293
Scott: Right.

1195
00:54:07,816 --> 00:54:08,520
Scott: It doesn't have.

1196
00:54:08,922 --> 00:54:10,210
Scott: its gun isn't a special attack.

1197
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:11,289
Scott: It's just its main gun.

1198
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:12,071
Scott: Right.

1199
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:16,950
Scott: This is also the main gun, but like the production that goes into firing it.

1200
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:17,151
Scott: Right.

1201
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:24,850
Scott: The little thing opens with the targeting thing and the gun, the little handgun controller for it and the aim it and they got to charge it up.

1202
00:54:25,511 --> 00:54:27,548
Scott: And then it's like the amount of damage it does.

1203
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:35,228
Scott: It's and and they, you know, they yell out like, you know, wave motion gun fire whatever every single time.

1204
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:36,694
Scott: Oh, my God.

1205
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:40,250
Scott: It's like and every you know, it's like they fire pretty often.

1206
00:54:40,672 --> 00:54:45,401
Scott: It's not like it's rarely used like some other things, but it's not used in every single episode.

1207
00:54:45,421 --> 00:54:46,010
Scott: Right.

1208
00:54:46,452 --> 00:54:53,610
Scott: But it's like even though you've watched like so many episodes of this show, every time they fire, it gives you the heat.

1209
00:54:53,770 --> 00:55:01,170
Scott: Not like, you know, you know, hooked on a can had to wait to have to build up to a special attack at the very end to give you the heebly jeeblies.

1210
00:55:02,034 --> 00:55:03,149
Scott: This thing is so big.

1211
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:05,669
Scott: Every time they fire it is heebly jeeblies.

1212
00:55:06,432 --> 00:55:08,309
Scott: Every single every single time it works.

1213
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:09,375
Scott: Right.

1214
00:55:09,638 --> 00:55:10,328
Scott: Every single time.

1215
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:15,650
Rym: All right, so I guess now is where we leave it for you guys to post in the forum.

1216
00:55:16,052 --> 00:55:23,730
Scott: And yell at us for forgetting, oh, the super obvious thing and forgetting the name of the main attack and kill it like a dumbass.

1217
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:24,331
Rym: We're old.

1218
00:55:24,371 --> 00:55:24,753
Rym: That shows.

1219
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:31,089
Scott: So like last season, as soon as someone's I'm going to go see it right now and I'm going to hate myself.

1220
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:39,280
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

1221
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,438
Rym: Special thanks to D.J.

1222
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:44,440
Rym: Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1223
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,863
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew dot com for show notes, discussion, news and more.

1224
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:57,520
Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1225

1227
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,440
Scott: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
