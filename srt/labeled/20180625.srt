1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,287
Rym: It's Monday, June 25th 2018.

2
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:11,811
Rym: I'm Rip.

3
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:12,955
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,179
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,668
Rym: Tonight SQL and relational databases.

6
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:20,359
Rym: because in 13 years, I guess we never talked about this.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,418
Scott: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:29,977
Rym: So I think we got at least temporarily a new bit in the show.

9
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:31,845
Rym: in the beginning You know the format of GeekNights.

10
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:40,451
Rym: like we do our opening bit where we're like, oh, it's warm today rained on me I ate a taco last night and we do news Things that things of the day.

11
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:41,700
Rym: then we do our meta stuff.

12
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:50,345
Rym: Then we do the main show and then we do like the stinger nonsense I got a new bit the pub G moment because we just do we're gonna do Tuesday on pub G Might as well just hold it.

13
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:54,323
Rym: So I'm gonna just tell one pub G story because I've been playing a lot of pub G Uh-huh.

14
00:00:54,584 --> 00:01:00,839
Rym: So my story is how I indirectly killed a guy in a way That was so funny that I was laughing and because I was laughing someone else killed me.

15
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:07,660
Rym: So I started like the upper right corner of this map and the circle of course is as far away as possible.

16
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:08,423
Scott: Time to run.

17
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,080
Rym: Yep, and I'm at this like little tiny town that's on a road.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,648
Rym: There's no vehicles at all.

19
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,840
Rym: Like I figure there's no way to run there in time.

20
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:21,703
Rym: So I'm looking for a vehicle that I confirm there are no vehicles anywhere near me Except why.

21
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:34,540
Rym: so I decide to run toward this next little town and hope there's one there and if not I was just gonna die, but then I hear a noise and a dune buggy is driving from even further away Coming into town.

22
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:40,960
Rym: So I take a couple of potshots and this uh this individual instead of just driving by like a smart person.

23
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:44,896
Scott: Right because you'll die from the wall that you know, but they guess they want to get a kill.

24
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:49,939
Rym: Yep So, uh, they they stop and get out and start stalking me.

25
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,425
Scott: So the circle is coming.

26
00:01:53,626 --> 00:02:01,780
Rym: so I take a couple more potshots and then I hide and I keep sneaking around away from this Guy and eventually I have a clear shot toward his dune buggy.

27
00:02:02,382 --> 00:02:05,070
Rym: So I just ran for it and he didn't see me.

28
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,875
Rym: and I got in the dune buggy.

29
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:15,080
Rym: and just as I start driving away I hear a ton of gunfire and he's behind me running and just emptying his clip and missing and I left him behind.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:24,080
Scott: because Kill even though it you should Game has no way of knowing that you killed that person with the wall, but I was all gets credit.

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,680
Rym: I was so happy about this that I was just sort of holding down on the road and laughing.

32
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,869
Scott: That didn't actually count as a kill on your stats.

33
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,452
Scott: No, no, no.

34
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:32,773
Scott: Okay.

35
00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:34,340
Rym: I did kill two other people.

36
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:38,427
Scott: Big step up I think.

37
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:39,834
Scott: so you've killed three people.

38
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:40,980
Rym: so I've killed three people.

39
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:43,180
Scott: That's a total of two more people than I have killed.

40
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:45,447
Rym: We got to play some more.

41
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:47,397
Scott: Maybe I should just plate after I eat tonight.

42
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:51,960
Scott: I'll go home I'll eat and then I'll just play until I kill someone no matter how long that takes even if I don't go to work.

43
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:56,820
Rym: Maybe when we team up again, our new goal should just be our only goal is to kill someone.

44
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,529
Rym: We don't care if we make it past that point.

45
00:02:58,569 --> 00:02:59,937
Scott: Yeah, they're their teammate can kill us.

46
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:00,580
Scott: We're okay with that.

47
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,679
Rym: Yeah, we just got to kill one.

48
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,069
Rym: All right, so it's a tech day.

49
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,532
Rym: It's not.

50
00:03:04,592 --> 00:03:10,956
Rym: if we somehow kill two And then some sniper will be like what are those guys jumping around for?

51
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:20,440
Scott: but oop So I got any news on this glorious Monday, there's not a lot of Monday news, but I got this one.

52
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,315
Rym: So this is actually a pretty big deal.

53
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:22,880
Scott: I don't know.

54
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,767
Scott: It's not that big a deal.

55
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:24,653
Scott: Adobe is always.

56
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:28,448
Scott: if you go look at it You know people always pay attention to Apple and Microsoft or whatever, right?

57
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:38,040
Scott: But when Adobe announces stuff, they usually announce these ridiculous features Usually that make it to Photoshop way after they announce them or other software like Premiere.

58
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,598
Scott: I remember when I was watching an Adobe thing a few years ago and they were announcing the ability.

59
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:54,260
Scott: in like Premiere you could like draw around a license plate in a video on one frame and to blur it out and that it would Automatically follow that license plate and all the other frames of the video and blur it out.

60
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,519
Scott: So you wouldn't have to like go to every single frame and blur.

61
00:03:56,922 --> 00:03:57,485
Scott: Yeah, I was like.

62
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:00,099
Scott: that's really amazing that they did that and that was years ago.

63
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:13,540
Scott: So a new thing that they they announced is of course the people who made Photoshop can do this right the technology that can tell When something's been photoshopped and which parts of the image have been photoshopped.

64
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:17,332
Scott: This is actually now you no longer have to be able like I see the pixels.

65
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:26,280
Scott: as soon as this software becomes available for public Use there'll be some tools and you could just load it and be like, yep This tool says this was likely Photoshop.

66
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:31,980
Rym: The reason this is so important is that the Adobe tools and in general media creation tools.

67
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,562
Rym: There's sort of this.

68
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:41,630
Rym: there's an ethical dilemma where if you make certain kinds of editing too good and too accessible It makes it very easy to make convincing fakes.

69
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,708
Rym: that can as we saw in the 2016 election Really damaged society.

70
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,620
Scott: There's a lot of and the technology of making fakes.

71
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,640
Scott: You know, there's that fake porn thing recently where they put celebrities faces on to porn actors or even more.

72
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:00,540
Rym: What about the the audition stuff where you could theoretically have audio of someone and just change one of the words?

73
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,449
Rym: They said it sounds totally natural.

74
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:02,811
Scott: Yep.

75
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:15,799
Rym: Now normal person thinks oh, I will use that to correct when I mispronounce that word in my podcast, but Expanding brain person says I will just use that to get people to say things they didn't say and then sue them over it.

76
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:21,987
Rym: So the technology the ethical thing to do is Expanding expanding super mega.

77
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:25,397
Scott: brain person says I'll pretend I used that technology when I didn't.

78
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:34,623
Scott: Yeah But the ethics of that kind of technology say bad things and then claim that someone used that technology to make me say bad I mean when I didn't.

79
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:39,200
Rym: how many conservatives are doing that now, but I didn't tweet that someone hacked my accounts exactly.

80
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:48,040
Rym: But The because there's been a lot of problems lately with technology being used to harm society in very direct ways.

81
00:05:48,802 --> 00:06:00,532
Rym: the the ethical thing to do is as you design technology that obviously has possible nefarious uses is to Also design at the same time the technology to mitigate that.

82
00:06:00,572 --> 00:06:03,620
Scott: damn if you're gonna be a mad scientist to invents a poison.

83
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:07,256
Scott: But that poison also cures a disease and doesn't kill.

84
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,240
Scott: people have the disease.

85
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:09,620
Scott: So we need to make this poison.

86
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:14,180
Scott: You should also make the antidote for that poison in case someone gives it to someone who doesn't have the disease.

87
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:15,803
Scott: Right.

88
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:19,517
Scott: to just make the poison only would be bad mad scientist shit.

89
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:23,309
Scott: Yep Also, don't be like a cartoon mad scientist.

90
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:24,532
Scott: We're knowing and get the antidote.

91
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:27,320
Scott: You should make the antidote more plentiful than the poison.

92
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,854
Rym: Well, don't be a supervillain is really the answer.

93
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:38,254
Rym: you can be a mad scientist But the situation Scott described starts edging into mad scientist supervillain.

94
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:39,980
Scott: what mad scientists are not super.

95
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:42,517
Rym: I imagine there's some okay mad scientist.

96
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:43,000
Rym: They're just mad.

97
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:47,432
Rym: They make like an apple replicator that just makes more apples and that's it.

98
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:48,134
Scott: That's not mad.

99
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,700
Scott: That's just that's kind of mad.

100
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:50,859
Rym: What do you what do you need that for?

101
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,086
Scott: Apples feeding feeding the world.

102
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:54,772
Rym: apples literally grow on trees.

103
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:56,939
Rym: We have more food and more apples than we know what to do with.

104
00:06:57,602 --> 00:06:59,210
Scott: No, there's a lot of people are hungry.

105
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,616
Rym: Yeah, that's a distribution problem.

106
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:05,907
Scott: Not a production problem Yeah, but what if we can't put an apple tree where they live because it's not fertile But we can put an apple machine where they also?

107
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:08,700
Rym: apples are not enough to live on by themselves better than starving.

108
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:14,060
Rym: Contrary to the Disney cartoon about Johnny Appleseed apples are not alone able to sustain.

109
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,227
Scott: You know, keep you going long enough that you can grow something else, maybe You eat some apples.

110
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:21,160
Scott: You won't be dying of hunger immediately.

111
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,619
Scott: So now you can go to Maslow's hierarchies next level and start making a farm.

112
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:31,980
Rym: So in some actually pretty related news There's some facial recognition company and the CEO made an interesting argument.

113
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:32,642
Scott: I saw this.

114
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:37,340
Scott: he basically said and I'm gonna cluster a CEO of facial recognition company.

115
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:40,922
Scott: I know all about this technology, but trust what I have to say There's a

116
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:46,880
Rym: bunch of stories are in facial recognition recently again but this was pretty interesting because they got that the head of this company basically said

117
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:47,783
Scott: law

118
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:55,518
Rym: enforcement should not be allowed to use facial recognition because of the technologies built-in biases and vulnerability to abuse

119
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:56,887
Scott: Mm-hmm,

120
00:07:56,908 --> 00:08:08,760
Rym: so he started making this argument that Commercial or even surveillance capitalist uses are probably okay Or at least they're neutral because they have both benefits in arms of society.

121
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:15,820
Rym: But using them for government or law enforcement purposes is way more dangerous than it is valuable.

122
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,420
Scott: All right, I'm gonna make an argument, but you have to promise that you will not start discussing this argument.

123
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:26,600
Scott: You will just hear the argument and the question I'm going to make and not answer it because it will take you hours.

124
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:35,410
Rym: okay in return we should do either a Monday or Thursday show in the future on the Tech transfer questions around facial recognition.

125
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:37,980
Scott: No, this is a different question, but it's not a tangent.

126
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,320
Rym: I'm just saying to get my promise to not turn this into an argument.

127
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,078
Rym: You got to give me the show at some point.

128
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:53,920
Scott: Here you have a person and you heard Scott said alright and this person owns a company and they are declining To serve customers based on the industry that they are coming from.

129
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,799
Scott: So we obviously think this is okay.

130
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:05,240
Scott: Yeah, and we think it is not okay to decline to serve customers because they are a certain color gender sexuality.

131
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,786
Rym: I'm going with this.

132
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:07,792
Rym: I won't start the argument.

133
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:11,492
Rym: I'm just gonna point out that There's a very obvious and clear line.

134
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:15,300
Rym: if where you're going is where I think you're going So what if someone were to do both?

135
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:27,937
Scott: What if a gun store refused to sell guns to white people because but used this argument instead of a discrimination reason Ah, or just freedom reason law and precedent aside answering the question you promise not to answer.

136
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:28,760
Rym: I'm not gonna argue it.

137
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:30,323
Scott: That's the end.

138
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:31,487
Scott: Go move to the next topic.

139
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:32,410
Rym: Okay.

140
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,574
Rym: I'll just let it be.

141
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,040
Rym: I got things to say.

142
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,246
Rym: I I will hold up to my bargain.

143
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:38,510
Rym: I'll just keep it in.

144
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:40,949
Scott: I'll keep it in.

145
00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:41,695
Scott: it's hard, isn't it?

146
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,925
Rym: tantalizing question in Some other news.

147
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:48,270
Rym: that won't start an argument.

148
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:54,350
Rym: So I saw this trending all over the place and It won't affect me because I'm gonna buy a 4k monitor.

149
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:55,575
Rym: I gotta buy a new monitor.

150
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:56,740
Scott: But what's wrong with your monitor?

151
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,907
Scott: Oh the other one the one that's that one.

152
00:09:59,007 --> 00:09:59,650
Scott: It's 16 17 years old.

153
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,945
Scott: that one Also this one.

154
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:04,352
Scott: I think I bought that in 2002. also this monitor.

155
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:08,793
Rym: The only reason it looks okay is I've turned the brightness way up.

156
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,440
Rym: This monitor is real old and real dim.

157
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:12,300
Scott: I was actually watching on YouTube.

158
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:19,720
Scott: It was some people who it was like people recording a radio show But they're also just live-streaming them sitting in the radio studio and around the table with microphones.

159
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:26,625
Scott: They had that monitor the Samsung 17 2x with Wow But it's got.

160
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:31,460
Rym: this monitor is from I think I bought this in 2007 this old Dell ultra sharp.

161
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:33,470
Scott: What that's the same ultra sharp I got right?

162
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,395
Scott: Yeah, the u2410?

163
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,530
Scott: Yeah, it's like the best 1600 by 1200 monitor you can get.

164
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,119
Rym: yep, but I want a higher resolution monitor.

165
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,942
Scott: now 16 by 9.

166
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,367
Scott: I know I'm gonna I'm.

167
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:48,600
Rym: I have to give up on 16 by 10 even though it is the superior aspect ratio.

168
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,859
Scott: Why I just stick with lower resolution?

169
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,430
Scott: Because I also why do you need so many case?

170
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,315
Scott: for I do need.

171
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:55,160
Rym: I need more peas.

172
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:56,432
Scott: You don't need more peas.

173
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:57,682
Rym: I need a few more peas I don't need.

174
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:58,788
Scott: you know what I've got.

175
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,859
Scott: I got two of those monitors right on my desk And you know what?

176
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,980
Scott: I'm planning to keep them for another until like everything is 4k like all the video.

177
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:11,234
Rym: Real it's because I edit a lot of video.

178
00:11:11,294 --> 00:11:12,560
Rym: more peas would make it easier.

179
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:15,719
Scott: But I'm gonna buy a 4k TV before I buy a 4k model.

180
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,446
Rym: But also it's got.

181
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:25,302
Rym: I'm gonna take this monitor Turn it sideways stick it here and take this old Samsung monitor and give it its proper Viking burial because this thing is too old to Suffer.

182
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:25,985
Scott: don't work.

183
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:26,587
Scott: Someone can use it.

184
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:27,109
Rym: Yeah, it's got.

185
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:30,885
Rym: the brightness is turned all the way up and colors Just don't up here.

186
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:32,133
Scott: I see colors blue green red.

187
00:11:33,803 --> 00:11:36,256
Rym: There are still some colors on this morning John there.

188
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:36,840
Rym: That is true.

189
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:40,325
Rym: But anyway, here's the problem.

190
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:50,960
Rym: so the without with LCD monitors you never Want to run the monitor in a resolution that is different from its native resolution.

191
00:11:51,321 --> 00:12:02,473
Scott: I don't want to get into why because right there's always some other way like for example if I am Playing a game and I need to be 1080p right for streaming purposes.

192
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:07,671
Scott: I won't change the monitor to be 1080p I'll just get the game to run and 1080p full-screen.

193
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:10,240
Scott: So there's black pixels at the top and bottom.

194
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:11,880
Rym: Yeah, there's ways to get around it.

195
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:18,680
Rym: But it's old monitors actually did have variable resolution like pixels could be smaller and it would be fine.

196
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:20,466
Rym: but CRT is our ancient technology.

197
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,697
Rym: ready to talk about them in the modern world with an LCD.

198
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:35,659
Rym: if the resolution that your video card is sending to the monitor is not its native resolution meaning one LCD pixel equals one computer pixel Your monitor is gonna look like shit.

199
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:40,600
Scott: Well, you could use a resolution of the same aspect ratio and then it would still be one-to-one pixels.

200
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:43,039
Scott: You would just have a lot of pixels that weren't doing anything.

201
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:44,320
Rym: Yeah, well the so the well.

202
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:52,040
Rym: Yes If you also if it's if it downscales and you have a lot of blank space around it exactly There'll be a setting in your monitor for like stretch or no stretch.

203
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,083
Scott: You never want to stretch.

204
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:59,334
Rym: but the other problem is that even if you do that, yeah, it would be fine But then you're just wasting a whole chunk of your.

205
00:12:59,435 --> 00:12:59,799
Scott: obviously.

206
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:09,392
Rym: But even if you do some perfect aspect ratio like every four pixels in the square be the equivalent It has to be one-to-one.

207
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,180
Scott: the resolution you're right.

208
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,600
Scott: Yeah, one pixel of the actually one physical pixel needs to represent one pixel in the frame buff.

209
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,551
Rym: Yeah, what I was getting to is that that still is not good.

210
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:20,200
Rym: So what's happening now?

211
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:42,890
Rym: Hi, this happened a while ago where suddenly everyone was making these 1920 by 20 1080 panels and that's why monitors got to the weird place They are today because it's cheaper for manufacturers of the core components to make the same thing over and over so it costs pretty much the same in the modern era to make a 2560 by 1440 panel as it does to make a 4k panel.

212
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:58,086
Rym: So what some companies appear to be doing now when they sell a 1440p Monitor is they just put a 4k panel in it and lock the firmware into downscaling Mm-hmm.

213
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:07,937
Scott: So the moral is either don't buy 1440p monitors Only buy a monitor from a high quality that you know is a high quality model.

214
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:10,368
Scott: That is the advertised.

215
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:22,743
Rym: or if you want if you actually want to buy a 1440p resolution monitor you need to do your research to confirm that the monitor you're buying has a physical native resolution of 1440p.

216
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:31,194
Rym: because if it's a 4k panel in there your monitor is gonna look like shit And you probably can't easily hack that firmware to use the rest of them.

217
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:38,400
Scott: I'm sure someone will but the point is At the you know Especially at the prospect of being able to get a 4k monitor for much less than a 4k price.

218
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,047
Scott: Someone will find a way to hack that firmware.

219
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:42,477
Scott: But yeah, this is why on monitors.

220
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:43,180
Scott: I never skimp.

221
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,858
Scott: I always tell people, you know get that fancy IPS screen get the you know, go all out.

222
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:48,520
Scott: get the ultra sharp.

223
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,203
Scott: Don't get that shit.

224
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:49,987
Scott: Oh crap model.

225
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:52,560
Scott: get the fancy model cuz monitors matter a lot.

226
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,600
Scott: That's the part of the computer actually that's going into your eyes.

227
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,644
Scott: You're using it the most.

228
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:57,427
Scott: it matter.

229
00:14:57,468 --> 00:15:00,500
Scott: you better off getting a better monitor than a better CPU or a better video.

230
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:07,000
Rym: Like at my old job I had a generic 1080p the mouse keyboard and monitor the three most important things kind of like the computer chair.

231
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:23,119
Rym: Yeah But when I had that gennaro 1080p like monitor at work The problem was soon as I go into Photoshop or InDesign to make something Something to look fine because I just can't see the full color gamut and then I look at it on a real monitor later Or I print it and it looks like garbo.

232
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:30,701
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

233
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:31,424
Rym: What do you got for me?

234
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:32,750
Rym: I see two videos.

235
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,299
Scott: These two videos go with each other.

236
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,349
Scott: one video is actually they're from the same channel And one of them is linked as the top comment on the other one.

237
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:42,245
Scott: But we're gonna provide both links to make life easy for you.

238
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:43,150
Scott: So here's the deal, right?

239
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,770
Scott: There's a lot of you react videos all over YouTube.

240
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,605
Scott: That's a big trend and it started off as like those kids react things and it was sort of just like lol.

241
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:57,970
Scott: watch people's You know emotional face reactions when they see things like have kids use old computers lol, right?

242
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,756
Rym: They're usually utterly painful to watch.

243
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:03,330
Scott: Yes, but now there's actually this new genre of react video.

244
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,709
Scott: I don't it's not that new but I'm actually way into it because what it is?

245
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,149
Scott: It's have person who is expert react to thing and inform you about it, right?

246
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:16,530
Scott: So for example this one it is like this really good kpop channel.

247
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:25,070
Scott: It's react to the K where there's a bunch of students Who are students at the Eastman School of Music at U of R and they watch their classical trained musicians, right?

248
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,559
Scott: Attending like basically a conservatory.

249
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:29,509
Scott: that's relatively highbrow, right?

250
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:39,022
Scott: It's not as fancy as the one in New York, but it's still still highbrow and they're watching kpop videos, right and being like Oh, do you see the pentatonic thing they did there?

251
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:43,797
Rym: Oh, all right, so What is pentatonic means guy?

252
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:44,621
Scott: I have no fucking clue.

253
00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:46,028
Rym: Okay, just saying move and carry on.

254
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:54,186
Scott: The here right is a same genre of video.

255
00:16:54,266 --> 00:17:13,910
Scott: we have three Mario's not Mario's with their chefs from Italy from high fancy Italian restaurants in Rome, right and They're watching the top five most viewed YouTube videos about how to make Carbonara and they are judging the people who are you know, including one famous chef, right?

256
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,670
Scott: They're judging these people and they're like, oh, what do you put in the garlic?

257
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:24,454
Scott: Right, and then the other video is they show you how they make it The right way.

258
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:27,230
Scott: so it's really fascinating to see them.

259
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,107
Scott: You know like actual Italian chefs go to celebrity chef and be like, oh, what are you doing?

260
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:33,349
Scott: You don't know how to make that What's wrong?

261
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:36,132
Scott: You Know.

262
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:41,730
Scott: that also shows like, you know, you can't always trust the most viewed thing on professor you right?

263
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,213
Rym: Oh my god You know what?

264
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:48,273
Scott: I could have gone to YouTube and search for like how to make carbonara and in the top five videos are all Wrong.

265
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,650
Scott: I gotta find don't make this happen.

266
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:59,765
Rym: I want to get some filthy casual to like who's good and like you like I'd like to see a Speedrunner of Megaman to watch you play Megaman and a speedrunner of bionic commando.

267
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:02,653
Rym: watch me play bionic commando Commentate like.

268
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:10,790
Scott: the thing is I don't play Megaman 2 in a speedrun way I play in a in a. when I play Megaman 2 I play in a way that's safe.

269
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:18,155
Scott: I know that I can get really far and have a high chance of beating the game without dying Exactly in a hurry, right?

270
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:19,700
Scott: It's like I get to a hard jump.

271
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:20,904
Scott: I'll stay there.

272
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:21,867
Scott: I'll get ready.

273
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:22,770
Rym: think about it.

274
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,422
Scott: You know like in Mario if they go there's a big jump coming.

275
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:26,366
Scott: All right, let's get ready.

276
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:27,350
Scott: Let's get in the right position.

277
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:31,487
Scott: Okay, go right I won't just be like go go go go go except this level one.

278
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:33,017
Scott: then I go go go right because it's so easy.

279
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:40,310
Rym: so my thing of the day and Before you ask us got asked when I said this is my thing of the day if the if this lock is easily defeated.

280
00:18:41,051 --> 00:18:43,782
Rym: The answer is clearly yes, because otherwise it wouldn't be my thing of the day.

281
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:45,610
Scott: Okay, so it's so easily defeatable lock.

282
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:52,537
Rym: there's this fancy hundred dollar smart lock and it's a padlock, but it's not like a Online internet of things.

283
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:53,241
Rym: smart lock.

284
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:53,783
Scott: It's okay.

285
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,150
Scott: You can't hack it with some Wi-Fi.

286
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,920
Rym: You can't hack it with some Wi-Fi or anything.

287
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,750
Scott: Just it's just a computer inside of it.

288
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,404
Rym: Yep, instead of having a combination or key.

289
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:03,850
Rym: It just has a fingerprint reader.

290
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:14,861
Rym: You can program different fingerprints into it and the fingerprint reader Not only is super reliable and they couldn't easily defeat it But even if they scratch the shit out of it, it still works fine.

291
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:20,561
Rym: Hmm, like they scratch the shit out of the reader It still unlocks only when the right person tries to also.

292
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:25,658
Scott: the actual fingerprint memory and record Detection technology was actually very high quality.

293
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:25,858
Scott: Yep.

294
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,042
Rym: That's not the vulnerability.

295
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,108
Scott: It's not a hundred percent foolproof, but it very good.

296
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,818
Rym: So The problem with this law?

297
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:33,886
Scott: it actually sounds really useful as like a good lock.

298
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:35,708
Scott: You can't get your combination You can't forget your key.

299
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,641
Rym: I'd be very inclined to get this right.

300
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:44,310
Scott: is the lock like actually Physically secure as well as as good as any other padlock in terms of you know, like being damaged by a hammer?

301
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,160
Rym: So it is in the sense that not physically.

302
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,424
Rym: to break it.

303
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:56,110
Scott: It would require a big old bolt cutters So the same as any other equivalent lock except for basically paying extra for this convenience except for one fatal flaw.

304
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:59,146
Rym: Okay, so I can hack this thing in 30 seconds.

305
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:02,020
Rym: Oh, no, so it turns off.

306
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:06,249
Scott: it turns out that the back of it Does it have a battery or something that runs out?

307
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,969
Rym: Well, it has a battery but if the battery runs out you just can't unlock it.

308
00:20:09,471 --> 00:20:09,973
Scott: That sucks.

309
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:13,063
Rym: The battery seems to last for fucking efforts like this giant lithium-ion battery.

310
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:13,705
Rym: They're just in it.

311
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:18,410
Rym: All right, but the back Looks like it's steel.

312
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:24,269
Rym: You can't just break into it If you just put a suction thing on the back of this lock and twist it the whole back just comes off.

313
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,770
Rym: What's under there for Phillips head screws?

314
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:44,755
Rym: and if you remove those because the back that you twist off is how you replace the battery and then if you just open that Back take the battery out and open the for Phillips head screws You can just physically open the lock by tugging on a thing inside of it and you're done So.

315
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:46,429
Rym: you can just take the back off the lock.

316
00:20:48,417 --> 00:21:01,509
Rym: Once again tech bros like to design Technological solutions that solve things but lack the basic domain knowledge of the core area From which the problem arises.

317
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:09,670
Scott: If I'm making a lock that has a battery Right, what you should do is make it so that you can only access the battery compartment if the lock is unlocked.

318
00:21:10,191 --> 00:21:12,077
Rym: It's almost like a lock.

319
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:14,002
Rym: you should talk to someone who is an expert in.

320
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:27,930
Scott: you could easily made that twisty panel untwistable when the lock was locked with some sort of you know piece of metal in the way and then make it so that when You unlock the lock the twisty piece of metal on the back to access the battery compartment is now twisted.

321
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:30,943
Rym: Oh my god, so one of the first comments on this YouTube video.

322
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:32,570
Rym: now imagine if someone did this.

323
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,630
Rym: But instead of stealing stuff, they just remove the battery and close the lock.

324
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:37,754
Rym: Troll of the century.

325
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:42,510
Scott: Well remove the battery open the lock steal the stuff then close the lock.

326
00:21:45,212 --> 00:21:47,910
Scott: The person's trying to open this lock desperately, right.

327
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:53,280
Scott: They finally go and get some bolt cutters or whatever and find a way to open it And then they open the lock and then everything's gone.

328
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,284
Scott: when they open it and it's already gone gone with the shit Instead of looking for a thief they tried to fix their lock.

329
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:00,770
Scott: They didn't think there was any thief involved.

330
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:04,050
Scott: They didn't check any security camera footage because they didn't think anything was stolen.

331
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,890
Scott: By the time they check it you're even farther away.

332
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:09,530
Rym: That's something I've learned in my entire life and it's my advice to you.

333
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:20,700
Rym: If you think you're gonna commit a crime The most important thing to know is how long all the places that have security camera footage from that area Actually keep their archives because usually they don't keep them that long.

334
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,081
Rym: Nope.

335
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:22,424
Rym: You got a time delay.

336
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:24,270
Rym: the discovery of your crimes children.

337
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:40,410
Rym: So in the meta moment the book club book, which might be if it is not the next Thursday GeekNights episode It will definitely be the following Thursday GeekNights episode Because we will be done within a month reading the Odyssey.

338
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:49,578
Scott: I'll have to set a reminder to read it again because basically I've only been reading it on my iPhone on the train and I Haven't been taking any trades, but if we go to the beach on Sunday I'll probably finish the whole thing laying on the beach.

339
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,426
Scott: I'd have to bring a phone.

340
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:52,350
Scott: I guess I'll bring my phone.

341
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,408
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna bring my phone.

342
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:54,815
Rym: Phone's waterproof.

343
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:55,781
Rym: I can just bring you to the beach.

344
00:22:56,003 --> 00:22:56,164
Scott: Don't?

345
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:57,150
Scott: I'd rather just not her.

346
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,798
Scott: Maybe I could just get away with my watch only.

347
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,145
Rym: I'm confident.

348
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:02,850
Rym: We'll do this soon, but We'll start the thread.

349
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,721
Rym: I'm gonna start poking in the forum thread and tweet and typing up some initial thoughts.

350
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:17,350
Rym: because uh, I really really recommend That everyone read this translation of the Odyssey regardless of whether or not you have read any other translation of the Odyssey.

351
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:20,416
Rym: It's great Mm-hmm in the rest of the meta moment.

352
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:40,650
Rym: the next big convention that we will be performing at is packs Wes and then PAX Unplugged And then after that, I think it's magfest and hopefully also the anime NYC Because I can take the subway to it and I seize after unplugged before breakfast.

353
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,490
Rym: I don't even know when they all all I know is all the panels of vision deadlines are like this week.

354
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:45,916
Rym: I'm sorting all that stuff out.

355
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:47,241
Rym: I've submitted a bunch.

356
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:50,974
Rym: I haven't run any of them by you for West but I'm sure we'll be fine.

357
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:51,356
Rym: Whatever.

358
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:54,147
Rym: I'm putting in a bunch because I figure variety.

359
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:56,169
Rym: let them pick anyway.

360
00:23:57,051 --> 00:24:08,269
Rym: Otherwise, I want to call this out again because I've noticed lately a lot of people have been fleeing in particular anime forums and tabletop gaming forums.

361
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:25,930
Rym: I've seen a lot of Twitter Chatter about that and the reason that people are leaving all those forums is because most forums on the internet are full of fucking Nazis these days Because they have poor moderation or they worship at the almighty teat of free speech without understanding what that actually entails.

362
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:33,774
Rym: So I just want to remind all of you that if you're a near nerd or geek of some kind and you're listening to these Words, why would you be?

363
00:24:33,794 --> 00:24:40,794
Rym: I don't know but apparently you are anyone who's still listening to this episode of GeekNights this far into.

364
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:52,169
Rym: it would probably do well to join the GeekNights community forum because We the only rule we have is you can't be a goddamn Nazi and you can't be annoying and we don't make a big ceremony.

365
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,221
Rym: Just if someone shitty we don't even say anything.

366
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,910
Rym: we just ban them and they disappear forever and you don't have to worry about it.

367
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:08,402
Rym: so if you want a community of people who are chill to talk about anime or to form gaming groups, I Can't think of a better one than our own forum.

368
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:09,546
Rym: Like I'm not even joking.

369
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:16,518
Rym: Mmm Boardgame geek doesn't really have the Nazis like a and n does but even then board game geek I would not for me.

370
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:24,709
Rym: I mean it just has you know, grog nard misogynist I would not form a gaming group from the board game geek forum is all I'm saying.

371
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:25,070
Rym: That's right.

372
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:31,050
Rym: I would not advertise where at a PAX I am hanging out LFG in that forum.

373
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:35,352
Rym: No, but I would do that in the front row crew forum, which is our forum Mm-hmm.

374
00:25:35,654 --> 00:25:44,070
Rym: And also if you don't feel like you have a lot to contribute I say join anyway, because you know people don't realize how many lurkers that forum has.

375
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:45,723
Scott: It has a lot of lurkers like.

376
00:25:45,804 --> 00:25:46,590
Rym: it's terrifying.

377
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:53,001
Rym: But if you post in the GeekNights forum You probably get more readers than your actual blog.

378
00:25:53,202 --> 00:26:08,716
Scott: a lot of people like use it as their blog and like start a thing Like, you know a lot of people have threads that are like only so and so cares like only Scott cares and they post about a thing all The time and even though they're the only one posting in this thread using it like a blog People are reading it.

379
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:09,380
Scott: Yep.

380
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:10,144
Scott: I have proof.

381
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,286
Rym: I Mean, I'm just looking at like the the things of your day.

382
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:15,855
Rym: thread has like 35,000 views and like 2,000 pose.

383
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:20,598
Rym: There's people in here and they're all cool.

384
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:32,862
Rym: Cuz if they're not cool Scott or I just banned them and you'll never worry about them again, oh And uh, we're not there obviously, but as GDQ is happening right now Yep, and I'm just gonna watch it all on YouTube as they get uploaded.

385
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,307
Scott: cuz I watch some live-action.

386
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:35,732
Rym: I've been too busy I've I?

387
00:26:36,153 --> 00:26:39,483
Rym: the nature of having changed jobs is that I do.

388
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,125
Rym: it's interesting.

389
00:26:40,206 --> 00:26:47,093
Rym: I do less like Work, like I'm not Designing you eyes anymore Like I'm not.

390
00:26:47,715 --> 00:26:54,197
Rym: I'm not looking at an API and trying to do a proof-of-concept like I'm not doing that type of work anymore But instead I have to.

391
00:26:54,639 --> 00:27:02,390
Rym: all my work entails talking to people Talking to people making powerpoints and then presenting them to people and making decisions

392
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:03,293
Scott: So

393
00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:16,700
Rym: I don't have as much time to sit at my desk and like idly consume something while I work on something I spend all my time literally like going to a meeting being the adult and after people plead their cases to me for an hour I say this is what we're doing.

394
00:27:16,781 --> 00:27:18,429
Rym: That is the decision and that's all I had to do.

395
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,730
Rym: So yeah, I'm gonna watch YouTube streams instead of the live stream.

396
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:27,409
Rym: So, uh, yeah, we somehow did an episode on fucking no SQL.

397
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:29,116
Scott: Well, cuz that was the hot thing.

398
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:29,537
Scott: It was.

399
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:31,103
Scott: it was actually a funny article today.

400
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:34,232
Scott: Someone wrote and they were like blockchain 2018 no SQL.

401
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,139
Scott: Yeah, that's right that's accurate.

402
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:41,330
Rym: yeah, yeah, so we're gonna talk about relational databases.

403
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,319
Rym: I don't think we're gonna get to do like.

404
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,819
Rym: you're not gonna learn from this episode Whether or not you should use MySQL or Postgres.

405
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:55,550
Scott: as far as you write all that matters to you is as for most people They're the exact same goddamn thing with slightly different user interface.

406
00:27:55,871 --> 00:28:04,190
Rym: So I guess what is a relational database compared to all the other ways you might store data Start babies first.

407
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:08,030
Scott: So you are gonna make some software right and you got it.

408
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,875
Scott: You have some data and you want to store that data Somewhere where it doesn't go away.

409
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:13,922
Scott: when someone closes the program it opens it again.

410
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:14,243
Scott: Yep.

411
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:20,390
Rym: Now if you just put it in a fucking file Yep, if you're using Python you could just like what pickle dot IO.

412
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:27,310
Rym: There's other ways to put stuff in a file But you could like serialize it into an object and like write it to a file system somewhere, right?

413
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:33,970
Scott: There are a lot of ways to put things in a file But the problem is when something's in a file, it's not that easy to work with that data, right?

414
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,422
Scott: It's like you can't easily if you want to search your file for things.

415
00:28:37,944 --> 00:28:41,102
Scott: or let's say you got like a list of names And you want you know, it's like that.

416
00:28:41,223 --> 00:28:41,869
Scott: that's hard to do.

417
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:56,669
Rym: I'll put it this way the thing that put the data in the file is usually the only thing that can really take the data out of the file and If there's any question about how you're gonna use that data the people who wrote the thing to put the data in Have to deal with that.

418
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,745
Rym: so like what if two people are gonna try to write to the file at the same time?

419
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:08,130
Scott: you have to what if you want a bunch of different programs to all share the same data and You know like you've only got one file in the file system.

420
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,895
Scott: You can like synchronize this file.

421
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:14,870
Rym: like what if the data you want to store is four thousand terabytes of data, right?

422
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:17,159
Scott: So this is what a database solves.

423
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:19,710
Scott: now the thing with a relational database, right?

424
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,480
Scott: It's like well, what's what's relational about it versus other databases?

425
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,430
Scott: Well, imagine you got yourself a spreadsheet, right?

426
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:37,049
Scott: And this spreadsheet has a bunch of columns name spreadsheets already Revolutionized like data in the modern world like spreadsheets are a big deal name phone number address Whatever, you know all the data, right?

427
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:39,578
Scott: And you can certainly got a spreadsheet.

428
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:51,030
Scott: well spreadsheets you can search spreadsheets You can sort spreadsheets you can filter spreadsheets you can write functions against them You can make reports you can put math in the cells You can do all kinds of stuff in a spreadsheet.

429
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,150
Scott: The problem is if you get lots and lots of data suddenly spreadsheet gets really really big.

430
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,677
Rym: I was all show on my desktop at work.

431
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:01,345
Rym: So I was doing a little like some really simple data analysis.

432
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:06,377
Rym: It has like 900,000 elements right now.

433
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:09,684
Scott: imagine sometimes, you know spreadsheet gets lots of redundant data.

434
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:15,537
Scott: For example, let's say we were gonna make a spreadsheet of Game collections right now.

435
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:16,159
Scott: It's one thing.

436
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:25,430
Scott: Normally if you're just keeping track of your normally as it normalized People who would put a game collection in a spreadsheet are just keeping track of their own game collection.

437
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,000
Scott: Yep, so they just they only one sheet they could just have.

438
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,878
Scott: you know name of the game, you know, what year it came out Who designed the game?

439
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:36,622
Rym: No, this is fine because say if I'm the only one using it It's just like the file thing we talked about.

440
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:41,989
Rym: spreadsheet is just fine But if I change my schema, like I want to add another column, I'm the only one using the spreadsheet.

441
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:44,561
Rym: anyway It's not gonna break anything because it's my spreadsheet.

442
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:46,350
Rym: I know what I did to the data, right?

443
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:46,832
Scott: And it's only.

444
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:50,690
Scott: but now let's say you want to have a website that lets everyone keep track of their game collection.

445
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:57,772
Scott: Well, so suddenly you got a spreadsheet and column one is you know name of the game and column two is name of the person Who owns it?

446
00:30:57,873 --> 00:30:59,420
Scott: Alright, so I own a copy of Puerto Rico.

447
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:01,450
Scott: now Rym also owns a copy of Puerto Rico.

448
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,270
Scott: So now in the next row, it's like well, it's Scott, Puerto Rico.

449
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:09,170
Rym: Then it's Rym Puerto Rico, but both Rym and Scott Puerto Rico have to have all the information about Puerto Rico, right?

450
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:17,190
Scott: It's like well, we're you know, suddenly it's like Scott, Puerto Rico Made by Andrea Seyfarth came out in whatever year it was, right?

451
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:24,430
Scott: And then suddenly we're repeating all this information about Puerto Rico and we're repeating all this information about Scott every single freaking time.

452
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:30,827
Scott: Well a relational database is basically a bunch of spreadsheets except you can link from one spreadsheet to another.

453
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:38,470
Scott: so we can say Scott Puerto Rico and that Puerto Rico is actually a link to another spreadsheet that has all the info about games.

454
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:44,995
Scott: You have one spreadsheet with all the people one spreadsheet with all the games and then we have a table that links the people to The games.

455
00:31:45,257 --> 00:31:53,121
Scott: so now we don't have to repeat ourselves Right, and if we update say that if Puerto Rico changes its name to a different game We can change that and it changes for everyone.

456
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:57,600
Scott: We don't have to change out for everybody We just change it one place change for everyone because it's just a link.

457
00:31:57,861 --> 00:32:13,240
Rym: now the problem this solves is primarily around data integrity In that now you understand like you basically put rules around how data is related to other data and You can enforce those interactions.

458
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,769
Rym: You can react to those interactions you understand them and You'll never get in a situation where the data gets out of sync.

459
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:29,602
Rym: The detriment of doing this is that it does reduce the performance because if I want to do a query against this data now I have to hit look at all these different tables.

460
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:31,769
Scott: If you want to say right if you want them together, right?

461
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,336
Scott: It's like oh, I want to get a list.

462
00:32:33,356 --> 00:32:34,401
Scott: So we've got one table.

463
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:35,265
Scott: This is a list of people.

464
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:37,960
Scott: when I want spreadsheet That's all people and one spreadsheet.

465
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,684
Scott: That's all games.

466
00:32:39,006 --> 00:32:41,749
Scott: And now we want to say All right Give me a list of every game Scott owns.

467
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:50,194
Scott: Well, we got to get the Scott row from the people table and then we got to look at this other in-between table and figure Out okay Well, which games is Scott own?

468
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:57,137
Scott: get all those from the game table and then mash them together into one new spreadsheet And then we'll actually deliver that.

469
00:32:57,157 --> 00:32:58,482
Scott: and that takes CPU.

470
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:00,190
Scott: the CPU has to do a bunch of work, right?

471
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:02,505
Scott: Normally if you just had spreadsheets you had to do any work.

472
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:03,572
Scott: you just look at it right now.

473
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:06,690
Rym: one reaction to this problem was no sequel which we've talked about.

474
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:12,739
Rym: Another reaction to this problem is you might hear people who are more database II talking about Normalizing a database.

475
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,390
Rym: or do you normalizing a database?

476
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,630
Scott: That's just about you because you have to make decisions about where are we gonna break apart?

477
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,619
Scott: Sometimes it's obvious people games.

478
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:26,130
Scott: So when you're actually doing real-world work It's not so obvious which spreadsheets to make and which ones to link.

479
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:31,636
Rym: Yeah, like you might think logically make sense to split it up a certain way but your user might not be a human.

480
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:41,368
Rym: your user might be some UI on a web page somewhere and the Kinds of questions that UI is asking might not map to what you logically think of the data as so.

481
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:46,925
Scott: over time People took this multiple spreadsheet database idea where the sheets linked to it.

482
00:33:46,945 --> 00:33:48,270
Scott: They're called tables on by the way.

483
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:49,621
Scott: Yeah, no one calls them spreadsheet.

484
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:54,710
Rym: We're certain babies first But I promise we're gonna skip from that to the rid the modern usage of day.

485
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:55,976
Scott: So here's the modern usage.

486
00:33:56,056 --> 00:34:01,750
Scott: right is basically over time this basic model of having Tables that link to each other to store your data.

487
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:06,606
Scott: They added features and they added features and added features and added features to where know it?

488
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:11,248
Scott: how you're gonna manage this Software with all these features they've added is a job in and of itself.

489
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,713
Scott: Yep Indexes.

490
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:15,061
Scott: they've added sharding.

491
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:18,884
Scott: they've added master-slave configurations and replication.

492
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:22,734
Rym: they've added transactionalism Atomic updates.

493
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:32,078
Scott: It's like there's just so views and triggers and fucking stored procedures The bane of my existence a decade ago.

494
00:34:32,098 --> 00:34:41,070
Scott: They've added so many goddamn features to these things special kinds of columns that Searches, it's like the amount of features that have been added to databases.

495
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,253
Scott: It's any.

496
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:51,610
Scott: it's good that these features are there because if you're making software that uses one of these databases You don't need to reinvent the wheel because the database probably already has the feature you want.

497
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,514
Scott: You don't have to code it again.

498
00:34:52,534 --> 00:34:55,210
Scott: You're to code a search because the database has a search.

499
00:34:55,572 --> 00:34:58,085
Scott: Just need had to learn how to access that search function.

500
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,110
Scott: It's already in the database.

501
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:13,970
Rym: so without getting into the details of all those things the real gist of this is that the place you use a relational database today is when you have a large amount of Structured data that needs to be accessed by multiple different actors.

502
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:19,498
Scott: Well, I mean even if you're used just having something that only needs to be accessed by one actor Oh, yeah, you have added h2.

503
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:24,942
Scott: or if you had structured data There's a thing called SQLite which is a really it's.

504
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:27,450
Scott: you would not believe how often this thing is used.

505
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:30,750
Scott: You probably have like a hundred instances of it running on your computer.

506
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:37,870
Scott: Yeah You don't even know about it Like every browser uses it to store like your cookies and shit and like it's everywhere just hidden.

507
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:43,173
Scott: It's SQLite and what it does is it runs a relational database Inside of a file.

508
00:35:43,534 --> 00:35:53,230
Scott: it so it lets people who are coding code with SQL just like they're using a relational database Except instead of having a server and all this multi-user stuff.

509
00:35:53,331 --> 00:35:56,550
Scott: It just saves the whole database in a file and it's really small and fast.

510
00:35:56,851 --> 00:36:04,760
Scott: So if you're ever writing like a game and you want to have a database in the game and it's just a single-player local game Like a phone or something use SQLite.

511
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:08,623
Scott: your phone probably has like a hundred SQLites are running like it's a better question.

512
00:36:08,643 --> 00:36:09,992
Rym: that is What.

513
00:36:10,073 --> 00:36:12,541
Rym: what are the benefits of relational database overall?

514
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:15,030
Rym: because it mostly comes down to like we said data integrity.

515
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,682
Scott: Alright, so the first benefit is basically that it's so used.

516
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:20,424
Scott: right.

517
00:36:20,485 --> 00:36:22,951
Scott: my SQL Postgres MS SQL.

518
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:29,650
Rym: anyone who knows the basics of technology and has worked in technology knows SQL enough to write a select state, right?

519
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:35,950
Scott: So SQL is basically this language the structured query language and you use it to communicate with these databases.

520
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,590
Scott: You can use it to make tables, you know change.

521
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:45,797
Rym: This is important because in theory you can write the same SQL queries Against a database.

522
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:47,745
Rym: It doesn't matter what the thing is.

523
00:36:47,846 --> 00:36:48,810
Rym: It's querying the database.

524
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:51,910
Rym: The idea is that any application any programming language?

525
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,988
Rym: You could literally be chiseling ones and zeros onto a stone and then reading them in.

526
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:59,580
Rym: somehow SQL is SQL.

527
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,168
Scott: the problem is a big asterisk.

528
00:37:01,209 --> 00:37:04,319
Scott: at the end I like I've written the same SQL.

529
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:07,790
Scott: that's worked pretty much exactly the same with Postgres to my SQL.

530
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:11,643
Scott: There's obviously some differences but MS SQL.

531
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,490
Scott: I just I've had to do some of that recently.

532
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:14,955
Scott: Yeah, it's like I tried to do.

533
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:19,290
Scott: just select star limit a thousand which means select everything from this table.

534
00:37:19,732 --> 00:37:22,125
Scott: Only show me a thousand rows though in case the tables too big.

535
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:22,930
Scott: I don't want to see all the rows.

536
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,425
Scott: I just want to get a sampling right and nope in Microsoft SQL.

537
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:31,359
Scott: It's select top 1000 star from now the way around this.

538
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,790
Rym: in the modern world if you're doing a big database really is that usually your applications?

539
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:38,510
Rym: Especially if it's like a UI in the web or something.

540
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:44,270
Rym: They're not like actively making raw SQL queries every time you do something.

541
00:37:44,591 --> 00:37:53,390
Rym: Usually there's some middle tier in the way that presents API's and on the back end of those API's are well formatted highly optimized SQL queries.

542
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:56,761
Scott: Anyway, so SQL is this language.

543
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:59,050
Scott: I highly recommend anyone who does technology work.

544
00:37:59,090 --> 00:37:59,655
Scott: You should learn it.

545
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,450
Scott: if you don't know it already learn the basics of it.

546
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:07,739
Rym: I don't care if you know like how to do a left out Go to terminal type SQLite.

547
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,763
Scott: It should show up.

548
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:10,350
Scott: It's almost guaranteed to be installed.

549
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,002
Scott: If it's not, it should be easy to install.

550
00:38:12,043 --> 00:38:12,304
Scott: It's free.

551
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,050
Scott: It's open source.

552
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:19,430
Scott: and then just you know do I think it's slash question mark to bring up the help or dot help or something like that?

553
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:37,303
Scott: to bring up the help and just start reading and then get a little SQL guide and like a SQL babies first and Make a table and then like select fill the table with people like and names and contact info and then like Get all the people who live in New York or something like that, right and just learn the basics.

554
00:38:37,825 --> 00:38:38,747
Scott: and it's really.

555
00:38:38,828 --> 00:38:39,650
Scott: it's like plain English.

556
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:52,390
Scott: It's not something that's like select star from cities where right city Something select name phone number from contact info where state equals, New York.

557
00:38:52,856 --> 00:38:59,625
Scott: It's like, you know That's literally what you type in and then it will select the names and phone numbers of everyone in that table who lives in New York.

558
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:02,340
Scott: New York in the state column.

559
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:13,310
Rym: So another big advantage of relational databases is the fact that they you sort of Intrinsically set up your cardinality as in how your different pieces of data relate to each other.

560
00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:14,350
Rym: This is that question.

561
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:18,822
Rym: Like well one Scott can have many games but many games can only have one.

562
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:21,950
Rym: Scott like those kinds of questions it forces.

563
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:25,950
Rym: Does your design to address those questions?

564
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:26,811
Scott: Right.

565
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:35,771
Scott: So as you're designing your database, you know You answer all these questions and then when you're actually making your application your database will prevent you from messing up right.

566
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:43,370
Scott: even for things like okay, I've decided that names of These things cannot be longer than a hundred characters.

567
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:48,086
Scott: So that column in that in the database only supports a hundred characters and then someone tries to type one in.

568
00:39:48,106 --> 00:39:48,487
Scott: that's 101 characters.

569
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:49,652
Scott: They didn't.

570
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:54,412
Scott: they mess up the validation on the on the form on the website and someone types in something's 101.

571
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:56,085
Scott: It won't get inserted in the database.

572
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:56,649
Scott: They'll be an error.

573
00:39:56,991 --> 00:39:59,910
Scott: Yeah, right it forces you to stick to all your rules.

574
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:07,546
Scott: You if you make it so that you know Each person can only you know own one game and you try to add another game to a person.

575
00:40:07,566 --> 00:40:08,630
Scott: It won't let you.

576
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:12,510
Scott: Right, you know your data structure is like set in stones.

577
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,929
Scott: You have all these rules and you're prevented from breaking them and that's actually a good thing.

578
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:25,490
Rym: Now one thing that a lot of people seem to mess up is Whether just because you have a relational database doesn't mean that it's necessarily acid compliant.

579
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:32,269
Rym: And even if that database could be acid compliant a lot of default settings will make it not compliant Yep.

580
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:35,890
Scott: So even when things are as a compliant people still have timing issues and stuff.

581
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,550
Rym: So I had to look it up because I never remember fully what acid stands for but I know what it is.

582
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,654
Rym: Do you remember?

583
00:40:40,674 --> 00:40:41,517
Rym: because I just pulled it up.

584
00:40:41,618 --> 00:40:44,068
Rym: I forgot the what the I make.

585
00:40:44,248 --> 00:40:48,537
Rym: Yep Consistent consistent the I is the one I forgot.

586
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:52,330
Scott: item potent isolated isolated and durable.

587
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,139
Rym: But here's what this comes down to.

588
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,510
Rym: there's two fundamental ways to set up your database in this regard.

589
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:05,913
Rym: So say I am adding Scott to some like I'm making a big update where I'm gonna add Scott and I'm gonna add a bunch Of games to Scott.

590
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:09,930
Rym: Let's say that in the course of adding Scott I fail.

591
00:41:10,932 --> 00:41:17,430
Rym: But then all my things to add games succeed like I put Scott's name in wrong.

592
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:21,944
Rym: So now I've got all these games that I added but they're referencing a key that doesn't exist.

593
00:41:21,964 --> 00:41:22,706
Rym: There's no Scott.

594
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:23,228
Scott: That's no good.

595
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:39,377
Rym: So Atomicity or at atomic operations is the idea that you chunk several related Operations into one transaction and if any one of those steps along the way fails You back out the entire change.

596
00:41:39,618 --> 00:41:42,487
Rym: so you can never get your database into an inconsistent state.

597
00:41:42,507 --> 00:41:51,570
Scott: you group a hundred commands together into one big chunk and it starts doing them in order But if at any point it fails it can undo all of them and go back to where it started.

598
00:41:52,253 --> 00:42:01,570
Scott: Also, let's say I'm in the middle of doing these hundred things and I'm like I'm at number 50 and things are going along nicely and someone else comes along and does a query because it's multi-user, right?

599
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,250
Scott: Yeah, someone else comes along and ask the database or something.

600
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:07,066
Scott: They won't see any of the 50 things that happened already.

601
00:42:07,288 --> 00:42:07,630
Scott: now there's.

602
00:42:08,313 --> 00:42:13,376
Scott: They will not be able to see those changes until they are all done 100% and then they're locked in.

603
00:42:13,396 --> 00:42:16,570
Scott: and then from then on anyone who queries when I'll see all those changes.

604
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:23,770
Rym: Yep now that's both isolation and consistency and actually the isolation part gets really fascinating like here's that we'll go a little deeper into how this stuff

605
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:37,070
Scott: most of these things happen because you have multiple people working on the database if you ever had multiple people working on a Google sheet at the time with those little colored boxes.

606
00:42:37,572 --> 00:42:41,163
Scott: But imagine if you're all working in Excel and someone just saves the fight you somewhat.

607
00:42:41,484 --> 00:42:48,990
Scott: you both open a spreadsheet at the same time On your computers you save it to the shared directory and then someone else doesn't load in your changes.

608
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,509
Scott: They just save right over and blew it all your work away.

609
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:53,317
Rym: now Arguably that was solved by web dev.

610
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,985
Rym: but whoever fucking got web dev door.

611
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:56,170
Scott: No, this is salt, right?

612
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,324
Scott: This is why use a relational database and not a spreadsheet, right?

613
00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:02,423
Scott: Yeah, like an Excel spreadsheet Spreadsheets are for accounting and math.

614
00:43:02,443 --> 00:43:03,430
Scott: They're not for data.

615
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:06,544
Rym: but here's an example of two ways to handle that situation.

616
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:10,580
Rym: and this is where not every like databases are complex enough.

617
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:25,190
Rym: now to where if you're gonna use one if for real and It's not just like a local tiny embedded database that only your application is using like a real big iron shared database You should have someone on your team who is a database expert because this stuff gets real complicated in a hurry.

618
00:43:25,632 --> 00:43:30,490
Rym: So there's there's a bunch of ways to handle that situation where multiple people are working with the database.

619
00:43:30,912 --> 00:43:34,527
Rym: So one way is locks say I am reading it.

620
00:43:34,627 --> 00:43:35,250
Rym: I have a query.

621
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:40,707
Rym: I'm asking the database a question in the middle and see my question takes 10 seconds to answer.

622
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:41,730
Scott: Well, it's a long time.

623
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,119
Scott: Yeah, four seconds a problem benefits.

624
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:47,210
Rym: Scott tries to make a change to the database.

625
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:54,558
Rym: So one way to handle this is that until my my select query is done the database tables I'm querying from our locked.

626
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,690
Rym: Scott's change just gets queued up.

627
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:05,715
Rym: You can't make the change till I'm done asking my question because otherwise I might ask for the 50 states and It just gives me Rhode Island back.

628
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:14,602
Rym: Scott inserts March and then it gives me smarts back and then Scott realized the smarts was wrong And remove smarts and I get more or fewer results than I expected.

629
00:44:14,622 --> 00:44:15,304
Rym: Mm-hmm.

630
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:16,930
Rym: Things could go real south in a hurry.

631
00:44:17,131 --> 00:44:22,390
Rym: Yeah, but the problem with locks are that your database's performance is now garbage.

632
00:44:22,682 --> 00:44:25,762
Scott: Yeah Everyone's just said everyone's trying to use this database all at the same time.

633
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:30,841
Scott: They're just waiting like you have a computer Trying to write a comment on a blog post.

634
00:44:30,862 --> 00:44:32,410
Scott: You got to wait for everyone else's comment.

635
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:33,314
Rym: Yep, you know what?

636
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:36,386
Rym: It's like if your database is now boo and every time you look at him.

637
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:37,069
Rym: He stops moving.

638
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:44,017
Scott: Unless you're the only one looking at him then he'll open his eyes for so in isolated and consistent way to do this.

639
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:55,856
Rym: and this is how I back when I did some database administration, which was Before 2008. at this point so a decade ago with Postgres you can set up concurrency and clever locking.

640
00:44:56,238 --> 00:45:08,230
Rym: so an example would be every time I start a Select query the state of the delve all the tables that I am looking at is almost Snapshotted and saved and its own copy.

641
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:15,825
Rym: So my query even if it's long-running can finish Against the state of the database as it was when I began my query.

642
00:45:16,187 --> 00:45:23,557
Rym: if Scott makes updates He's making them to the real database, but I won't see them because his updates were after I started my select Mm-hmm.

643
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:31,672
Rym: That means Scott can write to the database all he wants while I'm reading But you can imagine there are ways for that to go south to Every.

644
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:37,710
Rym: the query makes its own snapshot of all the tables that can add up in a hurry and cause its own performance problems.

645
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:40,470
Scott: Alright, so this brings to another thing which is okay.

646
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:51,490
Scott: You've got this system that's being used by a zillion people and we've solved all these problems so they can all use it But even though we've sort of made it possible So that the data won't get messed up or anything like that or no one has to wait.

647
00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:55,550
Scott: It still takes a lot of computing power to do all this, right?

648
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:03,314
Scott: So there's a lot of the things that are features of relational databases are things to just improve performance and you might not even know They're there right.

649
00:46:03,374 --> 00:46:08,770
Rym: cashing indices multiple indices Pre-calculated results tables, right?

650
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:21,090
Scott: So indices are like the most common one and it's basically an index is Basically a fancy like lookup that lets you know It's the way the data is that because the data is in the end still in a file somewhere on a hard drive, right?

651
00:46:21,391 --> 00:46:22,637
Scott: Even though it's not a file.

652
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:25,150
Scott: It's like a fancy server that's in between you and the file.

653
00:46:25,551 --> 00:46:29,549
Scott: It's still a file or files right on hard drive somewhere where the data is.

654
00:46:30,011 --> 00:46:35,410
Scott: So the index is basically a fancy thing that helps it search the data faster.

655
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:37,410
Scott: It's sort of like okay a man, you know.

656
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:42,390
Rym: It's like look at the index of a phone book and it tells you what page to start looking for a phone number on right?

657
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:49,009
Scott: It's like so if I say, you know select from the table all the you know, the names that begin with B It's like aha.

658
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:54,150
Scott: Well, I know it doesn't have to look through every single frickin name and the whole million row table.

659
00:46:54,210 --> 00:47:04,167
Scott: It can do it a lot faster because it has this index files that it built and keeps updated as the data changes so that It can execute the queries faster by referring to these lookups to begin with.

660
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:10,968
Scott: Yep So another big thing which is related to a Rym is talking about before is you know, you have so many users.

661
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:15,610
Scott: your computer You know that's running the database is even though it's really not finely tuned.

662
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:17,399
Scott: You only have so much CPU so much RAM.

663
00:47:17,439 --> 00:47:19,710
Rym: you want to distribute that shit across a bunch of computers.

664
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:20,235
Scott: That's right.

665
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:21,710
Scott: You got to get more computers in the mix.

666
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:24,178
Scott: You get a one database running on many computers.

667
00:47:24,499 --> 00:47:27,710
Scott: that way you can get more users because you know back in the day what people?

668
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,783
Scott: Would do is they would just get a bigger computer.

669
00:47:29,843 --> 00:47:30,870
Scott: and that was a strategy.

670
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,218
Scott: You know why that was the strategy.

671
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,996
Scott: that was the strategy because Microsoft Windows cost money.

672
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:43,138
Scott: if you had Microsoft Windows and MS SQL Server and you wanted to get two computers You had to buy licenses again, and they weren't cheap.

673
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,050
Rym: now like Oracle and people they link it to CPU cores for their licenses.

674
00:47:47,552 --> 00:47:48,336
Scott: Right, and it's like.

675
00:47:48,376 --> 00:47:49,622
Scott: well that you know.

676
00:47:49,722 --> 00:47:51,410
Scott: Oracle also get to buy more Oracle.

677
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,029
Scott: You have to give them more money when you want to get more computers in the mix.

678
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,735
Scott: Well, guess what Linux?

679
00:47:55,775 --> 00:47:57,520
Scott: it cost zero dollars right?

680
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,413
Scott: Postgres and MySQL are free unless you get the paid MySQL Which you don't want.

681
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:02,638
Rym: yep and Postgres like.

682
00:48:02,698 --> 00:48:06,074
Scott: honestly Postgres is better than MySQL and it's free I've been using.

683
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:08,083
Rym: I used Postgres before.

684
00:48:08,103 --> 00:48:09,610
Rym: it was kind of super production ready.

685
00:48:10,111 --> 00:48:13,843
Rym: Postgres is like the one to use if you don't know what you want to use.

686
00:48:13,863 --> 00:48:22,990
Scott: Postgres and MySQL are super production ready But if you're a database nerd, you'll hate MySQL and like Postgres better, but there are big-time companies using MySQL super well.

687
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:27,646
Scott: So the thing is is basically MySQL is a little bit more user-friendly.

688
00:48:27,706 --> 00:48:33,588
Scott: if you're just setting up a blog Probably just go with that and then if you're doing anything serious, you better not use MySQL.

689
00:48:33,608 --> 00:48:35,115
Scott: if you're a bank Don't use MySQL.

690
00:48:35,276 --> 00:48:40,849
Rym: So in the old days though to get it back to Scott's distributed model Yeah, distributing a database was a giant pain in the ass.

691
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:41,995
Scott: Oh huge pain in the ass.

692
00:48:42,055 --> 00:48:44,367
Rym: like to get a distributed Postgres set up.

693
00:48:44,608 --> 00:48:46,616
Rym: good God We ended up in MySQL.

694
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:50,250
Scott: actually made it a little bit easier before Postgres did but now Postgres also makes it.

695
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,236
Rym: Postgres has this stuff built in but it used.

696
00:48:52,256 --> 00:49:04,985
Rym: I used to have to do stuff like Put the binary transaction logs of Postgres on a DRBD volume and have that Replicate to another place and have a post grab another Postgres running in read-only mode.

697
00:49:05,246 --> 00:49:06,690
Rym: that happened to also look at that day.

698
00:49:06,992 --> 00:49:07,516
Rym: It was a mess.

699
00:49:07,556 --> 00:49:09,550
Scott: So what most people do and what's sufficient?

700
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,857
Rym: We don't even tell you what I did for MySQL back then.

701
00:49:12,098 --> 00:49:15,470
Scott: what's sufficient for most applications to have a master slave set up?

702
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,256
Scott: So way this works.

703
00:49:16,296 --> 00:49:18,270
Scott: is you have one server that runs a database normally.

704
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:28,730
Scott: Then what you do is that server whenever it receives instructions to add data It will send those instructions to other computers also running the same exact database.

705
00:49:29,272 --> 00:49:38,598
Scott: So you go to the the master and you say insert a new person into that table and it does and then it tells this Other computer hey insert this person into that table.

706
00:49:38,698 --> 00:49:51,442
Scott: Okay, but that other one the slave right the the poorly named slave database Doesn't accept inserts or updates or data change SQL statements from anyone except that master database.

707
00:49:51,462 --> 00:49:55,278
Scott: if you tried to go there and insert it would say sorry I can't answer I can only select.

708
00:49:55,479 --> 00:49:59,495
Scott: Yeah, so that way now you can write all your applications To where.

709
00:49:59,535 --> 00:50:09,207
Scott: when they need to read data or select from the database They make their selects on one of your one or more of your slave databases And then if they need to insert they send it to the master.

710
00:50:09,287 --> 00:50:14,404
Scott: and now All the inserts go to one computer and all the selects go to all these other computers.

711
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:20,517
Scott: this those slaves might fall a little Like a few seconds behind the master one so you might have some data timing issues.

712
00:50:20,557 --> 00:50:26,247
Scott: a lot of times you'll have a situation like you go insert and then immediately select and The thing you just insert it isn't there.

713
00:50:26,308 --> 00:50:28,214
Scott: yet That happens a lot.

714
00:50:28,616 --> 00:50:29,900
Rym: There's clever ways around.

715
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:32,370
Scott: there are a lot of clever ways around it, but that's not a scope for this.

716
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:39,425
Scott: Yeah the point is is that when you have this kind of setup a lot of Selects will actually use a lot of computer horsepower.

717
00:50:39,465 --> 00:50:44,666
Scott: if they're complicated and Net you're be preventing people from inserting when you make those selects.

718
00:50:45,048 --> 00:50:48,825
Scott: now They have people inserting all day because that's real easy to insert.

719
00:50:48,865 --> 00:50:50,030
Scott: It's always real easy to insert.

720
00:50:50,150 --> 00:51:02,790
Scott: It's like takes almost no computing power to insert unless you've got stupid indexes that are busted Or you've got long running stored procedures for some reason don't do that Right, and now people can select freely and if they tie up a whole computer selecting no big deal.

721
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,203
Scott: We got like a hundred slaves, but this only solves the problem.

722
00:51:06,223 --> 00:51:10,056
Rym: where you have right few read many Architecture in your actual application.

723
00:51:10,197 --> 00:51:15,940
Rym: Yeah, if you're if you have a lot of things all trying to write to the names database at the Same time this doesn't help you at all.

724
00:51:16,162 --> 00:51:20,000
Rym: Oh and The solution to that are actually way even more complicated.

725
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,367
Scott: most applications are right few read many.

726
00:51:22,408 --> 00:51:23,130
Scott: That is true, right?

727
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:23,894
Scott: You got a blog.

728
00:51:23,935 --> 00:51:24,861
Scott: you got some website.

729
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:26,170
Scott: How much writing is going on?

730
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,810
Scott: How often do you update the website with a new blog post once a day, right?

731
00:51:30,433 --> 00:51:31,477
Scott: How often do you read?

732
00:51:31,597 --> 00:51:33,766
Scott: you got a million people coming to read the website.

733
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:34,770
Rym: a guy use case.

734
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:36,039
Rym: I've seen though for the situation.

735
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:36,905
Rym: We have a lot of things.

736
00:51:37,026 --> 00:51:50,390
Rym: writing is usually around Disaster recovery failover environments where you want to have a hot hot system Yeah, where your primary and your backups are all hot and can be used as production at the same time.

737
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,635
Scott: Yep, if any if you're mad Slave goes down.

738
00:51:53,675 --> 00:51:56,830
Scott: Well, you have a hundred computers or however many usually you don't need a hundred.

739
00:51:56,891 --> 00:51:57,750
Scott: I'm just making up a number.

740
00:51:58,192 --> 00:52:01,143
Scott: Usually it's like master and a couple slaves and that gets you a big.

741
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:03,348
Scott: that gets you a lot of users when you just have that many.

742
00:52:04,594 --> 00:52:05,649
Scott: It's like oh one went down.

743
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,510
Scott: Well, we have a full copy of the database and the same exact software running on all these computers.

744
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:13,063
Scott: Just make another one be the master now and fix the master that broke.

745
00:52:13,324 --> 00:52:19,790
Rym: but I guess well say in terms of that failover Disaster recovery thing is that hot cold is real easy to do with relational databases.

746
00:52:20,212 --> 00:52:29,689
Rym: Hot warm is actually really easy to do in terms of right access Hot hot where both sides or you know end sides can all be have inserts running at the same time.

747
00:52:30,991 --> 00:52:37,129
Rym: It's not hard to do anymore in the sense that a lot of databases have functions to do this built-in.

748
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:40,380
Rym: like you guys It's a configuration challenge in the old days.

749
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:46,361
Rym: It was nigh impossible the way I did it 20 or 15 years ago and you should not do it this way is.

750
00:52:46,421 --> 00:52:47,885
Rym: I had to my sequel databases.

751
00:52:48,527 --> 00:52:50,496
Rym: one of them It's indexing.

752
00:52:50,576 --> 00:52:54,914
Rym: its indices were hard-coded to increment as Even integers.

753
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:55,456
Rym: Mm-hmm.

754
00:52:55,756 --> 00:53:00,870
Rym: And the other one was hard coded to increment increment its rights with its indices odd numbered integers.

755
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:08,210
Rym: So there could never be a conflict if you wrote to either one and they both had binary transaction logs pointed at each other.

756
00:53:08,993 --> 00:53:09,918
Scott: Do not do that.

757
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:12,210
Scott: No, so that does remind me.

758
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:16,249
Scott: There is the thing that's very popular these days when you get really massive, which is called sharding.

759
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:16,450
Scott: and when?

760
00:53:17,514 --> 00:53:19,040
Scott: You do a sharding right.

761
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:24,203
Scott: it's like okay, it's like an MMO is actually right Right sharding is sort of what MMOs do.

762
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:25,550
Scott: Yeah, it's like, okay.

763
00:53:25,771 --> 00:53:30,310
Scott: Well, we've got this huge database, but you know, it has like all the names of all our users.

764
00:53:30,392 --> 00:53:30,969
Scott: But you know what?

765
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:34,145
Scott: We don't really often have to search through all the users.

766
00:53:34,246 --> 00:53:39,890
Scott: most of the time We're only searching through a subset of the users divided by say region, right?

767
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:40,491
Scott: They've got.

768
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:46,030
Scott: the US office is only really searching the US users and the Europe office is only searching the Europe users.

769
00:53:46,373 --> 00:53:46,858
Scott: So, you know what?

770
00:53:46,878 --> 00:53:47,930
Scott: Well, it'll still be the same.

771
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:54,662
Scott: We still want to combine everything because occasionally we do want to just search everything But most of the time we're like 90% of the time.

772
00:53:54,682 --> 00:53:56,630
Scott: We're only searching one section, right?

773
00:53:56,891 --> 00:53:59,608
Scott: So what we'll do is we'll take the database and we'll chop it up.

774
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:06,291
Scott: Well, even though it's the same table We'll put all the US users on this server the Europe users on that server or you know You might.

775
00:54:06,552 --> 00:54:08,439
Scott: how you divide it depends on your application.

776
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:10,867
Scott: right you to divide by you know region?

777
00:54:10,907 --> 00:54:15,530
Scott: you could divide by Alphabetical, yeah, you divide by all sorts of things whatever makes sense.

778
00:54:16,752 --> 00:54:19,490
Scott: Writing say website like reddit you might divide by subreddit.

779
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:26,413
Scott: It's like all the data for this subreddit all the comments all this stuff is in this database server and all this other subreddit is On this other database.

780
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:30,750
Rym: I read it a problem once with sharding or it was a. we were doing effectively sharding.

781
00:54:30,831 --> 00:54:32,390
Rym: This is that two jobs again.

782
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:38,670
Scott: But now all the queries related to one subset of your application go to the same place and now you can balance the load.

783
00:54:38,871 --> 00:54:41,204
Scott: Really popular subreddit while it gets its own database server.

784
00:54:41,224 --> 00:54:42,250
Scott: all these unpopular ones.

785
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:44,450
Scott: We can all cluster them together on the same server.

786
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:51,960
Rym: So we sharted market data like market data from the stock market based on The alphabet like the letter that the ticker started with.

787
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:55,655
Scott: so all this all the stocks that begin with a or on the server All the ones begin to be around.

788
00:54:55,695 --> 00:54:56,620
Rym: Yeah, that was fine.

789
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,650
Rym: Except that s was a problem.

790
00:54:59,101 --> 00:54:59,969
Scott: Yeah, no You just you know.

791
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:05,250
Scott: I'm saying you had to give two servers to s and you can put qz and whatever all on the same server together.

792
00:55:05,571 --> 00:55:11,410
Rym: Yeah, but sharding requires you to analyze and understand the usage patterns of your database.

793
00:55:11,832 --> 00:55:13,623
Scott: This is why you have that person at your company.

794
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,930
Scott: Who is the database person?

795
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:19,137
Rym: There's a reason why you can get a degree in database Administration person if you.

796
00:55:19,237 --> 00:55:21,385
Scott: if they do they'll just know to do some sharding.

797
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:22,830
Scott: They'll know to optimize some indexes.

798
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:28,830
Scott: They do all these things on the database server and all the people using the database Don't even know that any of this is going on.

799
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:33,826
Scott: all they're doing is connecting and typing SQL and the results always come back and they don't know.

800
00:55:33,906 --> 00:55:44,303
Scott: any of this stuff happened because Abstraction layer going on right and but meanwhile you can have so many more users so much more reliable data So much more safety for the data.

801
00:55:44,343 --> 00:55:45,130
Scott: Nothing will happen to it.

802
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:48,923
Scott: They'll always be safe and all these great things happen completely behind the scenes.

803
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:50,710
Scott: So that's why people use databases.

804
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:56,209
Rym: I spent a decade and not an excels administering databases in the course of my work and I'm glad to never do that again.

805
00:55:58,013 --> 00:56:00,369
Rym: I will just share an anecdote from when I went to RIT.

806
00:56:00,571 --> 00:56:10,190
Rym: I was a pre freshman and I had to decide what major Like am I gonna do IT or am I gonna do computer science or all these things and even within IT?

807
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:20,422
Rym: Now they've changed it They've split it out more but IT had all these different concentrations and one of the things you could focus on in IT Was database administration and the way database administration.

808
00:56:20,442 --> 00:56:25,990
Rym: because IT you had to take classes in every discipline And then from there you'd pick a few specialties.

809
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:36,142
Rym: so we had took our initial classes on like database administration and they told us in every one of these classes if You specialize in database administration.

810
00:56:36,403 --> 00:56:48,529
Rym: You will make a shit ton of money immediately out of college and I heard that I Understood that I took my database classes and I said that ain't worth it and I didn't want that money.

811
00:56:49,411 --> 00:56:57,729
Rym: so I don't know if you necessarily want to be a database administrator because you will be a database administrator forever if you Get really good at it.

812
00:56:57,971 --> 00:57:07,842
Scott: A lot of people who were previously database administrators are now like calling themselves things like data Scientist or you know things like that.

813
00:57:07,862 --> 00:57:10,010
Rym: They do not want to optimize your Postgres database.

814
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:17,570
Scott: Right, you know this or like, you know information something something Like all these kinds of other, you know adjacent.

815
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:22,970
Scott: Yeah, you know like, you know, they're trying to you know, be like I'll be like a machine learning person.

816
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:24,456
Scott: They're trying to move away from.

817
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:27,690
Scott: you know, I'm an information manager or something, right?

818
00:57:27,951 --> 00:57:40,608
Rym: Unlike a lot of things if you want if you want to learn database administration and you can't afford to go to college Databases are some of the most well documented things there are.

819
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:41,770
Scott: and free Yeah.

820
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:48,988
Rym: You can download Postgres run it on a Linux box professional enterprise quality level database the documentation.

821
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:53,318
Rym: That's free Documentation super detailed super good.

822
00:57:53,398 --> 00:57:57,570
Scott: You just become a Postgres master all on your own and then easily make jobs and money.

823
00:57:57,812 --> 00:58:05,507
Rym: I think you could learn Database administration on your own on the internet for free easier than you can learn most programming.

824
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:09,289
Rym: Yeah, probably Yeah, just the resources are more consistent.

825
00:58:09,915 --> 00:58:15,950
Scott: SQL is Is pretty solid and it's the hard part really is learning just the fundamental concepts.

826
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:23,410
Scott: Yeah, and not because the documentation is mostly gonna tell you like here's this command Here's what it does and you might not understand all the language in the documentation.

827
00:58:24,891 --> 00:58:27,510
Rym: Blah blah equals foo insert foo come in.

828
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:38,230
Scott: You might need to get like a book with an animal on it to talk about, you know, the the general like, you know Scope of things and you can literally vocabulary and then everything else will be easy.

829
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:48,110
Rym: But I guess the experimentation and like the practical knowledge is way easy to learn because kind of like a Python interpreter You can literally just log into your database from a command line and start asking it questions.

830
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,959
Scott: There's also tons of free GUI tools.

831
00:58:49,979 --> 00:58:52,210
Scott: You can use to look at your database like it's a spreadsheet.

832
00:58:52,372 --> 00:58:53,967
Scott: You don't have to even learn how to use.

833
00:58:55,113 --> 00:58:56,781
Scott: You know the command line, right?

834
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:58,810
Scott: You can just use the GUI and type your stuff in there.

835
00:58:59,091 --> 00:59:06,074
Rym: My real advice to you is don't use a no sequel solution unless you understand They're pretty much dead.

836
00:59:06,154 --> 00:59:10,530
Rym: unless you understand why you can't use an acid compliant real relational database, right?

837
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,192
Scott: You'd be surprised.

838
00:59:11,212 --> 00:59:13,261
Scott: like it the relational databases.

839
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:15,390
Scott: The SQL databases are so flexible.

840
00:59:15,932 --> 00:59:21,070
Scott: You know that it's like almost every application out there can is like you can use one.

841
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:30,098
Rym: Well, the worst case is when you see people implement a non-relational database and then over the course of building their thing end up Reinventing acid, right?

842
00:59:30,158 --> 00:59:30,359
Scott: It's like.

843
00:59:30,379 --> 00:59:32,929
Rym: reinventing acid is like a thing that people do.

844
00:59:33,273 --> 00:59:34,250
Scott: It's like using, you know.

845
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:39,029
Scott: Sometimes people use UDP instead of TCP because they need the performance and then they really meant TCP, right?

846
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:44,556
Scott: And they re-implement TCP only do it if you're re-implementing part of TCP Not all of TCP.

847
00:59:44,676 --> 00:59:48,610
Scott: if you re-implemented all of TCP and UDP you should use TCP to begin with.

848
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,998
Scott: Yep, if your UDP is it your.

849
00:59:51,018 --> 00:59:54,510
Scott: you know layers on UDP have made it so slow that it's not faster.

850
00:59:54,934 --> 00:59:56,270
Scott: You wasted your time, right?

851
00:59:56,852 --> 01:00:05,230
Scott: So yeah But you know if you're making any software at all and you suddenly Realize I need a place to store all this data and I might want to search it.

852
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:07,104
Scott: Just pick a relational database.

853
01:00:07,185 --> 01:00:21,550
Scott: use SQLite if you only if it's a local one person application and use MySQL or Postgres if it's a multi-person application that has a server and Just start from there and only change if you absolutely have to and you're smart enough to realize it's not work.

854
01:00:27,205 --> 01:00:29,740
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

855
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,540
Rym: Special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

856
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:36,828
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

857
01:00:36,868 --> 01:00:39,860
Scott: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

858
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:47,180
Rym: Remember GeekNights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

860
01:00:52,342 --> 01:00:57,020
Scott: GeekNights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows.

861
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:11,518
Scott: It's actually recorded at night and the patreon.
