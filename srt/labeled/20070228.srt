1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,049
Rym: It's Wednesday, February 28th.

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:12,931
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:15,840
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,018
Rym: We reviewed the New York comic-con at the Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

5
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:22,317
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:28,845
Rym: So for the first time in a long time, I'm actually a little excited about an anime coming out Really?

7
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:30,093
Rym: Well Scott downloaded.

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:39,120
Rym: we finally watched this preview trailer interview special for this new anime called Moonlight Mile that's debuting in Japan in a few days.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:52,355
Scott: Yeah, usually, you know previews what you download for anime, you know Tend to be really short and they don't tell you much about the show But I like to download them because it takes like five minutes to get one of these things.

10
00:00:52,375 --> 00:01:02,820
Scott: when they do fan sub them And it just it saves me the trouble of downloading episode 1 And wasting, you know more time in my life trying to figure out if the show was worth watching or not.

11
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:16,164
Rym: Well, the thing is this looks really cool and it looks like kind of this gritty Serious take on exploration and politics and space and I guess it has the potential to be like gassaraki Which is something I really dig.

12
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:34,296
Scott: Well, I think at this point pretty much any anime that isn't high school drama wacky high school crap a fighting show or any of the you know, typical Anime genres that are super popular is the show that we're gonna latch on to?

13
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:52,880
Scott: yeah like ergo proxy It's like if you make a show that's like a serious plot that takes place in sort of the real world like a sci-fi anime or a real horror anime or a Real historical anime and not just samurai fighting Kenshin style.

14
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:53,905
Scott: It doesn't.

15
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:58,653
Scott: you don't have to do that great a job to get us to latch on to it Just because we're desperate at this point.

16
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:08,787
Scott: So Moonlight Mile seems to be a serious show about Explorers and politics in space and Energy and all sorts of stuff.

17
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,551
Scott: So I hope it's good.

18
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:16,119
Scott: And even if it's only kind of good Still kind of reaching here for it.

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,585
Rym: The thing was I had never heard of the guy who directed it at Iku Suzuki as I looked it up and Apparently he hasn't done much.

20
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:28,160
Rym: but he is known for dear s which he worked on not a good show.

21
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:35,123
Rym: Maze which he worked on average as direct average to not good show and it looks like he directed the fake Oav.

22
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,127
Scott: not a good show.

23
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:37,673
Rym: also not that bad of a show.

24
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:38,516
Scott: I never watched it.

25
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:39,520
Scott: I've never seen it either.

26
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,747
Scott: But isn't that a boy a man love show?

27
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:43,071
Rym: It's rated highly.

28
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:43,814
Rym: Uh-huh.

29
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:44,837
Rym: A lot of people like it.

30
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,705
Rym: Alrighty I can't speak on it.

31
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:49,680
Rym: Maybe we'll review it if you guys out there really want us to.

32
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,634
Scott: I just heard that fake was a sort of a boy love show.

33
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:53,719
Scott: So I kind of wrote it off.

34
00:02:55,361 --> 00:03:00,414
Rym: So in the news, I suppose we should talk about that it's over it's done.

35
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:10,893
Rym: the American Anime Awards have finished their scam and With the final tragic, you know, they're gonna do it again next year.

36
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:12,780
Rym: Yeah, we'll see about that.

37
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:17,534
Rym: I'm telling you you me and Daryl Surratt have to make our own anime awards.

38
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:26,220
Scott: I think we should an independent Non Industry body should decide the American Anime Awards for stuff that happened this year only.

39
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:34,286
Scott: Yeah, and if you're gonna do stuff that's if you're gonna give a lifetime achievement award You don't go giving it to who do they give freaking awards to whatever.

40
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:38,138
Rym: I mean our lizard pretty much be Satoshi khan Miyazaki.

41
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:40,660
Scott: Yeah, they're basically before guys.

42
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,396
Scott: Well, maybe five guys winning all the awards and everyone else would get dick.

43
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:48,880
Scott: because well Maybe six guys and if you're not as good as them then you suck.

44
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:51,187
Rym: Yeah, so who did win awards?

45
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:52,651
Rym: I mean we talked about this.

46
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:53,093
Scott: Well, let's see.

47
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:53,835
Scott: Wait.

48
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,119
Scott: I haven't seen the results.

49
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:56,083
Scott: actually I'm not kidding.

50
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:57,309
Rym: I'm looking at him right now.

51
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,371
Scott: All right, so it was fan voting Which is why it sucked the primary reason why it sucked.

52
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:04,600
Scott: So with fan I did see the nominees.

53
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:09,433
Scott: So with fan voting I would say that Naruto had to win at least one award.

54
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:11,419
Rym: Naruto didn't win dick.

55
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:12,262
Scott: Wow Okay.

56
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:12,543
Scott: All right.

57
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:13,246
Scott: Let me try again.

58
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:14,492
Rym: Well, remember I have.

59
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:16,220
Rym: the categories were really weird.

60
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,420
Rym: I mean, they have such things as best male actor in a comedy.

61
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:25,413
Scott: Is it that Vic guy that is everyone's super popular these days?

62
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:27,380
Rym: No, no Vic won an award for something else.

63
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:29,579
Scott: Oh, well, at least I'm getting the right track.

64
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:37,720
Rym: Yeah, no Vic won best actor but not best male actor in a comedy which goes to Dave Wittenberg for Zatch Bell.

65
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,528
Scott: I never even heard of Dave Wittenberg.

66
00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:46,293
Rym: Zatch Bell had best actress in a comedy - Full Metal Alchemist won pretty much every normal award.

67
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:46,996
Scott: Oh, I could.

68
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:47,899
Scott: that was my next guess.

69
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:54,406
Rym: Best actress went to Mary Elizabeth from Ghost in the Shell Standalone complex second gate.

70
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,333
Scott: Oh my god an award that makes sense.

71
00:04:56,393 --> 00:05:00,927
Scott: an anime that came out in the US this year With a great actress.

72
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:01,569
Scott: Holy crap.

73
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,511
Scott: There's one award.

74
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:03,374
Scott: They got one.

75
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:04,477
Rym: Wait, wait, wait, wait, though.

76
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:05,600
Rym: That was for the dub.

77
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:07,066
Scott: Yeah, she was good.

78
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:08,010
Rym: I haven't seen the dub.

79
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,873
Scott: Oh, yeah, she's all right.

80
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:09,295
Scott: Really?

81
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:09,697
Rym: Yeah.

82
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:13,980
Scott: All right That's the only award on there that has any validity at all.

83
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:28,220
Rym: Oh, yeah and remember according to the internet population who voted on the American anime Awards the best manga ever in the History of manga since anything that had been published in the US is up for grabs was fruits basket apparently.

84
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:33,589
Rym: so I guess I gotta throw away all that sanctuary and and Buddha we got laying around.

85
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:41,320
Scott: I guess Osamu Tezuka Katsuhiro Otomo and Masamune Shiro have nothing on I don't know just the popular shoujo of the day.

86
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:42,794
Rym: Yeah, don't forget going a guy.

87
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:49,500
Scott: Yeah Anyway, yeah, I could have guessed that though cuz fruits basket is sort of the number one most popular manga in the US.

88
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:50,658
Scott: So that does make sense.

89
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:54,150
Rym: But oh, well, I just I can't reiterate enough.

90
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,460
Rym: these American anime Awards are such a bullshit scam.

91
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:03,597
Rym: I'm really surprised we haven't been sued or at least threatened for libel or slander, but that's the way it is.

92
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:18,300
Scott: I Think it's just that they wanted to make awards for I don't know because they felt like there weren't any and there had to be And they didn't actually bother to make the awards any good or have any meaning or respect?

93
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,550
Rym: Well, they didn't need to remember the way these things work.

94
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,739
Rym: is it's kind of this industry circle jerk?

95
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,371
Rym: I mean look at the Academy Wars the real Oscars.

96
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,260
Rym: I didn't even realize they happened until recently.

97
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:36,251
Scott: I didn't realize that happened until the day after they happened when everyone started talking about what happened at them and I saw YouTube videos From it, but I never actually saw a list of winners.

98
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,078
Scott: I don't even know what won best picture or anything.

99
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:38,720
Rym: Yeah, me either.

100
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:42,180
Rym: Yeah, I pretty much never cared about in my life and I still don't care about him.

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:51,340
Rym: But yeah from all the people who talk about going Candidly as opposed to the actors who try to pretend like they mean something they always say that it's boring as hell.

102
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,300
Rym: I mean, I think Penn Jillette and teller said something to the effect of every award ceremony ever is just like the high school.

103
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,331
Scott: Whatever Awards, it's so true.

104
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,155
Scott: God so true.

105
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,920
Rym: But yeah, thankfully we won't have to talk about this again.

106
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:13,800
Rym: Hopefully next year, hopefully by next year either We'll be having our own anime Awards or these people will all be dead in a gutter.

107
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:27,636
Scott: I think what we should just do is the anime podcasters should get together every year Get a list of all the manga and all the anime that came out in the u.s That year and then we should pick and it'll just be the American anime podcaster awards.

108
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:29,200
Scott: We'll decide among ourselves.

109
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:33,160
Rym: I think among ourselves by ourselves meaning us and our podcast friends.

110
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:42,697
Rym: We have to decide who counts as an anime podcast Because I looked on dig the other day after I noticed that dig podcast searching was broken as I was trying to find a new podcast to listen to.

111
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:52,002
Rym: Oh And there's a lot of anime podcasts out there now like they're growing exponentially and they all really Suck.

112
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:55,414
Scott: Well, no, it would just be the anime podcasters.

113
00:07:55,454 --> 00:08:02,594
Rym: We know yeah, it would just be us and Fast karate Darryl Surratt and Gerald and Clarissa on anime world order.

114
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:04,760
Rym: Yeah, we just be Ninja Consultants.

115
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,503
Scott: Yeah, that's who.

116
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:08,034
Scott: it would be all those people some weekly anime review.

117
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:08,395
Scott: Yep.

118
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:10,724
Scott: They could be in there, too We wouldn't we?

119
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:14,133
Scott: basically we would make a little coalition amongst ourselves.

120
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:16,600
Scott: You wouldn't just let any anime podcaster vote.

121
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:17,787
Scott: It would be us.

122
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:27,244
Rym: we would all sit down together on Skype or something and discuss the winners amongst ourselves and of course the thing you can do to always at lend Legitimacy to anything like that.

123
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:36,291
Rym: we'd send invitations to all the great directors of anime that are still alive Asking them for their votes on our nominations.

124
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:37,575
Scott: No, we don't need them to vote.

125
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,059
Rym: No, no, we just asked him.

126
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:39,758
Scott: No, no.

127
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:49,736
Scott: What you do is after you pick the winners you send letters to the people who won and if they want they could call in And we'll record like their acceptance speech.

128
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:50,460
Scott: Thank you, whatever.

129
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,639
Rym: No, but before that you see you're missing the point here.

130
00:08:53,102 --> 00:09:03,359
Rym: If you even if no one responds to your letter at all Even if your letter gets lost in the mail You can then legally say that among the voting members of your board include blah blah.

131
00:09:04,642 --> 00:09:05,686
Scott: I know that is necessary.

132
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:06,369
Rym: Why not?

133
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:11,192
Scott: if I think it's I think it's much better to for us We should just do the penny arcade style, but we were right.

134
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:12,780
Rym: awards, you know, they stopped doing that.

135
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:15,519
Scott: Well, that's just yeah, they missed it years and years ago.

136
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:16,484
Scott: Yeah We should.

137
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:17,576
Scott: I think we need to pick it up.

138
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:22,800
Rym: Someone needs to even if not us because the American Anime Awards are a blight upon this earth.

139
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:24,530
Scott: Alright now I was gonna.

140
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:30,900
Scott: let's move on to my news Which is nothing because I was gonna talk about I guess something that was announced.

141
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,220
Scott: I mean the New York Comic Con happens.

142
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:39,364
Scott: We're talking about this show and there were a lot of panels there and you had to imagine among all those panels and now They were all industry panels.

143
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:44,720
Scott: There had to be some news worth talking about but no none of it's really worth talking about.

144
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:55,439
Scott: I mean such-and-such manga was licensed such-and-such comics are gonna come out such-and-such movies are now available Such-and-such people are working on such-and-such thing.

145
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:58,532
Scott: So and so signed a contract with so-and-so.

146
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:00,460
Scott: It's all just information.

147
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:04,010
Scott: None of it is particularly interesting or new or exciting.

148
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:07,260
Scott: You can go read it on newsarama and anime news network.

149
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:09,699
Scott: I'm not gonna bother reiterating it.

150
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,383
Scott: It's not worth it my time or the time in the podcast Of course.

151
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:14,551
Rym: one final thing just so.

152
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:15,960
Rym: you're all aware and you'll be ready for it.

153
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:28,580
Rym: But later in the episode when I get to a certain thing that happened at the CPM booth I am now announcing that I a contest we're going to run for a Somewhat interesting prize that is currently sitting in front of me on my desk.

154
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:30,952
Rym: Uh-oh, but we'll get to that when the time comes.

155
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:32,620
Scott: I was just trying to get rid of crap.

156
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:34,248
Rym: I don't want to spoil.

157
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,640
Scott: we should do is all the crap at our house that we don't want anymore.

158
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,159
Scott: We should just get rid of in contest.

159
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:41,529
Scott: I feel like yeah, I eat this banana.

160
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,012
Scott: I don't need this banana peel anymore.

161
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:45,098
Scott: All right, nice contest for Scott's banana peel.

162
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:50,542
Rym: next Monday We'll have a contest for who can get the 12 inch CRT.

163
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:52,608
Rym: that is sitting under my desk unused.

164
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:58,809
Scott: Oh then after that don't tell him though that the week later There'll be a contest for the 710 inch CRT.

165
00:10:58,849 --> 00:10:59,492
Scott: I'm trying to get rid of.

166
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:01,280
Rym: Oh, don't forget the 40 gig hard drive.

167
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,925
Rym: That doesn't work.

168
00:11:02,348 --> 00:11:03,033
Scott: Whoo.

169
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:03,939
Scott: Good prize.

170
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,952
Rym: So that was kind of awesome.

171
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:20,717
Rym: normally I say things the day right about then but instead for about 10 minutes I was saying such things as motherfucker shit shit shit.

172
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:24,380
Scott: God, damn it crap ass shit motherfucker.

173
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:33,460
Rym: You see between doing the front half of the show in the back half of the show I thought hey, let's get that cool Scott's thing of the day so I can put the audio in the show.

174
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:42,839
Rym: So I started fiddling with my awesome mixer to record it and that Causes my awesome mixer to crap itself partly because my computer is physically a nightmare mess.

175
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:46,410
Scott: And you're holding out replacing it until the summer.

176
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:48,537
Scott: God knows why you should have replaced it last summer.

177
00:11:48,557 --> 00:12:00,143
Rym: Oh, no, sorry I lied three summers ago every day that I don't upgrade my computer the computer I'm going to get with the same amount of money is like 1% faster I know.

178
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:06,021
Scott: but if by that logic you'll be sitting here in 2030 not buying a new computer.

179
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:15,590
Scott: No, it's gonna push me over the line 31 the computer will be 10 bajillion terahertz instead of 90 bajillion terahertz.

180
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:25,089
Rym: Yeah, you see we're still on this cusp here and to Write about when I'm gonna get a computer is right about when Team Fortress 2 is gonna come out and I'm gonna start playing FPS's again.

181
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:26,568
Rym: But that's all beside the point.

182
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:31,850
Rym: After rummaging around and hitting my computer on the side a bunch of times USB started working again.

183
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,094
Rym: So we're back on the road.

184
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:34,580
Rym: Oh by the road.

185
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,266
Rym: I mean the road to podcast Ville.

186
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:39,339
Scott: I Think we're already living in podcast Ville.

187
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:53,830
Scott: so things of the day Right all this week are things of the day have been openers to various television shows from that are sung in other languages besides English.

188
00:12:54,432 --> 00:13:00,290
Scott: Not and I can say foreign languages because this might be your home country that we're talking about here on Monday.

189
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:00,912
Scott: What do we do?

190
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:02,759
Scott: like you did Chinese Sailor Moon?

191
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,063
Rym: Yeah, and I did.

192
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,070
Scott: I don't remember doesn't matter.

193
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:06,550
Scott: It doesn't matter.

194
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,776
Rym: I don't think we need to do a recap.

195
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:10,270
Rym: suffice to say check out the things of the day all week.

196
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:14,102
Rym: Because of all these things out there we have been kind of picking the best.

197
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:16,349
Scott: or I did Hebrew macron one.

198
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:24,932
Scott: Yesterday you did Sonic Underground in French Mario Brothers Super Show in German.

199
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:29,410
Rym: now today we're going to prove probably something that we've been thinking about it now.

200
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:30,489
Rym: There's no way around it.

201
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:49,047
Rym: It seems that the German people for whatever their good points and bad points are the masters of taking American or Japanese shows and either faithfully recreating the openers in their native language or in Creating entirely new openers that are in many ways better than the originals.

202
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:54,503
Scott: Yes I present to you the original opener to Sailor Moon again.

203
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:56,830
Scott: Why is Sailor Moon showing up twice this week?

204
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,375
Scott: I don't know.

205
00:13:57,395 --> 00:14:00,172
Scott: I don't even like Sailor Moon Moon.

206
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:00,955
Scott: the germ.

207
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:06,070
Scott: the original opener to Sailor Moon in German is so badass.

208
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,662
Scott: It might be one of the best openers ever.

209
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,290
Rym: I mean the music is really good.

210
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,649
Rym: It's so good in the kind of techno that we like.

211
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,173
Rym: It's good song.

212
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:31,003
Rym: aside from that the opener itself like all the Sailor Moon openers is very well animated and very Stylistic and if the show were anything like that opener Sailor Moon would be a great freaking show man If Sailor Moon was like that opener, that would be holy crap.

213
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:31,485
Scott: Awesome.

214
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:32,990
Scott: I would watch every episode of that show.

215
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:40,779
Rym: See the thing is the reason I watched all of Sailor Moon was that while the show is mostly monster of the day and you Know Sailor Moon style antics.

216
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:46,810
Rym: There are a lot of scenes in the show Just not enough of them that are just like that opener.

217
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,977
Scott: Yeah, how many scenes like that?

218
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:52,387
Rym: like one every 20 episodes about one every eight or nine?

219
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:54,274
Scott: It's not that bad It's still pretty bad.

220
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:58,309
Scott: It should be the whole show and the whole show should only be 26 episodes long.

221
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:03,730
Rym: Yeah, yeah as opposed to 200, but yeah suffice to say I watched it all and it's not that bad of a show.

222
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:04,494
Rym: There are worse.

223
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:09,750
Scott: I guess if you have nothing better to do with your time Then you can watch 200 episodes of Sailor Moon.

224
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,307
Scott: But anyway things I want to point out about this opener.

225
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:22,476
Scott: number one Of course, we said already the music in this opener is so badass Holy shit, and two there's like towards the middle of the opener There's a quick like.

226
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:26,670
Scott: it's like less than a ten less than two seconds of animation.

227
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,670
Rym: It's like three beats worth of stuff.

228
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,115
Scott: Yeah of the masks.

229
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:36,759
Scott: like turning around multiplying and then like the mask guys Sort of coming up and taking up the whole screen.

230
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:41,528
Scott: like every time I see that imagery It just gives me this feeling of whoa.

231
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:44,339
Rym: Yeah It's just like a new tenor in the Black Rose saga.

232
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:50,781
Rym: whenever it cuts to the basement where all those kids died long ago And they all just in one motion look back toward you.

233
00:15:51,344 --> 00:15:52,387
Scott: Yeah, it's kind of.

234
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:53,150
Scott: it's really cool.

235
00:15:53,270 --> 00:16:00,275
Scott: And if there was an anime they gave me that same feeling that I get when I see those masks turn around Throughout the whole anime.

236
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:01,660
Scott: that'd be the best anime ever.

237
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:02,844
Rym: now see this.

238
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,410
Rym: this has happened before to us.

239
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,153
Rym: You know this thing.

240
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:12,198
Rym: the style and the mood and the vibe of this opener is So much darker and better than what Sailor Moon actually is.

241
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,465
Rym: the same thing happened with you ten a movie.

242
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:19,310
Rym: if you watch the AMVs To the you ten a movie they make that movie look amazing.

243
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:23,228
Rym: You'll watch them and think holy shit this movie is gonna be the best thing ever.

244
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,514
Scott: no It's not snake cars.

245
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:27,590
Rym: Yeah, naked cars, but you wouldn't know that from those music video.

246
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:33,450
Rym: No, cuz naked cars aren't in the music videos, so I was gonna do the one-piece opener in Italian.

247
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:36,350
Scott: Oh my god is the one-piece opener in Italian awesome?

248
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:43,067
Rym: It is so much better than the Japanese and the American openers I agree, but the right.

249
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:58,066
Rym: instead I want to do the opener to gargoyles the American cartoon in Germany now while in unlike the Sailor Moon thing which is totally different and better it is pretty much a straight-up Perfect rendition just had happens to be in German.

250
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:05,790
Rym: in fact It sounds a little bit cooler because the German language at least to my American ears sounds a little bit more dark and medieval.

251
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:08,922
Scott: Maybe because that's where the medieval stuff happened.

252
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:09,726
Scott: You know in Germany.

253
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,656
Rym: Yeah, yeah But it just.

254
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:20,980
Rym: I like gargoyles, and I like this German opener And I think this proves that the Germans are absolute badasses when it comes to Remastering or remaking the openings of shows.

255
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:27,361
Scott: maybe they try really hard at it I have no idea, but yeah the German opener to the gargoyles TV.

256
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,885
Scott: Show is tat awesome.

257
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,690
Rym: so enough awesome.

258
00:17:31,094 --> 00:17:32,609
Rym: Let's review the New York comic-con.

259
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:43,230
Scott: Alright, so New York comic-con for those of you who do not know is a comic primarily comic convention But it also includes anime and gaming in the Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

260
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:48,746
Scott: This is the the second annual one happened this past weekend.

261
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,010
Rym: That was an awkward sentence.

262
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:51,618
Rym: Yes, you see you might remember.

263
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,870
Rym: We've talked about it a bit, and we did a show on it last year.

264
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:07,610
Rym: But last year they tried to do a New York comic-con for the first time ever and it was perhaps the most poorly managed debacle of a disaster to ever have graced New York City at least in terms of anime manga comic conventions.

265
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:15,950
Scott: Yes, well basically to sum it up They decided to have a convention in New York City because there wasn't one and it felt like there should be which is correct.

266
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,793
Rym: They did it eating.

267
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:18,600
Rym: There's a reason why there aren't any.

268
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:29,461
Scott: there's a reason why there aren't any conventions in New York City At least not nerdy ones because there aren't any convention centers in New York City that are Good for having nerdy conventions in.

269
00:18:29,622 --> 00:18:31,430
Rym: yeah, we're not going to talk about what happened last time.

270
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,659
Rym: We've talked about it enough yet.

271
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,363
Rym: I want to hear about.

272
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,423
Scott: just to sum it up They had a lot more people than they could handle.

273
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:37,670
Scott: they had to turn people away.

274
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:38,636
Scott: It was unhappy.

275
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:39,481
Scott: It was crowded.

276
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:40,306
Scott: It was black.

277
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:49,109
Rym: so this year They got more space and they tried to rectify these problems and instead we got to see the actual con Which had a very different set of problems?

278
00:18:49,850 --> 00:19:02,349
Scott: Well, yeah basically, I think the number one problem with the convention this year is the timing of things and The like basic simple logistics of what went on.

279
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,230
Scott: It's like you could buy a ticket and you could get in and they stopped selling tickets for Friday.

280
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,000
Scott: So everyone who paid got in and no one showed up.

281
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:17,890
Scott: if you showed up and didn't get a ticket and get in That was your own damn fault for not visiting the website or not reading any information, you know.

282
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,715
Scott: So that problem was averted.

283
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:20,717
Scott: They solved that one.

284
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:21,720
Scott: Here's the problem.

285
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,362
Scott: They did have.

286
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:25,590
Scott: let's use our personal experience as the example.

287
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:26,457
Scott: We show up.

288
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:34,703
Scott: All right on Saturday Friday We have Friday only badges and on Friday The con is open to normal people from 4 p.m.

289
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:35,366
Scott: To 9 p.m.

290
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,000
Rym: Now now think about 4 to 9 p.m.

291
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:39,347
Rym: And it costs us what 30 bucks.

292
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:46,066
Rym: Yep, see I'm trying not to be hard on this con, but 30 bucks for 4 p.m.

293
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:53,770
Rym: To 9 p.m Where for very little much more than that I can get a whole weekend at Katsu con or Otakon.

294
00:19:54,413 --> 00:20:02,467
Scott: Yeah, the prices the badges don't really make too much sense Unless you buy the weekend pass which is sort of annoying because there's no reason as I will get to.

295
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:05,563
Scott: there's no reason to Buy a weekend pass to the newer comic sadly.

296
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,569
Rym: That was the saving grace.

297
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:14,699
Rym: Sure It was only open 4 to 9 but by 6 45 I had done everything I wanted to do with the con and I grabbed my stuff and left.

298
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:15,341
Scott: Yep.

299
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:18,470
Scott: I left soon after I think like seven something.

300
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,133
Scott: Ish I left.

301
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:20,177
Scott: I don't really remember.

302
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,070
Rym: you could literally do everything at this con in two hours.

303
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:33,367
Scott: Yeah, I mean not coming unless you if you're someone who cares about buying comics first of all This isn't the con for you because there isn't much in the way of buying comics.

304
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:43,009
Scott: and to Even if you did want to buy comics and you came there to buy them now, you know that would basically take you a half a day to look through all the comics there.

305
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:54,530
Scott: and If you wanted to go to panels and events, which I don't really you know I'm not interested in the panels and events that they were offering then maybe it would be worth it to go all three days.

306
00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:04,288
Rym: but yeah, except all the panels that are worthwhile cost extra money and sell out and are hard to get to or Happen before anyone can actually get into the car.

307
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:06,419
Scott: Yes That's what I was trying to allude to before.

308
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:07,926
Scott: the number one problem with this convention.

309
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,192
Scott: We show up We have.

310
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,370
Scott: they were smart in that we could get our badges any time during the day.

311
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,755
Rym: Yeah, we showed up at like two o'clock.

312
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:15,358
Rym: We went in.

313
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:16,161
Rym: there was no line.

314
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:16,703
Rym: No crowd.

315
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:20,025
Rym: We got our badges and alright Let's go get some food.

316
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:20,489
Rym: So we left.

317
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:26,585
Scott: Yeah, I mean we looked and there were people who were waiting to get in the doors at 4 p.m Cuz until 4 p.m.

318
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:34,514
Scott: It was like, you know exhibitors and industry only time which I think they should have moved to Thursday and had Friday been every one Day, but whatever.

319
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:37,428
Scott: and there are people waiting in line to get in the door at 4 p.m.

320
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:41,866
Scott: Maybe like a hundred people 200 at the most I counted.

321
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:47,290
Rym: there were about 180 people because I had that stupid axe clicker since we got a box of a billion of them from Katsu Kan.

322
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:55,110
Scott: yeah, and There was no point in us waiting for two hours in that line so that we could be among the first to get into a room.

323
00:21:55,672 --> 00:21:58,910
Rym: So of course because there's no food anywhere near the Javits we walked aways.

324
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,725
Scott: We walked aways to like 8th Avenue.

325
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:02,470
Scott: We got some food.

326
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:05,027
Scott: We came back at around 3. ish.

327
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,521
Scott: So we got an hour until the doors open.

328
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:15,410
Scott: when we get back at 3 There was a line going from where the line was before out into the street and we had already checked our coat.

329
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,904
Scott: So there was no way we were going outside again now, so we're smart.

330
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:20,867
Rym: now all these other people.

331
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:28,656
Rym: we watch people Trying to like game their way into the line or cut ahead of people or you know Just kind of walk in the door.

332
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:31,690
Rym: and there's this one awesome security dude standing there.

333
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:34,190
Rym: He was probably the best part of the whole con as far as I was concerned.

334
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:39,583
Rym: Maybe he's standing there and he's just yelling with high energy keeping these nerds in line.

335
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:40,305
Rym: Keep walking.

336
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:48,042
Rym: Let's talk in yelling at him Very much ridiculing anyone who actually tried to jive him and get into the line where they shouldn't.

337
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:52,785
Rym: and he was sending everyone outside and telling them they Were stupid for trying to get into the line at the middle.

338
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:55,801
Rym: Mm-hmm He was the only reason this didn't descend into chaos.

339
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,470
Rym: that single man saved the con.

340
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:05,132
Scott: Yeah I mean because he pretty much beyond him was the roped off area where you don't need so many people to manage because this roped Off area.

341
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:11,169
Scott: but you know, he was managing everyone who is not in the roped off area keeping them from being stupid.

342
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:19,879
Rym: now I gotta say the sheer number of people at this con who tried to sneak in or cut in line or get past This guy was astounding to me.

343
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:21,790
Rym: it averaged about two or three a minute.

344
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:26,062
Scott: Yeah it was kind of crazy like how many people were trying to like sneak around.

345
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:35,152
Rym: the guy was getting more and more angry as time went on as people kept coming up with sob stories or excuses or trying to like distract him and get around behind him just to cut in line, he

346
00:23:35,193 --> 00:23:47,960
Scott: was cool though because obviously this line was for people who had badges already and wanted to get in you know to the actual con and Anytime someone showed up to him without a badge yet.

347
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:52,015
Scott: He would say go up there get your badge and when you come back I'll let you in here.

348
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:52,920
Scott: At least he was cool.

349
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,930
Scott: You know, he wasn't like mean or anything.

350
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:05,119
Scott: Anyway as a result of this crazy line and there being only one entrance to the convention The convention that supposedly started at 4 p.m.

351
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,428
Scott: We couldn't get into it until past 5 p.m.

352
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:13,590
Rym: In fact, it was about 5 30 little after 5 30 that we finally got through the doors.

353
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,903
Rym: And the thing is there wasn't really wasn't any reason for it to take that long it.

354
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:20,290
Rym: the line could have been easily processed faster.

355
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,337
Rym: I don't know what they were doing.

356
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,450
Rym: Maybe they only had one guy at the front checking badges.

357
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:29,268
Scott: It was like a single file line of everyone who wanted to get into the con right away at 4 p.m.

358
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,939
Scott: Now here's why it had to be a single file line.

359
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,430
Scott: It could have been like a five file line.

360
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,970
Scott: It could have been three or four or five file lines.

361
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,970
Scott: There are multiple entrances to this place.

362
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,237
Rym: Well, here's what really bothered me.

363
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,390
Rym: after we got into the con and I got bored.

364
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:50,290
Rym: So I went to leave and I noticed after I went out and got my coat That there was no line to get in and there was almost no security or anything.

365
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:56,390
Rym: So on a whim I just walked back up without my badge visible and had no trouble getting anywhere.

366
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:57,678
Rym: I wanted to go just about.

367
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,409
Scott: yeah, it's kind of silly.

368
00:25:00,072 --> 00:25:03,750
Rym: Anyway, yeah, so we finally get in after standing in the first.

369
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,356
Scott: There's a problem with this.

370
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:16,698
Scott: the fact that the con opens at 4 right and people can't Realistically get into the convention until about 5, you know what the problem is Well, wasn't there an event that you wanted to go to it for?

371
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:18,745
Scott: there are a lot of things scheduled for 4g.

372
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:21,795
Scott: That's great.

373
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:25,067
Scott: You scheduled something for 4 when even though the con is open.

374
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:25,790
Scott: No one can get in.

375
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:32,070
Scott: I mean even conventions like, you know Otakon are not so run by fans.

376
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,062
Scott: This is a convention New York Comic Con run by the industry.

377
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,266
Scott: It is paid for.

378
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,135
Scott: there's a Company that runs the thing.

379
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:40,519
Scott: It's a company.

380
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:41,502
Scott: read exhibitions.

381
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,247
Scott: All they do is run conventions.

382
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:44,410
Scott: That is their job.

383
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,754
Scott: They run trade shows.

384
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:57,210
Scott: you think they would know better than to have events at the same time as you start letting people in Like someone's gonna come into the door at the exact moment the con starts and run to an event immediately.

385
00:25:57,774 --> 00:25:59,909
Scott: Otakon is that smart enough not to do that?

386
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:06,531
Scott: In fact every anime con I've ever been to even the really terrible ones like Ohio con 2.0.

387
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,735
Scott: I don't know how con is now But you have a con.

388
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:15,170
Scott: you don't start your programming your scheduled programming until a little bit after.

389
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,384
Scott: You know you give people time to get into the convention.

390
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:23,569
Scott: you have your main You know room open so people have something to do as soon as they get in.

391
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:30,150
Scott: But you don't start scheduled events until people have time to get into the convention center, that's just stupid.

392
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:33,531
Rym: So we finally get in and there's a big open area We can see.

393
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:40,550
Rym: it's pretty much to your left is a gigantic dealer's room and that's it a dealer slash exhibition room.

394
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,229
Rym: It's just a dealer's room.

395
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:47,310
Scott: Did you actually know if you actually look at who's in that room only about?

396
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,814
Scott: 25% of it is Dealing and selling shit.

397
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:56,730
Scott: the rest of it is all people just exhibiting shit and showing stuff off, but it wasn't anything special.

398
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,412
Rym: I mean there was no.

399
00:26:57,552 --> 00:27:02,367
Rym: there were mediocre games that were being demoed and effectively was just marketing.

400
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,374
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty That's what exhibition is.

401
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:14,085
Rym: yeah, and to your right was a little escalator that went up to the artist alley area Except there was a line to go up the escalator And they couldn't let anyone up until people came down already.

402
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,170
Rym: mind you the kind of just started.

403
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:21,650
Rym: We just gotten in the door and pretty much It was almost impossible to get up there at any time, and they weren't managing this line very well.

404
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:33,430
Rym: There was one guy and every time one person came down the escalator you let one person up and the line pretty much went Straight across the entrance to the con preventing anyone trying to get in from getting anywhere else without shoving through them.

405
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:39,110
Rym: Yeah, yeah They should have just turned the and no one even said no one even said what the line was.

406
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:48,668
Rym: so there was just this crowd of people and then this other crowd of people standing around this crowd of people trying to figure Out what this first crowd of people is for and he after the guard he pretty much just said I don't know.

407
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:56,261
Scott: Yeah, basically when I went up to the escalator when I was done in the X main exhibition hall I wanted to go upstairs to the artist alley the guy.

408
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:59,654
Scott: you would just stop everyone from going up the escalator Unless you had us.

409
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:02,469
Scott: unless you were a special person then he would just let you up then.

410
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,944
Scott: You know people are basically constantly coming down the escalators.

411
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,470
Scott: many people has wanted to come down.

412
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,218
Scott: They didn't care and then every like minute.

413
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,190
Scott: He would let like 10 people up the escalator, then he would stop everyone.

414
00:28:14,351 --> 00:28:15,736
Scott: Yeah, I would let 10 people.

415
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:23,726
Rym: I went over here earlier than Scott while he was still looking around the dealer area And when I finally got up there, I couldn't actually go into the artist alley.

416
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:32,039
Rym: It was so full of people I literally would have had to push people out of my way or stand there and shuffle at a rate slower than an old person Buying fruit at a convenience store.

417
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:46,370
Scott: Yeah, the artists alley was Ludicrously crowded and the out the aisles in the artists alley were very narrow Narrower than they should have been and the actual booths at the artists alley were kind of small and close together.

418
00:28:46,851 --> 00:29:00,017
Scott: So like if there was a popular guy at a booth next to you and like three people were waiting to talk to him they would basically cover the front of your booth and then make it harder for people to walk in the aisle and Etc etc.

419
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:00,480
Scott: etc.

420
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:01,650
Scott: if they have it.

421
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:14,310
Scott: I think the problem was and this is actually one good thing about the New York comic convention Usually when you go to a comic convention, right the the semi famous people or the famous people are guests of the convention.

422
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,569
Scott: You know, they have panels, you know, they wheel them out for autographs and stuff like that.

423
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,941
Scott: But they don't usually have artists alley tables.

424
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:25,479
Scott: artists alley tables are for you know The small-time people who they're not guests of the convention.

425
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:26,984
Scott: they pay to get in there and whatever.

426
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:29,512
Scott: at the New York comic convention There were

427
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:30,154
Rym: lots of

428
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:48,250
Scott: famous creators who would have been guests of honor at most mid to small sized comic conventions and Since the New York Comic Con was so big and so up there these people were just in artists alley Which was awesome except for the fact that artists alley was tiny.

429
00:29:48,712 --> 00:29:53,112
Scott: Thus it created a bigger problem when you have a famous guy just sitting there going hi How you doing?

430
00:29:53,614 --> 00:29:57,028
Scott: And now people are lining up and crowding around in a cramped artists alley.

431
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:06,040
Rym: granted I'll admit since I don't really read many comics I didn't know who any of those people were so I had really no reason to be up there and I I wanted to just But I couldn't really know.

432
00:30:06,081 --> 00:30:07,470
Scott: browsing is pretty much impossible.

433
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,910
Rym: The only thing I could have done there was look for names of people, but I don't recognize any of these people.

434
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,508
Rym: So I just gave up after about 10 minutes of trying to squeeze in.

435
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:21,916
Scott: Yeah I basically walked up and down the artists alley looking at the people's names above the booths and then looking down to see if they Were actually there.

436
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:24,754
Scott: if I recognize the name, let's see What else is going on.

437
00:30:24,835 --> 00:30:27,610
Scott: at the end of the artists alley was the podcast arena?

438
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:34,679
Scott: I think which is where all the comic podcasts were hanging out and You know, they had a lot of room over there.

439
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,830
Scott: they were having a good old time and whoo-hoo awesome for them.

440
00:30:37,891 --> 00:30:38,569
Scott: I went over there.

441
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,266
Scott: I talked to a bunch of people and it was awesome fun going down that away.

442
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:47,090
Scott: if you're interested in Podcasts if you didn't know those people if you didn't you weren't interested in podcast.

443
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,134
Scott: You're privately just like.

444
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:49,760
Scott: what the fuck is this shit Charles?

445
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:50,924
Scott: Who are these people?

446
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:52,550
Scott: Why are they in between?

447
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:56,169
Scott: You know the gaming room and the artists alley, huh?

448
00:30:56,832 --> 00:31:01,247
Scott: You know, whatever it was cool to have a podcast arena that was sort of like.

449
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:06,870
Scott: noted It shows that the con is respecting podcasts in some way, but I don't know.

450
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:14,910
Scott: It didn't really seem to do anything except provide the podcasters with a fun place to hang out for them And a place for their listeners to meet up and hang out.

451
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:21,464
Rym: I imagine the only reason they have podcasting there at all is Simply because they expect these people to cover the con and those provide more press.

452
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:27,766
Scott: perhaps perhaps I mean, it really does seem like the New York Comic Con is incredibly podcast friendly.

453
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:28,950
Scott: I mean they have their own podcast.

454
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:31,979
Scott: They're podcasting all their panels over time.

455
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:41,048
Scott: the guy who runs the con goes on podcasts and talks to people You know, so I guess they're really trying to harness the power of podcasting in some way.

456
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:51,390
Scott: great Yeah, and beyond there was the gaming room, which I didn't go in But it was basically a bunch of CCG is being played and stuff like that And that was also where the autographs were being done.

457
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,129
Scott: But I didn't even know that because there was no way to know that.

458
00:31:55,632 --> 00:32:07,269
Scott: I actually heard stories from other people that they wanted to go to someone's autograph session, you know Cuz I don't really care about autographs and they couldn't find it because it was hidden in the side of the game room and there Wasn't much signage to tell you that it was going on.

459
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:12,850
Rym: So pretty much the only other thing we did was wander around the giant dealers room and not even all of it.

460
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,969
Rym: I mean half of it was just people selling comics.

461
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:19,309
Scott: yeah, the back like left-hand corner was just people selling comics.

462
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:24,374
Scott: and You know, I guess if you want to buy comics Good for you.

463
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:27,206
Scott: But if you're in New York City, why don't you to go to a convention for that?

464
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:33,196
Scott: There's like four Tremendous awesome comic book stores that you can go to though at least a better deal in this area.

465
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:44,607
Rym: konami had a big setup and they were pushing you all the new DDR mixes and They gave us a bunch of free CDs of the music from all their new mixes Which of course we actually kind of threw him for a loop.

466
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:49,494
Rym: when you know They give them to us and we said something like oh, yeah We had these Akatsukan.

467
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:53,750
Rym: we were giving them away and they were taken aback by this like what how'd you get him?

468
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,555
Rym: And then we just left.

469
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:55,461
Scott: Yeah.

470
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:59,034
Scott: Yeah, so I Guess one of them.

471
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:01,063
Scott: it was an EBE giveaway, I guess right?

472
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:02,550
Scott: Yeah, we only had one of them.

473
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,939
Scott: They gave us three or four that we didn't have already.

474
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,550
Scott: Oh, well, what else was in that main dealers room?

475
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,773
Scott: That was good to look at.

476
00:33:08,994 --> 00:33:13,710
Rym: Well CPM was selling stuff, you know CPM the company that's pretty much going out of business.

477
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:16,364
Rym: Yep, if they're not well, they're effectively out of business.

478
00:33:16,384 --> 00:33:17,510
Rym: They're just selling off their stock.

479
00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:19,065
Rym: So we talked to them for a while.

480
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:19,530
Rym: They were cool.

481
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,972
Rym: They had.

482
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:36,298
Rym: it wasn't just you know, like the usual five dollar DVDs or whatever's deal I bought a pile of really bad anime for almost no money including a silent service and Grappler Baki, we're not watching that shit.

483
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,806
Rym: No, however, the guys were really cool.

484
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:50,585
Rym: We talked to him for a while and When they you know rang up my order and they gave me my little baggie with my DVDs in it He grabbed a fistful of other Stuff and shoved it in the bag and said here you go now.

485
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:51,690
Rym: little did I know at the time?

486
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:53,088
Rym: But he was actually trying to kill me.

487
00:33:53,613 --> 00:34:07,330
Rym: You see when I got on the train to go home I looked in the bag and among the things that he had shoved in there without my asking or paying for Was the soundtrack the OST to the second worst anime ever MD Geist?

488
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,260
Rym: OMG, so thus I'm going to have a little contest.

489
00:34:11,761 --> 00:34:21,250
Rym: I want you out there to write or Say or in any somehow expressed to us not only what was the worst anime you've ever seen.

490
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,779

491
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,730
Rym: What is the worst anime you have ever seen?

492
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,455
Rym: But it's not just that easy.

493
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:30,002

Rym: final program quotation mark.

502
00:34:55,822 --> 00:34:57,990
Rym: D quotation mark is pretty cool.

503
00:34:58,272 --> 00:34:59,709
Scott: You mean what's that called?

504
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:02,295
Scott: Death force death force.

505
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:02,797
Scott: That's right.

506
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:05,266
Rym: And of course the the snazzy football uniform.

507
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:08,040
Scott: Oh All right, let's see.

508
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,764
Scott: what else did we see?

509
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:09,750
Scott: that was cool in the dealers room?

510
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:16,690
Scott: Oh, there was a. there was like a sci-fi DVD purse selling person, but they had a lot of cheap anime DVDs.

511
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,763
Scott: We got all of ko beast for $25.

512
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:20,045
Rym: Yep.

513
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,250
Rym: I'm very pleased with that.

514
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:28,328
Rym: We're gonna be reviewing ko century bees probably next Wednesday, maybe What else is cool in there?

515
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,271
Scott: There were.

516
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:35,589
Scott: basically there was a different, you know, every major comic publisher had some sort of booth or display there.

517
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:39,562
Scott: You know, I stopped off at all the ones that I know and I chatted him up.

518
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:42,270
Scott: ATV was there selling their Chevalier DVDs.

519
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:48,707
Scott: There are quite a few people selling the same manga that I saw Katsucon at the same prices.

520
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:49,630
Scott: I saw at Katsucon.

521
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:56,984
Rym: Granted the anime industry seems to be slowly recouping from the bad years They've had recently since they were here at least the ones that were here.

522
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:58,329
Rym: We're here in full force.

523
00:35:58,971 --> 00:36:11,632
Scott: Yeah, they basically I mean Viz had like I think right up front like they had a little like a little house and Like they gave they were giving away their canvas bags and their free sneak peek Mangas.

524
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:12,736
Scott: Viz was out like.

525
00:36:12,856 --> 00:36:17,110
Scott: that's the biggest convention setup Viz has and Viz didn't even go to Otakon this year.

526
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,819
Scott: So that was pretty cool to see them there.

527
00:36:19,463 --> 00:36:20,650
Scott: Who else was cool?

528
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:36,500
Scott: the DC booth was basically just like this rotation of comic creators doing signings and whatnot and it was actually kind of funny because it was really small and cramped and You had to like kind of look around to see who was sitting where.

529
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:45,778
Scott: they had like four separate desks of different heights and positions And if you were the last person in line to talk to a creator They would give you the sign to hold.

530
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:47,928
Scott: that said I am the last person in this line.

531
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:51,448
Scott: Haha Wow, I saw some nerd holding the sign and I laughed at him.

532
00:36:52,551 --> 00:37:05,921
Rym: Yeah, we did see while we were waiting to try to get into the con Stan Lee walked by with his entourage and if he Hadn't been as far away as he was I would have totally run up before the guard shot me and asked him why the hell He bolded all those random words.

533
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:06,727
Scott: Yeah.

534
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:13,824
Scott: Yeah I mean we probably could have run up and like been like, excuse me We can get an entourage of like 30 people or I was in like 30.

535
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:15,390
Rym: It was at least 18 people.

536
00:37:15,772 --> 00:37:16,816
Rym: There were a lot of people.

537
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:17,901
Scott: it was like five feet.

538
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,266
Rym: Oh, it was far more than that.

539
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:20,110
Scott: That's not what I saw.

540
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,014
Rym: That's what I saw.

541
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:22,662
Scott: I think you're there were.

542
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:30,110
Rym: no there were in all seriousness At least 15 people following him and like this teardrop shaped trail, that's not what I saw anyway.

543
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:37,310
Scott: Yeah, Oh one cool thing about this actually was down the right side of the exhibition hall.

544
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:39,658
Scott: it was actually sort of poorly laid out.

545
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:46,049
Scott: these people all had their backs to the wall and there was like a pillar in the Way and there wasn't a lot of room in front of them.

546
00:37:46,631 --> 00:38:05,770
Scott: But down the right side of the exhibition hall in the last aisle were tiny booths for all like the ridiculously independent small-time publishers like vertical was over there and Like all the people usually see an artist alley at mid-sized conventions and that I saw a lot of cool stuff down that way.

547
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:08,683
Scott: I just didn't want to buy any of it, but it was pretty cool.

548
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:11,115
Scott: talking to a lot of those people like hey What do you make here?

549
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:12,522
Scott: Whoa, I never heard of that.

550
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:13,749
Scott: Ooh, that looks pretty cool.

551
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:15,474
Rym: Yeah, other than that.

552
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:17,561
Rym: I mean we ran into the guy who does dr.

553
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:19,146
Rym: McGninja who is totally awesome.

554
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:19,467
Rym: Yep.

555
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:19,748
Scott: Dr.

556
00:38:19,788 --> 00:38:21,175
Scott: McGninja guys Awesome.

557
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:23,690
Rym: Scott ran into Jim Vowles the former con chair of Otakon.

558
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:26,790
Rym: I had already given up on the con and was getting my coat at that point.

559
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:32,509
Scott: But yeah, basically, I think the final word in the New York Comic Con is that is a big room.

560
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:36,070
Scott: It's full of some awesome stuff and some not-so-awesome stuff.

561
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,623
Scott: If you know comics the artist alley is really awesome.

562
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:42,830
Scott: if you can get around the crowdedness of it.

563
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,427
Rym: Well, if you know comics and you care about the semi-famous people who do them.

564
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,976
Scott: Yep I don't know.

565
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:57,210
Scott: if you want to get autographs and sketches There's pretty much no better place because whoever you want to get them from is almost guaranteed to be there.

566
00:38:57,632 --> 00:39:01,450
Rym: But other than that, I mean don't because there I saw a lot of anime fans.

567
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:14,213
Rym: I walked around just kind of asking people about the con since I really didn't have much to do at it And there were a lot of anime fans or people who like were at katsu kana went to anime cons at this con and without Exception.

568
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:17,423
Rym: they were all very much disappointed and bored and said they'd never come back.

569
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:27,809
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty much Even though this is like the biggest baddest comic-con in the East Coast I mean pretty much only San Diego comic-con beats out this one.

570
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:35,690
Scott: It's not run any differently from any other comic cons except that it's bigger really big too big for its own shoes.

571
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,690
Rym: I mean really if you like the stuff they've got you can do all that stuff.

572
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,010
Rym: But even beyond that there's really no way to hang out.

573
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,850
Rym: There's no where you can just sit and hang out with other comic fans easily.

574
00:39:45,352 --> 00:39:52,530
Rym: it's just crowded and hard to get around and expensive and difficult to get to and I was thoroughly unimpressed.

575
00:39:53,652 --> 00:40:02,553
Scott: Yeah, I mean if you like comics I'd say it's worth it to go for one day if you're a comic fan like Friday or Sunday not Saturday It's not.

576
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:08,481
Scott: it's not worth it to go to this thing on Saturday ever unless There's some crazy event that you must go to.

577
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:10,930
Scott: but none of the events really interested me.

578
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,598
Scott: you can go to the website and look and see what the events were.

579
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:27,098
Scott: all of the cool events like see Stephen Colbert or see Stephen King or Watch the new sci-fi TV episodes before they're on TV.

580
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,170
Scott: you need separate tickets for all that shit and They don't really tell you where to get those separate tickets or how much they cost.

581
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:39,763
Rym: Actually when I was going around asking people about the con They they must have assumed I was press or something.

582
00:40:39,783 --> 00:40:41,170
Rym: cuz you know, I'm asking him stuff.

583
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:46,004
Rym: So they're always at the end like hey So, you know where I can get tickets to whatever and I had no way to tell him.

584
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:46,586
Rym: I didn't know.

585
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:50,316
Scott: yeah I mean That's one thing that I really like about.

586
00:40:50,396 --> 00:40:54,086
Scott: pretty much every anime convention is a badge to the con.

587
00:40:54,507 --> 00:40:55,830
Scott: is a badge to the con.

588
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,175
Scott: You have a badge.

589
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:01,470
Scott: you can do anything as long as your badge is for the right day.

590
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:04,413
Scott: You know if you buy a Friday badge You can do anything.

591
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:08,990
Scott: that happens on Friday at this con and I think a lot of other comic cons.

592
00:41:09,572 --> 00:41:12,843
Scott: Alright a Friday badge gets you in the door on Friday.

593
00:41:13,465 --> 00:41:14,990
Scott: Oh you want to do that ten bucks.

594
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:19,728
Scott: Oh you want to do that ten bucks and a lot of the stuff happens at the same time.

595
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:29,148
Scott: or You don't know where to get the tickets or only special people can get the tickets and alright You know while that's not nice and I don't like it I guess it's fair.

596
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:37,778
Scott: But what I don't think is fair is that when they promote this con to you they say hey come to the New York Comic Con Stephen King will be here.

597
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:43,061
Scott: or hey come to the New York Comic Con Wes Craven and Stan Lee will be here and you that's.

598
00:41:43,402 --> 00:41:43,643
Scott: it's like.

599
00:41:43,663 --> 00:41:45,530
Scott: that's a selling point to come to the con.

600
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:48,119
Scott: But coming to the con doesn't actually get you.

601
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:57,490
Scott: that it's like if I said hey buy this game It has this awesome car in this racing game, but then you buy the get racing game and the car isn't in there.

602
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,950
Scott: Oh you actually have to buy this other thing to have that car.

603
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:04,481
Scott: You know it's sort of like a disingenuous sell when they do that And I don't like it.

604
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:11,506
Rym: plus It's just more that the greater problem with cons like this is that Con you no matter how great a con is the content will only take you.

605
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:12,853
Rym: so far You're not.

606
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:19,600
Rym: not many people who go to these geek cons really seem to want to go to Nothing, but panels and events.

607
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:21,990
Rym: they want to spend some time hanging out with other geeks.

608
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,517
Rym: But you really can't do anything like this.

609
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,550
Rym: Yeah, there was then again at a comic-con.

610
00:42:26,952 --> 00:42:33,002
Rym: I mean you all remember when I covered Philly Wizard World last year It was very difficult to strike up a conversation with anyone.

611
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:36,738
Rym: people tended to shy away if I said hello That was without a microphone.

612
00:42:36,758 --> 00:42:39,370
Rym: I might add not II I didn't even have any of my stuff out.

613
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,582
Rym: I was just some guy saying hi trying to talk about spider-man.

614
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:43,084
Scott: Yep.

615
00:42:43,164 --> 00:43:01,650
Scott: I mean the primary reason I Decided to go as opposed to not go is because there were a lot of people at this convention that I knew Either from the Internet's or from real life or from whatever that I wanted to go and say hi to Hell, there were people there that I knew that I need even know we're gonna be there like the ninja consultants were there.

616
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,030
Scott: I'd even run into them, but they were there and I didn't know until afterwards and they did a show on it.

617
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:12,841
Scott: You know if I had saw if I had seen them there I would have stopped to chat and say hi You know and that's I think that's the number one thing that he were.

618
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,085
Scott: comic-con is going for.

619
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:15,630
Scott: is that a bunch of people?

620
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,428
Scott: I know were there.

621
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:29,550
Scott: But even when I ran into people I knew and started to talk to them like Jim Vowles or whatever we had to stand in the aisle and talk blocking the way and We couldn't talk for that long because you know, it wasn't really like a hangout.

622
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:35,690
Scott: It was just stopping and saying hi in the middle of a hallway in a busy busy convention room.

623
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:41,350
Scott: It's not like in an anime con where there's even an anime con if all you do is events and stuff.

624
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:55,970
Scott: there are lots and lots of events where you can go to the event and talk to people and And this like it's sort of like a social event or play events where you can, you know Even at a panel at an anime con there's a lot more interaction with the panelists themselves.

625
00:43:56,131 --> 00:44:04,670
Scott: It's it's less of a top-down sort of thing when you go to a panel at a comic-con It's super famous guy up on the day as you sit there and be quiet and listen to what they say.

626
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,081
Scott: Maybe you can ask a question at the end.

627
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:07,503
Scott: That's it.

628
00:44:08,005 --> 00:44:11,810
Rym: It's it's I don't know I just I really can't jive with cons like this.

629
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:12,915
Rym: I'm a social creature.

630
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:20,110
Rym: if I go to a con is mostly because I want to meet and hang out with people and Even if I wanted to do events there was really no event at this con.

631
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:27,898
Rym: Maybe just cuz I'm not much of a comic fan that interested me at all and I must say Part of the reason I went was that way back.

632
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:29,705
Rym: I used to complain like yeah comic cons.

633
00:44:29,806 --> 00:44:30,850
Rym: I definitely don't like them.

634
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:37,536
Rym: They're kind of a they're not my bag and a lot of people out there are listeners and Scott said hey You can't knock it till you tried it.

635
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:40,630
Rym: Well, I went to Philly Wizard World and I went to the New York Comic Con.

636
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:45,690
Rym: I hated both of them and regretted going to them and I probably will never go to a comic-con again.

637
00:44:46,173 --> 00:44:57,990
Scott: Yeah, I mean if I go back to the New York Comic Con It'll it'll have to be because like I don't know in order to get me to go back There would have to be some like awesome shit going down for me to buy the one day.

638
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,994
Rym: It would have to go beyond.

639
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:01,504
Rym: I mean we could get a table in the podcaster alley.

640
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:02,970
Rym: That wouldn't be difficult to do at all.

641
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,152
Scott: Yeah, if I got it if we had a title in the podcast alley I might sit.

642
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:16,447
Rym: see you know, what I'm saying is even if we were given one totally free unsolicited I still wouldn't go really because that means I have to for three days in a row.

643
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:28,905
Rym: Friday Saturday Sunday Take the train down to the city Walk my ass over to the Javits and sit there in a loud room not playing music not DJing not doing fun stuff just sitting there talking to people.

644
00:45:29,608 --> 00:45:30,010
Scott: Oh, I don't know.

645
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,965
Scott: I might go if he had a podcast alley table, but that's all you.

646
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:33,588
Rym: you can run it.

647
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:36,519
Rym: Other than that you're gonna take the train every day.

648
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:38,124
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

649
00:45:38,164 --> 00:45:40,555
Scott: I'm thinking about it's not just a train It's a tough car.

650
00:45:40,595 --> 00:45:53,750
Scott: It's the train and then walking over to is I can get the table right and I could go on Friday and If I'm not having a good time hanging out with people in the podcast arena on Friday, I could just stop coming.

651
00:45:53,871 --> 00:45:54,959
Scott: I just won't show up Saturday.

652
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:56,490
Rym: You can't really do that.

653
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:56,972
Scott: Why not?

654
00:45:57,314 --> 00:45:58,680
Rym: if you're gave I mean a kind like that.

655
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:04,281
Rym: if you've got one of those precious table spots It's really not cool to just not be there.

656
00:46:04,401 --> 00:46:05,525
Scott: I can give it to someone else.

657
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:06,990
Rym: Oh, how are you gonna give it to some?

658
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:08,314
Scott: Artists I know or something.

659
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:12,467
Rym: Yeah, so now there's an artist sitting next to me who already has a table.

660
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:16,660
Scott: Yeah Oh even so that it it's I cannot.

661
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,586
Rym: yeah, I cannot think of a situation.

662
00:46:18,646 --> 00:46:19,870
Rym: Well, then again, it's not just that.

663
00:46:19,991 --> 00:46:27,330
Rym: I can't think of a situation where I would ever go To a fan convention in the Javits Center in New York City ever again, let alone a comic convention.

664
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:32,828
Scott: Yeah, I mean they're gonna have that anime festival in the Javits Center like what later this year.

665
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:34,819
Rym: next year I predict that's not going to go.

666
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,670
Scott: Well, I also predict it's not gonna go.

667
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:41,189
Scott: Well, but I somehow feel like I have to go to it to see what's gonna go.

668
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:41,649
Scott: You know what?

669
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:48,279
Rym: You said that last year about the New York Comic Con and I wisely stayed home and did whatever I did and I'm a better Man for it.

670
00:46:48,765 --> 00:47:00,920
Scott: Yeah I guess now that I'm gonna be working in the city again It'll be I guess less painful because I won't have to pay for the ticket because I've already paid to go to the city Every day of the month, so it's all you.

671
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,570
Rym: I can't think of anything that would drag me back to a comic-con.

672
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:11,376
Scott: Yeah, it's a tough call because you're basically paying for anyone who buys a weekend pass.

673
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:24,650
Scott: you better be one hell of a comic fan who's gonna go around to every artist and spend time looking at everything in every booth and go to all the autograph sessions and Figure out how to get the secret tickets to the secret special event.

674
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,350
Rym: Yes, you'd better know the names all the people who draw your comics.

675
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,013
Rym: You're not gonna.

676
00:47:28,214 --> 00:47:31,831
Scott: if you're not someone who like is fans of comic creators Like.

677
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:37,610
Scott: if you're not that nerdy there is really nothing at this con for you because you're basically gonna.

678
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:38,373
Scott: He.

679
00:47:38,574 --> 00:47:47,776
Scott: there's gonna be a bunch of people who are somewhat famous, but you don't know their names You don't know who they are and that's like 90% of the cons Entertainment value right there.

680
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:53,539
Rym: So once again more important than all that Tell me about the worst anime you've ever seen.

681
00:47:53,961 --> 00:47:59,669
Rym: whoever tells me about it the best gets the original soundtrack to the hit anime video.

682
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:05,128
Scott: MD guys and the New York Comic Con is a comic-con only big.
