1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,977
Rym: It's Monday January 7th.

2
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:12,900
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:16,090
Rym: I'm Scott and this is GeekNights tonight.

4
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,809
Rym: Love sex and robots.

5
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:26,796
Rym: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:34,060
Scott: You think in New York City that the you know big one of the most important cities in the world if not the most important.

7
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:36,220
Scott: You could get a decent internet connection.

8
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:44,360
Rym: But no Well, uh, I would wager that while New York City is one of the most important cities in the world Your company is not one of the most important companies in the way.

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,460
Scott: So it's nothing to do with our company has to do with the building.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,940
Scott: You see you when you're in New York City, you don't own a building.

11
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:55,660
Scott: I mean if you do own a building then your company is a company that owns buildings and doesn't do anything else, right?

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,380
Rym: You know, I can't really make fun of this too much because I've actually been having similar issues at my company.

13
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,195
Rym: Yeah, it's like we're sitting around.

14
00:01:02,216 --> 00:01:06,934
Rym: we're like, alright How can we get better wires into our business?

15
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:09,627
Rym: and the answer was well How much you're willing to pay?

16
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:13,142
Rym: and the answer to that was anything Anything.

17
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:16,417
Rym: we just want it to be better and there's no way.

18
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:19,249
Scott: nope Cuz you're at the mercy of the building.

19
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,940
Rym: so and it's not that you can't get it technologically.

20
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:27,693
Rym: It's that the people who run the buildings in New York City You just don't know jack all about technology and not only are we at the mercy of the building.

21
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,880
Scott: We're also at the mercy of Verizon.

22
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:31,922
Scott: In

23
00:01:33,647 --> 00:01:42,104
Rym: In all my life I've discovered that Verizon is the least shitty of the people you have to call if you've got like a t1 down or something

24
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:56,735
Scott: and that's why they can afford to sell t1s and but also lease out their copper to other people to sell t1s on because you can buy a t1 from someone else who leases Verizon's copper and then sells it to you at a lower price and you save money that way.

25
00:01:57,357 --> 00:01:58,921
Scott: or you can buy a t1 from Verizon.

26
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:05,080
Scott: but you know what if you pay for a t1 from the people actually own the copper things are usually better for you.

27
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:07,477
Scott: It's a racket It works out.

28
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:15,364
Scott: But anyway We have some like Ethernet loops to this company down the road and it went out once and it went out twice and now it Went out again.

29
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:15,867
Rym: Wait a minute.

30
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:16,329
Rym: Wait a minute.

31
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:21,634
Rym: I think you've done this opening bit before Maybe talking about your internet being down at work.

32
00:02:21,695 --> 00:02:22,540
Rym: now you couldn't do anything.

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,579
Scott: But anyway, there's like there's one of those companies that lets you aim a dish at their you know To do the might the direct link thing.

34
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:30,611
Scott: Yeah But the the building won't.

35
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:35,640
Scott: let us put a dish on the roof Even though we already have a direct TV dish up there because the building doesn't allow cable.

36
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:37,106
Scott: There's no cable in the building.

37
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:40,780
Rym: tell them it's another direct TV dish and paint it to look like one.

38
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:46,225
Scott: Yeah, but they're also doing like construction up this they don't want anyway But also it just.

39
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:55,000
Scott: they're just being a huge pain in the ass and there's nobody that we can get fast internet from in that Building even though this shit tons of bandwidth all around.

40
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:58,600
Scott: We can't get it in that building because I tell you what if we ever?

41
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:07,629
Rym: That's the one thing if we like, you know Go pro with this or whatever and we end up just having some sort of computer shop here in Beacon We can get some pretty damn fast internet.

42
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:10,540
Rym: It'll probably be pretty damn awesome fucking fiber or something.

43
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,680
Scott: There's.

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,366
Scott: no can't get any fiber or anything.

45
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:13,449
Scott: It's horrendous man.

46
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,060
Rym: Still bothers me that the FiOS is like right there down the road.

47
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:32,480
Rym: Yep, like I can walk to where the FiOS I'd get it in a second But in other news because I feel like we've talked about this before when your company's internet goes down Scott and I once again ran afoul of a fat and dignit lady.

48
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:38,140
Scott: You're talking about me talking about an opening bit that we've done before and now you're talking about a fat and dignit lady.

49
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:39,550
Rym: That might have been intentional.

50
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:45,032
Rym: I don't know maybe But seriously, it was like we're up the road pretty much.

51
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:47,140
Rym: I think this is the last time we're gonna go up the road.

52
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:48,828
Scott: You know a long time at least.

53
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:51,320
Rym: we always say up the road and basically live in Beacon.

54
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:57,760
Rym: Everything we need is in Beacon or on the internet, but there's residual things that except for groceries which are in Vishal.

55
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:03,180
Rym: Yeah, well they exist in Beacon, but I would not consider that to be a grocery store more.

56
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:06,771
Scott: I don't consider anything nearby to be a grocery store.

57
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:09,620
Rym: Well, something could be nearby and be a grocery store.

58
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,137
Rym: However, what is nearby is not a grocery store and smells.

59
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:22,532
Rym: Yes So, uh, I I mean the last time I drove to the mall was I tried to get some glasses during a blizzard and I discovered that Who doesn't go out during the blizzard?

60
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,060
Scott: opticians opticians?

61
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,437
Rym: So I show up and there's the doctor like yeah, you can buy glasses, but you can't get a checkup.

62
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:30,260
Rym: There's no doctors.

63
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:33,753
Rym: So I paid four times more to just deal with it in the city.

64
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,858
Rym: But then again, I didn't pay anything.

65
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:45,913
Rym: I didn't care Yeah, but uh, so we went up that road pretty much for the last time and we went beyond the mall All the way up the road to the gaming store which had nothing.

66
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:46,797
Rym: yeah, we went in.

67
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:49,448
Rym: we're like, oh wow Yeah, this place hasn't changed much.

68
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,480
Scott: Wow, actually it changed a lot, but they didn't have anything for us.

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,254
Rym: Remember we used to come here every month and play games with those guys.

70
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:56,440
Rym: What if they're still alive?

71
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,184
Scott: No, they're probably still alive.

72
00:04:58,225 --> 00:05:00,452
Scott: But I think they're game organized.

73
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:01,355
Scott: gaming days are over.

74
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:02,900
Rym: Yeah kind of sad.

75
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,386
Scott: Well, probably see them at that gaming for hope.

76
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:12,214
Rym: maybe yeah, but we know we pretty much did everything we could do up the road Craft store to buy stuff to build a clock decided it was worth it.

77
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,280
Rym: Yeah, we got there and we're like, where's the clock shit?

78
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,845
Rym: Where's the clock shit?

79
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:20,116
Rym: We found the clock stuff like alright All we have to do is buy the mechanisms and we can make our custom fuck it.

80
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:20,959
Rym: and then we left.

81
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,970
Scott: Yeah, those are not the kind of mechanisms I was looking for.

82
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:28,808
Rym: Yeah, so, uh, we're in this parking lot And you know, I'm gonna leave and go back home.

83
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:30,597
Rym: I got I didn't buy a ski jacket.

84
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,302
Rym: and Thank you internet, you know I go to EMS.

Rym: I haven't owned a winter hat years.

91
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:41,816
Scott: Are you ears cold?

Scott: No, why not?

93
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,559
Rym: Cuz I don't know they just don't get cold.

94
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:46,745
Rym: So, uh, all right.

Rym: I decide not to buy it.

101
00:05:57,956 --> 00:05:58,880
Rym: I look online.

102
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,271
Rym: I can buy that exact same ski jacket for 200 bucks on the internet.

103
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:03,013
Scott: Go.

104
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:03,214

Scott: Thank you internet retail stores Not so useful anymore granted.

106
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,572
Rym: The worst thing is I'm there right now.

107
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,194
Rym: I'm playing.

108
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:10,840
Rym: I was gonna go skiing this coming weekend.

109
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,885
Rym: I was all set to go skiing.

110
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,596
Rym: I haven't skied in like slow warm to go ski.

111
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,585
Rym: Well, you see yeah That's this thing now.

112
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:18,334
Rym: It's like 70 degrees.

113
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:25,857
Rym: So uh Skiing might not happen fund but on the way out in the parking lot narrow parking lot I was parked in a parking space.

114
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:32,350
Rym: We get in the car and there's this fat woman sitting in the car next to us Suv by the way, and she's.

115
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:34,059
Rym: she keeps like talking at us.

116
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,496
Scott: Well, she talked at me and she was like blabbity blabbity blah and I was just like what.

117
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:40,710
Scott: and she's like I had to crawl in through the passenger seat.

118
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:51,106
Scott: cuz you know, I couldn't get in this way and What I should have said was well, maybe if you weren't fat and driving an SUV would never problem I can get in this car just fine.

119
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:53,073
Rym: But instead Scott gets in the car.

120
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:56,129
Scott: He said I'm just like talk to him I'm not driving and he gets to.

121
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,860
Rym: the car is like that lady wants you and like what?

122
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,612
Rym: so I like open my door and I stand up and I look to the right and I'm like Hello, and she's like you parked too close to me.

123
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,937
Rym: I couldn't get into my car.

124
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:06,820
Rym: There wasn't enough space.

125
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:08,019
Rym: I had to get in from the other side.

126
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:16,272
Rym: So I look at her for a second and I'm about to just like drive away cuz I don't care and she says it again Basically, so I stopped and I look now.

127
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,780
Scott: keep in mind this parking lot.

128
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,860
Scott: The spots were really close together like this parking lot was obviously old and not designed for large video.

129
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:26,319
Scott: No, these were tiny parking space very tiny and close together parking spaces.

130
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:31,042
Rym: So what I do is I just said alright and I look on both sides of my car and I walk around my car And I go, huh?

131
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:38,799
Rym: I turned to her and I say well, I'm parked fully within the lines I'm no closer to your car than I am to the car on the other side of me.

132
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:41,089
Rym: so it's obviously not my problem.

133
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:47,292
Rym: and I go to get back in the car and I can see her getting angry and her face starts turning.

134
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:49,280
Scott: I think she was angry before we even showed up.

135
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,940
Rym: I think she was waiting for us to come back to try to yell at us.

136
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,340
Rym: She was definitely waiting for us to come and she must've been waiting a while though cuz we had lunch and we wandered around.

137
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:58,867
Rym: But so we're sitting there.

138
00:07:58,887 --> 00:07:59,691
Scott: We had lunch after that.

139
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:00,454
Rym: Oh, we don't.

140
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:00,957
Rym: Yeah, we did.

141
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:02,726
Rym: Mm-hmm I weren't in there that long.

142
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:03,974
Rym: then we just failed to buy clocks.

143
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:07,206
Scott: Yep, and We succeeded in getting paper.

144
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:08,309
Rym: Yeah, which we kind of needed.

145
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,091
Scott: We really needed.

146
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,320
Rym: so alright, so I just ignore her at this point.

147
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,672
Rym: I go to get back in the car and she says well blah blah blah blah.

148
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,700
Rym: people could be polite blah blah blah blah.

149
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:19,265
Rym: I hope that someone does this to you.

150
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:20,730
Rym: so blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

151
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:22,697
Rym: and she's getting louder and louder.

152
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:29,700
Rym: as I'm Slowly like getting in the car ignoring her and closing the door and I could see her still talking as I was driving away.

153
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:33,510
Rym: That woman was the third most indignant person.

154
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,554
Rym: I have ever personally dealt with.

155
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,600
Scott: I've dealt with a lot more indignant.

156
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:39,793
Scott: Yeah, she was a fat indignant lady.

157
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:45,700
Rym: the most indignant person I ever dealt with was waiting in line to go over the Lewiston bridge into Canada.

158
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:49,196
Rym: That was the most indignant I've ever seen a human being.

159
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:52,070
Scott: what about That lady who blocked the hallway?

160
00:08:52,492 --> 00:09:00,868
Rym: that lady was indignant But at the same time she was so furious when that guy said well Maybe you could lose some weights that she chooses.

161
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:04,920
Rym: She was just standing there seething and she went from indignant into hilarious.

162
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,308
Scott: Dignity is hilarious.

163
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,804
Rym: I Think that's the point.

164
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:11,629
Scott: All right.

165
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:11,991
Scott: All right.

166
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:12,895
Rym: So what do you got in the news?

167
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:13,740
Scott: What happened the news?

168
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:15,210
Scott: Okay, so what happened?

169
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,338
Rym: CES can talk about CES.

170
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,531
Scott: Well, basically, there's so much new technology.

171
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:22,400
Scott: It's sort of impossible to talk about anything.

172
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:25,551
Scott: Yeah, I'm gonna buy unless he did the whole show on it.

173
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,960
Scott: I mean we could just go down look go to Engadget.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,720
Scott: There's more stories posted on Engadget in the last two days.

175
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:38,445
Scott: There have been like the last two months and every story is like new HDTV new phone new HDTV new phone new New this new that new this.

176
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:38,747
Scott: do that.

177
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,734
Scott: It isn't that and a lot of it's cool.

178
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:42,120
Scott: A lot of its kind of.

179
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:45,874
Scott: Bill Gates made his last keynote not so exciting.

180
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:47,300
Rym: I heard it was a pretty good speech.

181
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:50,551
Scott: Yeah, I guess you know for Bill Gates normal, whatever.

182
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:52,298
Rym: Yeah, he's not the best speaker.

183
00:09:52,318 --> 00:10:00,016
Scott: Yeah I mean basically it's like, you know It really all I care about is the new technology like a lot of people reporting on the show itself.

184
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:00,899
Scott: It's like come on.

185
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:05,280
Rym: It's not like an anime con where cool things happen at the convention.

186
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:10,257
Scott: Yeah at the show tell me about the thing that things themselves and some of the things that are going on there.

187
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:10,457
Scott: now.

188
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:14,972
Rym: granted if Steve Somehow started choking on the new iPhone that I might care about that.

189
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:17,260
Scott: Yeah, Apple doesn't do too much at CES.

190
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,340
Scott: No, they do their Mac worlds in there their personal things and they're hey the Apple stores down.

191
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:25,215
Rym: Yeah, something's happening.

192
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,532
Scott: Knows we can't make a website that updates seamlessly without going down.

193
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:33,240
Rym: I think they do that on purpose to generate buzz.

194
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:35,219
Scott: I think they also do it to make it easier.

195
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:37,651
Scott: Cuz Amazon doesn't even have a problem.

196
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,440
Scott: They don't need to take their site down to update it.

197
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:48,440
Rym: Yeah, that's the one thing about not work like when I worked at IBM was like, oh we can't ever take anything down But anytime you have a server that only has to be accessed during business hours.

198
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:51,673
Rym: It is so great to just take that fucker down and do something.

199
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,360
Rym: today cherries like alright I can update the database.

200
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,128
Rym: Well, the database is now read locked.

201
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,074
Rym: The database is now down.

202
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:00,559
Rym: the database is back up.

203
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,332
Rym: Yep, as opposed to a shit someone connected.

204
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:04,397
Rym: now everything went to hell.

205
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:07,442
Scott: Yep So, yeah that Like.

206
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:10,380
Scott: I thought that this week is be full of CES news and you know what?

207
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:19,620
Scott: I think that as soon as the news starts to simmer down, you know It will boil and sediment and the most important bits of news will arise to the top and then we can discuss them.

208
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,535
Scott: but right now it's just.

209
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:26,005
Scott: This is this is this is this and this and this and this and this is this and if you actually care you can go Reading gadget or something.

210
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:36,183
Rym: All I can really say is I think I found the laptop I am going to purchase unless it unless a very small power book comes out MacBook Pro.

211
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:36,685
Scott: Well, what is?

212
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,894
Scott: the Mac world is pretty soon the Mac world?

213
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:40,580
Rym: I'm gonna hold out until Mac world.

214
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:45,802
Rym: Yeah, it's it's in a little while and pretty much if what I want comes out of Apple I'm buying that.

215
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:47,928
Rym: if it doesn't I'm buying that other laptop.

216
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:49,653
Scott: Anyway, so here's a news ready.

217
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:52,382
Scott: No, no, no, okay I'm wait.

218
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:52,844
Scott: Okay.

219
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:53,225
Rym: Now I am.

220
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:53,667
Scott: Okay.

221
00:11:53,888 --> 00:12:00,052
Scott: Okay this guy he came from Canada to Vermont I think.

222
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:04,673
Scott: well, obviously Not all the details of what happened here are listed.

223
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:05,296
Scott: So I'm not sure.

224
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:12,400
Scott: maybe I read the news already But maybe I don't have all the details of this news But I have the the most important parts that they're relevant.

225
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:16,540
Scott: The guy crossed the US Canadian border in some way and in some way it involves Vermont.

226
00:12:16,922 --> 00:12:20,460
Scott: He was suspected of having the child prawns on the computer.

227
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:26,740
Scott: I guess they had warrants to you know, search his business and all that right and so they did search his business and whatever.

228
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:29,488
Scott: But I guess they didn't have enough evidence.

229
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:30,169
Scott: right.

230
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:36,166
Scott: and this guy, you know, if he is having the child prawns It's not cool and I don't condone that.

231
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:44,937
Scott: but he was smart enough to use the PGP encryption to encrypt his stuff So that they couldn't you know decrypt his drive and see what he had on there.

232
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:45,540
Rym: All right, great.

233
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,979
Rym: So the police get the computer and say hey you've got.

234
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:53,011
Rym: well I'm surprised the police got to the point of realizing there was encryption in place.

235
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:54,455
Scott: Yeah, that's pretty.

236
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:58,087
Rym: he probably has that like PGP Disk encryptor that encrypts the whole disk.

237
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,472
Rym: You have to put a password into boot.

238
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:01,058
Rym: Maybe he's otherwise there's no way.

239
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:03,690
Scott: they'd know It's got to be something like that or they hired.

240
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,700
Rym: a forensics guy like Katsu can do that stuff.

241
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:05,940
Rym: Yeah.

242
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:13,620
Scott: But anyway, there was a subpoena from a grand jury that directed him to provide any passwords used with the laptop, right?

243
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,343
Scott: Which sort of?

244
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:17,610
Scott: and the judge right?

245
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:19,817
Scott: So he goes hey, I'm not telling you the passwords.

246
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:20,399
Scott: He can't make me.

247
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:25,380
Scott: So the judge had to decide Does he have to give up the passwords or not?

248
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:32,450
Scott: And of course if you don't give up the passwords and the judge says you have to you know what that is That's the Fifth Amendment contempt.

249
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:39,065
Scott: Oh, yeah, but the judge said no You don't have to give the passwords now because of the Fifth Amendment Exactly.

250
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,460
Scott: You don't have to incriminate yourself, right?

251
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:48,766
Scott: So I think it's pretty interesting and that when if I let's say I have in my house Something illegal drugs.

252
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:49,107
Scott: I don't know.

253
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:51,054
Scott: I don't have drugs in the house except Tylenol, I guess.

254
00:13:51,135 --> 00:13:59,580
Scott: but let's pretend I do okay, and The police are have reasonable suspicion enough to get a warrant from a judge and they want to search my house and have a warrant.

255
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,048
Scott: They're allowed to search my house with a warrant.

256
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:07,660
Scott: if I don't give them the key to my house They can either force me to give them the key or bust the door down and just search my house.

257
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,175
Scott: There's nothing that's that's legal.

258
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:09,579
Scott: now

259
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:18,851
Rym: Luckily for this guy busting the door down to PGP is a little more difficult than busting down that shoddy-ass like hollow metal frame door you've got

260
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:32,820
Scott: right now if the Basically this guy they had a warrant to search his computer and they did search his computer as much as they could But the door on his computer was not opened by a physical object and could not be opened.

261
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:36,820
Scott: I guess it could be opened by force which if they did that that would be fine.

262
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,380
Rym: But I have a feeling the statute of limitations would run out long before they decrypted his drive exactly.

263
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:48,360
Scott: It's so difficult to open by force that it's effectively unopenable right unless they get incredibly lucky.

264
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,630
Rym: You know, there was a Superman about.

265
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,338
Scott: that was there way back.

266
00:14:53,202 --> 00:15:02,580
Rym: I remember watching this where some guy Committed some crime and what he did is he locked himself in an impenetrable box until the statute of limitations ran out.

267
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:03,879
Scott: How do you know this?

268
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,722
Rym: So they tried to.

269
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:13,097
Rym: Superman tried to bust in right because they had this clock and they're like, all right The statute of limitations runs up in like 12 hours.

270
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:17,315
Rym: Superman Bust in there and get this guy and Superman couldn't bust in.

271
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:26,116
Rym: so we talked to some guy I don't know what you this guy was who taught him about Adams and how we could Faze through matter by making this Adams dodge the other Adams and like the fuse in.

272
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:26,960
Rym: where did you read this?

273
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,399
Rym: I saw it where it was a tea Superman where I saw Superman on TV.

274
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,048
Scott: Okay, black and white Superman black and white.

275
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:37,074
Scott: Yeah card live-action.

276
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:37,496
Scott: Yeah.

277
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,586
Scott: Okay, Nick at night Okay, I never saw that one.

278
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:44,898
Scott: I saw the old cartoon one which is in color, you know, doo-doo-doo.

279
00:15:45,463 --> 00:15:56,848
Rym: Superman Starts phasing through the wall and he gets halfway in and then the guy's like, oh crap Superman's coming I don't know how he knew and he's like, hey Superman What if you get stuck in that wall?

280
00:15:56,908 --> 00:15:57,530
Rym: Superman goes?

281
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,816
Rym: Ah shit, you're right and leaves.

282
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:01,407
Rym: Yeah Anyway, how they get him?

283
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:02,451
Rym: you want to know how they get him.

284
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:03,234
Scott: I don't care.

285
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:03,897
Rym: You don't care.

286
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,280
Rym: It's kind of funny All right.

287
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:12,749
Rym: So he comes out after the statute of limitations up because he's got his atomic clock in there and he's like, all right Haha, I'm out.

288
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,037
Rym: Ah, you can't arrest me.

289
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:14,460
Rym: They arrest him.

290
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,879
Rym: Anyway, Superman messed with his clock and he came out five minutes early.

291
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,220
Scott: Okay, anyway.

292
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:27,087
Scott: so yeah, basically, I think it's pretty interesting because That you Fifth Amendment.

293
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:29,436
Scott: You don't have to you know, incriminate yourself.

294
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:31,846
Scott: You can just shut up You can go to you don't have to sit.

295
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:33,172
Scott: You don't have to testify in court.

296
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:36,139
Scott: You can just be silent You don't have to say anything.

297
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:40,819
Scott: Of course anything you do say will be held against you but no one can make you say anything in the u.s.

298
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:41,547
Rym: Funny.

299
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,879
Rym: oh that's such us I mean if you really think about it.

300
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:53,979
Rym: That is such a strange right to give someone that you have to tell the truth unless something you say is Incriminating and then you don't have to say anything.

301
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,972
Scott: Well, you if you do you basically you can choose to shut up or talk.

302
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:02,120
Scott: you can basically choose between truth and shutting up.

303
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,863
Scott: You can't lie.

304
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:04,608
Rym: I mean, I'm all I'm.

305
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,512
Rym: don't get me wrong.

306
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:09,536
Rym: I'm not saying we don't need the Fifth Amendment Yeah, I'm just saying it's funny how it works out.

307
00:17:09,636 --> 00:17:12,800
Scott: so well Yeah, but I think it's pretty interesting.

308
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,740
Scott: What if I had a house like a physical house and the only way into the house?

309
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:23,180
Scott: Was with information that only I knew and I I couldn't be forced to reveal that information to incriminate myself.

310
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:26,839
Scott: I could be forced to reveal the information to incriminate someone else though.

311
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:36,219
Rym: So yeah, so as long as you murdered the guy who designed the password scheme and you buried his body in the house Yes, so it's weird.

312
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,595
Scott: I'm fully in favor of the Fifth Amendment because without it.

313
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:40,560
Scott: It'll be horrible.

314
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:42,980
Scott: It'll be like it's almost as bad as no habeas corpus.

315
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,430
Scott: But on the other hand having the Fifth Amendment.

316
00:17:45,852 --> 00:17:52,719
Scott: in a world where you know We can use information to lock things and people you know are you know?

317
00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:02,000
Scott: Basically, we can use information not beat that was protected by law To seal up evidence and make it impossible to get at legally.

318
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:05,915
Scott: It's it's easier to get away with things if you're smarter and think about this.

319
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:20,527
Rym: this wasn't even that Deniable encryption where you could give someone a key that works and decrypts data But there's no way to prove beyond any doubt at all or even any reasonable doubt even any like unreasonable doubt That there's more or less data in there.

320
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:21,791
Rym: It's perfectly deniable.

321
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:23,999
Rym: Yep within you know and layers this guy.

322
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,960
Scott: This was not the strongest most best encryption you could use for avoiding the law.

323
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,527
Scott: There are better ways to do it and that the guy did it a sort of shoddy way And he still got away with it.

324
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,974
Rym: see the moral here is pretty simple.

325
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:39,419
Scott: on his Alienware laptop Which shows you how smart this guy is you should?

326
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,339
Rym: Encrypt your important business?

327
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,910
Rym: Yeah, probably and if you're using Gmail This won't hide it from Google.

328
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:49,459
Rym: It'll hide it from other people.

329
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,621
Rym: type HTTP s Doesn't?

330
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:54,665
Scott: it does it on its own.

331
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:55,347
Rym: No it doesn't.

332
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,097
Rym: it goes back to HTTP after you log in.

333
00:18:58,117 --> 00:18:58,860
Scott: are you sure?

334
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:00,467
Rym: I sniffed it unless it's changed.

335
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,673
Scott: I'll have to check guys.

336
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:03,180
Rym: I'm logged in at work today.

337
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:09,020
Scott: You can also use fire GPG to add Pete fire PGP GPG fire GPG.

338
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,189
Scott: I'm PGP adding G to add encryption to your Gmail.

339
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,620
Rym: Yeah, don't use PGP use GPG exactly.

340
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:15,740
Rym: good

341
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,783
Scott: God all right doing news,

342
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:29,513
Rym: so I'm not gonna talk about this in depth partly because I think I want to do a whole show About it, but there's this article on slash dot by some guy Nicholas Carr who wrote a book about it Nicholas

343
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:29,758
Scott: truck

344
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,945
Rym: Nicholas autobus

345
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:33,652
Scott: out the booth.

346
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,059
Rym: that was pretty bad set up.

347
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:39,779
Rym: so basically the headline is is the IT department dead?

348
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:43,654
Scott: and As long as companies have computers probably not.

349
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:44,539
Rym: the answer is no.

350
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:47,820
Rym: Now the thing is this article is kind of weird.

351
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:55,500
Rym: I have to read it again to really figure out because it's pretty much just PR fluff to sell this book and the book is Somewhat inflammatory just to sell better.

352
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:59,420
Scott: But there seems to be a lot of people writing inflammatory books just to sell them.

353
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:02,378
Rym: But it seems like the idea here is that?

354
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:11,403
Rym: Computers are so good now and you can centralize things with things like Google so much that you don't need IT support anymore You can.

355
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,611
Rym: just people can just do it all on their own.

356
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:15,759
Rym: and the answer to that is ha ha ha.

357
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:30,397
Scott: If they I guess you know he's right in a way in that it seems like people are so Ignorant that if they just sort of did things their own way and figured out on their own Except they wouldn't not yet right then at least it's like.

358
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:43,006
Scott: right now We're in a situation where people the IT Departments are forcing the employees to do things the way that they know is best, but the employees are having hard time Doing things the best way.

359
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,051
Scott: they can't live up to that.

360
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:46,300
Rym: the thing is most employees can't even do things at all.

361
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:56,280
Scott: I know I know, but if you just let them do it on their own know that nothing will get done Or they'll just do it the best way they know how which is the best that they would do it anyway.

362
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,220
Rym: No It's actually far worse because then all your data gets compromised with spyware and Trojans.

363
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,208
Scott: All those sorts of safeguards go away.

364
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:05,773
Rym: pretty much that.

365
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:23,500
Rym: to sum my position up on this article the the the things in it that are not bullshit are very few and far between and Basically the the only thing I can really agree with is that yes It's true that most companies really kind of do redundant IT work, or it's not really even IT work.

366
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,238
Rym: It's computer work that they call IT.

367
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:33,879
Rym: but a lot of companies invest a lot of money in technology infrastructure without necessarily understanding what that infrastructure actually does.

368
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:44,768
Rym: and It's those poor and stupid uses of technology by people who don't know better that give the perception among a lot of employees and employers That technology and IT are a big money sink.

369
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:51,150
Rym: companies that use IT correctly to manage their information and their business processes Save so much money.

370
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,074
Rym: It's you.

371
00:21:52,114 --> 00:21:53,319
Rym: you couldn't even believe it.

372
00:21:53,661 --> 00:22:01,200
Rym: The problem is most people can't do that and aren't willing to pay people who know how to do it and are willing to learn How to do it because it's not easy.

373
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,994
Scott: It requires lots of changing the way you think about business and the way you do business.

374
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:09,315
Scott: you have to change and people fear change More than they fear anything else.

375
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:15,080
Rym: Yep The sunk cost fallacy is probably the biggest thing holding back IT infrastructure in the entire world today.

376
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,389
Scott: Probably the sunk cost fallacy holding a lot of things back.

377
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:23,470
Rym: Yeah now, uh, you know the sunk cost fallacy I think keeps a lot of people playing World of Warcraft.

378
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:25,401
Rym: Yeah, I already made it to level 60.

379
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:29,968
Scott: It also keeps a lot of people from dropping out of school Yeah, and that's that's funny.

380
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:30,510
Rym: But you know what?

381
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,759
Rym: There are a lot of people at RIT who probably should have dropped out.

382
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:38,060
Rym: Yep, we had some friends who were smart enough to drop out early on and go somewhere that was more suited to them.

383
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,114
Rym: Things of the day.

384
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,421
Rym: so, uh, we like Futurama.

385
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,330
Rym: the new Futurama was okay wasn't super great.

386
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,237
Rym: It was pretty good.

387
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,103
Scott: It was okay.

388
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:53,930
Scott: It got some chuckles.

389
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,160
Scott: I think the Family Guy movie was better than the Futurama movie.

390
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,256
Scott: as far as direct-to-video Fox cartoons go I think you're forgetting.

391
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:03,881
Rym: everybody loves Hypno toad.

392
00:23:04,323 --> 00:23:06,450
Scott: That was the when the extras better than the movie.

393
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:07,270
Scott: That's not a good thing.

394
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,485
Rym: That was that was one of the defining moments in my life is watching an entire episode of.

395
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:12,650
Rym: everybody loves Hypno toad.

396
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,292
Scott: Are you serious?

397
00:23:13,332 --> 00:23:14,395
Scott: Not ironically.

398
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:15,117
Rym: Are you serious?

399
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:17,384
Rym: Not best moments defining moments.

400
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,230
Rym: It defined a part of me.

401
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:25,790
Scott: I think that part of me was defined on an April Fool's Day many years past and that this was just a reminder of that.

402
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:35,835
Rym: I was not party to that because I while I caused that April Fool's Day that that that momentous occasion for many other people I Did not suffer through it.

403
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:40,951
Rym: I in fact was standing outside the room waiting for people to figure it out and I didn't suffer through It.

404
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:47,230
Scott: but I sat there sort of watching the other suffer through it, but I watch Hypno toad non-ironically.

405
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,075
Rym: Anyway, I'll make this quick.

406
00:23:49,115 --> 00:23:53,350
Rym: Remember when bender brewed beer inside bender bender brow?

407
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,315
Scott: Yeah, that's a good episode.

408
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:59,967
Rym: someone made a bender that you can in which you can brew beer.

409
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:04,239
Scott: Does it have a Poorly placed tap possibly.

410
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,042
Rym: No, it doesn't.

411
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:05,564
Scott: I thought it.

412
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:06,267
Scott: I know it does.

413
00:24:06,387 --> 00:24:06,990
Scott: actually I saw it.

414
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,234
Rym: I didn't actually look at it yet.

415
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:10,984
Scott: The tap is in a quite a bad position.

416
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:11,586
Scott: Oh, wow.

417
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:17,335
Rym: Yes Okay This is however Extremely well done.

418
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:25,266
Rym: like the level of quality is too much effort Wallet it reeks of effort while it reeks of effort at the same time kind of effort.

419
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:26,270
Scott: bender would not expend.

420
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:28,229
Rym: It is really really cool.

421
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:35,109
Rym: Now the only thing the only thing that worries me is I really really hope that no one tries to have sex with it.

422
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,709
Scott: Okay Anyway, this is a funny video that's gone around the Internet's.

423
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:47,412
Scott: You've probably seen it already if you're paying attention the Internet's but maybe you haven't seen it and the videos called you suck at Photoshop Number one.

424
00:24:47,873 --> 00:24:55,350
Scott: Oh you're doing this and basically some guy made a little Photoshop tutorial and I thought you know I wasn't quite sure what it was when I watched it.

425
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,358
Scott: I just saw links that said you suck at Photoshop.

426
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:02,236
Rym: click here and suck is spelled wrong in that kind of Spelled wrong on the YouTube.

427
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:05,485
Rym: So but all the posts I saw to it were sujk.

428
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,230
Scott: Well, it's as you see K on YouTube.

429
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:18,910
Scott: But anyway, there's a video and this guy it's just a screencast of his Mac where he's got Photoshop and says other Adobe photo program and he's Talking over this screen capture, right?

430
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,809
Scott: And he's basically gonna demo how to do some stuff in Photoshop and he sort of does.

431
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,179
Scott: He taught me how to do stuff in Photoshop.

432
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:26,863
Scott: I didn't know how to do.

433
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,733
Scott: I don't have Photoshop those It doesn't matter.

434
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:30,504
Scott: and I was pretty interesting.

435
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:40,695
Scott: It's He's sort of in his Photoshop tutorial telling a story in the way a humorous Story and it's.

436
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:55,910
Scott: I feel like this sort of joke has been done before but I can't remember exactly when and where and this is a good execution of this joke and Humor is there and if you want to be making the funnies, you should be watching this video.

437
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:58,021
Rym: I found this just utterly hilarious.

438
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:58,805
Rym: I don't know what it is.

439
00:25:59,026 --> 00:25:59,830
Scott: It's pretty funny.

440
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,593
Scott: I didn't think was utterly.

441
00:26:00,613 --> 00:26:11,582
Rym: I think what made it hilarious for me is that I've always liked very kind of Straight man humor like Steven Wright always so that with a deadpan straight face You know your dictionary zebra did it never did.

442
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:12,847
Rym: awesome dehydrated water.

443
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:15,882
Rym: now I don't know what to add got some spot remover.

444
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:16,565
Rym: Now.

445
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:17,510
Rym: I can't find my dog.

446
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:33,900
Rym: I just I love that sort of deadpan humor and I think what makes makes something like doubly funny for me is if you could look at it and maybe if you weren't the brightest bulb or if you weren't paying attention or just it is Conceivable that you would watch it and not realize it was a joke.

447
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:37,511
Scott: I think that's something that excellent humor does very well.

448
00:26:37,531 --> 00:26:45,300
Scott: is that it makes the person laughing at it feel smart that you know If you're if you tell a joke right that anyone in the world will get the joke.

449
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:52,074
Scott: But anyone who gets the joke feels like other people won't get the joke whether they will or they won't.

450
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:57,719
Scott: Penny arcade and I know that only video game people understand it.

451
00:26:58,145 --> 00:26:59,159
Scott: It adds to the joke.

452
00:26:59,421 --> 00:27:02,540
Scott: So the best joke in the world is the inside joke.

453
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:06,855
Scott: But the best joke in the world can't be an inside joke because it's funny to so few people.

454
00:27:06,895 --> 00:27:12,880
Scott: you need a joke where everyone Feels like it's an inside joke or it makes them feel smarter or better than other people.

455
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:16,175
Scott: But it makes everyone feel that way and that's just perfect joke.

456
00:27:16,396 --> 00:27:18,305
Rym: It wasn't overdone it wasn't overproduced.

457
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:23,583
Rym: all the all the quips and all the humorous bits were Extremely subtle.

458
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:24,727
Rym: like they they were.

459
00:27:24,787 --> 00:27:28,380
Scott: subtly starts out real subtle and he gets less subtle as it goes on.

460
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,631
Rym: Yeah, but even then it's in such a believable progression in terms of like.

461
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:37,099
Rym: you could see someone doing this not as a joke But you know, this is a joke.

462
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:42,640
Rym: But yet, you know, there are people out there who feel like this and have done this sort of thing and it wasn't a joke.

463
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,966
Rym: Yep, I hope it was a joke.

464
00:27:45,528 --> 00:27:46,270
Scott: All right main bit.

465
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:46,992
Rym: All right.

466
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:50,182
Rym: So speaking of having sex with bender Oh good.

467
00:27:50,222 --> 00:27:55,660
Rym: God hungry Joe posts in the forums a while ago, and I'm surprised how little discussion is generated.

468
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:57,900
Scott: Well, you wanted to talk about this.

469
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:03,241
Rym: So well part the other reason I really wanted to talk about this because Scott couldn't come up with anything better and he agreed To it.

470
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:03,582
Scott: Yeah.

471
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:06,332
Scott: Well, I I'm still because you wanted to do this.

472
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:06,653
Scott: you had.

473
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:11,860
Rym: it's up to you to get the discussion rolling Alright, well basically this was what was posted in our forum.

474
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:28,205
Rym: David Levy has a new book title love and sex with robots in which he predicts that robot technology will allow for such human-like creations in the near future that we can follow in love with them that the robots can at least mimic that they love us back and that they will be Viable sex partners.

475
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:32,980
Rym: now I submit to you that this has already occurred and my evidence is the dildo.

476
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,000
Rym: It is a viable sex partner.

477
00:28:35,462 --> 00:28:40,640
Rym: It may not love you back unless you have double D cells, but it is in fact a viable sex partner.

478
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,965
Rym: You can have sex with it.

479
00:28:42,205 --> 00:28:45,537
Scott: Yeah, I have a better evidence than that that this has already happened.

480
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:46,320
Scott: real dolls?

481
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:49,300
Scott: No, the the moe is there.

482
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:58,793
Scott: I mean there are sick dudes out there that I do not condone but they honestly I think these sicko people They honestly fall in love with these animated fictional character.

483
00:28:58,813 --> 00:28:58,914
Rym: Now.

484
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:00,720
Rym: We're not talking 4chan fat thing.

485
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,405
Rym: We're not talking someone masturbates to it.

486
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:09,987
Rym: We're talking people actually have real strong emotions toward moe characters and bad shows.

487
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:17,813
Scott: yeah, these people actually have fictional characters and while they may not physically have Sex with a fictional character because it's just a drawing on it.

488
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:19,140
Rym: Oh, you can print it out.

489
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,690
Scott: Yeah, they might print it out or they might have.

490
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:22,875
Rym: they might have a real.

491
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:24,060
Rym: I wasn't being serious.

492
00:29:24,422 --> 00:29:27,959
Rym: I don't think many people have printed out a piece of paper on their inkjet and then had sex with it.

493
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:28,783
Scott: No, but they had.

494
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:34,610
Scott: these people have like real dolls and they have all sorts of sicko stuff that I you know I creased me out.

495
00:29:34,832 --> 00:29:43,337
Scott: I'm not comfortable with it But there are people out there who are effectively falling in love with and having sex with things that are not human beings.

496
00:29:43,357 --> 00:29:46,026
Rym: I Just I was thinking of disturbing things.

497
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:57,133
Scott: All right, so yeah, it's all disturbing but it's it's happening and I really don't see having sex with say a Robot sort of Android that imitates a human being being much different.

498
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,302
Rym: Well, I think there is definitely a Separation.

499
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:09,153
Rym: I mean some people can make this distinction some people don't but a lot of people do very much separate Sex and love or sex and emotion people.

500
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:09,916
Scott: I separate them.

501
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:17,260
Scott: people will have sex They can go together but they are two separate things and they will enjoy their best together sort of like chips and salsa.

502
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:21,674
Scott: But you can just eat salsa and you can just eat chips if you want to.

503
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,460
Rym: it was actually a pretty apt analogy.

504
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:25,408
Rym: Yeah, all right to continue this.

505
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,120
Rym: of course, there is nothing new with this prediction.

506
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,768
Rym: It's one of the oldest tropes in science fiction, you know.

507
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:37,570
Rym: that trope guy makes a robot falls in love with the robot Robot kills him because it doesn't actually love him back and doesn't.

508
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,412
Rym: it's just a machine.

509
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:42,065
Scott: Yeah every ghost in the shell story Yeah, half of them.

510
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:45,498
Rym: Well, the other half of ghost in the shell is it's not actually a machine.

511
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:46,060
Rym: It's sentient.

512
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:47,186
Scott: Yes, what do we do?

513
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:48,191
Scott: 75% of Masamune shiro stories?

514
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:55,474
Rym: They can say one thing though 100% of Masamune shiro stories have the big butt.

515
00:30:56,016 --> 00:30:56,176
Rym: Yeah.

516
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:56,858
Rym: Okay.

517
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:57,340
Rym: It's there.

518
00:30:57,742 --> 00:31:00,500
Scott: Yeah, that guy let's get the bus shiro tasm.

519
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:06,480
Rym: If we'd done an episode on shiro just like as like the body of his work just go on with what you're talking about.

520
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,325
Scott: So I'm trying to kill time.

521
00:31:07,627 --> 00:31:10,605
Rym: I'm not trying to kill time mustn't kill time boy Must spend time.

522
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:17,360
Rym: Let's cherish it like five bucks to go get loaded loaded on Sexy robots, right?

523
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,559
Rym: So can we become so attached to a machine that we can be said to love it?

524
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,560
Rym: Would we feel gratified if a machine mimic?

525
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,939
Scott: And if you're asking questions, why don't we answer them one at a time one by one?

526
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:33,652
Rym: All right, so can't know let's do this in the royal we sense as humans.

527
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:35,477
Rym: can human the royal?

528
00:31:35,497 --> 00:31:37,629
Scott: we saw only Kings Which includes me.

529
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:43,619
Rym: can Humans become so attached to machines that they can be said to love them?

530
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,488
Rym: now I think before I mean, I think the real tricky part here is that you know people always assume All right, it's either human or it isn't.

531
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,059
Rym: it's either a machine or it's a human being.

532
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:57,600
Rym: But what exactly is the line between sentience and not sentience?

533
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:06,232
Rym: During tests during tests, uh, I'm just picking something I know cuz I submit that there are some.

534
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:11,731
Rym: there have been several monkeys Well apes at least in history that could pass the Turing test.

535
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,135
Rym: All right, so are they sentient?

536
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:17,028
Rym: maybe so well Maybe you can't I don't know.

537
00:32:17,108 --> 00:32:18,594
Scott: I'm just I'm just shooting out there.

538
00:32:18,734 --> 00:32:22,591
Rym: I know I'm not making a stance yet I mean, I think the Turing test is the closest we've got.

539
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:29,680
Rym: but even then that really only takes into account human intelligence or intelligence recognizable as Exactly what we expect.

540
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,980
Scott: I know some incredible alien could come with advanced alien technology and still not understand the Turing test to be able to take it.

541
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:39,162
Rym: So I guess all right is sentience the line I mean.

542
00:32:39,202 --> 00:32:40,546
Rym: what is it?

543
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:49,289
Rym: What makes having sex with the dildo different from having sex with say your Real doll, but or your pool cleaner.

544
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:53,840
Scott: Well, if you're talking about sex alone, right just the salsa, right?

545
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,359
Scott: I don't know why sex is the salsa, but

546
00:32:56,802 --> 00:33:05,820
Rym: You know, it seems to fit because I don't I wouldn't want to have sex with a chip But having sex with salsa wouldn't be that bad unless unless it was a habanero salsa

547
00:33:06,881 --> 00:33:08,547
Scott: You could just if you sealed the tip.

548
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:09,350
Scott: it wouldn't be so again.

549
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,116
Rym: Anyway, let's not go there.

550
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:12,059
Scott: Let's not go there.

551
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:15,796
Scott: All right, if you're talking about just the salsa, I just pictured everyone in the front row.

552
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:19,235
Rym: crew was thinking to themselves I'm never fucking having salsa at rims house again.

553
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:24,365
Scott: good more for us Untainted salsa Of course.

554
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:26,178
Scott: if they see us eating it they'll know not to eat it.

555
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:35,233
Scott: They'll know it's safe to eat.

556
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:37,497
Scott: if we right we have to eat it in secret.

557
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:38,038
Scott: so they don't know.

558
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:42,519
Scott: They don't know which sauces are good and which ones are tainted anyway.

559
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,544
Rym: So what were you saying?

560
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:46,314
Scott: I was saying you're talking about just salsa.

561
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:47,539
Scott: You got to get the good.

562
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:53,667
Scott: now If you're talking about just salsa just sex, right Sex on its own is just.

563
00:33:54,089 --> 00:34:03,678
Scott: you're playing with parts of your body that happen have a lot of nerve you're stimulating nerve endings and then your brain is releasing chemicals that make you feel good and That's about it.

564
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,175
Scott: So whatever way you make that happen if that's your only goal is to it's.

565
00:34:09,195 --> 00:34:09,657
Scott: basically.

566
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:11,924
Scott: it's no different than like You know snorting cocaine.

567
00:34:11,964 --> 00:34:16,800
Scott: your brain releases chemicals that make you feel good because you stimulated nerve endings.

568
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:19,793
Scott: I mean anyway, you stimulate those nerve endings.

569
00:34:20,395 --> 00:34:21,299
Scott: What's wrong with that?

570
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:24,560
Rym: I mean doesn't matter how because it's kind of relevant ghost in the shell.

571
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:39,900
Rym: there was that there's a lot of talk in the manga about the idea that if you're a cyborg or if we have such Technologies where we can understand the brain so well instead of having physical sex people can just stimulate each other's pleasure centers directly.

572
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:43,070
Rym: Yep, and does that still count as salsa?

573
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:52,527
Scott: Yeah, I mean it might be more fun if say someone else who are stimulating your nerve endings in a Unpredictable or superior fashion.

574
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:53,853
Scott: because you know, there are certain ways.

575
00:34:53,913 --> 00:34:55,659
Scott: It's not easy to stimulate the nerve endings.

576
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:02,328
Scott: They're pretty complex, you know and on your own you can only do so many things and with more people You can do different things.

577
00:35:02,428 --> 00:35:04,480
Rym: Everybody was gaga deep in other people.

578
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:09,940
Scott: Yeah, and with a robot the right kind of robot, maybe there'd be more possibilities available to you.

579
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,907
Scott: But if you're just talking about nerve ending stimulation Anything goes.

580
00:35:14,967 --> 00:35:16,860
Rym: I guess, you know, there's actually a comic I remember.

581
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:25,260
Rym: I don't remember if this was a thin H line or if it was a Sunday morning coffee But it was a lab and they made a sex bot.

582
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,980
Rym: It was up, you know, but classic anime kind of micro 2010 the perverted manga not the cute anime.

583
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:33,267
Rym: It's a robot you have sex with.

584
00:35:33,427 --> 00:35:38,432
Rym: oh my god, and the scientists are of course men and the woman scientist is like What's wrong with you?

585
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:39,140
Rym: This is disgusting.

586
00:35:39,381 --> 00:35:47,448
Rym: Why would you have sex with a machine and then blah blah blah blah and then that night she's using her dildo And then she stopped.

587
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:48,414
Rym: she's like wait a minute.

588
00:35:48,918 --> 00:35:49,937
Rym: Ah Damn it.

589
00:35:50,783 --> 00:35:51,004
Scott: Yep.

590
00:35:51,265 --> 00:35:51,466
Scott: All right.

591
00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:52,550
Scott: So now you're gonna talk about the chips.

592
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,333
Scott: You wanna talk about the chips.

593
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,381
Rym: Maybe we should talk about the chips All right.

594
00:35:55,422 --> 00:36:03,389
Scott: So the thing with the chips right is that you basically have a strong Emotional attachment to another person.

595
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,693
Scott: that's considered normal.

596
00:36:04,794 --> 00:36:05,135
Scott: I guess.

597
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:05,636
Rym: Okay.

598
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:06,499
Rym: Well, it's it's love.

599
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:07,784
Rym: now We can start.

600
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:09,451
Rym: I mean first, you know, we have to define our terms.

601
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:10,235
Rym: what is love?

602
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:13,370
Scott: it's love It's the words love.

603
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:15,080
Rym: all you need is love.

604
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:29,680
Scott: Okay, right, but it it's viewed by me and I guess other people that having a strong Emotional attachment right because the strongest emotional attachment people ever have is to like, you know people they fall in love with right?

605
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,140
Scott: You really that's that's pretty much what comes down to and you know, you can have emotional attachments to other things.

606
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:41,840
Scott: But if they're that strong, it's sort of disturbing, you know, I mean like some people might love their teddy bear.

607
00:36:42,323 --> 00:36:47,468
Scott: but if you love your teddy bear as much as you love Your wife that's sort of like.

608
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:49,475
Scott: yeah, it's a little weird.

609
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:50,458
Rym: See now it's easy to.

610
00:36:50,478 --> 00:36:52,332
Rym: I mean It's kind of like with a lot of arguments.

611
00:36:52,372 --> 00:37:00,700
Rym: It's very easy to say Well, that's and that's just because that's kinky and that's boobah Yeah, just because there's such a stark comparison.

612
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,374
Rym: But what about say the love for a pet versus the love for a fellow human being?

613
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:08,945
Rym: because now it's a lot closer in terms Of you know, it's a living thing.

614
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:12,696
Rym: It's it's it's it's probably intelligent to some degree.

615
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:15,527
Rym: it can respond Organically that sort of thing.

616
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:18,480
Rym: What about again, it comes down to sentience.

617
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,242
Rym: What's the line?

618
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:24,620
Rym: is love with a sentient being shared love different from one way love with a non sentient item?

619
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:31,900
Scott: Yeah, I mean do you really care if someone else has and I mean someone having an emotional attachment is something that's not real?

620
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Scott: All right, I guess the robot is definitely real, right?

621
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,157
Scott: but I mean something that is not, you know, a human or is not the same species.

622
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:42,925
Scott: whatever is Disturbing.

623
00:37:42,945 --> 00:37:49,500
Scott: I don't know exactly why is disturbing and have to think about it for a minute And I can't really think if I'm saying stuff like this, but it is disturbing.

624
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:50,803
Rym: That's the thing.

625
00:37:50,843 --> 00:37:57,220
Rym: if you it's very this kind of argument or we're not really arguing It's just kind of a debate because I don't really have a position me there at all.

626
00:37:57,521 --> 00:37:59,469
Rym: but there's the you can.

627
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,463
Rym: you can look at it from a purely like Subjective.

628
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:06,660
Rym: Well, I like this and I don't like this and this is okay This isn't okay.

629
00:38:06,981 --> 00:38:11,274
Rym: And you can also kind of remove yourself from it and look at it from a purely clinical kind of.

630
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,040
Rym: what exactly is the line?

631
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,446
Rym: You know like like bestiality.

632
00:38:14,486 --> 00:38:17,220
Rym: there's a word I can throw out there since we're throwing out words.

633
00:38:17,623 --> 00:38:19,397
Scott: Well, I think the problem with bestiality

634
00:38:19,437 --> 00:38:35,580
Rym: is that Regardless of that just I know what you're gonna say, but for me purely like emotional or subjective stance most people are disgusted by the idea of bestiality or a lot of things like that and They wouldn't really think about exactly why it bothers them.

635
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,711
Rym: There's kind of just this innate disgust for it.

636
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:48,940
Rym: and yet at the same time clinically if you remove the emotion entirely you can look at it and say Alright well, obviously the non-sentient or the animal or whatever cannot give consent and blah blah blah danger.

637
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:50,703
Rym: And there's kind of.

638
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:53,451
Rym: there's two perspectives both of which condemn it.

639
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:54,013
Rym: Yep.

640
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,440
Rym: What do you do when it's not so clear-cut?

641
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,433
Rym: What uh, what about a computer or an Android or a robot?

642
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:02,320
Rym: That is I wrote it in basic.

643
00:39:02,785 --> 00:39:04,240
Rym: I know I wrote it a hundred percent.

644
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:08,879
Rym: I know exactly how it works because I wrote the software and someone else falls in love with it.

645
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:12,600
Rym: Didn't they just fall in love with me by proxy or my programming skills?

646
00:39:13,202 --> 00:39:14,064
Scott: I don't know it.

647
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:18,840
Scott: it's I mean people fall in love with other people's creations all the time.

648
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:19,428
Scott: I mean people.

649
00:39:19,468 --> 00:39:20,117
Scott: have you know?

650
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:23,350
Scott: Someone made that anime that moe show.

651
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,500
Scott: there's some artist character designer and then someone else fell in love with it.

652
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,607
Scott: They didn't fall in love with the character designer they don't even know the characters, but maybe they did.

653
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:45,730
Rym: because think about it if you fall in love with an entity that was created wholly and Predictably by a person then you fall in love with something that was in created entirely by that person's mind And by proxy that person's creative output.

654
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:52,837
Scott: So if I fall in love with someone I'm I fall in love with their mom Because the mom did not create unambiguously the person.

655
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,898
Scott: now What if they Jeanette we get in the future and we're genetically engineering children.

656
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:58,083
Scott: exactly That's that.

657
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:04,471
Rym: if it was down to the point where you programmed the brain a hundred percent Exactly, because that's what I was saying.

658
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:05,960
Rym: It's a cyborg that I programmed.

659
00:40:06,463 --> 00:40:07,229
Rym: I know the code.

660
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,920
Rym: the code does not act randomly.

661
00:40:10,342 --> 00:40:13,219
Rym: The reactions it gives someone else could fall in love with it.

662
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:16,166
Rym: But yet I know Well it reacted that way.

663
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:20,060
Rym: it hugged them because it saw that their pupils were dilated by this degree and that sort of thing.

664
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:26,851
Scott: But how do you how do you explain when say there's a work of art that I may enjoy Yet the person who created that work of art.

665
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:28,520
Scott: I do not like them and that happens often.

666
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:30,208
Rym: Oh, that's very versa.

667
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,540
Scott: where I like someone like I said, I don't like their art.

668
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,086
Rym: They didn't fall in love with the person.

669
00:40:34,106 --> 00:40:36,435
Rym: you fell in love with the output of the person.

670
00:40:36,495 --> 00:40:40,588
Rym: what you fell in love with Was a construct that that person created.

671
00:40:41,009 --> 00:40:45,240
Rym: Yep, actually and even further think about what's the uh, what's the line?

672
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,671
Rym: What is love versus?

673
00:40:46,731 --> 00:40:51,871
Rym: I mean, I've had emotional Attachment and attraction to a lot of characters in fiction.

674
00:40:52,332 --> 00:40:54,620
Rym: I've cried over people who never lived.

675
00:40:54,981 --> 00:41:00,518
Rym: Yep, is that different than falling in love with something that didn't exist or only existed in someone else's mind.

676
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:01,140
Rym: What's the line?

677
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:10,920
Scott: I guess there's some sort of you know line that we sort of invent Semantically that doesn't really have a provable real space.

678
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:13,166
Scott: You know physical line that you know.

679
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:23,497
Scott: when you are attached to something enough then it suddenly becomes like, you know Undying love and hope some holy time bound to you by change that only omnipotence can bright.

680
00:41:23,577 --> 00:41:24,320
Scott: and it's sort of like.

681
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:28,640
Scott: You know, no one can say exactly where the line is or whatever and whatever.

682
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,560
Scott: But I guess that's you know, that's what it's considered to be in in popular opinion.

683
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:37,573
Rym: But alright, so someone falls in love with the lot the got the line.

684
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:39,379
Rym: the machine I made that I wrote in basic.

685
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:46,260
Rym: now Let's say I made a machine that was a neural network, whatever and it goes in the shell style.

686
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:54,379
Rym: Effectively could pass the Turing test and as far as I could tell I could not predict its reactions a hundred percent anymore.

687
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:58,899
Rym: and Effectively as far as anyone can tell is sentient.

688
00:41:59,882 --> 00:42:01,106
Rym: But it's a machine that I made.

689
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:12,817
Scott: I will what if I make a person a real person out of Atoms because I have nanotechnology and when I'm done, they're biologically identical to a you know, human being.

690
00:42:12,857 --> 00:42:14,303
Scott: they're in the same species And everything.

691
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:19,375
Scott: they can even make babies one way or the other depending on the gender I make it and you fall in love with that.

692
00:42:19,395 --> 00:42:20,762
Scott: It's no different I think.

693
00:42:20,862 --> 00:42:28,123
Rym: what it comes down to my personal belief is that love between any two set be any two Entities.

694
00:42:28,183 --> 00:42:31,171
Rym: I can't say being because what's the difference between an organic?

695
00:42:31,231 --> 00:42:31,793
Rym: what like what's that?

696
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:32,335
Rym: What's a being?

697
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:37,740
Rym: but a plant is dendrophilius between any two any n entities.

698
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:45,005
Rym: I can't discriminate here any feelings of emotion between n entities of Similar levels of sentience.

699
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,473
Rym: I cannot find fault with them.

700
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:49,560
Scott: Yeah, it's really hard to figure out.

701
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,082
Scott: It's.

702
00:42:50,122 --> 00:42:53,680
Scott: it's hard to say there's something wrong with anything unless someone's getting hurt.

703
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,250
Scott: I mean sometimes this kind of stuff.

704
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:02,439
Scott: There's someone getting hurt, you know, like One person loves someone else who isn't and they're not loved back.

705
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,440
Scott: Someone is in love with something and it's you know, it can't give consent cuz like an animal.

706
00:43:09,641 --> 00:43:12,980
Rym: Yeah, if I love a cactus that relationship is not going to and it's not good.

707
00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:20,200
Scott: Not the crushinator or even whatever robot falls in love with a person and the person doesn't you know love robots.

708
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,668
Scott: They love people only and they're not attracted to robot.

709
00:43:22,688 --> 00:43:24,494
Rym: I think there was a tessica about that.

710
00:43:24,654 --> 00:43:32,625
Scott: Yeah, mayhaps mayhaps Yes, and that the person could end up getting hurt by the crazed robot, you know Which is incredibly powerful and strong.

711
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:35,494
Rym: or maybe the robot is hurt by the person.

712
00:43:35,815 --> 00:43:37,620
Scott: Maybe the robot is hurt by the person.

713
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:38,653
Rym: I guess it just.

714
00:43:38,794 --> 00:43:44,020
Rym: I Cannot find fault with beings of similar sentience sharing emotional attachment.

715
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:55,797
Rym: As a result if there are sentient machines or machines that are effectively sentient and someone has feelings for it I can't look at that any differently than I look at someone having feelings for another human being.

716
00:43:55,818 --> 00:43:56,420
Scott: right now.

717
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,751
Scott: Here's another thing to look at right?

718
00:43:57,993 --> 00:44:10,500
Scott: There's a lot of basically, we you fall you biologically, you're attracted to other things in your species right, you know because you know evolution and things.

719
00:44:10,843 --> 00:44:12,700
Scott: You know things that were attracted.

720
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:26,040
Scott: You know in any sort of non asexual organism right being biologically Programmed to be attracted to sexually and emotionally to things that you can procreate with is sort of an advantage.

721
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,457
Scott: You know, that's that's sort of how you know, it worked out, you know, if you didn't have that you'd have.

722
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:53,877
Scott: you know Like men and women not wanting each other and then they wouldn't make babies and humans wouldn't be around anymore Right now that gene or the genes that you know cause that you know are not present in everybody And you know you end up having some people who really can only you know Have these feelings toward things in their own species and some people can have it towards in their species and not.

723
00:44:53,917 --> 00:45:02,829
Scott: and some of this You know stuff is you know, even have you know gender stuff going on and some of this is biological and some of it is not.

724
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:11,887
Scott: and The question might be is it good for the future of the species if we you know Take the selection pressure off of that?

725
00:45:11,987 --> 00:45:32,019
Scott: and now maybe one day in the future when robots are So much better and you know than people because you just program the robot to be everything You know the perfect thing for you to love and we stop, you know We totally lose our attraction for people in the same species of you know The opposite gender for procreating and whatnot.

726
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:41,940
Rym: But what did even matter if we had full control over our genetic destiny and we just programmed ourselves or even became What if he had full control over robots but not yet full control over genetics?

727
00:45:42,642 --> 00:45:53,160
Rym: See, I think the fundamental question and ain't any time this sort of issue comes up just comes down to very simply What is the seat of human consciousness because that determines the answers to a lot of these questions?

728
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,516
Scott: Like what about that episode of Futurama where he he's doing the robot and then everyone's doing robots?

729
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:00,564
Rym: and if everyone's doing robots And there's no more people.

730
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:00,926
Rym: Yep.

731
00:46:01,288 --> 00:46:01,589
Rym: Yeah.

732
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:03,016
Rym: Yeah, that's tricky.

733
00:46:03,298 --> 00:46:10,680
Scott: It is tricky And it and see that that's a situation where there could be some harm if everyone's doing robots and then we run out of people.

734
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:11,564
Scott: Oh, wow.

735
00:46:11,745 --> 00:46:13,673
Rym: I realized that looking at the rest of the questions here.

736
00:46:13,694 --> 00:46:14,778
Rym: We kind of answered most of them.

737
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:15,080
Scott: Did we?

738
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:21,920
Rym: Alright, alright Would we feel gratified if a machine mimicked loving us back or would we realize that it was just acting in accordance with its programming?

739
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,674
Scott: Well, I think that some people would and some people wouldn't.

740
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:33,298
Rym: I mean, I think Some people have a lot of difficulty Understanding how other people fanboys are a good example of this.

741
00:46:34,184 --> 00:46:47,810
Rym: Running the RIT anime club, you know as the president I I had to be like the public face for the club and a lot of people would Congregate around in like the social areas of club and I had to I kind of keep the peace and talk to everyone and be Like hey you how's it going?

742
00:46:47,830 --> 00:47:08,122
Rym: Hey blah blah, but Scott and all my friends could tell When I was totally blowing someone off and ignoring what they were saying But I was mimicking the right body posture in the right body language and I was doing the things that basically trick another person into Thinking that I'm engaged with them there.

743
00:47:08,182 --> 00:47:16,480
Rym: there are a lot of things you can do if you want to I guess in of Influence or effect the way someone perceives the way you speak just by using body language a certain way.

744
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:21,900
Rym: It's not out of the realm that you could program a computer that did those same sorts of calculations.

745
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,663
Scott: But aren't we gonna?

746
00:47:22,724 --> 00:47:30,838
Scott: we're gonna have to you know cross the uncanny valley of Emotion there and I think all that takes is more computing power and more time.

747
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:43,146
Rym: Yep I mean the uncanny valley is an interesting phenomenon Which I've read multiple articles asserting that the reason it exists is because things that are alien or foreign We don't really have any sort of.

748
00:47:43,166 --> 00:48:01,820
Rym: we don't have to worry about because historically in the in the past of humanity Things that were very alien to us were different kinds of dangers But things that were very similar or almost normal But a little bit off often indicated disease or malformation or problems like that.

749
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:16,179
Rym: I mean I saw a lot of studies where people were sickened and disgusted by certain kinds of images and yet we're not bothered at all by other very similar kinds of images and the Images that bother them were in the uncanny valley and similar to things that cause disease

750
00:48:16,863 --> 00:48:17,085
Scott: Mm-hmm.

751
00:48:18,132 --> 00:48:23,939
Rym: So yeah anyway What a robot necessarily be mimicking or could it possibly begin feeling?

752
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:36,900
Rym: I I don't know what the seed of human consciousness is but I am Lee I'm about I'm 40% give or take leaning toward the idea that My intelligence is just the emergent behavior of a complex system.

753
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:42,016
Rym: And if that is the case, then robots can most definitely feel as much as I can.

754
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:44,726
Rym: Yeah, eventually There's no reason they couldn't.

755
00:48:45,348 --> 00:48:52,460
Rym: there's no reason any sufficiently complex system couldn't be Self-reflective in the same way that I am especially if I give it a fusiform gyrus.

756
00:48:52,862 --> 00:49:05,779
Scott: Yeah, but I guess this is sort of idea that feelings are somehow Special in some like there's some holy, you know Sac, you know, what was the word sacred sacred kind of thing?

757
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:12,600
Scott: Feelings are just chemical, you know results of the emergent, you know thing for the complex system.

758
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:26,280
Rym: I mean if that's the case because we don't I mean all we know is that I mean I feel emotions humans feel emotions And they're very powerful and it's very difficult to separate yourself From the emotions you feel and it's very difficult to clinically observe.

759
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:36,887
Rym: I mean, let's say that someday we map the brain perfectly and we're able to say without a doubt This is where every like each emotion This is how it forms and where it comes from.

760
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:39,716
Rym: and here's how look I can make a device.

761
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:44,940
Rym: you hit the button and it Makes you angry even it and you don't even know why you hit the button and it makes you happy.

762
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:46,970
Rym: We could understand it a hundred percent.

763
00:49:47,311 --> 00:49:51,499
Rym: and if that sort of thing is possible I don't know how a lot of people would deal with that knowledge.

764
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:55,009
Rym: Yeah I think a lot of people wouldn't believe it because it were.

765
00:49:55,049 --> 00:50:08,934
Rym: so it's very difficult to divorce yourself from your own perception of reality And kind of be self-reflective in that kind of clinical Objective way kind of like how it's very difficult for people to admit to their own inner failings to themselves.

766
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:09,817
Scott: Mm-hmm.

767
00:50:10,378 --> 00:50:12,851
Rym: All right Blah blah blah blah.

768
00:50:13,356 --> 00:50:20,100
Rym: if mr Levy walked in on his spouse using a robot as a sex partner would he be right to feel jealous or angry?

769
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:38,774
Scott: Well, I think there's sort of a you know, I guess another thing that's possibly biological instinctual that's been brought over over the years that you know You see, you know, we've grown into being some sort of this monogamous relationship At least humans have for the most part, you know sort of monogamous and whatnots

770
00:50:39,376 --> 00:50:40,098
Rym: and I'll give us

771
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:40,560
Scott: what not.

772
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,740
Scott: So, you know one man one partner of some kind, you know.

773
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:58,220
Scott: And then you don't want the partner to be going with anyone else because then you feel like hey You know, they love them more than they love me, you know, you it, you know seeing something like that It's like oh you want, you know, everyone wants to have something all to themselves.

774
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:11,595
Rym: but then at the same time we have friends and I've met a lot of people in my life who who are good or bad have transcended that and are in open or Multi-faceted relationships.

775
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:18,620
Rym: and While many of them failed utterly at the same time many of them seem to be working very well.

776
00:51:18,964 --> 00:51:31,500
Scott: I guess it's just you know This is sort of a more general issue outside of the robots in that if you have a relationship with someone if it's a real Relationship then, you know the terms of that relationship, you know will be like agreed upon.

777
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:36,640
Scott: And if you're not able to agree on the terms of your relationship with someone then what kind of relationship is that?

778
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:41,300
Scott: That's not much going on there, you know, it's not really gonna work out if you can't even agree on something like that.

779
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:47,240
Scott: So if one person's, you know wanting something different than the other person then you're gonna end up hurting someone.

780
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:49,738
Scott: So don't make any promises that you're not gonna keep.

781
00:51:50,761 --> 00:52:03,740
Rym: Well, I think with this last question and we'll also probably end on that because we've gone on a while and I'm kind of hungry Okay, but I guess it also with this it comes down to are they using the robot as a dildo for the salsa?

782
00:52:04,261 --> 00:52:07,830
Rym: Or are they using the robot for the chips or both or both?

783
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:20,946
Rym: because if someone's using being jealous of the robot if Using it purely for the salsa is like being jealous of a vibrator if you're jealous of a vibrator That's a little bit sad.

784
00:52:20,986 --> 00:52:32,219
Scott: I think well, I mean, you know, you'd like, you know The chips of the salsa goes so well together that you'd like to think that you know The salsa that you made goes to the chips the best.

785
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:45,239
Rym: Well, I think there is an unrelated issue that a lot of people aren't very good at making salsa And a lot of people are very uncomfortable talking about it with possibly the people they also share chips with to the.

786
00:52:45,259 --> 00:52:54,320
Rym: I Love this analogy To the point that I think a lot of people could be having a lot better sex than they currently are and I'll leave it At that.

787
