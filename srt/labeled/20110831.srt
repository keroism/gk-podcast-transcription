1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,511
Rym: It's Wednesday, August 31st, 2011.

2
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:13,012
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:13,734
Scott: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:15,520
Rym: And this is GeekNights.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,740
Rym: Tonight, we review the last show to excite us in quite some time, Puella Magi Madoka Magica.

6
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,218
Scott: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,400
Rym: We're back from PAX.

8
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:35,140
Rym: You can tell that our voices are a little off, but not to like of the older days.

9
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,140
Rym: I feel like we've leveled up the voices.

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,215
Scott: Have we really?

11
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:42,030
Rym: It's not like that one Otakon.

12
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:43,180
Rym: we were coughing up blood.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,460
Rym: We couldn't even talk for like a day after the con.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,019
Scott: You were the one who was coughing up blood.

15
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:48,300
Rym: You couldn't talk either.

16
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,591
Scott: I was just uncomfortable to talk.

17
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:51,699
Scott: I could've talked if I needed to.

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,900
Rym: You could not talk because I know you.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,818
Rym: There were some discussions that were happening at the time.

20
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,310
Rym: where could you have said a word?

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,479
Rym: A word would have been said.

22
00:00:59,522 --> 00:00:59,798
Scott: A word.

23
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,151
Rym: A word it is.

24
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,318
Scott: So there was a real fire near my work.

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,068
Scott: It wasn't that exciting.

26
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:08,660
Scott: Some of those garbage stores that just sell shit to tourists.

27
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:10,220
Scott: You know those, right?

28
00:01:11,143 --> 00:01:13,100
Scott: They sell magnets for six bucks.

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,475
Rym: They basically sell garbage.

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,539
Scott: I love New York t-shirts and other trash, right?

31
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:18,500
Scott: A couple of them.

32
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:25,338
Scott: From the looks of the debris because I didn't see the fire happening I just walked past it and said, "Oh, a fire happened

33
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:25,520
Scott: here.".

34
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:32,699
Scott: It looked like they had some junky old Coca-Cola beverage refrigerator that had an electrical fire of some sort.

35
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,520
Rym: That's fine.

36
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:35,769
Rym: So PAX, right?

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,725
Rym: PAX is awesome.

38
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:38,860
Rym: We'll talk about it some other time.

39
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,319
Rym: So any of you who are new listeners from PAX, welcome, but tonight is anime night.

40
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:44,409
Rym: And comics.

41
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:45,160
Rym: All that stuff.

42
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,560
Rym: So if you're looking for our PAX coverage it'll probably be next Tuesday.

43
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:50,556
Scott: Mm-hmm.

44
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,000
Rym: I will gladly pay you on Tuesday.

45
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,638
Scott: For a PAX Sun.

46
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:59,019
Rym: Oh my god, the lucky thing is it's only six months till PAX.

47
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:00,377
Scott: Ah, thank god.

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,039
Scott: Hopefully there will be a third PAX and there will be even less time between PAXes.

49
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:08,979
Rym: So we're not going to talk about PAX tonight, but I do want to talk about the PAX-termath.

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:18,076
Rym: Because, you know, it's a weekend, I'm in Seattle, and we pretty much do nothing but eat incredibly dense, greasy, meaty food.

51
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:22,480
Scott: I kept it light by eating less meals but making all of them big.

52
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,160
Rym: Which is bad, because every time I go out to eat, all I would think, I'm like an animal.

53
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,985
Rym: I'm like, you know what?

54
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:32,320
Rym: I don't know when next there will be food in front of me, so I am going to gorge.

55
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:34,419
Scott: I didn't gorge, I thought I was full.

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,417
Scott: I didn't gorge.

57
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:41,658
Rym: But that was all well and good until we were going to the airport and we got to stand in security to get back on the plane to go back to New York.

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:42,877
Rym: Farted.

59
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,137
Rym: Kept farting.

60
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:46,500
Rym: They were silent.

61
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,760
Rym: To say that they were deadly was an understatement.

62
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,959
Rym: I think I killed eight people.

63
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,779
Scott: You were making jokes about who trailed the teams.

64
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,820
Rym: This is what I'm getting to, so we're in line, right?

65
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,319
Rym: And I fart.

66
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,640
Rym: And Emily just looks at me, and I look at her with the look of, yeah, it was me, and she starts laughing.

67
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,580
Rym: And then the people behind me walk into it, because the line was moving at quite a surprising pace.

68
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,020
Rym: It was just fast enough to where I think I maximized the number of people affected by my stinking cloud.

69
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:17,699
Rym: Maybe cloud kill at this point.

70
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,557
Scott: Cloud kill.

71
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:20,357
Rym: Coffee!

72
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,086
Rym: And I fart again.

73
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:23,580
Rym: We walk, and I fart again.

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,679
Rym: And I can hear people down the line making the noise of oof, they go like oof as they walked into it, like it hit them in the face.

75
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:36,580
Rym: So finally, I'm like, this is very reminiscent of the Trail of Tears.

76
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:40,198
Rym: And Emily lost it, and then everyone knew it was me.

77
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:47,899
Rym: I was very proud of that, and the worst thing is because I was thinking Trail of Tears, every time I farted, I started laughing.

78
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:49,658
Rym: It was like this vicious cycle.

79
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,738
Rym: So then we go to get on the plane, and as we're walking in, I turn to Emily, and I'm like, and now, the gas chamber.

80
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:00,799
Rym: That was the worst gas I've ever had.

81
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,503
Scott: Great.

82
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,831
Rym: So welcome to GeekNights, this is what we talk about.

83
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:04,278
Rym: Farts.

84
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:05,858
Scott: High class.

85
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:09,987
Scott: High class, high brow.

86
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:13,220
Rym: It's Wednesday, we got anime, we got manga, we got comics.

87
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:29,898
Scott: So, there's a new comic that came out somewhat recently, probably between the last Wednesday show and this one, that I saw on the ordering list, and I just wanted people to be aware that now, you can order this comic on the Amazon, as Jerry Holkin says.

88
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:35,819
Scott: And it will come and be delivered to your house, where you can read it for a very low price.

89
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,139
Scott: The comic is called Feynman.

90
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,708
Scott: It's a biography comic.

91
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:41,260
Rym: Surely you must be joking.

92
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:44,118
Scott: Richard Feynman, the famous person.

93
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,738
Scott: If you don't know who that is, what the fuck?

94
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,719
Scott: That's pretty much all there is to it.

95
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,559
Scott: Actually, you know, I saw that listed and I was like, okay, the premise on paper, that's awesome.

96
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:59,448
Scott: But in reality, I mean, is this really gonna be good?

97
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,640
Scott: You know, it could be terrible.

98
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:15,589
Scott: But, I was reassured because on the Amazon, there was a little video trailer for it, which had included music and showed you frames from the comic, and actually really sold me on it.

99
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:17,839
Scott: I was like, wow, not disappointed that I ordered that.

100
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:19,698
Scott: Didn't go wrong.

101
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,087
Rym: Alright.

102
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,507
Scott: Highly recommend.

103
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,479
Rym: Yeah, pretty much.

104
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,587
Rym: So, it was a Twitter thing, but it's comic related.

105
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:29,440
Rym: I'm gonna talk about this briefly because I just Googled it to figure out what the deal was.

106
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,269
Rym: I saw a bunch of people tweeting something about the blob.

107
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:34,199
Rym: ate the wasp.

108
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,698
Rym: And I'm like, what, you mean like?

109
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,336
Rym: nothing moves the blob?

110
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:39,320
Rym: And I guess the wasp is also a superhero.

111
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,960
Scott: Yeah, that could have been a Marvel Comics thing, right?

112
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:45,072
Rym: And it was people tweeting who know about comics.

113
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,487
Rym: I figured this is what they're tweeting about.

114
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:49,295
Rym: And then, one of them's like, yeah, Loeb something something.

115
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,647
Rym: I'm like, alright, this has got to be.

116
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,020
Scott: Jeff Loeb is a comic writer.

117
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,019
Rym: So, I was like, did the blob eat the wasp?

118
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,909
Rym: And who's the wasp?

119
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,780
Rym: I look up and the wasp.

120
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,489
Scott: The wasp is an Avenger.

121
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,159
Scott: She's very tiny.

122
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,245
Rym: And apparently, the blob ate her.

123
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:03,579
Scott: Alrighty.

124
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:06,184
Rym: And I Googled it and there it is.

125
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:12,770
Rym: Apparently famous as being one of the worst pages in any mainstream superhero comic ever.

126
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:15,220
Scott: Is she like still flying around inside of him?

127
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:18,677
Rym: No, he's like tearing her guts open and like eating her.

128
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:19,925
Rym: Yeah.

129
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:22,004
Scott: When did this happen?

130
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,924
Rym: There's another picture.

131
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:28,893
Rym: I don't know if this is canon or not, but it's Hank Pym eating the blob maybe in revenge.

132
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:30,145
Rym: I can't quite tell.

133
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:30,792
Rym: Yeah.

134
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:34,813
Rym: I don't know what the deal is, but I had to Google it because too many people were tweeting about it.

135
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,360
Rym: I was like, what?

136
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,004
Rym: Really?

137
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:37,079
Rym: The blob?

138
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:39,419
Rym: You know, all the moves him?

139
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,963
Scott: All the underwear perfect comics are just getting crazy.

140
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:42,367
Scott: Go nuts.

141
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:48,125
Scott: Lately going off the deep end, like the X men have like some kind of crazy schism thing going on.

142
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:51,297
Scott: We're like uncanny X men is actually going to be a final issue.

143
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:52,025
Scott: And then that's it.

144
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:52,875
Scott: Yeah.

145
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:54,165
Rym: That's it.

146
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,215
Rym: Just like how they all die.

147
00:06:55,316 --> 00:07:01,315
Scott: And it's like, yeah, no, but like they're not going to not going to be, you know, it's uncanny X men issue, whatever, 500 something.

148
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:03,800
Scott: And then there isn't going to be whatever.

149
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:05,153
Scott: that is plus one.

150
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,829
Scott: The unholy X men, right?

151
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,602
Scott: No, I mean, like, let's pretend the number is like 599.

152
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,823
Scott: There isn't going to be 600.

153
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:12,227
Scott: It's over.

154
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:13,924
Rym: That almost doesn't mean anything.

155
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:14,429
Scott: I know.

156
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,469
Scott: And then it does, if you're some crazy collecting, you know, nut job, like they sell to.

157
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:21,580
Scott: And there's going to basically the X men, they had a big fight.

158
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,680
Scott: It's like an X men fighting with themselves.

159
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,269
Scott: The Wolverine side and the Cyclops side.

160
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,067
Scott: It's like, well, Iceman's on the Wolverine side.

161
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:29,924
Scott: You know, it's that kind of bullshit.

162
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:30,369
Scott: It's like, OK.

163
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:30,712
Scott: Yeah.

164
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:31,440
Rym: Well, didn't they do that?

165
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,539
Rym: Like, didn't Captain America have some stuff like that?

166
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,609
Scott: That was the Avengers.

167
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:36,369
Scott: They're basically doing the same thing with the X.

168
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:38,894
Rym: Probably because that seemed to be pretty popular.

169
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:39,197
Rym: Yeah.

170
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:40,651
Scott: I don't know.

171
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:41,180
Scott: Whatever.

172
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,147
Scott: It's getting crazy.

173
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:48,429
Scott: But at least DC is doing the reset thing, which that might just be crazy and stupid, too.

174
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:50,618
Scott: But we'll check it out at the end of this month.

175
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:53,560
Scott: We're going to get a holding box of comments.

176
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:54,449
Rym: Yeah.

177
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:57,339
Rym: I'm looking forward to that.

178
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:58,188
Scott: We'll see.

179
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,300
Rym: I kind of am a little bit.

180
00:07:59,460 --> 00:07:59,864
Scott: A little bit.

181
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:03,600
Scott: Just to see its curiosity more than expectation of high quality.

182
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,540
Rym: I pretty much just want all the Batman's.

183
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:06,692
Rym: Yeah.

184
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:07,100
Rym: Batman.

185
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,086
Rym: Batman.

186
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:08,329
Rym: Batman.

187
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,734
Rym: Batman.

188
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,807
Rym: Well, I think it's Batman's is what I'm going to say from now on.

189
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:12,419
Rym: Batsmen.

190
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,823
Scott: That's so the first.

191
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:23,200
Scott: the first one of those number ones actually just came out this morning, I guess last night at midnight.

192
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:28,449
Scott: And the Jeff Johns, who I hate, and Jim Lee, who's all right, who did the Justice League.

193
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:32,004
Scott: They were at the Midtown Comics with a huge line of people and everything.

194
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:38,203
Rym: So so I do not have a news, nor do I have a geek bite, as is often my cop out.

195
00:08:38,972 --> 00:08:43,052
Rym: I'm going to do something that I don't think we've said this word on the show in over a year.

196
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:46,266
Rym: I have a geek back shit.

197
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:50,571
Rym: I got an email from 12 days ago from Jarvis.

198
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:52,044
Scott: What did Jarvis say?

199
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:52,669
Rym: Jarvis said.

200
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:58,709
Rym: And I bring this up partly because I've received many other emails on the same topic topic.

201
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:05,200
Rym: I don't remember saying anything about this show, but I must have because people wouldn't all be bothering us about this randomly.

202
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:10,104
Rym: So to quote Jarvis, I finished listening to the Anime We Want to See podcast.

203
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:12,285
Rym: I guess that's the one a few days ago.

204
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:19,072
Rym: I'm really hoping you guys come through with what you said about putting together a show on Gossa Rocky.

205
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:19,960
Scott: Oh, snap.

206
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,629
Rym: I'm not the biggest super fan of the show.

207
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:23,599
Rym: Who is?

208
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:26,607
Rym: But I did finish the whole thing.

209
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:27,092
Rym: Bravo.

210
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:27,578
Rym: Good, sir.

211
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:28,446
Rym: Good job.

212
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:32,345
Rym: You win maybe two years ago and it was well worth the time.

213
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,974
Rym: I even bought and built some of the model kits.

214
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:36,261
Rym: Whoa, man.

215
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:37,375
Rym: They're good models, actually.

216
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:37,760
Rym: Yeah.

217
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:39,982
Scott: I mean, if you get a big model stick with the Gundams do.

218
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:40,245
Scott: Yeah.

219
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:46,042
Scott: The band I put out maybe like battle textile as far out the farthest I'll go is maybe Matt Cross.

220
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:49,153
Rym: I'm not going to read the rest because he asks me a question.

221
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:50,264
Rym: that's kind of a spoiler.

222
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,912
Rym: And it's the kind of show where I don't want to spoil this.

223
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:53,438
Rym: Right.

224
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,364
Scott: But for people who don't know, there's an anime called Gossa Rocky.

225
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:57,759
Scott: It's your dog.

226
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:02,183
Rym: I like Gossa Rocky, but it is one of the more boring things you will ever see.

227
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:10,910
Scott: It's a really slow, boring like business and military show that has some fantasy and some robot.

228
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,334
Scott: Yeah.

229
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:18,466
Rym: The way I would describe Gossa Rocky is imagine a world where there are mechs but the mechs are literally just tanks.

230
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:23,110
Scott: Yeah, they work just like tanks only they happen to have legs.

231
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:30,044
Rym: Simultaneously, imagine an anime that treats the way tanks work the way tanks work.

232
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:38,147
Rym: And the people driving the tanks are talking the way that real people who are driving tanks are going to talk to each other and there's no time compression.

233
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,479
Scott: Or at least convincingly so.

234
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,640
Rym: Yeah, in the ineffect that it's just like move four clicks to the north.

235
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,508
Rym: Affirmative that.

236
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,947
Rym: Moving four clicks to the north.

237
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:46,272
Rym: Click.

238
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:46,720
Rym: Click.

239
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,187
Rym: We are engaging hostiles.

240
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:50,491
Rym: It's just.

241
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:52,735
Rym: it is so boring.

242
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:54,229
Rym: I cannot express this to you.

243
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:54,875
Scott: But I like it.

244
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:55,724
Scott: It's a good show.

245
00:10:55,784 --> 00:11:02,936
Rym: I really like it anyway because it's boring and procedural but it's a show that builds and builds.

246
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:07,199
Rym: Basically the entire show is set up for three scenes at the end of the show.

247
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:08,879
Scott: Yeah, pretty much.

248
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,704
Rym: And you'll know if you like this show.

249
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:20,491
Rym: I highly recommend at least watching it until something happens where a mech is hanging on a wire out the back of a plane shooting its stuff.

250
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:21,300
Scott: That was a great scene.

251
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:24,137
Rym: Or when a dude gets backed over by a jeep.

252
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:31,745
Rym: Those two scenes, if you notice those scenes and you enjoy them, you should watch the entire show.

253
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:40,190
Rym: Now it also has an ancient mystery and it also has the cliche that we've been talking about a lot lately because both Madoka and Trigun had this.

254
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:42,997
Rym: An episode that we like to call "Suddenly in

255
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:43,300
Rym: Space."

256
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:52,127
Rym: Meaning you turn on the episode, you know like somewhere in the middle of the show and you stop it a few minutes in because you think you've got the wrong show.

257
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,007
Rym: Like you opened the wrong file.

258
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:55,564
Rym: Maybe the DVD's messed up.

259
00:11:56,373 --> 00:12:05,358
Rym: Kind of like in "Innocence" where I was in the theater and I was convinced that the digital copy they were showing us was messed up and was looping.

260
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,279
Rym: And then I was like "Oh no, it's just

261
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,054
Rym: Oshii.".

262
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,040
Rym: Now, I keep saying boring.

263
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,714
Rym: You gotta trust me guys.

264
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,603
Rym: You might like this show.

265
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:14,753
Rym: It's super good.

266
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:15,440
Rym: Way good.

267
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:18,349
Rym: But, let's see what's a good example?

268
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:21,702
Scott: The thing is it's way good for the people who like it.

269
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:24,065
Scott: There's a lot of people who won't like it.

270
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:24,409
Scott: Most people.

271
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:28,900
Rym: Like if you like say "Skycrawlers" like the slow Oshii style.

272
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:39,945
Rym: you know, it's slow and boring because that's part of the message and you're cool with an hour and forty minutes of very little happening punctuated by action scenes, you're gonna dig this.

273
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:42,572
Rym: It's got a similar kind of message too.

274
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:43,663
Rym: It's even gotta be shown in it.

275
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:45,300
Scott: Remember him?

276
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:45,885
Scott: I guess.

277
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:46,269
Scott: Yeah.

278
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:47,966
Rym: He pretty much is.

279
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:49,260
Scott: He's got a good mystery.

280
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,329
Scott: We actually watched the show.

281
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,805
Scott: I bought the whole show on VHS.

282
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:53,439
Scott: We watched it all dubbed a long time ago.

283
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:55,865
Scott: We don't have VCRs anymore really.

284
00:12:55,885 --> 00:13:02,920
Rym: The dub averages out to a C but that's basically a B dub with one line that brought it down to a C average.

285
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,180
Rym: That's the worst line in any anime ever.

286
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:08,559
Scott: I bought the dub on VHS because it was cheaper in those days.

287
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,818
Scott: I didn't have a DVD player in those days.

288
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,826
Scott: Now you can get it on DVD probably cheap but I don't think it's in print anymore.

289
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:16,839
Scott: so you're gonna have to dig it up.

290
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,906
Rym: The main reason I say to watch it, I guess it's turned into a geek bite now.

291
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:21,360
Rym: I did a geek back that turned into a geek bite.

292
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,439
Rym: Like what happens here.

293
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,067
Scott: Double power.

294
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:28,429
Rym: We're really like it's anime season again so there's gonna be a lot of anime reviews coming down the pipe.

295
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:32,631
Rym: So I'm just gonna tell you right now to watch Gasaraki and then we'll watch it at some point soon.

296
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:34,611
Rym: We'll probably do a show or two on it.

297
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,500
Scott: Probably.

298
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:37,359
Rym: Because lately it's anime.

299
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,405
Rym: Maybe it's because PAX is done and all the games I want to play that I saw at PAX I cannot play yet.

300
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:48,119
Rym: So I'm gonna watch anime until Aramac and Monaco and Spy Party are in my house.

301
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,504
Rym: And then I'm pretty much gonna play those games.

302
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:52,172
Scott: Oh yeah.

303
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:52,759
Scott: Counter Strike Go.

304
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,525
Rym: Yup yup.

305
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:54,420
Scott: Tribes Ascend.

306
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,547
Rym: The best part is I traded a pretty crap ass board game for a box set.

307
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:01,949
Scott: You traded the number one board game on BoardGameGeek.

308
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,280
Rym: Yeah you know what the number one board game on BoardGameGeek kinda sucks.

309
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,090
Scott: For like 75, 80 bucks you paid for it.

310
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,888
Rym: That was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made was buying that game.

311
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:13,887
Scott: You realize the price of it now is like 100 plus.

312
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:14,917
Rym: Don't even care.

313
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,584
Rym: I just don't want it.

314
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,900
Scott: And you traded it for an anime.

315
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,968
Scott: you probably could have got used for a lot less.

316
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:22,613
Rym: I just wanted to get rid of Twilight Struggle.

317
00:14:22,674 --> 00:14:23,300
Rym: Fuck that game.

318
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Rym: And dude who got it from me you're gonna play it and you're gonna be like oh.

319
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:29,136
Scott: Maybe he'll like it.

320
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:29,967
Rym: I don't think so.

321
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:31,019
Scott: Apparently a lot of people do.

322
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,458
Rym: I know but who are these people?

323
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,071
Scott: It's not a good game.

324
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:34,459
Scott: Balls guys.

325
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,630
Rym: But anyway things of the day.

326
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:45,884
Rym: Usually Scott sees things like this before I do.

327
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,701
Rym: Somehow I saw this one first.

328
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:48,892
Scott: We really like it.

329
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:50,490
Scott: You were just having to read more internets today.

330
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:59,377
Rym: We really like it when people make stylized posters in an old style or a neat style about something that is not traditionally in that style.

331
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,176
Rym: I think the poster child for this is that awesome X-Men poster.

332
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:03,883
Scott: Yup.

333
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:08,755
Rym: So this is that and it's also kind of like those posters.

334
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,390
Scott: See the thing I don't understand right.

335
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,090
Scott: You always see this style of poster.

336
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,589
Scott: Why doesn't anyone use this style for like a video game or a whole movie or something like that.

337
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,058
Rym: Why don't we make turn flicked in this style.

338
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:21,686
Scott: Let's do it.

339
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:21,990
Scott: Done.

340
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:23,123
Scott: Done.

341
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:23,490
Scott: Yeah.

342
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:25,198
Scott: Good job.

343
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:26,570
Rym: Now we have to make turn flicked.

344
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:27,841
Scott: We're working on it.

345
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:29,986
Rym: I haven't worked on it in like three months.

346
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:30,673
Scott: That's alright.

347
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,512
Rym: In fact I still have it's.

348
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:38,633
Rym: on my desk is a piece of paper where I sketched out four maps and I wrote down the numbers for five kinds of units.

349
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:40,977
Rym: I have not even typed that into a computer yet.

350
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:41,584
Scott: Yeah it's fine.

351
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:48,188
Rym: Anyway so these are travel posters for historic planet Zeebs.

352
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,688
Scott: Let's travel to planet Zeebs.

353
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,497
Rym: They're pretty great.

354
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,490
Scott: What a great place to visit.

355
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,176
Scott: You know what.

356
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:53,662
Rym: You know what.

357
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,110
Scott: Tons of horrible creatures that want to rip your face off.

358
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,279
Rym: I point out this might be horrible acid everywhere.

359
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:06,713
Rym: Maybe this is from an era before the planet sucked because I mean the Chozo were there was kind of awesome wasn't it?

360
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,389
Scott: Oh did you want to go there when the Chozo were still there?

361
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:09,217
Rym: Or maybe.

362
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:10,633
Rym: Maybe like the Chozo fell.

363
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:13,238
Rym: Maybe it was nice for a while and then eventually it went to shit.

364
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,682
Rym: Maybe the space pirates made it go to shit.

365
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:19,062
Rym: Maybe after Sam has fixed everything it's nice again.

366
00:16:19,143 --> 00:16:19,528
Rym: We don't know.

367
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:23,590
Rym: I mean it was kind of empty when Sam has went back in Super Metroid.

368
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,878
Scott: Except for these space pirates living there.

369
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:27,826
Rym: Just space pirates.

370
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:29,842
Rym: There weren't that much else going on.

371
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:30,809
Scott: Metroids.

372
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,218
Scott: Horribly dangerous flora and fauna.

373
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:35,949
Rym: Not that bad.

374
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:41,688
Scott: It doesn't get much more dangerous in terms of the flora and fauna danger department.

375
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:49,134
Rym: I guess my perspective is skewed because every time I visited it has been through the most badass woman to have ever not lived.

376
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:52,309
Scott: You've never visited the West Indies.

377
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:55,649
Rym: You've never been to the West Indies.

378
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:59,943
Rym: Kids you win a point if you know what we're referencing there.

379
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:01,317
Rym: So what do you got for me Scott?

380
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,021
Scott: Why don't we do a show on the thing you were referencing on a Thursday?

381
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:05,903
Rym: We had to have done a show on that.

382
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:06,470
Scott: We'll check it.

383
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,863
Rym: I will check while you do your thing of the day.

384
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:08,510
Scott: You'll have to rewatch.

385
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,134
Scott: Don't you have it?

386
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,002
Rym: Yes.

387
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:13,680
Rym: I have two DVD box sets of the thing to which we referred a moment ago.

388
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,881
Scott: If you haven't done the show, let's watch an episode after the show is done.

389
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:18,285
Rym: Oh my god.

390
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:19,598
Rym: And then you want to drink some laudanum?

391
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:20,084
Rym: No.

392
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:20,650
Rym: You have a party?

393
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,564
Rym: Maudanum party?

394
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:21,748
Scott: No.

395
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,369
Scott: Thing of the day, right?

396
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:32,324
Scott: So for those of you who are aware Hatsune Miku was made using a technology known as Vocaloid 2.

397
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:36,544
Scott: And Hatsune Miku sounds pretty good depending on the person orchestrating her.

398
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:37,588
Scott: I guess would be the verb.

399
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:40,550
Rym: That sounds a little bit kinky.

400
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,587
Scott: Yeah, depending on how much...

401
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,894
Rym: Scott, we did a show on this on June 7th, 2007.

402
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:48,138
Scott: Shit.

403
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:49,334
Scott: Here's the news.

404
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:51,315
Rym: You did something from Fark.

405
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:51,820
Rym: I don't know what.

406
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,729
Rym: I'm going to click on it now.

407
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:53,332
Rym: Alright.

408
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:55,889
Rym: And I said that fidgeting is good for people.

409
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:58,470
Rym: Your thing of the day was the Jill Jet.

410
00:17:59,419 --> 00:17:59,708
Scott: Jill Jet.

411
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:05,788
Rym: And my thing of the day was Chairbot, which is basically hedonism bot the cosplay.

412
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,290
Scott: Alright, so what was my news from Fark?

413
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,008
Rym: Your news was something from the Daily Mail that no longer exists.

414
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:12,814
Rym: Great.

415
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:14,108
Rym: Nope, that's mine about fidgeting.

416
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:19,889
Rym: Yours was a man was in a wheelchair and got hit by a semi truck.

417
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:20,714
Scott: What?

418
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:21,628
Scott: That was your news.

419
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,411
Scott: What?

420
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:23,767
Scott: There had to be something more to it.

421
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:26,610
Scott: Hot to go listen to this episode.

422
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,197
Rym: I'm loading this old news article.

423
00:18:29,803 --> 00:18:32,910
Rym: Oh, a man was hit by a truck in his wheelchair.

424
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:35,461
Rym: It did not kill him or hurt him in any way.

425
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:42,169
Rym: The truck pushed him for two miles at over 50 miles an hour.

426
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,241
Rym: Okay, okay.

427
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:50,209
Scott: Alright, so Hatsune Miku has made a Vocaloid too.

428
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,688
Rym: You know what town this happened in?

429
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:52,860
Rym: Pawpaw.

430
00:18:54,767 --> 00:19:02,725
Scott: So, Hatsune Miku has made a Vocaloid too and depending on who, you know, if some amateur just opens up Hatsune Miku and tries to make her sing it sounds like a robot.

431
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:05,249
Scott: But if a professional does it and spends a lot of time on it.

432
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:08,141
Scott: it can often sound very close to a real person.

433
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:12,930
Scott: But even if you listen closely you can tell that it's not a real person.

434
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:16,649
Scott: At best, it's a person with extremely heavy autotune, right?

435
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:27,540
Scott: There has been a leaked audio file from someone who in Korea, they're working on a different company not Krypton Future Media who makes Hatsune Miku.

436
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:34,671
Scott: But this other company in Korea is making a new voice using Vocaloid 3.

437
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:35,599
Scott: Oh shit son.

438
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:43,377
Scott: And this leaked audio was put on the internets and it sounds like a person with a very light autotune.

439
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:44,629
Rym: The next step after this.

440
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,690
Scott: This is still in development, first of all.

441
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,842
Scott: And second of all, if that did they put the full effort of a professional into it?

442
00:19:51,863 --> 00:20:00,788
Scott: Like if the best Vocaloid users on earth use this, it's probably going to sound like a person with very very little autotunes on them.

443
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,910
Rym: Vocaloid 4 is one step away from Super Matt Cross.

444
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:11,961
Scott: Vocaloid 4 is probably going to be in the uncanny valley deep into it and Vocaloid 5 is probably going to sound like a real person.

445
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:14,105
Scott: So I predict, what year is it?

446
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:14,690
Scott: 2011? 2012?

447
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,651
Scott: So 2022?

448
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:17,339
Rym: What do you mean?

449
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:19,210
Rym: 2011? 2012?

450
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,291
Rym: Yeah.

451
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:19,900
Rym: What do you mean?

452
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,418
Rym: you have to estimate what year it is?

453
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:22,870
Scott: It's pretty close to 2012.

454
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,516
Rym: It's August!

455
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:39,522
Scott: Right, so in 2021 or 2028 you're probably going to have Vocaloid 5 and Vocaloid 5 is going to sound like a real person and you won't be able to tell.

456
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:41,769
Rym: Vocaloid 6 is going to take over the world.

457
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,769
Scott: Vocaloid 6, you won't have to even type anything in.

458
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,183
Scott: it'll just sing songs.

459
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:46,647
Scott: You turn it on.

460
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,224
Scott: But yeah this is pretty impressive.

461
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:51,254
Scott: You should listen to this.

462
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,009
Scott: This is not a person singing every last.

463
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:57,233
Scott: what was it?

464
00:20:57,516 --> 00:21:01,860
Scott: We will not have a vocal cord left in the singing of these internal machines.

465
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:08,426
Rym: So for a while now I've known about the show Puella Magi, Madoka, Magica you know, the weird title.

466
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:09,597
Rym: I always just called it Puella.

467
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:20,529
Scott: Yeah, well you know it's one of those situations where you're on the internets and you know sometimes there's like a thread that explodes about something and it's like you just notice it and you're like wow there's a pony thread over there.

468
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,235
Scott: I guess there's a thing called ponies and it's pretty popular.

469
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,306
Scott: Let me go see what the deal is.

470
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:30,627
Scott: So there was a Madoka Magica thread and I knew that there was a relatively new anime called Madoka Magica.

471
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:36,042
Scott: I didn't know anything else about it other than it was magical girly and it was getting and the people were talking about it.

472
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:36,748
Scott: so I was like yeah.

473
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,369
Rym: I had a little more going for me ahead of time because one, I knew it was done by Shaft.

474
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:41,178
Scott: All right.

475
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:43,969
Rym: You know they did Wreck which we also kind of liked.

476
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:48,450
Rym: And Arakawa under the Bridgie and Arakawa under the Bridgie-Bridgie.

477
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,400
Scott: You love the Bridgie-Bridgie.

478
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:50,290
Rym: I do love the Bridgie-Bridgie.

479
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:50,916
Rym: I don't know why.

480
00:21:51,259 --> 00:22:03,741
Rym: But also Nate had been telling me forever like from the moment it was out he was like this show is up your alley and the way he sold it to me was he was like it's Utena Eva with music by Yuki Kajira.

481
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:06,469
Scott: Yeah so I asked Emily, I was like what's the deal with that show?

482
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:06,913
Scott: and she's like.

483
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:11,640
Scott: it's like magical girls but it's serious and dark and I was like all right whatever.

484
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,609
Scott: so I started watching it.

485
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:16,669
Scott: you know people and I I realized what made me watch it.

486
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,330
Scott: you know people talked about it.

487
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,924
Scott: I needed a show to watch.

488
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:20,609
Scott: I checked it out.

489
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:22,306
Scott: it was only 12 episodes.

490
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,155
Scott: I'm like oh even if this is awful I can watch 12 episodes.

491
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:26,349
Rym: That's like two afternoons.

492
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,270
Scott: Right and I need to do a GeekNights show about something on a Wednesday.

493
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:37,075
Rym: Now it is very telling Scott that usually when there's a new show like this that isn't a million episodes you'll start watching it.

494
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:42,449
Rym: you'll say like hey I'm watching X and then like a month later you'll be like yeah I finished it you should watch it you should be doing a show on it.

495
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,176
Rym: You came to me like right away you're like watch this god damn show.

496
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:58,490
Scott: Yeah well as soon as I started watching it on a night and I watched five episodes and then the next day I watched seven and by noon I had watched the whole show because it's 12 episodes.

497
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,783
Rym: It's been a long time since Scott's been excited about an anime.

498
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:09,689
Rym: Never mind it's been a long time since I've been excited enough about anime to where I start watching it and I can't stop.

499
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,641
Scott: That happens sometimes.

500
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:17,408
Rym: I mean the last show that did that to me that wasn't My Little Pony was watching Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex.

501
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:19,764
Scott: So I did it somewhat recently.

502
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:20,369
Rym: Bocorato did it to me.

503
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:23,817
Rym: Eva, Eska, Trigun, Bebop.

504
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:25,701
Scott: And trying to think of times I couldn't stop.

505
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:28,430
Scott: I mean there'd be times like watching Okotenu Ken.

506
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:34,306
Scott: right so you just keep watching but there's a zillion episodes so you only watch like five at a time or something like that.

507
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:37,134
Scott: You know you don't just keep going and going without stopping because you can't.

508
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:37,578
Scott: You'll die.

509
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:42,446
Rym: Yeah but some shows like Bebop, if you've never seen it before you've just got to see the next episode.

510
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:46,710
Scott: Yeah even if you've seen Kawi Bebop before you start watching, you just can't stop watching.

511
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,609
Scott: You go straight to the end.

512
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,265
Scott: So what is Madoka Magica?

513
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:50,959
Scott: So here's the deal.

514
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:55,154
Scott: There's magical girls in the real world.

515
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:58,506
Scott: It's sort of actually a futuristic world right?

516
00:23:58,607 --> 00:23:59,497
Scott: It's like everything.

517
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:02,910
Rym: Yeah I think 20, 40 years into our future pretty realistically.

518
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,174
Scott: Everything is somewhat higher tech than the things we have in the world today.

519
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:07,942
Rym: I kind of like that.

520
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:08,589
Rym: It was a nice touch.

521
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,559
Rym: Yeah.

522
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:18,042
Scott: So you know this girl is in school and her name is Madoka and one day this transfer student shows up at the school.

523
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:20,849
Rym: Wow this is pretty stereotypical sounding so far isn't it?

524
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:23,860
Scott: She runs out of her house to go to school with a piece of toast in her mouth.

525
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,365
Rym: Oh my god.

526
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:25,739
Rym: but she finishes the toast.

527
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:26,790
Rym: I've never seen that happen.

528
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:27,799
Scott: Yeah she ate the whole toast.

529
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:32,567
Rym: Usually the toast is it causes like a gravitational field that causes a boy to be in front of her.

530
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:34,125
Rym: They'll bump into each other and it goes flying.

531
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:34,510
Scott: Right.

532
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,981
Scott: You know and it's typical.

533
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,165
Scott: you know at least on the surface level.

534
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:40,387
Scott: you know high school magical girl stuff.

535
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:56,245
Scott: but at the very beginning of the show the opening scene is that typical anime trick where they show you some crazy action scene of something else and then after the opener it's happy school and they somehow tie in that thing.

536
00:24:56,285 --> 00:25:01,721
Scott: that happened before the opener of the first episode is like a glimpse of the real plot later.

537
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:03,249
Rym: Well like remember When They Cry?

538
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:05,962
Scott: I didn't really watch it.

539
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:12,365
Rym: Before the credits it was the savage beating to death of someone with a baseball bat and then it was Moe School for like 23 minutes.

540
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:15,699
Scott: So it's you know.

541
00:25:16,144 --> 00:25:17,780
Scott: and that's the thing about Madoka I don't want.

542
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,910
Scott: you know it's only 12 episodes.

543
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,619
Scott: you can pretty much spoil the whole thing by saying anything.

544
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:22,448
Rym: Well but here's the deal.

545
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,387
Rym: so Madoka she's cute girl typical.

546
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:25,296
Rym: everything's stereotypical.

547
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:30,830
Rym: the transfer student all mysterious and badass and she takes her aside.

548
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:42,147
Rym: and actually Homura the transfer student has a lot of really good lines in this show like she has good delivery of things in it but she kind of takes Madoka aside.

549
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,070
Rym: she's like I need you to show me to the nurses office.

550
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:46,629
Rym: and she's like do you value your life?

551
00:25:46,872 --> 00:25:55,278
Rym: do you value the things in your life and she's like yes and then Homura's like well then you don't need to be anyone else do you?

552
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:55,829
Scott: Yeah.

553
00:25:57,153 --> 00:26:01,576
Scott: She's obviously from the start being like look you know that it's a magical girl show.

554
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:02,929
Scott: Madoka's name is in the show.

555
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:06,829
Scott: you see her as a magical girl in the opener which isn't anything like the show at all.

556
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:07,960
Scott: you know that.

557
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:08,364
Scott: you know.

558
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:18,225
Scott: you're thinking she's gonna become a magical girl and the first thing that happens is this mysterious girl who was magical in the opening before the opener.

559
00:26:18,347 --> 00:26:22,915
Scott: right who's now the transfer student is like don't become a magical girl.

560
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:28,470
Rym: pretty much yep especially because in the opener once like Madoka is clearly a magical girl.

561
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,628
Scott: so within the first couple minutes they've set up the conflict already.

562
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:35,684
Scott: Madoka had a dream about this magical girl.

563
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:42,488
Scott: the girl who looks just like the magical girl appears at school as a transfer student and it tells Madoka not to become a magical girl.

564
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:45,644
Scott: and pretty much you know she's the main character.

565
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:46,916
Scott: so she's got to become one.

566
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:55,741
Rym: and right after that I mean things conspire and there's this cute mascot Q-Bay who's kind of like Luna and Dung Beetle and all those cute things kind of mixed together into one.

567
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:57,803
Scott: yeah he's the same thing as Dung Beetle from Bocorano.

568
00:26:57,823 --> 00:27:00,166
Scott: basically he's the alien who tries to.

569
00:27:00,226 --> 00:27:01,984
Scott: you know has it's like?

570
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:03,560
Scott: there's all these different sorts of.

571
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:07,541
Scott: you know Madoka's combined all these different things right.

572
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:12,529
Scott: a lot of the show has the mood of Eva right where you know you'll have shots of.

573
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:18,858
Scott: you know weird things or like shots where the characters are off camera while sort of an eerie music plays and people talk.

574
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:25,441
Scott: or you know a quiet scene of an empty street with cicadas chirping right a lot of the Eva kind of stuff and the same.

575
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,706
Scott: and that's the mood you'll have through a lot of the show.

576
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:34,610
Rym: but like the backgrounds and the like the stark silhouette landscapes are so utenna it's ridiculous.

577
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:46,970
Scott: yeah also you'll have you know how Battle Royale or Bocorano or a lot of those or Nine People Nine Doors Nine Hours whatever Death Note, Monster even Death Note, Monster not really.

578
00:27:47,574 --> 00:27:54,518
Scott: but you know all these shows that have a premise where all the conflict Bocorano centers around a set of rules like they set up.

579
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,194
Scott: you know in some sci-fi or fantasy reason for a set of rules like these are the rules of the Death Note.

580
00:28:00,215 --> 00:28:07,305
Scott: this is the rules of the Battle Royale while Madoka there's these set of rules about magical girls that are set up that create conflict because

581
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:17,549
Rym: if you pull back a little bit there aren't that many rules that come into play in this show and they're very rarely stated as like in Death Note like rule number eight blah blah blah.

582
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:20,597
Scott: they're not stated so strictly like they are in the other rules shows.

583
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:32,254
Rym: it's more that the mystery of the show is what the rules are or like in Monster the mystery is kind of like what is the monster after and what made him and why is he doing this to all those kids?

584
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,335
Scott: yeah and also right the show also has the Trigun going on.

585
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:42,175
Scott: if you don't if you've never seen Trigun I'm not going to spoil that either but it's also a Gasaraki same show does the same thing we call it now.

586
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:45,448
Rym: I think Scott coined the term suddenly in space right.

587
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:52,096
Scott: so in Trigun episode 17 I'm not going to tell you what happens but basically suddenly right.

588
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:52,741
Scott: the episode 16 ends.

589
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:56,579
Scott: episode 17 does not pick up where 16 left off.

590
00:28:57,551 --> 00:29:03,650
Scott: in fact you might think did I put in the wrong DVD right because it doesn't look like Trigun even though you just saw a Trigun opener?

591
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,730
Rym: uh Gasaraki did the same thing episode.

592
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:08,890
Rym: I think it's 12 or 13. it's like what this isn't Gasaraki?

593
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:10,542
Rym: did they fuck up.

594
00:29:10,744 --> 00:29:12,036
Scott: but it is you know they.

595
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:14,803
Scott: just suddenly there's an episode at the very beginning of the episode.

596
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:17,149
Scott: you're in the past and you're seeing.

597
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:24,016
Scott: you're basically having the secrets of the show answered for you and episode 10 out of 12 of Madoka is just like that.

598
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:32,722
Scott: it doesn't pick up where 9 left off it just starts at some other point in some other place and teaches you all the secrets of the show and blows your brains out.

599
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:41,671
Rym: now very rarely if I had an episode of it I've had shows that have oh shit moments where like oh shit Akio something oh shit you know some sort of like.

600
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:46,036
Scott: yeah but the thing is those more typically right come towards the end of an episode.

601
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:53,128
Scott: it's like an episode will pick up where the last one went off build up and then something crazy will happen at some sort of climax.

602
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:56,219
Rym: more importantly there will only be one oh shit in an episode.

603
00:29:56,259 --> 00:30:02,077
Scott: right it's a totally different technique to start an episode like what is going on oh shit.

604
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:04,483
Scott: and then the whole episode is like crazy.

605
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:11,070
Scott: and the thing is Scott hyped it up because he watched the show and I was like I hyped it up because I couldn't help myself but then I was like Rym did I overhype it?

606
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:11,857
Rym: oh my god.

607
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:25,755
Rym: so literally 5 seconds into that episode 10 all of us are like oh shit and then we oh shit again and then again and again and it like and as soon as I'm like okay I see what's going on.

608
00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:30,018
Rym: there was another oh shit that just blew everything out of the water like.

609
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,430
Rym: I cannot express to you it was a similar feeling.

610
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:45,380
Rym: the last time an anime made me feel that way was that one episode of Utena with the the car and Anthony holding the candles and they're going out one by one and then you see somebody in the background.

611
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:49,756
Rym: that was the last time I had even close to that.

612
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:52,260
Rym: much oh shit in an episode of an anime.

613
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,987
Scott: I don't know.

614
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:57,110
Scott: I've had that a bunch of times but it hasn't been in a while because it hasn't been a good show in a while.

615
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:02,340
Scott: and I think the thing about this show I think the key is that it's 12 episodes right.

616
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:06,927
Scott: so every episode is the episode where X happens.

617
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:08,401
Scott: you know each episode is big.

618
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,038
Scott: there's no meaningless episodes.

619
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,372
Scott: there's no slow parts there's.

620
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:11,655
Scott: no.

621
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,310
Scott: you know everything that happens.

622
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:18,826
Scott: you know it's very economical with its scenes and everything is meaningful.

623
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:23,250
Scott: you're always in the heat of it and then before it drags on it ends.

624
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:25,350
Scott: it's like Gonzo shows.

625
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:27,474
Scott: if all the Gonzo shows like say Last Exile.

626
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:34,281
Scott: Last Exile started just about as strong as Madoka started but it had 26 episodes and it sort of dragged a bit.

627
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:37,797
Scott: I'm watching number 6 right now started pretty strong but dragged.

628
00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:39,798
Scott: Eden of the East so I don't know.

629
00:31:39,838 --> 00:31:42,261
Scott: I don't think that was as long but it you know it still.

630
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:43,474
Rym: it wasn't that it dragged.

631
00:31:43,514 --> 00:31:48,310
Scott: is that it introduced characters I didn't care about right and or know why they were there or anything.

632
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:52,098
Scott: but you know Madoka perfect 12 episodes.

633
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:52,785
Scott: we're ending it.

634
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:53,876
Scott: period done.

635
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:58,404
Rym: also it's very important to note that Madoka has a real ending.

636
00:31:58,424 --> 00:32:02,950
Scott: yeah it's not like say shows like scrap princess.

637
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,866
Rym: lets reveal the whole plot at the end out of nowhere.

638
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:10,584
Rym: or let's see Bokerano has a real ending too or a candidate for goddess.

639
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:12,727
Scott: right that show was one that was clearly was.

640
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:22,586
Scott: they were intending to go more than 13 episodes but they got cut to 13 and you could see the 13th episode was sort of like oh shit we weren't planning to end it right now but we have to.

641
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:32,728
Scott: so like Eden of the East had a stupid ending yeah but Madoka they knew they were going to end it at 12 episodes well in advance and they did so.

642
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:36,626
Scott: so they brought it to the ending with the exact right pacing.

643
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,747
Scott: it wasn't rushed it wasn't slow it was perfect.

644
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:42,505
Rym: and the thing is the show like as you're going on and more oh shits are happening.

645
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:46,403
Rym: you're like you're learning things about this universe like what is a magical girl?

646
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:48,080
Rym: what is Cubase contract?

647
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,454
Rym: what does all this really mean?

648
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:50,484
Rym: who is Homura?

649
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,200
Rym: why is she the way she is?

650
00:32:52,342 --> 00:32:53,210
Rym: how does she know all this?

651
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,784
Scott: why is everyone the way they are?

652
00:32:54,804 --> 00:33:08,730
Rym: and it gets to a point around episode 8 8 and a half where there is no conclusion you can make but that everybody's fucked in a way that is almost unimaginably depressing.

653
00:33:09,274 --> 00:33:17,817
Rym: yeah like as an intelligent person you're like there is no way out of this and the way the show ends is pretty fantastic.

654
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:18,463
Scott: yeah it's pretty.

655
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:19,857
Scott: it's one of those you know.

656
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:23,594
Scott: sometimes you'll be watching something and you'll be like just do this.

657
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,929
Rym: just do this Scott it's we have to call this the guns moment when Neo is like guns.

658
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:40,060
Scott: exactly you're like just do this and then you get really happy because in the show they actually end up doing something pretty similar to what you were hoping someone would do right.

659
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:45,110
Scott: yeah like I was thinking the whole time just do this and in the end they did something sort of close.

660
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:48,202
Rym: they kind of was beyond what I thought I would be like.

661
00:33:48,222 --> 00:33:49,618
Rym: do X. they were like do X times 10.

662
00:33:49,618 --> 00:33:55,475
Scott: yeah it definitely was not exactly what I was thinking but it worked out you know in the same sort of way.

663
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:04,301
Rym: it's also very worth mentioning that the show has fantastic music but it has a very limited repertoire of songs that are used almost like leitmotifs.

664
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:06,222
Rym: there's like the action.

665
00:34:06,282 --> 00:34:07,010
Rym: stuff is happening.

666
00:34:07,192 --> 00:34:07,636
Rym: song.

667
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:11,637
Rym: there is the variation on that for you're learning stuff about the universe.

668
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,377
Rym: there is the ominous.

669
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:15,719
Rym: you're learning stuff about the universe or is more questions.

670
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:15,981
Rym: song.

671
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:17,556
Rym: there is the happy.

672
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:18,647
Rym: we are doing stuff.

673
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:18,969
Rym: song.

674
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:23,981
Scott: well actually if you pay attention right there's pretty much each of the girls has.

675
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:27,255
Scott: everyone has a theme song Scott that's called a leitmotif character.

676
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:32,284
Scott: right it's a leitmotif but most of the other songs are just variations of the opener or the closer.

677
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,121
Scott: and the opener and the closer are great like.

678
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,880
Scott: they're super awesome.

679
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Rym: they're reminiscent of good old anime.

680
00:34:37,962 --> 00:34:42,346
Rym: yeah actually the opener song really reminds me of the song from the remake of bird of the mighty.

681
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:44,668
Scott: yeah the thing about the opener is like.

682
00:34:44,688 --> 00:34:48,750
Scott: I don't know if it's the greatest song but I really like it and it gives me sort of this nostalgic feeling.

683
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:50,549
Scott: it feels like an older anime song.

684
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:51,275
Rym: well what's funny?

685
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:54,309
Scott: because you know it brings me back to like the 90s we're hanging out with.

686
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:55,318
Rym: and it's funny.

687
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:02,690
Rym: Scott has seen all of Madoka twice and I've seen it 1.7 times because our friend Nuri came.

688
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:15,055
Rym: we showed a bunch of our friends the first three episodes and she just stuck around instead of going home the next day to watch all the rest of the show up to episode 9. so me her and Emily could then finish it and then you know she couldn't.

689
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:17,742
Rym: she got to 9. she's like oh shit I can't watch more can I?

690
00:35:17,763 --> 00:35:18,349
Rym: and I'm like hells.

691
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:18,976
Rym: no you can't.

692
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,290
Scott: well you could've just.

693
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,661
Rym: no no no she couldn't.

694
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:23,558
Rym: so she was like.

695
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,509
Rym: well what do I watch now?

696
00:35:25,192 --> 00:35:26,270
Rym: something less hardcore.

697
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,409
Rym: so I was like mahotsukaita.

698
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:38,290
Rym: but seriously this is the first time in history I have seen a show with music by Yuki Kajira where the show wasn't shit.

699
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:42,910
Scott: yeah I mean she's done actually in my opinion the hak-san music and the noir music.

700
00:35:43,052 --> 00:35:45,703
Scott: I like those musics actually better than the Madoka music.

701
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:47,849
Scott: not that the Madoka music is that much worse.

702
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:51,770
Scott: it's a step under mostly because there's less of it.

703
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:58,390
Rym: those were longer shows with arguably more complex plots though not better plots.

704
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,423
Rym: like there's more stuff going on.

705
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:09,379
Scott: and also it's just that I tend to judge music not based on any sort of measure of musical quality because I don't know anything about music or music theory.

706
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:17,349
Scott: but it's like I like a song more if it gets stuck in my head even though you usually get annoyed when a song gets stuck in your head.

707
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,470
Rym: I had the closing song to Madoka stuck in my head.

708
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,570
Scott: the opening and closings of Madoka definitely had head stickage.

709
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:29,296
Rym: but the other songs I had Mami's "I am awesome and happy doing awesome stuff" song.

710
00:36:29,316 --> 00:36:30,670
Scott: that's definitely the third best song.

711
00:36:31,117 --> 00:36:35,768
Scott: but the other music I can't really recall it.

712
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:36,518
Rym: think about "Head Sign".

713
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:48,970
Rym: the only songs you remember are the "Key of the Twilight" song that opening the world song yup and maybe the "Ara" song which is the sad girl singing about sad people.

714
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,715
Scott: I remember songs.

715
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:59,129
Scott: not only do I remember the opening and closing songs but also multiples of the non opening and closing songs.

716
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:04,550
Rym: granted Scott you were the one who with a straight face said that Giant Robo's music was uninspired and unmemorable.

717
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,530
Scott: I don't remember a single song from Giant Robo.

718
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:08,990
Rym: I think Giant Robo had one of the stronger anime soundtracks.

719
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:10,889
Scott: I don't remember a single song from it at all.

720
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:21,670
Scott: if you played me the Giant Robo soundtrack and another similar soundtrack I probably would just be one out of two guesses to figure out which one's Giant Robo and which one's not.

721
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:22,530
Rym: so here's the deal.

722
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:25,848
Rym: back in the day, "Head Sign" the first episode.

723
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:30,068
Rym: that in of itself I was like this is some A material right here.

724
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:34,512
Scott: like it had everything cool but then nothing happened between episodes 5 and 13.

725
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:35,650
Rym: ah but pretend those didn't exist.

726
00:37:35,913 --> 00:37:39,350
Rym: it had the awesome Yuki Kajiro music and the awesome hook.

727
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:46,910
Rym: that music alone tricked me into watching that show all the way to episode 13 before I realized it was shit and nothing else had happened.

728
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:59,370
Rym: same thing with "Head Sign" and "Noir" which was almost as bad as "Head Sign" just because the music made me think and the first episode combined made me think.

729
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,790
Scott: I think "Noir" was better than "Head Sign".

730
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:03,950
Rym: it was, but it was still bad, I got to the end and I regretted watching it.

731
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,368
Scott: yeah the later parts of the show really jumped off the shark.

732
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:08,069
Rym: there I mean the first episode had.

733
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:14,290
Scott: it was a guy jumping off a cliff and as he fell down the cliff he passed by a bunch of sharks also falling off the cliff.

734
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:15,115
Rym: but how come?

735
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:22,650
Rym: that's the same show that had the Yuki Kajiro music and it had the dude strangled with his own tie silhouetted off of a staircase.

736
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:28,269
Rym: yeah, everyone remembers that scene in that show is just like the guy hitting the propeller in "Titanic".

737
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:28,965
Scott: oh shit.

738
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:37,829
Rym: so you've got that high quality really intense Yuki Kajiro music in a good show.

739
00:38:38,581 --> 00:38:40,329
Rym: the show is good and the music is good.

740
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:43,189
Scott: yup what else is good about the show?

741
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,870
Scott: the animation is actually just pretty normal modern animation, but there's some things about it.

742
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:51,768
Scott: number one is the magical girls fight.

743
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:54,190
Scott: bad guys these witches, obviously the magical girls.

744
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,205
Scott: they're gonna fight something.

745
00:38:55,731 --> 00:39:01,310
Scott: the witches are some EVA pop art material so the witches are all in these reality spheres.

746
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:14,090
Scott: this isn't a spoiler whatever you want to call it, but basically whenever they fight the witches they sort of go to this other world to fight them and the other world has this crazy art style that's different for every witch and is nothing like anime style.

747
00:39:14,131 --> 00:39:22,930
Rym: so you see the anime characters one of the witches they fight pretty early on is basically a Murakami super flat worm dragon unicorn bot.

748
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:25,266
Scott: so it's really awesome.

749
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:29,730
Scott: just to see what kind of crazy art is gonna be going on in the witches' reality marvel.

750
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,869
Rym: you'll never see mustaches so sinister ever again.

751
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:44,030
Scott: it's crazy awesome, I love it whenever a witch comes, it's like a feast for the eyes to see what's going on with all the details in the background and all the other weird characters coming out.

752
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,126
Rym: it's also a minor point, but the show is really colorful and it has.

753
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:50,910
Scott: sometimes it's really colorful and sometimes it's not.

754
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:56,083
Rym: but it has really cute young characters, but they're not moe, there's like no fan service at all, zero.

755
00:39:56,912 --> 00:40:02,770
Scott: it's like the characters could be if you use them easily moe perverted characters.

756
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:08,129
Scott: but there's never any up skirts or boob shots, you know, the opener has a second of it.

757
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:13,090
Rym: I don't want to talk about things to say about the opener that are kind of spoilers.

758
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:15,130
Scott: yeah, the opener is nothing like the show.

759
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:24,422
Scott: that's all you gotta know, but the thing is there's never any fan service or any porn or anything like that in the show ever, right?

760
00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:30,390
Scott: They're just magical girls, their magical girl costumes are not revealing or porny at all you know, it's just straight up.

761
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,830
Rym: but also they never go super deformed.

762
00:40:32,971 --> 00:40:36,950
Rym: it doesn't really do any wacky anime stuff, it's actually a very tight and crisp looking show.

763
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:54,008
Scott: the only thing though is that sometimes they do this trick where they're drawn in a very digital clean modern way but their faces will sort of be sort of sketchy and pastel colored pencil manga-ish, so it's like you have a completely normal character, but like their eyes will be sort of scratchy.

764
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,949
Rym: I really like the eyes, all the eyes almost look like they're out of a colored manga.

765
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:02,369
Rym: it's neat, the eyes stood out and I really like that style of eye.

766
00:41:02,472 --> 00:41:03,007
Scott: it's pretty clever.

767
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:05,601
Rym: so who should watch the show?

768
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:12,450
Rym: I'm gonna tell you straight up it's very rare, it's been a long time since I have unhesitatingly called a show an A anime.

769
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:16,061
Scott: the thing is, I also call it an A anime but I don't call it an A+ anime.

770
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:26,530
Rym: well A+ is different, A+ has the combination of universal appeal brilliant both from like the fanboy perspective and from the like, just art perspective.

771
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:38,208
Rym: yeah, it's not Kawaii Bebop, it's not a Miyazaki movie, it's not Matt Cross TV, you know but it holds its own next to Escaflowne, next to Trigun, it pumped me up similarly to the way Kawaii Bebop pumped me up.

772
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:41,630
Scott: I call it Exactly Equal with Big O which is great.

773
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:47,049
Scott: it's Exactly Equal with Big O which also had 13 episodes in its first season.

774
00:41:47,995 --> 00:42:01,350
Scott: it did, but I've actually heard a rumor of a Madoka's second season not really a second season but a you know, another show where you take the characters and it's just happy school time the whole time.

775
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,889
Rym: I know leave it alone, you know what that would be like?

776
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,590
Rym: that would be like if you had Cowgirl Ed and Ayn's adventures.

777
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:10,789
Scott: well, didn't we want that?

778
00:42:11,552 --> 00:42:13,670
Rym: no, I wanted that, but I didn't really want it.

779
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:24,870
Scott: right, exactly, I think it's one of those situations where because it was 12 episodes right, you know, usually most of these shows follow a path where it's happy school time and then later on the darkness.

780
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:27,830
Scott: this show is the darkness from before.

781
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:30,150
Scott: in the first one second is the darkness.

782
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:32,553
Rym: it's like episode 1, you really want to be a magical girl?

783
00:42:32,614 --> 00:42:38,590
Rym: episode 2, here's what it's really like, episode 3, off the deep end and you still got a bunch more episodes.

784
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,075
Scott: 9, 9 episodes.

785
00:42:42,735 --> 00:42:43,019
Rym: but

786
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:59,529
Scott: other shows start off with a lot more school a lot more getting to know the characters a lot more side characters that are humorous that fade away and aren't in the show later on stuff like that, and this show didn't have any of that because it only had 12 episodes and I think because it was popular they want to go back to

787
00:42:59,549 --> 00:42:59,590
Rym: it.

788
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:15,049
Rym: yet it lulls you into a sense of complacency because after alright, it's magical girls, let's go you really expect them to be just fighting witches and it presents itself like alright, they're going to fight this witch and then no that's not what happens.

789
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,509
Scott: you don't know what's going to happen, it's crazy awesome.

790
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:19,670
Rym: so who should watch the show?

791
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:26,908
Scott: like we said, everyone, the reason I say you've never watched an anime in your life ever, and you're not a big if you're a big nerd.

792
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,290
Scott: you've never watched an anime before.

793
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:37,834
Scott: this might actually be a good thing to watch because if I had watched this when I was in high school since I was a nerd, I would have been blown away by it.

794
00:43:37,854 --> 00:43:42,950
Rym: Yeah, when I was in fourth grade and I saw Vampire Hunter D and I was blown away by it this would have blown me away the same way

795
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:47,693
Scott: but I might not have fully understood it and would have had to come back later with more anime knowledge much

796
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:49,310
Rym: like when I saw the first Tenchi movie.

797
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:50,663
Rym: I had no idea what was going on.

798
00:43:50,683 --> 00:43:53,007
Scott: Clearly if you're already an anime fan, just watch it.

799
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:57,710
Scott: even if you don't like it, it's only 12 episodes, just do it right?

800
00:43:59,432 --> 00:44:06,563
Scott: and you know, the only people who really shouldn't, probably should avoid it, are people who aren't anime fans yet and also aren't nerds.

801
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:15,050
Scott: They need to come into anime, you know, like the Kaveh Bebop Road and the Miyazaki Road Unless they're one of those people who remembers like, "Oh, as a kid I watched Sailor Moon".

802
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:17,270
Rym: you just tell them, "This is Sailor Moon for grown-ups".

803
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:19,310
Scott: Maybe, it might work, it might not.

804
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:25,410
Rym: I think it would work, because the show doesn't have all that build-up, it gets right into the thick of it, so you're pretty much.

805
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:34,296
Rym: it only takes a few minutes to get hooked in and I can't think of many people who, once they start watching it would at least not want to know what happens.

806
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:38,278
Scott: I've also seen so I've seen some people on the internet complaining they don't like the ending.

807
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:38,762
Scott: You're wrong.

808
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:39,610
Scott: They can all shut up.

809
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,530
Scott: They're probably the same people who don't like Eva.

810
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:44,863
Rym: Well, they hate this ending for the same reasons.

811
00:44:44,903 --> 00:44:47,410
Rym: they hate the Eva ending, even though the endings are actually very different.

812
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:49,834
Scott: Yeah, but it doesn't matter, the point is all those people suck.

813
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:54,139
Rym: Yeah, you're seriously, if you're not satisfied with the end of the show suck it.

814
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:54,709
Rym: Get out of here.

815
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:59,900
Scott: Uh, there's something else, but whatever There's a lot else.

816
00:44:59,981 --> 00:45:06,389
Rym: When we watched the show you know, saw the end and some shows, like I say, finish the show, and then I just turn it off.

817
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:14,409
Rym: but some shows, the credits just play all the way to the end and everyone sits in the room quiet until there is literally no more to see.

818
00:45:14,591 --> 00:45:19,335
Scott: And then, oh, there's something after the final credits like 20 seconds worth, so you should watch that.

819
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:21,801
Rym: But, you know, you can tell when the show is an A anime.

820
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:24,649
Rym: I think my definition of an A anime, it makes that list.

821
00:45:25,235 --> 00:45:32,225
Rym: if the majority of the people you show it to, when it ends, will sit in the room quietly until the last of the credits are gone.

822
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:33,094
Scott: That's one factor.

823
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:40,890
Scott: The other factors are you watch an episode and you just want to keep watching and you can't help yourself, and B, re-watching is good.

824
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:46,246
Scott: Like, if you can actually re-watch it and enjoy it again, if you get all those three things, it's an A anime.

825
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:48,062
Rym: Yes, and it does the Utena thing.

826
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:48,849
Rym: You watch it again.

827
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:51,189
Rym: everything you needed to know was there.

828
00:45:51,912 --> 00:46:00,426
Scott: Yeah, it's like you watch the first episode after knowing the ending and people say things and you're like putting your hand over your mouth like, "Oh my god, they said that in episode one, I can't

829
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,730
Scott: believe!".

830
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:06,501
Rym: Hell, you watch this, every single episode has moments of, "Oh shit, oh really?

831
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:08,001
Rym: Oh, why didn't I notice that

832
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:08,588
Rym: before?".

833
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:09,416
Scott: "I can't believe.

834
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:11,515
Scott: they said that so early and I didn't notice

835
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:11,576
Scott: it.".

836
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:14,427
Scott: And there's only 12 episodes and they fit it all in.

837
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:18,043
Rym: This is one of the best anime I've seen in a long time.

838
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:18,610
Scott: Yeah, best.

839
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:20,850
Scott: I definitely call it best recent anime.

840
00:46:21,714 --> 00:46:27,249
Rym: The last show that was as good as this that I watched was re-watching 2nd Gig Ghost in the Shell.

841
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:30,150
Scott: One more note just historically on the show, right?

842
00:46:30,992 --> 00:46:34,350
Scott: The final episode of the show was delayed by the real earthquake.

843
00:46:34,653 --> 00:46:36,409
Rym: Oh my god, I couldn't have dealt with that.

844
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:41,050
Scott: And then it came out in Japan much later and still got crazy ratings.

845
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:45,515
Rym: Well think about it, Scott, imagine if you had seen up to episode 11 and then you had to wait.

846
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:46,161
Rym: Yeah.

847
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:49,333
Rym: You would have been waiting as badly as we're waiting for the second season of Ponies.

848
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:54,570
Scott: That's why I don't wait, I just download the whole show at once and watch it all at once in one afternoon and one morning.

849
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:02,992
Rym: This has been GeekNights with Rym and Scott.

850
00:47:03,032 --> 00:47:08,000
Rym: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

851
00:47:08,404 --> 00:47:13,419
Scott: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

Rym: Remember, GeekNights is not one, but four different shows.
