00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,186
Rym: It's Thursday, June 17th.

2
00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:12,048
Rym: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:13,211
Scott: I'm Scott and tonight.

4
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:16,300
Rym: We conclude the book club for Carl Sagan's cosmos.

5
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,226
Scott: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:29,779
Rym: So I realize what needs to happen with the fucking vuvuzelas.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,386
Rym: It's vuvuzela at the end.

8
00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:37,863
Rym: It's a schwa not in it not like an air and I'll pronounce it However the fuck you want.

9
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:39,327
Scott: I don't care or lepata.

10
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:43,058
Scott: Ta you know what the best pronunciation of it is shut the fuck up.

11
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:47,659
Scott: no That's how you pronounce that shit.

12
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:51,529
Rym: So I thought before I was thinking what can we do?

13
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:56,685
Rym: because right now the vuvuzela is the thing like every Everyone in the planet.

14
00:00:57,127 --> 00:01:00,479
Rym: if do you really have to crinkle that bag while we're doing the show?

15
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,749
Scott: captain I was investigating my M&Ms.

16
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:04,477
Rym: Yeah, you got some fancy M&Ms.

17
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:05,040
Rym: I see there.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,923
Scott: Well, they're not fancy.

19
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:10,980
Scott: Some of them have pretzel in them and some of them are dark chocolate and also peanut at the same time.

20
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:15,660
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if the dark chocolate M&M is gonna be the best dark chocolate.

21
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:17,185
Scott: It's you can tell.

22
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:21,840
Scott: you can tell but it's not much different from the milk chocolate darker.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,692
Scott: Yeah, it's like oh that was slightly dark chocolate.

24
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,216
Scott: Okay, great.

25
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:30,126
Rym: I'll be honest I never liked M&Ms.

26
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:31,089
Rym: what?

27
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:31,932
Rym: even as a little kid.

28
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:33,176
Rym: Will you stop the head?

29
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:34,500
Rym: I never liked him.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,764
Rym: I liked peanut M&Ms and like Reese's Pieces Fuck M&Ms.

31
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:42,196
Scott: Well, these are peanut dark chocolate and also pretzel.

32
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:42,819
Rym: So that's okay.

33
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,420
Rym: pretzel I don't know about because that that just brings me back to combos, which I also hated.

34
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:48,260
Scott: Oh combos are just so disgusting.

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,285
Rym: But the thing I never understood.

36
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:52,580
Rym: all my dumbass friends would have like a gigantic bag of those things.

37
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:54,988
Rym: Them and bugles in their life every day.

38
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,633
Scott: the thing I don't like about those.

39
00:01:56,693 --> 00:01:57,837
Scott: I mean the combo.

40
00:01:57,857 --> 00:01:58,820
Scott: I like the pretzel part.

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,198
Scott: I just don't like the fake cheese part, but the same with the bugle the worst pretzel.

42
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:04,644
Rym: It was nuts It was butts.

43
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,552
Scott: No, but I mean, you know, the.

44
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:08,460
Scott: the idea of pretzel is not a problem.

45
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:13,360
Rym: Yeah, but the idea of shitty pretzel is a problem let alone shitty pretzel with fake cheese.

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,404
Scott: Yeah, they should have had.

47
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:20,246
Scott: they should make a combo where the inside is not fake cheese, but is instead like Cupcake frosting.

48
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:23,242
Rym: I remember I'd be sitting there and Chocolate.

49
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:26,131
Rym: Hey, I'll trade you my great white for some combos.

50
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,034
Rym: Yeah, how about that?

51
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:28,780
Scott: an inverse peanut M&M, right?

52
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,828
Scott: It's a pretzel and chocolate on the inside.

53
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,398
Rym: What about a peanut injected with chocolate?

54
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:33,760
Rym: somehow?

55
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:35,265
Rym: Some sort of mutant peanut.

56
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:36,851
Scott: You can't really hollow out a peanut.

57
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:37,974
Rym: Okay.

58
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:38,597
Rym: It won't be much.

59
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,560
Scott: Here's what you could do.

60
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,460
Scott: Right, you know peanuts usually come in a shell, but if you buy planners, they get rid of all the shells for you.

61
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:51,380
Scott: Yeah, well, yeah What if you made a chocolate in the shape of a full peanut shell and then you play?

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,119
Scott: Inside where the two peanuts that are supposed to go in there?

63
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,349
Rym: No No, you got to mix it up.

64
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,065
Rym: if it's shaped like a peanut You don't want peanuts inside of.

65
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:00,791
Rym: you want like capers or something just weird.

66
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,738
Scott: Okay capers and chocolate.

67
00:03:02,758 --> 00:03:03,220
Scott: That's all you.

68
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,265
Rym: But the vuvuzela.

69
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:11,380
Rym: everyone knows about these things now, like they're popular culture even among people who don't care about sports or soccer.

70
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:14,825
Rym: Notice my subtle joke there.

71
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:15,286
Rym: Uh-huh.

72
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:18,437
Rym: So I was thinking what can we do now?

73
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,420
Rym: Because if you make a joke about them like this like late show people are gonna be making jokes about these things like their pop culture.

74
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,950
Rym: Someone's got to bring one of these things to a fucking golf game.

75
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:31,210
Scott: Golf game.

76
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:33,337
Scott: Yeah, it's it's a round.

77
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:35,223
Rym: I'm gonna call it a game because I don't like golf.

78
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,250
Rym: Okay plus alliteration.

79
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,110
Rym: Don't you prefer alliteration golf game as opposed to golf match GM?

80
00:03:42,576 --> 00:03:43,407
Scott: No, that's not.

81
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,100
Rym: Hey, let's go play a game of golf.

82
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,396
Scott: That's different.

83
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:50,424
Rym: I've never played golf.

84
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,249
Rym: I have no idea.

85
00:03:51,711 --> 00:04:04,119
Rym: Plus we say a game of putt-putt With the club at a hole And usually our scores are worse.

86
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:06,350
Scott: it's it's what are you talking about?

87
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,561
Rym: Well, if you average the front row crew, they're much worse.

88
00:04:09,822 --> 00:04:18,546
Scott: Okay, I was gonna say like The average like score you're gonna get playing around a putt-putt is gonna be a lot better than the score You would get playing actual golf.

89
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:18,928
Scott: I don't know.

90
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,240
Rym: I feel like with a lot of the people I play putt-putt with.

91
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,549
Rym: maybe it's just because I played it a lot more as a Kid, but I know a lot of people where the an average of an entire group would be six.

92
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:33,254
Scott: Okay, so let's say you are playing Golf right.

93
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:34,759
Scott: golf has 18 holes.

94
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,150
Scott: Yeah, and you know, there's a some par threes fours and fives.

95
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:40,529
Scott: So we'll say average of par four, right?

96
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:50,540
Scott: So four times 18 is what 80 minus 18 times 2 is 16. easy answer to 64.

97
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,227
Rym: the average score among most people who play putt-putt is gonna be 18 to 5 times.

98
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,134
Scott: Uh, yeah, right.

99
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:04,651
Scott: so 18 times 6 right is what is worse than 18 times 4.

100
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:04,952
Scott: Yes.

101
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:05,413
Scott: Okay.

102
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:11,130
Scott: So the thing is if you play if you're playing right regular old golf on an actual golf course.

103
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:14,740
Scott: Right, you think you're gonna get it in the hole in six.

104
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:15,943
Rym: It depends.

105
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:17,548
Scott: No, not even close.

106
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:18,290
Scott: You're gonna hit it.

107
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,230
Scott: It's gonna go in the tree and you're gonna hit it.

108
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,230
Scott: It's gonna go in the water if you're even lucky to even hit it anywhere near straight.

109
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,418
Scott: But anyway, we're gonna go in another tree.

110
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:27,784
Scott: They're gonna take a drop all my.

111
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:29,550
Scott: you're gonna get like tens and 12.

112
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:39,618
Rym: I feel like the way to make the vuvuzela Awesome right now is to bring it out in grossly inappropriate Context all the time.

113
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:45,652
Scott: Well, I think you know, pretty much what's gonna happen is the vuvuzela is gonna be banned Everywhere.

114
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:49,625
Scott: we already banned it like every soccer was banned at Wimbledon.

115
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:53,375
Scott: I'm sure it's gonna be banned in like We can make some bank.

116
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:56,564
Rym: we got to make a sniper rifle vuvuzela.

117
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:58,870
Rym: that like breaks down into parts or collapses.

118
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,518
Rym: So you can stick that in your pocket.

119
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,130
Rym: You're sitting there Tiger Woods is up against Nicholson.

120
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:04,375
Rym: They're about to do some things.

121
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:11,802
Rym: you turn around you go go 13 it and then vuvuzela And then they just grab you and kick you out.

122
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:13,530
Scott: Yeah, and then you're banned forever.

123
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:14,112
Rym: That's fine.

124
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:17,003
Scott: You wait till hole 17 and you paid how much money for that?

125
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:18,409
Rym: It might be worth it.

126
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:19,713
Scott: It's all you.

127
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:24,287
Rym: if you never want to go back there's no reason not to get kicked out of any event.

128
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:30,529
Scott: at the very end At the very oh, you're gonna wait until the very very end to whip it out.

129
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:37,820
Rym: I have one other phrase for you.

130
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,537
Rym: This won't frighten you because we might not be going but Animacons, they're gonna sneak him in.

131
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:45,104
Scott: No, they're gonna ban them.

132
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,530
Rym: I know they are but they're gonna sneak him in.

133
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:51,564
Scott: People just Right 26,000 people.

134
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:58,110
Rym: even if they eliminate 99% of the vuvuzela as they get in the door, you're gonna get some vuvuzela.

135
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:09,769
Scott: The problem is right is let's say banning a vuvuzela is really really really easy Unless anyone who uses it, it's gigantic, right and anyone who uses it.

136
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:15,249
Scott: You can find them immediately because they're making a really loud noise and they can't really get away from you.

137
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:16,839
Rym: The other way to go right.

138
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,670
Rym: so we've got to make the collapsible ones.

139
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:24,989
Scott: Their only hope is to abandon their vuvuzela and run and blend into a crowd in which case you win.

140
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,059
Scott: now They're vuvuzelous.

141
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,170
Rym: You got to plan this out.

142
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:40,749
Rym: You got to have the I am Spartacus situation where you vuvuzela and while they're coming to get you someone on the other side vuvuzela Or in public places you just flash mob it and then disappear.

143
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,769
Scott: Yeah, you could definitely do a flash mob.

144
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:50,355
Rym: You know people are hanging out like having lunch in one of those parks in Manhattan and suddenly there's like a hundred people Vuvuzelous for like I did.

145
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:52,241
Scott: I did see a video of a flash mob.

146
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:57,542
Scott: a whole bunch of people went down to like an amateur Soccer match like oh, that was awesome.

147
00:07:57,723 --> 00:08:07,316
Scott: And they just filled the stands Smoke bombs and then they got you know, they got naked and streaked across the field and That was pretty good.

148
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:15,870
Scott: I like how the players and the refs tried to fight it at first Like a whole bunch of people to show up at like a little league and do that same thing even with the streaking and everything.

149
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,812
Rym: see the thing Really?

150
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,850
Scott: Yeah, those people would get on the sex offender list would be so awesome.

151
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,705
Scott: It wouldn't be me some other guy that wouldn't be you.

152
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:25,730
Scott: he wouldn't know any better.

153
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,281
Rym: See I real.

154
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:32,551
Rym: but again The only reason this isn't gonna happen and we can never do an awesome thing with these things is that no one knows how to Fucking.

155
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:33,596
Rym: use them in America.

156
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:35,063
Scott: Yeah people know how to use.

157
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:36,429
Rym: they're gonna just put their mouth up to it.

158
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:45,479
Rym: Almost feel would be funnier if you didn't actually blow in it You're just yelling vuvuzela through it like it's.

159
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,449
Scott: I think I think people would figure it out.

160
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:48,818
Scott: It's kind of hard to do.

161
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:50,269
Scott: it's not that hard to do it.

162
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:56,050
Scott: See here's the thing right is that you you're you're making a lot of assumptions because you are a trumpet person.

163
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:03,590
Rym: Right, basically the vuvuzela is constructed in such a way that basically all you know It's harder to keep to make a tone in that than in a trumpet, right?

164
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,172
Scott: And here's the.

165
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,420
Scott: this is this is the very problem with the.

166
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,858
Scott: if you had one and you played into it with your trumpeting Skills, it would actually sound pretty good.

167
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:19,409
Scott: The reason it sounds the way it does because everyone basically just looks and When you go into a vuvuzela, it makes that noise that it makes.

168
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:24,050
Rym: well Actually, it really can only make a really flat like B flat.

169
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:28,910
Scott: Yeah, that's the noise it makes and all you have to do is go which everyone in there and their mother can do.

170
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,490
Scott: Yeah, you don't actually have to have a quality armature or anything going on.

171
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:44,710
Scott: And if you do have a quality armature, then it would sound good It would actually make a solid note, let me tell you my vuvuzela which I called it a stadium horn.

172
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:49,589
Rym: That thing did not make a pleasant noise about how good a trumpet player you are.

173
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:54,713
Scott: Well the ones that from what I've heard the ones that they have down there That's how they work is.

174
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:59,630
Scott: you basically need no skill whatsoever to get it to emit the droning noise.

175
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:01,619
Rym: You have to at least figure out you have to go.

176
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,110
Scott: everybody knows you don't even know you had to go.

177
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:09,241
Scott: Just you don't even need to go, you know You have to get the resonance.

178
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:16,764
Rym: I can show you You don't everyone Physics if it makes a sound at all, you're getting the resonance if you're not.

179
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,741
Rym: if it if you don't make the resonance It won't make enough noise for anyone to hear.

180
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:28,830
Rym: from what everyone is told I know you're saying just go and it works but it had but unless you get the resonance it won't make any noise.

181
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:42,070
Scott: Well, it seems to be that it's incredibly easy to use because thousands and thousands of non musicians are able to make it make No in a place with no training whatsoever place where apparently it is the most popular pastime instrument and sport.

182
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:44,940
Scott: You know, they've only been around since like Oh one.

183
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,988
Scott: It's not like an old pastime Yeah, it's like, you know, I remember I was at.

184
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:58,450
Rym: you know the stadium soccer games I go to was a kid right and they sold him and My brother and I got him because we were both trumpet players and we were in the crowd's basically being obnoxious.

185
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:02,310
Rym: Everyone else bought him and hardly anyone was able to make him make a noise.

186
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:08,410
Rym: I guess I just I don't have a lot of confidence in the average American to make a sound out of a booboozilla.

187
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:12,439
Scott: You know, that's just That's just you.

188
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,329
Scott: All right.

189
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,707
Rym: So got anything to talk about like Mexico and Spain and France and North Korea and soccer.

190
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,750
Rym: that I don't watch so much.

191
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,898
Rym: But I watched the game between Mexico and France.

192
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,400
Scott: I don't know.

193
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,946
Scott: I mean the World Cup is we got?

194
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:26,253
Scott: see I'm 20.

195
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:31,388
Scott: So there's been a lot of World Cups in my life But the only one I ever paid any attention to it all was when it was actually in the u.s.

196
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,950
Rym: The long time ago, this is actually the first one I paid attention to only because I have a lot of foreign-born co-workers.

197
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,552
Rym: So they're all really.

198
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:42,670
Scott: the only reason I'm paying attention to it so much is because it's actually available for watching.

199
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:45,703
Rym: You know easily aren't you using a pirate stream though?

200
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:47,873
Scott: Well, I'm using a pirate stream But it's also.

201
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:50,985
Scott: there's a some free Spanish streaming on Univision.

202
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:51,246
Rym: Is it?

203
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:52,090
Rym: Okay for you?

204
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,630
Scott: It's also on ABC which I get for free.

205
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,970
Rym: Is it okay to use the pirate stream if a legitimate stream of the same thing was technically already available to you?

206
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,867
Scott: Anyway, the pirate stream is in English and the Spanish one is not.

207
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:09,527
Scott: so You know, I mean as far as I'm concerned, it's always okay to use a pirate stream.

208
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:10,170
Scott: Why would it not be?

209
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:11,683
Rym: Okay, I feel like it.

210
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:15,964
Scott: this world They're not gonna charge you money if I go down to the bar and just sit there.

211
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:21,569
Scott: right the bar won't even you know Technically can't force me to even buy a drink and can't kick me out just for sitting there.

212
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,596
Rym: Well charge you a cover.

213
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,021
Scott: Yeah, but they don't.

214
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,630
Scott: they say there's a guy out and he sees like free admission.

215
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,038
Scott: Come on in free admission, right?

216
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:31,170
Scott: So I could just do that.

217
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,090
Scott: So why would it be illegal for me to just do the same thing in my apartment?

218
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,602
Scott: Not anyone any money it is but actually it's not.

219
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,730
Scott: I don't think it's illegal for me to watch the pirate stream.

220
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:49,382
Scott: It's illegal for the pirates to pirate the stream because they are Re-broadcasting without the expressed written consent in all the stuff so far.

221
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:56,567
Rym: No one has ever made a successful lawsuit for Using pirated media in that fashion only for distributing.

222
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:57,510
Scott: Yes, exactly.

223
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:05,158
Scott: So these guys and I know they're in Florida in California because I can see their local cable TV commercials You pay for the pirated stream.

224
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:07,486
Rym: I'm pretty sure now you're breaking straight-up law.

225
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:08,370
Scott: Yeah, I'm not paying for it.

226
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:13,094
Scott: Well, yeah, but it doesn't matter Accepting money for the pirate stream.

227
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:16,522
Rym: if you were pirating a pirate stream that was pay.

228
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:29,969
Scott: I Think we need to do the Simpsons strategy with a barge that has major league rebroadcast major league baseball without expressed written consent and only implied verbal consent.

229
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:33,849
Scott: So our implied oral consent.

230
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:44,938
Rym: Well, one of my co-workers the other senior guy in my office right like we sit back to back and he's you know French and he expected France to beat Mexico obviously, but he doesn't expect No, but he did.

231
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,162
Rym: he was like, yeah France isn't gonna win.

232
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:46,924
Rym: you were doubting l3.

233
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:52,110
Rym: They're not high in my bracket They're gonna choke because they're playing all defensively and bullshitty and whatever.

234
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:57,530
Rym: So I walk out of the office and I'm you know, standing with someone else talking and I see Mexico score.

235
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:01,143
Rym: I'm like, huh, and then I see Mexico score again a little while later.

236
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,150
Scott: So that was a while later.

237
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,730
Rym: Yeah, cuz I was out of the office for a while.

238
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:10,742
Rym: So I walk back in just after this and I looked at him and I just played dumb and I was like Hey, it looks like France is up to nothing.

239
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:12,170
Rym: Hey, isn't this awesome?

240
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:15,458
Rym: That's the best I could do.

241
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,289
Rym: I don't have any humor to make with the World Cup.

242
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:20,310
Scott: No, all the humor is in the in the vuvuzela.

243
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:26,831
Scott: Yeah, I think that the World Cup will be like ten times more exciting once we're in the round of 16.

244
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:36,783
Scott: You know the the group rounds, you know, there's some excitement like, you know Spain going down big surprise Stuff like that North Korea's goal, you know North Korea.

245
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:38,910
Scott: It's like I. it's such a weird thing.

246
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,045
Scott: It's like I'd obviously don't want them to win because that would be like but I want those players like.

247
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:46,682
Scott: it's like I sorta I sort of feel bad for the North Korean players.

248
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:48,330
Scott: It's like are they bad guys?

249
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,414
Scott: Probably not.

250
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:54,559
Scott: Well, the worst thing is I mean, they're sort of bad because I mean I'm sure that they're well-fed when the rest of the country isn't.

251
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:55,764
Scott: so that's sort of.

252
00:14:55,884 --> 00:14:57,550
Scott: but at the same time do they even know?

253
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:00,397
Rym: They're shielded from all that who knows?

254
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:03,907
Scott: but they're obviously not bad people right?

255
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:06,274
Scott: They're not evil dudes They're not looking to hurt anyone.

256
00:15:06,294 --> 00:15:08,662
Scott: They're clearly robots and you know, they're just.

257
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:10,690
Scott: it's not their fault that they were born in North Korea.

258
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:15,509
Scott: You know, they could have been born anywhere, you know, it was just born.

259
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:21,506
Scott: So, you know, they're just playing to be a sport just like everyone else, you know, they're.

260
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,750
Scott: you know, they're not being bad.

261
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:29,850
Rym: I don't want them to win because I don't want North Korea to have that feather in his cap But I want them to score meaningful goals.

262
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:33,954
Scott: Well, I'm pretty sure they're not getting out of the the group round So it doesn't matter.

263
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:39,606
Rym: actually what I would I would really hope for I know won't happen is if somehow They would all just be like we're not coming back.

264
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:40,049
Rym: We defect.

265
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:47,387
Scott: Well, I think that some of them like like two or three of them actually You know work.

266
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:53,730
Scott: They're like play on real soccer teams Like and I think some one of them plays in like the Japanese League and stuff like that.

267
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,925
Scott: So these guys aren't you know, like trapped in North Korea necessarily.

268
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:00,393
Rym: They probably a family I mean most of them are.

269
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:01,978
Scott: one interesting thing though.

270
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:08,694
Scott: Is that you know, a lot of these others pretty much all the soccer teams Like for example the US team right.

271
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:11,620
Scott: those guys don't really play as a team very much.

272
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:27,050
Scott: They usually they're a bunch of you know, they play in MLS they play in European League They play wherever they play and then when it's time to do some US stuff, you know, like Confederations Cup or whatever You know, they all get together and they they play like that.

273
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,658
Scott: So the thing is the North Korean team.

274
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,230
Scott: the vast majority of the team actually plays together a lot.

275
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:36,643
Scott: So if you compare them to the other teams you they actually have more.

276
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:47,869
Scott: they're more unified and the you know More teamwork going on than pretty much anyone else still doesn't make up for the lack of talent but You know teamwork it counts for something.

277
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:54,311
Scott: and you know If the team's with a lot of talent like Spain right had some huge teamwork going on They could.

278
00:16:54,532 --> 00:17:00,310
Scott: they would probably be like way more dominant and you know, not losing it a big upset the Switzerland.

279
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:13,490
Rym: So before we get to cosmos things of the day, I don't know how long it'll be before this gets taken down.

280
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:20,010
Rym: If it's not there by the time you click on this, I'm sorry, but I will never tire of watching downfall parody videos.

281
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:20,993
Scott: Uh-huh.

282
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:24,250
Rym: I feel like I have to watch this movie because it looks like it's an amazing movie.

283
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:25,950
Rym: It's an amazing movie.

284
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:26,765
Rym: I've never seen it.

285
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:33,707
Rym: But that scene is just so powerful and when juxtaposed with Hitler complaining about the vuvuzela.

286
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:37,398
Rym: I Laughed out loud like three times during.

287
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,346
Scott: I wanted to you know, make my thing of the day.

288
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,310
Scott: vuvuzela jokes.

289
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:44,129
Scott: You know cuz there's so many good ones like the haters gonna have.

290
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:50,725
Scott: And the And the music note the music sheet one, this is the one note.

291
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:51,306
Scott: go right.

292
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:52,530
Scott: so this is plan.

293
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:56,090
Scott: What does the website you can go to that will add a vuvuzela to any website?

294
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,610
Scott: There's a lot of good stuff out there and it the joke itself is not funny.

295
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:06,210
Scott: But the clever, you know, it's it's the the cleverness of how you tell the joke, you know what it is.

296
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:14,678
Rym: It's like the aristocrats or it's like the old Photoshop Fridays like the originals like here's a picture of four nerds And then everyone just like use.

297
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:17,830
Rym: it's like variations on a theme like everyone has the same theme.

298
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:19,346
Rym: What can you do with it?

299
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,070
Scott: Some.

300
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:25,470
Scott: I'm waiting for someone to make the vuvuzela video game like a playable game and all you do is push a button.

301
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,214
Scott: and it was Text adventure.

302
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,201
Rym: you have found a vuvuzela or?

303
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:55,122
Scott: no, they should add in FIFA 20 You get from EA Sports, right you go in the options menu and this volume and it's like music volume sound effects volume announcer volume vuvuzela volume and the vuvuzela volume meter is three times longer than Anyway, so for a thing of the day.

304
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:56,390
Scott: instead, I've got this video.

305
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,170
Scott: I found this is actually I think a quality thing of the day because usually we find a thing of the day from some blog.

306
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,790
Scott: Right, so we'll find a link on Boeing Boeing or a link on Kotaku or a link on College Humor to something else.

307
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:12,010
Scott: This was I found it directly on YouTube itself.

308
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:15,180
Scott: There was not a link from anywhere else except for the YouTube homepage.

309
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,470
Scott: And what this is is the case of the poopy Nintendo.

310
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:23,305
Rym: Oh my god, that was one of the funniest things I've seen in a while.

311
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:29,549
Scott: It's it's basically a mystery of a Nintendo with poop.

312
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:42,210
Rym: Another case this guy solves the mystery the telling of the story in this one and especially the diagrams As to whether or not it was feasible for one of the suspects to have poopy to the Nintendo.

313
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:44,995
Scott: Yes, no court cases.

314
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:46,659
Scott: It is really necessary here.

315
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,112
Scott: You know, it's a pretty much cut and dry or cut and mushy Situation.

316
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:52,935
Rym: Oh my god.

317
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:56,690
Rym: I can't imagine I would have had that been me and I went to play a game first.

318
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,183
Rym: I wouldn't have noticed I would have put a game in it wouldn't have worked and I would.

319
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:03,024
Rym: but that's the brilliance of the Nintendo poopy.

320
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:08,470
Scott: But what if the thing is top loader has a poopy shield, yeah, it does but you can't.

321
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:11,198
Rym: Yeah, no way but think of this.

322
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:13,428
Rym: Here's here's the brilliance of the poop plan, right?

323
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,270
Rym: Yeah, I don't know if they even thought of this but it's a brilliant brilliant plan.

324
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:22,546
Rym: So I go I stick Super Mario 3 in the Nintendo and it doesn't work which happens.

325
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:23,710
Scott: So what do I do?

326
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:24,492
Scott: I pull it out.

327
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:25,777
Rym: I put the game.

328
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,309
Rym: I've just put in right up against my mouth to go.

329
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,910
Scott: Well, you would notice when it didn't pop right out cuz it was all stuck and squishy.

330
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:35,075
Rym: Well, I don't think it would get stuck.

331
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,928
Rym: I think it would pop right out and I wouldn't notice right to the mouth.

332
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:49,118
Scott: And then you know the breathe in what the fuck Poop your face dude, if she gets it, we should sell.

333
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:51,565
Scott: who was halas and put poopy in them.

334
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:52,929
Scott: and then when someone?

335
00:20:57,391 --> 00:21:03,350
Rym: Actually, the super soaker is the best way to end the vuvuzela thread you just shoot it right up the the muzzle.

336
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:07,285
Scott: There has to be something you can do to get it up.

337
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:14,267
Rym: Anyway, like I said a gentle love tap to the end of the vuvuzela will cause severe extreme pain in the wielder.

338
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:17,154
Scott: Mm-hmm Really cuz.

339
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:19,330
Scott: I mean like you can put a mute on a trumpet and it's like whatever.

340
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:21,960
Rym: Yeah, the mute holds it in.

341
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,646
Rym: I'm talking about tapping it like bop.

342
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,345
Scott: Oh Basically punching them in the face basically a stick via the vuvuzela.

343
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:34,482
Rym: I said, okay It's like who wouldn't to vuvuzela, whatever the meta moment.

344
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:35,284
Rym: Would you get into it?

345
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:37,390
Rym: Oh, this is a book club episode.

346
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:42,870
Rym: We haven't been doing him that often because Rym doesn't know how to read and you kids probably didn't read this book either.

347
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:44,499
Scott: I think a bunch of people read the book.

348
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,001
Rym: I hope so.

349
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:45,665
Scott: Maybe they're.

350
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,630
Scott: hopefully they'll read it now.

351
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:50,303
Rym: But can I come July 9th and all that will be there.

352
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:52,009
Rym: it's gonna be awesome focus too soon.

353
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,826
Rym: Oh my god this weekend is the nerd NYC recess in Manhattan.

354
00:21:55,846 --> 00:21:56,690
Rym: You should go check that out.

355
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,240
Rym: We'll be there Saturday all day.

356
00:21:58,281 --> 00:21:59,368
Scott: gaming action.

357
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:01,900
Rym: We're gonna announce the next book club book.

358
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:02,886
Rym: Maybe we should do it right now.

359
00:22:03,148 --> 00:22:06,790
Rym: right now I'm not gonna wait maybe for the people who didn't read this book.

360
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:09,504
Rym: So at least there's a chance before they turn off the episode.

361
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:10,489
Rym: They know what the next book is.

362
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,433
Scott: All right, we could do that.

363
00:22:11,493 --> 00:22:14,405
Rym: So it's your turn to pick I believe basically right.

364
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:21,930
Scott: so Gabe from penny arcade He only likes books that have pictures of rocket ships or planets on the cover right or Star Wars.

365
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:27,084
Rym: so Star Wars books don't have pictures of rockets or planets on the cover in all cases.

366
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:27,886
Scott: No, they usually do.

367
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:36,350
Scott: but anyway, he He you know, he's he's slowly been getting away You know, he's played some RPGs and D&D and that sort of thing.

368
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:40,327
Scott: So he asked on Twitter a while back like what book do I read?

369
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:40,709
Scott: Right?

370
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:43,885
Scott: So There were all kinds of suggestions being tweeted at him.

371
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:51,105
Scott: So Someone sort went and combined all of the suggestions into like a sheet and was like up.

372
00:22:51,145 --> 00:22:55,317
Scott: this was suggested ten times and this Five times and this right, you know the X time.

373
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:59,630
Scott: so you could see all the suggestions together and which ones were the most suggested.

374
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:13,109
Scott: so I look at this list and I'm looking and a lot of it is like ra Salvatore bla bla bla or song of ice and fire And I'm like Dragon land something I'm like.

375
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:21,972
Rym: What's funny is if you look at the level of those books like the forgotten realms ones were some of the least shitty of those Books.

376
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:24,689
Rym: you can have a dragon Lance dear God.

377
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:35,685
Scott: there was some pretty bad books suggested but there was one book that was suggested that had a great many suggestions many and I had never heard of it and it was called the lies of Locke Lamora.

378
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:36,749
Scott: and I was like, what is this?

379
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:47,560
Scott: So I look it up and Apparently it was a fantasy novel about some sort of con artist, dude Already up my alley.

380
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,849
Scott: So I'm like, huh?

381
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:57,896
Scott: That seems like the kind of book that is gonna have some sort of maybe American gods ish kind of action in it maybe something.

382
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:03,445
Rym: so also, you know Scott was explaining it to me and It has one of the things that I'm an absolute sucker for.

383
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:06,902
Rym: any time There's precursor technology in anything.

384
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:08,430
Rym: I'm all about that shit.

385
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,439
Scott: Yeah, you know it's a sign of a good book when you've got.

386
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,950
Scott: you know, there's some sort of world with all these mysteries.

387
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:21,852
Scott: But the story is just about people living in this world and isn't about the mystery of the world like cowboy bebop Exactly.

388
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:31,986
Scott: If you go to Amazon a hundred and eleven five-star reviews 56 four-star reviews only 16 three stars 12 two stars and nine one star.

389
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:34,133
Scott: see whenever I find like that It's a pretty good.

390
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:37,129
Rym: I always read every single one of the one-star reviews.

391
00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:38,414
Scott: Yep Just to see.

392
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:46,944
Scott: the other thing is that you look in the front of the book where you know There's all the quotes from reviews saying how great the book is and there's like a ton of pages.

393
00:24:46,964 --> 00:24:49,210
Scott: all like it's like multiple.

394
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:50,834
Rym: Wait a minute Scott.

395
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:52,763
Rym: The book is called the lies of locked lab.

396
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,828
Rym: Are you sure they're not all just lies?

397
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,249
Scott: No, there's like multiple pages of you know pull quotes from positive reviews for the book.

398
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:02,670
Scott: It usually they only put a few in like the back cover in the front cover.

399
00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:04,638
Scott: This is like a whole section of them.

400
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,590
Scott: All right, so I'm like, all right, there is something up with this book.

401
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:08,980
Rym: Well, especially look at the title.

402
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:10,290
Rym: It's got pretty good alliteration.

403
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:18,350
Rym: Yeah, very good Kind I like the lot and I like how it's like the definite article like it's there like the lies of locked lamera.

404
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:20,421
Scott: So, you know, it's been out for a while.

405
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:21,970
Scott: It's by this guy named Scott Lynch.

406
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,830
Scott: It's actually been out so long that as a sequel the sequel is called Red Seas Under Red Skies.

407
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:31,290
Scott: I bought the sequel but I haven't read it yet And they're both mass-market paperbacks.

408
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:32,969
Scott: They've been out for a while and they're way cheap.

409
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:39,090
Scott: So I got it and I read it and it was pretty awesome and it should totally be a movie.

410
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:45,330
Rym: So what I'm curious about just doesn't get some perspective better or worse than say the prince of nothing books like the first one.

411
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,662
Scott: Oh, it's not it's not like Prince nothing.

412
00:25:47,743 --> 00:25:51,056
Scott: It's not you know, okay It doesn't really have.

413
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:56,836
Scott: you know, the the the deepness and intellectualness It is you know, it is.

414
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:59,505
Scott: it is a story and it is about what happens in.

415
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:06,099
Scott: the story is very literal There isn't like a huge deep Symbology and such and such.

416
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:06,340
Scott: fine.

417
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,024
Rym: I was just curious.

418
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:08,150
Rym: I'm still down for it.

419
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:16,399
Scott: I mean, it's you know, dude, there's some adventures and there's some fighting and lies lots of lies And you know, the thing is is like shit happens.

420
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:19,327
Scott: you I didn't see coming for shit shit.

421
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:20,290
Scott: It's like whoa.

422
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,083
Scott: There was like two or three times in the book where it's like.

423
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:25,450
Scott: whoa did not just happen.

424
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,955
Scott: Oh my god spoilers.

425
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:30,690
Rym: and I was really surprised at the end when he whips out the vuvuzela and brings down.

426
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:34,609
Scott: So It's a pretty quality book.

427
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:39,630
Scott: It's a good choice because I already read it and that means that we'll just wait for Rym to read it.

428
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:46,970
Scott: Yeah, I'll order it on Amazon tonight and then You know I can read other things in the meantime.

429
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:51,505
Rym: Actually, the problem is I just started reading a book that I should have read but I've never read.

430
00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:52,809
Rym: thus begs our threestra.

431
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,225
Rym: So I got to stop that to finish Locke Lamora and then start that back up again.

432
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:57,190
Scott: Yeah, it doesn't take that long.

433
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,236
Scott: I mean Locke Lamora is.

434
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:03,400
Scott: it's not a short book, you know, it's a pretty standard like the Prince of Nothing or like Hyperion.

435
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:03,902
Rym: there's not.

436
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:09,744
Rym: I doubt it's going to be Information and you know, it's not gonna have the density of one of those books.

437
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,350
Scott: No, it's pretty much this happens.

438
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,092
Scott: This happens.

439
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,176
Scott: someone so says this.

440
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,139
Scott: Hey, what's going on?

441
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:14,961
Scott: It's just happens.

442
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:16,687
Rym: It's lyrical and eloquent at least right?

443
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:17,770
Rym: Not like lensman.

444
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:22,824
Rym: Look, I mean The language was very direct and very like.

445
00:27:22,864 --> 00:27:23,830
Rym: this is what is happening.

446
00:27:24,353 --> 00:27:26,869
Rym: Is it like that or is it more like the Llewellyn kind of?

447
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,474
Scott: Yeah, it's pretty normal.

448
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:29,794
Rym: is there?

449
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:32,160
Rym: no no prose like to the style stand out at all?

450
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,335
Rym: Yeah, I'm just curious.

451
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:35,720
Rym: I haven't read anything about it yet.

452
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,547
Rym: Except the spoiler side about it's not.

453
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:41,107
Scott: it's not exactly You know all poetic like Tokin or anything.

454
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:43,008
Rym: Okay I'm just curious.

455
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:44,916
Scott: All right, so that's that.

456
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:45,620
Rym: All right.

457
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,549
Rym: I think that's it for the meta stuff.

458
00:27:48,394 --> 00:27:51,469
Rym: If you if you're in the city come to the recess this weekend, we'll see ya.

459
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:55,888
Rym: We'll probably all go out to a nice dinner somewhere cuz it's not like these events are super crowded.

460
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:58,881
Rym: Nope We don't have to hide from anyone like we do some anime cons either.

461
00:27:58,901 --> 00:28:04,710
Rym: Hmm unless it's overcrowded Yep, and we might have a whole bunch of stuff coming up in the city in the near future.

462
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:07,444
Rym: But we'll talk about that in a future metamoment.

463
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,193
Rym: Yeah It'll be fun.

464
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:10,795
Scott: Whatever.

465
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:22,158
Rym: so the previous book that we finished the book that I picked Carl Sagan's cosmos We have both read it completely me for the second time Scott for the first time though I'll admit the first time I read it as a kid.

466
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:25,309
Rym: I skipped a whole bunch in the middle that reading.

467
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:26,479
Rym: now I wish I hadn't skipped.

468
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,469
Scott: that did not really count.

469
00:28:28,494 --> 00:28:29,277
Rym: It wouldn't account in any way.

470
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:30,824
Rym: I didn't remember half of this stuff.

471
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:35,522
Scott: Uh-huh Anyway, the so cosmos.

472
00:28:35,562 --> 00:28:42,250
Scott: I think the first thing about cosmos Right is that this is like the best deal in terms of value for dollar.

473
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:44,790
Rym: Oh my god this book for like four dollars.

474
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:53,239
Scott: No, no, but I mean in terms of what you get right because you get a science book And History book and you know, it's like.

475
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,250
Scott: it's like multiple books all in one book.

476
00:28:56,991 --> 00:29:00,463
Scott: Yeah, it's not like, you know, you bought a book and it's just one thing.

477
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:02,150
Scott: It's like three books at a time.

478
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:04,222
Rym: Well, what really struck me about it now?

479
00:29:04,282 --> 00:29:05,208
Rym: I didn't think of it as a kid.

480
00:29:05,248 --> 00:29:06,436
Rym: I read it I was like, that's awesome.

481
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:21,510
Rym: But reading it now it's amazing how well it tells you the story of the cosmos or the story of the universe to the point that it Feels almost like you're reading a novel like you're never bored or they're like always explaining some shit about neutrons.

482
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:23,444
Rym: You're like then what did the Neutron do?

483
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:24,170
Rym: Holy shit.

484
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:41,585
Scott: Yeah, usually like you read a nonfiction book of any kind, you know, and it's just like You can fall asleep pretty easily in the vast majority of them because you know They're stating a bunch of facts or it's a bunch of essays making arguments or even like Stephen Hawking books are pretty readable But it'll be like such and such and such.

485
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:42,330
Scott: Here's a fun example.

486
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:44,350
Scott: Such as such is a fun example.

487
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:50,186
Rym: They're like Michio Kaku where it makes sense for a while But then the analogies get so complex that he starts analogizing the analogies.

488
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:54,544
Scott: You just fucking lose me Yeah, but this book is like so readable.

489
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,090
Scott: You can just keep going no problem.

490
00:29:56,271 --> 00:30:02,990
Rym: And the thing is I think anyone with you know, at least anyone without mental difficulties could understand everything in this book.

491
00:30:03,212 --> 00:30:14,750
Rym: Oh, yeah, like in the way it's presented I think there was one part of the book that had maths that some people might not be able to understand Where he's like, you know all the the how many the odds of alien civilizations existing anywhere.

492
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:21,630
Scott: Yeah, there's also some people might not be able to understand the you know, the the math of like the orbits, right?

493
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,613
Rym: Yeah, I guess you're right.

494
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:25,970
Rym: The math could be out of reach of some people but at least the concepts.

495
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:32,970
Rym: I don't think there's any concept in this book that anyone with a hundred IQ could not grasp in a meaningful at least analogous manner.

496
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:38,010
Scott: Yeah, you know in fact, you know, like I grasp pretty much the whole book, right?

497
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:48,564
Scott: But there were actually many things in the book that I just did not know or I feel like I should have known but was Quite stupid and just never because like I was never really into astronomy.

498
00:30:48,644 --> 00:30:50,550
Scott: I never thought about it really at all.

499
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,536
Scott: You know, I knew things like.

500
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:57,210
Scott: you have a telescope you pointed at the sky you look so you didn't know like pulsars versus quasars.

501
00:30:58,151 --> 00:30:59,237
Scott: Well, no, I didn't know that.

502
00:30:59,298 --> 00:31:05,970
Scott: but like the most basic kind of thing I didn't even know but like as soon as they said it I was like, oh that's really obvious.

503
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:14,428
Scott: I should have known that is that you look up at the sky and the stars never move but the planets move around all the time and they move around.

504
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:18,650
Scott: like And I was like, oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense.

505
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:22,642
Scott: I never thought about it because I've never even thought about astronomy or cared.

506
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:34,538
Scott: really it's interesting because when I was that's how Right, the people in ancient times were able to know that these things are planets and those things weren't even though they didn't have telescopes Or shit was because they were fucking moving around.

507
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:47,240
Rym: the fascinating part when he gets into like even modern astronomy like he talks about how people actually figured these things out and just the attention to detail and the tiny things like, you know, You make a thousand measurements of like.

508
00:31:47,561 --> 00:32:05,425
Rym: this is where that star was on this day And this is where it was on this day and you have a thousand in a row and you think you've got it down and then one day it's slightly off from where you expect and You realize everything you thought was completely wrong and you have to kind of figure out the new thing and that people did that and we humans

509
00:32:05,486 --> 00:32:05,788
Scott: knew a

510
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,689
Rym: Substantial amount of what we know today a long time ago.

511
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,042
Scott: Well, I think part of it also right is imagine you had no TV.

512
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:14,146
Scott: You had no books.

513
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:18,050
Scott: You had no arts You had no nothing right and there's no lights either.

514
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,349
Scott: So you look up at the sky every single night and you see all that shit all of it, right?

515
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,158
Scott: No, you sit there for like hours.

516
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:27,305
Scott: Just looking at it every goddamn day.

517
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:28,610
Scott: You know what you're gonna notice.

518
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:30,576
Scott: You're gonna remember what it looks like.

519
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:39,070
Scott: you're gonna memorize the locations of different bits and you're gonna see if like the red dot moves around None of these dots move except that red one.

520
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:53,630
Rym: Imagine - in a demon haunted world like in in an era when you we don't know what's out there You might mean there are people they would think, you know They're looking up at the gods or the faces of the gods or some like they had no idea what the stars were.

521
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,654
Rym: but You know.

522
00:32:55,855 --> 00:33:01,259
Rym: imagine just the feeling of power of studying something like that back then when for all you know Those are gods you're studying.

523
00:33:01,582 --> 00:33:02,449
Rym: Yeah, like legit.

524
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:17,209
Rym: But it's interesting to me that especially the astronomy stuff that a lot of this I knew from a kid because I was really really Really into astronomy and I had all these books and I read them all the time and I'd read this But I'd forgotten most of this because it doesn't come up in my daily life.

525
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:27,309
Rym: yeah, like I just I'd never thought once about pulsars and quasars and the structure of the galaxies and all that until I Read this book again, and I remembered how absolutely fascinating it all is.

526
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:43,037
Scott: Yeah, and you know, I think the whole thing is like this great, you know, because people today right you try to like convince Someone of something that's all sciency like hey, you know micro-evolution or hey, you know freakin Quarks or something and they'd be like.

527
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:59,217
Scott: I don't see that it ain't real what you show me a picture You know show me some fossils or whatever you got right and the thing is well This dude a bajillion years ago all he saw was a bunch of dots moving around and he figured out that the earth was round and he figured out all the Orbits of all the planets.

528
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:03,538
Scott: and then when we made a rocket We saw and it was right.

529
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,166
Scott: So it's the same thing.

530
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:25,630
Scott: We can definitely absolutely using science figure out crazy shit and You know based on just like these like crazy Observations of the barest barest details and then later when the science improves We'll look and we'll probably be right just like we were right about all those things.

531
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:31,466
Rym: I mean, isn't it just awe-inspiring that we've mapped places that probably nothing we ever do will ever affect.

532
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:32,489
Rym: They're so far away?

533
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,768
Scott: Yeah, well, they're also probably no longer existing seeing as there's new things there.

534
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:44,570
Scott: Was there anything in the book that like, you know, I mean the book is such, you know old and proven science, right?

535
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:51,746
Scott: But so usually when you start reading about physics like you, you know My at least my brain does it likes to like come up with new physics like oh, what if this?

536
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:57,830
Scott: yeah What if that right and it's obviously all usually wrong or figured out by some physicists already?

537
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,610
Scott: So I try not to do that because I know that it's that it's wrong.

538
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:07,687
Scott: But did you come up with like any like, you know things like oh, man I think this I might have had a a discovery of physics.

539
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:11,989
Rym: Oh shit I did that a lot when I was a kid with black holes and stuff like that.

540
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:36,410
Rym: And now the only thing that I thought of when I was reading this that I think was novel in my brain But then Carl Sagan said it straight up later was you know He's talking about the structure of the universe and how you know the center of the universe could be a point outside of anything we can experience like if it like if there's a four-dimensional universe and The Big Bang, you know the center of the universe could exist in a space that is not accessible to us and our three dimensions.

541
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,246
Rym: You know things like that.

542
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:51,784
Rym: And he points out that if the universe is infinite and boundless or sorry non infinite But boundless because it wraps around on itself and all that that light cannot escape it and that effectively the universe is from the outside a black hole.

543
00:35:51,804 --> 00:36:00,052
Rym: Yep, and That threw me for a huge loop this time funnily enough because I was thinking about the Prince of Nothing Mm-hmm.

544
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:10,430
Rym: Yeah, because remember the whole idea of causality and the idea of free will and Morality and everything at least in those books and in a lot of philosophy comes out of the idea that if one thing begets.

545
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,525
Rym: Another thing there's an uninterrupted chain of causality from the Big Bang to the destruction of the universe if there is one.

546
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:22,112
Rym: Mm-hmm unless chains of causality from without are able to come within Mm-hmm.

547
00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:29,109
Rym: So imagine if the universe is just a big black hole or some equivalent of it or there is an outside that isn't.

548
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:30,749
Rym: that is a separate causal chain.

549
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:38,147
Rym: We've spawned everything we ever did from the Big Bang and that is the entirety of our experience that we could ever have our entire causal chain.

550
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:42,101
Rym: But things enter black holes from the outside and cannot escape.

551
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:46,715
Rym: so it's possible that things could enter our universe Sorry from the outside.

552
00:36:46,735 --> 00:36:47,558
Rym: It's got in the face.

553
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:48,742
Scott: It's not doing it.

554
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:49,705
Rym: who's the lifestyle.

555
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:51,352
Rym: I Don't know.

556
00:36:51,372 --> 00:36:56,147
Rym: I was thinking about that the idea that you know What could our universe be like from the outside even though?

557
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:01,709
Rym: Carl and every other scientist say that's not even a question we can ask because it has no relevance.

558
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:07,161
Scott: one thing I was thinking about right is like, okay Everything is red shifted Doppler effect.

559
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:07,682
Scott: Therefore.

560
00:37:07,743 --> 00:37:09,730
Scott: We know the universe is expanding, right?

561
00:37:10,717 --> 00:37:12,230
Scott: Anything you look at is red shifted.

562
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,944
Rym: Well, either things are moving away from us because universe expanding or you know space itself is expanding.

563
00:37:17,065 --> 00:37:18,870
Scott: same thing base effectively, right?

564
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,738
Scott: So here's the thing that I was wondering though.

565
00:37:20,778 --> 00:37:22,586
Scott: Nothing goes fast in the speed of light, right?

566
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,510
Scott: Yeah, okay.

567
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,700
Scott: So everything started in the Big Bang area and then spread out.

568
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:30,170
Scott: Okay, so let's say you and I are standing next to each other.

569
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,960
Scott: Right, I can see you and you can see me.

570
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:35,710
Rym: Yeah, remember there's already a speed of light to lay between us.

571
00:37:35,971 --> 00:37:37,619
Scott: I know that you're a billion years.

572
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,950
Scott: Let's say you're a billion light years away, right?

573
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:45,730
Scott: Well, I see you but I see you a billion years ago because you were standing there a billion years ago, right?

574
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:51,030
Scott: Yeah, so let's say you start right next to me because everything started right next to each other at the Big Bang, right?

575
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:55,350
Scott: And then you start running away from me and this goes on forever, right?

576
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,977
Scott: You can't go the speed of light.

577
00:37:57,219 --> 00:37:59,290
Scott: You can only go almost the speed of light, right?

578
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,937
Scott: So let's say you go.

579
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:02,706
Scott: I don't know 90% the speed of light.

580
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:03,350
Scott: you're running away.

581
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:12,109
Scott: Well, as long as I stand there and keep looking at you the light that hits you will pretend that light is always hitting you And bouncing off you and coming back to me.

582
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:15,525
Scott: Yeah, there's light always right infinite light.

583
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:20,930
Scott: So Basically if I stand there no matter how much you keep running.

584
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,178
Scott: I will always see you right no matter what.

585
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:23,640
Scott: Yeah.

586
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,119
Scott: Well, I might see you as you were X years ago But I'll still continue to see.

587
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:30,130
Scott: you will never disappear at any point.

588
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:37,239
Scott: if you there's always light shining on you and you're not a black hole and I keep looking at you and such right nothing.

589
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:37,440
Rym: Yeah.

590
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,010
Scott: Yeah, therefore would it not follow that?

591
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,120
Scott: Everything that exists in our universe is visible and there is no.

592
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,790
Scott: there's nothing hiding like beyond out somewhere else that we can't see.

593
00:38:49,171 --> 00:38:52,920
Scott: Because if something started next to us then we can still.

594
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:56,449
Scott: either it's a black hole and it's absorbing light or something there could be.

595
00:38:57,354 --> 00:39:00,030
Rym: Here's one way one of the multitude of ways that can be broken.

596
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:09,690
Rym: okay, there's an object that was shot out at 99% of the speed of light that was not emitting any light and Then due to its own internal reactions while it's moving it starts emitting light.

597
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:13,537
Rym: What when it's already a billion light years away?

598
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:19,895
Rym: that light won't reach us for a billion years plus the time that's added from the expansion of the universe in between us and it.

599
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:28,261
Scott: that is very possible, but that my point is, you know that there be the We look out in the universe and pretty much.

600
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:30,087
Scott: most things are emitting light, right?

601
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:33,220
Scott: I mean, we don't know Radiation black hole.

602
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,769
Scott: Yeah, they're emitting something right?

603
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:37,137
Scott: X-rays radio waves, right?

604
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:38,862
Scott: This is you know talking about astronomy, right?

605
00:39:39,103 --> 00:39:40,989
Scott: There's all kinds of emitting going on.

606
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:45,950
Scott: So I don't think you know, at least I'm not a physicist.

607
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,872
Scott: I'm probably very wrong as you know But I'm not.

608
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:56,030
Scott: I'm pretty convinced that there isn't that much stuff that is out there if we all started in the same spot.

609
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:57,797
Rym: Well, it's got two things that we can't see.

610
00:39:58,018 --> 00:40:00,650
Rym: one is not a perfect universe and shit gets in the way of light.

611
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:01,597
Rym: We're a tiny speck.

612
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:05,598
Scott: shit does get in the way of light But it's like, you know the farthest away there.

613
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:09,594
Scott: I don't think there's like some barrier like oh, it's a if it's you know The universe.

614
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:11,709
Scott: let's say the universe is a billion years old, right?

615
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,479
Scott: Then there it can't really be anything.

616
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,185
Scott: that's two billion light-years away.

617
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:17,867
Scott: can there be?

618
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:19,494
Rym: well the Sagan.

619
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:22,810
Rym: I think he pointed out straight up that I mean the universe is many more billions like.

620
00:40:23,432 --> 00:40:31,116
Rym: They saw two galaxies and for a while there was speculation that we were actually just seeing the Milky Way From the other direction.

621
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:31,879
Rym: Mm-hmm.

622
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,184
Rym: This isn't like the 20s.

623
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:43,429
Rym: Yeah, and then later Science taught us that no the universe is already clearly big enough to where light could not traverse the length of the universe In the time that the universe has existed.

624
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,975
Rym: hmm Now that could be screwed up.

625
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:50,610
Rym: by the way the universe expands because it's space itself that may be expanding.

626
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:54,225
Rym: Well, I guess I can barely wrap my head around as it is.

627
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:54,366
Scott: Yeah.

628
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:55,450
Scott: Well, what about this, right?

629
00:40:55,590 --> 00:41:05,203
Scott: What if we both started in the in the Big Bang area, right and you I went do north I guess whatever north is and you went do south and we were both going in 99% the speed of light.

630
00:41:05,284 --> 00:41:06,126
Scott: Yeah, right.

631
00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:09,848
Rym: So It's possible that we would eventually run into each other?

632
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:19,070
Rym: Well, no, but I'm not saying we're running into each other I'm saying would you still wouldn't disappear at any point right now because we'd both as if I'm moving away because you at the speed Of light and you're moving away from me at the speed of light.

633
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:25,512
Rym: I think the mean difference in speed between the two of us would still be the speed of light because it's all relative to the Speed of light.

634
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:28,790
Scott: Yeah, I mean think think about like two race cars, right?

635
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:36,918
Scott: So you got two race cars and one guy's driving one way and one guy's driving the other way on an infinite track Right and they both got.

636
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:39,688
Scott: look in the rearview mirror and they're looking at the other guy, right?

637
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:46,709
Scott: Even if both guys are going real close to the speed of light, right the light will still right.

638
00:41:47,393 --> 00:41:49,550
Scott: You know light you think about it.

639
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,069
Scott: Each guy is basically being chased by another car.

640
00:41:52,452 --> 00:41:55,490
Scott: That is the light car and the light car is going at the speed of light.

641
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:59,550
Scott: So the light car will always catch you because you're going less than it, right?

642
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,710
Scott: Even if you got a huge head start if I'm going one mile an hour There's still the catch you eventually.

643
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:09,750
Rym: Yeah, but there's still the propagation delay of the light has to bounce off and come back.

644
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:13,310
Rym: So it takes twice as much time plus the fact that you're constantly becoming further away.

645
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,716
Scott: Yeah, but it was you know, as long as the.

646
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:20,392
Scott: but if this like an infinite stream of light cars one is catching you at Every moment.

647
00:42:20,552 --> 00:42:22,457
Scott: Yeah, you know, so you're for the car.

648
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:26,569
Rym: the other car will never disappear further away when everyone hits you.

649
00:42:26,649 --> 00:42:30,424
Rym: Yes Of course the delay between each one coming back is the time.

650
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:33,702
Scott: the time is absolutely relative But the other car won't disappear.

651
00:42:33,743 --> 00:42:39,290
Scott: It will always be there No, but the speed and thus two stars going in the opposite direction from the Big Bang.

652
00:42:40,055 --> 00:42:42,050
Scott: They will always be able to see the other star.

653
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:49,265
Scott: They'll still see the star as it was a bajillion years ago But they'll still see it unless space is expanding at a rate that messes that up.

654
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:50,470
Scott: That's so we don't know.

655
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:51,192
Scott: I don't know.

656
00:42:51,915 --> 00:42:53,381
Scott: someone knows maybe not me.

657
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:54,405
Scott: Probably not me.

658
00:42:54,646 --> 00:42:55,509
Scott: Definitely not me.

659
00:42:56,071 --> 00:43:05,766
Rym: What I noticed though that one thing about cosmos and this format works really well for this sort of book is notice how he'll Start with something where he's vague and he says hey, so here's a fact.

660
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:06,750
Rym: Here's another fact.

661
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:15,550
Rym: Here's another fact and they lead you in a direction of where you're like Wait a minute if those things are all true, and then he asks you so what if blah?

662
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,775
Rym: What if blah?

663
00:43:18,197 --> 00:43:20,106
Rym: and he gets you trying to come up with the answer.

664
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:23,249
Rym: then he's like well The answer is actually blah and you're like, huh?

665
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:27,927
Rym: and then he talks about how they figured out the answer was blah and how awesome that story was.

666
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:32,001
Rym: and then he's like So if blah is true, then what about blah?

667
00:43:32,021 --> 00:43:37,789
Rym: and he always ends everything with speculation and a question Mm-hmm, like everything he always gives you all these facts then he's like.

668
00:43:38,312 --> 00:43:45,039
Rym: but the odds are this or but what if this or what if that and what if this and the what ifs always get in The end toward the point of and there is.

669
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,024
Rym: I don't have the answer for you.

670
00:43:46,105 --> 00:43:46,426
Rym: We don't know.

671
00:43:46,446 --> 00:43:47,150
Rym: we have to figure this out.

672
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,341
Scott: Yeah, well, I think it's very telling that the book is based on the TV show.

673
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:57,470
Scott: right because you know in the introduction He actually says that they're sort of separate and complimentary or whatever and they're you know, whatever.

674
00:43:57,611 --> 00:44:06,382
Scott: But the thing is each chapter is totally its own standalone thing You know, but you can tell that because he knows that this is the book.

675
00:44:06,904 --> 00:44:15,290
Scott: some of the chapters will be like yeah Kepler Sutton Sutton because he knows that you will probably read the chap the Kepler chapter earlier on, you know.

676
00:44:15,691 --> 00:44:19,124
Scott: Whereas in the TV show, there's no guarantee that you saw the previous episode.

677
00:44:19,184 --> 00:44:20,750
Scott: So it was structured a little different there.

678
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:28,882
Scott: Yeah, you know, but it's it's pretty cool that it's like each and every chapter is its own Deal as if it were an episode.

679
00:44:28,963 --> 00:44:37,534
Rym: the show itself is really good Like each one is self-contained and follows that format and it starts out by showing you cool stuff and explains it all then asks you More questions than ends.

680
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:38,056
Rym: Mm-hmm.

681
00:44:38,297 --> 00:44:39,361
Rym: Good music and stuff too.

682
00:44:39,742 --> 00:44:41,850
Rym: And I just like watching Carl Sagan listening to his voice.

683
00:44:42,232 --> 00:44:43,538
Rym: Yeah, he's a cool dude.

684
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:45,106
Scott: I was a cool dude.

685
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:48,649
Scott: Yeah What else do you guys say about this book?

686
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:54,890
Scott: I think you know the history parts of the book really helped me out because you know, I'm not too good at the chronologies.

687
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,929
Rym: Captain who who I came first Knights or Romans?

688
00:45:00,791 --> 00:45:02,838
Scott: Yeah, but you know, it was.

689
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:06,089
Scott: it was cool to actually because there's a bunch of science names, you know.

690
00:45:07,693 --> 00:45:09,470
Scott: And you know, I don't Kepler van Leeuwenhoek.

691
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:12,015
Scott: Yeah, and it's like you already.

692
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:12,837
Rym: did you already forget him?

693
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,362
Rym: What Kepler do?

694
00:45:15,585 --> 00:45:17,954
Rym: I don't remember what van Leeuwenhoek do I don't remember.

695
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:20,310
Scott: Ah, yeah, but you know, it's.

696
00:45:21,431 --> 00:45:28,095
Scott: It's cool that you know because that's not stuff that you're taught very much in school really, you know I wasn't straight up.

697
00:45:28,256 --> 00:45:31,786
Rym: In fact, all the physicists like the whole thing about wave particle duality with light.

698
00:45:32,548 --> 00:45:35,829
Rym: we in physics We actually did a history lesson on every single one of those people.

699
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:49,410
Scott: Yeah, our science classes didn't really teach us so much about the people's, you know, they might have mentioned someone's name once You know or they'd like I learn more about like Copernicus and social studies class than science class and reading cosmos.

700
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:54,310
Scott: What they told you about Copernicus is pretty wrong or at least lacking many important details.

701
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:58,683
Rym: So there's actually a book that Emily's dad lent her that I borrowed and read.

702
00:45:58,904 --> 00:46:02,550
Rym: and if you like the history part of this Like what the scientists did now?

703
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:07,630
Rym: They figured it out and what was going on at the time Bill Bryson wrote a book called a short history of nearly everything.

704
00:46:08,771 --> 00:46:09,794
Rym: And it's just that.

705
00:46:09,874 --> 00:46:15,010
Rym: it's like here's this scientist and here's what his deal was and some of these people were fucked up.

706
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:19,350
Scott: So it tells you all about like the people themselves.

707
00:46:20,772 --> 00:46:30,304
Rym: Just you know in the science interspersed much like how Carl Sagan does it in cosmos like with Tycho Brahe You know, he's crazy but also like what was going on between him and everybody else.

708
00:46:30,384 --> 00:46:37,670
Rym: and you know, and It like my favorite part of it is there's one guy who he had two great ideas.

709
00:46:37,973 --> 00:46:40,794
Rym: There were actually terrible ideas But he had no way to know at the time.

710
00:46:41,155 --> 00:46:47,279
Rym: the same dude who invented CFCs that destroy the ozone layer was also like lead in Gasoline that solves everything.

711
00:46:47,902 --> 00:46:49,330
Scott: Yeah, you know, he just didn't.

712
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,517
Scott: It's not that he was evil.

713
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,322
Scott: He just didn't know.

714
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:52,188
Rym: Well, he tested.

715
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:55,504
Rym: he was like I gave these people all this lead and they peed most of it out.

716
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:56,288
Rym: I don't think it'll hurt him.

717
00:46:56,308 --> 00:47:01,621
Scott: Let's go And that's true and it won't hurt you won't.

718
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:03,650
Scott: you won't notice anything immediately, you know.

719
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,810
Scott: And they you know, there's a lot of things where it's like people would have been cool.

720
00:47:07,971 --> 00:47:09,216
Scott: They just didn't know better.

721
00:47:09,236 --> 00:47:12,490
Rym: and it takes actually that I bring that up because I read an interesting article.

722
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:17,192
Rym: This is speculation on behalf of a bunch of sign and you wonder like, you know Who now?

723
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:22,590
Scott: will someone in the future look at and say we just didn't know better and you know currently what are we getting wrong?

724
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:23,913
Scott: We just don't know yet.

725
00:47:23,933 --> 00:47:25,839
Rym: It'll be like giant robo.

726
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:29,469
Rym: Yeah, exactly exactly like giant robo pretty much.

727
00:47:33,052 --> 00:47:33,975
Rym: So, I mean, I don't know.

728
00:47:34,035 --> 00:47:45,368
Rym: I feel like cosmos should be a textbook for like middle school kids and pretty much every science class ever like like every seventh grader should read cosmos or at least like big chunks of it as part of their schooling.

729
00:47:45,388 --> 00:47:46,191
Rym: because I think it Really?

730
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:54,446
Rym: It inspires people like it's written in the same way that a religious text might be written But it's just facts and speculation based on facts.

731
00:47:54,868 --> 00:48:10,530
Scott: Mm-hmm the other thing is you know, it's it's obviously like, you know, a lot of times the you know, These skeptical kinds of sciency people, you know They they're not very good at using the psychology and the coercion and all that, right?

732
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:20,086
Scott: But he manages to write this in such a way that is not like offensive or off-putting and say a Richard Dawkins kind of way talking is like there's no God.

733
00:48:20,107 --> 00:48:20,790
Rym: What are you stupid?

734
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,110
Rym: Yeah, but at the same second is like isn't this awesome?

735
00:48:24,411 --> 00:48:30,790
Scott: But at the same time right, he's not really doing it in sort of a morally evil trickery way.

736
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:33,518
Scott: He's not tricking you or like suckering you in.

737
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:40,939
Rym: he basically like he'll explain like here is the beauty of this like this Facet of the universe of the cosmos, isn't that fucking awesome?

738
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,673
Rym: now, maybe just some guy made it up or maybe this Look at this.

739
00:48:47,436 --> 00:48:50,585
Scott: Yeah, or he's like, oh, you know aliens are cool.

740
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:54,643
Scott: man wouldn't be awesome if they're aliens Let's figure out what the odds are.

741
00:48:54,743 --> 00:48:55,830
Scott: They're being aliens.

742
00:48:56,191 --> 00:49:05,673
Scott: What would aliens be like, you know, and then indeed approaches it, you know, realistically and then it's just like, uh-huh And now you know, it's like.

743
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:22,362
Scott: well, okay now we've discussed aliens and that's pretty awesome and we've also Realized that people who think that their cows were slaughtered by you know, moon men are crazy But we don't need to even mention that because we have just discussed You know the real part and we did not include anything about.

744
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,510
Scott: you know, moon men because there aren't any movement.

745
00:49:25,137 --> 00:49:26,190
Rym: I guess we can wrap it up here.

746
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:32,410
Rym: I mean, there's not much to say but praise for this book and I hope you read it and luckily there's nothing to spoil.

747
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,312
Rym: Spoilers Spoilers.

748
00:49:36,353 --> 00:49:39,107
Scott: the Big Bang is for real spoilers evolution.

749
00:49:39,168 --> 00:49:39,550
Scott: It works.

750
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:45,870
Rym: It's real say is I cannot imagine the person who would read this book and still deny the fact that the Big Bang happened.

751
00:49:46,394 --> 00:49:47,322
Rym: We don't know what or why.

752
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:48,290
Rym: there's a lot we don't know about it.

753
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:53,007
Rym: But to deny that an event like that happened is just ludicrous

754
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:58,187
Scott: like yeah I mean you'd have to like either not be able to understand you not understand the book

755
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:04,789
Rym: or Anyone with an IQ of a hundred probably even like 70 could understand the majority of what is in this book.

756
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:06,778
Scott: Yeah, I don't know.

757
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:09,650
Scott: or you know, you're just denying, you know, you have denial.

758
00:50:12,754 --> 00:50:25,406
Scott: You know, there are many, you know all sorts of reasons but You know or like a selective You know selectively choosing which parts to read and understand and which parts not to read and understand.

759
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:28,504
Rym: there dot-dot-dot is Dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dot.

760
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:37,285
Scott: God You know stuff like that, you know never underestimate the the ignorance of people.

761
00:50:37,806 --> 00:50:39,390
Scott: that is not something to be underestimated.

762
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:48,402
Scott: I actually really like the last line of cosmos - Mmm, the other thing is that it's funny how the you know the book.

763
00:50:49,084 --> 00:50:51,111
Scott: most of the stuff in the book Right is.

764
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:57,310
Scott: this is like old ultra proven science that you know, it was you know Determined over hundreds of years.

765
00:50:57,831 --> 00:51:00,018
Rym: I was watching through with Emily because she'd never seen it.

766
00:51:00,078 --> 00:51:09,330
Rym: some of like select episodes from the series, right and they had this introduction from a woman and then they had Carl Sagan come in and talk a few times where he was like.

767
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:14,589
Rym: So here's like some updates on this like yeah this spacecraft did this and we learned this.

768
00:51:15,311 --> 00:51:22,630
Rym: But from everything I can read there is almost nothing that is wrong in cosmos or that we have figured out later was wrong.

769
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,829
Rym: Speculation was later proven to be correct.

770
00:51:26,102 --> 00:51:35,678
Scott: Yeah it's the kind of stuff right in cut that's in cosmos is science that's so old and so rock-solid that if we're to if it Were to be unsolid did it would?

771
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,465
Scott: it wouldn't be unsolid.

772
00:51:37,485 --> 00:51:54,199
Scott: it like oh my god suddenly it would take a long time for us to find something that is, you know contradictory to what is already in there and Also, you know the a lot of this stuff was just you know Was true in its day and it just needed updates right?

773
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,410
Scott: For example, he's like, huh, you know, we we did this to Mars.

774
00:51:58,891 --> 00:52:03,265
Scott: What if we sent like a robot with wheels that could move around and shit?

775
00:52:03,405 --> 00:52:04,870
Scott: and it's like well, yeah, we did that.

776
00:52:05,472 --> 00:52:07,178
Scott: It's like 30 40 years.

777
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:14,509
Rym: It was really cool to see some of the updates where it was Carl Sagan himself You know 10 20 years later saying things like yeah, check out what we learned since then.

778
00:52:15,355 --> 00:52:17,049
Scott: Yeah, you know we it's pretty much.

779
00:52:17,411 --> 00:52:22,044
Scott: You know, we thought about doing this and then since then we did it and it was just like.

780
00:52:22,084 --> 00:52:23,889
Scott: I wrote mostly and there you go.

781
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:25,774
Rym: So I think that's it.

782
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:27,179
Rym: I hope you enjoyed cosmos.

783
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,290
Rym: I hope you and I will enjoy the lives of Locke Lamora.

784
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,536
Scott: I already read it.

785
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:35,084
Rym: It was very good and I leave you with this.
